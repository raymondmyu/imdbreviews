0,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,19 August 2016,"A movie of epic proportions. Lovers of film, animation, storytelling, do not miss out on this one!!!","Kubo and the Two Strings might be one of the best movies I've seen all year. In a crowded year of comic book movies, sequels, and remakes, that's probably not saying much. I wanted to be fair though and look at those movies with an open mind and a little background on their franchises for what each movie wanted to accomplish. However I've been waiting for so long to see something fresh, original, and holy cow this was it. Kubo is a stop motion animated film by Laika studios who've produced Coraline, Paranorman, and the Box Trolls. I really enjoyed Coraline and didn't really like Paranorman or the Box Trolls so I had no idea what to expect from this movie. My friend and I went opening night because the trailers looked interesting, and we were into the entire run time. It's so beautifully shot, the story is simple yet engaging, and the action is just amazing to behold. I don't want to give away anything about the story because I went into this movie blind not knowing that much and I think people should try to do the same. It's surprisingly also very funny! My friend and I just looked at each other shocked at how much this movie made us laugh. The characters are great and the voice work is very impressive. Everything about this movie is just so impressive. For little kids maybe it's not something to hold their interest, but older kids and adults I think should seriously consider checking this out. It's a fun, well written, and very emotional story. Not only should this movie win best animated feature so far, it should be nominated for best picture I'm serious! Lovers of film, animation, storytelling. PLEASEEEE go out and support this movie I heard it will have a low opening weekend and it's such a shame. We need to make this film a hit I want more animated movies of this quality, check it out!"
1,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,19 August 2016,Laika's Masterpiece,"""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is a hard movie to explain. There is a story in it and the adventure is grand and fun, but I can't place it into a category of traditional storytelling. The themes of the film are the values of memories and how we truly can never forget people that we lose throughout our lifetime. Very mature themes that are handled with such finesse and creativity that I can't say I have seen anything like it before. Even when you as the audience know where the story is headed, the film surprises you with the delivery and you actually grow and learn with the characters. The strength of the film is the pure visceral experience it provides. The visuals and sound had a layer of depth and drama that you feel in your inner core. It is more of an experience than it is a movie that you watch. Throughout the film, I felt moments of sadness, loss, happiness, horror, fear, and accomplishment. It is a movie that truly raises the bar for animation and it saddens me that many people will not check it out as it is very different from traditional animated films that we are used to seeing from other major animation studios. So much care and attention went into this film. The world Laika has created is rich with so much history, story, mythos, and culture that even some movies and series that are much longer can't fully create. I felt that the world is living and that magic is truly alive. I love how the character make it feel special that magic exists, but aren't put of by it, when they see it for themselves and have to question the logic.The characters are fun and lovable, but also brave and dimensional. Not one character felt out of place and they're inclusion felt important. The voice casting is top-notch and I felt like the celebrities actually made an effort. Unlike many big-budget animated productions, The voice actors weren't distracting and added their own layer of charisma that enhanced and drew attention to the characters. Monkey is probably the best character and I feel like she'll be the fan favorite as she's funny, powerful, and a total bada**.Overall, Laika has produced probably their best animated film to date and that is saying a lot from a studio that produces quality efforts time and time again. ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is unlike anything out there and deserves to be seen on the big screen. The animation alone is breathtakingly gorgeous. The beautiful score and music only adds to the complexity of the film. It is probably the best film of 2016 so far and I find it hard to beat. I highly recommend that people check out this highly creative experience."
2,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,17 July 2016,"Beautifully done, action-packed, great story","Attended a pre-opening screening of Laika's stop motion animated movie ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" yesterday and I have to say I totally loved it! The story is set in ancient Japan, where a young boy named Kubo cares for his ailing mother in a seaside Japanese village. He is a beloved storyteller who plays a magical shamisen (Japanese 3-string instrument). A spirit from the past turns Kubo's life upside down by re-igniting an age-old vendetta. In order to survive, he sets out on a quest to locate a magical suit of armor once worn by his late father, a legendary Samurai warrior. He makes friends and allies, encounters monsters and evil demons, and learns important lessons along the way. Visually, this is epically incredible and a game changer for stop motion. The action and excitement kept me on the edge of my seat. I wouldn't recommend it for really small children, though. There are times it's scary and the monsters are very well done! There's an excellent moral to the story and delightful humor, so children and adults will both enjoy it. Well done Laika. Best one yet!"
3,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,23 January 2017,killer combo; studio LAIKA + Charlize Theron,"Reviewers Notes; 1. As I write this, the top-rated IMDb review starts with the header ""a hard movie to explain..."" and that pretty much nails it. The film starts very slow, builds gradually, has the viewer hooked like a fish by the mid-point, and then falls a tiny bit short in the climax. But overall the experience is unforgettable, magical, and great fun.2. In Japan anime, they revere not only their movies but their studios. It was always considered that the NA studios, even Pixar, don't measure up. But Studio Laiko in this amazing film has done things with stop-motion and color which make it a world standard and as good as or better than the best that Japan has to offer. I am even going to use some frames a screen saver, they are THAT good.3. Lots of great voice acting but Charlize Theron steals, literally steals, the film and takes it to a new level. Makes you forget all about the goldfish that initially started the trend in ""star"" voices. Truly an incredible performance."
4,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,18 August 2016,"a plethora of imagination, invention, and a fusion of visual storytelling and myth","You know what I love in Kubo and the Two Strings (among several other things)? It doesn't go out of its way to explain its magic. It simply IS. Oh, sure, there's a talking monkey that saves the lead character Kubo (voiced by Art Parkinson, the monkey by Charlize Theron), and there's an explanation briefly (and then a later one, which I won't reveal at all), but it doesn't matter any more than how Kubo can use his guitar strings to make his origami turn into sword-wielding samurai, or how the former bodyguard named Beetle comes to be (Matthew McConaughey going back into his 'McConnaissance' mode as being a truly great performance expanding what we thought he's capable of a semi-comic sidekick).The filmmakers let the characters explain when they need to, yet when they do it's done in the form of storytelling - at one point when Monkey is finally pressed by Kubo (and Beetle too) to say what is going on with his otherworldly grandfather and his Aunt who is out to, well, kill him and what Monkey has to do with it, she can only tell it as Kubo plays his guitar and the papers for his origami go into the air to show as she tells. This is a film that loves storytelling and storytellers, and yet never forgets that this is a full-bodied CINEMATIC experience.I can't remember the last time I've recently seen so much imagination and visual invention in one fantastical animated film, stop motion or otherwise (not even Finding Dory, which certainly has both humor and some heartfelt moments, got to that this year). The story involves a little boy, who we are introduced to at the start as being saved/protected by his mother as a baby (with an eye cut out, by his grandfather), that is at the start making money by performing with his flying/magic origami in a village while tending to his mother who seems to be suffering from amnesia (as an aside, I knew I would love this movie about five minutes in when the filmmakers show us what this dynamic between son and mother is as the latter stares off into space with a haunted, sad look as the son tries his best to care for her, all without words, a perfect moment that I'd never expect to see in a kid's film in a multiplex kind of environment).But Kubo can't be out after dark, the evil sister of his Mother - with a black hat and white mask that makes her creepy past Burton-type standards - attacks, and Kubo is sent away and is knocked out. When he awakes Monkey is there and, soon after on this quest to find items that will help him face his evil Aunt and grandfather, the Beetle guard, and it becomes a hero's journey story. And what a hero and journey! There's a lot of action that the filmmakers pack into this movie - it is a Japanese fantasy-inspired film, so there may be some violent imagery that may scare the wee ones like under four of five, but most kids should be able to take it and, if I remember how I was at that age, love it - and it involves things like a giant skeleton monster that comes to life with swords stuck in its skull (and the three characters have to find which one is their unbreakable one), and, my favorite weird and wonderful creation, a group of underwater eyeballs that, when one looks too long at them, puts the person in a trance leading down to a... well, don't want to give it away.The voice-work is a delight which, as I said, McConaughey really digs into being a character who is the faithful protector though has some 'off' memory problems at times and a looser way of looking at protecting a child than Monkey (Theron plays the strict motherly figure as good as she's played any role, including Monster or Furiosa), and it becomes this story that's as much about family than it is about revenge or other petty things. You do have to pay attention, this isn't a movie that you can throw on for your kids and they can act crazy or get distracted: it asks that you watch it and take in a story that at its core isn't too far removed from Joseph Campbell, but does so many twists that it becomes its own original entity.Kubo and the Two Strings gives you all that you could want in a family animated movie, but more than that is a splendid, heart-rending fantasy epic in under 100 minutes. It brings me back to when I first saw something like The Dark Crystal and was amazed at what creators can do when they embrace really creating a WORLD that their characters can inhabit - not to mention keeping any humor to the situations or behavior, nothing that dates it at all. I can't recommend it enough."
5,Kubo and the Two Strings,5,21 August 2016,Interesting premise that doesn't know how to be told,"I am a pretty big fan of Laika. As a studio, they have brought a blend of stop-motion and CGI into the mainstream and have also tested much riskier subject material than other animation companies. Not only is their animation time consuming and risky, but their ideas are fairly risky as well (in today's market, that is).And Kubo is another interesting premise with beautiful animation, gorgeous backgrounds, and a nice style to it. It looks really good. Props to the animators. Stop-motion is advancing further and further with every movie Laika is making, and the stuff that is done in this movie would have seemed impossible to do only 7 years ago when Coraline was first released.The first 20 minutes of this movie are excellent and well-told!However, beautiful animation does not make a good movie...Story is the heart of a movie, and if you don't know how to tell a story, then you should go back to the drawing board (or storyboard). The biggest issue with Kubo isn't the most obvious one. The characters are nice, the animation is nice, the action is nice, and everything feels pretty solid, but what really kills this movie is the editing, the script, and its lack of solidity. In short: Kubo and the Two Strings doesn't know what it is.I could write a 10 page essay on the deeper issues of this movie, but that doesn't fit in one IMDb review. In Kubo, and lot of interesting ideas are brought up, but none of them fit together or are cohesive. For example, what is Kubo's motivation? Staying alive? Saving his mom? Beating his grandpa? Kubo never really gets true motivation until the third act and this is a major issue for the movie. The movie says Kubo is on an adventure, but he doesn't seem to feel the stakes until the final act, which is way too late in the game for us to care about him.The same goes with the villain. The background and motives of the villain are constantly changing and inconsistent. One second he wants to kill Kubo. Next second he wants his eye. Yet another second later, he just wants to help Kubo come to heaven with him. Then he hates everyone becomes they are human. Then his motives change to he just hates human because they could overthrow him. Then another motive where it is because he thinks they are disgrace.THIS IS A BIG ISSUE.For the villain's motivation and reasoning to be completely ambiguous and confusing completely ruins Kubo's arc... which is equally confusing and muddled. Essentially, both the villain and the protagonist are the weakest points of this movie. A movie can't really hold together with this big of a problem. And this issue is repeated throughout the movie where nothing is actually fully realized. For example: there is one scene where Kubo briefly loses control of his powers and it does something he didn't mean to do. Never mentioned again in the movie.The plot of his mother being sick and needing to be taken care of. Never fully explained or fully realized.Why the mom can't recognize her own husband when she sees his face? Why does the mom pretend she isn't kubo's mom (she says it is so he won't feel bad?!?!?). How come the mom told stories of the locations of all of the MacGuffins, but then doesn't know where they are?What did the moon king want with Kubo's eyes? Why does the moon king have Kubo's eye at the end when he is a human, but not when he is a spirit being? Why does the moon king become a human? Why does the town lie about his past? Why did Kubo trust the moon king in the dream, when his whole journey is to beat the moon king, but then when he sees the moon king he trusts him?*big spoilers* Why is there a red paper samurai? Why is there a red paper samurai once the beetle shows up, who is the actual real-life version of that samurai! Why didn't anyone recognize the beetle as the father, especially when the father's samurai armor appears to be sitting within that same cave? Why didn't anyone follow the red paper samurai to the last location of the armor? They followed it the entire time, but not at the end?Long story short, this list of character problems and inconsistencies is much longer than this, but a lot of these are pretty big plot problems and not just nit-picks. The finale of the movie is problem the worst element of the movie and not because it isn't visually stunning, but mostly because it is one character who has no tangible motivation versus someone else who hasn't had a very clear goal throughout the film. To make it worse, the movie doesn't even know what it is about. Is it about memories? Is it about death? Is it about stuck-up snobs? Is it an attack on tradition? Is it attacking perfectionists? What is the movie about? What makes this all the more frustrating is the fact that ParaNorman is a movie that has a similar premise, but it does it perfectly. The ending of ParaNorman works, because all of its themes tie together flawlessly. ParaNorman is a cohesive story and knows what it is saying. Kubo does not.Sadly, if you are expecting the next Coraline or ParaNorman, then prepare to be disappointed. This movie feels like a first-pass. A lot of ideas, but none of them mesh together or are completed."
6,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,13 August 2016,LAIKA has done it again!,"Those talented folks at LAIKA have done it again. KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS is not just one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year, period. Not since Pixar's ""Up,"" have death and loss been handled do firmly and delicately. ""Kubo"" is fun, moving, hopeful, and profound. A terrific story of bravery and acceptance.Written by Marc Haimes and Chris Butler and directed by LAIKA's own president, Travis Knight, KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS is set in a fantastical Japan where a one-eyed kid who masters the art of origami and storytelling, Kubo, (voiced by Art Parkinson of ""Game Of Thrones"") would go out to work to earn money during the day by entertaining audiences in the middle of a market but he comes home right before sundown to tend to his sick mother, it has to be before sundown because at night, his mother's sisters, two evil twins (voice day Oscar nominee Rooney Mara) would try to get Kubo's other eye. The past catches up to them, an old vendetta resurfaces, Kubo must run and join forces with Monkey (voiced by Oscar winner Charlize Theron) and a beetle (voiced by Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey) on a quest to retrieve the helmet, the sword unbreakable and the armor that would prepare Kubo to fight the vengeful Moon King (voiced by Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes). This quest would unlock Kubo's family mystery and lead him to fulfill his destiny.I've always appreciated animation, but with stop-motion, it's extra level of appreciation, knowing the extra hard work they put into even just to get a few seconds of shots. It's a level of dedication and discipline that never ceases to blow my mind, that's why I'm a huge fan of LAIKA. Especially with this latest film of theirs, the scale is much bigger, there's a sequence involving a large skeleton giant, your brain starts to wonder as you see that scene just how many hours, how many weeks, how many months did it take for them to make that happen.This film has action, it has love drama, it has family drama, it has a great sense of humor and it's also about community coming together to help one another. It has its own way of featuring and respecting Japanese art and tradition, but even if you're not too familiar with that particular culture, KUBO resonates much deeper than just the aesthetics. It's a film that's perfect for the whole family. And on top of that, it delicately teaches our young ones about how to grieve in a healthy manner. There's also a twist to the story which I won't spoil for you here. This film is just so beautiful and pristine. Charlize Theron has that commanding voice you would follow to the ends of the earth. And Matthew McConaughey voices Beetle as playful and as proud as Tim Allen did Buzz Lightyear. So it's a combination of outstanding stop motion animation, excellent voice talents, a well-told story and strong characters that make KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS one of my favorite this year.-- Rama's Screen --"
7,Kubo and the Two Strings,2,8 March 2017,Disappointingly Dull,"The animation is very well-done, but the character and environment designs are uninspired.Despite marketing focusing on Kubo's ability to animate origami figures, he RARELY uses this ability. It's RIDICULOUS. You expect that the film would carry some semblance of him getting more experienced at using his powers for things other than storytelling, but they all but disappear after the first act of the story. Despite the focus on Kubo's shamisen, the soundtrack of the film is very ordinary and unmemorable. It sounds like every other mediocre American film for the most part, when you would expect Japanese influence, especially in the form of... oh, I don't know, a SHAMISEN?Action scenes are somehow dull. It's tough to describe, but they lack energy or the feeling of peril and there are a lot of ""saved at the last minute"" moments. Like, multiple per fight scene. The main characters fight a giant skeleton and it just feels... boring. The fight takes place within a very closed space, which makes the monster look small instead of imposing. The characters don't really use any strategy in the fight, they just seem to let the plot take hold and follow a series of random actions.Voice acting is alright. I liked Charlize Theron as the strong, but motherly figure, but nobody else stood out and Matthew McConaughey feels horribly miscast. The lack of Japanese actors wouldn't bother me so much, if not for the fact that someone seemed to feel obligated to shove them in somewhere, resulting in George Takei, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and a few other Japanese-American actors playing extremely small roles who very well could've been played by anyone. The humour is very clumsy. There are a few times when a joke lands, but most of the time, they're just taking up time that should've been used to expand a character, explain a plot element or enhance the mood of the story. Despite being set in ancient Japan, the Japanese influence is barely tangible. For example: Kubo's father was apparently a samurai, but there's nothing indicating this beyond his armour and the fact that characters say he was. Nothing about the society at the time is really exemplified - the movie could be set pretty much ANYWHERE if names and some aesthetics were changed. Also, despite being an adventure, the world the story takes place in feels impossibly small in a way I rarely experience with a film. Kubo is not an interesting hero, he does not get much character, and never seems particularly motivated by anything other than an insistence by other characters (namely his mother / the monkey) that he HAS to be on this journey. The film (especially near the end) tries to play to the audience's emotions but it does not express enough genuine emotion itself. Also, irritatingly, his whole journey doesn't really reward him with anything, and he doesn't really change because of it. It never felt like he NEEDED to go on it to learn a lesson or gain experience or ANYTHING except that without it there wouldn't be a movie.The villains were uninteresting as their motivations are mostly unclear, and stupid. Like... Kubo's grandfather wants to take his eyes and make him live on the moon with him in order to have him not experience the cruelty of life, but... why does he need to take his eyes? It's oddly convoluted and mixes metaphor and literal actions in a way that will just make you question the plot and if anyone decided to even edit the thing. I have patience in SPADES when the subject is interesting, but Kubo's story is incredibly clichéd, predictable and boring. I felt like I was constantly waiting for the plot to pick up and for things to be explained or implied, and being ultimately unsatisfied. It was a very shallow plot with shallow characters. Overall, the plot feels like a bunch of half-baked ideas stitched together. They work as separate concepts, but altogether they don't relate to or complement each other, or give explanation, or often even make sense. Why was Kubo's father turned into a giant beetle rather than killed or turned into something less threatening like... a small beetle? Why is Kubo's mother so sick or mentally scarred in the beginning, but only sometimes? Don't ask questions. Clearly the writers didn't. (Many other users have left reviews pointing out minor, but ultimately compounding questions they had about the story. It's almost shocking how much of the plot is logically inconsistent.) There are twists in the film, but if you're remotely familiar with movies in general, you'll probably figure them out at least 40 minutes before they're revealed.I can go on. There's a lot wrong with the movie, but overall, it can be encapsulated with ""boring and predictable, yet somehow a bit confusing"". Clearly some people enjoy it, but I just found it disappointing. Some people might find the animation worth the watch, but while impressive, I didn't find it particularly visually interesting.Instead I'd recommend watching a Studio Ghibli fantasy film, such as Spirited Away or The Tale of Princess Kaguya. If you're into video games, play Okami. All of these take Japanese mythological ideas and work them into much more entertaining results, even if you aren't incredibly familiar with the source material. If you're looking for stop-motion animation, I'd greatly recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox, and Laika's previous exploits of Coraline and Paranorman."
8,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,18 August 2016,Animated Artistry,"If this film was told from another perspective, Kubo and the Two Strings might be considered a bit preachy. It still might be, regardless. But no matter how you look at it, it is something to be looked at more than once. It is simply an amazing work of animated achievement in cinema.Set in what could be medieval Japan, a little boy named Kubo scratches out a meager existence on the village streets earning just enough for him and his mother to survive. For her part, mom (voiced by Charlize Theron) sits at the mouth of their mountaintop cave in a comatose state every day until dusk. This is also the time when Kubo must be home, not only to be there when she snaps out of it to regale him with stories of his long lost warrior father, but so he can be safe from the evil that bewitched his mother and left him with only one eye. Failing to do this one fateful night forces Kubo on a journey to recover mythical armor and weapons that will beat back the forces of darkness and restore love and harmony to his life and the lives of others. Aiding him on his quest are a miniature monkey carving come to life, an origami samurai, and a beetle/man warrior (Matthew McConaughey).What is truly exceptional about Kubo and the Two Strings is not the story. The characters have American English accents and are not Asian. A couple characters aren't really fleshed out (those of Brenda Vaccaro and Ralph Fiennes for example). Although the film is geared toward a younger audience, there are deep themes of rebirth and reincarnation that are a major part of the movie and seem heavy handed, as was hinted at earlier. The story is not the star, the presentation of the story is what shines.Anyone who is familiar with Laika studios work (Coraline, The Boxtrolls) will not be disappointed in how Kubo and the Two Strings looks. For the uninitiated, be prepared to see a film that hearkens back to the old style of painstaking, stop-motion animation with a splash of 21st century wizardry. These filmmakers have done what other strive to do with budgets two, four, even six times larger. They have made an animated world that pulls you in with its realism. It doesn't come off as cartoon like. Eyes glisten, teeth are almost translucent, hair blows in the wind, characters have shadows. Any shortcomings in the script are quickly forgiven when the evil sisters float into the scene or when Kubo (Art Parkinson) captivates the town folk with his storytelling. It's the attention to detail, the craftsmanship, and artistic appreciation that sets films like Kubo and the Two Strings apart from other animated feature films. The filmmakers have learned a lot from the old masters and have served notice that they are at the top of their game. Just sit back and let them and their latest undertaking work their magic on you.www.mediumraretv.org"
9,Kubo and the Two Strings,5,13 October 2016,"Well crafted visuals, paper thin story.","I expected big things from Kubo. Those expectations were met on a purely superficial level. The film looks beautiful and the meticulousness of the stop motion craft is clear for all to see, but the story had major problems.After the striking opening of mother and son caught in a tumultuous storm that dashes them against rocks and washes both ashore, we have a watchable, if slightly dull 20 minutes of exposition and establishing character goals before it quickly devolves into a predictable rehash of the 3 act hero structure. The young, one-eyed, but infinitely resourceful Kubo sets off on a quest to find 3 fabled pieces of armour so he can do battle with his evil grandfather up in the heavens, who just can't stand humans and their silly ""feels"" (but you know of course that 'feels' are exactly what will triumph in the end (cue eye-roll)).The ease in which Kubo finds these items in such quick succession doesn't really feel suitably epic and there's no real sense of how far he actually has to travel, he just always conveniently ends up right where he needs to be. There's no real sense of danger either, despite the odious threat of his sinister aunts coming to steal his good eye so they might blind him to humanity, you never once feel like this might actually happen. Overall, it felt to me like the writers thought up a bunch of cool set pieces they could throw at the viewer, and then tried to weave a script around those. The 'banter' between Kubo's companions Monkey and Beatle, serves as empty filler between action sequences; Their constant squabbling is over-played and annoying. It also bugged me that despite the lovingly realized visual depiction of ancient Japan, the characters acted and sounded so American.The menacing twin aunts (voiced by Rooney Mara) and the fantastic origami action were high points and very entertaining. However, mostly I was bored and consciously predicting lazy story arcs. It just wasn't a satisfying experience and it's a shame for Laika to spend so much time and effort crafting animation for a contrived, generic story which failed to deliver any emotional weight."
10,Kubo and the Two Strings,5,18 May 2017,Wanted to Like This a lot More,"Before watching Kubo and the Two Strings, I was aware of the great reviews the film had received, with some calling it the best animated movie of 2016. Having now watched it, I agree that as far as actual animation goes, this movie is very visually impressive. With the fight scenes in particular, it is impossible to imagine the effort put into the incredible stop-motion in this movie. This movie is undoubtedly amazing in its actual animation, however unfortunately in my opinion that is where its praiseworthy aspects begin and end. I personally found the story of Kubo to be very cookie cutter. Not bad by any means, but painfully average. I didn't find myself caring much about any of the characters, and while watching fight scenes, as I mentioned I was impressed visually, however I was disappointed to find myself not caring what happened to the main characters as a result of the fighting. There is a twist revealed at the end of the second act of this movie which I won't reveal, however I personally was able to figure it out thirty minutes before it happened. The dialogue between Kubo, Monkey and Beetle I thought was very cliché, with Monkey having a slightly humorous pessimistic attitude, and Beetle taking the role of comic relief for the most part. However, through out this whole movie, I did not chuckle even once. All of the jokes felt like anyone could have written them and put them in any average kids movie to me. And perhaps that is why I did not enjoy this movie as much as I hoped I would; it is a kids movie. Granted, many Pixar movies, as well as other stop-motion animation movies like Fantastic Mr. Fox and Coraline (the latter of which was done by the same people as Kubo), I feel are able to be enjoyed equally by adults and kids. This movie felt almost entirely for kids to me. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, in fact I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for something to let their kids or a kid they know watch. This movie is not bad by any means, I suppose it just simply was not for me. With all of the positive reviews for it though, I would say everyone should watch it and form their own opinion, as perhaps there was just some element I was missing. As of now though, I unfortunately came out of watching this film disappointed."
11,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,19 August 2016,"Outstanding! Original, beautiful and heartful","I love this movie. It is original, beautiful to watch and has heart and soul. The quirkiness of this movie only adds to its lovability. It is hard to find an original movie and using origami as the base of this movie is simply genius.Kubo's grandfather has stolen his eye and now is after the other and he will do whatever he has to, to get the other eye. His two aunts are frighten witches. His mother has lost all her memories and many dangers await Kubo and his only helpers are a monkey and a silly half man, half beetle and an endless supply of paper. I know this all sounds totally crazy, but it all works together quite nicely to make this incredible movie.I struggled once trying to make an origami swan so I appreciate the origami in this film which has a mind of its own. Kubo plays a two- stringed instrument which transforms simple paper into magnificent, magical shapes and forms. The voice-overs in this film are stupendous and really bring it to life. My favorite character is Kubo (Art Parkinson) who is just so adorable yet strong, independent and goodhearted. My other favorite is Monkey (Charlize Theron) who is brave, funny, clever and very stubborn. I love her character because of all these traits. Even though she is tough, she has a kind, sweet side that she shows how much she loves her son. There is also the beetle (Matthew McConaughey) who is hysterical, dangerous and a straight shooter or, at least according to him he is. I love his character because its funny and had me belly laughing. His affection for Monkey is adorable. Of course, there are villains of this film. The sisters, both played by Rooney Mara portrays them as crazy, wacko witches and her voice is perfectly scary. The other villain, The Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) is the weird Grandfather who wants Kubo's other eye and he is super creepy.One of my favorite scenes is when Kubo, Monkey and Beetle are trying to defeat a giant skeleton and find the sword of unbreakablity. It is adventurous and funny. The graphics are incredible, especially the way they created the skeleton. This is the biggest clay animation character ever made. I thought this action scene was intricate and believable.I recommend this film for ages 7 to 18. Adults will like it too. I do want to suggest that if your child is younger than 7, they might get scared with the darkness and the villains, but if they can accept that it is all fake then they will be okay. I rate this film 5 out of 5 magical origami stars. Reviewed by Morgan B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
12,Kubo and the Two Strings,1,4 December 2016,An interesting concept that was developed in a really confusing way,"""I know that my stories tend to get a little long"". A perfect definition of Kubo about himself and also about his movie.Instead of showing us a story, Laika decided to tell them through some paper tails that happen during punctual conversations between the characters, who are just walking around through the entire movie. Their long walking is filled with random fights that make no sense and many, many parents (I counted two moms and three dads) because apparently everyone/everything in the world (and beyond it) is related to Kubo. And this boy might be really cursed because every time he finds out someone is one of his parents, the person dies.In a sea of drama with some forced humour moments, everybody is always about to die until the last second when someone bravely saves them out of nowhere. And then, out of nowhere again, they're laughing and becoming best friends, then in the next second someone is about to die again and we repeat the cycle until they actually die. The writers were just throwing things on us and finding excuses to justify those parallel stories they wanted to tell. The justification for Kubo losing his eye? COME ON!It is really obvious that they put way more effort into the visuals than in the story, as the characters are beautiful but really empty and senseless. The problem is that even visuals tell stories and if you have nothing to tell, the designs and backgrounds might look beautiful but they will be really blend and generic, nothing really pops up in that world, there's nothing singular about it.The movie is called Kubo and the Two Strings and I still don't know what that instrument is and why it gives him powers or what the heck his powers are and what exactly is his mom or his dad or something And what's their deal with death anyway? I know they wanted to show a different vision of death and mourning, but it's used in a way and intensity that seems like they are obsessed about it.I was really stoked to watch this movie, but I'm really disappointed now. Sorry if it seems harsh, but it's just how I feel about it..."
13,Kubo and the Two Strings,3,9 September 2016,What did I miss?,"Can someone please tell me what this film was about? The visuals were great and the actors also but the end of the movie had me scratching my head. It left me feeling ultimately unfulfilled. How is it that the evil and all powerful grandfather turns into a meek half blind feeble old man with no memory? Where did his 2 aunts go? And why were they wearing masks the whole time? Something must have actually happened as his parents did die so this story was not just a fantasy the boy was having about his cranky grandfather. Why did his grandfather remove the boy's eye and want to take the other one too? My friend and I just looked at each other when the film was over, not sure what to think. We had gone through a beautiful adventure, one that ultimately did not make sense to either one of us. Had I known that this film was 99% about art and 1% about plot, I know I would not have gone."
14,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,5 October 2016,So much potential,"Really disappointed. While the movie excels in visuals and animation department, it is let down by the weak writing/story. The dialogues have no impact, the conversations between monkey and the Beetle could have been so good, and it TRIES so hard to be funny and yet falls flat. They are just, naive. That's the best word to describe them. Naive. Immature. They seem to have been written by a 12 year old. The story is ambiguous. It's a fight between good and evil yet it doesn't take one definite theme. What is the Evil after? What does the good stand for in this particular instance? It seems all the resources for the movie were spent on the animation with little to spare for the story and dialogues. The worst thing is its a little too mature for kids, yet not enough to engage an adult. So much potential, wasted."
15,Kubo and the Two Strings,4,21 December 2016,Interesting but empty,"So I watched Kubo, which has absolutely nothing to do with Bleach and thus has no Bankais. I didn't find it bad as I found it empty. Nothing much happens to keep you engaged, and this comes from someone who is not part of the smartphone generation. My attention span is much higher than 5 seconds and I still had the urge to skip forward or multitask for half of the movie.Every scene plays out in a very basic way, which seems fine when you describe it, but is otherwise not excusing the duration or the scope of the story. On paper you have deities invading from the moon and want to stop a boy and its animal companions from gathering the pieces of an armor that can rival their king. And they travel through stormy seas and caves full of undead, while fighting flying kung-fu witches. Sounds amazing but when you actually see it, it's like ah, is that all? I otherwise like the themes in the story. The conflict is mostly internal, characters are fleshed out on a basic level, and the stop-motion they used looks amazing. None of that excuse a movie's worth of duration. You almost never see more than 3 characters on screen, and whatever they are doing is not keeping you engaged. The world felt like it was just one village and random monster encounters. It never felt like it was bursting with life.I didn't even like the battles. They look spectacular for a few seconds but they otherwise don't have any actual flow or strategy in them. And I have to point this out; last moment saves are abundant. You can count a dozen times when Kubo is in danger and someone jumps out of nowhere to save him. It's full of fake tension which makes you not believe the characters are in any actual danger.I don't even think most of the battles and the adventure were significant in the longrun. Kubo went through all this mess just to do something he already knew about all along. He didn't learn it, he hadn't forgotten it, he didn't even have to realize it. It was always there. Getting the armor meant nothing in the end because it still came down to the power of friendship. Which he used in the village the story begins in. Which means he didn't need to go on a journey, he could have simply stayed there and used the damn power since the very beginning. What was the point of the adventure? And I am not done with the complaints, I didn't even like how fast Kubo trusted those animals. He didn't grow up with them, they were not his friends, they were strangers who appeared out of nowhere and insisted they have to help him. Which they do. Over a dozen times. With cheap last moment saves. My point is, there is not much chemistry amongst the major characters. They are unfamiliar to each other, thus they feel more like plot devises so Kubo can have someone to talk with, or to save his ass from every monster he encounters. And yes, by the end of the film you learn those animals are not really strangers to him, but it's only because the bad guys were infodumping in the middle of the battle and not because the animals revealed it themselves.Furthermore, we have zero characterization for the bad guys. We know nothing about them besides being evil and supposed living on the moon. We don't even see the moon. We never seem them outside the scenes they are attacking Kubo, which makes you not care about them. Two of them go as far as wearing masks so they can look even more inhuman, and the third which has a face eventually mutates into an ugly monster which you would want to see dead. So lazy! So basically, the creators focused only on the moral message and the stop motion, while doing very little for excusing a whole movie about them. And although I understand this is basically aimed at kids, the ending was anti-climactic. It made a dull adventure no kid will be paying attention to (because they will be playing with their smartphones) feeling pointless because it came down to the souls of the dead coming to save the protagonist with the power of friendship because he was really passionate while playing the lute. Boring!"
16,Kubo and the Two Strings,5,17 November 2016,Good for kids...maybe?,"This is a well animated film, the kid does have a punchable face though overall good, the music is pretty good too, McConaughey also OK, that's not enough to elevate this beyond an average kids film.The plot is simple and very very formulaic I don't mind this too much it's something I can forgive entirely but so much about this film rubbed me the wrong way, I found the characters annoying and corny, the jokes were mostly not funny and the dialogue was cringey. The sappy ending were he defeats his grandfather in centipede form with a cheesy monologue and guitar strum made me want to puke. I'm surprised by the critical acclaim, outside of the few positives I mentioned you are not left with much. It's not terrible, OK for kids I suppose but I could think of a dozen better family films certainly not up there with the best"
17,Kubo and the Two Strings,,18 August 2016,"By the time the talking monkey shows up, it never once feels out of place.","Young Kubo (Art Parkinson) lives a simple life on a small island village. At night, he cares for his frail mother, who suffers from bouts of amnesia. But during the day, Kubo fervently entertains the townsfolk with music, magical origami, and fantastical tales of heroic samurai on treacherous crusades. One evening, while Kubo participates in a customary ritual to receive guidance from his departed father's spirit, he inadvertently ignores his mother's warnings not to stay out past nightfall and is accosted by two powerful witches (both voiced by Rooney Mara). His mother comes to his aid, but must sacrifice herself to allow him to escape. Awakening in a snowstorm with a strange monkey (Charlize Theron) as his only friend, Kubo must embark on a quest of discovery just as mystical and perilous as those he once told.""Pay careful attention to everything you may see or hear."" There's something striking about the choice repetitions of significant lines, and something reservedly powerful about the opening moments, featuring a mother who bares physical scars to match those of her son. And the use of a diminutive storyteller to narrate and shape his own skein of adventure and tragedy is particularly inspiring, especially as he bravely confronts the heartbreak of tending to the gaps in memory and the spells of stupor that overtake his mother's normalcy. It's all part of the groundwork for a mesmerizing odyssey.Masterfully blending together Oriental high fantasy (or a romanticization of Japanese feudal military aristocracy), Greek mythology, and an Americanized viewpoint on action and heroism, ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is seemingly anachronistic in its cultural suggestions and verbiage (though nevertheless sharply scripted) as it sets about constructing an epic expedition through an orphic land. Despite resorting to formulaic processes for its protagonists, for the great evils that target them, and for the supernatural heraldry that protects them, few moments can be directly compared to any other animated picture. The witches are perfectly diabolical - and entirely uncommon for a family-friendly venture - while a bone golem, a paper samurai, and a boat of leaves are each wholly original manifestations. The artistry on display is of the extremely imaginative, highly visual kind, creating a notable style for its world that Laika Entertainment appears to have cornered (predominantly in its use of stop-motion animation and massive armatures, previously employed for ""Coraline"" and ""Corpse Bride,"" among others).The plot tends to wander in the middle of the film as the basic components of a grand adventure weigh on the uniqueness of the individual missions, which occasionally fail to transition or relate to the overarching concepts as smoothly as the should. Similarly, the editing together of a few scenes is abrupt, as if segues was cut out for time. But it does succeed handsomely at the start. Setting a tone and introducing characters are efficiently handled tasks, but steadily incorporating the magical elements is done superbly. By the time the talking monkey shows up, it never once feels out of place. The possessed folded paper, the phantasmal music, and the winning expressions on strangely palpable faces are all natural, amusing pieces of this vivid trek of continual wonderment and excitement.The Massie Twins"
18,Kubo and the Two Strings,4,20 September 2016,Half-baked mishmash,"After hearing a lot of buzz about ""Kubo,"" I had high hopes for this movie. Ultimately though, it's a very mediocre film that never delivers anything satisfying unless you're just in it for the spectacle. All the massive hype for this film left me hugely disappointed, so I put some thought into what went wrong with the story & the characters.It feels like they took 15 scripts and hastily patched them together in one afternoon. The central concept is that Kubo has magic powers to bring origami figures to life, but the movie COMPLETELY forgets this by the third act and it never comes up again. When the movie forgets its basic plot hook, you know the script is a colossal mess.There are lots of half-baked ideas that go absolutely nowhere: Kubo has an old lady friend who quickly disappears and never does anything important. He hears that his village has burned down (for all he knows, killing everyone he's ever known), but in the next scene he's laughing and cheerful like nothing happened. The villain has no coherent goal. The dialogue consists of clichés, followed by lousy comic relief, followed by characters tediously monologuing like they're trying to put you to sleep. Even though it hits you over the head with these monologues, the movie fails to convey any actual message or point!The plot is borderline nonexistent, so the characters should be the backbone of the film. Let's look at the cast! Kubo himself has as much personality as a sheet of cardboard. He had no clear motive at any point; you never relate to him or care about him. He just muddled through the story like a gutless blank slate.He's helped on his journey by a monkey, who is the worst ""sassy sidekick"" I've ever seen. She just sounds surly and petulant most of the time; I guess it's supposed to be funny, but it's only annoying. Her voicework is horribly directed. When she doesn't sound whiny, she blandly recites lines in a stilted, melodramatic way. There's a plot twist that's supposed to make her more relatable, but it just comes across as cheesy melodrama & adds nothing to the story. The script claims that she has a meaningful relationship with Kubo, but the characters never clicked or showed chemistry.Kubo is also joined by a comical & jolly samurai, who is easily the only likable character in the film. He's lively, he's upbeat, and we actually SEE him form a friendship with Kubo. He never builds any real depth though; there were many chances to show a more serious or grim side under his cheerful exterior, but he stays a 2-dimensional goofball. When that's the best part of the story, it doesn't bode well.Due to the flat characters and nonexistent storyline, there was no tension whatsoever in the film. There were incredibly bland action scenes, but there was no sense of stakes or risk. For instance, this movie features a giant skeleton monster and manages to make him look harmless and boring, slooowwwwly shuffling along like he's half- asleep. There are no thrills, no excitement, no heart. You can tell people put a lot of hours and money into the film, but absolutely no sincerity or sense of purpose.That's a lot of words, but I walked out of this movie very disappointed and wanted to give a clear reason why. Overall, ""Kubo"" is a mediocre popcorn flick. The technical animation quality is good, but it's a big- budget Hollywood production so that's no impressive achievement. Many people will be easily-impressed by the big-budget effects, but if you want a film with an actual story, decent characters, heart, competent voice directing, and/or a POINT, you will miss absolutely nothing if you skip ""Kubo""."
19,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,23 August 2016,"Bravo, Kubo!","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5 )  THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: An animated film brimming with stunning visuals.  GRADE: B+  SYNOPSIS: A young boy goes on a quest to find a magic helmet and armor  to protect himself and others from evil forces.  JIM'S REVIEW: Laika Studios (Coraline. ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls) has  long been pioneers in stop-motion animation, a time-consuming and  difficult art form. This studio has always set a high bar in terms of  animation, although its storytelling never quite equal that pinnacle of  success. With Kubo and the Two Strings, it has finally combined the two  and has created a joyous and totally satisfying film experience.  ￼Kubo (Art Parkinson) is a master storyteller who charms the villagers  with his imaginative tales and origami skills. As his stories unfold,  literally, so does this film. Colorful sheets of handmade papers glide  through the air and form various objects in such graceful and  enthralling ways, animation-wise. We learn of his story, of his past  life, and the dangers that await in his future. We meet Kubo and begin  his journey with new comrades like Monkey (Charlize Theron) and Beetle  (Matthew McConaughey) as they travel from one peril to the next.  ￼The screenplay by Mark Haimes and Chris Butler has an epic feel and  keeps the action sequences moving at a fast pace after a leisure  beginning as its sets up its character and the interrelationships of  this trio of adventurers. The direction by Travis Knight is impeccable.  He envisions surreal worlds that are masterful created by him and his  creative team. In general, the voice-over work is strong and appealing  too, especially by Ms. Theron, Ralph Fiennes as the Moon King, and  Master Parkinson in the title role. There is also fine work from George  Takei, Brenda Vacarro, and Rooney Mara in smaller roles. However, Mr.  McConaughey's vocals never quite blend with his character, but, in his  defense, the character needed better development on the written page  and in its animated form.  ￼At times, the words sound like second-rate bromides from a fortune  cookie factory, but the imagery is consistently outstanding and awesome  to behold. There is so much artistry that it overwhelms...in the best  of ways. A magical sword cuts waves in two...a large red skeleton looms  over its prey...black smoke bellows around a village, enveloping it...a  sea of glowing eyes fills its watery surroundings...blue paper-folded  birds fly with their real counterparts before rapidly converting into  mosquitoes...golden leaves float effortlessly and create a ship of  wonders. (One long and memorable sequence involving a fluorescent  metallic serpent is spectacular state-of-the-art animation.)   ￼Beside the remarkable stop motion work, special mention must go to  Dario Marinelli and his musical score which melds perfectly with the  imagery on screen. His use of atonal chords and dissonance reflect the  Japanese sounds beautifully and enhance the overall impact of the film.  There are some minor, very minor. missteps along the way (Mr.  McConaughey disappoints whenever his Southern drawl slips in and out of  character, most jarringly, the spiritual symbolism of the narrative  gets heavy-handed, and the dialogue has a modern edginess that  conflicts with this ancient narrative story-line).  ￼That said, Kubo and the Two Strings, is easily one of the best  animated films this year...and one of the best films as well. Bravo,  Kubo!"
20,Kubo and the Two Strings,2,24 August 2016,"Lazy, uninspiring & schematic writing, suitable for very small kids","Reading this film was supposed to be ""a new animated classic"", I truly hoped for a different experience - imaginative, mind stimulating and heart filling, as some of the classics truly are. However, ,this film, that claims to present a child-storyteller as a protagonist, fails a colossal failure in its storytelling above anything else. It could be a good match for those who visit the cinema for the visual thrill only (if there can be any such creature??), but those who wish to find a soulful plot, clever dialogue and inspiring characters are about to have an ailing time, which will induce serious wondering about all the forces who collaborated to make this film happen, not noticing how corny, lifeless and utterly tedious is the script, and eventually the actual film, despite the ""action scenes"", which are aimed to blur the film's emptiness and fool us that something important is happening. Alas, no such thing is happening, let me assure you. Better pick up your copy of Spirited Away and avoid this film, which only gives American animation a hard blow in the gut. My suggestion to the makers - dub it anew, with a convincing, well thought-of script, and then, maybe, it could be saved. Another option is to watch it mute. Till then, do your soul a favor, and keep your distance."
21,Kubo and the Two Strings,,23 February 2017,"If you must blink, do it now","In one of the most ""meta"" cinematic confessions of the last years since Kylo Ren being embarrassed by his inability to live up to Darth Vader in Episode VII, young wizard/storyteller Kubo (Art Parkinson), the titular protagonist here, sheepishly admits he isn't very good with endings.This stop-motion fantasy adventure by Laika (Coraline, ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls) has many successful elements: likable characters, strong voice acting (Charlize Theron in particular is great as a talking animal companion), enough original spins to make the classic hero's journey feel fresh ... and it looks phenomenal. Kubo bristles with visual details - it's one of the most gorgeous animated movies I've watched in years.Spoilers aside, Kubo starts with an effective first act, builds up to a powerful crescendo... then sort of peters out at the end. Characters we've grown attached to get kicked off the spotlight by the main villain, who had been conspicuously absent until then. It's not a *bad* conclusion - it has a nice bittersweet flavor - but it's anticlimactic. It's the opposite of ParaNorman, which was droll but unremarkable for most of its running time but knocked it out of the park in the final act.Overall, Laika's winning streak continues. Much like Coraline, however, this isn't fit for younger children - if you want a fine stop-motion adventure for little kids, go for the Shaun the Sheep movie.7.5/10"
22,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,26 November 2016,beautiful movie let down by bad storytelling,"I'll come right out and say it, Kubo and the Two Strings is the best looking movie of the year. In fact, it might be the most visually impressive animated film ever made. The action scenes are exciting, the character designs are unique, and overall the scale and scope of the stop-motion is insane. Considering this movie was a box office flop we will probably never see stop-motion animation of this caliber ever again. The story though is just garbage. It tries way too hard to be funny. Way way way too hard. I can't lie, I didn't laugh a single time throughout this whole movie, and I'm not exactly the hardest person to make laugh. I can't imagine I am the only person who felt this way either. Beetle might be the worst comedic relief character I have seen in a film in a long time, and him being voiced by alright alright alright Matthew Mcconaughey, whose voice doesn't match the character he is voicing at all. Monkey is also a really weak character, and her relationship with beetle is one of the most unbelievable and forced friendships in an animated film this year. It's sad really, because this movie starts out with such a harsh and depressing tone rarely seen in kids movies, yet it slowly devolves into pure clichéd and unfunny (for lack of a better word) crap. Still, the action scenes as well as the quality of the animation and excellent sound design make this movie worth the watch. 7/10"
23,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,5 February 2017,Beautiful Technique Hampered By An Awful Story,"A young boy named Kubo must locate a magical suit of armor worn by his late father in order to defeat a vengeful spirit from the past.For Best Animated Film of 2016, there seems to be two schools of thought: either ""Zootopia"" or ""Kubo"". The former has so far been winning the most awards, and will probably win the Oscar. But ""Kubo"" has a strong following, with some saying it is not only the best animated film, but one of the best films of the year in any genre.I love a good underdog, but in this case my sympathies lie with ""Zootopia"". The creators there have crafted an entire world, and it is not only very enjoyable, but lends itself to any number of sequels with other characters. It is a rich, dense landscape. ""Kubo"", on the other hand, is a very shallow, one-dimensional story. A boy goes looking for armor, and without even knowing what direction to go, he stumbles over it almost immediately. There is no deep conception of character or plot, everything just falls into place. For me, that really makes the film lacking and does not make me want to take repeat trips.However, ""Kubo"" is also nominated for Best Visual Effects. And on that note, I would love to see it win. I don't personally know the challenges of traditional animation versus computer animation versus stop motion. But, I do see the finished product here and how flawless it looks. Unlike the ""classic"" stop motion (such as ""King Kong""), the movements are seamless. I can't even fathom the amount of minuscule adjustments that have to be made.Although ""Zootopia"" is a clear favorite for Best Animated Feature (in my opinion), by all means give ""Kubo"" the Best Visual Effects and honor these folks for the hard work and countless hours it must have taken."
24,Kubo and the Two Strings,,20 August 2016,"Thrilling, moving, and so beautifully crafted","Stop-Motion animation can be a thing of pure beauty. I've been a fan of Laika's previous films (particularly Coraline and ParaNorman to a great extent), and so I really was excited for this. Based on the trailers, it looked like a dazzling experience and I was sure that it would not fail to meet expectations. I was right. There's a real sense of artistry to the film that is missing in a lot of other kids' animated films. It's about family, the power of memory, and longing, and it manages to create some truly memorable, fantastic villains that happen to be both well-written and really terrifying. More than anything, the themes at its core really resonate. This may likely be the best animated film of the year."
25,Kubo and the Two Strings,5,5 February 2017,Boring movie,"I pushed myself hard to finish watching this movie and finally watched it with a break. The main reason behind this is the bad story telling technique. The plot is not defined and the story failed to hold my interest. There are much unnecessary dialogue and scenes which don't add any value to the story. The most important thing is that the protagonist is out for its quest which is also not defined. I felt no empathy for the protagonist. Not a single character in this movie is well developed. There is no background story for them. Thus the purpose of the characters is unknown. As a viewer, I did not connect with the characters at all. The ending is also vague, and I doubt if kids will understand it at all. There is nothing good about the story. The animators did a fair job, and the animation could have been better (keeping ParaNorman 2012 as a benchmark)"
26,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,12 November 2016,Not for real anime/Asian-movie lovers,"It's a half assed western style remake which takes everything from the east without any respect.Initially I had high hopes, but this movie betrays its origins on such a deep level. If you're not a real fan of anime or Asian movies (esp. Japan) you will not be disappointed, as Kubo takes you on a visually stunning ride with two mildly interesting characters. If you are a real fan, you will know what I'm talking about.Depth or character development don't even come close to what this movie could be. This is just a superficial, slow paced where it should be fast, fast where it should be slow, abruptly-ended and the worst ending battle in modern history.6/10"
27,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,15 August 2016,Amazing animation,"The animation/stop-motion on this movie was amazing. The visuals are great, the voice acting is top notch and the sequences of action are top notch as well. My one complaint about the movie and the reason it dragged my score down a little was because the overall plot was a bit...muddled. I won't go into why I think that because I don't want to give anything away, but I will say I wasn't the only one at the screening who felt the same way.The only other thing I would point out is that this MAY not be a great film to take younger (5 - 8 years old) children to, I could see some of the sequences being a bit frightening for them, but, as an adult I really liked how dark some of it was.Overall the film was really good and I would definitely recommend seeing it."
28,Kubo and the Two Strings,5,22 August 2016,Animation certainly isn't sufficient for a good movie,"I had certainly increased expectations with this movie since my benchmark had elevated after watching previous animations like ""Inside out"" and ""Zootopia"". Kubo with two strings, unfortunately, was a big disappointment.The movie has a weak story line with an average animation. Story: The weak script fails to impress the audience of any age. Story is poorly defined and weakly executed. While one will keep waiting for the story to grow deeper and reveal any more suspense, the story actually becomes very direct and unveils itself in very early part of the movie. It's just another fantasy, without any strong take home message. This is very unlike the movies like Zootopia and Inside out which were entertaining, attention-grabbing and communicated a strong message. Animation : Animation is average. Doesn't score much over Inside Out/ Zootopia. I watched the movie in 2D. The only thing which created excitement was the magical origami. The floating papers assuming different shapes based on the imagination of Kubo was certainly a treat to the eye and I am sure would be spectacular when watched in 3D. Certainly; just animation is not sufficient. A weak story line and poor story telling is what makes this movie a no-no to watch."
29,Kubo and the Two Strings,3,16 February 2017,Accomplishes some incredibly rare feats (though none of them good),"I don't need to post any spoilers for this movie for one simple reason: It is predictable to the 11th power.Which says a lot, because a good chunk of the movie's plot is pushed forward with deus ex machina and characters just popping up right the frig out of nowhere to join our hero. But you will know what the ""big reveal"" about every single one of these characters (which are all stock, BTW -- only the monkey ever proved even MILDLY amusing) the very second they are introduced.This movie, therefore, accomplishes the incredibly rare feat of relying on stupid random crap while still managing to be boring and predictable.So if not for this movie's ""plot"", the love for it must be due to its breathtaking stop motion animation, right? Well. . . Sure, I could believe that. Because the people at Laika have succeeded at pushing the limits of stop motion so far that it can easily be mistaken for CG.Really bad, really cheap, Norm of the North-like CG.Bottom line: Unless you're an art snob or keen on pretending to be one, this movie is not for you. It is stupid, dull and ugly to view, and ultimately will only suffice to make you angry at all the people who swore you needed to watch it."
30,Kubo and the Two Strings,3,12 January 2017,"Gorgeous animation, dull story and a bit over-hyped","Initially I had no intention of watching this movie as there was nothing really screaming ""you must watch this movie"" to me but I had it on while in college one day and I can definitely say it was maybe a bit too over-hyped. Now I will say the animation is stunning, seeing how they created and animated the giant monster they battle was amazing and aside from the character played by Matthew McConaughey who was quite funny the story fell flat and the characters weren't all that likable to me, Kubo came off as bratty and the monkey was just irritating. This movie is called the greatest animated movie of 2016 but I'm sorry to say I do prefer Zootropolis and Finding Dory over this one, they had deep emotional stories whereas I think of lot of people didn't make it past the animation aspect of Kubo which for me is the only reason the movie isn't scored lower."
31,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,19 August 2016,Is Laika the foil to Aardman?,"I should start this review by revealing that when I was younger, my family absolutely loved Aardman and their stop-motion comedies, especially Chicken Run and The Curse of the Were- Rabbit. I need to see them again at some point, as back when I was at the age when we still watched them, I considered them nothing special. After seeing Kubo and the Two Strings, I have revamped interest in stop-motion animated pictures, especially Laika's other works. While Aardman represents a light-hearted comic style, Laika represents the high-action, complex, dramatic style, and nowhere is that more apparent than here. I was so amazed and scared at a decent amount of the effects the animation gave out (I didn't see the 3D version), and for stop- motion, the way everything moves is so fluid (despite some expected choppy parts) that anyone who hasn't looked into this film might think of it as CGI. While the writing makes some mistakes with the placement of its humor, it is still quite hilarious and offers a lot of epic and moving scenes. Each of the characters bring this to light, being outstandingly developed and being just what they should be, if not a tad more. Kubo and the Two Strings is, by far, among the strongest non-Disney animated movies I have seen, and should not be missed by anyone who likes animation."
32,Kubo and the Two Strings,,27 August 2016,Gently Weeps,"This film hit a sweet spot for me. It merges essential Shintoism, magic and origami in a story about storytelling, four subjects of deep interest for me. This is orgasmic level engagement, this mix. I need to see it again in 3D to see if it improves. This would have been the very rare modern film actually photographed in 3D.Some other elements could have distracted: the very western idea of a quest gives enough script to fill the time. The style of animation has bodies and motion more realistic than faces; in another context this would matter but here we are in a paper world. The use of traditional Japanese villains and characters from myths requires knowledge even I lacked. The style of animation requires a relatively stationary camera which seems inadequate, even in a Japanese context.The writing is superb, surpassing Pixar and achieving a level completely unexpected. This is true in lines: ""blink now;"" in the way things unfold unexpectedly and in the nesting of stories. Oh, the overlapping nesting! We have stories within that tell enclosing stories. We have recalled and invented stories cogenerating. The main combat is between/among stories. Memory and stories are bound in an unusual way. So many events unfold in novel ways. This is all the more impressive when you consider the inflexible manner of production. You cannot iterate and reshoot like you can with computers or eve actors. What you see is largely what they started with years before even they saw it. If just for the writing, see this movie.The effects were interestingly different, and by themselves would perhaps have underwhelmed. But the story context by the time things got active added enough. Effects early in the movie have magically folded characters animated by the stories within the story and these were amazing.I am not seeing many films these days, so it is profound luck that my 3 and 5 year olds took me into this.And... the credits roll over the George Harrison song that very few understand in its role in the White Album. Here it isn't just used with this knowledge, it is rendered so by a woman I never heard of."
33,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,19 August 2016,Great Show,"My favorite part is the 2 sisters. I like them because of how emotionally creepy they were. They appeared in the background and wore masks. The masks really made them cool. I liked how her voice echoed behind the mask.I was actually emotionally disturbed about the parents. The mother seemed like she was wasting away anyway. I was creeped out when I found out the monkey was the mother all along. The father seemed like a lost cause.I actually liked the part of the ending where the grandpa was knocked out and didn't know what just happened. He seemed like a good guy. I think Asians tend to go crazy like that. It's really creepy. A lady at church is gone who I liked but who was bothering me once, when I left and moved somewhere else.I liked a lot of the animation, like the eyeballs under the sea being so cute and funny.It was neat after the credits seeing them make the big skeleton and seeing the cool artists at work. That one guy at the end was really cute!I think the ""only"" really interesting thing for most of us was the sisters and probably because they were magic, ultimately as the best part. The whole show was still good as is, but I cherish this piece of this show, as I do that when I move on from show to show sometimes.It was also moving/touching to see the ancient Japanese ancestors and the Japanese culture as what they showed."
34,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,22 August 2016,A very good movie held back a bit by flaws,"This movie looks stunning. There, got the great blatantly obvious part out of the way. Let's move on.While I thought the movie was in every way good, there were a few flaws that held it back from being my fav of the year so far. Mind you, outside of these 2 flaws I'm about to get into, the movie was great. The plot, the action, the animation (I said it before but it bears repeating. Best animation of the year so far!), it was quite the enjoyable movie. But no movie is without flaws, and in this case... these flaws are noticeable.It was PREDICTABLE. SO VERY, VERY PREDICTABLE. I heard one line of dialogue and immediately guessed the next, and was practically word for word on many occasions. There was a moment of predictable-ness that stood out for me (SPOILERS AHEAD. BEWARE). Hanzo's death. It's revealed that the beetle guy is actually Kubo's father, cursed to be a beetle without memories for the rest of his days. Right after I saw that reveal (which was one of the moments I predicted), I knew he was gonna die at some point. SURPRISE SURPRISE, he gets killed in the next scene.The second issue? The ending. It's just kinda thrown in for no real reason. Kubo goes to his father and mother's grave and places a lantern, then talks for a bit about how he wants them back, even for a moment, so he can give the story a happy ending. Then the camera goes black, then pans down the river, to the edge, where Kubo and his parents in spirit form are. Then the movie ends. Now riddle me this: Was that final shot really necessary? They could have ended it with Kubo turning to the lantern and seeing it glow (in the movie it's a sign the spirits are nearby), then him smiling and walking away. It would have been so much more emotional than ""Oh the parents are there in spirit but this time it's literal! woohoo"". No. Not woohoo. Lame.It's a great movie. I recommend it. It's worth the price of admission. But the flaws present keep me from absolutely adoring it."
35,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,24 August 2016,"Kind of a disappointment, that's for sure.","'KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS': Three Stars (Out of Five)The new stop-motion animated fantasy flick, from director Travis Knight (the son of Nike co-founder Phil Knight). Knight is a debut director, who was also the lead animator on 'CORALINE', 'PARANORMAN' and 'THE BOXTROLLS'. Like all of those movies, this film was produced by the Portland animated film studio Laika Entertainment, LLC. (which Travis is the CEO of, and Phil Knight owns). This movie tells the story of a young boy, named Kubo, who must find a magical suit of armor, owned by his late father, in order to defeat the vengeful spirits of his grandfather and evil aunts. It was written by Marc Haimes, Chris Butler and Shannon Tindle; Butler and Tindle also worked on 'CORALINE' (as storyboard supervisor, and character designer), and Butler also wrote and co-directed 'PARANORMAN'. The movie features the voice talents of Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Ralph Fiennes, Rooney Mara, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and George Takei. It's received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, but that didn't stop it from bombing at the Box Office. I think it's an OK kids' flick, but it's also severely overrated. The story is set in Ancient Japan, where Kubo (Parkinson) lives with his mother (Theron); in a cave on top of a mountain. He goes into the local village, every day, to tell the residents mystical stories; using magical pieces of origami. One day Kubo stays out past sunset (which he's never supposed to do), in order to try and communicate with his deceased father; in a special ceremony. He's attacked by the spirits of his evil aunts (Mara), who can only come out at night. Kubo's mother saves him, just before she's killed, by giving the boy magical wings and sending him far away. Kubo then begins a mission to find a magical suit of armor, owned by his late father, in order to fight his evil aunts and defeat them. He finds aid from a talking monkey (also Theron), and a samurai beetle man, named Beetle (McConaughey).I love the film's visuals (like all of Knight's films) and it's creative (and pretty imaginative) story; but the movie is also extremely slow-paced and uninvolving. I was bored almost the entire time I was watching it. The comedy isn't funny, and I just didn't care enough about the characters (or story) to stay with it (although I had to). I got really sleepy while watching this movie, as a result. The voice actors are good, and fun to hear, but it's also pretty offensive; that it's almost all white American actors, playing Asian parts. The movie is kind of a disappointment, that's for sure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoRwrYi1UcY"
36,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,12 January 2017,Overrated,"I had high expectations for this film with all the praise it got but in the end, it fell short. Now, visually the film is gorgeous and the animation is top-notch, if you were to judge the film by those aspects, it's easily 8-9 out of 10, but there's the plot unfortunately which is just as important and happens to be paper-thin in this film. The set up for the story is extremely cliché just like many other things along with bland, poorly explained origin. And for an adventure movie, there really isn't much of it there. Let me elaborate, the main character needs to acquire 3 essential items to battle the evil forces but the angle is just so cheaply performed. They just battle a giant skeleton and then built a boat to get to their destination, that's it. And the final battle in the film just happens so arbitrarily as if the writers knew that there was nothing else to do and it's just as anticlimactic as the ending. Overall, it's safe to say that the movie was RUSHED it set up for more than it could depict. The supposed ""twist"" about Kubo's parents was extremely predictable and I don't know if it was intentional or not, but it was extremely easy to figure out right from the start of the journey. My main problem still happens to be with the movie's poorly explained background but I don't think I can elaborate on it without spoiling too much so I'll leave it at that. The main villain's motivations are pretty unconvincing and extremely shallow. Now, for the good part. Aside from excellent animation, the voice acting was really good and I enjoyed the character development as scarce as it was. But that's all there is to it. A paper-thin, uninteresting plot in a good format. 6/10 and that's generous."
37,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,2 December 2016,Visually Brilliant with some Missed Oppertunities,"I went to see 'Kubo and the Two Strings' and I really thought I'd stumbled onto something pretty great. The whole experience played like a dream. Everything about it let me shut down and just gawk. I thought ""It's a children's film, don't expect a complicated plot"". The visuals were astonishing. In the process, I kind of let my cinematic guard down.Cracks began appearing as the days rolled by. For example, the plot is incredibly simple. It starts out very strong. I found myself struggling to recall that this was stop-motion (for the most part). The strength continued with a dynamic humour between Kubo and the monkey. It was very charming. This kind of humour was disintegrated when the Beetle's comic relief penetrated the scene. I do mean to use the word penetrated, since it felt like the second most forced thing on screen. The most forced was the ending. The battle was far less interesting then the visual eye-candy of the others, and it's resolution was extremely dissatisfying. These two problems were noticeable upon first viewing. I later came to realize that, apart from the flaws, I'm disappointed by the missed opportunity of the film. If the story were on-par with the animation, we'd possibly be dealing with the greatest children's film of all time. It is genuinely the most visually stunning. Unfortunately, it lacks on the story front.Despite the issues I have, I'd still recommend the film. It's a worth-while experience. It's not one of the year's best films, but I'd put it in the recommended section. It's gorgeous to look at, and no worse of a story then most kids' movies. 8/10."
38,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,12 November 2016,"A feast for the eyes, a famine for the soul.","The visuals are gorgeous, the best hand made animation i have seen to date BUT Everything else Not so good looking i am afraid. The dialogue is heavy and clunky The characters are stereotypical and mostly flat, any development is brushed aside in favor of the setpeices, which while gorgeous cannot carry a animated movie alone The Generic script really drags the movie down and most of the voice actors talent is wasted on exposition heavy lines and clichés Such a shame Laika cant quite get their storytelling as good as their artistic style because this movie is absolutely drop dead stunningly amazing to look at. Anyone else feel the same way? I just feel it really wasn't fleshed out fully in terms of what should have been done, the ending was and most of the screen time was focused on everything but character development. To put things in perspective Coraline, while visually dated has a 10/10 story and even weaker movies like Kung Fu Panda 1 and Mulan have a much more stable and cohesive"
39,Kubo and the Two Strings,,13 June 2017,"Beautiful, though the story has its problems","Kubo and the Two Strings is the fourth film from Laika, the studio behind the excellent adaptation of Neil Gaiman's Coraline. In this new all-original story we follow young Kubo as he has to flee from mythical hunters who are after him and his mother's bloodline. For it turns out that his mother is an heiress of the kingdom of the moon and now his grandfather wants him back.Kubo is a 3D stop-motion film and the craftsmanship that went into making it is simply stunning. It looks gorgeous, especially after you realize that most things seen in it are actually there. They, for example, built a giant five meter tall skeleton puppet to play a giant skeletal monster in the film. The art design is also very pleasing, sort of a fantasy samurai world with bright colours and clean designs that reveal intricate textures when you look closer.What really keeps this film from being a great film is unfortunately the story. It's far from being awful and has some genuinely good moments, but it feels more like a myth than a modern story. And not in a good way. The pacing is very much like from a fairytale, but the dialogue, for example, is very modern, which creates a dissonance.Still, the myth-like quality works very well in creating a mood and I can imagine that there are those that find the pacing charming and delightfully different from the norm. Personally I didn't care for it, but I can admire the ambition behind it.And that's Kubo. An admirable movie in many ways and definitely worth a watch for all those looking for craftsmanship."
40,Kubo and the Two Strings,4,21 August 2016,Predictable and meh,"Saddened by not going to the fair with anyone, my mom suggested me to see Kubo with my grandpa (he was the one that was going to take me to the fair), a movie that I have been eager to see since I first heard of it. Hoping that it would cheer me up and entertain me, it ended up being slow and quite boring.While on the surface, it looks like it could be a cool story and great film, it just focuses too much on the story than developing the characters. While there were some developments, the story was still quite predictable and the action sequences, especially in the third act were nothing new.Of course Kubo is a grounded character who plays the banjo with a few strings and the movie is quieter than most action-fantasy films. I am not a huge fan of action, though, so this one didn't entertain me as much as other action films such as ""Zootopia"".The animation, on the other hand, was mostly exceptional. I liked the design of the moon king dragon and the movements of the characters. Though, it may have been a bit rushed but still wonderful. The mid-credits scene, where the animators were moving the giant skeleton in this room was real awesome and I wanted to see in real life how Laika makes their movies.Overall, Kubo while being slightly better in storytelling and entertainment department, deserves a spot next to ""The Boxtrolls"" as one of Laika's weaker films. Paranorman is still the best Laika film and Coraline is better. Though, I'm still waiting for what other great films Laika has in store for us."
41,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,21 August 2016,A masterful stop-motion film for kids and adults alike,"Okay, here's the problem with writing about Kubo and the Two Strings: a lot  and I do mean A LOT  of what I need to point out might or might not slip me to spoiler territory. Sucks, I know, but not doing so would not give this movie justice. So what I'm about to do is explain the story, explain the surface level stuff, and leave the deeper material later on. Deal?In either case, yes, you've heard it right; Kubo and the Two Strings is a masterpiece. After almost a decade of major studios like DreamWorks, Disney, and Illumination trotting out safe, eye-appealing kid's movies, the small Claymation studio Laika returns once again with yet another masterwork. It's a film that exceeds more than just their use of performances and impressive visual style with their usual somber aesthetic and shockingly relatable fables. This time, they finally step out of their usual Gothic horror design and focus more on a Miyazaki- inspired Eastern palette. The result might finally replace their previous film ParaNorman as their definitive peak of their abilities, and probably be the best stop-motion movie ever made since Nightmare Before Christmas.Borrowing wholesale from Asian folklore, the story takes place in Ancient Japan where a one-eyed child by the name Kubo lives in a desolate mountain with his grief-stricken mother. During his downtime, he travels to a nearby village to perform origami tricks with his magic guitar (which is so amazing you won't even question it) , which he uses to tell an ancient story about his father - a legendary samurai - who was the first to square up against the Moon King with the aid of three pieces of golden armor (sword, helmet, and breastplate) . But after disobeying his mother for not staying home after dark, he soon encounters the Evil Sister who are in cahoots with the Moon King and decides to mess things up in the village and take Kubo away in the process. The mother, reawaken from her grief, defends Kubo with her last of her powers in an attempt to fend off her foes. In the aftermath, Kubo now must find the three pieces and make things right while fending off the Moon King and his cohorts. Along the journey, he encounters a stern, assertive Monkey (Charlize Theron) and a brave but dense warrior Beetle (Matthew McConaughey).So, no guesses for which this story will wrap up in the end, or even how the inevitable plot twist will turn up. However, like Laika always promises, there's real depth and a fresh new take on this material amongst their visual flair.SPOILERS!!! You see, the whole film is pretty much a parable for a broken/dysfunctional family scenario integrated into an epic fetch quest storyline. Kubo's mother is scarred by the Moon King who happens to be Kubo's grumpy grandfather (Ralph Fiennes). When she wouldn't comply to join his world  the world free of mortal consequence and pain  he punishes her by killing her mate and damaging Kubo's left eye. So really, the whole clichéd epic story where the hero fights a villain to save the kingdom actually has some resonance because they twisted it into a psychological trial of fixing a broken family. It's even right down to having the two companions (You read the spoiler warning!!) be the reincarnated versions of Kubo's parents guiding Kubo to find the right tools to fend off old Grandpas' evildoings and bring him away from his evil. It's the type of story that can also relate to both young kids and adults alike, which is a type of feat we seldom see these days.Now granted, the twist with Beetle and Monkey seems fairly obvious right from the get-go, with them possessing typical mother-and-father traits. However, it seems like it's the point like it almost comes with the supply of Kubo engaging in a trial for finding his courage and family connection up until the big boss fight.Even if any young mind wouldn't capture all the subtext, they're probably too busy gushing over the widely impressive stop-motion animation. Even for a guy who never really get all impressed with stop- motion, I was in awe with what Laika has done here. With subtle feats like face details and clothing/hair physics to grand moments like the varied and large-scale boss fights, I'm glad this type of animation came quite a long way. What also amazes me lies in the remarkably detailed Eastern setting bursting with color and homage. For an animation company coming from the origins of the classic Harryhausen days, it's simply astonishing for how far their hard work exceeds this medium.The performances are too good to dismiss. Mathew McConaughey shows his usual charming swagger in Beetle while also pulling off his shortsighted aspects. Charlize Theron once again gives her best as a stern Monkey. Ralph Fiennes almost disappears in his role as the intimidating yet entirely nuanced villain the Moon King. Rooney Mara also impresses as the Sinister Twins, who mostly sounds reminiscent of the Twins from The Shining. The standout, though, is Game of Thrones own Art Parkinson utilizes impressive range as Kubo, invoking both the vulnerable and the courageous aspects of his character.By now, you probably guessed that this is my new favorite movie. There's virtually nothing hampering the movie nor any one element overwhelming another. As a kids film, it's pretty much perfect. As a warm diversion for the adults, it still works considerably. The type of film that relates to kids without talking down to them. It's the type of deceptively simple storytelling that captures adult themes without falling gratuitous territory. It's the type of film that contains huge respect for Eastern folklore without wearing out its welcome. Filled with character dynamics and emotion, this is an instant classic and you need to see it!For more reviews, check out my blog: http://hydebarker.blogspot.com/"
42,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,19 August 2016,Two thumbs up for the two strings.,"It's a great story coming from stop motion animation studio, Laika.It's not the greatest story from their list of animated movies, but it's very poetic, and this creativity really makes up for it.Kubo is a kid with one eye taken from him as a baby by his grandfather, he's a story teller in his village (The story he told with his paper characters within the film is better than the story overall). Then in an attempt to make contact with his father in the after world, brings him back on his grandfather's radar who sends his aunts to get him as he goes on a journey to find his father's Armour for protection.The story was implemented so well through animation. It was so imaginative. Nothing like being shown a story rather than being told a story which is bad for animation.They really moved the characters around, and the characters are worth moving. Very artistic and colorful. I especially like Monkey, from the character design to the voice of Charlize Theron.Overall, very good looking picture.http://cinemagardens.com"
43,Kubo and the Two Strings,5,20 August 2016,Good plot but fails in storytelling and animation,"When we watched the trailer of Kubo, it didn't inspire so much. However, we thought to give it a shot after reading the IMDb rating. However, now I'm more confident of my judgment based on the trailer. Although it's less than 2 hours of a movie, we started feeling sleepy after about an hour itself.Story (5/10): Kubo is the story of a kid who is trying to find answers regarding his family history. With a mother who is slowly losing her memory, he has more questions than answers about who his father was, why they have to live in hiding, why his grandfather and aunts want to kill him and much more. While the story was good, the screenplay, or if we say the art of storytelling, is where the movie suffered and made it very boring to watch. The characters are dull. His mother is totally lost and lifeless in one scene and extremely lively in another and angry in the next, which just doesn't make sense. The chemistry between Monkey and Kubo is totally missing. While Kubo has been shown as a boy, his voice (Art Parkinson) and dialogue delivery resemble more to a girl (could have been a better idea if the protagonist was a girl).Animation (4/10): The movie reminded me of 90s animation techniques. Hollywood has moved way ahead now. The movie could have done much better with a story around magic and Samurai warriors.Direction (6/10): In his directorial debut, Travis Knight impressed in bits and pieces. To begin with, the opening scene of the movie was simply brilliant. The humor from the character of Beetle was good, which made the movie enjoyable to some extent. However, the overall storytelling wasn't up to the mark - I feel Zootopia, Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda (1st) were really good in that. Besides that, some logical mistakes (a small kid doesn't take on a giant caterpillar holding sword in just one hand) made the mockery of the character. Consistency in characterization was also missing. Overall (5/10): Overall, the movie had a very cliché but a good plot. However, it went downhill when it came to executing it. You won't miss anything in life if you don't watch this movie."
44,Kubo and the Two Strings,,23 October 2016,Obviously made by Portland hipsters; a film elitist's dream,"As usual, movies like this gets raves from critics and others who consider themselves film connoisseurs. My friend thought it was REALLY good, as did most critics and anyone who watched the film. And as usual, my issue isn't with the film itself, like the cinematography, story, or voice acting. It's with social and cultural issues underlying it. It's about Japan. Many Westerners know Japan from anime, manga, and cosplay. This film is none of that; Portland hipsters aren't really into that type of stuff. As an Asian American, many things about this film, and the cultural underpinnings that led to it, feels troublesome and uncomfortable to me. First off - the look of the Japanese characters. Why does Kubo have such strange, chunky, oil-slick sort of hair? He doesn't look anime, but his look, and well as all the other Japanese characters, is a Westerners' envisioning of an Asian. Actual Japanese artists would not make him look like that - especially not the odd, piece-y hair. Is his mom supposed to be considered a beauty? Real Japanese people would not draw/create attractive Japanese women like that. I know that Portlanders and other liberal Americans LOVE Japanese culture - while looking down on and under-appreciating some other major Asian cultures that have contributed greatly to the world over the centuries. There are so many painful things about American films, one review can't begin to do justice. This definitely will cause the world (ok, film buffs in the US) to have a different and more open- minded view of Japan. Few of us know that it's full of gorgeous forests, outdoor beauty, and supposedly some supernatural sort of mythology. I'm not Japanese, and it opened my eyes to that - supposedly. I assumed that Kubo was based on some Japanese folktale, but it's not. I searched the web and could find no evidence for this. It seems the filmmakers were inspired by Japan in some way, and set about making a film on it, in the elitist hopes of ""diversity."" The film is definitely an Americans' fantasy, though. I doubt much of it is accurate. Can any Japanese weigh in on this?Most films are just very unsettling to me. Kubo is actually pretty whitewashed; the way Kubo and the others talk, act, and think sound like white people. It isn't how Japanese or Asians act or think. It's not very culturally Japanese or Asian, other than taking place there, and having superficial Japanese elements like origami. It's definitely a Westerners' envisioning of Japan, and again, probably not very accurate. Movies are very influential, so that can mislead very large numbers of people with wrong information. Like so much of my everyday life, it's like white people trying to obliterate another culture, practically make it white, and dream up the elements in their own way. My friend LOVED Kubo, but being non-Asian, he didn't find any of it painful or unsettling. He REALLY enjoyed seeing the ""Asian"" people in the movie - white people's stereotypes of what Asians should look like. Many people are Japan buffs, and non-Asians who like Asian culture would find a lot to like about this film. Just remember it's a total fantasy created by Portlanders, with very little accuracy in anything. On the bright side, the film is visually stunning. I adored certain scenes, like the floating lanterns in the river, the guy who turned into a lighted-up dragon, and the stars in the cabin while Kubo was playing his instrument. This type of intelligent-yet-entertaining film is every film geek's dream, so I'm sure it's an Academy Award contender for Best Animated Film, Best Cinematography, etc. In fact, it might even win Best Animated Film. Dumber animated films like Zootopia aren't really trying to prove anything, like Kubo is. At least Zootopia was unpretentious, just a silly, funny family film that's not trying to be much. Kubo definitely reflects the state of filmmaking, the type of people who become filmmakers, and film buffs these days. It all feels like some sort of major subculture in the US. These are the people who are driving the culture these days. They need to be careful because whatever they're putting out there is very influential and will affect the perception of the masses.I'm wavering between a 6 and a 7 on this film. My ratings tend to seem high compared to the criticisms in my review, but I go with whatever number feels right to me. It's an excellent film in terms of cinematography and animation, and the story is more sophisticated than most. But all the sociocultural crap is painful, and it's really a reflection of Americans and how they view Asians and other cultures. This film reminds me of the almost patronizing vibe of a similar progressive Americans' film - Mira Nair's ""Queen of Katwa."" So much of filmmaking these days, and film fests, and those who claim to be film buffs, reflect this whole ""diversity""-loving but patronizing progressive subculture. That's actually a dominant culture in the US and the West, not exactly a subculture, at least when it comes to artsy stuff like films."

This type of intelligent-yet-entertaining film is every film geek's dream, so I'm sure it's an Academy Award contender for Best Animated Film, Best Cinematography, etc. In fact, it might even win Best Animated Film. Dumber animated films like Zootopia aren't really trying to prove anything, like Kubo is. At least Zootopia was unpretentious, just a silly, funny family film that's not trying to be much. Kubo definitely reflects the state of filmmaking, the type of people who become filmmakers, and film buffs these days. It all feels like some sort of major subculture in the US. These are the people who are driving the culture these days. They need to be careful because whatever they're putting out there is very influential and will affect the perception of the masses.My ratings tend to seem high compared to the criticisms in my review, but I go with whatever number feels right to me. It's an excellent film in terms of cinematography and animation, and the story is more sophisticated than most. But all the sociocultural crap is painful, and it's really a refection of Americans and how they view Asians and other cultures. This film reminds me of the almost patronizing vibe of a similar progressive Americans' film - Mira Nair's ""Queen of Katwa."" So much of filmmaking these days, and film fests, and those who claim to be film buffs, reflect this whole ""diversity""-loving but patronizing progressive subculture. That's actually a dominant culture in the US and the West, not exactly a subculture, at least when it comes to artsy stuff like films."
46,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,16 January 2018,Three minutes into this movie I had shivers,"I have always been a fan of the stories Studio Laika chooses to tell, but I have often found they fall just a little short of actually hitting all the right emotional responses in dramatic scenes. In Kubo and the Two Strings there was so much emotion I almost forgot to breath. A boy that loves to tell stories must go on to make it through his own, though the cruel dangers he faces spares no one. Absolutely beautiful (but so incredibly sad) story about family."
47,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,12 January 2018,It's Not That Great,"Let me start out by saying I thought this movie was okay. It got great reviews, and I really don't understand it. It's not like a movie like Sing where the only reason it got decent reviews was because it was inoffensive and ""relatable"", but it still is over-hyped.However, I must admit the animation is breathtaking. Clear effort was thrown into making this movie as stunning as possible, and it was worth it. It takes much effort for this kind of animation to look this good, and it payed off.However, where this film runs into its problems is the script. The script for this film has some creative ideas and I feel there is something great that you can make from this, but it feels lazy and underdeveloped. I didn't care for Kubo at all. I thought he was a bland, very ""meh"" character. He had a good motivation for what he was doing, but I didn't feel anything for him. The same can be said about the other two main characters, Beetle and Monkey. They each have their moments of charisma and likability, but they take them in a very predictable and bland direction that I was honestly frustrated by.So this is the definition of an over-hyped film. I think it got this level of great reviews because of the studio not being Disney and it having a great concept. Other than that, I don't understand the praise. It has sparks of potential and some terrific moments, but it overall comes off as an everyday forgettable movie. It's on Netflix, so if you're curious, check it out, but don't expect anything too great."
48,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,2 January 2018,A fun and unique adventure,"'Kubo & The Two Strings' is a stop-motion animation film set in ancient Japan - and it's superb. Kubo (Parkinson) is a young, one-eyed boy who lives outside a small town and tells stories with origami characters that come to 'life' when he plays his guitar - this is amazing to watch and expertly done. When he finds out his Grandfather is the Moon King (Finnes) who wants to steal his remaining eye, he sets out on a quest to find the mystic armour.He's helped by Monkey (Theron), his guardian, & Beetle (McConaughey) a samurai man-sized rhinoceros-beetle - Beetle has the best lines and quips in the film and really adds to the adventure. PG is right - I'm not sure I'd let a child under 8 see this, due to some of the darker scenes and it does deal a fair bit with death and spirits (the 'sisters' (Mara) are particularly scary!). This studio, Laika, is on a roll ('Coraline', 'ParaNorman' and 'The Boxtrolls' - all good), and with 'Kubo', they're starting to give Pixar a run for their money!The plot is essentially predictable, but it's the heart the actors and animators infuse the characters with that makes this film stand out. It looks stunning and there's plenty of imaginative and original things that pop-up throughout. Highly recommended."
49,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,27 December 2017,A welcome addition to the crowded animated genre,"Every month seems to bring another big budget animated film. I just wish all of them were this beautiful and original. Yes, Kubo finds adventure and laughter, but - more importantly - his journey surprises at every turn. From the moment you first see origami dancing, you know that this movie will be unique. And the happiness you find along the way is richer because it's tinged with a grief that rings true."
50,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,18 October 2017,"Stunning visuals, weak story!","Warning: this review contains many spoilers!I was so excited to watch this movie after reading the many many very positive reviews but I felt disappointed after doing that. Visually the movie is a masterpiece but I think the unoriginal story and plot holes ruined it. The story seems Dragon Quest IV, there's a boy (a little bard who plays an old guitar-like instrument) which must destroy a monster (his uncle) by collecting the pieces of a legendary armor (sword, armor and a helmet). He travels through the world with the help of his mother (incarnated inside a body of a monkey) and a weird looking scarab-human warrior (he's his dad but, trust me, it took me few seconds to figure out it was his father). So they found the magic sword stuck inside a huge living monster head (but if the sword is so powerful then why it's stuck inside a monster head and the monster doesn't die?). They found the armor under the sea (just how did it get down there?) and the helmet which was widely exposed, you won't believe this... outside Kubo's village (so the legendary helmet was in Kubo's village all the time and no one noticed that?). Meanwhile Kubo's mom and dad die while protecting him from the two evil sisters and Kubo faces his evil uncle in the final battle. In the end Kubo defeats his uncle by playing his guitar with a string of his mom hair, a string of his hair and the string of his father's bow. So the journey in search of the legendary artifacts was...completely pointless (he could play the guitar with the strings way before and his mom and dad would be still alive). Kubo's uncle turns into a nice guy (I don't know how) and the movie ends. Final score 7/10.Kubo and the two string is a good movie. It has stunning visuals, great graphics, memorable characters and good dialogues but it would be a true masterpiece if wasn't for its unoriginal story and plot holes. Overall the movie is a bit overrated but I can recommend it to everyone."
51,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,5 October 2017,A delightful animated myth from Studio Laika,"In the opening scenes a woman crosses a sea in a small boat with her small, one eyed child. As they reach land she is injured when she hits her head on a rock. Years pass and she is clearly unwell thanks to her injury. The child, Kubo, is now twelve and looks after her. He earns money telling stories which are magically animated by origami characters as he plays a shamisen. One story in particular tells of a samurai who confronted the Moon King little does he know but the story isn't as mythical as he thought. His mother warned him that he must always be home before the sun sets or his grandfather will find him and take his remaining eye.Inevitably one day he stays out too late is confronted by his two aunts who intend to take him to his grandfather and his mother helps him flee. When he wakens he is in a snow-covered landscape with a talking snow monkey, which claims to be the charm he carried given life by his mother's magic. If he is to survive unharmed they will have to find three magical items; a sword, breastplate and a helmet. On their way they meet 'Beetle', a samurai who has had his memory taken and been turned into an anthropomorphic stag beetle; he joins them in their quest. As they travel on their quest they must face various threats, including his aunts, before Kubo must ultimately face his grandfather.As with other films from Studio Laika there is a darkness about this animation. The opening scene gives a hint of this as we see blood when Kubo's mother bashes her head; then there is the fact that Kubo's grandfather has taken one of his eyes and plans to take the other with this and 'Coroline' Laika clearly have a thing about taking children's eyes! This doesn't mean it is a bad film, far from it, but it might not be suitable for younger children.I really enjoyed this film; the animation is fantastic and the story is a lot of fun. There are some nice little surprises along the way. The central characters are a lot of fun with Monkey and Beetle providing plenty of laughs as well as poignant moments they certainly aren't just comedy sidekicks. There are lots of creative flourishes; I loved the way the origami animated Kubo's stories and later he used leaves in a similar way to make a boat. The voice cast, which includes plenty of familiar names does a fine job, playing the characters straight rather than getting too hammy. Overall I'd definitely recommend this; especially to anybody who enjoyed Laika's previous films."
52,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,2 October 2017,Four words. I love you....monkey.,"The story is a cosmic myth. Kubo and his mother escape and hide from her sisters and father who took his eye. They live in a cave and do not go out at night. Kubo is a street performer who utilizes magic and origami to tell long tales. With an ailing mother, Kubo wonders out and the epic story begins as a quest for a sword, shield, and helmet. His companions are a monkey and a beetle. I found the story to be delightful and funny. Charlize Theron as Monkey and Matthew McConaughey as Beetle did great character voices with well written lines."
53,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,13 September 2017,"An affectionate, yet melancholy tribute to the Eastern influences on Western animation","Kubo and the Two Strings is an animated stop-motion film by animation studio LAIKA (Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls). Featuring the voices of Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, and Ralph Fiennes, it is a well-made Western adventure film with a distinct Eastern vibe.In ancient Japan, a young eye-patched boy named Kubo lives in a cave caring for his sick mother. To make a living, Kubo travels down to his local village to perform with his shamisen (a three-stringed instrument), which he uses to magically manipulate origami paper into a story about the legendary samurai warrior Hanzo, his deceased father. One day, Kubo is eventually found by his wicked aunts who are working to bring him to the Moon King, who is responsible for killing Hanzo. After escaping, Kubo then journeys to find the missing pieces of Hanzo's armour and defeat the Moon King once and for all.Featuring beautiful visual effects and a clever story told in the style reminiscent of a Japanese fable, Kubo and the Two Strings is an affectionate, yet melancholy tribute to the Eastern influences on Western animation. The stop-motion look makes the effort and care put into the making of the film seem all the more powerful and impactful. In terms of action, the film has some great sword-fight scenes, almost in the vein of Akira Kurosawa's samurai films, but some moments may be too intense for very young audiences. The voice acting is solid, especially from Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey. However, I feel that it is Art Parkinson who stands out the most as Kubo, he holds the film with perfect composure without ever making his character seem annoying or bratty.I rate it 8/10"
54,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,7 September 2017,Beautiful and Ambitious - Laika's Best,"In recent years Laika has been developing a flawless reputation, similar to what Pixar use to have and their latest film is easily their best (or at least able to rival Coraline).In a small village in a world similar to Medieval Japan Kubo (Art Parkinson) is a young boy who tells stories for money during the day and cares for his mother at night. However, it turns out the stories that Kubo that were true and he is being hunted by The Moon King and his mother's sisters (Rooney Mara).Compared to other Western animation studios Laika are darker with its storytelling and imaginary and Kubo and the Two Strings continues that trend. The sisters are a wonderfully creepy creation because of the masks they wear and Mara's manipulated voice.As well having the best features of other Laika films Kubo and the Two Strings also works within the Disney and Pixar templates. Kubo is a fantasy story in the vein of recent Disney efforts like Tangled and Moana and gives audiences some great action set-pieces. Whilst like Pixar Kubo has the heart and some of the themes would have fitted in a Pixar film - Kubo's first scene was him caring for his mother who was in a vegetative state. It's the type of scene that could have fitted in the opening of a Pixar film - Wall-E and Up even did that.Throughout the film there is a thematic throughline of what makes a family with Kubo having to find out what makes a family as well as care for his mother. There is also a theme the importance of memory and stories and how they are connected. It gives Kubo a lot of substance.Although Kubo does stray into dark material for a kids film it's not without moments of fun. Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey make for a great double act as Monkey and Beatle, having some great banter and there are some of big action scenes include a fight with a giant skeleton and Monkey fighting one of the sisters who uses a Kusarigama.Kubo and the Two Strings is a great film, working both as a fantasy adventure and as something deeper. It's a great offering from 2016 which itself offered some great animated films."
55,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,31 August 2017,Laika's Magnum Opus,"Where to begin in describing this wonderfully crafted, stylishly animated and emotional tale by the studio behind ""Coraline""? Laika Animation Studios outdid themselves with this Oscar nominated dramedy about a young boy, the titular Kubo, who must shield himself from his evil grandfather who intends to mold the boy into an equally cold, emotionless being. Along the way our hero is aided by a sarcastic spirit animal, Monkey, and a clueless but brave and lovable samurai known as Beetle, the trio endures numerous challenges and tragedy that will keep the heart racing, produce tears, make you laugh and warm your heart.The film assembles an all star voice that includes Rooney Mara as entities who are Kubo's aunts (his mother's sisters) that are in league with the Moon King, Kubo's grandfather, and want to capture our hero for their father's dark purpose. Mara is used sparingly, but to good effect with her girlishly evil giggle and cold vocal delivery. Also used to limited degrees is English thespian Ralph Fiennes as the evil Moon King. The actor's character is only seen at the film's conclusion, but his influence is felt throughout as he sends his wicked daughters to capture his grandson and the stories from Kubo's mother warn us how terrible the Moon King is. When Fiennes finally does appear, he plays his role with coolness, an unsettling calm but quickly flips to drastic measures to get Kubo on his side which ends up futile due to Kubo's strength and goodness.But the greatest vocal performances come from the three leading players of Kubo, Monkey and Beetle: 1. As the sarcastic yet loyal Monkey is the superb Charlize Theron. The talented actress brings the right amount of wit, charisma and care to the touchy animal who comes across as abrasive when we first meet her, but we quickly learn that Monkey just wants to protect Kubo and aid him on his journey. The character's one liners both crack us up and also pull at the heartstrings once we learn who Monkey really is which speaks volumes of Theron's abilities as a thespian. 2. Playing Monkey's hilarious foil is the dimwitted Beetle voiced to perfection by actor Matthew McConaughey. Little is known about Beetle other than what he tells our heroes when we first meet him, but with comedic flair McConaughey makes the character likable immediately. The banter between Beetle and Monkey makes for the film's best uses of humor as McConaughey's carefree attitude combating with Theron's serious purpose puts the characters at odds for the majority of the film's run-time till the two learn to work through their differences as they both care for Kubo. 3. And the all important title character of Kubo is voiced wonderfully by 'Game of Thrones' actor Art Parkinson. The young actor quickly avoids making Kubo a typical protagonist who is conceited or spoiled, but instead as a headstrong boy imbued with great talents who is yet naïve of the wide world around him. Parkinson makes Kubo's journey as well-rounded as Kubo starts off treating his purpose as a bit of a joke which annoys Monkey to no end, but as he forges onward with his companions Kubo begins to learn how to control his magical powers and become a young man. The emotional moments for the character are the defining showcases of Art Parkinson's range as an actor by varying his reactions to the characters around him to never coming across as fake when the tragic moments hit.Laced with a brilliant mix of humor and heart, the screenwriters hit us with emotional punches within the first few minutes as we learn Kubo's origin story. The film switches gears throughout the first act by blending fun whimsical imagery (perfectly captured in Kubo's story about his father that he tells the townsfolk) with sadness in seeing Kubo's mostly mute mother who does what she can to protect her beloved son since her husband, the brave samurai Hanzo, is gone; having sacrificed himself for his family's safety. The script sticks to sarcastic humor once Theron's Monkey is introduced as she and Kubo start off as opposites with her serious over-protectiveness mixed with Kubo's naivety. Once Beetle is introduced and crafted as Monkey's humorous foil with his well meaning bravery, but carefree attitude towards the journey for the magical armor the trio must find, the mood provides laughs thanks again to the hilarity of Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey's abilities to play off each other perfectly and give insight into their characters the third act where twists upon twists are uncovered and we say goodbye to some wonderful characters which will break your heart and send the tears flooding down like waterfalls.Be sure to keep the tissues ready and enjoy this wonderful animated masterpiece."
56,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,27 August 2017,Amazing stop motion animation and lovely storyline,"We watched this movie as a family and were blown away by its beautiful story line and amazing animation. Jaw dropping art direction with a wonderful soundtrack and characters that you fell in love with, immediately. Gentle yet deeply creepy in places, a true masterpiece in the world of animation. Wonderful."
57,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,17 August 2017,Kubo and the Two Strings (@cmp_moviereviews),"Full of the kind of adventure that tugs at my inner kids heartstrings, ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is a beautifully rendered stop-motion animated tale. Very few films have drawn me in with their first line of dialogue. This achievement has not been accomplished in an animated film, until now. Not only did it draw me in, but it also paves the way for an immersive experience designed to thrill and spark imagination in both kid and adult viewers. ""If you must blink, do it now."" #kuboandthetwostrings"
58,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,12 August 2017,Absolutely beautiful and refreshing,"First of all, the animation is incredibly detailed, beautiful and atmospheric. It's done mostly stop motion, but with visual effects to enhance some of the scenes such as the waves in the ocean and bright lighting effects. You will want to stare at it from start to finish; every scene is lovely. Some areas with slow motion and heavy action, you can see the cut between frames, but you're unlikely to notice this unless you're very interested in the animation, and it doesn't break the immersion even then.The story, is also very, very good. While some plot twists seem slightly rushed, or you can see them coming, much of the lore and deeper meanings behind parts of the story are buried in dialogue, meaning some younger viewers might be slightly confused or miss certain things. However, the story is also quite heavy, covering very sensitive and deeper themes, such as loss, death and family. It does this in the sweetest, most beautiful way possible, every emotional scene will leave you both crying and smiling.I have to give it a lot of credit for not hiding these themes from children. Many kids movies will step on eggshells, misrepresent or completely ignore, more serious topics even when they're relevant. There is violence, and it can be slightly graphic, they don't shy away from a little blood, but they also are very careful to only use it to enhance the narrative or atmosphere; helping to express the gravity of situations. This movie is suitable for children, even quite young children, but I would suggest you watch it with them as they might have questions. I would compare it to 'Inside out' in the way it treats children with agency and intelligence, but they are so different it's hard to compare.Kubo is a very refreshing character to watch. He feels like a real person; so does every other character. Everyone, even the background characters and 'bad guys' are brimming with creativity and personality. This movie does an amazing job of showing the good in everyone, and the bad in everyone. One more amazing thing about this movie; it makes you think. It has plenty of funny and lighter moments, as well as action and adventure. Many hints and subtle clues are dropped in dialogue and background details, the fan theories are fascinating, so there's plenty for the more serious viewers... Those of us who like to watch something 20 times to find every easter egg. ****Spoilers below****One of the only complaints I have about this movie, is the way they use a very heavy topic as a plot device. In the beginning, the mother gets a severe head injury saving her baby; it's shown later she had severe brain damage in a way, but it seems to come and go as it's convenient. She is completely catatonic at times, but suddenly able to rush to the rescue the second she's needed. This is a very minor thing, as it's generally portrayed in a compassionate and sensitive way, but the plot convenience can be quite obvious with how suddenly she seems to switch between fully functioning and not.***Slight trigger warning***Both parents die at the end, watching this movie is an emotional roller-coaster all the way, but if you've dealt with a lot of loss, it might upset you a little more. If a child has lost a parent, or a parent is sick or in hospital, now isn't the time to watch it. It's definitely worth watching still, but if this is a sensitive topic for you, go in prepared."
59,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,6 August 2017,Rating: A+,"I don't usually watch that many animated films throughout the year, but the ones I spend time with are always rewarding. This is a beautifully-animated movie with great characters, amazing action sequences and a heartfelt story! It's super entertaining, there's rarely a boring moment and it's surprisingly serious and mature.I feel that this was a film made more for adults rather than children since there are some scenes that the kids aren't definitely going to be able to fully understand, but that's fine because there's a ton of action scenes that are also so cool to watch ... It's a movie for everyone, you can watch this film in a more mature point-of-view while enjoying the fantastic action sequences. Remember, this is a stop-motion animated movie! It's amazing how they were able to achieve a masterpiece of this level, it's a brilliant achievement in directing.The characters are so captivating and interesting, the Monkey (Charlize Theron) is such a beautiful one, she steals the entire movie. Kubo almost brought me to tears at the end, I cared for him since the very first line and he's definitely going to be a character to remember. Every supporting character was great and my only minor issue with the whole movie is related to the ""villain's"" motivations (they aren't quite clear).I love how the depth that the characters had, it's such a surprisingly heartfelt and emotional movie rather than just a cool action film for kids. There's actually some scary scenes that I don't even think kids should watch! That's how good it is! The mythology is so incredible, they take their time to build a new world, a spiritual realm, magic and origami ... I love it!A movie with great main and supporting characters plus some cool mythology, fast pacing story, amazing action scenes and some really emotional moments make this movie flawless! It's one of the best animated movies that I've seen in all my life. Go watch it, have fun!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
60,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,20 July 2017,"""Life has a funny way of keeping things balanced.""","I had no idea this picture was created using stop-motion photography until I read some of the other reviews for it on this board. I found that to be quite amazing considering the seamless manner in which the characters interacted and how the story moved along. I can't even begin to imagine the incalculable number of repetitious movements required to achieve the effect rendered here, it's really quite staggering. It's almost as if the story itself takes a back seat to the artistic animation the film makers strived to achieve. That story does start out as uniquely creative and imaginative, though as it progressed, I thought Young Kubo's mission became more and more clichéd with the revelations of who the Beetle Warrior and the Monkey turned out to be. Nor was it clear to me why the evil sisters and the Moon King wanted to steal Kubo's remaining good eye. Maybe it was explained, but if it was, it sailed right by me. So all in all, the film was a visual delight but somewhat weak in story telling, though I'd recommend it for an appreciation of the talent and hard work involved in creating it."
61,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,23 September 2016,"If you must blink, do it now.","For some years now Laika has been one of the few lonely shoulders that bear the weight of stop-motion animation in Hollywood. There is of course Aardman's Wallace and Gromit, a revelation of clay-mation, and other trinkets and oddities (Mary and Max, Fantastic Mr Fox, Shaun the Sheep) but it remains close to a dying art as it can be. Audiences have moved onto to flashier, and indeed, quicker moving animation for their entertainment. This is one of Laika's biggest challenges in Kubo and the Two Strings, to produce constant and kinetic motion for an audience that is fed on a healthy dose of eye-popping, blurred action, in a medium where you have to stop and capture your frame for every tiny movement you create. And my, have they succeeded. There is not a hint of laziness or unearned visual beauty in the film at all. Laika could be commended for simpler crafting the foreground and background as they are, and stroll their puppets through the scene as they are. But the film is not simply comprised of pretty tableaux that serve the setting. We are constantly aware of its living, breathing nature, how it flickers and bristles. The wind is a constant presence, enabling the gentle sway of Kubo's silicone strands of hair (and for the same reason Monkey is feathered instead of furred). The sea is not content to simply lap at the shores as a blocky figure; they've constructed a wire-frame underneath to endlessly churn and heave giant waves ten stories high. Was it vital that the cold-open take place in the midst of a thunder-storm at sea, and later host another climatic battle atop a plunging ship? Not necessarily, but Laika know what they are capable of and embrace the challenge of the task, which in an industry that values the dollar value of a sequel more and more is a trait to be treasured dearly. Otherwise there is little point in constructing a larger-than-life skeleton warrior in which Kubo and his companions climb and swing on - but they rise to the occasion. The film's origins are from Japanese culture and folklore - it is reminiscent of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter (or Princess Kaguya), where stoic heavenly beings also sought to reclaim their own back into eternity and immortality. Kubo himself wields a shamisen, a three-stringed instrument that later holds a lot more significance that merely his livelihood. Kubo doesn't feel the need to ever explain how or why he is able to summon living creatures and figures from origami paper; it's magical realism imbued into a world that already seems quite magical, and Laika's additional loving touches only further exemplify that. The village partakes in the gorgeous obon festival, paying their respects to the dead and floating lanterns onto the river to keep their memories alive - although Kubo is the odd one out, without any memories or keepsakes to treasure and a mother that is slowly slipping away in time. The perceived villain of the story offers temptation in the form of an escape; why suffer from Earth's daily toil when you can ascend to the heavens and gain immortality? There's a vague Buddhist sentiment of transcendence here, countered by a slightly clumsy bit of sentimentality where Kubo reaffirms what her mother chose all those years ago; an imperfect Earthly existence where you can feel and love is much better than a blank eternity, the irony being that to do so is remove your eyes and blindly accept your fate. If there is a moment where you might want to blink (or stuff your ears) it's the American influence that maintains that any mainstream animation these days must also be a part-comedy. The generous market share slice that children have in this genre means not only American accents for a film with Eastern origins, but also dictates that every other McConaughey line has to be some goofy one-liner. It's a troubling recent trend in this area. Filmmakers clearly have the means and potential to be able to be heartfelt and emotional, but it is almost certainly liable to be reeled back with a joke; it's as if the corporate decision-markers don't trust audiences enough to be merely emotionally captivated, so they have to loudly signify with humour like one of those blinking, game-show signs blaring ""LAUGH NOW"". The tendency for the wise-cracking/wacky sidekick fares much better - he's there almost in spirit only, as the tiny little origami figurine of the late Hanzo, earning his laughs not through the script but with pantomime. And so eventually, with the help of his pointing katana they reach their destination, and Kubo is a smart enough film to shed those conventional action relics for something more meaningful, and in the end, more powerful."
62,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,21 August 2016,Not For Little Kids,"I saw ""Kubo and the Two Strings"", starring the voices of Art Parkinson- Game of Thrones_tv, San Andreas; Charlize Theron-Madmax:Fury Road, The Legend of Bagger Vance; Matthew McConaughey-Free State of Jones, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and Ralph Fiennes-Spectre, Red Dragon.This is a stop-motion/animated film by the Laika studios, who also did Coraline, ParaNorman and The Boxtrolls. This one is not for the little kids-some parts are slow and loses their attention and others are a little frightening, judging by some of the kids in my audience-but older kids and adventurous adults might like it-I know I did. The story takes place in Japan and concerns Art/Kubo, a one-eyed boy living with his mother, just outside of a village-there is a reason for the missing eye. During the day, Art goes to the village and plays his lute-a 3 stringed instrument-while telling stories of a samurai and evil forces battling it out. His lute is magical because when he is getting his Hendrix going, he has sheets of paper forming into origami and flying in the air, enhancing his story. He has to return before dark to take care of his mother so sometimes, he will leave in mid story, disappointing the villagers. Oh yeah, his mother also told him that if he did not return before dark, evil spirits would come out and get him and of course, he misses curfew one night and things do go haywire. Art is told that he must go on a quest to find 3 magical pieces of armor that will help him fight the spirits and their boss, Ralph/The Moon King. Charlize/Monkey and Matthew/Beetle are his traveling companions on his journey. FYI: This is Matthew's first venture into voice work on an animated movie. As the end credits start, there is a nice cover version of 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. It's rated ""PG"" for thematic elements, scary images, action and peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes. It's not for everyone but if you like Japanese culture, samurais, martial arts and reincarnation you might like this one. I would buy it on DVD."
63,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,26 September 2016,Best movie for kid and family,"""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is a hard movie to explain. There is a story in it and the adventure is grand and fun. The themes of the film are the values of memories and how we truly can never forget people that we lose throughout our lifetime. The strength of the film is the pure visceral experience it provides. The visuals and sound had a layer of depth and drama that you feel in your inner core. It is more of an experience than it is a movie that you watch. Throughout the film, I felt moments of sadness, loss, happiness, horror, fear, and accomplishment. Kubo and the Two Strings might be one of the best movies I've seen all year. In ancient Japan, Kubo (Art Parkinson) is a young boy who lives with his ill mother, Sariatu (Charlize Theron), in a cave on top of a mountain. Every day he goes out to a nearby village to tell stories by magically manipulating pieces of paper that form into origami that moves under music played from Kubo's shamisen to the villagers. He tells tales of great warriors seeking revenge while battling monsters, primarily of a samurai warrior named Hanzo, who is Kubo's missing father. Every day he returns to his mother when the town bell chimes signaling sunset. One day, Kubo has stayed outside after sundown, his mother's Sisters (Rooney Mara) find him and try to take his eye. After they destroy the village, his mother arrives to fend off her Sisters. His mother sends Kubo away by giving his wings. She tells him to find his father's magic armor in order to protect Kubo from his grandfather and his evil spirits. Kubo wakes up in a snowy blizzard, and meets Monkey (also voiced by Theron). Monkey tells Kubo that she is going to help him find the three pieces of the armor. They lead by ""Little Hanzo"", one of Kubo's origami to find the missing armor to the way to his father's armor, where they are greeted by Beetle. Beetle was cursed to take the body form of a beetle-like man, with no memories of his past. He discovers that Kubo is his master's son and vows to help him in his quest. The origami ""Little Hanzo"" shows them the way to an underground cave known as the Hall of Bones where they can find Hanzo's sword, the Sword Unbreakable. They fight against huge skeleton and at last they won and got unbreakable sword. Next, they arrive at a beach where Kubo uses his magic to create a boat out of fallen leaves, and they set sail across the Long Lake. The breastplate armor is underwater; then, Beetle and Kubo dive in to retrieve the breastplate. Kubo recovers the breastplate, but he stuck underwater because of monster eye. Beetle rescued Kubo in the water. They continue their quest.After arriving ashore on a nearby island, Monkey told Kubo about the monkey who is his mother memory. The monkey told about his father story and her story. She explains that before she met Kubo's father, she and her Sisters were sent to kill Hanzo. Instead, she fell in love with him, and they gave birth to Kubo. Her Sisters and Kubo's grandfather felt betrayed and have since branded her as an enemy. In that night, Kubo has a dream in which he is greeted by a ghost of a blind old man who shows him where to find the last piece remaining of his father's armor. They head to his father's damaged fortress to reclaim the armor. However, it turns out to be a trap. Sister who reveals that Beetle is in fact Kubo's father, Hanzo, whom they had cursed. Monkey (his mother) and his father sacrifices her life to allow Kubo to kill her Sister. After Kubo learn where the helmet truly is and with help of Little Hanzo, he fly to his village to find helmet. At the village, he is able to reclaim the helmet and puts it on. He find out a ghost of a blind old man was his grandfather who want to take his eye. Even with the armor, he cannot defeat his grandfather. At last, Kubo use his hair, his mother hair, his father hair to make string with all his village and spirit in his village, he then use those things to wipe away his grandfather memory. The villagers make Kubo's grandfather believe that he is a good man. In the end, heir spirits appear and stand proudly on either side of Kubo at the shore."
64,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,23 September 2016,Absolutely Beautiful!,"A dazzling display of the best that cinema can be! Laika and Focus Features' Kubo and the Two Strings is truly a testament to the art of motion pictures! Brilliantly animated in an eye-catching stylistic way, this film provides audiences with a simple and intimate journey through a dynamically epic world of adventure, laughter, and tears. Directed by Travis Knight, from the opening to the final fade to black, Kubo is arguably the best animated feature length film to hit theaters in a long time. It contains the incredible storytelling that few films, live-action or animated, strive for but often fail to accomplish. Rarely, do audiences witness a perfect film, but this one comes very close to being perfectly written, directed, acted, shot, edited, and produced. With an A-list of vocal talent behind the characters in this immaculately animated world, Kubo will surely impress all those who watch this fantastical story. In some ways, I could argue that this film displays signs of being self-aware. Self-aware in that this simple but effective visual story is all about the very concept of storytelling. Cecil B. DeMille said, ""the greatest art is the art of storytelling;"" and this film proves that, in a world of high concept blockbusters that are produced to simply generate revenue at the sacrifice of storytelling, there are films with beautiful imagery, writing, and even a great message that hold true to the very idea what launched more than 100 years of cinema.Following a daring escape from an unknown enemy across a treacherous ocean of tsunami sized waves, a young women survives a nearly fatal crash and washes upon the shore of a beach in the shadow of an imposing mountain with her infant. Many years later, Kubo (Art Parkinson) has grown up to be a young man with a passion for storytelling that he learned from his mother. Never having fully recovered from the accident, so many years ago, Kubo has the responsibility to take care of his mother. Harnessing his talent for magical origami, a stringed instrument, and storytelling, Kubo makes a little money each day for him and his mother. Little did Kubo know that his mother's warning to not stay outside of their home after dark was for good reason. Soon, Kubo will find himself on an epic journey to unlock a secret legacy that he could have only dreamed of. Along his journey, he meets up with a monkey (Charlize Theron) and a man-beetle (Matthew McConaughey) who protect and teach him along the way. Don't blink, even for one second, because you may very well miss something of grave importance.The first thing you will observe in this movie is the exquisite and stylistic combination of two different animation methods. Claymation, which most are familiar with, and the lesser used papermation. Although typically used by themselves to tell an animated story, the brilliant combination of both methods to concurrently tell this epic story will leave a lasting impression upon you. There is a beauty in this film unmatched by any other in recent times. In many ways, the visual appeal of this movie reminds me of the early Walt Disney and Pixar animated films. Audiences can easily witness the absolute passion in every movement, detail, and landscape. I was completely sucked into Kobo's fantastic world of Japanese influence. In addition to outstanding technical achievements in animation, lighting, and cinematography, Kubo is a film that is equally outstanding in its ability to tell a simple but inspirational story. It is the epitome of an ideal relationship between artists and engineers. This film successfully combines an artisan handcrafted charm with the precision of sophisticated visual storytelling technologies in a dazzling display of cinematic art that will surely be cherished for a lifetime.Simple. The plot is so simple but yet very much profound. While so many studios are cranking out franchises, adaptations, complex plots, and young adult dramas, the Laika production company chose a different route. It chose a route that proves that the mastery of visual storytelling that showcases the art of cinema is still alive. In a world of the business of movie-making, Kubo returns us to the art of filmmaking. Not confined to art house theaters in Greenwich Village or West Hollywood, this film is evidence that truly artistic masterpieces are still desired by the American audience. ""The art of making art, is putting it together"" (Sunday in the Park with George). Knowing that just the leaf ship sequence at the turning point between the first and second acts took 19 months to create, design, and produce, it is clearly apparent that a tremendous amount of time, love, and energy went into every frame of this stunning movie. As someone who has a passion for the very concept of storytelling, this film brought tears to my eyes because of the sheer beauty of the film and the experience of watching it on the big screen. Although it is an endearing film filled with love and adventure, it is also quite scary during some of the intense conflict between Kubo and those who wish to do him harm. From Kobo's magical origami birds and samurai warrior to the playful banter between Monkey and Beetle, I was awestruck at the brilliance of the film in both writing and visuals.I highly recommend this film for those who have not seen it yet. I only wish I had made it to the movie before last night. After hearing what others have said and written about this movie, I have come to the same conclusion that many have voiced: this film is exceptional by any known measurable means of evaluating a film. If any animated film this year is destined for an Oscar nomination or win, this one is it."
65,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,25 August 2016,A Truly Magical Film,"Kubo and the Two Strings, the next installment from the stop-go animation studio Laika is here, and I think it's an amazing film. I've stated for years that Laika could be the biggest competition for Pixar, and finally Laika has delivered a movie to prove me right. Kubo and the Two Strings is beautifully animated, conveys amazing amounts of emotional depth, and brings a true sense of magic. In the past I had been critical of some stop-go animation, but the works of Aardman and Laika have taken it to a premier level.This film's animation is gorgeous, simply put the characters, the settings, the creatures, they all look amazing. It shouldn't come as any surprise, Laika has consistently made beautiful films, but it's always impressive when you consider the amount of time and effort that goes into animating a stop-go animation film. Above the animation the looks of the film is amazing, as the animators used color so well to give the film a look, and even more impressively the animators weren't afraid to make it dark. That has been one of the best staples of Laika, it's boldness to be willing to make an animated movie dark (but only to an extent.) The boldness to make the film look dark occasionally, really exemplifies the film's impressive emotional depth. Much like Pixar, Laika seems to understand that the marshmallow fluff most studios give kids, are very one dimensional. While that fluff is in this film, there's elements of light horror in this film as well. Any film that can juxtapose kiddy fluff with any kind of horror tones, deserves credit for their depth and understanding of mood. It also helps make this film feel all the more magical, as if the presence of a character can change the mood of an area, which is amazing.The entire film's look and depth help create a truly magical film, one where imagination seems to be at full capacity for the writers and filmmakers. The film's villain characters, voiced by Rooney Mara, are creepy and perfectly designed, and the main characters are very well developed as well. This film uses color amazingly, especially blue, which is a common color used in films today, but the use of it in this film both enhances the story and the mood beautifully. Above that the voice work is also incredible, especially the work of Matthew McConaughey and Charlize Theron.All in all, this film is amazing, it may possibly be the best film of the year so far, although it's still early and Captain America: Civil War was pretty great as well. The story may have been a tad predictable in the end, but the magical look and feel of this animated film transcends a slightly predictable story. For those who love great movie and those who have imaginative young kids, see this in the theaters where the sense of magic can still be felt."
66,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,21 August 2016,The summer's best by far,"I had long been anticipating the release of ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" and needless to say, I was not disappointed. I have been a fan of Laika's productions, favoring their uniqueness-not only in stop-motion, but how they are able to make films both adults and kids can enjoy. I have seen all four of the Laika movies and by far, I believe, ""Kubo"" is the best.""Kubo and the Two Strings"" has such a thoughtful story with an heart-warming message that teaches about tradition, family, and courage. I found the uniqueness of ""Kubo"" to really stand out, what with the magic, monsters and storytelling done through animated origami. But I really enjoyed the character of Kubo. Not only is he a mama's boy, which he demonstrates by watching after his ill mother every day, but he is very courageous and I found him inspiring. He is just an all around lovable character you can't help but root for. Art Parkinson did a great job giving Kubo life.I do applaud Laika for the great job they did on visuals, storytelling, and sound in ""Kubo"". It was so nice to finally receive a genuine summer movie, especially after such disappointments like ""Finding Dory"" (so much hype, what a waste). ""Kubo"" captures the spirit of everything a family movie should be, and I highly recommend. For those worried it may be scary for younger viewers, do not worry. Of course, it all comes down to knowing your child well, but there was a group of 8-10 year old boys seated behind me who thoroughly enjoyed the movie (laughing loudly at the funny parts, getting into the fight scenes with loud ""Ooh''s). When exiting the theater one of the boys even told the ticket taker,""The movie was so cool!'Overall, ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" leaves you with a warm feeling you just can't shake, and don't want to either."
67,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,21 August 2016,Visually beautiful and emotionally powerful,"I kept hearing a lyric from Hamilton echo in my head as I watched this movie: ""Who lives? Who dies? Who tells your story?"" From a technical perspective alone, I'm in awe of Kubo. It features the best stop-motion animation I've ever seen. Although there was some augmentation with CG, the blend was seamless. (Stay for the credits where you actually see how one of the characters was animated.) Of course, technical achievements alone can't save a movie. Kubo has a unique story that kept me guessing most of the way through. It's a story about family and community and dealing with loss. The visual design of the movie is truly stunning, often lit like a candle flame and crafted like the origami that's so central to the story. There are occasional giant leaps of logic required to stay with the story, but like with Wizard of Oz this is a child's fantasy told by a child. So in the end I was okay with that. And the children in the audience when I saw it seemed to love the movie as much as I did. Kubo is a remarkable achievement and I enthusiastically recommend it."
68,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,21 August 2016,A visual and auditory masterpiece!,"Kubo is set in ancient Japan, yet created by Westerners. It is the story of a boy, told by the boy himself, yet he finds himself inside his own story. The story has a couple of holes, hence my score of 9 instead of 10. The film making carries you along so beautifully that you don't notice until it's over. The film making is extraordinary - combining stop motion animation with digital animation to create a wonderful ancient world of magic. And, the magic feels real. The characters are consistent, if impossible. And, the pace showcases the beauty of the story. The writers let you in on the plot as the characters learn it too - a wonderful approach that makes the audience a part of the film. Highly recommended!"
69,Kubo and the Two Strings,4,27 March 2017,"Nice animation, but painfully clichéd and Americanised","""Kubo"" felt wrong from the start and the reason are the completely Americanised characters. I watched the film together with my wife who is Japanese, and one of the first things she said when Kubo met the old lady at the market was ""the way she talks is too American"". Going by her judgment and by my own, having spent a lot of time in Japan and other Asian countries, as well as North America, I can only agree. All the character's mannerisms, body language, facial expressions, behaviour, relationships and everything else that makes a character, are painfully American. I wouldn't even call it ""Westernisation"", it's just distinctly American. I'm talking Mulan-levels of cultural appropriation, possibly worse. It's sad that people who appear to be so into Japanese culture they produce a costly feature-length film about it, hiring expensive Hollywood voice actors, show such shallow of an interest in their subject matter. While in the case of ""Kubo"", the result is just a disappointing film, it's actually quite scary to consider the blatant ignorance with which some Americans approach foreign cultures and mangle them until they fit what they know and understand.While the cultural appropriation is my biggest gripe with the film, the writing itself is also uninspired and the characters are mostly annoying. The plot is as thin as it gets and seems mostly just a necessity to showcase the next big set piece. What that leaves is a lot of fighting, screaming and bickering by the cookie-cutter Disney characters.As for the technical qualities: The animation is rather impressive, while some of the environments feel a bit uninspired and bland. This is the reason I'm giving ""Kubo"" four stars, but it's not enough to make a good film by a long shot."
70,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,3 February 2017,Skip Kubo and go straight to Kaguya,"'Kubo and the Two Strings' is not a bad movie by any means. It is a fantasy adventure in a Japanese setting, the story of a boy who lost his father and is in danger of losing her mother as well, and has to go on a dangerous journey with a talking magic monkey and a giant beetle samurai. It is reminiscent of Narnia in many ways - talking animals, kid protagonist, quest for magical items, the story's allegorical nature.However American appropriation of Japanese culture never feels as true as the thing itself. The storyline of 'Kubo' has elements that reminded me of a Japanese animated film, 'The Tale of Princess Kaguya' (I won't tell you which elements because I don't want to spoil 'Kaguya' for anyone who hasn't seen it yet) and that movie is superior to this one in every way except that it doesn't have exciting swordfights. If you can handle mature, slower paced storytelling, I suggest you go straight to the source and watch 'Kaguya'.Still, 'Kubo' has its strengths. It's a humane story, and a sad one, and it has actually surprising plot twists. It is also well crafted - it's a stop-motion animation like 'Corpse Bride' or 'Coraline', and the movement of the dolls is so expertly created that it's a delight to see."
71,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,1 February 2017,I thought it was better than Zootopia,"KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS is the fourth film from the production company Laika, the same team that released movies like ParaNorman and Coraline. Based on that resume, one would expect Kubo to be a dark and eerie storie full of strange visuals, and you would be right in that assumption. The key difference one might find is that this is more so a story about a family. It's sad they didn't get it quite right.There is some controversy surrounding the casting of an all-white cast to play Asian characters, but we can look past that. The story is a fairytale of sorts about a little boy who washes ashore as a baby with his mother. In her possession is little more than a shamisen (the Japanese equivalent of a banjo). Kubo grows and raises his mother (who is lost in a haze of confusion and distance) and earns his keep by using his mother's magical instrument to perform origami shows in the nearby village. He has heard stories about his now deceased father and how he was a great warrior. Like all kid heroes, he dreams of one day living up to his memory.We learn that it was his two aunts and grandfather that ultimately killed Kubo's father (kind of heavy for a children's movie, I admit) and that in order to prevent them from killing Kubo, he must remain hidden from the sky when the sun is down. I'm sure you can guess what happens next.The visual tapestries that weave together the story are simply remarkable, and the look of this movie will be unlike anything you have seen in quite a while. At times it became mirky whether or not I was looking at stop-motion animation or computer imagery, but the blurring of these lines worked in harmony to make a movie that would surely suffer had it been strictly one medium or the other. This is a movie that would be equally as stunning (if not more so) while watched with the volume off, allowing you to get lost in the framing of shots or the colors on screen.The film's absolute first lines are spoken by Kubo: ""If you must blink, do it now."" I had hoped this was a sign of a wonderful film to come, and by all means I tried my hardest throughout the screening to drink in as much of the film as possible. What was disappointing was the rest of the movie, the aspects of characters and plot that felt both boring and clichéd. Kubo finds himself alone and tasked with finding a suit of armor to defeat the final villain (you guessed it, his grandfather). He must procure a sword, a helmet, and a breastplate. Along the way, he makes friends with a beetle-man (quite literally a cursed man stuck in an in-between state) and a monkey that was once a charm Kubo kept in his pocket. Like The Wizard of Oz and all the other films like it, we know the hero must adopt some friends for his travel. The unfortunate part is that these characters just don't gel as a group and are reduced to simple comic punchlines to keep children entertained (I assume). Where the movie started out with a mature and brilliant setup, the back half of the story was simply a different, less sophisticated tone. There is also a significant twist near the end of the film that puts these two characters in a new light. The sad part is that the filmmakers didn't work to set them up properly or structure any sort of meaningful payoff. We find out this detail and simply go ""what?""Compared to other animated films this year (Finding Dory, Zootopia) I will still tip the hat to Kubo, a wholly original concept with a remarkable look. In a time when movies are nearly 100% sequels or reboots or any combination there of, Kubo is a unique movie that I know the general moviegoer will enjoy and children will find thrilling. It's not a bad movie by any means. I only wished it could have been that much better."
72,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,18 December 2016,I wish they had spent a little bit more time on the plot,"I came to watch the movie without any expectations. To be honest, I had had a hype about it for a while, but it died down as time passed, and I just came across it by accident, felt intrigued once again (without remembering my previous excitement after having seen the trailer), and decided to give it a try. I was appalled by the visual quality of ""Kubo and the Two strings"", given that the movie's style is mostly stop-motion. The color palette was wide in range - monochrome when need-be and beautifully vibrant when the scene called for it. There was an undeniable fluidity to the characters' movement, and the editing as well as the special effects were definitely satisfying to the eye, to say the least. I also enjoyed the soundtrack and the voice acting of the movie, which had clearly been given a lot of effort into. I especially loved the three strings's performances. The songs really gave a traditional Eastern feel to the movie that might have been somewhat incomplete without it. The Japanese cultural blend is something quite common in American animated works for the past few years, and ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" did an outstanding job of portraying the Japanese culture. There were a few minus sides to this work, however. Even though I started watching without expectations, I was a little disappointed that the plot was quite predictable. I could easily name ten instances where my guesses of the characters' next actions were correct. I will not go into details of those times, as it will only make this review too long and tedious. To sum every of those times up, I would use the phrase, ""Of course that happens."" (along with a slight eye roll, a sigh, an emphasize on ""of"", and a sip from my hot chocolate mug like an asshole) After researching, I found that it took two years to create ""Kubo and the Two Strings"". As said above, I was very impressed without the amount of effort put into the visuals, but I just had a small wish, a really small one, that they would put that much effort into the plot. Throughout the course of the movie, I felt like a lot of aspects was underdeveloped. The Moon King, although he was the reason that the whole movie happened, didn't come off as destructive as what I had assumed he should be after the tales of him during the movie. The relationship of Monkey and Beetle (Kubo's mother and father) was another example of underdevelopment. Sure, we eventually know that they had been married all along, but the switch between Monkey's attitude towards Beetle (suspicion to trust to something similar to friendship or love) was too abrupt, especially since she valued Kubo so much that she wanted to stab Beetle in their first encounter. It just made it feel like ""Okay, now they're like this. Sure. Oh, they're friends now? Since when did this happen?"" And maybe this is the effect of another downplayed element in the storytelling of the movie - Kubo's adventure. The journey to find that armor was a relatively treacherous one, but it didn't quite feel like that throughout the movie since the pacing of that part was just too fast. As much as I didn't enjoy the plot and its pacing, I was surprised of how powerful the ending was. Normally, after a villain is defeated in an animated movie, he or she usually gets a resentful treatment from the crowd. The Moon King was a typical villain. He destroyed the village and attempted to attack the villagers, but, at the end, when I predicted that they wouldn't treat him very friendly, I was wrong. And I'm glad that I was. What set him apart from other animated villains was that he received forgiveness. The villagers told him, after he had lost his memories, that he was a kind old man, the kindest in the village, even though he had just destroyed it. I just loved how they saw that he was blinded and decided to give him a chance to see. It taught us that everyone deserved forgiveness, and that the ways in which you tell a story can change people. Many considered ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" to not have a happy ending, and is therefore not suitable for kids, but what I see is a completely happy ending. Granted, the fairy tale-style happiness doesn't apply here, as Kubo's parents didn't survive at the end, but that is what makes the ending here so beautifully imperfect, so ""human"" and moving. Instead of choosing to destroy the person who took away his family - the Moon King, Kubo decided to forgive him and start life anew again (because he knew the Moon King, after all, was only a blinded old man), indicated by the last scene. He understood that they didn't leave this world just for him to live in sorrow and mourn for the rest of his life. Their departure motivated him to continue living his life and inspiring people with his- their story and adventure, though short, together. And, above all, he understood that they would forever live in him as long as he kept their story in his heart. Overall, ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is a visual masterpiece with a remarkable soundtrack and excellent voice acting. I just wish they had built a stronger plot to go with how beautiful it looked, though the ending did save it a little with impactful messages and a moving imperfection that makes it so human. However, the ending would have been even more powerful if the characters had been developed more fully throughout the plot. I would have given it a 7.75 out of 10 if IMDb had let me, but it was closer to 8 than 7 so I put 8 in the ratings."
73,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,1 December 2016,Symbolism revisited,"This animation movie produced by Laika has the ability to inspire you what life can be and why we care about life in a more symbolic way that is meant to be understood by the adults, while to be funny for the kids. This is to some extent the same style as Lewis Carroll in his novels such as Alice in Wonderland, through The Looking Glass, etc. Kubo, voiced by Art Parkinson is a little boy who is to discover his supernatural gifts through a pre-ordained quest that he's meant to carry out. The character of Kubo is a kind of bildungsroman that builds up as the story unfolds. One of the best moment, recognition in literary terms, is when Kubo knew that his father was always near him and even had dinner with his parents and that's again one of the tragedies that there are things that are really close us, yet in a blink of an eye their value, essence, and closeness changes suddenly probably because we only have one opportunity to blink."
74,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,16 November 2016,"Radiant and Breathtaking Visuals, Paired with an Adventurous but Thin Story","A young boy loses his parents to dark spirits and undertakes a mystical quest with the aid of an over-protective monkey, a beetle-themed samurai and the enchanted musical instrument over his shoulder. Charming and hypnotic, Kubo possesses a real sense of inner warmth, the kind that's often missing from shallower family films. I think the precise, breathtaking stop-motion animation is to thank for a lot of that. Clearly, a lot of care and painstaking effort went into the way the characters, landscapes and magical effects live, breathe and radiate. As a sheer visual showpiece, it's delightful; fresh and well-designed, loaded with winks and secrets and unexplored mystery, I could dwell here for ages and never run out of inspiration. The plot stumbles a bit, though, struggling to marry the journey's challenge with its destination, and only seems to scratch the surface of its larger potential. Charlize Theron is excellent as the film's motherly voice of reason, stern yet caring, but Matthew McConaughey was a mismatched choice as her bold-yet-brainless counterpart, the armor-clad insectine warrior. An impressive display of unbound creativity, which delivers a material counterpoint to the flood of CG kids' movies on the market today, I was deeply impressed by the looks and mildly underwhelmed by the story."
75,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,10 September 2016,a brilliant animation of the year,"The style employed in Kubo and the two strings bears apparent resemblances with ParaNorman and Coraline, which inevitably cultivates a positive preference for it prior to me seeing the movie. The narrative is brilliant; a heroic story intertwined in the life of a storyteller is itself enchanting. The art is sublime and takes my breath away. Character design is exquisite.However, I do feel the urge to address some limitations of this film. The motif is rather antiquated: a boy on a quest acquiring legendary items, each of which demand challenges. Yet, it's preposterous to discredit the effectiveness of such a story line. Furthermore, I find some humorous remarks inappropriate: they slightly disrupt the flow of the film. Adding to that, the co- existence of the origami as an incarnation of the father and the cockroach as his accursed physical body is subject to inconsistency."
76,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,5 October 2016,"Epic, gorgeous, rainbow of emotions, funny... and real! Excellent stop motion with 3D","It was a must to see this one in theaters on a big screen to admire all the details. The animation was fluid but I noticed slight pauses that only happen with stop motion animation... After the credit they show an enormous monster puppet on strings, moving like a robot! It's stop motion! But I sure hope that the breath taking origami is in 3D because the details are too amazing! They seem to have combined two arts perfectly, making visual effects that I rarely get to see.I laughed a lot in the movie. There's grief and they didn't hesitate to be dark and the monkey is cynical, but it makes good contrasts and balance with the boy's courageous attitude.I thought that the monkey and beetle were added just to embellish the movie and prevent the boy from being alone, but the story is much richer than that.I watch anime a lot but I never understood the tradition to send lid lanterns on a river. It was explained beautifully to a child and I got all choked up.There's a variety of weapon, I got impressed by one. There are many ways to defeat your enemy... and the ending surprised me with its wisdom.It's supernatural too... and the powers are majestic.The voice actors are very convincing. I almost forgot to mention them because it feels like it's truly their voices.It's amazing to actually look at something real, it's more convincing than just 3D... It's not fake, and I got a wide range of real emotions out of it, and real enjoyment."
77,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,4 October 2016,A Masterpiece of Storytelling & Action For All (spoilor alert),"In every movie that I had watch in the years there was rarely one movie within a year that has everything for everyone with great storytelling. This year, the movie that has everything for everyone is Kubo and The Two Strings.The movie starts off with a quote that grab your full attention ""If you must blink, do it now. Pay careful attention to everything you see no matter how unusual it may seem. If you look away, even for an instant, then our hero will surely perish."", from there we find our main character kubo who was taking care of his mother while going into town making some money by entertaining the townspeople with his magic of turning origami to life, but when he was attack by a pair of assassins sent by the moon king, kubo must begin his journey by finding his father's golden armor to defend himself against the moon king and his assassins. Along the way he was aided by a talking monkey named Monkey and a human/beetle warrior named Beetle.This movie shows a great balance of action, humor, drama, love, amazement, and heartwarming that you rarely find in any movie to have it all in perfect harmony. The best from this movie was when kubo find the golden chest armor and end up eye to eye with the garden of eyes.The pacing of the movie is well done, it even has a few twists, a sad but heartwarming ending, and within the movie a clear message of Alzheimer and the great importance of memories whether they bring joy and happiness or sad and melancholy and how much people should cherish them all.Kubo and the two strings is one of my top five favorite movies of all time and I would highly recommend on watching this movie or at least buy it because this movie is the kind of movie that will last for generations to come.Go and Watch Kubo and The Two Strings when you get the chance, you will thank me for doing this."
78,Kubo and the Two Strings,5,26 August 2016,A story of domestic violence and mental health issues,"Let me see, begins with Kubo's father dying. It's very subtle, you don't realize at first, and then it occurs to you that the father has died. This is particularly apparent as the mother is clearly having dis-associative and/or psychotic episodes as a result of the trauma and grief that she is experiencing - sometimes she doesn't recognize Kubo. Often Kubo has to wake and feed his mother as she cannot do it for herself. Overall, Kubo's daily care is generally neglected and he is left to his own devices, to wander around the village and talk with the street vendors. Then there's a lot of (extended) family domestic violence when Kubo's maternal aunts find him and his mother. They are really really angry and bitter with their sister (Kubo's mother) as she chose to have a relationship with Kubo's father against their father's (Kubo's grandfather's) wishes. Violent incidents between Kubo's mother and his aunts continue throughout the rest of the story. The mother's mental health worsens as she begins to believe that she is a monkey sent to protect Kubo from his aunts. Then, it turns out the father isn't dead after-all, but is wandering around with some kind of post traumatic amnesia diagnosis. He thinks he is some kind of samurai warrior that has been cursed as a 6-legged bug. Not even Kubo's mother recognizes him at first and then the penny drops - this is Kubo's dad! In a final incident of family violence, everyone in the family gets killed, except Kubo and his grandfather who resolves to be more loving/giving in future so Kubo isn't orphaned alone in the world. And it ends with a lantern ceremony (funeral) for the parents. Happy days."
79,Kubo and the Two Strings,5,12 May 2017,Slow n' low,"If you want to see a soap opera with melodramatic scenes, long speeches, full of moral content you must see this movie. But kids don't understand this concepts so is a boring movie for them. For me it was a boring movie too. Always trying to make emotions out from the audience with overused resources Animations are very good and I liked it a lot. But the whole movie is slow and low in quality, storytelling and with a cliché in the final scenes. No one will remember kubo in a couple of years."
80,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,6 January 2017,"This animation movie and I will forever be tied, together with the red string of fate. This film was very unique.","From the studio that created stop-motion hits like 2012's 'ParaNorman', and 2014's 'The Boxtrolls' comes Laika's newest stop motion film set in Medieval Japan. Co-produced by Travis Knight in his directorial debut, this sweeping 3-D adventure epic tells the story of a magical boy named Kudo (Voiced by Art Parkinson), who must locate a magical suit of armor worn by his late father in order to defeat a vengeful spirit from the past, the Moon King (Voiced by Ralph Fiennes) with the help from his protectors, Monkey (Voiced by Charlize Theron) and Beetle (Voiced by Matthew McConaughey). Without spoiling the movie, too much, the film is very similar to Laika's previous works; it also has dark, twisted, and occasionally scary animation feel to it. So, it might not be, for everybody. However, I do believe that Laika engages its audiences both young and old, by how great, their animation was, during the action scenes. There's something noticeably satisfying about watching this movie in 3D. I love how every intentional facial adjustment and movement for each individual frame work so well. Everything looks so detailed and perfect with little to any blemishes. The technicalities, and effort put behind the film animation action scenes prove that stop-motion is still going strong, even today. While, the action is breathtaking, I think the movie does stumbles a bit in the story and pacing. Don't get me wrong, I was intrigued by Laika's approach to the ancient Japanese setting. I love all the foreshadowing & metaphors. Absolutely marvelous. However, the meat of the story was just a recycled plot from their earlier film, 2009's 'Coraline'; with the whole eerie, otherworldly beings who wishes to ""save"" children from a ""bleak reality"" by stealing their eyes. It was very noticeable. Another thing, wrong with the plot is how confusing, it is, even after heeding the warning in the beginning of the film, about paying close attention, or our hero will surely perish. I get the idea that it is trying to say with the eyes and keeping your memory, but a lot of the visuals, don't make any sense. A good example is the lake scene, where I thought Kubo's magical shamisen instrument was surely lost. However, it just appear, back in his hands, out of nowhere. It seem awkward, seeing how it effects the 3rd act. The same, goes with his family's long lost heirlooms 'McGuffin' whom only purpose, was to act for a treasure hunt. Other things that bug me, was the way, Kubo's mother, becomes alive at night, and braindead during the day, due to the head injury in the beginning. Clearly, that means, there was no time, for her to support Kubo. So, how was Kubo raise from a baby!? Wouldn't he, truly starve!? Maybe, I'm pulling on straws, here, but those questions do need to be addressed. Also, I think, the movie spoil, who monkey and Beetle really are, way too early in the film. Because of this, the ending revealed by the Moon King didn't have the punch as it should be. Still, these minor bumps can be easily overlooked. Yet, I can't say, the same with the voice acting. I found Charlize Theron to be very boring as Monkey. The way, she talks is very dry, as if reading off, a script. Matthew McConaughney's voice on the other hand, seem really out of place. Don't get me wrong, he really does bring a lot of needed humor to the mostly humorless film, but hearing his southern American accent in a film that supposed to be in Japan is jarring to listen to. In my opinion, I think more Japanese or Asians actors should had been used in the main roles. After all, there is Japanese actors like seasonal actors like Dean Cain and Masi Oka that really needs some more work. Regardless of the voice acting, the music feature in the film by composer, Dario Marianelli is powerful and compelling. The instrument is featured in Regina Spektor's cover of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" which plays over the end credits and is included on the film's soundtrack is also just as good. Overall: It wouldn't supposed me, if this movie wins a few 'Best Animated film' of the year, award. It really deserves, much of the praise, it has been getting. In the end, 'Kubo and the Two Strings' is a movie worth seeing. It's music to my ears."
81,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,30 November 2016,A Film That Will Delight Your Inner Child and Nurture Your Adult Soul,"Kubo and the Two Strings acts as a gentle reminder that in a world of breathtaking CGI, stop-motion is still a relevant source of entertainment. The film follows Kubo, a one-eyed young boy living with his mom. Kubo is very independent because his mother is not always lucid. He uses his magical shamisen to create complex origami figures and tell stories to the villagers. One night, Kubo stays out past sunset and his two evil Aunts come to visit him and try to take his other eye. Kubo's mother saves him and, using the last of her magic, transports him somewhere else and brings his wooden charm in the shape of a monkey to life. Monkey informs Kubo that he needs to find three special pieces of armor so that he remains untouched by his Aunts and Grandfather. During their quest, they meet Beetle, a samurai that takes the form of a beetle and can't remember much about his past. The film follows the trio as they seek to find the infamous armor and protect the village from the tyranny of the Moon King. It's obvious that the creators put a lot of time and thought into their work. Without fail, every scene is picturesque and colorful. The setting is chock full of intricate designs, and the attention to detail is astonishing. The fish that Kubo and Beetle catch while they're on the boat have distinctive scales and other small, defining features. In my opinion, one of the more impressive aspects of the film is the usage of light. Whenever Kubo encounters dangers along his journey, everything becomes much darker. When his evil Aunts fight with Monkey, and when Kubo eventually faces the Moon King, there is an absence of natural light, which makes a lot a of sense. Darkness is typically associated with evil, while light is associated with innocence and feelings of contentment. When Kubo is performing for the villagers or spending time with Beetle and Monkey, the scene is bright to reflect Kubo's happiness. This constant switch between light and darkness is very consistent throughout the entire film. The constant changes in lighting can also partially be explained by the film's balance of comedy and suspenseful or upsetting scenes. The film even dares to blur the lines sometimes: a few of the suspenseful scenes contain comical elements. The comedy ensures that viewers are never left in a state of tension, fear or sadness for too long. Because the content is sometimes very heavy, a lot of comedy is required to uplift people's spirits. The comedy elements also show that the film is meant for a wide audience, including children. Kubo and The Two Strings tries to retain a certain lightness for its younger viewers. I think my favorite aspect of the film was that the characters, especially Kubo, seem very realistic. When Kubo first begins his journey with Monkey, she chastises him for not taking the whole situation seriously. Kubo is not an adult, and the film acknowledges that and acts accordingly. Kubo even mocks Monkey at points, and displays other childish behavior that makes him a more believable child protagonist. Kubo's mother's behavior is also very typical. After she becomes Monkey, she makes constant comments regarding his health and well-being. She tries her very hardest to protect him from harm, even going so far as to put her own safety at risk. Overall, Kubo and the Two Strings is a fantastic film. The technical and creative elements, as well as the realistic, likable characters, work together to tell a simple adventure story with plenty of unique elements. The film leaves you with an interesting, thought-provoking perspective: memories, which cannot be destroyed, are the most powerful things that we possess."
82,Kubo and the Two Strings,,26 November 2016,Downright Beautiful,"I know this review is too late. I saw this movie back in mid-October, but better late than never.Kubo and the Two Strings has everything I wanted for it and more. Firstly, the animation is tough to be taken for granted. It's just too beautiful. Every detail, the scale, the whimsy, it's just incredible to look at! I also like how it lingers to them, unlike most animation today that is mostly frantic. The plot itself is also pretty engaging. The quest pretty much felt like a Legend of Zelda game, with all the strategies, the monsters and even how the items are presented. But the center of it all, it's classic animation where it doesn't really care how dark it gets, it's all about telling a compelling story, even genuinely. I know it's a shame that not many are actually seeing this in theaters, but I can see this movie being remembered in the next few years, the same way how people remember Scott Pilgrim more than The Expendables. And yeah Laika, never stop making movies, please!"
83,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,22 November 2016,A marvellous adventure...,"Laika Entertainment Studios - specializing in stop motion animation - are back in marvelous form with Kubo and the Two Strings. Their latest oeuvre isn't quite on the same level as their masterpiece , Coraline, but as yet a astonishment to observe. Kubo is a visual pleasure , one of the few films this year that must definitely be seen in 3D. The story loses a bit energy in the third act, but generally creativity of the film is charming. Kubo cause to recall us that not all wide release animated films have to be so sweet in their form and approach. Whether you're a new Laika fan or not, Kubo and the Two Strings is a breath of fresh air when compared to more family friendly fodder. It looks amazing. The plot is great, and good enough to warrant a bee line to the theater. I wonder how many kids will be taking shamisen lessons after watching this."
84,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,19 November 2016,"Kubo! Symbolisms, Metaphors and Art at it's finest.","If you must blink, do it now.For this story sets an adventure, with no twist, no suspense but just a poetic message with a beautiful narrative. Set in an ancient Japan where samurais and lords ruled the lands, Kubo, a boy with one eye, sheltered atop a mountain, makes his living sharing stories with the elderly and young of the village beneath. His origami that breathes life with magic and the music that casts the spell, mesmerizes his audience and captures their heart. Kubo, unfortunately, could never finish his story for he must return home before sundown and this displeases his audience, after all, who doesn't like an ending to a fine story? Atop the mountain, there lies a cave, inside the boy lives with his mother. He feeds her and looks after her. His mother is a peculiar character, her life has a curfew of it's own where her eyes goes almost lifeless and she starts losing memory as she awakes. Kubo's adventure starts when he stayed past sundown and his mother's sisters come to hunt him down.A talking monkey, a beetle-man and a paper samurai become his companions in his quest to find the armor that will protect him against his grandfather, the Moon King and his two younger daughters, when Kubo's mother sacrificed herself to protect him.Kubo and The Two Strings is not just a quest for some armor, it touches on topics with deep meanings and gives you certain ideas to ponder over. A question of perfection of humanity, of being blind to sufferings, of life after death, of love beyond all power.In the end, we may have wished a lot for the boy, the boy may have wished a lot for himself but there is one thing that we all wished, for this story to have a happy ending. And though, bittersweet, I would certainly say I went through the credits with a smile."
85,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,19 November 2016,"The best of the year, so far...","Wow, how do I describe this film? Miyazaki meets Disney? One of the most beautifully animated movie? I wholeheartedly praise the creators for crafting such a wonderful piece of art. This fresh take on Samurai legend is strong in narration and emotions, and entertainingly funny at the same time. Travis Knight weaves this one in such a fashion that one can only complete the movie with tears trailing down their cheeks. Kubo and the Two Strings is a stroke of genius that hides under a simple story line.It's a whole new quest in a whole new world with a whole new, soulful characters. I strongly believe characterization is an important aspect of movie making. Even with a weak script, you can create an engaging film, if your characters are interesting with traits that goes beyond spectrum. I've also seen movies with strong content fails due to the lack of strong characters. Kubo and the Two Strings had a predictable story, yet a strong screenplay and it is rich with well-structured characters. Beatle and Monkey are the best side-kicks, until they turned out to be more than side-kicks, since R2-D2 and C3PO. Theron and McConaughey really help to solidify their existence with their voices. And, boy-o-boy the pieces of dialogues that are in this one! Simply brilliant.Last but not least, the end credit song ""while my guitar gently weeps"" beautifully performed by Regina Spektor, is a fitting sent off to a heart-touching emotional trip. Kubo and the Two Strings is so far the best movie I've seen this year because it's rich in so many aspects. One must even can argue about the psychological aspects that the movie deals with and how it can touch our hearts and feelings..."
86,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,13 November 2016,Gorgeous Animation That Tells a Touching Story,"Stop-motion animation has always been my favorite kind of animation. Not only is it unparalleled in the field when it comes to sheer labor and hard work, but I also think it's the most beautiful. Everything is so meticulously crafted to bring these stunning characters and worlds to life, that it all has such a vibrant, lifelike quality to it. Laika Entertainment, the top dogs (no pun intended) when it comes to stop-motion animation, pumps out yet another engaging, gorgeous picture that will join the ranks with their other greats, like 'Coraline', 'ParaNorman', and 'The Boxtrolls'. 'Kubo and the Two Strings' is Laika once again flexing their muscles as the best of the best in film animation. Yes, not just in the stop-motion realm, but in all of film animation.In ancient Japan, young boy Kubo (Art Parkinson) lives with his mother (Charlize Theron) in a cave, high up on a mountain. Every morning he runs down to the local village and tells the citizens an epic story about a valiant hero on a quest to vanquish an evil villain. Once dusk approaches, Kubo must retreat back to his cave, due to his mother instilling in him fear of his evil grandfather, who will come and take him away. One fateful night, Kubo doesn't return in time and as evil forces come for him, he must embark on his own epic quest to defeat the evil.Laika has always been one to impress, especially in the animation department. Credit must be given to their CEO, here turned debut director, Travis Knight, who shows he really knows how to direct a stop motion film. There's so much detail that gives so much life to these little creations. The landscape shots are some of the most beautiful I've seen in any film, animated or not. Backgrounds are packed with many different characters, all performing various tasks. Rice falls from a pair of chopsticks and slides down somebody's cheek. You can really sense all of the hard work and soul that went into making it all seem so real. When you witness an intense, highly choreographed fight scene that had to be carefully animated frame by frame, it's no wonder it took them five years to make! Although the animation sometimes drifted into somewhat of an uncanny valley territory, it's still so impressively done that you can't help but be drawn in. A lot of the style is very Japanese inspired, with everything having an almost ancient origami quality to it. This really added to the overall setting and tone. It's evident that everybody's heart and soul went into making this film truly one of a kind. While all of Laika's films use the same animation techniques, every film they make feels different from the last.Another one of Laika's strong suits, and what I think puts them above every other animation studio (yes, even Pixar), is that they never treat children like they're dumb. They're smart enough to realize that children don't need explosive action or immature fart jokes every five minutes in order to be interested. All you need is a good story with good characters. This is also helped by the fact is that they don't make films for children, but for everyone. Yes, their stories are simplistic, but their themes and pathos throughout them can resonate with both young and old. The film gets surprisingly melancholy at times, with themes of dealing with loved ones passing on, family dilemmas, and much more, but it's those moments that really elevate the film above its average screenplay. While I was thoroughly engaged, a lot of the plot progression and story elements felt very contrived, underdeveloped, and predictable. The pacing also felt a bit too rushed, especially near the end with a climax and antagonist I wasn't completely on board with. However, when the heart is all there and the story is engaging, these are only minor shortcomings.Laika once again proves why they're the current juggernauts in cinematic animation. Not only are you getting some of the most breathtaking animation around, but you're also getting an engaging, heartfelt story with fun characters, and creative action sequences that can be enjoyed by all ages. While there was a bit to be desired in the writing and storytelling departments, all of the positive aspects are universal and relatable enough for people to be engaged. There's no overtly adult humor to pander to us old curmudgeons, but also no stupid juvenile humor for the kids. It truly is a film for everybody. Laika actually wants to make art for everybody to enjoy and that will actually resonate with people. They have succeeded every single time and I can't wait to see what sort of story they'll tell next."
87,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,13 November 2016,A stylish blend of Western and Eastern culture,"This is an animated fairy tale, so you might be forgiven for having low expectations for it, yet it somehow manages to bridge the gap between child and adult, West and East. Studio Laika does a great job with the animation, combining hand drawn computer graphics with stop motion animation, but what shines is the story, which blends typical US clichés like protecting children and the individual quest with Asian ones, like destiny and respect and honor for your family.Follow the tale of a young child who is pursued by his evil ""heavenly"" grandfather and aunts, while he is looking to honor the legacy of his mother and father. The ""story magic"" from this fantastic Japan mixes with the story elements of the film and manages to warm the heart and give hope without falling into the exaggerated dramatic but ultimately empty tropes we are used to from movies this age.I didn't give it a perfect grade because I felt like there was more room for subtlety. Many of the reveals were glimpsed from way back and some scenes, especially those related to male character interactions, were short and rushed. Other than that it was a great film, suitable for both children and adults."
88,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,12 November 2016,Gorgeous & Creative Animation meets Epic Storytelling to tell This Moving tale that Touches Your Heart,"This Year has been a blast for Original films like Zootopia , Shallows and Don't Breathe. Kubo and the two strings is no exception along with the fact it joins the likes to some of the best movies this year.Lets break it down one by one. The Animation of Kubo and the two strings is beautiful and the Creativity makes it more interesting and worth watching.After Coraline and Paranorman I do have some expectations from this film but It blew them away standing at excellence on the technical basis. The Characters are really well crafted and the way they each have a story and contribute to this film in a very proper way is really nice.Secondly if you watch closely every character represents a particular value which when you know it you will be enlighten. Now the Best part of the Movie is the Story telling technique and the background. I simply love fantasy and magic movies more than any other as they bring out imagination to the big screen efficiently.The Storytelling techniques used in this movie as very vibrant something I have looking for in movies but I couldn't find but this one have it all.It's like listening the tale of a warrior in your childhood.The Magical way is also very nice to see and all the action sequences are great.Epic quests drive this movie to a point it feels actually having a worldwide appeal.The use of Paper , musical instrument and the whole Japanese background adds to its beauty.Thirdly The film has some very nice values and near the end you find that it's very true to its title. The point at which you find this , it's so great you will see it again.I can easily say it's no doubt if it grabs Best Animated Feature Oscar this year but only it faces competition from Zootopia.Finding Dory and Sausage Party has less chance. Moana is not yet released and Trolls cannot even grab a nomination.It's really a shame that people didn't watch it making it moderate box office success and nearly a flop, still it's getting all the praise it deserves. Seems after Ghibli and Dreamworks , Laika can snatch a Best Animated Feature from Disney/Pixar. So final word - Kubo and the two strings stands out from the crowd owing to its originality , creativity , epic storytelling filled with compassion and love for family and humanity."
89,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,11 November 2016,A great film for any family night,"Kubo and the two strings is a heart warming, coming of age movie, for the whole family. Adults, you will appericate the story line and the plight that Kubo undergoes. Kids will love the animation and the characters. From the moment that the movie started, I fought back the tears. You see a mother and baby in the middle of the ocean one moment and the next, you see them ship wrecked on a beach. You skip forward a few years to when Kubo is about the age of ten. He is now a caregiver for his mother who you come to understand as mentally ill, with something like alzheimer's or dementia. Daily young Kubo goes into the neighboring village and tells fantastic stories of a Samurai Knight, and how he battles the evil Moon King and his army, all while playing his Sangen (a Japanese Guitar) and creating Origami creatures for the story. But as the bells ring for night to come forth, Kubo runs home. It seems that his mother only ""comes to life"" when its night time. And then shortly there after returns to a catatonic state. One day while in the village an old beggar woman who befriended him tells him a story of how she speaks with her dead husband at night during a certain ritual. Kubo, who is confused and longing to know anything about his father who was said to be the greatest Samurai, goes to the ancestral resting place and tries to summon his father. Time gets away from him and night befalls rather quickly. Soon two masked spectral spirits appear, and tell him that they are his aunts. Kubo is then told the reason he is missing an eye is due to his grandfather who only wanted to have his other eye so that he could join them in the heavens. Kubo begins running back to the village. The two spirits attack and destroy the village. When they are almost upon him, his mother shows up and uses the last of her magics to activate a totem and to create wings to whisk him away to safety, far away from his blood thirsty aunts. Kubo then wakes up in a vast frozen waste land with a monkey looking after him. The monkey begins to address Kubo, telling him that they need to go on this quest to find a magical suite of armor that his father once wore. So Kubo and Monkey set off on a quest. Kubo is awaken by the monkey, saying that the origami papers that he carried in his pack, were flying around and that in his sleep he created an origami Samurai. The same Samurai from his stories. This little paper guardian, shows them the way to the armor's pieces, which consist of a sword, a breast plate, and a helmet. Along the way they come across a Beetle who was once a Samurai who was cursed to live the rest of his life as a beetle. After that the unlikely foursome come across a cave that has the sword in it. But much like Kubos life, it was not an easy task to retrieve it as it awakened a tall skeleton warrior, which they had to defeat. They then come to a large body of water, which Kubo uses his magic and his Samgen to create a boat made out of leaves. Monkey exclaims to him how his power is growing. As they set sail, the little paper Samurai point out that the breast plate is at the bottom of the water. Kubo remembering a story that his mother told him, of eyes that show you what you want to see most, lived at the bottom of the water. Beetle offers to dive in and look for the breast plate as ""beetles can hold their breaths for a really long time under water, and are great swimmers."" After quite some time passes Kubo dives in after Beetle and the breast plate. Monkey is then attacked by one of the evil aunts. While Kubo is under the water he finds the breast plate, and the eyes. They show him that the Monkey is actually his mother in the form of a spirit totem (MIND BLOWN)...Becoming dazzled by the eyes, he begins to drowned. Beetle swoops in and begins shooting the eyes and rescues Kubo. During this time Monkey is battling one of the aunts and defeats her. Kubo and the gang then continue their quest to find the helmet, which is back at his fathers fort. Once back at the fort one of the aunts reveals to Kubo and to Monkey that Beetle is actually Kubos father. So Kubo now armed with this new knowledge is able to defeat his aunt, but not after losing both his parents again. Kubo then uses his magic, to fly back to his village to adorn the helmet to complete his suite of armor. He then has to battle his grandfather The Moon King. At which point The Moon King transforms into a giant centipede like demon. Kubo uses his wits, and magic, to defeat his grandfather and makes him mortal. In his mortal state he loses his memories, and the village people tell him how he was a just and honest man, and how he was kind. The story ends on an upswing. Over all the movie was really good. I love how engaging it was, and all the attention to detail they provided in it since it was a stop motion claymation. I highly recommend this for any family night."
90,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,11 November 2016,Sings a strong song to the heart,"You get emotionally invested with this movie,Laika has hit the heart strings with here. As soon as it starts you don't lose focus, it's as if a strong magnetic pull was in your eyes. I am a man and I can admit that I let out some ""man-tears"". This movie has been one of the best I've seen this year and will stick with me for a while. It is definitely a buy on blu-ray, a must watch, and re-watch as well. If you have not seen this yet, teen-adult(kids if don't mind crying from spooky parts) then I strongly suggest you do! This movie does not disappoint, if you have an open mind and need a refresher away from daily life, the antidote is here, 100% confirmed. A+++++++"
91,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,9 November 2016,The Vidiot Reviews...,"Kubo and the Two StringsThe saddest thing about Japanese zoos is that the monkeys are usually cursed royalty.And while the ape in this animated-adventure isn't a prince, he was born from magic.Sent by his mother to retrieve his missing father's suit of armour so he can be protected from his evil aunt (Rooney Mara), Kubo (Art Parkinson) is accompanied on his quest by a monkey (Charlize Theron) and a cursed man-beetle (Matthew McConaughey) with amnesia.Together they must thwart Kubo's grandfather (Ralph Fiennes), who wants to turn his grandson into an immortal by stealing Kudo's last good eye.More mythical than most western animated features, Kubo musters enough eye-popping animation and spirited storytelling to put those sing-along cartoons to shame. Able to entertain adults and children alike, Kubo captures your attention from the get-go and never relents.Moreover, it's nice to see a Japanese cartoon where the father isn't just a tentacle.

92,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,2 November 2016,Go on an adventure with Kubo!,"""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is an American English-language movie from this year (2016) and do not mistake it for an Asian film because of the style and story. This has nothing to do with Studio Ghibli for example. Then again, the style really isn't Asian at all, it is just what Asia would look like from the American perspective. Oh yeah, it is an animated film that runs for 100 minutes approximately. The director is Oscar nominee Travis Knight (""Coraline"", ""The Boxtrolls"") and the script comes from no less than a trio of writers that all have a solid deal of experience too in their fields, not just in animation filmmaking.These slightly over 1.5 hours here are about Kubo, the title character: a little boy who lives with his mother and who only has one eye. This already shows us that there is certainly a darker general tone in here. It is definitely true. There are spooky ghost creatures (the title character's evil aunts looking like geishas) who want to take his other eye from him as well. There is a great deal of violence and fighting sequences and also some innocent characters get killed, actually fairly graphically when the good guys go fishing. And the film is full of legends and myths. With the help of a huge beetle and a resilient monkey, Kubo goes on a quest to find a piece of armor that can protect him from his aunts' and grandfather's violence. Will he find it? You know the answer.Thos movie is not really about if Kubo will succeed, but about the rocky path to success and how he develops as a character. There are some nice emotional moments in here, for example I like the reference about eating and sitting between two people. However, most of the movie is really about action scenes and the adventure that our trio of heroes is on with some (surprising?) revelations about who they really are. If you like animated films with a Japanese touch, then this one is certainly worth checking out for you. The characters have their flaws, but are still (or maybe because of that) pretty likable. And there are moments when the animation is breathtakingly beautiful and overall the cultural and atmospheric impact that the film makes is very good. People are talking about this film right now as if it is some kind of revelation and I would not say that it is really that good, but it's a solid little animated adventure film that is maybe more suitable for grown-ups and not really for very young audiences. I enjoyed the watch and I can perfectly see this film receive an Oscar nomination a couple months from now. It would not be undeserved. I recommend the watch. Definitely among the better animated movies from 2016. Go check it out."
93,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,26 October 2016,Kubo is very refreshing and nicely told,"At the beginning you have a boy that is facing how his mom is slowly losing touch with world and it's very difficult for him, so he tries to find some hope at his fathers grave. After night came and he did not went back as his mother always told him to do everything went down. Two evil sisters came after Kubo and mother saved him but sacrificed herself. Then he encountered beetle that he will later find out is his dad and monkey is his mothers presence. At journey he faced giant skeleton, large eyes that will possess you and drag you to death and his grandpa that is a giant dragon. Movie is very intelligently written and very twisty with a lot of mysteries that are revealed later in movie. Movie is also very funny and story is very interesting with some jumps and cuts. Great thing is how Kubo had to pass so many obstacles to survive and how good it was done on screen. There are some things that are confusing but you get passed them easily. 3.5/4"
94,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,22 October 2016,Possibly the best animated movie I've seen,"I was a bit sceptical paying myself sick for a ""kids' Play Doh-movie"", but seeing all the positive reviews and considering the fact that the movie is based on a milieu that I find very interesting, I decided to take a shot for it.The visual experience is just enchanting from the first frame to the last. I loved it. The story was very beautiful and the plot kept me glued to the screen till the end and had enough twists to make it enjoyable and unexpected.However, I can't give this movie a 10/10 rating. While it has the potential to be almost perfect, for me it lacked something. You can quite easily see that the main audience targeted for this movie is children above 7 years old. I am childish myself, but from a movie like this I expected something different.While the story is partly sad,emotional, exciting and maybe partly scary, too many times was the serious scene ruined with a joke or funny event. Comedy is like chili - the right amount gives flavour but too much takes it away. This one had just too much.Another thing is that while the visual experience is gorgeous, the audiovisual experience is just like in every other movie. From a setting like this, I would've experienced more of ""artistic"" and ""ancient"" way of speaking. But there has not been enough imagination in the script. Words are laid down on the paper just to provide the meaning of them, but in what way, it does not fit the movie. Even the wisest characters sound like average people nowadays.Despite this, it's still a great movie and worth seeing!"
95,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,12 September 2016,Laika's best yet and a near-masterpiece,"This is coming from somebody who has found so much to love about all of Laika's films with very little to criticise (not everybody liked 'The Boxtrolls', and to me it is their weakest but it was still very enjoyable).A good animated film, in my book, should not only have good animation, music score, writing, story, characters and voice acting, but should also make the most of its concept, make one immersed in its world from the get go, entertain and be emotionally investible. 'Kubo and the Two Strings' ticks all of those boxes, and along with 'Zootopia' (or 'Zootropolis' in my country) it is in a completely different league to all the animated films released this year, a competition that has been very much mixed in quality but one where the only one that misfired completely was 'Norm of the North'.'Kubo and the Two Strings', although a near-masterpiece, is not quite perfect. Pacing occasionally could have been a little tighter, along with a slightly rushed ending, and while the comedy is hugely entertaining and often hilarious there was a stretch where there could have been a little less with that stretch of constant jokes having a somewhat cluttered effect.On the other hand, there is so much to adore and while Laika's output is remarkably consistent 'Kubo and the Two Strings' is their best yet. It is also a film where reasons for it not doing better at the box-office is perhaps due to marketing that was both not enough and misleadingly not great and perhaps having a concept that somewhat alienated some before release, nothing to do with one country disliking it.Where 'Kubo and the Two Strings' particularly is in the visuals, which are never less than entrancing and on the whole just out of this world amazing. By far one of the year's best-looking films and the best animated (not as colourful as 'Zootropolis', but a little richer in detail, more intricate and unique for animation this year and overall). It also creates an incredible atmosphere, magical, bold and intimate, and immerses one fully into the world created with the full impact it should. The music score is full of energy, whimsy and pathos, never intrusive or over-bearing but always memorable.Scripting has a fine mix of humour and emotion. 'Kubo and the Two Strings' is a genuinely funny and entertaining film, but it is also a genuinely moving and emotional one. The story is not flawless in executions, but succeeds more than it misses, with metaphors that are richly interwoven and imagined and has plenty to amuse children and emotionally invest adults. So don't let the concept put you off, there is something for everybody if given a chance. Also don't think it should be that scary for children, there are dark moments but never in a traumatising way.Characters are rich in character, easy to relate to and quite imaginative, Beetle is particularly memorable. The voice acting is superbly done, with Charlize Theron, Ralph Fiennes (in a tailor-made villain role) and Matthew McConaughey being notable standouts.Overall, of a remarkably consistent output 'Kubo and the Two Strings' is Laika's best yet and is very close to a masterpiece, also as said in a different league to all the other animated films seen this year, either only second to 'Zootropolis' or in the same class. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
96,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,19 August 2016,Laika's Best Looking Film,"If you must blink, do it now. So starts the tale of Kubo and the Two Strings, a chanbara inspired animated fantasy about a young boy with amazing gifts and even more amazing enemies. On a stormy night, the young baby Kubo (Parkinson) is brought to the outskirts of a remote village by his severe-looking mother (Theron). As Kubo grows into adolescence, he ventures into town every morning to earn money as an origami storyteller; using a magical shamisen to bring his characters to life. When he returns home, he cares for his sickly mother by the light of a makeshift hearth. Piecemeal by piecemeal the audience is primed into a world full of mystical creatures, selfless heroes, stunning magic and an age-old vendetta that pit's Kubo against virtual Gods.As a work of stop-motion animation, Kubo and the Two Strings just might be the best looking thing to ever come out of Laika Entertainment. The images on screen are beyond breathtaking with painstaking detail brought into every spellbinding period specific set-piece and every darkly resonant tonal shift. Furthermore, young children (and the young boy or girl within us) will be beside themselves in awe when the origami magic really hits its crescendo midway through the movie. spiders, birds, snakes and even samurai warriors are constructed out of multicolored paper. As soon as the film was over I personally wanted to go home and dust off the old origami workbook and see if I remember how to make anything.As a story, Kubo can be accredited for being uncharacteristically mature and even a little somber for a children's movie. It stands alone foisting upon the viewer themes of loss and remembrance that isn't just there as a hurdle to get over but as a reality meant to be both felt emotionally and in Kubo's case metaphysically. There's real pain within the excitement and fastidious world-building. Pain that may just go over the heads of your little ones but will hit anyone paying attention like a ton of bricks.Yet Kubo isn't without some serious drawbacks the largest of which is its rather byzantine plot. After ignoring his mother's warnings of staying out of the moonlight, Kubo is stalked by two phantasms who seek to take his only eye. After fleeing, Kubo is allied with a Japanese Macaque (Theron) and a warrior resembling a Beetle (McConaughey). Revelations involving Kubo's new friends were probably expected to produce grasps but succeeding in only producing confusion. What's worse, the epic world building has an epic amount of exposition to go with it. Instead of letting the story breathe when it needs to, the rules of the film are clunk out like the rangy spare pieces of a model set. I wanted to know more about Beetle. I wanted to know more about Monkey. But instead we're treated to long tracts of dialogue explaining in exhausting detail the birds in the sky as congruently relevant psychopomp.Yet if the worst thing that can be said about a movie is you wish you could know the characters better then we're in good hands. The voice acting is superb with the young Art Parkinson holding his own as a charismatic leading lad against a tsunami of veteran players. And director Travis Knight proves he's got the talent and discipline to maximize on the Homeric themes of Kubo having cut his teeth as lead animator on other Laika projects Coraline (2009) and Boxtrolls (2014). Here's hoping that with a little bit of fine tuning, Kubo's pulpy blend of sorcery and swordplay will yield a trilogy rivaling Hiroshi Inagaki's Musashi Miyamoto (1954-1956) works. As it stands now, Two Strings is quite a yarn."
97,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,20 August 2016,Superb,"This is a wonderful movie. It's not perfect but it's a fantastic tale that holds your attention from the first scene. Why do I think it's so good? Well, it goes far beyond my merely ""liking"" it. As an anthropologist and linguist who's familiar with Japanese culture, I was struck by the weaving of Japanese folklore into a captivating tale of a heroic journey. You have the boy, wounded from infancy by his grandfather whose mother is injured. The fetish is the three string samisen which arranges colored papers into origami figures into action to tell a story. The instrument is also wounded as it's missing a string. In an attempt to contact his departed father, Kubo the one- eyed principal endangers himself and winds up in a strange land with a monkey as a mentor who tells him of his quest. Another ally is a huge beetle who provides comic relief and assistance against Kubo's Noo-masked aunts striving to take his other eye.The tale unfolds in an amazing collage of several Japanese ghost and folk tales. The cultural depictions and insights are many and the CGI are delightful. As an anthropologist, I kept wondering what happened to the monkey's tail but that feature offered only a slight distraction."
98,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,18 August 2016,We wondered about the wonderful world of CORALINE and now we experienced the beautiful KUBO.....,"KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS is the most ambitious feature for Laika Studios till date. Laika studios already introduced us, Coraline. We experienced the wonderful world of Coraline and that is also a very good movie and visually stunning creation. After the huge success of Coraline, Laika studios starts their most expensive project named KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS. this movie is directed by Travis Knight and the casting (voice) is very interesting and I want to tell you this is also a very good movie and you will surely enjoy this. It is no wonder that the VFX and the animation graphics of the movie will be good and the story is also good. But the main positive thing is the direction and the script. The story is very good and the script is very well written. Director Travis Knight has done a very good job by executing the story, the chemistry between the actors and the subplots of the movie are also well organized. Another plus point is the animation quality. We already know about Laika studios and their reputation of animation, in this movie the animation quality is very good and it is very supportive for the storyline and for the character maps.I already told the chemistry between the actors is very good. Especially Charlize Theron, Ralph Fiennes have a done a wonderful job. But the surprise came from Art Parkinson. He has done an outstanding job by his natural mindblowing voice. This is a very good example of how a voice actor can do the perfect job with his voice. There are lots of new releases in this summer and I think this is a major risk in this summer. Lots of big budget movies already are showing in theaters but this movie will a very fair choice for movie goers. Lots of action and good character development will give you a good experience and typical but good story will also give you satisfaction. I think this is a very good animation movie after a long time."
99,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,5 October 2016,"Beautiful, Amazing Movie","My daughter and I have been fans of all the Laika movies so far but when we saw the trailer for this one, neither of us were very impressed - a strange looking story about a boy and two annoying sidekicks?! Those short 2 to 3 minutes didn't really sell it for us at all and we decided to give this one a miss. But, since it's release about 90% of the reviews I've read have all been singing it's praises, so I thought I might just have give it a chance. My daughter was harder to convince, but convince her I did! Boy am I glad that I didn't go with my initial instincts! First things first, the animation here is incredible. Although CGI is used to enhance some of the stop motion work, the quality and attention to detail is really blurring the lines now between this method of animation and the kind of work that somebody like Pixar produces, so hats off to everyone involved. Amazing work.The story is beautiful, dealing with family, death and the afterlife in such a touching way. There's also plenty of action and adventure and those two annoying sidekicks... definitely aren't annoying when you begin to discover who they really are.Beautiful movie, absolutely loved it."
100,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,11 September 2016,Like nothing you will have seen before,"After 12 months of trashy remakes..( Star Wars..Another Bond..D.C..Marvel..etc) this is like a breath of breath air.Brilliant old fashioned storytelling at it's best.East and West meet here in a modern telling of an old tale of overcoming the worst that life can throw at you.That said..the thing that stands out from anything is the style of animation..I have never seen anything like this before..it's as though the characters are really acting...a few scenes where no dialogue is spoken , the characters seem to tell you through emotion what they're feeling..and it really works.This will be the mark for every animation studio to look up to and copy..Pixar is outstanding in the field of animation of course but this is nothing like you will have ever seen before...visually perfect.Forget the rest of the movies for a while and get down to the theatre ..kids and adults alike..awesome storytelling!!"
101,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,4 September 2016,Severely Overlooked and Underrated,"The amount of effort that has to go into a stop-motion film is beyond that of your highest imaginings, and to think that all that effort is being cast in a shadow as other more prominent films eat up the box office profits is truly a shame. Kubo is a truly BEAUTIFUL movie, with signs of loving craftsmanship in every scene, in every character's slightest movement. The story itself is simplistic and straightforward, focusing instead on the characters themselves and giving you cause to truly care for their journey. As such, the ultimate conclusion leaves a bit to be desired, but the adventure along the way is undeniably memorable and exciting."
102,Kubo and the Two Strings,,29 August 2016,An Excellent Movie,"Kubo & the 2 strings is not only a movie but an amazing piece of art. A whole movie is a beautiful picture with touching, great story beside wonderful pictures. You will regret if you realize that you don't watch it earlier. You won't event know it's stop motion movie cause it's so nice.It's a movie from heart, that's why I believe it will touch everyone's heart whose every watch it.I have to say thank you from bottom of my heart to Laika for creating such a masterpiece of art. I can't image how do they make the whole movie with such smooth movement like this event it's stop motion movie.It will be my top 5 favorite movies all the time for sure."
103,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,28 August 2016,Beautiful animated adventure,"This is a visually beautiful movie, but I'm not sure which age group it's actually pitched at. Scary dementor type creatures, scary skeleton monster and a scary old guy. Probably too scary overall for young children. But it's a good action adventure story set in medieval Japan, with a cheeky young protagonist and a couple of unexpected sidekicks going on a quest. It may kick off a whole new origami craze too. Is it origami if scissors are involved? Definitely worth going to see if you like children's animated movies, but think twice about the age and sensitivity of children that you might take along to see it."
104,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,27 August 2016,Beautifully Told Stop-Motion Fantasy Tale,"First and foremost, I couldn't have been more wrong about stop motion animation. It is absolutely beautiful in this film. What they were able to accomplish with it is mind-blowing. It also adds a lot to the story. They could have done this with regular 3D animation, but the fact that it's stop motion adds an entirely new feel to it. There is so much more to this movie than just its stop motion animation, but it is the most impressive aspect of this film. I cannot begin to comprehend the amount of work that went into making these elaborate scenes come to life, and I have to give the filmmakers props for taking on such an audacious project. It truly is spectacular to watch...Read our full review here: http://www.themovieparadise.com/2016/08/kubo-and-two-strings-spoiler- free-review.html"
105,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,25 August 2016,"Whether you're young or old, ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is a wonderful stop-motion adventure for all","""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is the latest film from Laika, the animation company that created stop motion films like ""The Box Trolls"", and ""Coraline"". In ancient Japan, a young boy named Kubo (Art Parkinson) sings songs on the streets, and tells grand tales to passersby to make a living. He supports his sick mother (Charlize Theron), the two living in a cave by the sea. The stories he tells of a warrior fighting the evil Moon King are more than just faerie tales, and soon Kubo has adventure thrust upon him when one day he discovers the truth about his family, and the powers he has hidden inside him.Laika's latest work is a beautifully imagined adventure that handles its mature themes of family and loss without pandering to children. The characters are all colourfully developed; the stop motion animation and the Eastern settings being incredibly detailed.The journey itself is fairly standard fantasy, with Kubo having to run away from his enemies while he and his followers retrieve magic relics (a suit of armor, a sword) to help defeat forces of evil. It takes a short while to gain momentum, but once it does, the story is a delight right up until the end.The strength of ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is in the way fantasy tropes are presented - each new set-piece dazzles the imagination; deserts, caves, the ocean and ruined fortresses are all vibrantly designed and given a unique character. The same is true for the inhabitants of these places, like the birds and sea creatures, or even Kubo's companions: a talking monkey and a cursed samurai who is now a beetle (played by Matthew Mcconaughey).Good-natured humor and pathos is equally balanced in the script by Marc Haimes and Chris Butler, and the direction by Travis Knight is always exciting, especially in the action scenes that were actually pretty intense for a children's film.""Kubo"" is an excellent film that will appeal to both the young and old. I hope the film does well at the box office, so that more stop motion films can be made, especially if they're of the same quality as this picture is. ""Kubo"" is a fine alternative to lackluster live- action films in the action genre that have lost their sense of fun, as well CGI animations that are perhaps too zany for their own good.MORE REVIEWS AT MY BLOG: dynamitefilms.blogspot.com.au"
106,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,20 August 2016,Two Thumbs Up For Two Strings,"Another day, another animated adventure ready to happen, and for once it is not from Disney. Hi Robbie K here, writing another review on the latest and greatest of the silver screen. The name of the movie is Kubo and the Two strings, a stop motion project that curtails to Japanese culture. It certainly promises to be a magical experience, but as always I'm here to share some thoughts on the subject. Let's get started. LIKES:  Original and creative  Animation and design of the movie  Emotional BalanceWith all the cartoon sequels that come out, it is sometimes hard to find a new original tale to follow. Kubo breaks the mundane of sequels with a fresh new approach that will certainly stand out amongst the ranks of CGI films. The Japanese folklore theme provided a pallet of magic, combat, and monsters that are the essential components of an adventure tale. Kubo's land is filled with a bounty of story elements that will keep the intended young audience entertained. Both good and bad guys each have a certain edge, flare, or other characteristic that helps them stand out and all are integrated into the tale well. And it is all animated so beautifully! Kubo's animation and design are certainly a strong component that makes the adventure so unique. Stop motion continues to be one of my favorites, because the animators often think outside the box to bring the magic to the screen. I myself was impressed with how the world popped to life in a fantastic display of color that added to the character's personality. In addition, the world is also designed to represent the Japanese culture, but is presented in a manner that is somewhat warped to have that spooky/Gothic edge that we've loved (like in Coralline!). And when the spirit world denizens make an appearance, they get their own extra glaze to mirror their ambiance of the Moon Kingdom. If you haven't guessed, I really liked the animation and feel that it is certainly one of the more unique styles I've seen in a while. Where the animation and antics will get younger audience members invested in the film, it is the emotional punch that will catch the adult's eye. Kubo's story contains the heartstring pulling, gut wrenching moments that might just bring a tear to your eye. All the character dynamics are strongly built in this movie, much of which is designed around the importance of family and friends. Sure that is typical of any movie, but in Kubo this concept is also laced with the threat of death and how quickly those things can be snatched away. When combined with the music, the character design, and the voice actingit all comes together to really hit home. DISLIKES  The Action Component  Lackluster SolutionsIt was hard to find fault in this movie for me, but alas there are some things I felt could have been improved on. First is the action component. Yes, I am an action junky and yes I know it holds a PG rating (I'm not that dumb). Hence I will say that the action is appropriate for the intended audience with enough excitement to latch your attention, but not too much edge to cause psychological trauma. But what I wanted was for them to use their concepts more. For instance, Kubo has some pretty cool magic, but I was expecting more spectacular spells and moves from all the hype of the trailers. I was hoping for the magic to be better integrated into the combat, perhaps integrated with some sword combat to really live the battles. Unfortunately that wasn't the case as much of Kubo's exciting qualities were used for comedic relief. Oh well at least it was done tastefully and retained the artistic style I so loved. As for the lackluster solutions category, this pertains to how much of the conflict was resolved in this movie. Kubo's fights start out with edge, pick up some excitement, and then end very abruptly. With how creative the team had been with much of this movie, I was hoping to see that design carry over. But again the underutilization of magic resulted in these kind of boring, although very emotional, fixes that were dialogue heavy. This was especially true in the final fight, where Kubo was able to make a few speeches that preached the important morals like an after school special. While very important to the story, it just wasn't what I expected and was somewhat of a disappointing end game after all the set-up. Is this a big weakness? No, because like I said it was important and well integrated into the story and that is important to me. StillI was hoping for more. The VERDICTKubo of the Two Strings gets two thumbs up from this reviewer and is certainly an adventure many will enjoy. The unique design, fantastically developed characters, and bright colors are mixed together for an entertaining show with a great story to boot. Yes it lacks some of the excitement I was hoping for, but they didn't sacrifice the story quality in their editing. Based on all these qualities, this reviewer certainly recommends dropping to the theater for this one, and may even suggest catching it in 3-D should the opportunity present itself. Recommended audiences for this film are those who have kids, appreciate fantastic animation or are young at heart. My scores are: Animation/Adventure/Family: 9.0Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5"
107,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,20 August 2016,Stop Motion Animated Film - Love the Monkey,"Kubo and the two strings is the latest American 3d stop-motion fantasy motion adventure animated film. Mostly people like animated films, but specifically animation by stop-motion is quite amazing and beautiful. Kubo is one of the best film by LAIKA animation studio. This film tells the story of the young boy name Kubo, who go through various circumstances that is not required to describe. He fined himself with the Monkey and a Beetle searching for 3 very specific object that he believes, he can use to win the battle against an evil force from his past. This is a glorious beautifully animated film. This is such a well- directed movie too. Movie is thoughtful with various different themes used. Action packed extremely fun adventure film, so they can work on multiple levels. You can watch this movie as a more mature film or you can enjoy the adventure and the spectacle, because it is beautiful to look at.The voice work in the film is great, you cat praise it forever it's fantastic to look at and the action sequences are extremely fantastic. The characters are also very entertaining, the monkey especially stole the entire film. You will gonna love the Monkey, she is awesome.The film brimming with imagination, that as kids to be imaginative to use their imagination and to think beyond our own physical world that in front of us and to think about other more important things as well. This is a hugely important message for kids. Kubo and the Two Strings is such a quality film. This movie is really too good."
108,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,19 August 2016,An Excellent End to an Otherwise Miserable Summer,"A young boy is thrust into a dark world when he discovers there is more to his simple life than just taking care of his ailing mom and performing every day for the local village people. When he doesn't heed his mother's strict warning to be home before sunset, he is found by his grandfather and two wicked aunts, who have already stolen one eye from him and want the other.Kubo and the Two Strings is a magical, Far East tale that has a lot of heart at its very basic story. There isn't much that hasn't been seen before, but Laika, the production company, really puts a lot of effort into the story, making it shine far more brightly than it really has any right to. This statement is not to disparage the movie but to show what truly great characters and settings can do to even a basic story. From the start, you're drawn into the story by the movie's very first words, and very quickly you realize how important they are.The story is told flawlessly from start to finish, and the action pieces never overshadow the importance of the story. This is a movie where story comes first and foremost, and you are never left wondering why something happens. Everything that happens is important, even if it doesn't feel like it at first. Where Kubo is a master storyteller in the movie and directs his puppets as the story dictates, the same can be said for the director, Travis Knight.The stars of the movie are mostly recognizable names, but their names are quickly lost in their flawless voice work, where there are times you struggle to place a voice with the actor, which is another good thing. Even actors with typical voices that you think you can place anywhere (like Matthew McConaughey) sound different enough that you have to wonder if that's truly them. They really gave Kubo their all, and the movie is much better for it.One of the greatest aspects of Laika Entertainment is how they seamlessly use stop-motion animation for all of their films. The animation in Kubo is flawless, and while watching the movie, you have to wonder if they actually used computer animation instead of stop-motion. But they did not. Everything was made with puppets and sets, and the look is stunning. Especially when Kubo uses his shamisen to bring origami to life.And while the animation is stunning, the music is not quite stellar but it does fit perfectly with the movie. There's nothing about it that screams for you to go buy the digital download of the soundtrack, but it serves its purpose for the movie and that's all that really matters.From start to finish, Kubo grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. From one beautiful set-piece to the next, you are along for a magical journey that enraptures you, with characters that are fun and that you want to share this journey with. Sets are beautiful and unique, and the costumes are stunning to behold, as are the character designs.Kubo and the Two Strings is a movie I wasn't sure I wanted to see again instantly, but the more I thought about it after it was over and the more I think about it now, the more I realize I do want to see it again in theaters. How many more times, I'm not sure, but I think it will be a lot. The movie really captured my imagination, and it made me wish I could do stop-motion animation.Kubo and the Two Strings Final Grade: 9.6/10: A (Excellent)"
109,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,18 September 2016,Intelligent kids film,"This movie managed to do something very rare: Be engaging throughout. There was never a point where I was bored. I tend to appreciate stop-motion films more because of how much more time and effort they require. This film is visually astounding! There's a sequence with a giant (and I mean GIANT!) skeleton that's particularly impressive, especially since it wasn't CGI, but was in fact hand-crafted and operated through puppetry by someone on a ladder. Now that's dedication! The characters of the monkey and the beetle samurai were hilarious sidekicks and at times reminded me of Disney characters. I also have to applaud how original the plot was. I didn't feel like I'd seen it before. It had some twists and surprises I didn't see coming. This film is reminiscent of the best films from the Disney Renaissance era. The villains in this movie were also really great. I was disappointed they were seldom seen, because they were part of the reason the film was so interesting. I do wish they had explained the villains' motivations a little better, because I was just confused. And this film brings something that's very rare in animated films nowadays: It has complex and sometimes dark themes and doesn't talk down to kids, or try to do nothing more than distract them with pretty colors instead of trying to write a good story. This is one of the best films (animated or otherwise) of 2016. Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars"
110,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,17 September 2016,This is your quest.,"This movie was amazing. Beautiful and heartfelt. Very adult and thought provoking content. Loved that it was not all happy go lucky as most family films. We have to accept not every child has a happy go lucky life. It had my husband and I teary eyed. So happy this film is getting the live it deserves. It was a fun and lovely journey that I would gladly take again and again. The animation was amazing. The detail of just wet hands on the characters was very impressive. I hope to see many more films from this studio. Matthew M. Voice was perfect for the part and his fun loving character was prevalent to the role. I was in awe of the story telling and use of origami made it quite fun as well, not to mention looking amazing with the animation."
111,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,16 September 2016,The best stop motion animated film I have seen in a long time,"""KUBO & THE TWO STRINGS"" is a stop motion animated film directed by Travis Knight and stars Charlize Theron, Matthew Mcconaughey, Ralph Fiennes, Rooney Mara, George Takei, and Art Parkinson. Set in ancient japan lives a young boy named Kubo (Art Parkinson) who can make origami creations move under music played from his shamisen. when he accidentally brings a vengeful spirit from the past to life, he must go on a quest with Monkey (Charlize Theron) and Beetle (Matthew Mcconaughey) to defeat the creatures that lurk within his grandfather, the moon king. this movie is not only rich in lore and mythology, but it exceeds expectations in terms of story, characters, and especially animation.so what's good about this movie? starting off this review, we'll go into the voice work, because it is great. Art Parkinson plays kubo who could lend his voice to anything and it would sound interesting. he was a great choice to play a boy growing up to be a man as he continues on this quest of discovery. Charlize Theron lends her voice to Monkey who is also amazing. she can go from serious, to upbeat, to angry, to sadness so seamlessly that you just forget that charlize Theron is even there. Matthew Mcconaughey lends his voice to beetle who might just surprise you in this film. like charlize, you'll be so invested into the character that you'll forget who is behind the character's voice. he is another show stealer, again like Parkinson and Theron. Rooney Mara is creepy as the mask wearing sister #1 and #2. she can make anything sound creepy in that voice and boy does it work. the animation is breathtaking, making this film one of the coolest movies of the summer. all the technical achievements soar above and beyond the common, standard, 3d animation (although when done right, that's amazing too). like every film released from laika, the character models are done by hand. giving each character a sense of realism every time they are used on screen. but every frame put together creates a sense of wonder and imagination. every frame feels new and fresh as does laika's other films. being stop motion, it creates something truly imaginative with every size and scale topping every scene in the film. the sets that you see in the film are also hand built but they don't feel like that, much like the models. of course the film uses cgi whenever someone is flying or under water, but it works within the film. the breakout stop motion scene is when a giant skeleton (like what you saw in the trailers for the film) attacks the main characters: what's interesting about it is that there were two models- one for when the skeleton is holding the characters in it's hands, and one for some close up shots which is bigger than the other model. stuff like that is great and (like I said before) gives the film a sense of imagination due to it's incredible animation. the story is just as original and inventive. not to give anything away, but it's clever. based on the synopsis that you read early on, this film is gleaming with inventive characters, amazing action scenes, and it is all due to a great well put together story that has a message that is just as timeless as something from a recent animated film also known as ""Zootopia"". not to give the message away, but it is epic, sad, and heartwarming at the same time giving an entire purpose to each character and each layer of story told on screen. it is a beautifully told tale dealing with many serious themes that your child might not pick up on, but as soon as he or she gets older, they will appreciate it and feel just as emotional as I have felt mentally. bottom line, this film is simply amazing. not only is it my favorite film from laika, but it's also my favorite animated film, one of the best films of the year, and is also one of my favorite films of all time. parents will love it, kids will love it, I loved it, and I'm pretty sure that's about enough information I can give.GO SEE KUBO!"
112,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,4 September 2016,A Creative Masterpiece,"""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is a story about the quest of a young boy. And a monkey. And a beetle. And a piece of paper. Based on that, would I have a difficult time convincing you that it is the best film of 2016 so far?It took Laika Studios about five years to create this stop-action masterpiece, and it shows in every frame. Built on a foundation of Japanese philosophy, mythology and music, ""Kubo"" is a coming of age story, an allegory, and an inter-generational story filled with humor and beauty.Besides its beauty, it inspired me with its creativity, its artistic stylization, its sensitivity, and its ability to generate wonderment. The images are fantastic and the music is perfectly suited.It would be a mistake to reveal more about this wonderful film, but I will say that you should stay for the end credits."
113,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,29 August 2016,It's something special,"It is rare that I feel like I have seen something remarkable, special, or original. Everything that comes out seems to be a sequel, reboot, remake, or ripped straight from something else. I didn't feel this way about Kubo. I remember seeing a trailer for it as part of a survey I was taking on movies a while back. I was instantly interested in seeing it.I went with my wife and son. He's five. I expected the parts that were slow to bother him as Pete's Dragon (for example) lost his attention several times. He said, as we left, that this was best movie he'd ever seen. He was genuinely excited about it. The wife liked it and I loved it. I've been a big fan of animation since I was a wee fellow myself and I still enjoy the genre mostly in anime and the more ""adult"" stuff like what DC releases. Take from either me or the five year old that this is worth watching."
114,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,28 August 2016,"Asian movie, voiced by American actors ruined the beautiful story and graphics!","Great graphic, good plot and beautiful story. The part I hate about, is the same with many other Asian stories/movies - The Voice actors are Pure Americans! For crap sake it's Asian movie. I understand it's made to be released in the U.S. But they can at least used Asian actors who speaks English but obviously a little touch of Japanese accent to it! How hard could that be. So many talented Asian actors who can speak English clearly, clear enough to understand. Most Asian actors are bilingual. If insisting on hiring American actors, then please have them learn on how Japanese speaks. They've got to learn the language, the tone, the accent while speaking in English. Otherwise, you have an Asian looking family but speaks perfect American language. It does not coincide with the physical feature of the story. A Japanese family doesn't sound Americans. It's never been and never will. A little respect for Japanese culture goes a long way folks!"
115,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,28 August 2016,"One of the darker 2016 animated movies, also one that is Oscar worthy","Look guys, I appreciate stop motion. I've seen some shorts that feature it, mostly Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep. I even saw The Oscar nominated Shaun the Sheep movie while traveling to Paris. But I haven't seen any of Laika's movies. Not even Coraline. But when the trailers made it intriguing, I knew I was going to miss something big if I didn't go. I'm glad I did go (Note: this review will be spoiler free).The story is about Kubo, a storyteller with the ability to use two strings to animate his storytelling, who must go on a quest to find his fathers magical armor to fight his grandfather, the Moon king. Going into it, I thought it would be too similar to other action packed animated films, but I was incorrect. The story is sometimes unique, yes action packed, and entertaining. I do have one nitpick to give out, but I won't say it do to spoilers.Along with the great writing, we are brought a cast of memorable and charming characters. Kubo is a likable main character that is bright, funny, and brave. What is more interesting about him and the journey is that the journey he goes through is similar to the story he tells. The monkey (who came to life from a money charm) starts out as the impatient guardian of Kubo through his journey, but then becomes less harsh on Kubo and more caring. She was my personal favorite character due to bringing humor in her impatience and sarcasm. Bettle, who was formerly trained by Kubo's samurai father and then cursed to become a beetle, is the more dim-witted one, but is very funny and charming as well and serves some purpose to the plot. Kubo's two aunts (who are on his grandfathers side) are CREEPY beyond belief, and those two characters make it more suitable for audiences older than 6. There's a few others I won't spoil, but they bare importance to the plot as well.The animation in this movie is unbelievable. The animators took years of effort to create figures and animate them, and the effects and character movements came out so great that has just as good animation as the lego movie. It looks realistic and beautiful, and the credits are similar to Hotel Translvania where they have traditional animation. Also, the humor in the movie is really funny, and makes the movie even more enjoyable.Kubo and the two strings is a movie that I highly recommend to 8 or over. The writing is solid, the animation is beautiful, and the characters are memorable. So all I can say is go watch it. Just do it. It's a movie for kids and adults alike, and it gives Zootopia a run for its money (No pun intended, it's not getting even close to what Zootopia got in the US and Canada).9.5/10"
116,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,20 August 2016,A Beautiful Masterpiece of Artwork and Storytelling,"Kubo and the Two Strings is the latest full-length stop-animation feature by the production company Laika. Laika also made the movies Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls. I tell you the truth, Kubo and the Two Strings is a genuine masterpiece of artwork and storytelling. Coraline is also a masterpiece, but Kubo touches you emotionally even more than Coraline does.The story of Kubo is that a young boy in ancient Japan must embark on a quest to find 3 magical pieces of armor to confront a dreaded mystical enemy. I don't want to give any spoilers but suffice to say there are some emotional and clever plot twists along the way.I'm sure I'm not the only one who's frustrated with all the ""reboots"" and ""remakes"" that the movie industry is shoveling at us nowadays. The reboots and remakes are nothing more than shameless attempts by the movie industry to make a cheap buck off of the successes of older movies.If you've been waiting for the movie industry to finally offer something original and artistic, look no further than Kubo and the Two Strings. I can say without reservation that this is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever experienced, and I've seen a lot of them."
117,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,21 August 2016,Go see it!,"Kubo and The Two Strings quick review (cause I can't wait to sit down and write what I think of it)Coming to the cinema with my missus just to find out that we made the wrong date for the movie we intended to see which was ""The secret life of pets"", Kubo and The Two Strings served as a last minute backup plan. That being said we were pretty blind of what we supposed to see and let me tell you sometimes it is the best way to enjoy such a delightful and majestic animation. Plots: I won't spoil anything rather than three words: GO SEE IT! Bring your kids, younger siblings with you because this movie is downright for family. Moral lessons were being taught in natural way as if they were parts of a brilliant story told in one of the most unique kind of way. There were a few minor plot twists here and there which served enough for the unpredictability. As how some of the mechanism of magic in Kubo's world worked, the movie was pretty self-explanatory in terms of allowing the audiences to use their own imagination to interpret how things unfolded in their own ways. Visual and audio: This one is a feast for the eyes with the combination of both stop motion and CGI. Surprisingly they worked very well together as the stop-motion side brought life to the characters while CGI did a solid job at bringing effects to some of the fighting scenes. Overall the stop-motion played a majority part of bringing the spectacular of out Kubo's world and attending to even the tiniest details of each visual. About the soundtracks: There are distinctive and memorable songs everywhere. The use of Kubo's three-string guitar was smartly integrated into creating some of the most sensational sounds without overuse feelings. It made the audiences actually care and see how much emotion he put into each of his performances like each of them count for something. Overall judgement: 10/10."
118,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,20 August 2016,Beautiful and Unique Style,"This movie is absolutely beautiful. The animation is amazing. The design aspect is incredible. It had almost a darker kind of theme which why it was so unique and breathtaking. I loved many of Kubo's lines. ""If you must blink, do it now."" ""...Or the hero shall surely parish."" (Or something along the lines of that) The dialogue drew me in from the very beginning. The animating of the water was absolutely astonishing. I did expect a lot out of this film. After all, Laika makes incredible films. I love Coraline, and Paranorman. I do like Boxtrolls as well but I think many people can agree that it doesn't come close to the phenomenal story lines of the other films. Kubo and the Two Strings does fit in with Coraline and Paranorman. The ending wasn't surprising exactly but it was beautiful and fitting. I did not expect Monkey and Beatle to die, I thought they would come back to life. I also loved how the villagers stepped in to aide Kubo without hesitation. And the way that the dead came to help was awe inspiring. Amazing film, definitely living up to the legacy of Coraline and Paranorman. Amazing style. Wonderful movie."
119,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,20 August 2016,Another Great Hit from Laika,"The animation in this movie alone warrants a 10/10. It is stunning. The story is a wonderful, timeless story of love, sacrifice and adventure told with mystery, warmth and a considerable amount of humor.Kubo, a boy from whom one eye was taken when he was young, must pit himself against a cold and heartless immortal, the Moon God, and his two equally cold and cruel daughters, after a quest for several pieces of magical armor. Kubo, his monkey charm come to life, and a beetle samurai with almost no memory, are the three main characters who experience the adventure together and who learn about each other as the audience learns about them.Highly recommended, from the same great studio (Laika) that created Coraline, ParaNorman and Box Trolls, this fourth meticulously and beautifully stop-animated movie continues their growing reputation and tradition of excellence."
120,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,24 August 2016,If Japan had a Holy Bible . . .,". . . about twice as long as the American one, and if you crammed it all into a Claymation Puppet Cartoon about 90 minutes long without the credits, you'd probably wind up with something like KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS. Even though I got a full night of nine hours' sleep before viewing KUBO, I kept finding myself waking up from momentary weird dreams during this animated feature, mostly about baseball. This isn't as odd as it may sound. There's an element of repetition to baseball, whether you're watching a game in America or Japan. Baseball has nine innings, each of which starts out with no one on base and three outs to go for both teams in turn. KUBO seems to go extra innings, as it resets itself every couple minutes. A beetle pinch runs for one of KUBO's parents, a monkey bats for the other, and an infinite number of origami pages turn into virtually anything, just like your baseball scorecard boxes, which are all blank at the beginning of every game. After seeing Ichiro Suzuki break George Sisler's hallowed season hits record, is seems KUBO is gunning for Steamboat Willy's copyrights on MULAN and the rest of World Culture."
121,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,19 August 2016,The Key to How Storytelling is Done,"Travis Knight takes the director's chair under the same studio that created other stop-motion spectacles such as Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls. Except this one stands out far greater than the others, as Kubo and the Two Strings uses a classical story to make a tribute to the art of storytelling, in the form of Japanese clay puppets and the old forgotten art of origami.Never before has a story about a one-eyed lonely boy feeding his spiritually lost mother felt so captivating for a contemporary audience. This little restless wanderer takes his journey toward self-worth to a much greater level, as he treats us to a story told within a story with his origami figures, the strings of these puppets controlled by the strings of his musical instrument. Just one sound of the strum, and the paper folds itself to tell of a Moon King who takes a samurai and his family. But young Kubo is not satisfied with his life, as he longs to find his lost father, who he's been told was once a mighty warrior.All other strides taken by the animators to generate this moving picture are worth the attention of all worldwide art academies. These artists know how to fluidly combine the techniques of stop- motion animation and computer generated imagery in a way that services the artistry rather than the technicality. I am now officially won over upon the concept of combining CGI with Claymation, as everything in the frame of this feature flows and blends together seamlessly, making it impossible to tell what is CGI and what is practical. Kubo is a remarkable feat for 3D viewing.The moments of spectacle in the near-two-hour run time include a moonlit ocean wave split in half, a big scary skeleton with glowing eyes, a large underwater sea creature with a circular mouth, a sword fight with a monster from the afterlife, and two frightening looking ladies who appear merged from V for Vendetta and the twins from The Shining.With such a love toward the history of storytelling, it's a shame that the story itself needed some fine tuning here and there, particularly in the second act.After some serious drama, Kubo winds up in some other world coated in snow, a monkey there to greet him. Here is where Kubo begins to feel tonally different from how it was marketed.The next hour contains an excess of humor that for the most part falls flat. The conflict is there between the boy and the authoritative monkey, but by jokes that suggest a genre not previously established. To make it worse, Kubo and the monkey later meet with a beetle who has no memory of his past life. Almost all of his dialogue contains jokes that would get on anybody's nerves like the class clown you had in fourth grade. The voices of these two mentors to the boy are voiced by Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey, neither of which are that terribly fitting with their parts. But Theron does actually have her moment as she gets to tell a story to Kubo in the classical warm tone as told through memory. I'd also like to add that there is a plot twist involving these two figures, but it's one of those twists you could have easily guessed.This film's theme supports the belief of Buddhism, which includes reincarnation and praying to ancestors. If you, like me, are of a Christian or other religious belief, it might be offensive to you. But on the plus side, strong bonds in the feature are made between mother and son, offering children an important moral on the importance of storytelling from generation to generation.I always enjoy a good stop-motion film now and then; it's such a shame there isn't nearly enough of them being made nowadays. I think innovative forms of animation such as this one add significantly more meaning and artistry to storytelling, much more impactful than the computer animation we've gotten way too used to. Now look, I still enjoy CGI as much as the next guy, but I also enjoy a little variety.This story about stories reveals to us why we go to movies: the stories told reveal our true selves, including which ones appeal to us and which ones we choose to tell. Stories, especially in movie format, live on past our own lives through constant retellings."
122,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,18 August 2016,Magical boy in medieval Japan,"A magical and tragic movie about a boy with magical powers as he goes on a quest for his father's sword and armor he needs to defeat Raiden the moon king. Laika Studios has done it again. First there was Coraline and ParaNorman. Now this film that takes place in medieval Japan. Probably the best film of the year. I thought stop motion animation was highly detailed and colorful. I was a fan of Laika Studios' Coraline and ParaNorman and I'm interested in medieval Japanese history during the Sengoku Jidai (Japan's Civil War). So that is what brought me to watch this movie's premiere in theaters. To top the film off, I thought the end credit music sung by Regina Spektor's take on George Harrison's ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" was pretty good."
123,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,20 August 2016,"Storyline is good, some animation glitches","The movie ""Kubo"" is an OK movie. Without going into details that might give away the movie, I found the story-line was pretty good, but predictable. It felt that there was some repeated content, but just in different details. I also noticed for the scenes that show Kubo walking at a distance, Kubo's legs kind of jump around (stutter). I understand that the studio is not a big name like DreamWorks or Pixar, but they have a 3d version that I feel might have sacrificed the quality of the animation. The majority of the people will not catch it though. Also, being a Christian, I would not watch it again, since there are Asian religious beliefs in the movie. Would I recommend it? Not for young kids, as a few scenes are violent, but for older people, if they want to go to a movie and nothing else seems like a good option."
124,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,7 July 2017,Excellent Film!,"""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is one of the best animated films I have ever seen. Period. Wonderful characters, comedy that maintains throughout without going overboard, and very meaningful themes propel this to the top of my best of list. But the real joy is the most obvious attribute; the beautiful stop motion animation. I was curious about the making of the film, so I watched some behind-the-scenes time lapse videos. Unbelievable, truly. The precision to make these moves so believable, and so heartwarming is more than I can even comprehend. I have seen stop motion films in the past. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a holiday favorite, for both Christmas and Halloween. But this film was something different. I was completely pulled in by the pageantry, and the attention to ancient Japanese proverbs was a home run. I have very few negative comments. In fact, I don't think I have any. Do yourself a favor, watch the film and enjoy watching young Kubo finish a quest started by his late father. You won't regret it!"
125,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,4 July 2017,A masterpiece of animated story telling with lovable characters and a beautiful world,"Laika's latest animation, Kubo and the Two Strings, further proves their credibility with a beautifully crafted world of full of endless imagination and matches its own animation with a thrilling adventure full of fantasy, myth, and surprisingly melancholy, as well as a small batch of great and lovable characters and a premise that will remain timeless and provide pleasure to viewers of all ages."
126,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,3 July 2017,A beautiful and heartful and great story,"Combining a touching story, heartfelt performances and gorgeous, often idiosyncratic animation, Kubo & The Two Strings is one of the best animated movies ever not to have the words Disney, Pixar or Ghibli attached to them. Unfortunately overshadowed by flicks like Moana and Zootopia when it came to award season, it just as much fun as these films are, but is easily far more audacious. The action scenes are genuinely tense, and had me actively hoping the heroes would come out on top, and at times it looks like this might not happen. It's not a typical kid's movie, with some pretty heavy emotionality and themes of loss and grief, but it's done with positive intentions and isn't patronising or inappropriate. It has something for all ages, and deserves just as much praise and attention as the films put out by the aforementioned animated juggernauts.Kubo And The Two Strings takes the typical 'Hero's Journey' to another level in this epic adventure that tells a fascinating story through captivating animation and a beautiful score. The movie transcends far beyond anything ever done in an animated film; it's almost on a Middle- Earth scope as far as fantasies go. It's also entertaining for audiences of all ages and an instant family classic.Beautiful movie with heaps of comedy. Loved the stop-motion and story."
127,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,27 June 2017,An absolutely great movie but a bit too predictable,"I am in love with this movie. It was cool, interesting, funny and had emotion. The characters were very individual, the story simple to follow, the places interesting and cool and the fights not too drawn out.While I don't think that a movie needs to be completely unpredictable to be good I think this movie was a tad bit too predictable. (SPOILERS ahead... obviously. Why read reviews if you haven't seen the movie?) I also think that the movie could have been a bit more drawn out. It is 1h40min but still feels a bit short a full 2h would most likely do it. It not being too long can however be good for rewatchability. I wish they could have used the extra time to have more of a reconnection between that father and the rest of the family as I was interested in him beyond how he was as a beetle.The movie however ended just how I wanted it too. Bittersweet."
128,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,26 June 2017,"Kubo and the two Strings, Honest Review","Title: Kubo and the Two Strings Director: Travis Knight Genre: Animation, Adventure Family Rating: PG Leads: Charlize Theron, Art Parkinson, Matthew McConaughey Here we go again! This was a random pick from last night. If you were to ask me if I would have ever chose to watch this movie over something else, I would have said no. Just based on the look and title, it isn't something that would really draw you in. That being said I was pleasantly surprised with this movie! The movie 1 hour and 41 minutes long (101 minutes) Which on the surface seems long for an animated movie to me. The animation style is different, going for a more Asian theme, which fits this movie well. It isn't something I am usually a fan of in feature films but it works. This movie has some very well known voice actors that I wasn't;t even aware of until I looked them up. Some have very small roles but it is cool to see big name stars voicing a movie like this. You have Charlize Theron playing the Monkey, Matthew McConaughey playing the Beetle, as the big two. Other notable names in short roles are George Takei as Hosato, Roony Mara voicing The Sisters, and Ralph Fiennes as the Moon King.On to the plot! This movie is based around a small child, who is caring for his mother in a cave like structure. They were ship wrecked after fleeing her family. Her father and two sisters took her son's (Kubo) eye, and killed his father. Her father being the Moon King, Kubo isn't allowed outside after dark, for fear that they will find him and take his other eye. Kubo is a great story teller in the small village close by. He uses his guitar and paper to create wonderful visuals to go along with his stories, but always has to cut his stories short due to the day ending. He never gets to finish his stories and leaves everyone hanging. One night an old women tells Kubo how he can communicate with the dead, so he tries to contact his father. In doing so he stays out after dark and that is when the movie starts getting good. Up until this point the movie is pretty slow and almost makes you not want to watch over an hour more. But I promise it gets better! The Sisters start chasing Kubo and the story takes off. With the help of his Monkey charm, the Beetle, and his mom's left over magic he begins his quest. All of which is laid out in the movie, but I don't want to ruin anything.This movie has a different animation style than most other feature length animated movies. At first I wasn't't sure I would like it the whole time, but it fits well. The story goes into pretty good detail and the movie gets pretty deep. Which you may not expect from a movie like this. I think this movie really sets it self apart from other movies in similar genres. If you remember from my last review, I said that movies in these categories go up against the greats. they have to have something special to stand out and shine above the others. I think this movie does just that. You get a real sense of caring, and compassion when watching this movie. You quickly want certain things to happen, and everything to play out well for the main characters. This movie has conflict, high points, low points, and over all a great story line with great actors. his movie is a pretty complete package.To sum it all up I would recommend this movie to everyone. It has themes that would keep children entertained and is interesting enough to keep the adults in the room satisfied! The acting is great, the story is great, and there isn't much more to say."
129,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,25 June 2017,Excellent animation movie,"This is a really beautiful and good movie. The story has been taken in very nice way. The movie was very different from other animation movies. The story was approached in an attractive manner. A mother saving her son from her father and sisters who wants her son's eyes. This movie is well-worth to watch even twice. I would say this is one of the best animated movie mixed with emotions, magic, adventure and action."
130,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,9 June 2017,Steve's Film Page on Facebook,"Another resounding success from Laika. The company known for its brilliant stop-motion has now shown true mastery over the art. Laika, also known for its deep, complex thematic elements, does not disappoint with Kubo. The duality in this film is powerful, its presence superseding any issues of predictability. A brooding fantasy, dominated by harsh realities, that takes your soul and returns it brighter. Life and death, mother and father, sun and moon, all explored and intertwined through visuals that seize you without distracting. Humorous, dark, loving, and most of all, real. Flawed, but a step closer to perfection from a company I will continue to keep one eye on. Top 300 film. 8.5/10  ￼watching Kubo and the Two Strings."
131,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,29 May 2017,Fantastic Story and Animation,"Just watched this today and all I can say is wow! From the get go, the audience is drawn into the story, which the writers did masterfully: they gave us hints to what the story was about but left us hanging! This isn't your typical ""animation"" feature film...it is so much more! I am middle-aged and I absolutely adored this movie because of the rich story, the incredible imagination of the writers, and the attention to detail the studio took to immerse us into a great tale and keep it going throughout. The actors were all spot on and I was chuckling a lot! I highly recommend this gem."
132,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,21 May 2017,"If You Must Blink, Do It Now!","This movie in the technical aspects is perfect but in the story maybe not that much.It tells the story a young boy named Kubo who must locate a magical suit of armour worn by his late father in order to defeat a vengeful spirit from the past, who is chasing him across all the country. The story is well written and keeps you entertained along the whole movie duration but there are some parts I didn't understand at all. Why the grandfather wants to kill him? Why his mother feels like under a curse? This small things don't bother that much but for movie felt like a bit unexplained. The story is not that hard to follow so it keeps you entertained in the hour and a half or so that the movie lasts. The characters are well introduced and the main trio is very funny. Kubo is portrayed by Art Parkinson who did a great job and Charlize Theron did the voice of the Monke but I specially loved Matthew McConaughey as the Bettle and Ralph Fiennes as the Moon King, they both did a great job.But the greatest part of this movie is the animation. All the animations of the characters, the creatures, the landscapes and even the origami figures are done with such a lovely care that is a joy to look at. All this amazing visuals with a beautiful music created by Dario Marianelli helped this movie a lot, that would be worse if we only had the story.This is a very entertaining movie that you can watch with kids or just alone, it doesn't matter because you will probably enjoy it a lot."
133,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,18 May 2017,A very good animation movie of 2016.,"In this story a little boy named, Kubo's eye was taken by his mother' sisters and they seek to get his other eye. His mother saves him by using her magical guitar. Somehow the boy's aunts find him so, now the boy should find three things- unbreakable sword, an armor and a helmet. It is a very good animation movie. I recommend this movie to all."
134,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,5 May 2017,The Cult Animation of 2016,There's no need to say how the film industry gone too far on animation. On this movie we can see again. You can feel the Far-Easts atmosphere and feel like you are really there. This movie satisfied for 8 - 12 years old.But looks like the other age groups not satisfied on this movie.
135,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,1 May 2017,A tale that is both visually and emotionally fantastic.,"When ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" began, I realized I was in for a treat. The fourth film made by Laika Entertainment, the studio that also released the dark and twisted ""Coraline"", charms and delights in this story that feels like an old Japanese tale that has been passed down years and years through generations of children. However, this story isn't anything you've heard before, it's original. Entirely original that it pays off. Well, for the most part. But, I'll get to that when I get to that.The film opens up with seven chilling words, ""If you must blink, do it now."" The story tells of a boy named Kubo (Art Parkinson). He lives with his mother outside a village where he performs tales about his late great father Hanzo on his magic shamisen using origami which comes to life and moves to the music. However, he cannot stay out past sundown as he is hiding from the boy's grandfather, the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes), who has stolen one of his eyes and is looking for his other. One day, though, Kubo forgets about his mother's warning to stay out, and his found by his two very disturbing and creepy aunts (Rooney Mara). Using the last of her magic, Kubo's mother uses the last of her magic to get the boy away to safety while also using his snow monkey charm to come to life and protect him from the evil aunts. So, Kubo and Monkey (Charlize Theron) along with a beetle (Matthew McConaughey) set out to find the missing pieces of Hanzo's magic armor and to stop the evil Moon King and his two daughters.The film is the debut film of the CEO of the company Travis Knight and I'm amazed by what he did for his first big project. The animation is gorgeous. When it needs to look beautiful, it looks beautiful and when it needs to look dark, it looks dark. It's a visual marvel, probably one of the best looking stop motion movies I have ever seen in my life. I also really liked the characters. I really like the relationship that Kubo has with the monkey which I feel is genuine. The two aunts are probably some of the creepiest villains I have seen in animated movie in a long, long time. They both wear these disturbing masks in which you can't see their face at all and Mara's creepy voice seals the deal. However, I did have a hard time getting into McConaughey's character as the beetle. He's trying to be the comic relief of the story, but I just couldn't get into his performance because the story was felt serious and adult and didn't need a comic relief. It was a little tough. And now, let's get to the story, which is really incredible. I enjoyed the chilling nature of the tale, and really loved the fight scenes that happen with the the two aunts and the monkey. However, what holds the movie from being perfect is the last third. I'll try my best not to give anything away because this was a major problem. While the first two thirds are incredible and I really enjoyed watching them, but after a certain plot twist happens when the crew needs to find one of the pieces of armor, the film slowly started to slip away. The editing got very odd as the scenes just quickly moved on and they didn't stop to let the audience breathe the atmosphere in the movie. I wasn't a very big fan of Fiennes' character either. While I thought his backstory was understandable, I just didn't him finding creepy or disturbing as the two aunts which is strange considering he's played many villains before in the past like Lord Voldemort. Also, the film didn't give us an ending, it just stopped. I don't know if that was the intent or not, but it just made me feel empty. It was a major disappointment for me.However, I still found ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" incredible. The animation, the characters, and the first two-thirds of the story are probably enough to keep me coming back. It's a real marvel. While I sadly fear, that film might become underrated in a few years, I hope that many people see this incredible film sometime in their life. It's really something to enjoy. If you haven't seen it, definitely check it out. You won't be disappointed."
136,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,28 April 2017,Outstanding,"This was the most moving and magical animated feature I have seen in years. I've seen all the Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks etc. CGI films and feel that this stands head and shoulders above their recent releases.Using stop motion animation and some CGI, Kubo creates a world that is at once real and fantastic. It has a solid feel to its wondrous and imaginative landscapes that 100% CGI movies still can't quite capture. The story is heartfelt and told without pandering to small children, yet they will still be able to enjoy it, unless their senses have become too deadened by the hyperactive antics found in so many of today's animated films geared toward them. The filmmakers don't soften some of the scary images and situations as we often see in today's PC productions that seem to believe that small kids will be traumatized by a frightening moment in a film.This is a film that the whole family can enjoy."
137,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,22 April 2017,The Duality of Life and Death,"First off, I love Laika, ParaNorman and Coraline are beautiful movies with amazing messages of self-respect and responsibility, and also forgiveness. Much like Laika's previous works, this is a darker movie, dealing with death, aging, and the fear of being forgotten and forgetting your loved ones. Storytelling-wise, it's very simplistic, a hero's journey in 3 acts: the motivation, the adventure, and the goal. It's more sardonic, humor-wise, and some people didn't appreciate that; it's not forced comedy, it's comedy in light of a struggle. It's clues and hints to the truth. It's literally a hero's tale about a hero's tale, so of course, you have these ""cliche"" stepping stones, but for me, I felt like the mastery of the backgrounds and characters, you get this look at an old idea about an old tale made in a new, vibrant way.Yes, there's clichés, but it makes sense that Beetle and Monkey act the way they do considering who they are, so I don't find fault in that because that's a specific choice by the creators. And yes, the ending is very much ""here's the message again, for those in the back,"" and there's nothing wrong with that.Overall, I gave it a 10 out of 10, because it's beautiful, has a real message, and perfectly represents the hero's journey presented as a folk tale, and that's amazing."
138,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,16 April 2017,"Wow!... simply, wow!","I rented this as a co-feature in case the other movie turned out to be a dud. This is some of the most exquisitely beautiful and sophisticated animation I've ever seen, and I'm saying this as a 56-year-old lifetime animation fan. The trailers just don't do any justice, if you went by them you'd think this is just another ""me-too"" straight-to-video to compete with Moana. You'd have no idea what you were missing.It's a unique and distinctive stop-motion that often looks and feels - and MOVES - like top- quality CGI.The first time I saw it, it was with my jaw agape, wondering ""HOW did they DO this?!""I initially was convinced it WAS CGI, but started wondering why the hair was so ropy and some textures were so realistic while others were so UNrealistic. And bonus features showed physical models and puppetry, Technically, this movie is astounding, and I would recommend viewing the bonus features and YouTube videos for specifics. That's what I did, and I was so impressed I went ahead and bought it on Blu-RayThe production design and attention to detail is spectacular, as is the authenticity to historical Japanese culture and samurai lore. The background and some effects are CGI, but the integration is often so seamless you can't tell where one stops and the other takes over. And yet with all the realism of stop animation and CGI, NOTHING in this movie is photorealistic. They don't try to make miniatures look like the real thing, which not only showcases the artistry, but also makes a few TRULY SCARY MONSTERS a little easier to view without screaming and sh*tting your pants (I's saying this to the adult viewers, not the kids)The storytelling is a bit heavy-handed and derivative, with a little Disneyesque schmaltz, but certainly not a distraction. A wonderful, often catchy supporting music soundtrack helps pull you along.After seeing this masterpiece, I'm DEFINITELY looking into other Laika Entertainment productions."
139,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,11 April 2017,Kubo and The Two Strings: This movie is one of my favorites now,"Lets see how do I put this... OH yea this stop motion animation is one of my top favorites to have ever witnessed in my 20 years here on earth! The story behind this story is well written and the way stop motion has progressed in recent years has made this film be at its very best. I was sadden that I could not see it on the big screen but as soon as I got on Netflix I was excited it was there so I watched it for the very first time and I enjoyed every scene and exploring every detail in the film. I have never heard of Travis Knight whom directed this film and the only way I ever heard and seen of this film was from a YouTuber who is friends with one of the film makers and that was what got me engaged with the film as that the YouTuber was promoting the film on one of his videos. Which if you would like to search that up the YouTube is Actionmovie Kid. The characters in the film were outstanding and it was funny when monkey and beetle would argue in an adult like humor for the young ones, older kids, and adults would understand. Once Beetle started speaking I quickly figured out who was playing him in which it was Mathew McCaughey! And he did one good job of presenting the character and you could clearly identify the actor if you have seen his other films such as Interstellar which by the way is a must see film. It was hard for me to see errors in the film and it got me thinking on life and the understanding of what brings a family close to one another in even the worst circumstance. Either way I thought the director did a good job but the other films he has done like ParaNorman which I have seen was really good. Overall, this film was worth watching and I am considering buying it digitally like on Googleplay or Mircrosoft."
140,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,11 April 2017,What can be said that hasn't already?,"Truly, what can I say? I was already a fan of Laika Studios through Coraline so my hopes for this film were high. I was not disappointed. Combined with similarly beautiful storytelling and visuals, Kubo and The Two Strings is a masterful feast for any movie lover. Filled with heart, emotional scores, humor, and exceptional attention to detail via the filmmakers, Kubo is a true treasure. While the film may not be good for the very young, since it may not hold their attention and some scenes may even scare them, older children and adults alike will surely enjoy this movie many times over. Having just seen it, I'm sorely tempted to watch it again."
141,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,8 April 2017,"Sumptuous, thrilling, emotional - classic Japanese folklore","Can't believe Kubo got beat out by Zootopia for best animated feature at the 2017 Academy Awards? Zootopia was awesome but come on people, this film took over 5 years to make. It's visually stunning and incredibly emotional. I'm sitting here in tears just thinking about it. You will need to watch it twice just to catch everything that is going on, not to mention listen to the director's commentary just to catch even more of the classic Japanese culture and symbolism that went into making it. Kids, respect and cherish your parents because they love you and they won't be around forever. Parents, hug your kids like it's the last time you will ever see them because it all goes by so fast."
142,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,2 April 2017,Beautifully crafted good animated movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Kubo and the Two Strings"" (2016) is a very beautifully looking animated movie, which tells a good if sometimes a bit to hard to understand story. I loved the look of this movie - it does look absolutely beautiful. The pacing of this story was very good, or at least for the first hour or so, but then by the end it started to drag a little bit for me. Nevertheless, ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is a good movie for whole family - it isn't all the action and adventures as in other animated movies, this one is a little bit more mature.Overall, ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is good animated movie. It isn't groundbreaking new or original or great, but it does what it intends to do - to tell a story for a whole family, a little bit more mature story then in many other animated movies and does this in a very beautifully crafted movie."
143,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,27 March 2017,A Rousing Animated Adventure Story,"A visually inventive animated film about a young boy and his quest to find the tools he needs to defend himself against a family who wants him to follow their destructive path.The messages in ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" aren't necessarily anything we haven't seen before -- things like parents' protective love for their children, appreciating the beauty of the world rather than fearing its hardships -- but they're framed by an exciting and involving adventure story with terrific voice work from recognizable actors like Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, and Ralph Fiennes. I particularly appreciated what the film had to say about people who are so fearful of the world as it is that they end up destroying all of the wonderful things about it without ever realizing that they are wonderful in the first place.Nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Animated Feature Film and Best Visual Effects, a nomination that puzzled me until I saw a brief clip that plays over the end credits and shows how the film was made.Grade: A"
144,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,4 March 2017,Beautiful,"This is my first ever review on a movie, I just want to say that this is a very beautiful movie and very well done. I have four boys (currently 9, 7, 4, and 2) and we decided to watch this movie for our ""movie night"" our youngest fell asleep pretty early but that was fine. This movie held the attention of all of us for the duration of the movie, my 4 yr old said ""it was a little scary, but I liked it"" my 7 year old says ""it was good, it actually was good"" and our oldest said ""IT WAS AWESOME!!!!"" This movie will definitely be one that we as a family will enjoy again and again. For me personally it was fun listening to all the voices and figuring out who it was doing the voice."
145,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,2 March 2017,What should be the true essence of humanity?,"What would be the true essence of humanity?Kubo's story begins to answer that question.The moon and sun have been at war since before words were written down. You would think that a theme as old as humanity itself would get tired and played out, you would think that but it is not the case. To be hunted from birth creates a character that is jaded, feral and stubborn but Kubo is none of these. He is soft-spoken, kind, and true, a storyteller with a propensity for love that knows no limits. He is stronger than a brain.Though writers over time have produced lazy approaches to the idea of duality. Those who have created this incredible stop motion picture focused less on the details and more on the emotions that build from the theme of life and death.Happiness is a shroud donned by the reaper of souls.The end will make you see light in the shadows."
146,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,1 March 2017,Very good stop motion animated film,Kubo and the two strings is a 2016 stop motion animated film which is produced by the same people who brought us Coraline and Paranorman and tells the story of a young boy who must find a magic armor by teaming up with a talking monkey and a bettleman.But will Kubo kill the sisters who killed his father?. Overall the animation was beautiful and the voice cast was good from Charlize Theron to Matthew McConaghey.I love the twists in this film where the monkey and the bettleman have something in common with Kubo...im not giving too much away but i like kubo.
147,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,27 February 2017,Kubo and the Two Strings - Fiction Fanatic,"Fiction Fanatic is a review series I'd eventually like to see on YouTube. However, until then, I'll do them here! Let's begin:Kubo and the Two Strings is a 2016 Stop-Motion animated movie by Laika Entertainment. It's about an incredibly gifted little kid named Kubo who has exceptional music and storytelling skills. I watched it a couple days ago at my house and absolutely loved it! The animation is stunning and the voice acting is stellar. It features the voice talents of Matthew Maconahey (I don't know how to spell his last name, don't judge me) among others (I can't think of anybody else, don't judge me). I could've sworn the Monkey was voiced by Scarlett Johansson, but I guess I'm wrong. Oh, well. I'll live. Forwarning: I'm not good at writing reviews.The story is original and is beautifully told. There's funny moments, heartwarming moments, everything you could want! I'm a sucker for Stop- Motion, and this is one of the best ones I've seen! If you haven't seen Kubo yet, please, please do! I highly recommend it!Nine out of Ten!"
148,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,22 February 2017,An experience that is dazzling for kids and adults,"We have all had the experience of watching animated movies. If it's a Disney movie you go in with high hopes knowing you will be enchanted and dazzled with superb music scores written by the very best. If it's a Dream-works movie you know it's a bit of a risk, they made great movies like ""Kung Fu Panda"" or ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"", but then had some real stinkers like ""Home"" and their most recent blockbuster ""Trolls"". Then you get movies like ""Kubo and The Two Strings"" which may be the riskiest experience. Coming from the company who made the superb ""Coraline"" and the thrilling ""Paranorman"" you'd think Kubo would be set up to be successful. My worry going in was that this movie wouldn't be able to find the balance of appealing to younger audiences or older audiences. But this movie did the exact opposite, in fact it excelled, anyone who watches this movie will discover a new favorite experience. ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" follows the journey of Kubo, played by Art Parkinson (the Walking Dead) who has a mysterious skill that he inherited from his mother. After a hard loss, Kubo meets a monkey named monkey, played by Charlize Theron (Mad Max: Fury Road) and he meets a beetle, and you guessed it, he's named beetle, played by Matthew McConaughey (Interstellar and about half of all of the chick flicks ever made.) This cast is full of talent, and they give all of these clay created characters life. I like to compare this movie to a painting. Often, paintings start with an Idea (crazy, I know.) Then when you are writing out your idea, you have new ones. Somehow, artists know how to seamlessly weave all their dreams and hopes into art. Kubo, to the core, is a movie about a boy on a treasure hunt. There is so much more depth to it though. The first thing to mention is the visual effects. Already nominated for an Oscar, Kubo excels at making a new universe from the little that we see. Second, is the score. Much of this movie's soundtrack is based off the song ""While my guitar gently weeps."" I love seeing how movie's, this one especially, can stretch and bend an original song. If they want a scene to be intense they can add more strings and increase the speed, in contrast, when they want a emotional scene (which they do, a lot) they slow down the music's tempo appropriately, so that your feel goods can feel good. Kubo is one of the best movies of the year. It makes you feel things that have probably been dormant inside of you. If you want to cry, laugh, smile, and leave happy, you should at least give ""Kubo and The Two Strings"" a chance."
149,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,21 February 2017,"Awesome animation, great storytelling","Kubo is a young one-eyed boy who has special magic powers that allows him to make and control origami paper. That may seem confusing, but it is very useful in telling stories. He takes care of his mother, who has her own powers.He eventually sets out on an adventure with a statue of a monkey brought to life by his mother. He must find three pieces of magical armor in order to stop his vengeful grandfather from taking his other eye.Overall, it's an amazing accomplishment from Laika. It's not quite as good as Zootopia, but it is definitely a good movie."
150,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,21 February 2017,A cinematic masterpiece for the Asian folklore admirers,"If you must blink, do it now. This animated film is amazing for several different factors but mostly for it's background story that most of people that give bad review fail to understand. The story reflects upon the mistakes we do in life, the important impact they have on others and how life changing forgiveness can be. Kubo and his mother, escape from his mother's cruel family that cursed her for marrying a mortal man. Kubo's grandfather, a once man that turned into evil, took Kubo's eye in order to make him blind into people hearts and memories. While they think they are safe, their evil family gets back on their tracks and the only way for Kubo to be safe is to locate a three piece invincible armor. The story is truly a tenfold into Japanese folklore and the way Kubo uses his narrating powers through origami is fantastically beautiful. There isn't really one single thing i did not like about the film. And the Japanese rendition of 'My guitar gently weeps' at the ending titles was a huge cherry on top of a delicious cake. 10 thumbs up."
151,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,17 February 2017,Laika Deserves the Oscar This Year,"I can't tell you how happy I am after watching Laika's latest offering- Kubo and the Two Strings. It is without an iota of doubt, one of the best films of 2016. Laika has come a far way since Coraline. Despite having difficulties in turning their movies into profits, Laika is still around and making films. This is good because there are very few people who still work with stop-motion. It's very tough to make a stop motion film as it requires patience and hard-work. Most of the studios do not bother about it as they have CGI to do their job. As a result, stop-motion is almost non-existent.Laika is different though. With Kubo and the Two Strings, they are trying to tell you that the art of stop-motion is not dead and they are the flag bearers when it comes to making such films. This film sets the bar for stop motion even higher. It feels like a CG animated film. So much hard-work has gone into making this film. Lets talk about the film now.First of all, I would say that this film is more suitable for adults (like most of Laika's films) than children. Children may get scared because some of the parts are very dark and scary. In fact, I got scared during many scenes. The film begins with the following lines. ""If you must blink, do it now. Pay careful attention to everything you see and hear, no matter how unusual it may seem. And please be warned. If you fidget, if you look away, if you forget any part of what I tell you, even for an instant, then our hero will surely perish"" The opening lines are enough to give you a hint of what's coming. It sets the dark tone of the film. As if these lines were not enough to chill you to the bones, the film starts with a night sky, a full moon, thunderstorms, heavy rains and a tumultuous sea. In the midst of all this, we see a woman on a boat trying to cross the sea and take her infant to safety. She uses the magic to defeat the waves but gets hit on the head by a rock. She is swept off to the sand and we get to see a glimpse of the infant (Kubo).Fast forward a few years and we see that Kubo has grown up and takes care of his mother who is not well. He lives in a village and earns the bread by performing with his magical origami and instrument. One day, he accidentally summons two spirits from the past. These spirits are of his aunts from his mother's side. Now, I must warn you that these twisted sisters are the scariest part of the film. When an animated film is able to scare you, you know the animator has done a great job. To defeat the spirits, Kubo must find three things. The rest of the film is about that. But there is much more than just thatKubo and the Two Strings works on many levels. It does lose some of the charm in the third act but the bucolic setting and dazzling animation make up for it. Honestly, I would have given it a solid 10 but the third act is a bit, lets just say  underwhelming. Overall, Kubo and the two strings is one of the best movies of the year. I seriously wish this film takes home the Best Animated Picture Oscar. It has got a great story, good voice acting and eye-popping animation. But I know, Zootopia will give it a very tough competition. No matter which film wins, I just hope Laika keeps doing what they do best- keep making such awesome flicks."
152,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,15 February 2017,"Kubo and the Two Strings, a great journey in Stop Motion","I wasn't going to see this movie because it didn't give me the attention to me. But my brother who is a Laika fan, he begged me to see it with him. So, i saw this with my mom and my brother, and i really enjoy it. This is by far the best Laika movie that i saw, twice. The writing of this movie is really brilliant and the dialog is mostly good or memorable. The characters are all likable and some of them are funny like the three main protagonists. The villains are most scary and interesting. The movie also has a lot of funny moments, especially with Beetle or Monkey. All the voice actors makes a great job even they aren't Chinese or Japanese people. Like Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey and Ralph Fiennes. The animation is fantastic, every detail or character design is just phenomenal. The score is also fantastic and the Japanese culture is fantastic and they don't modernize nothing. My only problem is the defeat of the villain, The King Moon. Which the scene i feel a little bit fast like Trumper's defeat of Shaun the Sheep Movie. I don't know if it was the writing or the edition, but it was something that i feel fast of that. But overall, Kubo and the Two Strings is a fantastic film. I wasn't expected to say that but Kubo even is not the Best Animated Film of this year, i think is the second best and the Best of Laika which give us.9.6/10"
153,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,6 February 2017,"An Amazing Story, But In A Sad Way","From the start of Kubo And the Two Strings, when I saw face of the first movie character, also the movie's protagonist, Kubo's mother, I felt the drawing style was quite unnatural. It reminds me of artistic drawing style from ancient China I saw in art class, I believe it's also a classic Japanese painting style, since that's where the story begins.The way the art goes in this movie which is weird because of its unfamiliarity in today's animation trend, doesn't stop making this movie good, actually it's one of the special reasons that make this movie so special when I am now recalling the overall feeling it gave me. That feeling is what makes this movie so memorable to me. It's a story of a child, trapped in an unbreathable paper box, he is suffocating, but not give it up, he breaks out, and what he sees is the setting sun, the lightness gone... that's where the story ends Yes, an analogy of this movie, the tune Kubo And the Two Strings gave me from the start of watching to the end, when you break out of the box, fresh air breathed in, yet unable to keep your heart lightened.Depressed, because the darkness is almost coming, but not really, because you can still see the fading sunshine, so the guitar in your arms, still gently weeps...An amazing story, but in a sad way..."
154,Kubo and the Two Strings,,4 February 2017,Kubo and The Two Strings is a Great Movie,"I love stop-motion movie and I just love how the movie kept on progressing that made me still interested towards the end. But the movie does has some negatives that I must point out however, it's still a great movie.This movie is really suited for all age groups because you can think of it in a child perspective and an adult perspective. What enjoyed about the movie the most is the way they made Kubo characters continue to progress of what's happening in his life. I also love the parallel in the movie that were actually happening to become to real for him like Monkey and the Beatles.The story line of the story seems like you had already seen it before but it still felt original. If I would recommend anybody a great stop-motion movie it would probably be Kubo and the Two Strings. The only problem I have worth this movie is the antagonist motive because it wasn't quite clear enough for me and it felt like they just threw in the antagonist in the movie just to put some worthy action in it. But overall this was a great movie that purely enjoyed."
155,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,3 February 2017,A deliciously made adventure,"I only discovered this movie because of a friend who very randomly talked to me about, and I'm glad he did, it's for sure a must watch! My love for this will be eternal since the very first second I started watching it. Why? The visuals are amazing, fantastic, creative and breathtaking. We are in a year where a stop motion movie is so delicious that I might even cry if it wins something cause it truly deserves.The plot is very very fun and adventurous, and Kubo is a great boy with a even greater mission... The end is kinda heartbreaking but yet so pretty that you get happiness running through your veins.And remember: if you must blink. do it now."
156,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,2 February 2017,"Entrancing, aesthetic, and noble, some small issues poke through.","Welcome to the feudal era of Japanese folklore: a world of samurai, 'yokai' demons, spirits, and music that can summon magic.The premise is familiar, a grand quest for magic objects, but not the kind that can 'save the planet' or some other hyperbolic function. These are magic objects that are of personal importance to our protagonist. It is decisions like this that are much of what make Kubo an honourable movie. It doesn't resort to gross exaggeration of any kind simply to make it more kid friendly. There is humour to be found but it is strictly, and appropriately refined.Without being anime, Kuno maintains much of what makes Japan beautiful as depicted by its animation industry. Above all else, the masterful crafting of evening sunlight which is almost a Japanese signature is ever present in Kubo. Lighting is a compliment to what may be the films strongest aspect, which is its landscape. From the size of a tidal wave to the vibrant colour of a maple leaf, much of Kubo looks lifted out of a Hokusai print.Kubo dips into swordplay on occasion but when it does, it honours another, more questionable Japanese tradition. If you are an anime connoisseur, you will most certain appreciate the feeling of displacement from watching the expository and even intelligent conversations that characters too often have when in mid duel. Kubo does not quite rise above this, and uses its action scenes as places for the antagonists to explain themselves. And yet for all the dialogue in these scenes, the biggest conundrum of Kubo, is that the 'bad guys' motives never actually seem clear. As for Kubo himself, a pre-pubescent minstrel who tells storys with his shamisen and magic origami (flying paper animals) he is everything that the movie needs from such a character. He is a child with an adult brain. The story doesn't ask anything of him that is beyond our ability to swallow, until the climax which renders him in a suit of armour.The character undergoes his journey in search of what will allow him a life of peace. He comes out at the end, a little stronger much not drastically different from what he was at the beginning. The ending is strong however because it is small, and reminds us more about what has been lost then gained. I encourage Kubo as a family movie, not because it is more entertaining than most but because it is smarter and better made."
157,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,25 January 2017,"Great Movie, disappointing ending","I think this is one of the best animated movies I have watched. I love the plot and the animation. My score showcases my disappointment with the final battle. Kubo spends the whole movie trying to find the pieces of the armor, but when he obtains them, they are not useful at all. The armors do not do anything special, and the grandpa can get the armor off from Kubo easily. I expected the armor to give more magical powers to Kubo so that he could become as strong as his grandfather, but it was not the case.I think Kubo's mother sisters were more powerful and provided a better fight than the grandpa. The grandfather was supposed to be the strongest, but he did not do much damage compared to his daughters."
158,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,24 January 2017,Absolutely wonderful,"First off, I'm amazed this is stop motion. I actually had no idea when I was watching it until the credits, where they show it off a little. (Apparently, they used 3D printers and other software to achieve this level of stop motion animation.) I'm in awe.But of course it's not the technical achievement that makes a movie. What makes a movie like this is the gorgeous visual appeal, the terrific acting (especially by Charlize Theron), the touching, engaging screenplay, the characters, and the sense of magic appearing before us.This is at times quite dark, although leavened with humor, but it manages to keep away from being depressing, giving a sense of wonder and possibility to even the most melancholy scenes.Anyway, terrific movie, you should watch it."
159,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,20 January 2017,Underrated film GO SEE IT,"This is the 4th film from the company that brought us Coraline, the Boxtrolls, and ParaNorman. Claymation is an underrated art and under-appreciated art. I feel like the general audience aren't interested in this art and that's sad. This film is AMAZING. This is a story about a kid named Kubo who is living in hiding from his family because they want to turn Kubo blind. Kubo goes on an adventure with his magical powers and his companions to obtain items to defeat his family once and for all. This film does a great job on portraying the Japanese culture which allows us to connect to the characters with our own family morals. The music in the film works well and the themes of the film Hit Home! This is truly an amazing film and if you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favor and do so and you may need tissues. I give Kubo a 9.6/10. This was hands down my favorite animated film of 2016."
160,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,20 January 2017,The craft on display here is staggering,"The word beautiful comes to mind when I think of ""Kubo and the Two Strings"", not just in the animation but also the story. Laika Entertainment has that art style that took me a little bit to get used to (the characters have a wood-carved look that I'm never really grabbed me) and I think that's worth mentioning because there's plenty here to help overcome that. Just the imagery of an origami Samurai shows off the incredible action staging and sense of movement (seriously, you don't expect to be so charmed by a paper swordsman, but that happens here).But it's also a tale steeped in Japanese folklore and full of family secrets and narrative twists. This plays on pretty much every emotion; and it's easy to write that off as callous manipulation, but there is some serious heart to this movie. 8/10"
161,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,17 January 2017,"A good animation, uses Stop-Motion amazing","Kubo and the Two Strings is a very well done animation, it uses Stop- Motion very well, it's impressive some scenes, the soundtrack is very good, the characters are good, but I do not find them memorable, the cast that makes the voice Of the characters is excellent, Charlize Theron, Art Parkinson, Ralph Phiennes, Rooney Mara, Matthew McConaughey, George Takei, and etc, all do a great job, have great times, good dialogues, the script is good, Kubo and the Two Strings is a good movie, even though it is not the best animation of the film. Year in my opinion, deserves at least an indication to Oscar of better animation. Note 7.8"
162,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,16 January 2017,Kubos! This Animation's Got Strings,"Kevinyou're two-for-two with SOLID back-to-back best of the year film choices that most haven't even seen, or even heard of. But, I blindly take your word for it and haven't been let down.Let's just begin with: Kubo and the Two Strings BETTER win the Oscar for Best Animated category plus Best Song for ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps."" I wouldn't be opposed to this winning overall best picture, but we know they don't do that. Sadly.This movie was absolutely amazing. From story, to visuals, to creativity, to score, to (again) song, to jokesthis feels timeless and I just saw it for the first time. While the script and ideas aren't 100% fresh, it felt like a new breath of fresh air on an old fable. Basically, a single mother is rightfully overprotective of her child, Kubo, but he disobeys her and the dark forces she was trying to protect him from find them. In a story he thought he was either making up or retelling, he begins to live it in order to eventually confront his stalkers. I just gave the absolute gist of the story since it's best you just experience it for yourself. While the movie feels a tad Disney-inspired with some slapstick sidekicks, it makes it its own and correctly never lingers on the jokes that truly made me laugh out loud more than a few times. It knew it wasn't another company's and kept to the universe it beautifully created.While it's out there  I'm guessing this is a Studio Laika trademark since this is only my third film I've seen of theirs  it stays enough grounded for viewers to understand the film's mystical realm and rules. And while some themes are a little more adult and others dark, it's good enough for kids, just not too young. Adults, like myself, can marvel at a movie that we would've loved as a kid.It's certainly a movie not to be missed, especially for its fun adventure, comedic timing/lines and story beyond just animation. Relive your childhood here and take a wild trip in one of the best movies of the year.***Final thoughts: Kevin, I mentioned above, announces his top three best of the year on his final ""Fat Guys at the Movies"" podcast/radio show of the year. And each year I immediately go to that movie I've either heard about, but haven't seen or see it completely cold just because of his recommendation. In the past two years, he's been spot on: 2015's incredible Sicario and now, 2016's Kubo and the Two Strings. Both completely worth checking out, much like Kevin's awesome podcast. Look for his show online and you won't be disappointed either."
163,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,15 January 2017,Beautiful kids movie,Kubo has amazing presentation of a kids story. It's very clear on this right from the start. Our narrator is untrustworthy drawing inspiration from the many tales he's been told. You will know 90% of the story before the halfway mark. But the journey is the fun part.Kubo is very direct in it's symbolism. TheJapanese mother who tells stories of the western inspired father. The story of how he took her from here father who was blind to the world. But through the combination of western and Japanese art the her father is able to see the world. But only once the smoke of fear cast by the selfish daughters is cleared.That's about the deepest and least direct symbolism I got out the movie. Everything else is spelled out for the kids to understand. The monkey and beetle being the father and mother was told to you in case you didn't notice the major gifts from the mother and father being a monkey statue and a robe with a beetle on it.The character development is also lacking. Everyone has one motivation that isn't supported by much more than that's what they exist for.Kubo reminds me a lot of Life of Pi. Great presentation with very direct explanation of symbolism. If it left more up to the audience to notice I would give it another star and if it had a tiny bit more character development it would be a perfect score.
164,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,14 January 2017,Shamisen shaman and a story about the power of story-telling,"Saw this a while ago with my boys and their 8th grade friends. Probably the last ""kids"" movie we will see, but a word about that.I wonder if any younger kids might have trouble with this, not necessarily the scary perils of the adventure, although definitely many very young kids would find that frightening. But the air of morbidity, well that's a bit harsh, but a serious contemplation of death might be a bit tricky. It's not Jack Skellington at play here, or any of the cute aspects that Tim Burdon and others can make into plush toys. It feels more philosophical, so I wonder if younger kids (elementary school) might find it sailing by them.At the same time, the animation is fantastic and the music even better. Plus there's plenty of comedic relief channeled through some character incarnations. I'm just not sure if younger kids will appreciate a story about the power of story-telling.Ah, maybe I'm short-changing the short-stuffs out there. I would say for my non-breeder friends, this is certainly not (just?) a kid's movie.As for the darker side of the dark side, I wonder if any parents took their kids to this film to help subconsciously wage war with interfering in-laws (grandpa and two aunts are enemies)."
165,Kubo and the Two Strings,4,11 January 2017,"Not a fan of it, but still well made.","Jesus Christ this is a boring movie. I could barely watch it, and I didn't like the story. I could tell that this movie was well made, but this still is a boring movie. In short, is this a good movie? Yes. Is it an exciting movie? Not in my opinion. Should you watch it? I would not suggest it, but then again I don't suggest drugs yet millions of people beg to differ. I can't believe how much money I spent on this movie, it was not worth it in my eyes. Also another thing to note is that my kids did not enjoy this movie either, and they have really low standards. Maybe I'm just being a bit nit picky because I am a movie critic and I have watched too many good movies to appreciate this. Or maybe it's just a boring movie. Yes, I know I am not a professional critic, just a critic in my small crappy town here in Aussie. Never visit Darwin Australia, terrible place."
166,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,11 January 2017,Great Stop-motion,"This movie is very well done in my opinion. First of all the combination of Stop-Motion and the regular animation was brilliant, was outstanding and very enjoyable to watch. Personally, I love this kinds of movies, but I am sure that even if you don't, you will enjoy this one. The casting was a very nice combination of actors. Screenplay was beautiful, it shows the values of family, also the customs and tradition in Japan; in involves action, love, comedy, sadness, fear, and fantasy (just the perfect combination). The dialogue was brilliant, a very developed one, told in a a sophisticated but at the same time in a humble way. The origami was magnificent, and a very beautiful and artistic way to tell stories. The whole story is very pretty. This movie is one of a kind. The director made a wonderful job, the characters of course and their own stories, makes you fall in love with it. Laika's animation was incredible! 9.0/10"
167,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,4 January 2017,Enchanted Stories,"Visually spectacular, with original compositions and perfect visual effects, Kubo and the Two Strings has an interesting, symbolic, complex and almost gloomy plot that develops the script of a beautiful way, creating charismatic characters (in particular a truly hero, whose audience pray unconditionally) and an inspiring message (special in this days, when the art of the transmit tales are practically gone). The musical part and the voice overs are excellent, and the role develops in your and correct time. Incredibly and really emotional, with his good doses of humor, this movie fills the heart with much and several loves."
168,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,3 January 2017,The Mona Lisa of animation in 2016,"I was most excited for this movie, since the animation is amazing. I watched it and could not even tell if it was stop motion or computer animation. Well, it was a mix, but the animation was so smooth, it was amazing. Another thing that made me think it was computer animated was that it was water, an enemy in stop motion. One thing I liked was how it was based on a Japanese legend. Now, I am a FAN of Japanese culture and stories. Art Parkinson is a great actor, starring in the famed HBO classic (it should be CONSIDERED a classic) Game of Thrones. In Japan,-Kubo gap, the average spacing between consecutive energy levels Kantō kubō, the ruler of the Kantō region during the early Muromachi period in Japan -Suō-Kubo Station, on the Gantoku Line in Kudamatsu, Yamaguchi, JapanTWO THUMBS UP!"
169,Kubo and the Two Strings,,2 January 2017,Passionate Filmmaking & Dextrous Craftsmanship At Its Best,"The fourth feature film by Laika Entertainment, LLC is a stunning example of handcrafted magic from the famed studio that beautifully balances its rich, colourful fable with adult-oriented themes, action-packed extravaganza & jaw-dropping stop-motion animation to finish as another enriching, enthralling & exquisite delight for viewers of all ages that entertains, enlightens & rewards in more ways than one.Kubo and the Two Strings tells the story of its titular character, a young boy with one eye who lives with his mother in an isolated cave atop a mountain and spends his daytime entertaining the local crowd at a nearby village through his magical shamisen & magical origami. But when he fails to make it home on time one evening, a chain of events are set in motion that sends him on a quest to fulfil his destiny & confront his fate.Directed by Travis Knight, the CEO of Laika Studios, in what is his directional debut, Kubo and the Two Strings opens with a brief prologue & a clever monologue that offers its viewers a peek of the world that's waiting ahead and a mindset required to fully grasp it. The first act takes its time to pave the necessary groundwork and Knight's composed direction exhibits all the hallmarks of a budding filmmaker as he expertly handles all the aspects and makes them work harmoniously.The script borrows heavily from Japanese cultures & folktales yet brims with an originality of its own, not to mention that it provides complete arcs to its characters. The theme of duality keeps surfacing throughout the picture but despite its grim tone & morbid elements, it never hesitates to indulge in some lighthearted moments whenever an opportunity strikes. Also, be it the character interaction, their individual stories or the chemistry between them, it only gets better with time.From the technical standpoint, Kubo and the Two Strings is nothing short of an extraordinary feat. The images are rich in colours & textures, the stop-motion animation is absolutely dazzling, plus there are numerous grand set pieces that give viewers a sense of the daunting task the animators undertook to render those complex sequences with such effectiveness. The wisely chosen camera angles, wide range of colour palette & fluid movements do contribute in enhancing its drama and do so in a very subtle manner.Editing allows the story to unfold at its own pace but it may not go well with everyone as its final act does feel a tad too stretched, even if it culminates on a fitting note. The background score is absorbing and always in tune with the transpiring events. The voice cast consists of Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Rooney Mara & Ralph Fiennes, each playing their part to near-perfection, with Theron, McConaughey & Mara impressing the most in their respective roles of Monkey, Beetle & the evil Sisters.On an overall scale, Kubo and the Two Strings is a thrilling amalgamation of a deeply fascinating mythology, smart storytelling, mature themes, interesting character arcs, clever wit, outstanding voice-work & unparalleled stop-motion wizardry, and isn't just arguably the best animated film to surface on silver screen in 2016 but is well worthy of a spot amongst the finest films of its year. A labour of love, passion, vision, imagination & handcrafted creativity, Kubo and the Two Strings is passionate filmmaking & dextrous craftsmanship at its best. Highly recommended."
170,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,30 December 2016,A film that you need to watch,Kubo and the Two Strings is a fantastic animated film about a young boy who has these magical abilities and uses them to tell stories to the town. One day his evil aunts return to take Kubo's other eye away from him and bring him with them to his grandfather's side. And so the boy ends up on the run being chased them. While on the run he meets a Monkey and a Beetle who join him on his journey. The animation in this film is so cool looking and freaky as well. The animation is so fluid and very well translates the story from scene to scene in a very cool and very inventive way that I really liked. The way the stop motion worked really drew me in to the direction of the film and made it more interesting. I also really liked the action pieces in this film. I have always been a fan of Japanese animation and everything about this film feels very ancient Japan. The sword fights are cool to see and so are the battles within the film as well. Everything about the action I thought was very well done and just pulled me more into the film. I also thought the performances were really good as you couldn't even tell the voices were who they turned out to be. They all sounded so different from how these actors normally sound like and that was something that I just found to be really interesting as well. it was a really neat way of doing voice work. Overall I would highly recommend Kubo. It is kinda sucky that such a well made film made so little at the box office. Still though it is a really strong film that I think can really captivate you from start to finish.
171,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,29 December 2016,One of the best Animated Films of 2016,"A young boy named Kubo must locate a magical suit of armor worn by his late father in order to defeat a vengeful spirit from the past. I just finished watching Kubo and the Two Strings and my god this film was terrific let me start with the good first the voice cast was amazing Charlize Theron as the Monkey and Matthew McConaughey as the Beetle were by far my 2 favorite characters in this film alongside Kubo of course but overall everyone was great in this movie it might be sound easy because it's just a voice but it's not. The action was handled very well and so did the humor especially from Beetle. This is also a very good looking movie and it reminded me a lot of Samurai Jack both in style and tone. This film right here blows both Zootopia and Finding Dory out of the water it had great written characters, a very good story and a lot of humor and action that both kids and adults can enjoy and i'm gonna give it an A+ too bad that it didn't make a lot of money at the Box Office it was really good..."
172,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,18 December 2016,"A smooth, colorful, emotional fairy-tale in Chinese background...","Kubo and the Two Strings... this is one of the best stop motion animation movies I have seen till date. There are multiple instances in the movie that seems to be inspired from the Harry Potter story such as Kubo on the quest for the three magical items like the Deathly Hallow, the mix up of parents from human and magical world, on top of that Ralph Fiennes as the voice of the Kubo's arch enemy and so on. Its an overall delight for the animation loving viewer's eyes to see this colorful magical emotional story within a Chinese background depiction. The background music is soothing esp. the song in the end credit scene 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' is mesmerizing. With the voice credits of the stars like Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey and Ralph Fiennes, this flick is a must watch. Thumbs Up!!"
173,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,16 December 2016,Great but with Some Complications,"Kubo and the Two Strings is an exciting, funny, musical animated movie. I very much enjoyed it. It's one of those great movies that could have been just a little better for me though.This review is all about the few places I saw fault in it, and how it could have been better. I figure the whole world seems to be praising it so of what value is just another doting review? I did give it a very high rating though, I'm just focusing on what I saw that could have been improved upon. Where it lost points with me was with a convoluted, somewhat boring quest story and an ending that left me shaking my head. Still, families and animation lovers are bound to love this film. It is doing amazingly well with the critics and audiences. IMDb gives the synopsis as such:A young boy named Kubo must locate a magical suit of armor worn by his late father in order to defeat a vengeful spirit from the past.The bastard/orphan character type has tugged at audience heartstrings for centuries. We saw it in Oliver and Annie and most recently in the character of Harry Potter. It's sad when a kid has to make a way for her/himself in a cold world. That's why we empathize. Sometimes the catharsis is in the tragedy and other times in the child's discovery of her/his parents and subsequent elation. Kubo is sort of like that, but he does have a mother who's slowly losing her mind.Kubo's tale is an exciting one. I especially like how he plays a Japanese instrument that resembles a guitar. His guitar has magic origami powers and that is amazing to watch. The crowds he plays for won't let him leave until he shows them the end of the story. It's clever how he shifts from telling these tales in the town square, with some awesome panatonic scale music, to taking on a quest in real life where he actually uses some of the tricks he shared with the dancing, enraptured audience in the square.I liked this film. I didn't love it like so many others are. I felt the story moved around a lot and it was hard to keep track of what was going on. Wen we got backstory it was in intermittent bits and we never really get the full story about the villains. It's a folktale though and this genre is passed down through generations by campfire and the like. In theory, a folk tale doesn't need a lot of backstory.The stop action animation was really great but to be honest, the movie could have scrapped it and it would have been no more or less effective. It's a great story that spins out on itself so the animation gets obsolete to the audience about 1/2 way through, kind of like 3D. I know the incredible work it takes to make a stop action film such as this and the creators have my respect. Still, I though the story could have been whittled down to a more palatable story board and then I could have marveled more at the animation. Lots of times critics say that avaunt garde animation movies lack a good story. It's as if the director pushed the story so far out there in fear of that happening that he overdid it and the animation gets a bit lost in the far too complicated story.I highly recommend this film to families and animation fans. It could have been better with a simpler story and I have a distinct problem with the ending but I won't get into that here in the interest of avoiding spoilers. If you want to discuss it in the comments, by all means just ask."
174,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,13 December 2016,a top-drawer white elephant,"A stop-motion animation from Laika studios, their 4th film (started with an unconventional oddity CORALINE 2009), KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS is the director debut of Laika's CEO Travis Knight, a metaphorical fairy-tale taps into the Japanese culture and engages a Westernalized appropriation in its character development, yet the combination might seems too unorthodox to its potential demography, which may explain its shortfall in its box office receipts. First and foremost, the film is a sturdy testimony that stop-motion method has officially been on a par with CGI animation if not exceeding the latter in its all technicality, which is a great news since diversity should be embraced in very aspects of our lives, it is so bracing to know that we have multiple options to create animated fantasies, being hooked up in front of a computer screen is one way, and making models and props, then photographing them in small increments can achieve the same effect. The story-line has a coherent oriental philosophy as its undertow, Kubo (Parkinson), an one-eyed mongrel child borne out of a forbidden union of his heavenly mother and earthing father (a tale similar to the Chinese folklore LOTUS LANTERN), has to embark on a journey to looking for three pieces of his father's armor, after both parents die protecting him from the claws of his evil grandfather Moon King (Fiennes), en route, he is shepherded by his surrogate parents, a charm- turned-monkey (Theron) and an amnesiac samurai cursed into the body of a beetle (McConaughey), yes, don't ask how and why, it is a realm of magic and occult, just surrender to it, as in Kubo's kaleidoscopic origami superpower. Strikingly impressive set pieces come consecutively, the animatronics behind a skill giant is especially enthralling, and the three-step quest ends in a poignant note where Kubo unites with his parents only to lose both afterwards, follows by the showdown which discards the golden armor and sharp sword, instead, an aggregate power of a nuclear family, which refers to its title Kubo and the two strings (each is snatched from one of his parents), can trump the almighty inhuman sovereign, and finishes the story with a kid-glove treatment that humanity prevails immortality. There are massively appealing sequences with its quaint and beguiling aesthetics, a refreshing tack which strongly distinguishes the film from other Hollywood commodities, but one might find the juxtaposition not so organic, especially to those who has an oriental background, because the main characters are designed according to an American frame-of-mind, e.g. the over-familiar trope of an over-protective mother-figure bickering with a free-wheeling father archetype, it adds some comic relief, but also belies the story's Japanese background and betrays a commercial-oriented sense of not alienating its core audience, which, as a matter of fact, doesn't work very well because overall, the style is not congruous enough to achieve a required catharsis. ""You are my quest"" is the tenet of this masterful stop-motion feature, we are encouraged to embrace the challenge of a journey but not solely dwells on its destination or outcome, more importantly it is the journey, the quest itself, that really matters to the formation of our own personality, that's rather neat, only next time, the honcho of Laika must secure a more balanced tonality before green-light a project, otherwise, it will continue its hapless streak as a top-drawer white elephant which a substantial monetary gain often ruefully eludes."
175,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,10 December 2016,Animated film of the year?,"Not knowing much about this film before I sat down to see it, I did not really have many expectations at all, but ""Kubo and the two strings"" really, really impressed me.Not wanting to go to much into the plot of this movie, because there is a description of the movie in IMDb's article; This movie is an epic animated adventure of a little boy and his friends,First of all, it is absolutely beautifully animated. Took me a couple of minutes getting used to, as there are not many other movies animated in this style. However, especially in certain scenes the animation is just amazing. The plot of the movie is also very original, with a good mix of humoristic, and serious characters. Exceptional voice acting from almost the entire main cast (Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Ralp Finnes), however my favorite was definitely Matthew McConaughey's ""Beetle"".An epic, highly original adventures to anyone who will put 1h, and 40 minutes for watching this film. Definitely worth the was, and is absolutely a film I will see again. Animated feature film of the year?9/10 movie 10/10 will watch again"
176,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,5 December 2016,Cute Movie but extremely depressing end...,"I thought the animation was amazing! It kind of reminds me of James and The Giant Peach in many different ways. The story was very whimsical and full of amazing characters! I could see myself as a kid really enjoying this movie. This is when the ""but"" comes in. The ending is so terribly sad to me. Hopefully I'm not the only one that feels way. He gets reunited with his mother and father only for them to die! Then he is left to take care of his Grandfather who killed his parents but is now senile and suffers from an extreme memory loss. Despite the ending I would not say this movie should not be watched. I just feel like the movie could have been one of the best animated movies to come out in a long time but just fell short."
177,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,3 December 2016,Kubo and the two strings is one of the best stop-motion animation movie ever made,"KATTS is an adventure stop-motion picture that tells a journey of kubo to find the three piece of armor to beat his enemies which are his aunties and grandpa. As the journey begins, he meets some colleagues such as a monkey and a beetle. The three piece armor itself are not easy to obtain. Kubo need to face its protector such as giant skeleton and one eyed monster. When the last armor found, then comes the time when he need to face his hardest enemy, his grandpa, a moon king.The coolest thing from KATTS is it just a stop-motion, but real contender at awards, maybe Oscar for best picture of the year too. This movie is a huge leap not just from stop- motion, but also for a movie. It has an original story and screenplay, fairy tale story structure with beautiful color composition.The color composition is so vibrant and modern. I like how the director compose blue, black, and white to create such a beautiful night with moonlight. While he compose a good proportion of orange to create dusty set place in the early duration. Some screenplay also worth to be stated amazing. Voice cast also did a great job. From all aspect, KATTS is above average.You will not get bored witnessing a journey of Kubo til the end. This movie will keeps you surprise and erupt you as the story untold. This is the potential how an adventure animation genre film could be. Don't blink !"
178,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,25 November 2016,wonderful,"Kubo is an one-eyed boy in feudal Japan who tells stories in his village. He returns to his mother every night who warns him never to stay out after dark. An old villager tells him about a lantern festival where they communicate with the dead at night. Kubo stays to talk to his father but he's attacked by two spirits. His mother uses the last of her magic to save him. She sends him on a quest to find his father's armor and gives him monkey as his guardian. They are joined by Beetle who is an amnesic samurai in the form of a beetle.Laika continues to do its own special style of stop-motion animation. Their blend of physical and computer animation is getting better and becoming a trademark look of its own. It is simply wonderful and it enhances the magical theme of the movie. I love the mystery of the story, the visual, the magic, and the design of the characters. The only problem I have is Monkey's voice. I understand the use of Charlize Theron but her voice sounds wrong for a monkey. The connection with his mother would work perfectly fine without using the same voice. It's a minor annoyance which doesn't take away from the wonder of it all."
179,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,25 November 2016,A wonderful directorial debut by Travis Knight,"It's unfortunate that stop motion animation isn't getting as much attention as CGI animation when it comes to the mainstream audiences. But there is a lot of passion that goes into this craft. Because if the project lacks the passion and patience or else it will miss the mark when it comes to the emotive. So the focus to details is very necessary when it comes to stop motion animation. Now I enjoy animated films by Laika and I want this company to succeed and keep making more stop motion films. So I highly recommend you check out ""Kubo and the Two String"". This film is full of wonder, emotions and a inspirational message about overcoming loss and how memories and love flourishes. This is a amazing film, but I can see how it won't be a huge success. Because animated films needs it to be family focused for it to be a box office hit in most cases. While kids can sit through this film, it felt like it was aimed more for young adults and elders. Because with more life experiences, you can empathize and understand where Kubo is coming from. For a animated film that the whole family can watch, it's actually quite deep. Some may claim ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" isn't fully stop motion animated. But the intrinsic way it flows and the little attention to details makes it not matter in the least. This is a wonderful directorial debut by Travis Knight. Now, I am a viewer that enjoys anime. And this is probably one of my favorite American made, once-shot stop motion animated movie that felt like a anime adventure.8.2/10"
180,Kubo and the Two Strings,,25 November 2016,An adventure for children,"This animated film tells the story of a young Japanese boy who has to take care of his ailing mother. He is also an amazing story teller, who has the power to conjure origami alive. He embarks on a journey for hidden treasures to defeat the spirits who killed his mother.""Kubo and the Two Strings"" tells a fantasy story that a boy with magical powers can defeat the scariest monsters and spirits. It is an empowering film that reminds people that everything is possible, when you put your heart into something. The monkey provides many very funny one liners, and the people who wrote these jokes deserves praise. The story is an adventure for children, but adults might find it not too exciting. It is a good sign that Hollywood makes an animation based on Japanese characters, setting and story. Though the behaviour and speeches of the characters are heavily Americanised, it is still great to see that Hollywood is embracing diversity."
181,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,24 November 2016,"A boy, a monkey and a giant beetle team up for a quest.","This is not an old fashioned stop-motion animation. This is a very modern, a hybrid of multiple techniques that includes 3D printing and digital special effects. The directional debut for the producer of 'ParaNorman' and 'The Boxtrolls'. The tale is about a one eyed boy named Kubo, who has been hiding in a seaside mountain cave near a small village from his grandfather, the moon king, ever since his birth, protected by his mother. He grew up listening the stories of a legendary samurai warrior Hanzo. But one day after he himself exposed to the moonlight, the troubles follow. Now his only chance to survive is to find his father's armours and so the quest begins where he teams up with other two.This is a Japanese story, takes place somewhere in a fictional ancient Japan. Technically, this film was so good, very pleasant for viewing, especially the framerate was higher than normal stop-motion animation. The character models, music, the length of the film, the pace of the narration, all were so brilliant, but not the story. It was average, I mean very, very simple and familiar. Still, it is a very likable film, particularly the children would love it. I'm going to repeat again like I always say while reviewing stop-motion animation films that this kind of films are rare, so when they make one, that automatically goes to a must see list. Whether you're going to like it or not, I hope you won't miss it.7/10"
182,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,24 November 2016,Beautiful Visuals Accompanied by Fun Characters and a Painfully Forced Ending,"Kubo and the Two Strings follows a boy called Kubo who, after experiencing more than one family tragedy, must set out on a journey to find a suit of armor and sword that will protect him from the evil man hunting him down. The way the premise is presented is really cool. For the most part, it's a regular fantasy story, but the way it presents itself with weird, oddly specific instances that are better left unspoiled is really intriguing. Certain aspects are unexpected simply because of how weird they are, yet they fit in with this otherwise generic fantasy story. Of course, the animation is great. It's a beautiful-looking movie for sure, and it often sets out to prove that and test the abilities of clay-mation. The action sequences are intense, and frankly a lot of fun to watch. Whenever one started I had to adjust myself so as to get in a better position to see them, and I think that means something if the second swords appear tension appears. They made me rather giddy, but moreover I'm glad they were spaced out in the way that they were. If it was loaded with awesome action sequences then I think they'd lose a bit of flair. Having only a few was a good decision. Also, the soundtrack. I really enjoyed listening to the music throughout the movie, as it complimented it really well. And similar to the action, the music was spaced out, specifically the music Kubo played. So whenever he did pick up his banjo-thing it was something to look forward to, and simply a treat to listen to. And the movie is just funny a lot of the time. Little lines thrown in here and there. Not every joke soared, but for the most part they were a nice addition to the film. The characters were a lot of fun, but furthermore I cared about them. They all had good chemistry with each other and became very easy to care about. So when tragedy befell them in the form of some conflict or fight, it was all the more engaging because I was invested. The way the movie is written goes up and down. Sometimes it was really good. It avoided cliché lines and plot elements like the plague sometimes, but others it indulged itself in completely. It was largely a generic story, presented in a mostly generic way, with some unexpected twists and turns throughout. I didn't have much problem with the way the story was presented, but it was still kind of generic. As for the ending, I wasn't sure about it. I was getting excited for an awesome final fight, but what I got was some generic speech that broke the tension completely and suddenly made the movie hard to watch. As the ending progressed I started to get used to it, but it still was so out of place. It was painfully (and messily) farted out the director's butt, and it really brought the movie down a notch. Overall Kubo and the Two Strings is a really solid movie, with plenty going for it and a bad ending. If not for the ending, I would have given it a stronger rating than what I gave it now. But regardless, it's a solid movie that I'd definitely watch again. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie."
183,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,23 November 2016,597th Review - Oscar Contending Animation,"Kubo is an exceptional film - it takes a non-patronizing theme of loss, and like Song of the Sea, refuses to spoon feed its audience. This is a film all ages can enjoy - from younger children, who will love its sense of adventure and style, to older kids and beyond, who will resonate with its deeper themes. It goes for simplicity in its straightforward appeal yet hides complexity in its nod to Pure Lands Buddhism, Shintoism, Origami as Zen, and other Eastern mysticism, while also touching on the central themes of the Western literary tradition of magical realism. This is a film with many layers and many ideas - yet has a cohesion - with the central idea of a child coping with loss - that any child can understand.On top of this very good abstract base, it has great action, a good plot and story line, and good characterization - the time zips along.The animation is simply stunning - the use of puppetry and sets is so different from both Disney and Pixar that we almost balk at the idea, but those who have seen ParaNorman or Coraline from the same studio, Laika, this is refined and simply breathtaking in places. The animation is complex, beguiling, and very engaging. Travis Knight, as director, does a great job at pulling together the piece in a very cohesive whole.It certainly should be among the contenders for the 2017 Oscar - we all preferred it, ourselves, to Finding Dory - Kubo is a wonderful story about stories and storytelling as memory, and in the current era, where disposable is seen as optimal, to be given time to reflect on why memories and stories matter as connecting us is very powerful."
184,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,4 November 2016,7/10,"Kubo (Art Parkison), a young, one-eyed boy living in a small village in a fairy-tale-like Asian land, embarks on a journey with Monkey (Charlize Theron) and Beetle (Matthew McConaughey) to find an ancient sword, helmet and armour in order to defeat his aunts and grandfather whom have become cold evil spirits, seeking Kubo's second eye and to whom Kubo's mother turned against in the past.Having in the past not thoroughly enjoyed Laika's past efforts like ""Paranorman"" and ""The Boxtrolls"" (for story reasons), ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" comes in as a definite improvement on them, with a far more touching narrative which adds a brilliant tribute to Asian cinema, even though some of the story problems I had in the past still emerge from this animated beauty.I think no one in their right mind would argue the beauty of what unfolds on screen and I have never done so with Laika's features. The fact is that this isn't simply beautiful animation, this is Pixar quality visuals, the frame does not feel limited, it just explodes with richness in detail and color, giving every single picture an overwhelming beauty which always is there to serve story: there isn't unwarranted visual extravaganza, nor silly gags inserted to keep the kids awake, every frame is thought out to serve story and homage both Asian live action and animated cinema. Moreover, when we are served gags and comedy, they are worked brilliantly into the picture. Overall this is simply one of the most beautiful canvases I have seen on the silver screen, especially because of the evocative animation which truly goes to touch emotional chords and isn't spectacular just for the sake of it.Similarly touching are some of the story elements introduced by the narrative and in equal measure the way in which they are brought to life. The story most definitely has a fairy tale structure and it manages to do some interesting things with the medium. The family intrigue brings a variety of different emotions and themes to the table in the likes of motherhood, loneliness, lost-love, growing up and a poignant spin on the hero's adventure. The design of the characters is incredibly rich and the two aunts in the film were probably the biggest highlight of it: they were legitimately scary and their spectral presence was just a delightfully spooky touch which really brought to the forefront the fantastic art direction this film can boast. And finally, the icing on the cake here was a magnificent score which just as the animation and the characters, homages Asian culture in the perfect measure making it very nostalgic and gut wrenching at times, yet fitting the emotional beats of the story wonderfully.Where unfortunately some of this incredible magic is lost is in the narrative for me. Whilst the majority of the story beats work, almost none of the plot is fluent. Whilst I get the poetic license one can use to move along in a fairy-tale, I found this too be way blown out of proportion. The plot just takes wild steps in every direction and by that many of the stakes are lowered and many of the emotional beats, especially in the ending, loose a lot of gravitas even thought they bear a touching message. It is a pity because a lot of the film suffers from lowered stakes and emotion because of this, leaving the pleasure of the experience more on an aesthetic level rather than an emotional one. Anyways, what ultimately matters is that Laika has produced a diverse film, with unique touches and characters which ultimately left me with a satisfying experience."
185,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,28 October 2016,Power of visual story telling,"For those of you who grew up watching Pingu and Chicken Run, Kubo and the two strings will bring back sweet memories. Kubo pushes the stop- motion category to a completely new level. For the uninitiated, stop- motion is like watching a puppet-show without strings  its a whole world of miniature figurines which are moved slowly to capture incremental changes in motion through the camera. Considering your usual CGI-animation, stop-motion is way more work and sweat. It is Travis Knight's directorial venture (CEO of Laika, the production house and son of owner of Laika, Phil Knight) and he creates a powerful story, pushing boundaries like never before in stop-motion.First reviewed on broth of blogsPlot and Script (P&S)It is clear that Knight has taken inspiration from legendary film makers like Akira Kurosawa and others. Kubo is a simple enough story set in the samurai land and feels like a folklore that we all have heard. The innocent boy, the hero, who sets on a quest to avenge his father's death with his two friends  Monkey and Beetle without realizing that they are his parents, well almost. The Moon King, Kubo's grandfather, loses his daughter to Hanzo (Kubo's father) and the king and his other two daughters set out to kill Kubo's family. What follows is an epic battle of an under-dog and a powerful nemesis, shown in the most beautiful way.I am a big fan of animation and love the really creative concepts that are shown in animation. From a vegetarian shark (Shark Tale) to providing electricity with a child's screams/laughs (Monster's Inc) are all concepts that have really shown that each animated movie is just another powerful story to be told. That is my only little issue with Kubo  it seems like a very simple story and not too innovative. But considering the limitation they had with this format, I can't complain too much.Characterization and Acting (C&A)I really liked the characters. There was magic in each one of them, like literally. The monkey (Charlize Theron) and the beetle (Matthew McConaughey) were just awesome and their chemistry, brilliant. The evil sisters, voiced by Roony Mara were perfect  dark witches who are so evil that they won't spare even their sister's son. The moon king, who was the ultimate villain was a little anti-climactic for me, I expected him to be a little more sinister and his objective of killing the family a little more evil. But other than that, all characters did their part and added to the magic of the story.Here are some images from behind the scenes and the intricate details of how the characters were made in miniature.Sounds and Effects (S&E)The music is so melancholic, it draws you in. I loved the string play that Kubo does every once in a while, really feels like you are in the story. Can't say much here, I liked it all.Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)The look of the movie was just great  the characters, the long drawn action sequences (extremely difficult in stop-motion) and the surroundings were just awesome. The tiny village, the sea and the home that was once Kubo's are just perfect setting to a visual treat that Kubo and the two strings is. Some of my best sequences were with the enchanted origami paper  they were just brilliant. It reminded of Ninjai, the little Ninja  a web based animation that also tells the story of a young samurai.The editing could have been a wee-bit sharper as sometimes I didn't understand a couple of things.Direction and Overall (D &O)I think Travis Knight and Laika did a stupendous job with this movie. After reading about how difficult it is doing stop-motion, I am more respectful for this format and appreciate the beauty of some of the sequences more. The film is a little long and does slow down in a couple of spots so that is something that not everyone will enjoy.So here are my scores according to my new system:Plot and Script (P&S)- 1.5Characterization and Acting (C&A)  1.5Sounds and Effects (S&E)  2.0Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)  1.5Direction and Overall (D &O)  1.5Overall Score  8.5 out of 10Kubo is not everyone's cup of tea but I urge you to watch it once for the innocence, the power of a visual story and the deep spiritual connection and conviction that the characters have  great for all ages.First reviewed on broth of blogsYou might also likeJungle Book"
186,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,19 October 2016,"Magical, beautiful and emotional...","What can I say!? I really love Laika films - their stop-motion animation style is wonderful and they make movies that truly appeal to all ages. This film certainly didn't disappoint! Kubo was magical, beautiful, and emotional. The stop-motion animation was incredible, perhaps the best I've ever seen (and apparently this is the longest stop-motion picture ever made!) Though the plot feels very familiar, the world was so well realised and there are plenty of minor surprises along the way. The sentimental moments are handled with perfection - I genuinely had tears rolling down my cheeks at the end! Highly recommended!"
187,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,13 October 2016,"Funnily Enough, There Are Three.","From Laika, the company who brought us Coraline, Paranorman and Boxtrolls, we've been given another stop-motion treat. Actually, ""treat"" is a massive understatement for this masterpiece of a movie.Yes, Kubo and the Two Strings is incredible.The first thing that jumps out with Kubo is its awe-inspiring stop- motion animation, and incredible settings brought to life with fantastic CGI  there is a perfect mix of stop-motion and CGI to make everything look gert good to full effect. There is a huge grandeur to the film, as Kubo embarks on his amazing adventure in his highly detailed and breathtaking world. The character designs are also particularly charming, and unique, with a huge influence of ancient Japanese culture  colourful designs like those of the samurai.It is the inspiration of Japanese culture that makes the film's aesthetic so special, as the beautiful landscapes of Japan are reflected in the massive world the studio managed to so finely create. From Kubo's quaint Japanese village to the snowy and huge mountains and caves, this film has it all in terms of setting.The soundtrack is also an integral part of making Kubo and the Two Strings the special experience it is. This aspect of the film is also hugely influenced by ancient Japanese culture, with the constantly alternating and oriental sounding strings pervading through the run time  orchestras are also used to great dramatic effect.Perhaps more important, however, is the action. Kubo and the Two Strings is an action adventure film, and throughout our protagonist's immense journey, intense battle scenes are an important and enjoyable factor. Dramatic action sequences provide a stream of excitement in the movie, showing off the animation in great set-pieces.Of course, characters are always vital to moving a film from good to great. This particular film gets character absolutely spot on. There is a potent mix of comedy, bonding and emotional drive in Kubo and the Two Strings' cast; as the three protagonists of Kubo, 'Monkey' and 'Beetle' show. You'd be right in thinking Kubo's the main guy, and rightfully so, because through him the adventure and the emotion of his story are driven. 'Monkey' brings a nice li'l mixture of comedy and emotion, as well as giving the movie a much needed aggressive edge. 'Beetle', my personal favourite, is the perfect comedy relief, as through him there is a stream of light and well written funnies. The best thing about the three main characters, however, is the unbreakable bond created between them (they've got great voice actors at the helm, to boot), something that is built right as Kubo sets off on his quest.This particular quest Kubo embarks on is one of finding the magical armour of his late samurai father, and getting sweet, sweet revenge against the villains of the piece, who stole his eye, and intend to grab his other for good measure. It's a simple story, but oh so effective. As I wrote about in dat Finding Dory review (a bit), the simpler, the more memorable and followable (there's that Shakespeare thing coming out of me again  oops) the story, and the film as a whole, becomes  and unless it's one of those psychological science fictions like Ex Machina (ha, two links in one paragraph), it could easily mean it is better than something that goes too crazy with its plot. The basic plot in Kubo and the Two Strings acts as a foundation for further story-telling. The basic plot develops through the film to something deeper, and something that is potently delivered with impressive amounts of emotion (look, I was close to crying, okay?). It all comes to an immense close with its dramatic finale, too.Some might think it all gets a little over-the-top as the film comes to a close, but that isn't the case. Everything comes together, in quite awesome fashion. Another qualm people have about the movie is that Beetle seems like a bit of a tacked on comedy relief for the kids, and although his lines aren't constantly funny, I found there were a lot of really clever lines and for the most part he is indeed funny.To conclude, Kubo and the Two Strings is by far the best film of 2016 so far, and probably one of the best of this decade, with its awe-inspiring animation, potently delivered story, brilliant character and fantastic world creation all shown off in Kubo's incredible and action-packed journey  nice helpings of comedy and emotion are very welcome too."
188,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,10 October 2016,Kubo  and  the  Two  Strings,"Kubo and the Two Strings and Zootopia are the two animated films I have liked the most this year, and curiously, they had nothing to do with Pixar. I guess it was unavoidable because, on the one hand, I don't watch as many animated films as I used to anymore; and on the other hand, Pixar stopped being a guarantee of exceptional quality many years ago. Kubo and the Two Strings was made by the studio Laika, and the first thing which draws the attention is its unusual technique, combining the beautiful hand-made aesthetic of the mock-ups and stop motion with the flexibility and realism of digital animation. We had already seen something similar in the previous movies from this studio (such as Coraline and ParaNorman), but rarely with the scale and ambition of Kubo and the Two Strings. And that fusion of techniques doesn't only offer amazing images, but it also contributes to the narrative. However, the screenplay feels a bit ordinary, at least from the structural point of view; we simply have another ""special"" boy with an impossible mission which requires defeating his insecurities, solving his feelings to a missing fatherly figure and learning to collaborate with allies (and maybe enemies) who metaphorically or literally represent the challenges of maturity and the responsibilities of adult life. Fortunately, what elevates the screenplay of Kubo and the Two Strings are the details, from the ambiguous historical period to the easiness with which fantastic elements are introduced without requiring any complicated explanations or bothersome preambles. The voice actors make a perfect work, both the famous ones (Matthew McConaughey, Charlize Theron) and the relatively unknown ones (highlighting Art Parkinson as Kubo, expressing the exact point between childish innocence and adult responsibility). And we also have some memorable voices elevating certain supporting roles, including Ralph Fiennes, Rooney Mara, Brenda Vaccaro and George Takei. In conclusion, I wouldn't say it's an excellent film, but I enjoyed Kubo and the Two Strings pretty much, and I recommend it with confidence as a solid experience for the whole family, and an eloquent proof that stop motion can easily compete with any digitally animated movie."
189,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,9 October 2016,Unusual movie but EPIC!!!!!,"Really liked the animation and setting. It was about a boy called Kubo who needed to find golden armour to protect himself from his grandfather and aunties. He is good at origami and makes a boat out of leaves! Great storyline, slightly confusing at times - but comes together at the end very well.Not like other films I've seen and I really enjoyed it.Some great battles and magic. The sword was in a massive skeleton's head that could move by magic. The chest plate was under the sea, protected by a massive sea-monster with huge eyes. The helmet was in the village he once lived in. It has a happy ending."
190,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,5 October 2016,Great film with amazing story and animation,"Kubo and the Two Strings has an interesting story, made better by the amazing animations, and is something that people of all ages can enjoy. Kubo is telling a truly unique tale set in ancient Japan that is rich with the depth of story. It told of a boy who released a vengeful spirit and went on an adventure to unlock secrets of his past. Although not usually finding these types of movies interesting, I liked Kubo and the Two Strings. Movies like this, which I would call children's movie, usually do not have a very good story and you can guess what will happen. Kubo and the Two Strings was different in the fact that it was not as predictable, and this made it more suspenseful. The plot was interesting, mixing just a bit of history and mythology, but in a fun manner. It includes magic, music, and monsters that come together to create a marvelous fairy tale that is scary, sweet, and full of tough emotions. These are things that many children avoid, but Kubo and the Two Strings did a good job putting everything together. It had everything that makes a good children's movie and included dread, death and demons, making it a little different. It was good that it was not all fun and games, and that made it more enjoyable for older audiences. Overall, it was a good film with a beautifully told story matched with amazing animations."
191,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,24 September 2016,"Kubo, you have master animators, why do you have to cover it all up with CGI...","Kubo and the Two Strings opens to a raging ocean and some establishing shots of a woman performing some magic. After a beautiful scene, we cut to some years later. The woman, who is nigh comatose, is being taken care of by her twelve or thirteen years old son, Kubo. We watch as Kubo wakes up and makes breakfast before walking from their cave dwelling to the nearby town. Kubo provides for the family by telling stories. In one of the best scenes in the movie, he pulls out origami paper and his samisen (the same one that his mother held), and begins telling a thrilling story that captures the imagination of the town. When he plays and speak, the paper floats into the air and folds itself becoming a spider, a chicken, and a brave samurai. In the interest of the review, Yada yada yada, Kubo and his magical friends (a Monkey, and a Beetle) have to go on a magical journey to get three magical items to stop the villainous Moon King.Kubo and the Two Strings was made by the same people as Coraline (wonderful!) and The Boxtrolls (terribly disappointing!). Kubo falls into the same trap as The Boxtrolls; they put too much CGI on top of the beautiful miniatures. What's the point of the stop motion if I can't tell what it is? In fact, a coworker of mine thought it was a CGI movie. The thing about Claymation and stop motion animation is that there is something unique about the texture. It's a good thing to see that they are models. You never lose sight of the fact that what you are watching is a construct so it's like you are being told a story (rather than have the fantasy that you are being transported to another world). There is a behind the scenes sequence during the credits; it shows the animators working on a large model. The film speeds up and the monster comes to life and interacts with the artists. It really gives an indication of the scale of the movie that would've otherwise been lost. There are other super cool behind the scenes clips on YouTube. One explains that these Eyeball creatures were made out of lights and thin metal (to create a really cool effect) and the motion was mapped to the rolling of a bowling ball. But, I ask, what's the point? It feels kinda weird to ask but, what's the point of going through all this work when the CGI flattens all of the absurdly detailed models. Another side effect of having so much CGI, is that there are jarring moments when the puppetry becomes the focal point of a scene. In the case of Kubo, all of the animation is super smooth until you get to this old woman. Her really exaggerated facial expressions are jarring because one second she has squinting eyes and the next instant her mouth and eyes are totally open. The transition between the two looked like something of a blur. It didn't feel like it fit with the rest of the movie. And, speaking of the feel of the movie, I wasn't getting a good sense of space.Let's compare Kubo to Coraline. If you've never seen Coraline, it's set in and around a pink mansion. In each of the scenes and in each of the rooms, you really get a sense of the world. The rooms are distinct enough that they stand on their own but they form a cohesive world and experience. In Kubo, we start off pretty good. We see his cave-home and how it connects to the village. Before too long, we cut to a snowstorm in ""the badlands."" All we can see is white snow blowing about. We don't know where we are in relation to the village nor do we even get the sense that it's cold. Then we're transported to a cavern, and then a forest, and then the ""endless lake""? Sure they show transitions between the settings to connect them (aside from the initial cut to the badlands) but the sense of cohesion is missing.The last point I'd like to make about Kubo is that I was disappointed by the general lack of music, or at least the role of music wasn't what I was looking forward to. I mean, it's called Kubo and the Two Strings, like two strings of a samisen (the music instrument that he plays). From the looks of the trailer, I thought he was going to be doing all sorts of magic with it. His instrument would be his magic wand, if you will. But, that wasn't quite the case. He plays his samisen but it isn't required to do magic. Some of my favorite parts of the movie focused on him playing but they were few and far between.Overall, if you want to watch a really good stop-motion movie watch Coraline. If you've seen Coraline before, go watch it again. There were sequences in Kubo that that I really enjoyed but they didn't stave off the disappointment I felt from the overuse of CGI, the lack of a sense of space, and the lack of music. If you are a big fan of stop motion animation, maybe I'd say give it a go (at a matinée at most) if for no other reason than see how it compares to Coraline and Nightmare Before Christmas. But then again, if you're that big a fan of stop motion animation, you've probably already seen Kubo."
192,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,19 September 2016,Is it worth the price of a movie ticket? YES!,"Kubo: If you must blink, do it now.Every time Laika comes out with a film, I am pleasantly surprised! Laika has made various animated films such as Coraline, ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls and now Kubo and The Two Strings. Each one is completely awesome in it's own story and if you have not seen any of them, I suggest you watch them right away! Kubo and the Two Strings is a polished masterpiece and surpasses the 3 films Laika created before it (although The Boxtrolls is also very very good!). This film has a little bit (and a lot) of everything! It is adventurous, action packed, dramatic, funny, sad, suspenseful and even a little scary! The script that was written combined with the no limitations of animation is a perfect duo! You really dig into this film and become attached from the very first scene all the way to the last, forgetting that you are watching a film and feeling like you are apart of the story unfolding. This is my definition of great film making and this film will sit in my Top 10 list of favorites for a very long time.The world that Kubo lives in is rich with color, culture, history, mythos and story. The characters are uniquely created with dynamic personality, not one character in this film seems out of place or distracts from the story. The voice acting for the characters added so much life to the film as well. Charlize Theron played the voice of the monkey and did a fantastic job of being serious but loving, Matthew McConaughey also did a fine job playing the part of a forgetful but highly skilled man-beetle who may have not been the smartest of the bunch but was very brave and loyal.The sound track was top notch with music by Dario Marianelli, a fine composer who also worked on The Boxtrolls, The Soloist, Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, and many many other well known titles. I am planning on buying the soundtrack for it's originality, rich cultural notes, and it's timelessness. It is sure to be a classic, one of those soundtracks you listen to and can't help but drift off to the time you watched the film and for that 101 minutes, you were in a completely different world with such a feeling of awe that only a film you love can bring you. Kudos to Regina Spektor for singing beautifully a song we all know and love called ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" by The Beatles. It is the only song in the film with words and if I am not mistaken, it is played only in the ending credits. I believe it was perfectly selected and remade to match the story of Kubo and the Two Strings.The cinematography in this film also exceeded my expectations. There were scenes that were dark and scary to scenes that were bright and beautiful. Use of camera moves and angles as well as transitions such as when Kubo was walking through the forest, showed creativity and added to the film. The camera moves were never distracting and almost hidden within each cut which is extremely important for this film because the director would bring you from feeling very happy and upbeat to very sad and then to feeling scared and suspenseful all in one scene! If you are ever wondering what you should see in theaters next, I recommend this film without a doubt. It is for everybody and is such a jewel with such an incredible story! I went in without any expectations or not knowing what it was about and I came out with a new favorite film of all time (at least #3 or #4, still undecided)."
193,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,18 September 2016,A Wonderfully Made Film--That Falls Just Short of Great,"I went to see ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" a couple of weeks ago somewhat on a whim--it was one of those nights when I was wanting to go to the movies as much to get out of the house and eat popcorn as to actually see any specific film. I saw where this animated feature was getting rave reviews, so I decided I'd give it a shot.I definitely didn't feel like this movie was a waste of either time or money. The movie is extremely well made, from the animation to the script to the voice actors. Kubo is a young man who sets out on a journey to overcome forces of darkness, and along the way he is transported to another realm where he encounters friend and foe in the hunt for three sacred relics which will aid him in his fight.All that said, from one angle there's really not much to dislike about this movie. It's reasonably fun and accessible. And, again, the animation is extraordinary.And yet, there was just something about this movie that is hard to articulate, but nevertheless made it less enjoyable than I might have hoped. I think it all boils down to likability. The movie was top notch in how it was made--but there are more likable stories out there. The hunt for the three relics comes across a bit like a video game. I couldn't help but think of ""The Legend of Zelda"" as I watched the hunt for the sword, armor, and helmet--all of which upgrade Kubo's status, so to speak. And the gist of the film itself falls into the ""epic"" genre, and yet the script follows the standard formula for an epic story so closely that it feels somewhat trite.On a different note, this movie committed what I consider a cardinal sin for this genre of film aimed at young viewers: It had a brief comment that was basically an allusion to profanity. Specifically, a character at one time says ""Oh, foot!"" just as he was about to be stepped on by some giant threat in that particular scene. This was clearly a suggestive phrase meant to conjure up another ""F"" word. Why put that in a kids movie? What's the point? For those reasons I'm giving this otherwise perfect film eight out of ten stars. It's delightful--but predictable. Epic, but in a way that feels a bit boring. It's still watchable and you may find it more to your liking than I did to mine. But don't be surprised if your kids start saying ""Oh, foot!"" whenever something is about to happen. And who wants that?"
194,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,14 September 2016,"Animation, Not Just for Talking Animals","Trailers that ran prior to my screening of Kubo: Sing, talking animals participate in a citywide talent show. The Wild Life, talking animals and Robinson Crusoe defend their island from marauding pirates. Storks, talking storks deliver packages for an online retail company. This is the state of American animation. Now any or all of these movies could be good, none will push the frontiers of what a film can be. Production company LAIKA understands animation's infinite capacity. The wonder found in Kubo and the Two Strings is a direct result of the filmmaker's devotion to every single frame, sublime sustenance to our collectively starved imaginations. KATTS is a fairytale pepped with an infusion of Japanese culture. The film opens with infant Kubo and his mother adrift on a raging sea. They are fleeing Kubo's grandfather, the Moon King, who has slain his father. They find land, but Kubo's mother is permanently addled from the journey. Years later, Kubo cares for his mother by entertaining the villagers, manipulating paper with a magical shamisen. One day, Kubo fails to take shelter before nightfall and is discovered. His lucid mother saves him from her moonfolk sisters, but is vanquished. Kubo is forced to go on a journey to discover the three pieces of the mirror armor, the one weapon that can defeat his grandfather. He is joined by a monkey created by his mother's magic and a cursed samurai turned beetle. I guess you can never escape talking animals.The plot is driven by the McGuffin mirror armor. To win the Sword Unbreakable, Kubo must battle a skeleton colossus with swords lodge in its head. This monstrosity is similar to a mythical Japanese Gashadokuro. It has ferocious face and a suitable ascetic for Claymation. Unfortunately, subsequent conflicts are primary fought against Kubo's aunts. Erie spirts, sure, but these struggles boil down to weapons clanging against weapons. The sickle/counter-weight combination and masks are inspired by Japanese mythology, but if you're going to commit to looting a culture, try harder. This a part of a disappointing pattern: Kubo and the Two Strings is less than the sum of its frames. The fairytale morals also need a bit of work. Family is good. Love is good. Stories are powerful. Family is always with you. KATTS was not intended to be a morality tale, but this is lame. The Moon King is Kubo's grandfather, some ambiguity seemed inevitable. I guess the antagonist's fate is not cookie cutter, but his motivations are basically pure evil. Our main characters provide some measure of redemption. Gruff Monkey (Theron) is not a typical matron. Her toughness allows her to both play the straight man and hint at a softer interior. Her secret origin might suggest a different personality, but this alternative adds dimensionality. Beetle (McConaughey) is more impressive. His curse denies him all memory and his demeanor is perfectly in line. Beetle's face is animated unlike any other object in the film. I do not know the technique, but it is genuinely unforgettable in close up. Kubo is more of a puzzle. The movie is essentially his coming of age story. He confronts many challenges and his identity, but there is virtually no inner struggle. In most movies this is a problem, but honestly, I was not overtly aware of this deficiency. I think it is because we see enough aspects of Kubo that obvious change is not essential. Kubo is a boy, but also a caretaker, storyteller, and prodigy. His confidence and maturity vary, understandable for a boy in his position. LAIKA also borrowed a classic Ghibli tricks of developing a character by emphasizing their mannerism in performing everyday actions. This is a superior way to build character and can make movements as simple as picking up a piece of paper a joyous event.So Kubo and the Two Strings occasionally stumbles, but this is after the fact analysis. These nitpicks should only bother the unreasonably sensitive. Kubo's beautiful world, his actions, others' reactions, these are the only aspects I was always attune to. The first act is worthy on any Great Movie. Watching the townspeople listen to Kubo's stories allows us to simply become part of the crowd. The plot might be simple, but this meta-story and the early use of narration suggest a master craftsman. The mythology leaves us wanting more, borrowing from a culture without appealing to exoticness. The Claymation often bizarre or seemingly off tempo, demands attention. Kubo and the Two Strings transcends typical animation. It is not a product, one side designed for children with a flip side for the parents who bought the tickets. Kubo and the Two Strings is an eccentric adventure, capable of inspiring wonder in all audiences."
195,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,13 September 2016,"Thematically rich, genuine and in equal measure, magical","The power of having a good opening scene cannot be underestimated; likewise the importance of a great opening line. My favourite ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"" has never been surpassed (if you know where this is taken from, R-E-S-P-E-C-T for you!); that is until Kubo and the Two Strings came along. What an opening line! And throughout the story it is uttered a few more times and each time it does it more than earns the right for it to be uttered. The line is seared into my brain. The stop-motion animation is gorgeous and it serves the dream-like story so well. Thematically rich, genuine and in equal measure, magical. We unpacked the multi-layered story during the long drive back and we are still unsprawling the wondrous themes today. There are so many. Don't worry, I will keep my mouth shut and not do you the disservice of laying them out for you. Like the great animated films Pixar used to make in abundance, Kubo and the Two Strings will work for all age groups. However, I do feel the little kids will be bored; unless the kid understands death and possesses reverence for wisdom. Steeped in Japanese history, traditional practices and mythology, the level of storytelling here is right up there in the highest of reaches. It is definitely ambitious, dense and complex. It may not have scored in every instance but in this time and age where almost every movie feels like a regurgitation of an old idea, I am going to give a standing ovation to this. This is the most original film I have seen this year. I think they might as well hand over the Best Animated Feature Academy Award to Laika already."
196,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,13 September 2016,Laika's Best Film Yet,"Kubo and the Two Strings is the fourth feature film from Studio Laika, the animation studio responsible for some of the best stop motion films of the past couple of years. Their previous work includes Coraline, The Boxtrolls and ParaNorman, all of which have been consistently fantastic, mixing studio Laika's signature stop motion animation with heartfelt stories and memorable characters. And Kubo might just be their best film yet. It's the brilliant kind of family film that doesn't just try to distract kids for an hour and a half, but instead challenges them, whilst also taking us on an epic adventure not quite like any I've seen done through stop motion animation before. The films story feels as if it's been ripped right from the pages of a classic fairy-tale. Kubo (Art Parkinson) is a young boy gifted with magical powers that allow him to control paper using his shamisen. At day he uses his powers to tell stories in a nearby town, often telling tales of his father, who was a legendary samurai warrior. Then at night he must return to live with his mother in a cave, as if he wonders out at night Kubo's grandfather, the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes), will find him and steal his remaining eye to make him blind to the world. One night Kubo ventures out too long and his grandfather sends his mothers sisters (both played by Rooney Mara) to capture him. Now with the help of a strict and protective monkey (Charlize Theron) that has been bought to life from a wood carving to protect Kubo and Beetle (Matthew McConaghey) who is a samurai that was transformed in to a giant insect man, Kubo sets off on a quest to find his fathers armour and defeat the Moon King. They never really explore much what exactly the Moon King's powers are or why they need to find the armour to defeat him. But just like we never need to know where the fairy godmother comes from in Cinderella, we never need a backstory here. We're so caught up enjoying the adventure and are too invested in Kubo's journey to start questioning the logic of this world. Also whilst all the characters of the film play their typical roles, they all play them so well. Our trio of heroes are all hilarious and lovable whilst the villains are genuinely threatening, having an intimidating presence whenever they're on screen in a similar style to the Other Mother from Coraline. The story is the stuff of mythical legend, but Kubo's journey in the film is one that we can all relate to. He ends up facing a great deal of loss in the film, which is something that any viewer can relate to in some way. But the film tackles death in a very unique way. Instead of just showing death to be the end, this film serves to remind us that the ones we love will always be with us within the memories that we cherish. That they can live on through us and the stories that we tell. It's a message that might sound difficult and complex for a kids film, but it's told in such an elegant way that it's actually a very accessible message for audiences of all ages. Then there's the films breath taking imagery. It's always incredible to see what minds like Pixar are able to do with computer generated animation, but there's something truly special about seeing a film on this scale made using stop motion animation. It's the same reason to love a film like Fury Road over something else that favours CGI. It just looks all the more impressive when it's really there. Plus the epic scale that Laika's undertaken for this production is remarkable. Whilst there is some CGI used, the focus on all the action sequences remains on using real sets and stop motion characters to tell the story. For example, in one stunning sequence Kubo is fighting a giant skeleton to retrieve a sword, which the animators created by using a giant 18 foot puppet in order to capture the scale of the monster. Kubo is a rare family film that succeeds at just about everything that it sets out to do. It's both fun and adventurous, whilst also containing a very melancholy tone that's never afraid to take the film in to some dark places. Beyond this, the films ending, particularly its final shot, is something truly beautiful that really must be experienced to be completely understood."
197,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,12 September 2016,Kubo has strung his way as the best film of the year so far.,"The latest film from Laika studios (the team behind Coraline and Paranorman), Kubo and the Two Strings is about a young boy on a quest to find three pieces of armour in order to finish his father's mission and defeat the Moon King. Having never seen a Laika animated film before, I was slightly nervous going into this. I love the traditional Japanese mythology and folklore, so this was definitely going to intrigue me...but I did not expect this outcome. This, is simply a masterpiece. I'm not exaggerating, this film is flawless. I tried to find a fault, I really did but alas I could not. Let me start off by saying the voice acting in this movie is incredible, with such talents including: Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Rooney Mara, Ralph Fiennes and even newcomer Art Parkinson. It feels so natural, Theron being a monkey and McConaughey voicing a human beetle...and it felt so right! The excellent voice acting makes these lovable characters even more likable. Monkey being the mean serious companion while Beetle is the funny dumb one, it makes for an excellent contrast. The story is actually rather melancholic and the scriptwriter knows that children are actually smart, so it makes sense to treat them like adults and include themes like death and remorse. This could then lead to the debate of the film being rated a '12' as opposed to a 'PG' (here in the UK of course), but in an age where kids have access to the Internet, I think they can handle these sensitive themes. In contrast, this means the film is then enjoyable for adults so it's a clever move from the studio. Each character in the story has their own rich backstory and the film is so well done that it builds it's own mythology in the space of 102 minutes, by the end of the film you know all about the quest to defeat the Moon King. The animation in the film is sublime, beautiful, absolutely majestic...I've never seen such flawless animation before. The long shots into the horizon, the close up action, even the credits. Speaking of action, there is quite bit of action to keep viewers entertained from the heavy story and it is will balanced. This is one of the great things about Kubo, is that as a viewer you will feel every emotion. The script will make you laugh on several occasions, you will get teary at certain scenes, you'll be on the edge of you seat. It's just so well balanced that it makes for the perfect movie, I mean this is why we go to the cinema, to be taken away and transported into a world and actually become attached to the characters. Overall, Kubo and the Two Strings is flawless, a modern day masterpiece with plenty of laughs, tears and excitement. Do yourself a favour, watch it now as it truly deserves to be watched.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com"
198,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,12 September 2016,Superb film with a lovely story and stunning visuals,"I cannot recommend Kubo and the Two Strings highly enough. If you're evening thinking about it, then just go. My girlfriend and I went to see it and it was wonderful. It's fascinating to see the progress of stop motion over time, and Laika is really pushing the envelope with this movie. The use of 3D printed elements brings a very clean finish to the puppets in Kubo. Kubo is a breathtakingly beautiful movie. The characters in Kubo are a sight to behold. From the creepy sisters, to the hilarious beetle every character draws you further into the story. Kubo manages to be surprisingly funny, with excellent voice acting. In summary, great story, great visuals, great movie. A+. Keep making movies like this Laika!"
199,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,11 September 2016,I can't praise this enough; seriously wow right here!,"Having had a bunch of screenings at the local cinema I work, including one when one customer took her daughter out of the screen when she was scared at the first 3 minutes, that never sold heavily I was interested in what this slick looking animated movie with an amazing cast was actually like besides ""good"" as so many people say...My opinion: IT IS AMAZING! The visuals are holy hell amazing, not the least because of the stop motion adding such a interesting tint and feel to the animation that rivals the creativity and cool Cinematography of the Wallace and Gromit films of which I enjoy, and Coraline by the same studio which is also badass in its animation. The script should be considered seriously for Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars, as it blends story twists I didn't see coming with witty fun dialogue delivered with infectious confidence by a great cast, and a HUGE scope - this is certainly an animated epic unlike most of those seen before - this is great storytelling. It also great to note that this is a kids film that intergrates the importance and power of storytelling as a motif without patronising, how it has a threat without being overly terrifying, and how it entertains. That is really the best part of the film; it doesn't talk themes the way Zootropolis did (by the way, Zootropolis is amazing, see that as well) but it keeps investment. The cast is amazing with what they do, with Game of Thrones Art Parkinson being a very credible voice talent, Ralph Fiennes excelling at being a terrifying monster as the Antagonist Moon King but then turn that around expertly with a heart warming resolution to that character, Charlize Theron being a cynical but strong voice as Kubo's mother and later the monkey, and the sadistic and sinister Aunts, both voiced by Rooney Mara that shows off a future in animation, as well as live action features as she makes use of this recurring but small role. The best however, and most surprising, was the Beetle as voiced by Matthew McConaughey: this Beetle is simple, but likable, and dependable in moments of need, and McConaughey makes this a character that never gets annoying, and when they reveal his true nature, I was happy as hell.The music was also amazing, the sound design even exceeding that. Why you still reading this? This is literally a flawless movie - go and see it the first chance you have!"
200,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,11 September 2016,an instant classic(possible spoilers),"Kubo and the two strings is the latest Laika Studios film directed by Travis Knight. The film is nothing short of an astonishing achievement, especially in the animation department. It's a very artistic, beautifully animated revolutionary movie for all ages, most likely for adults. And not because it is gory, scary or anything like that, but because of the subtle and smart, intriguing ideas and messages that the film conveys. Kids can enjoy it for the cute talking animals and the perfectly executed action sequences, while adults can enjoy its melancholic, sad and emotionally character driven story with its subtle message and ideas. The best thing about this movie is the way it presents the message. It can be stretched and seen as the way you like it to be. It can be about family ties, it can be about love, about honor and heroism, about cultural heritages and keeping the stories of our old ancestors going on, or about how much important imagination is for children, which is a very strong and powerful message for the kids. The movie is very artistic in its music too. It's not just musical background, the music is played according to what's going on. It plays a very huge part especially for an emotional direction and the stories Kubo and the characters tell about their loved ones. Kubo and the two strings is nothing short than an instant classic and a beautiful work of art for all ages to appreciate and admire. 9/10"
201,Kubo and the Two Strings,,10 September 2016,Kobo Sensitive Yet Strong,"A boy named Kobo lives with his ill mother. And how that she was or is trying to protect him from something evil. Like warning him not to stay out late at night due to having his left eye taken.And has a gift with his two string Shamisen like a guitar, into an Origami a story that is makes paper going into live action. He makes great stories. But the problem is he can't finish them.But when he stays out late at night over a ceremony where loved ones who try to communicate with the dead that is called an Obon.

Together they form an unlikely partnership to protect the boy. With the evil sisters and someone else trying to get his eye. It shows sensitive and strong characters. And great writing and acting."
202,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,10 September 2016,"A technical marvel, narrative flaws are overshadowed by some of the best animation of all time","Laika is growing to be one of my favourite studios currently making films, which makes it disappointing that they aren't drawing in the box office numbers needed to be a commercially successful studio. Maybe it's because Laika makes more mature family films than families are willing to watch, maybe it's because Stop motion is old fashioned to the general public, maybe it was just mismarketed.But Kubo deserves the acclaim it's getting, if just for the animation alone. The art design, sets and puppets they used, flawlessly animated, makes for some of the richest and most beautiful animation ever put to film. The film now also boasts one of the largest stop-motion puppets ever constructed, as well as some stunning fight choreography far beyond the expectations for the medium.The story, however, isn't as good as the animation. Don't get me wrong, it has its moments, and the relationship between Kubo and his mother is definitely moving, but with a predictable twist and some unnecessary comic relief in the form of Beetle, and a not-so-good ending, the story falters in ways that the animation doesn't. I will commend it, however, for exploring the theme of death and loss in a way most family films fail to do.In conclusion, if you're at all interested in watching a spectacularly animated work of art, then Kubo is not a bad choice."
203,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,10 September 2016,The Soul Remembers,"""Kubo and the Two Strings"" soars and dares for greatness. Director and Animator Travis Knight's ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is a visual masterpiece that celebrates the power of storytelling to inspire and forgive. Charlize Theron's voice echoes that memories are ""the greatest magic of all"". The mind may forget, but the soul remembers in ""Kubo"". It is one of the best movies of the year. Knight's ""Kubo"" has the feel of an old Japanese fable about samurai, family, and love. In a breathtaking scene, tiny Shinto lantern boats which honor the deceased float out into the night sea. Marc Haimes and Chris Butler wrote the wonderful screenplay; Haimes and Shannon Tindle wrote the timeless story. ""Kubo"" is a stop action animated movie a precise and time intensive process. Knight's mesmerizing imagery and Haimes and Butler's eloquent words generate the innocence and wonder of Kubo's journey. Knight displays many diverse images like the ship composed of autumn leaves on an ocean of origami blue. Contrast that with the eerie night sky as the evil Witch Sisters (scary Rooney Mara) battle against Kubo's Mother. ""Kubo"" is more than good against evil. It is about love and forgiveness void of enemies. The brave boy samurai Kubo, radiantly voiced by young Art Parkinson, deserves to find peace and his place in the world. Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey are amazing as the voices of Kubo's protectors, who would die for him. Samurai means ""to serve"". They transcend their promise to love forever. As the story opens Kubo and his Mother wash up upon the barren beach. Infant Kubo is missing an eye. Later we see Kubo with eye patch caring for his ailing Mother, weakened and memory fading, in a cave above the Japanese seaside village. Apparently, his Mother was a very formidable witch. Kubo plays his magical shamisen (lute) for the villagers below. The shamisen tunes create origami characters that tell his Mother's stories of his father, samurai Hanzo. Kubo is resilient and joyful. A magical spell of nightfall guards Kubo from the malevolent Moon King (ominous Ralph Fiennes at his ""Harry Potter"" best).One evening, failing to comply with the spell Kubo shockingly discovers his fate. Tragedy ensues. The noble warrior Monkey (powerful Theron) emerges as Kubo's guardian. They must find the magical sword, armor, and helmet of his father to defeat the Moon King. Along the journey, Beetle (breezy strong McConaughey) also enrolls as Kubo's protector. Beetle was a samurai beholding to Hanzo, before he transformed into a large armored beetle. Other than that he remembers nothing. Knight touchingly fosters the bonds among the three-- an elemental triad. Theron and McConaughey presence sublime familiarity and affinity. Poignantly, Monkey tells the story of Hanzo, who says, ""You are my quest."" Heroes inspire new heroes into existence. Kubo's journey is that of a hero. The battles are fierce and costly including a gigantic skeleton, and the climatic conflict of destiny. ""Kubo and the 2 Strings"" is awesome. What I was left with were the final images of ""Kubo"". They move with the elegance and power of Japanese calligraphy strokes. It is beauty to the soul. Nothing more needs to be said."
204,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,10 September 2016,Pure Artwork,"From the magicians that created Coralline and The Boxtrolls, Laika and debut director Travis Knight present us with a strong magical, beautiful, and captivating story of Kubo (Art Parkinson); a young boy with the power to tell stories with origami. We however find Kubo on a life changing journey to locate three hidden relics, with the help of Monkey (Charlize Theron), and Beatle (Mathew McConaughey), as they also fend off the frightening evil Sisters.What can be said about this film other than as a true piece of artwork. Kubo is a majestic privilege for the eyes as you invest yourself into the amazing world of ancient Japan. But the film doesn't just work because of its wondrous appearance but also because of its remarkable story to tell.Immediately you dive into a mysterious dark opening with the protagonist speaking over like a natural born storyteller. From there we meet a very intriguing Kubo who makes a living by using his powers with his Shamisen to manipulate paper into amazing figures to tell gripping stories, and as a carer for his loving but sick mother. But when evil finds the mother and son, Kubo enters a quest to find a lost armor to face against the Moon King.Layered with also a tranquil and moving score by Dario Marianelli, Kubo transports you into an astounding tale of family, magic, and life. What especially leaves you so enticed is the end of the film which ends with the brilliant While My Guitar Gently Weeps performed by Regina Spektor. What makes the entire film is that you realise how caught up in it you are as the film is proud and so aware of what it is, that you are forced to the admire the storytelling and craftsmanship of it.The film though is not quite a masterpiece due to a loss of atmosphere that sets the film off so well but slightly gets lost during a 30 minute period of non-stop jokes. The comedy does provide a fun tone to the film, but not so many jokes I believe were necessary.The film is light-hearted but it's not really the fun family film you may think it is. Although there is fun to be had there are quite a few scary scenes that might be quite intense for very young viewers. There are also themes, depth and emotion to the film that younger viewers will not quite grasp, but is touching to older audiences.Once again this is a great example of how creative and meaningful animated films can be, and is the reason why I'm an admirer of this kind of artistry. So a brilliant magical story with an effective voice cast especially Charlize Theron, but just true artwork and is a pure a 9.1/10."
205,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,10 September 2016,One of the Best Animated Movies I Have Ever Seen!,"""If you must blink, do it now"" That is the first line in Kubo and the Two Strings. I am struggling to think of a better first line for a movie, that not only made me immediately sit up a bit more in my chair, but also perfectly described the entire tone and theme of the rest of the movie. From there we see a woman in a boat in the middle of the ocean in the middle of a terrible storm, and with one magical stroke of her three stringed guitar parted an enormous wave and this was when I knew I was in for something special. Did I mention that all of this is displayed by some of the most exceptional stop-motion animation ever put to screen? Kubo and the Two Strings brings storytelling to life in a way that I don't think many movies have accomplished. The theme is clear from the beginning that this movie is about stories, and more specifically the way those stories are told. As I have alluded to earlier Kubo is incredibly written. Characters are fleshed out quickly and smoothly and you learn more with every piece of dialogue. The opening line sounds more like something out of a Tarantino movie rather than a PG rated animated movie. There are some jokes that don't land as well as I'm sure they had hoped but with the rest of the script as good as it is there is no reason to complain.The voice acting in this movie is off the charts good. Everyone, and I mean everyone is on the top of their game. Art Parkinson is Fantastic as Kubo, Charlize Theron can be a little flat in the more comedic lines but boy does she turn it on when necessary. I was most impressed with Matthew McConaughey though, for his first animated feature I expected his normal southern drawl. I was pleasantly treated to a real deep vocal performance. The rest of the cast is rounded out with stars, but you are already on IMDb so you can look them up but really an all around success from the voice acting.I am not traditionally a stop-motion fan. I have never seen any of the other Laika movies before but this movie has totally changed my opinion. Not only was the sheer size and depth of this movie daunting to think about, but there is something about the animation style that just draws you in. You forget about watching a movie and you really feel like you are watching someones moving art. I have always regarded Pixar and Disney as having the best animation style, but Kubo has changed my perception. There is something much more personal going on here and I will have trouble accepting anything else for some time.There is no better feeling than going to the movies and being completely taken over by a movie. That is what I got with Kubo and the Two Strings. As the movie went on I just liked it more and more and I kept waiting for it to drop off but no such thing happened. This is a strong movie top to bottom inside out. Kubo and the Two Swords is easily one of the best movies I have seen all year and completely succeeds in what it set out to be. I will patiently wait and hope for a sequel because my goodness this movie deserves one."
206,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,10 September 2016,"""If you must blink, do it now""","This is a Japanese fantasy movie from LAIKA, combination of stop motion animation and CGI, which already looks like a classic. The film starts with the opening line narrated 'If you must blink, do it now' and from there on you will find yourself totally immersed. Kubo is the tale of a humble child, earning a meagre living telling stories to the villagers, while playing his basic three stringed instrument. Kubo has a magical skill for origami, the paper folds itself when he plays. Kubo previously lost his left eye to the evil 'Moon King', and the Moon King wants the other remaining eye, it's important that Kubo does not go out after dark as this is when his other eye is most put at risk, so guess what  he goes out at night. After summoning some evil spirits, he must go on a quest to find his late father's mystical samurai amour and sword, or he will risk losing his remaining eye as well. On this journey he's befriended and aided by a courageous 'Monkey' and clumsy 'Beetle'. Ultimately he becomes a hero.This movie definitely has a good mix of action and humour for both children and adults, it has scary characters and scary intense action scenes including injury and death.Stay while the end credit are rolling, to enjoy a brilliant cover version of 'while my guitar gently weeps' - stay until after the end credits for a brief speeded up extract of the filming of the 16 foot robot character, you can easily appreciate the immense work involved in making this movie.It has become easy to identify the films released from Pixar or DreamWorks, but this movie has the look of a highly original and distinctive piece of work. If you are not moved by some of the themes then you certainly have no heart. This has got to be a strong contended (I already predict winner) for the best animated feature Oscar 2016. 10/10"
207,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,9 September 2016,"Laika Dethrones Pixar With ""Kubo and The Two Strings""","Impeccable and majestic beauty; Laika is already a strengthened production studio of distinguished films that combine traditional animation with a reserved use of digital technology, obtaining an air more craft and realistic, technique present in feature films such as the gloomy ""Coraline"" or the terrifying ""ParaNorman"", Laika has established a great fortitude and prestige in a world in where Pixar prevails year after year; ""Kubo and The Two Strings"" consolidates the essence of prior all films of the studio while adding something extra courtesy of a timeless visual and narrative magnificence, an eloquent feat of 2016 and openly a direct nominated to The Academy Awards.It has been a dilated and tortuous summer full of sequels and reboots that are going nowhere, but generate money at the box office; Alright! there were some surprises which astonished and excited to the general public, however, they did it on a template already employed, with characters, settings and even already existing soundtracks; nevertheless, thanks to Focus Features lands with Japanese moves the salvation of animated movies of this year, an original and nutritious film that will entertain to adults and instruct in children solid and beneficial teachings, even if I fear that will not receive what merits, this should not go unnoticed because it does not deserve it.Visibly, based and influenced by Eastern traditions, Kubo is a Japanese boy who lives with his disturbed mother on a crag close to a small village, the threads of the film are constitute in a magical and chimerical atmosphere, for this reason, Kubo attends to his village in order to bring to life realistic characters made of origami papers, which build an amazing story, story with a significant particularity, it never ends. Kubo knows that his father was an acclaimed warrior, who died by saving the eye right of his beloved son of the clutches of his grandfather and therefore, freeze the threat that revolved around his family, nonetheless, the danger is omnipresent as soon as the sun descends. Kubo, Monkey, and Beetle will move on a wild journey in looking for the different parts of the armor of his warrior father to eliminate the ghosts that invade his life of sorrow and bitterness and finally, give a real end to his grim own story.If Kubo would like to make use of the charms of the silent film - there is certain initial part in the movie that takes advantage of the muteness - to capture the attention of the spectators would be equally ostentatious, since, it only gives narrative strength - and what solidity! -, it also conceives meticulousness and scrupulousness in each frame, the arduous challenge of photograph and recreate settings, which are recognizable from our idea of reality, makes that the visual inventiveness and the proposal to appreciate the intricate effort provided by each member of the crew intensify. The melancholic individual scenes assimilated the same prestige than an intense action sequence. When you attend to the movie theater, you will be willing to realize of the most intricate details of its production, in case you discover any inaccuracy, however, from the first minutes dazzles us into its blinding landscapes and we forget our purpose radically, because if you must blink, do it now.Travis Knight, CEO of Laika, marks his directorial debut (Travis paid attention to every simplicity in the making of the films in order to develop his own movie with the strengths of each production) with a work brought to life with the greatest possible devotion, standing out among other adaptations of Hayao Miyazaki, because it is the only one that has reached to equalize his genuine imagination; This does not make human beings, magicians do it. The hair of monkey, the difficulty to create water ripple, the fascinating origami figures and the invention of the giant skeleton - the largest construction ever made in stop-motion - (all, all is absolutely of flesh and blood!) are reflection of the experience of Knight and he must prepare for the storm of proposals coming for him considering that a talent of this magnitude will not go unnoticed.Wabi-sabi is the author of the fluidity in textures of time and movement within the film, the art of seeing the beauty of the imperfect, and I don't mean that aesthetics is imperfect, on the contrary, it is fabulous, but Kubo does not become obsessed in capture detail to detail of Japanese culture, it strives to conceive a tremendously humane story coordinated with the physical reality of the characters and atmospheres ( better appreciated in 3D) captured by the meticulous stop-motion, serving of perfect vehicle for progress in the fleeting story.Sincerity, the overcome of death, the value of parents, the acceptance of the maturity and, above all, naive love prevail in every eloquent teaching that the movie wishes to instill. ""Kubo and The Two Strings"" is the animated film of summer, of the year and of the studio; with so many strengths and so few errors, the debut of Knight ensures its place in something more valuable than a golden statuette, ""Kubo"" ensures one place in the mind of each child and in the heart of each adult, simply excellent."
208,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,9 September 2016,Great animation!,"I just came from the theater and I have to say that Kubo delivered a fantastic journey which left me with a warm nice feeling. It might not be perfect with transitions from scene to another etc, but it's easy and light to follow and still in the background there's some deeper meaning for the story. Animation is fantastic.. or should I say perfect. Nothing more to say for that! Hard to say if it's made with a computer or stop motion. And the music, it was good - When the end credits rolled this last song just completed the whole package. This might not be for the youngest watchers or let's say for the fearful ones. My 5 years old boy loved everything and wasn't scared, but I know that he can watch scarier movies than many same aged children. Boy just said that this was the best animation he has seen to date. I give this 9/10 or ****½. Highly recommended!!! I was positively surprised.Don't read too much about the movie, just go and see it. You wont regret - even if you don't love it, you definitely not going to hate it."
209,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,9 September 2016,Made me feel like a 9 yr old,"This is an amazing film! So much so that it forced me to try to put my thoughts and praise for the film in words(first ever review). Kubo and the two strings is the best animated film I have seen in a long while, solely because it made me feel like a kid again. I almost felt that it accomplished what spirited away had done more than a decade ago. It has all the elements of an amazing story, it is scary,funny, ambitious and profound all knitted together in a story that captivates for the full duration of the film.(I held my pee for a good hour)It tackles themes like death, humanity and forgiveness through the most dynamic and colorful of characters. Any film that forces you to cheer for a monkey and beetle duo in a battle against evil is something to be appreciated. Highly recommend people of all ages to watch. Best bang for the buck since Mad Max(I know, I know , not the best comparison)"
210,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,9 September 2016,Strumming the heartstrings,"This is my review of Kubo and the Two Strings (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Since the studio's creepy debut 2009s Coraline Laika studios are now four for four without a dud in sight, and Kubo and the two Strings is not an exception. It's a run of quality from an animation studio to match the success of Pixar's early feature films. It went six without stumbling (Cars, obviously), so while Laika still has a long way to match that record it's still a hugely impressive record. Although the title is a bit lumbered as it could have the same title as an Indie folk band, Kubo and the Two Strings, is an original story presented as an ancient Japanese myth, with all the creatures and ghosts roaming around. It's essentially a quest story, inside an animation which can sometimes go a long time without being noticed, so to have a quest story in an animation is quite a thing. There are several moments when this can be considered scary, but also it has moments when it will just lift your heart play it a little tune and it won't stop until after the credits roll, and there are some moments when the tune will get a little sad and you might even let a tear two as Kubo goes on his perilous journey. Following the same standard as the other animations from Laika (ParaNorman which had a creepy atmosphere, and the Boxtrolls which had a poor boy trying to make his life better, in case you were wondering). This has a wonderful story much like the other two adventures. Kubo (Art Parkinson) is a boy living in a cave with his mother after the death of his late father he is a street performer by day, a charming shot which shows him using origami figures and bringing them to life with his guitar which goes on for some time as a beautiful music montage. After the day's job he must return to the cave before nightfall as the spirits chasing will be able to know where he is. There are some very dark moments especially with some of the evil spirits including the ghost sisters both voiced by Rooney Mara (with a very creepy tone), they add a lot of dark moments including something sad happening which we won't spoil. Other than the dark moments which is a common trait with Laika but also boasts big laughs which will have you laughing for ages, which add a few feel good moments to the story so, essentially the story is balanced between laughs, scary moments and sadness. There are also a few lighthearted moments mainly between Kubo and his mother who's very distraught that her husband is gone, however she still manages to tell Kubo that he must fight for everything he loves. It's beautifully animated (keep your eyes on how Kubo's hair moves in the wind), but also the other people and creatures, they add a lot of dark moments including something sad happening which we won't spoil. Other than the dark moments, there are two companions that Kubo meets, a stubborn Monkey (Charlize Theron) based on Kubo's wooden monkey that he keeps on his person and a heavily armoured beetle (Matthew McConaughey) who fought in his father's army these two characters are very charming in every way, even adding some funny moments when you'll laugh for ages the part when the Beetle is struggling to get up is especially funny. Carrying on with the fun there is also some funny dialogue mainly said by the two companions these moments are lighthearted, charming and a whole bunch of fun it almost makes you forget about the dark moments to come. Interestingly the story has a mixture of myth and legend, with some giant things roaming around for example a giant skeleton which looks more like one of the skeletons with a wobbly mouth from The Corpse Bride still with some fun moments and even an escalated amount of threat to this.As the story goes on we are introduced to an absolutely stunning landscape and as we get more to the end, there are dizzying sword battles which is when we start to feel for the characters as the threat is escalated even higher with another sad moment and a sort of thrill that nobody will expect. The final act is probably the scariest having (light) horror as there is a creepy villain the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes, in possibly his shortest role yet but still as sinister as ever) the final fight is gripping, dark, ghostly (pun intended) and very beautiful but it doesn't last too long. While there are noticeable shifts in tone  the seriousness of the first 15 minutes give way to increasingly broader comedy as Kubo adds companions to his quest  it has a truly undeniable emotion at its heart. Including a very happy ending that is very memorable as Kubo restores peace to the local village and he is seen as a hero. This, story proves that Laika is America's last stop for stop-motion animation with this charming, dark, if at times faultless story about a young boy. It's a very enjoyable and fun mythical animated tale.VERDICT: A charming and cherishable animation with smarts, humour, and some dark moments is a downright good time yet another beautiful animated success from stop-motion giants Laika.8/10 absolutely stunning."
211,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,7 September 2016,Masterpiece of Animation and Family Friendly,"Kubo follows in the footsteps of timeless fables.Little Kubo is eleven. He lives in a cave with his mother, and he earns a living telling stories with the help of origami characters animated by magic.Kubo and his mother must hide from Kubo's grandfather. His grandfather is the Moon King. The Moon King has stolen Kubo's left eye, and wants to take his right eye. The eyes serve as a surrogate for the soul: As in, 'the eyes are the windows to the soul.' Stealing Kubo's eyes will deprive Kubo of his ability to see the good of the mortal world and of mortals. i.e. He would not be able to see truth, justice, or any other reality beyond the surface of material objects.Since his grandfather is the Moon King, he rules the night sky, and Kubo must not stay out after dark. Naturally, he does so while trying to contact the spirit of his father. (That's a clue if you've not seen the film. Pay attention.) As in all fables or fairy tales, Kubo's mistake costs him dearly. His grandfather finds him, and sends his aunts to take his remaining eye. From there the movie becomes an action-quest worthy of any hero.Action and violence: Older children have seen far worse unless they are extraordinarily sheltered, but small children might be upset by the loss of a parent or strong action images.The film is entirely clean of sexual innuendo or profanity. The only scene in the film that might trigger a prudish nature involves a fire-breathing chicken.Animation is fantastic, and easily compares to the best out there. Scenes are often staged at twilight with a Barbizon light - the soft golden glow of sunset - which enhances the fairy tale quality.Musical accompaniment is soft and unobtrusive. It's a delight to listen to, and it enhances scenes without drowning out the dialogue or the sound effects.Voice acting was excellent. No attempt was made to inject faux accents into the oriental themed movie.The film reflects many elements of Shintoism, Buddhism, and some Hollywood spins on these religious traditions. Anyone with such a religious tradition should be warned not to expect authenticity. However: Unlike many films involving history, current events, etc., the filmmakers clearly respect the beliefs of the characters, and though these beliefs may not be fully authentic, they are not derogatory.Children of other faiths should not be too concerned, as the fantasy and fairy tale elements are substantially stronger than the overt religious elements - which ironically promote a non-materialistic view of the world.One last element this reviewer really appreciates: The complete lack of propaganda in the film. The only readily apparent bias in the film is the artistic decision to not denigrate the beliefs of the characters. Nor do the filmmakers apologize at any point for offering such a heart-warming - even sappy - view of the spiritual aspects of the story. Very few western cultural elements would get such a pass.Overall, one would have to be a real stick in the mud to fail to enjoy Kubo. Kubo is likely to become one of the favorite family-friendly children's flicks of all time. If not in the top 10 with Snow White, certainly it ranks with Miyazaki's films and with any of Disney's better offerings.Go see it. Take the kids."
212,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,6 September 2016,"A kid, a monkey, and a beetle walk onto a beach...","Kubo and the Two Strings is the movie of the year.Subverting clichés, tropes, and expectations, I was completely blown away by the deftness, wit, and heart of it.I walked in expecting a great film and walked away feeling emotionally wrung out. As the credits rolled I just sat in a daze considering what a great film I had seen.Kubo is as close to perfection as any film can hope to be. Real characters, a world all its own, rules that don't need explanation but just are, humor and heart mixed together seamlessly, and making pieces of paper actually interesting and relevant...This film is an artistic achievement that can only be borne from love of a craft.Kubo teaches us to value our time, to cherish and respect the memory of others, to appreciate a story, to innovate when necessary on the fly, and even to stand against family or those in authority if they have chosen an incorrect path.Kubo teaches us the importance of perspective, how we can choose our own path (""No, that is your story.""), and that we can choose to forgive. This movie is simultaneously uplifting and heart- wrenching.What made all the difference for this film is that the magic came from shared and mutual love, a love we see running deep from the opening moments as a young boy prepares food lovingly for his mother.I've seen some people using the word ""preachy"" to describe Kubo, but that is not what this film is. It is HEALTHY. It is REAL. It has HEART. It asks you to love what is here, right now, and also to love what has been, and to share it, and not forget it.Kubo is a love letter to family, to remembrance, and to being true to the nature of a situation. The following quote was played for jokes in the trailer and film, but it really showcases the respect the film has for its audience: ""I encourage you not to die."" Kubo knows it's dealing with some heavy subject matter, and it doesn't let up on the peril throughout, and it doesn't ever hold back from tugging on our (two?) heart strings, yet it plays those strings with such a deftness you don't even realize you've been played until you feel a tear on your cheek.Kubo and the Two Strings earns a resounding and unreserved 10/10. If you must blink, do it now, and run, don't walk, to see Kubo."
213,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,5 September 2016,"Beautiful, go see it... What are you waiting for??","I took my 17 year old to watch this stop-motion animation last weekend. Of course my daughter loved it. It had everything she enjoys, a rich story with all the twists and turns, funny, tender, and even scary moments. All that was masterly done with this interesting visual style that only stop-motion can render, where edges are sharp and colors and textures are rich and wide ranging. I may be old but I love animation, but only when it is creative, out of the norm, one might say ""fresh"". ""Kubo and the 2 strings"" is just that, although based on ancient Japanese story telling, it feels like a pumped up, redecorated, brought up to modern standard, old tale. I read in another review a complaint about the voice not sounding Japanese, but just plain American. Funny, it never occurred to me while watching it, as I was way too taken in by the story and the wonderful magical origami. Two hours passed without me wondering what time it was... Beautiful!"
214,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,4 September 2016,Origami heaven - powerful folktale.,"I'm not the target audience. But I love folktales and this is amazing...so expect the roller coaster ride of good versus evil as the hero struggles. Also I would NEVER forgive the bad guy as Kubo does... so don't hurt my family. The art work is so amazing - the origami effects - the characters - details too numerous to recall as I type this....my mind was so blown away at times. So to recap - origami heaven woven with a powerful folktale. Great for families so much to talk about after movie: family traditions, and customs that keep the families together even far apart. Honoring departed family members."
215,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,2 September 2016,Most moving film of the year,"""If you must blink, do it now.""Once again, Laika gives us a hero worthy of the story he is in. Kubo is a child, but as we see in the beginning of the film, his circumstances make him so much older. We don't see a boy burdened with the task of taking care of his mother; we see Kubo, selflessly cooking for and feeding her, tucking her in at night, pushing hair out of her eyes so that she can watch a world that she may or may not be seeing. It's easy to imagine that this is the entirety of Kubo's life, but then we hear the distant ring of a morning bell. Kubo goes to the village and that's when we learn what kind of story we're in. It's a world of heroes and music and origami and magic. The detail of the animation is already striking, but when the paper figures come to life at the bidding of Kubo's instrument it's downright baffling. Stop motion animation is exactly what it sounds like: one picture, a slight movement; another picture, another slight movement; until there's enough for a scene to unfold. And now I understand why it took five years to make Kubo. The intricacy of movement and design is insane, and I found myself several times asking in wonder, ""How the heck did they DO this?""I don't want to give away too much, but you do learn in the first few minutes of the film that Kubo is missing an eye. You might think that would put the animators at a disadvantage, but the variety and depth of his expressions, even with just the one eye is exquisite. I find it difficult to say in brief what I adore most about Kubo's character, if it's his bravery and tenacity, his admiration of the natural world, or merely the way he chooses to use his magic.There are so many moments that tugged at my heart, and none more so then when we learn what the two strings are. As someone who'd been looking forward to this movie since the title was announced, that moment is and will always be precious to me. I'll have to let you discover it for yourself. Be warned, the movie has a PG rating, but like Paranorman and Coraline before it, some of Kubo and the Two Strings may be frightening to young children. Personally, I think the younger me would have loved it just as much as this me does.""And that really is the least of it."""
216,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,31 August 2016,"Kubo goes on an adventure to search for the magic armor,","This movie was an amazing masterpiece because it is visually appealing with intense bouts of action and fantasy. One could only marvel so very closely at the detail that was put into this film, and i thoroughly enjoyed the subtle hints of suspense and comedy. Kubo will have you mesmerized by a character that is very relatable and humble.The way this film put into detail how each character is made is simply remarkable.(Possible Spoiler) Backstory is the main point in the film and each character is revealed as to how they came to be who they are. I witnessed this movie in 3-d as well and it was a fun experience getting to see the characters like they were right along side of you throughout the entirety of the film. See for yourself if this movie will make your deepest imagination come through and find out if this adventure is the one for the ages."
217,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,31 August 2016,A work of art that should be seen.,I never reviewed anything before on here. I wanted to add my review to this page to help Kubo gain more attention and hope to raise the rating overall. I've read a few reviews that discuss Kubo as a movie. Kubo is not just a movie. This is a masterpiece of art that is nothing short of its own kind of Mona Lisa. My jaw dropped within the first 5 minutes. I thought this was made with all CGI but I was stunned when I learned that Kubo was made with miniatures that are handcrafted. It truly is an act of love from the filmmakers to the audience. How many movies take 5 years to make by hand? I can't wait to see it again!
218,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,30 August 2016,One of the best animated films in quite some time and a gauntlet thrown by Laika Entertainment.,"KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS (2016) **** (VOICES OF: Charlize Theron, Art Parkinson, Ralph Fiennes, George Takei, Cary-Hioyuki Tagawa, Brenda Vaccaro, Rooney Mara, Matthew McConaughey, Meyrick Murphy, Minae Noji, Alpha Takahashi, Laura Miro) Amazing stop-motion animation propels this uniquely original (Thank God!) story about a young boy (Parkinson) who faces domestic dilemmas involving family (notably his nefarious grandfather and witch aunts hellbent on stealing his other eye) while employing his mad skills for storytelling that literally comes to life. Well crafted by a fun and dark screenplay by Marc Haimes, Chris Butler & Shannon Tindle escalates the adventure thanks to skillful direction by Travis Knight and a game blue-chip cast including Theron as a fierce monkey protector and McConaughey as a warrior cursed as a full-scale beetle (go with it). One of the best animated films in quite some time and a gauntlet thrown by Laika Entertainment."
219,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,29 August 2016,Now Top Favorite from LAIKA,"After seeing the trailer, I have been curious about this film from the film-makers that brought us ""Coraline."" After seeing it with a couple of friends, I thought this animated film aesthetically beautiful and top favorite from Laika.In ancient Japan, living in a mountain cave on the shore, young Kubo takes care of his ailing mother by earning money telling stories to the villagers, by a magical shamisen that manipulates paper into origami figures. His story tells of a samurai warrior and his battle with the Moon King. But at the sound of the evening bell, Kubo has to leave for home without finishing the story. At night, Kubo asks his mother about his father, who was the samurai from his story. Mother reveals that his father was killed by the Moon King, who is Kubo's grandfather. The Moon King had taken one of Kubo's eyes when he was an infant. And his mother flees with him from her father and her two sisters. She then warns Kubo not to go outside at night, or his grandfather and aunts would find him. The next day, on the festival of Obon, Kubo made a lantern for his father. He waited for a light, but no light appeared. Things got worse when he forgot to listen for the evening bell and it became dark. The two daughters of the Moon King appear and chase Kubo. But Kubo's mother appears, and with the last of her magic powers made the beetle from Kubo's robe fly him to safety before her end. Kubo wakes up in a snowy blizzard, and meets Monkey, who had been a little wooden monkey charm for Kubo before she was brought to life by his mother's magic. Inside a whale's carcass, Monkey tells Kubo that she is going to help him find the three pieces of the magical armor, which would help him defeat his grandfather. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.So overall, this is one of the best animated movies of the year, with plenty of fantasy, adventure, humor, shocking surprises and beautiful animation."
220,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,29 August 2016,Delightful animation but weak story line,"Being a huge fan of Laika Studios movies I was incredibly excited to see Kubo and the Two Strings. Whereas Laika's best films Coraline and ParaNorman take place in a Western society, Kubo and the Two Strings is focused on Japanese culture. This made me very curious because I wanted to see what movies outside of their usual genre would look like. In general I really enjoyed watching the movie. This was mostly due to the incredibly animation. Laika's stop motion animation never ceases to amaze me. The film had the most beautiful scenes and the animation quality has progressed a lot since Coraline. Secondly, Kubo and the Two Strings had the same amazingly creepy vibe Coraline and ParaNorman had, which made it not suitable for kids but really entertaining for adults. However, even though the animation style was the reason I went to see this movie it was not enough to make it a good movie. In my opinion the film seriously lacked in a good story line. At the beginning I felt like I was dropped right in the middle of something. I hoped that eventually all the questions I had at the beginning would be answered but instead I got even more questions. More characters were put into the story without a proper introduction and background story, which resulted in me not caring much for them. A sudden switch in genre with the introduction of the not-so-funny-Beetle resulted in annoyance, as most of the humor was out of place and too much. Lastly, the story line was extremely predictable from the beginning. I was hoping that the writers were trying to trick the viewer into thinking the predictable but then ending up with a different story, but alas. In conclusion I would like to recommend Kubo and the Two Strings to those who want to see some absolutely stunning stop-motion animation. Those who seek a movie comparable to Coraline and ParaNorman better stay home."
221,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,28 August 2016,Kubo and the Nine Stars,"""If you must blink, do it now."" So fittingly opens the stop-motion fantasy Kubo and the Two Strings, against a black screen soon to be filled with a 90+ minute roller coaster of cinematic emotions. Excitement (giant skeleton monsters), humor (sentient origami), terror (Shining-like twin sisters), romance (cross-species), and tears (the danger of family love) serenade every surprising moment of this Imaginative tale. Even with character conveniences and exposition, commonplace in the fantasy genre, Kubo is masterful filmmaking that far exceeds typical family-friendly animated features, or most others for that matter. Unlike most of what we get in theaters these days, Kubo has the audacity to be something that exists outside of our cultural subconscious. Its originality and tone give it the potential to have a Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-esque effect on audience. It's the story of a boy with a life-giving guitar and a mysterious past, forced upon an adventure with a beetle-man samurai (McConaughey) and a wonderfully wry talking monkey (Theron). Under its character-based humor and blistering action, it makes powerfully pointed statements about the inevitability of death, and love's ability to almost musically unite people in overcoming fear. Oh, and did I mention that the animation is perfectly gorgeous in every single way? Laika Studios (Coraline, Paranorman) have always matched their stunningly groundbreaking animation with stories that are among the best in kid's entertainment, and Kubo may be their best yet. With sweeping landscapes punctuated by seemingly innocuous little details filling their cinematic world of magic and adventure, it may be about time we start seeing Laika as the next Pixar. Kubo is the perfect respite from the dirge of summer franchises."
222,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,28 August 2016,Family fare with substance enough for adults,"Gathered with movie club friends from our old neighborhood last night and watched ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" - worthy entertainment. The visuals are continually clever, the challenges of the hero's journey are always surprising, and the moral resolution of the journey is hopeful. Produced by the studio that gave us ""Coraline,"" ""Kubo"" is a great stop-motion animation that is almost too scary for little kids (there were some in the audience, but nobody screamed) but a worthy evening for adults. The story is set in old Japan and revolves around young Kubo and his parents (sort of) and a lot of dangerous spirit world nemeses. Enjoy the visuals and stay through the closing credits."
223,Kubo and the Two Strings,7,28 August 2016,"Nicely made movie, but American audience won't like it","How could the producers of this movie be so foolish to NOT realize that American audiences will not be able to identify with a story based on Japanese characters? I couldn't relate to any character at all, even though I am an immigrant. Please don't get me wrong. I have great respect for Japanese . But I couldn't relate to y he characters or the place. How then could the local audience? The makers must understand where their core audience is.... But apparently they didn't. Cost them heavily. The movie has bombed at the box office because of the reason I've cited here. If they'd asked experts like me before making the movie, I would have screamed ""Dont do it!!!"" That being said, was a nice movie....made for the WRONG audience."
224,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,25 August 2016,Excellent Movie With great Story and Messenger !!!,i saw this movie in 3D it has Great Action and Visual Wonderful and animation the story tells about boy name kubo has powers and lives with his mother who try protect him from her evil sisters witches and Sends kubo in another dimension must learn how to use his powers and Save the World From Dangerous also in beginning it shows kubo mother sail on ocean with kubo as baby we learn somebody took kubo another eye so he is blind only see out of one eye don't show eye be take out ! i really love this movie it had great characters its very Action Packed there is allot of violence the movie is more dark toned then another kids movies it has some emotional deaths is surprise there is blood but fans of Coraline Corpse Bride and Paranorman will definitely enjoy this movie !!!! in my opinion this less intense then Coraline And Paranorman !!! if kid has seen marvel movies think can handle this or any other movies i list here !!
225,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,23 August 2016,Magical,"There's great filmmaking and then there's the breathtakingly great filmmaking that Laika studios has continued to put out. With mind- blowing stop-motion sequences that rival anything Pixar does, and a heavy focus on a creative story, Kubo and the Two Strings may be the best that Laika has had to offer to date.Kubo and the Two Strings tells the story of Kubo, a young boy searching for a mysterious set of armor needed to defeat a vicious spirit set on killing him. It's much darker than Laika's previous effot, Boxtrolls, but it ends up having something for people of all ages. Matthew McCconaughey and Charlize Theron play Beetle and Monkey respectively, who accompany Kubo on his quest. They both provide well-timed comedic relief, which luckily never steps too far into the goofy kid humor realm. Other than the brilliant animation, Kubo provides us with a refreshingly poignant animated feature for people of all ages. Besides Zootopia and Finding Dory, there hasn't really been an animated film that impressed, especially one that spread out its humor and story arcs amongst age groups. It's worth noting that this was McConaughey's first time doing voice over, which should give you an idea of how impressed he was with the script.It's not going to wow audiences with over-the-top colors and forced potty-jokes, but it has a big heart with woeful ideas that may top even the best of what Pixar as to offer. Kubo and the Two Strings is a filmmaking gem, and easily one of 2016's best.+Poignant+Breathtaking animation+Fun journey+Well-timed humor8.6/10"
226,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,23 August 2016,A refreshingly different - and visually spectacular - family flick.,"Operating in the niche market of stop-motion filmmaking, Laika Entertainment have produced yet another sweet, thoughtful and visually sensational adventure that ranks behind only Coraline (a masterpiece) on Laika's resume. But whereas their previous four films  also including Corpse Bride, ParaNorman and Boxtrolls  have existed in the realm of the horror genre, the mystical and Oriental-flavoured Kubo sees the studio branch out into foreign territory. Following our titular young protagonist on his quest to locate magical items in order to defeat the enigmatic Moon King, the story tackles themes of love, loss and growing up, astutely balancing on an emotional razor edge that is simultaneously heart breaking and heart warming. There is sporadic humour but it's rarely hilarious, the focus clearly being on conveying a tale of substance and wonder  a goal that's undeniably achieved albeit at the cost of potentially boring younger audience members on the odd occasion. Kubo himself (voiced by Art Parkinson) is someone who you can barrack for and invest in, a charismatic and energetic kid wise beyond his years (but mercifully not precocious) who is hiding an immaturity underneath the resilient façade. Joining the voyage are Monkey (Charlize Theron) and Beetle (Matthew McConaughey), the former an overprotective warrior and the latter a bumbling but sweet natured do-gooder who fails to connect due to McConaughey's incredibly recognisable voice. The stop-motion animation is unsurprisingly breathtaking, the Eastern setting rendered with beautiful and meticulous detail whilst the character designs are stunning in both concept and execution. The sinister twin sisters who hunt Kubo are particularly spectacular, their floating visages and porcelain-masked faces combined with Rooney Mara's haunting voice performance simply oozes creepiness. The two big action sequences featuring the twin sisters are amazing, the first an epic showdown on a sinking ship and the second a deadly feud in an abandoned temple courtyard, both astonishingly brutal for a PG-rated movie. An affecting, sincere and delightful journey that credits its audience  children and adults alike  with intelligence and maturity, Kubo and the Two Strings is a refreshingly different family flick."
227,Kubo and the Two Strings,9,22 August 2016,Best animated movie of the year,"OK, so it's a bit premature to call Laika's latest masterpiece the best animated picture of the year, especially given that Disney's Moana has yet to come out, but I find it hard to believe that any other animated film this year can match the originality and the quality animation of Kubo and the Two Strings.Kubo is a more somber story than we're used to seeing in animated movies. Kubo and his mother deal with the death of Kubo's father while seeking refuge from Kubo's evil grandfather, the moon king, a god like creature who lives in the heavens and can only come to Earth at night. Kubo's mother was once an immortal princess who fell in love with a common man, Hanzo, and together they had a mortal son, Kubo. Her father, the Moon King, considers this a betrayal, and seeks to steal Kubo's eyes in order to turn Kubo into an immortal creature like himself. Kubo's mother is injured during her escape from the Moon Kingdom and she develops a kind of Alzheimer's like condition where her memories fade and she is immobile during the day. Kubo takes care of her as she literally stares into space  it's pretty deep stuff for a kid's movie. Kubo and his mother manage to fend off the Moon King and his two evil daughters for a few years, but eventually they are found. His mother uses her last bit of magic to send Kubo far away and enchants a monkey doll to come alive and protect him. Along the way, Kubo and the monkey meet a giant beetle, a former Samurai who was cursed by the Moon King. Together, they have to find an indestructible sword and magic armor with which they can defeat the Moon King. Kubo is not defenseless, however, as he uses a magic guitar that can create and control origami figures to fight off the Moon King and his minions (it comes in handy, trust me). Make no mistake, the animation is this film's crowning achievement. Laika does brilliant stop motion animation, which is such a nice change from the abundance of computer-animated movies we see nowadays. The scenery and the characters come to life in a way that CGI can't capture. There are some very scary images here, like Kubo's flying Aunts who wear Japanese versions of Guy Fawkes masks (there may be a real term for their masks, I just don't know it). While the animation is excellent, the story is not to be discounted either. Kubo and the Two String's themes of loss and the strength that we can derive from the memory of deceased family members make for a very moving story, and it deals with these themes in a way that is not too manipulative or cookie cutter. There are also plenty of laughs along the way. The antics between Kubo, the monkey (voiced by Charlise Theron), and the beetle (Matthew McConaughey) are very funny. I do think that the story could have been tighter. Kubo gives a heavy-handed speech about the power of family at the end of the movie that I don't think we were adequately prepared for, for instance. But you can certainly understand why the speech is there, and the movie has so much else going for it I really didn't mind. It's a shame this movie isn't doing better at the box office. Maybe it's bad marketing, but I think Laika's animation style and darker kid's stories are simply not appealing to American audiences. This is unfortunate as their movies are more intelligent than most American animated films. I hope the studio endures. So go out and see Kubo and the Two Strings! We need to reward intelligent movies!"
228,Kubo and the Two Strings,8,22 August 2016,Better than I first gave it credit for,"This film is good, it might be the coolest looking animated film in a long time. it is beautiful, and stop motion captures the characters perfectly in each demeanor. The timing of sequences is great and the story - though it has its weak points - was thoroughly riveting.My problem was a personal one. I have to say that the film struck me as incredibly preachy, to the point of being zealous, and it frustrated me as initially it felt like preaching was its purpose. However, upon reflection, this film is preaching, but not what I would consider zealously. the film highlights the idea that there are no endings over and over again. it also highlights the power of memory, and the strength stories give you. To tell this story well, with respect to the Japanese folklore roots, this tale had to delve into the supernatural, and should, as the supernatural is a excellent story telling tool.On the whole the film exceeds expectations in almost every facet - the plot initially falls agonizingly short but regains composure, the characters are amazing... Monkey! and the twists, though I saw them coming; were clever, well thought through, flowed with the plot, and made the film more interesting."
229,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,22 August 2016,"Beautiful is the only word that defines Kubo and the Two Strings. It's animation, story and emotion make it one of the best of 2016","2016 has been an impressive year for animation. Disney hit it out of the park with Zootopia and Finding Dory, not to mention they have another one coming later with Moana. DreamWorks gave us more spiritualism from Kung Fu Panda 3, Universal scored a hit with The Secret Life of Pets, and Sony took chances with The Angry Birds Movie and Sausage Party. It seems that more people are responding to animation then they are the live action movies. Being that I'm already a fan of animation, this is good news as I want more material like this coming out. For today's movie, the magicians from Laika have returned.Laika is the company who has brought a new revival of stop motion animation. They have crafted the beautiful stories of Coraline, Paranorman, and The Boxtrolls. I compare these guys to Studio Ghibli as they both craft original stories, have never produced sequels, are full of stunning animation, carry some big name voices, and sadly are not major moneymakers. These movies speak to children and adults while providing some great messages, so I hope the marketing will get better of their latest does well. Their next story is a Japanese centered tale called Kubo and the Two Strings. On top of a mountain below a village, a boy named Kubo takes care of his mother who suffers lapses in memory. During the day, he travels into the village where he uses his guitar to tell stories through the magic of paper origami figurines that come to life. At night, when she's alert, Kubo will ask his mother questions and spend as much time as he can with her while obeying her rule to never leave the cave after sunset. During a ceremony that honors the dead, he accidentally stays out later then usual, causing him to be found by his aunts (both played by Rooney Mara).Kubo is nearly caught, but his mother temporarily stops them and sends him away to find his father's armor. He awakens in a snowstorm where a talking monkey (played by Charlize Theron) is there to help. She explains that she was that little wooden charm that he carried until his mother's magic brought her to life. The two set off to find his father armor, in which their also joined by a beetle-hybrid man samurai (played by Matthew McConaughey). They hope that the armor will stop Kubo's grandfather, the Moon King (played by Ralph Fiennes) from taking over the land.This is a tough synopsis to transcribe as a lot of it relies on being spoiler-free. Without giving away the major points, Kubo and the Two Strings is another work of beauty from Laika. I have to first give credit to it's animation which again is just gorgeous. From the warmth of the village to the scares that it's dark characters to the living origami, this is a visual treat. This is one of the few movie's I'd to have liked to have seen a work in progress version of, just to appreciate the hard work these animators have put in. While it was a risk to cast mainly Caucasian actors to play Japanese, they all feel right. They all manage to bring a lot of personality, humor, and emotion into a very complex story. The journey that Kubo is on really pushes him, especially during the last thirty minutes, so everything feels earned. Every laugh and tear feels genuine and shows that this studio knows that children can take more then most people realize. While the villain's motivation is a little vague, it's only a small mark as this movie deserves to be a hit.I'll give this ten origami figurines out of ten. Kubo and the Two Strings is now the only movie in Zootopia's way that could block it from an Oscar. I cannot phrase it enough as one of the best movies of 2016. All I can say is to consider the shape of things and see this beautiful movie. Just don't spoil it, please."
230,Kubo and the Two Strings,10,20 August 2016,Lika At It's Best!,"This movie deserves an Oscar. I know they will give to the big $ Disney, Pixar or maybe DreamWorks, but Kubo and the Two Strings is marking new and greater creative ground for Lika. The use of sound alone (traditional Japanese music to approach climaxes of action as well as softer instances of contemplation) is noteworthy and unusual for any genre. The story seemed complete and emotionally driven and gives a small unlikely band on a quest against impossible odds. Since it is large budget stop-motion it is meticulous and beautiful in it's craft but the characters have expression and depth. These qualities should be shared with a a wider audience (adults and kids alike). I was unsure of how the studio would handle such an Asian-centric styled story (I mean come-on, Matthew McConaughey? (No he does NOT say ""All right, all right, all right!"") but it didn't feel like a cultural affectation and both the dialogue and the acting were excellent. I will be buying this when it comes out on DVD and telling everyone how much I liked it. I would say my favorite character was Monkey. The themes of community through the village and family were there to enrich the story but they didn't seem overly saccharin as sometimes animated pieces can be. I would sum it up as a beautiful action movie with a heart that is animated..."
