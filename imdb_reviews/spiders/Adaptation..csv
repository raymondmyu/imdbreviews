0,Adaptation.,9,1 October 2004,The ending,"I've read many of the comments regarding Adaptation, and it seems as though most people have disliked this movie because of its ending. They make claims such as, ""Kaufman's script was great until the end,"" or, ""Why did Kaufman talk about not wanting to ""hollywoodize"" his script, and then do it in the end anyway?""I don't think most people understand why he did it.Throughout the movie, Kaufman's character keeps stressing how much he doesn't want to make a ""Hollywood"" film. Hollywood-type films have sex, drugs, car chases, and most importantly, characters who succeed in the end. So at a glance, it seems that Kaufman goes against his inner most desires regarding the film because he does ""hollywoodize"" it. But that is what I find to be the most clever part of his screenplay. To explain my point, try to imagine this-what if Kaufman did not ""hollywoodize"" his script? If he didn't do it, Kaufman would not have added car chases, sex, and drugs. So in a way, if this were the case, Kaufman would have succeeded. But you see, that is the point. Kaufman DID NOT want his character to succeed in the end. Like he explained throughout the movie, ""I don't want to have a film...where characters succeed in the end."" Thus, since Kaufman ultimately fails at his attempt to adapt Susan Orlean's book into a screenplay in how he originally intended, he delivers a screenplay that is not your normal hollywood film, i.e., a film where the protagonist prevails.Basically, in order to make his film ""un-hollywood,"" he ""hollywoodizes"" it. Can nobody see the genius of this? Anyway, I just thought that I could offer everyone my take on the movie so that you all may perceive Kaufman's ending in a different light."
1,Adaptation.,9,20 July 2007,"""The script I'm starting, it's about flowers. No one's ever done a movie about flowers before.""","After the phenomenal success of 'Being John Malkovich' in 1999, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was commissioned to adapt Susan Orlean's non-fiction novel, ""The Orchid Thief,"" for the screen. However, it didn't take long for him to realise that Orlean's book was basically unfilmable, its sprawling and ponderous story lacking any clear structure or coherence. After some months of struggling vainly to write a screenplay from the novel, Kaufman's script inexplicably became the story of a writer's effort to adapt an unadaptable novel. Kaufman's completed script was presented to his financial backers with some trepidation, but they reportedly loved it so much that they decided to abandon the original project and film his screenplay. Spike Jonze, who had also directed ""Being John Malkovich,"" returned to direct ""Adaptation,"" the quirky, twisting, self-referential film that received almost universal critical acclaim. Much like Federico Fellini's classic 1963 film, '8½,' from which Kaufman almost certainly drew inspiration, 'Adaptation' tells the story of its own creation.Nicolas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman, the lonely, insecure and socially awkward screenwriter who is hired to adapt ""The Orchid Thief,"" written by Susan Orlean, who is portrayed by Meryl Streep. The novel itself concerns the story of John Laroche (played by Chris Cooper), a smug plant dealer who was arrested in 1994 for poaching rare orchids in the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. As Kaufman struggles to write the script, his troubles are compounded by the presence of his twin brother, Donald (also played by Nicolas Cage), who is Charlie's exact opposite: reckless, carefree, over-confident and perhaps even a bit dim. The script for 'Adaptation' darts back and forth between different moments in time, either chronicling Kaufman's screen writing exploits or Orlean's experiences in writing her novel. At several points in the story, more dramatic flashbacks take place: we see Charles Darwin first penning his theories of evolution and adaptation, a brief history of the grim activity of orchid-hunting, and, in one particularly impressive sequence, we are taken back billions of years to the beginning of life, to trace how Charlie Kaufman came to be here today.Though purportedly based on a true story, the events of the film are highly fictionalised, and the story always treads a fine line with reality, with the audience never certain of whether or not an event is real (in the context of the film) or merely a creation of Charlie's (or even Donald's) imagination. Charlie Kaufman (the true-life writer, not the character) often receives most of the accolades for the film, but it is director Spike Jonze who shared the vision to execute ""Adaptation"" on screen. His approach to film-making is always original and daring, never tentative of trying something unique for the sake of the film, even if it may offend the tastes of an audience that is unaccustomed to anything other than the mundane clichés of the modern movies that are churned out daily by Hollywood studios. If this wasn't completely obvious after the weird, twisted, fascinating 'Being John Malkovich,' then 'Adaptation' put any lingering doubts to rest. The director, who started his career directing music videos, seems to share a singular understanding with Kaufman the writer, and a mutual agreement on what the film is actually trying to say.In addition to a clever story, 'Adaptation' contains some of the finest acting of the 2000s, presenting an excellent selection of seasoned talents at the top of their games. In arguably the greatest role(s) of his career, Nicolas Cage is phenomenal as both Charlie and Donald Kaufman, twin brothers whose complete polarity is startlingly evident in the execution of their respective film scripts. Charlie, whilst writing his adaptation, is determined to avoid the usual clichés and construct a film without any conventional plot, to write a movie ""simply about flowers."" Donald, however, blissfully oblivious to his own unoriginality as a writer, churns out a hackneyed psychological thriller, entitled 'The 3,' in which the serial killer, his female hostage and the cop are the very same person. In an ironic twist of fate, Donald's trite treatment is hailed as a masterpiece, adding further to the inadequacy already being felt by his disillusioned brother. Cage is excellent, and often absolutely hilarious, as both characters, giving each brother a distinct attitude and personality, so that it is possible to tell immediately which is which even though their physical appearance is exactly the same.Meryl Streep is equally excellent as Susan Orlean, the journalist for ""The New Yorker"" who researches John Laroche and endeavours to catch a glimpse of the famed and very rare Ghost Orchid, if only to understand what it feels like to be passionate about something. Chris Cooper arguably steals the entire show as the charismatic and enigmatic Laroche, whose tragedy-afflicted life is dedicated to mastering numerous obscure fields (such as orchid-collecting, or fish-collecting), each of which is sporadically cast aside and permanently forgotten as soon as he feels it's time to move on, to ""adapt"" to another hobby. From four Academy Award nominations, only Cooper walked away with a statue. Notably, Charlie Kaufman's screenplay was also nominated for an Oscar. Since the script was credited to both ""Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman,"" the latter became the only entirely fictional person in history to have been nominated for an Academy Award.In a nutshell, 'Adaptation' is all about failure. Charlie Kaufman is absolutely determined to write an original script, without cramming in ""sex or guns or car chases or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end."" However, after he eventually asks Donald to complete the script for him, it descends into exactly that. A visit to a screen-writing seminar by Robert McKee (memorably played by Brian Cox)  who is famous for warning strongly against Deus Ex Machina  is used as exactly that. Charlie Kaufman the character fails miserably in writing his script, but, ironically, Charlie Kaufman the writer succeeds ever so magnificently!"
2,Adaptation.,9,21 May 2004,Clever... too clever?,"John Laroche (an excellent, award-winning Chris Cooper) is a plant lover, specialized in orchids. Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) writes a story about it, and later a book. Charlie Kaufman (the always cool Nicholas Cage) has to adapt the book to a screenplay.Basicly, that's the story right there. But this movie comes with so many twists, it's hard to catch up.First of, Susan Orlean and her book really exist. As does Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine o/t Spotless Mind). In fact, Kaufman has written this movie. So Kaufman wrote a movie about Kaufman writing a movie. You get it? Then there's the fact that all storylines are happening at the same time (think The Hours). Add to that the twin brother Donald Kaufman, who's also writing some parts. Or is he...? Does he even exist at all?The most confusing (and amusing) part is that movie-Kaufman (that's Cage) is talking about making this movie. He's telling himself 'we open with a van on the highway' and we've actually seen that part. It goes even beyond that, when we hear him talk to his recorder: 'Charlie Kaufman is talking to his recorder'. I loved that part.But it's a movie you have to go along with. Kaufman and Jonze try desperately to be clever and they've managed to do so. It's one of the most original movies of the last ten years, but I'm sure it's not for all tastes. If you like Being John Malkovich you should probably give it a go though.My score: 8/10."
3,Adaptation.,10,26 April 2005,I get it now.,"The first time I saw ""Adaptation"" I expected something else and walked away severely disappointed. As some of you out there who Private Messaged me in regards to my initial review posted on IMDb might already be aware, I originally gave it a rating of 3.5/5 stars, back when I was frequently contributing to the site. I passed on without much thought, considering it a disappointment and leaving my critique for those who cared to read it.It remains the single comment to have generated the most feedback for me. More than ""The Passion of the Christ,"" and more than yes, even my upsetting review of 2003's ""Peter Pan"" (which seemed to anger the small die-hard fanbase for the film that lurks on these message boards - by the way, I've had to clarify this sentence by adding ""for the film"" because someone PM'd me yesterday accusing me of implying I have a fanbase on IMDb...no, I am referring to the film's fanbase, so please hold off on the accusations). I digress. In summary I gave ""Adaptation"" a negative rating and to my surprise, perhaps because I avoided totally slamming the film, the fans responded to me with kind words rather than harsh ones; conceivably they too had initially taken a dislike to the film? I made a daring move. I bought ""Adaptation"" on DVD for ten bucks, thinking, ""I've got nothing to lose."" Plus, the front cover looked cool anyway.I watched it again (after taking into mind several themes and self-referential layers I had failed to visualize before) and was blown away by the originality and genius of the movie.My hugest complaint regarding ""Adaptation,"" originally, was its absurd ending -- I felt it was out of place, silly, and totally anti-climactic. Little did I realize this was the point -- to be a parody of the typical Hollywood blockbuster.There are so many underlying jokes, gags and self-references that the film grows better -- like ""Back to the Future"" -- on each new viewing. You're always finding new stuff.I found new respect for Nicolas Cage as an actor after my second viewing of this. I have always liked Cage despite the criticism he receives for being a one-sided actor; here, he proves he's capable of creating two very different human beings out of the same mold. Brilliant, Oscar-worthy stuff.All in all I got it wrong the first time. ""Adaptation"" isn't a film that starts out clever and descends into a messy and stupid finish. Well, actually, it is. But that's the point. I didn't get it before. Now I do.If you disliked this film, my advice? Watch it again. It knows a bit more about itself than you probably do. And read up on the message boards here a bit to get a clearer grasp of what's going on if you're totally clueless.P.S. I'd like to thank all the people on this site who messaged me in response to my review."
4,Adaptation.,10,15 March 2003,Could you be more Original?,"Incredible.Charlie Kaufman might just be the most genius screenwriter (I daren't say ever) at the moment. I mean, trying to adapt a book for a screenplay, not succeeding, yet in the process writing a screenplay about how you can't seem to adapt this book for a screenplay. Oh yeah, and also being helped by your not existing twin brother, and crediting him as co-writer, and being nominatad for an Oscar together with him.Is anyone following this?Kaufman seems to be the master of destroying the line between reality and fiction.I kind of have a hard time saying anything about this movie, because I don't know what to say. You should just go and say it. There's nothing like it.If you liked Being John Malkovic you wil definitely love this. If you hated BJM you might still like it. It doesn't have the absurdity and surreality of BJM. The story is just incredibly intelligently written.Even though the movie is about how Kaufman is unable to adapt this book, he actually succeeds in doing just that in the process.Jesus, I'm still totally stunned.Jonze does do a very good job once again. But the direction is just outshined by the story..."
5,Adaptation.,9,15 January 2003,Adapt Your Thinking,"While taking a break from studying for my calculus final (a brain-draining exercise to say the least), I sat down to write out this review on what was, no doubt about it, a brain-draining movie (in an offbeat but good way). Of course I expected this from `Adaptation', for last month, in every major magazine, it has been touted as a mind-twisting ride, which piqued my interest.	Charlie Kaufman (Nicholas Cage), by his own admission, is a loser. By my viewing, that's a fairly accurate description-if you add neurotic. Anyhow, Kaufman is a talented screenwriter, who, after writing what is his `script of a lifetime' (`Being John Malkovich), he takes on a project that is over his head-adapting Susan Orlean's (Meryl Streep) book, `The Orchid Thief' into an amazing film about flowers that will stun and amaze all.	The plot diverges here. One path follows Kaufman along the road to the inevitable breakdown of writer's block that forces him to jump from idea to idea in vain attempt to write a screenplay, until he commits the cardinal sin of screenwriting-writing himself into the script. This is not helped in the least by his hack brother Donald (Nicholas Cage) successfully working on his own script (a complete antithesis of his own).	The other road follows Orlean as she goes about writing her book three years earlier. The book is about a dentally challenged Floridian orchid thief, John Laroche (Chris Cooper), who is personable enough to cause Orlean to fall for him, his drugs, and his outside-the-law lifestyle.	As you might well imagine, this is not your usual Friday-night flick. The complexity of three separate, yet interwoven plots (Laroche the thief, Orlean writing about the thief and Kaufman writing about the writer writing about the thief) is stunning and the end, for those who will get it (I did not at first) will blow you away once it hits youI'll give you a bit of help in knowing why the ending works later on. Oh, and Charlie (but not Donald) Kaufman, Susan Orlean, and John Laroche are all real people, which will make the film infinitely easier to understand.	Nicholas Cage is amazing. To have to carry out the performances of two different characters is certainly a feat, but to do it with such widely disparate characters like the Kaufmans is really nothing less than wondrous. Not to be outdone, Meryl Streep is superb, especially in the third act of the movie when her character becomes a more physical one. As for Cooper, well, I don't want to insult the guy, but he comes across as a redneck hick and a shyster, which is exactly what the script demanded.	All glory praise and honor for these fine actors would be for naught, had it not been for director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman (see that name before?). What they have done is simply amazing and is a tribute to their brilliance. Visually, the film does not stand out much (except for the fast-action evolution sequences that are worth their while). In short, kudos to the entire staff.	I promised earlier to give you some help in figuring out why the ending worksbefore I thought of this nugget of info (instead of studying anti-derivatives), the ending had me confused and slightly angry. The key to the ending is in the opening credits, in the line `Written by Charlie and Donald Kaufman'. Good luck in comprehending the ending. I give this film my first 10 of the year."
6,Adaptation.,10,12 May 2007,"A Guide on ""How To Write A Screenplay"" and ""How to Live Life""","Jonze and Kaufman have pulled it off again. Witty, surreal, brilliant, inventive, amazing and most of all; the most inspirational film I have ever seen. One of the best and definitive films of the 21st Century.Nicolas Cage has two parts in this film, Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman, twin brothers. Both screen writers. Charlie is writing a screenplay based on a book called ""The Orchid Thief"" {a real book}. But nothing happens in it. He is finding it hard to stay true to the book when there's no events in the book. Writer's block. Meanwhile, Donald is storming through his screenplay which is about a serial killer with split personalities  a theme regularly used in cinema today. This is a take on how and why there are so many teen horrors with crappy ideas, while films that would appeal to a smaller audience are harder to conjure. During the course of Adaptation. we see Charlie's screenplay ""The Orchid Thief"" showing as it would if it became a film, featuring the author; Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) and the books protagonist, John Laroche (Chris Cooper).Charlie Kaufman {the character} is one of the most relatable characters in cinema for me. He too is looking for inspiration, something to help achieve his dreams, but he can't seem to find it. He waits for something to come and change his life for the good but never takes the opportunity. He worries about the most insignificant things that aren't life-changing. But the difference to me and Kaufman, is that he finds the way. In the end he has learnt his lesson and learnt how to live life. I am going to take the same advice. His narration gives us a very detailed guide of his feelings and thoughts.Nic Cage gives a redeeming performance and one of the best of his career as both Charlie and Donald. They are very different personality-wise, Charlie being nervous and frustrated, while Donald is almost too upbeat about everything. His chemistry with himself is incredible its hard to believe they are the same. Chris Cooper delivers an Oscar winning performance, and it sure was worthy. Very fun character, taking away his seriousness whenever he should be serious. Meryl Streep is also flawless, giving a performance which she shows her moods appropriate to the scene.Spike Jonze gives us a very interesting directional view. With a lot of tie-in's with Being John Malkovich (his previous film) to show us his own little world, where anything can happen. There are also a lot of tie-in's with the film itself in which Kaufman comes up with an idea for the script in the film, when it actually happens in this film (while his ideas are for ""The Orchid Thief""). And, of course, there is the strange factor in which Charlie Kaufman has included himself in his screenplay and in the film, the character Charlie Kaufman has included himself in his own screenplay. It is truly hard to believe how Kaufman comes up with this stuff.This may lack the dark style of ""Being John Malkovich"", but they are in the same world. Don't miss this moving comedy and hilarious drama. I can't help but get lost in its wonder.10/10"
7,Adaptation.,9,27 July 2003,Cage redeemed.,"A brilliant, original film, hilariously funny almost all the way through, which is why the end seems disjointed and a bit out of sync with the rest of the film...until you consider McKee's advice to Kaufman, the success of Donald's cliched script, and the pressure on Charlie Kaufman (in the film) to finish the script. So it suddenly becomes a thriller, there's drama added to a genuinely moving story and characters, and it seems to rush towards its ending unprepared. But that's the whole postmodern element of the film - is it deliberately bad and pat (like the Player - a much lesser film that doesn't stand up after repeated viewing)?Anyway, Cage is fantastic in this - really if the Oscars were about acting, he should have got it for articulating two characters brilliantly. After the mess of Captain Corelli's Mandolin, it's some achievement.
A must see - but you need to engage your brain for this!"
8,Adaptation.,8,16 October 2009,Plot Construction as Protagonist--but what a fascinating construct. Pure brain food.,"Adaptation (2002)I adapted. I evolved. My second take on this movie was a turnaround from the first, when I thought it was needlessly complicated and self-absorbed. After all, the lead character is the screenwriter, and he's so full of himself and his self-pitying diary entries he has an identical twin to double the narcissism. I remembered enjoying it, but thinking it wheedling and grad school ultra-clever, too.But that's not it at all. This is a movie that is all about plot construction but not about being inside the plot in the normal viewer-filmmaker way. For me, I couldn't just watch to see what was going to happen next. Things happen, there is a true climax of an ending, but it's how they happen that matters. The layering of time frames is paralleled by the layering of realities--until you realize that it's all real, and that the supposed movie being written is and isn't the movie we are watching. Or if it is, totally, and we see it's genesis on screen, it is still a screenplay about something real. Or not, once you see that the book, ""The Orchid Thief,"" which is a real book by Susan Orlean, is not ""Adaptation"" at all, but just a thread for Kaufman to weave these different personalities and plots together. Fiction or fact, who cares? Well, that's part of the film's cunning--there's even a cameo of John Malkovich at the start, and a shot of that famous Being John Malkovich set of the half sized floor 7 ½ in an office building. And for the record, there is a Ghost Orchid that grows in the Everglades, Polyrrhiza lindenii, and yes, you can now buy it legally from growers with greenhouses. But Charles Kaufman the very real screenwriter (Being John Malkovich, of course, and Synecdoche, New York) is played by an actor, Nicholas Cage, with Cage's usual nervous ticks and uneasiness. Perfect for this role.But does it all work? On the brain, yes. It's fascinating and engrossing, the work of a screenwriter showing off his chops. Is there suspense? Not really, even though it involves thieves and guns and romance. More telling, do we care about the characters? Nope again. Not for me. I'm curious about these people--Meryl Streep as the writer of the book, and Chris Cooper as the orchid thief are both right on--but not worried about their survival, in love or in life. Still, I had to see every minute because I wanted to see how these very disparate characters were used to construct the construction, to force a point.To say the movie isn't original or well done is foolish. The director? The redoubtable Spike Jonze, who seems to have let Kaufman lead the way, so the filming, per se, is excellent without being notable. You can't quite tell he's a television commercial director, but once you find that out it makes sense, and the movie is broken into short pieces not unlike your average t.v. experience.To say Adaptation isn't to your taste is, of course, very reasonable. But if you can watch it the way I did the second time, open to its inner meanderings and the jumping from layer to layer, open that is to the working of the narrative plot stripped bare, you'll be glued."
9,Adaptation.,10,12 January 2003,"I had a smirk on my face the whole time, well, not the whole time, you'll see.","I had the pleasure of seeing Adaptation earlier this evening.  Basic, Non-Spoiler review: Interesting Movie, despite what some say it is the most original screenplay of last year, and great acting on all counts.  I haven't liked Cage this much since Raising Arizona, and I actually wanted to bang Streep at one point in the film.By the way, this film does feature two of the most realistic and violent car crashes I've seen in a movie theater, which is why I wasn't smirking the whole time.  Great effect, but damn if I'll be driving with out wearing my seatbelt for the next 50 years.Anyway, time for spoilers... I'll head down a bit, but don't say I didn't warn you.Okay, still here?  Too bad, here we go.I want to read this script.  I've got a group of guys I went to High School with, and we're all into something film related at this point.  One wants to be a director/writer, the other an editor, and there's a character actor in there as well.  I like to consider myself a writer, but let's face it, I'm retarded.  Anyway, I dubbed myself the Jerry Bruckheimer of the group because I like big fancy action scenes and crap like that.
I'm Donald Kaufman.On the print I saw, and I'm not sure if anyone else's did this because I've only seen the film once mind you, but when Charlie calls Donald to ask him to come to New York, it looks like the film stock or filter completely changes.  That's where Donald starts writing the movie, in my opinion. Sure, Charlie gets in little bits of him here and there, but from that point on it's Donald.The spying, the drugs, the car chase, the romp in the swamp, gunplay, the turning of Cooper and Streep's characters into villains when they're anything but... Hell, it turned into a nightmarish Hardy Boys Adventure. I could almost read the phrase ""SUDDENLY!: An alligator attacks Laroche!"". Ah.  Sure, it's a bit pompous but hey, that last 30 odd minutes is one big joke on piss poor writers, like myself.Here's hoping Kaufman's next movie is ""THE THREE"", some could argue that the end result of this movie is ""The Three"", but come on-- Who wouldn't enjoy that idiotic story?"
10,Adaptation.,7,1 September 2003,Writer becomes anti-anti-hero writing about anti-hero,"Clever.  This movie is clever, sometimes stepping over into precious.  But if being overly precious is not high on your list of movie flaws (there are so many others), this movie may appeal to you, as it did to me.  If you're into semiotics, deconstruction, frame analysis or that kind of thing, there are some nice little jokes you'll enjoy.For anyone who has ever seriously pursued a creative vocation, especially writing, this movie will appeal.  If you are the kind of person who has gone to expensive seminars, hoping (along with hundreds of others) to transform your craft or your life, this movie will make you laugh.It is about a screenwriter who is trying to write something original, in a day and age when everything has been done so many times, even originality seems to have become clichéd.  He has a further problem, which is that he can't get out of his own head.  And he is neurotic.  He is hired by a major motion picture studio to do something almost impossible: write an adaptation of a non-fiction book about orchids so that it can be a regular Hollywood film.  It sounds like a stupid thing for a studio to hire a writer to do, but of course, that's exactly what the Studio did with this film. Adaptation is based on the work of New Yorker writer, Susan Orlean.  She is played by Meryl Streep in the movie.  The real life Susan Orlean had her scenes cut out of the movie (she also wrote the magazine article, `Surf Girls of Maui,' on which the film, Blue Crush was based).While Charlie Kaufman (the screenwriter for Being John Malkovich) struggles with the increasingly impossible task of finishing a script about weirdos and orchids, his brother, Donald, decides to take up screenwriting.  Donald isn't writing an adaptation, he's writing an original screenplay.  Charlie thinks he knows everything about writing, Donald goes to a screenwriting seminar and posts the teacher's `Ten Commandments of Screenwriting' above his laptop.  Charlie pecks away on some old manual typewriter.  We've seen it all before:  sibling rivalry, identical twins who are opposites, so on and so forth.  We think we know the ending, as long as Charlie is writing it.  Somehow, despite Charlie's quest for originality, nothing very original transpires.  Some folks, at this point in the movie, will understandably get bored to tears.  Charlie just gets more neurotic and self-absorbed.  In fact, the only thing he can write about is himself, so he writes himself into the orchid movie.I guess things pick up at the end.  Someone else has said the characters get `weird.'  While I disliked myself as I fell for the Hollywood-style manipulation that the ending appeared to be, still, I woke up and was squirming in my seat.  Charlie attends the writing seminar, and learns to do `research.'  Thus liberated from the plotless constraints of the work he's supposed to be adapting, Charlie can write a different kind of movie. Research, apparently, can lead anywhere.The thing is, I cared  a lot  about the various characters.  I liked John and Donald best, Susan and Charlie were rather boring and neurotic.  The contrast drove the movie.  Do we all want to be interesting creatures of Hollywood then?  Or are we just human beings, adapting to our own predictable life circumstances by preferring stories with oomph and characters with style?  Chris Cooper's performance as John LaRoche was something I'd never seen before on the screen.  That's always a reason to make a movie.  The character and the performance were original, the actors were in first place all along.  The screenplay ultimately served the studio, the actors, the cinematographer, the director and even the prop department extraordinarily wellbut, perhaps, screenwriters don't come out looking so heroic."
11,Adaptation.,8,4 December 2002,actors & director create startling and original film,"""Adaptation"" is an off-the-wall film with a startling second half. Overall, the film is darkly comic, but viewers get an unexpected dose of movie action and violence before everything is said and done.It's fair to say that there is a fair amount of violence in the film, and even when you know it's coming, you're still caught off guard.  Spike Jonze is merciless in this regard.  Some of the scenes are incredibly graphic, in fact.There is a certain adolescent male tone to the film (the violence + sexual fantasy + masturbation).  This is partially due to characterization and partially due to the director's own aesthetic and perspective.  It's not a bad thing, necessarily, either.  It just feels as if an unassuming (white male) kid who grew up thinking a lot about girls and watching movies where stuff blowed up made this film...  See it and you'll know what I'm saying.The script is crazy.  Absolutely zany.  Akin to ""Being John Malkovich"" really.  Fortunately, this well gives opportunity for Nic Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper to really be free with their art.Cage has a difficult role, portraying two very different identical twin brothers.  Cage is at the emotional core of the film.  If his performance doesn't resonate, the film doesn't work.  I thought Cage was excellent. And that the script really gives him some wonderful, challenging material to work with.  His first scene with Tilda Swinton (looking gorgeous!) is excellent.Meryl Streep...well, what can be said.  She's fantastic.  She exudes a tiredness and connectedness and hopelessness and sadness, evolving the character brilliantly over the course of the film.Similarly, Chris Cooper brings a humanity to the role of the Orchad Thief, really grounding the narrative and making it all believable.  Again, he's given a brilliant opening scene and he works wonders with it. Throughout, he is believably arrogant, lonely, vulnerable, and just plain real. Cooper's performance is as rich as any other I've seen this year; truly, truly sublime.""Adaptation"" is certainly not for everyone.  If you're looking for something starkly different and simmering with originality, give this film a try, though.  Amidst some cloying self-referential clap-trap, there are actually some really freshing film moments."
12,Adaptation.,,5 October 2003,"For me, it's uniqueness was both it's making and it's undoing","Following his success as screenwriter for 'Being John Malcovich', Charlie Kaufman is given the job of adapting Susan Orlean's book 'The Orchid Thief' which she expanded from a piece in The New Yorker that she wrote on the obsessive orchid hunter John Laroche. While Charlie struggles to adapt the book into a workable film, his twin brother, Donald, writes a successful script around serial killers. The more Charlie struggles to get a story from the book the more the stories and his life start to intertwine.I wanted to see this film because I had enjoyed BJM and was interested to see what Jonze did next. I came to it with a vague knowledge of the plot but nowhere near enough o have expectations. For the majority of the film, the different style and presentation kept me deeply interested. The way the different stories occurred in different times and places worked a lot better than I would have expected it to. The plot gets increasingly difficult to follow and you'll get as much as you want from it. For those just looking for a simple story then you'll have a nice neat resolution, if you want more then more is there for you as you try to work out what part of the film is real and what part isn't.I came away with mixed feelings. I felt that the ending was not as clever as it thought it was and didn't give a good ending for those who weren't happy to accept things at face value. I didn't feel let down I just felt that the last section of the film stepped down a gear rather than up. I know that this is the point that Jonze was making perhaps, by allowing Donald's derided ending come to live and be the replacement for Charlie's original aim. But it didn't totally do it for me. Up till this section I was hooked and felt that the various stories all worked to form a mix of drama and comedy. However the end does a disservice to it's characters.Cage shows that the recent cr*p he has been in doesn't mean he can't act (just that he doesn't). He really brings his two characters to life and plays them so well that it is easy to forget that it is the same person in both roles. Cooper is wonderful and deserved his Oscar for support. Streep, as much as I dislike her, was very good and brought that difficult character out  although I did feel she was the one most betrayed by the film's end.Overall this was an interesting film that worked in most areas. It's difference and it's inventiveness were such that I wanted to keep watching. However I, and I know others will disagree, felt that this uniqueness was not well served by the end of the film. I understand that it was not meant to exist in the same way as the majority of the film but I still felt that the ending didn't meet the standard set by the rest of the film."
13,Adaptation.,,20 October 2010,Cleverness without soul,"""In Modernism, reality used to validate media. In Postmodernism, media validates reality."" - Brad Holland In real life, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was commissioned to write a screenplay based on journalist Susan Orlean's ""The Orchid Thief"". This novel (and the 1994 New Yorker magazine article upon which it was based) told the story of an orchid thief called John Laroche, his arrest for poaching a rare orchid and the subsequent relationship he develops with Susan Orlean.Unable to adapt ""The Orchid Thief"", and struggling to compress the novel down to a filmable form, Kaufman eventually gave up and instead decided to write a script based on how much trouble he was having adapting the book. In the film based on this script, now titled ""Adaptation"" and directed by Spike Jonze, Larouch is played by Chris Cooper, Orlean is played by Meryl Streep, and actor Nicholas Cage plays a slightly more neurotic version of the neurotic Charlie Kaufman. Overcome by self-loathing and existential angst, Cage/Kaufman is not only constantly berating himself for being bald, fat, socially inept and incompetent, but constantly moaning about how difficult adapting Orlean's book is.Why is the book so difficult to adapt? Because, Cage/Kaufman says, ""it is real"". The book's dramatic arcs aren't resolved, there is no central theme and, like real life, its character's don't learn anything, grow or change. Yes, the novel contains sizable patches of poetic musing and beautiful existential ruminations, but while these are of high literary quality, Kaufman believes they cannot be translated to film.And so what Kaufman and his Nicholas Cage avatar decide they need is a central theme. A common thread to hold everything together. His answer: postmodern self-reference. In other words, the theme of the film is the act of writing the film.And that's where the title of the film comes in. ""Adaptation"" refers not only to the act of adapting a screenplay from a novel, but a sort of evolutionary adaptation where organisms, humans and artists constantly bend to survive. And so the film is one big Darwinian family tree, life adapting into article, article adapting into novel, novel adapting into screenplay, screenplay adapting into movie. And along this artistic evolutionary process there are external forces that mutate, for good and bad, the thread of the original idea.Because the adaptation of one ""story"" into a ""next"" is too smug and simplistic for Kaufman (his character states this himself in the film), he tries to envelope other characters into this theme. And so the entire cast of the film is adapting to their surroundings, switching jobs, turning their backs to previous lives, careers or roles and learning to restart and re-adapt to new situations. To emphasise this theme, Kaufman has one character listening to a tape of Darwin's ""On the Origins of Species"", the sequel to which (not mentioned in the film) was Darwin's ""Fertilisation of Orchids"", a book which explored the complex relationship between insects and plants and the way they slowly adapt to one another.Unexpectedly, Jonze keeps a tight reign on Kaufman's wild imagination. The film is zany, but because it is filmed in a rather low-key style, never degenerates into quirky surrealism and easy irony. Gradually, however, we become aware that the scenes between Cooper and Streep are easily the movie's most engaging and insightful, and the observations attributed to or taken from Orlean's book are more provocative than any of the meta-ironic musings generated by Kaufman. Elsewhere Jonze provides the audience with glimpses of Orlean's book (via narration) as Cage obsessively reads through it, and even has Kaufman's character commenting on how brilliant Orlean's writing is. The effect is such that the film celebrates the book, whilst admitting that nothing it does can convey or compete with its insights. This results in a rather schizoid film, half of the film great, possessing the insights of a talented writer and journalist, the other half drowned in Kaufman's postmodern meta-gymnastics and gloomy self-loathing. In other words, Orlean is sensitive and perceptive about human behaviour, whilst Kaufman is mockingly irreverent.How to end such a schizoid film? Kaufman, in real life, has no idea. And so he has his Cage avatar wrestle with this problem and then seek advice from a screen writing expert. The eventual solution: Kaufman invents a twin brother named Donald who's identical to him physically but 100% his opposite intellectually. Easygoing, unpretentious and entirely void of originality, Donald decides he wants to be a screenwriter too and the lion's share of the film's comedy arises from Cage's derision of his brother's ideas. And so Donald quickly becomes the kind of easy target the director Robert Altman served up at the end of ""The Player"". Kaufman moulds him into a symbol for everything derivative and dumb about mainstream filmmaking  a love for serial killers, multiple personality plot lines, sex, gunfights, murder, drugs, car chases etc  but his real function is to inject nihilism into the actual form of the film. Donald, and his cosmically random death, is the catalyst which terminates the entire story, the film self-consciously using a ""cop out"" ending in which Orlean and Cooper become villains who kill everyone and dramatically end the narrative.This last act of the film thus serves three functions: it's a dumb and derivative parody which hypocritically mocks that which it embraces, it's a self-referential deus ex machina used to arbitrarily end the film, and, more importantly, it's an admittance that Orlean's book is so ""real"" and ""true"" that it can not ""begin"" on film let alone ""end"", which is itself a sort of artistic defeatism.7.9/10  Excellent at times, but also insufferably postmodern, vapid, and with little understanding of real artists, real people and the artistic process itself. Worth one viewing."
14,Adaptation.,,9 January 2003,"From portals to orchids, Jonze and Kauffman strike again","Three years after director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kauffman's brilliantly offbeat masterpiece Being John Malkovich, comes their latest stream of conscious head trip. Yes folks, this one stars Nicholas Cage...and, Nicholas Cage.The film starts off appropriately enough inside Being John Malkovich(or more precisely on the set of Being John Malkovich when Malkovich is inside his own head) But this is no sequel...no no, much more than that. We soon go back to the beginning. Not the beginning of the movie, but to the beginning of it all. To the dawn of the universe, a zero in the fabric of time itself hurling toward the deep chasm of entropy. From the primitive scribblings of early man to the manic late night scribblings of the neurotic Charlie Kauffman(played by Cage)What we have here is a film about orchid thieves, high society New York socialites, screenwriters, identical twins, crocodiles, narcotic rings, and internet porn...err, more aptly put: a movie about a guy writing a movie about a book inside of another movie. Oh yeah, and it's based on a true story. Sound confusing?Adaptation is the screen treatment of the best selling non fiction book The Orchid Thief. Only thing is the main character in the film is doing the adapting, and writing himself into script. In the film we go from early primordial man to Being John Malkovich's floor seven and a half...and somehow it all makes sense.Is this an incoherent parable on the parasitic relationship between writers and their subjects? The evolution from single cell organisms to paleolithic glee? Or a look at how everything seems to have a purpose in life? Somehow between the obscure Hollywood industry injokes, Silence of the Lambs references, and celebrity Boggle tournaments I missed something.
Unfortunately by the third act(when the movie goes from non fiction to fiction) Adaptation unravels and ends up gravely falling apart. But perhaps that is the point. A film about a real life struggle to adapt a book that doesnt have much suspense in it, and the peril of trying to work some fictional thriller plotlines in at the last minute. Either way, hats off to Jonze and Kauffman for once again bringing us an audaciously unconventional idea and tearing down the box. All this from the adaptive skills of an orchid.~.c//0ry"
15,Adaptation.,1,20 April 2010,"Self-Referential, Narcissistic, Crap = High Art = Adaptation","After watching this movie, what feels like 100 times, I regretfully have to say: I have nothing to say. It's unfortunate for me to admit, but nothing in this movie really sticks out as critique worthy. Some might want me to point out the ""confusing"" plot; however, I didn't find it confusing at all. I've seen more plot twists in a half-hour television show. I mean, sure the whole idea of taking a writer who is having writer's block write a script about himself writing a script about himself writing a script might confuse some people, I never got lost in the multiple layers of ""reality"".The characters in this, while based (somewhat) on real life, were entertaining; I feel like the story hinged too much on the people involved and not enough on what was happening. Aside from the masturbation, drugs, and sex, these characters are little more than cardboard cut outs of stereotypical characters we see in everything else! (exception: John Laroche). Character 1) Charlie Kaufman = Self-loathing screenwriter with writer's block commissioned to write a script over a book that doesn't have a story. ENTER Character 2) Donald Kaufman = The Outgoing, reckless, bum TWIN BROTHER of Charlie. (While I can appreciate the fact that Donald isn't real, and was fabricated by the ""REAL"" Charlie Kaufman to help move the plot along in HIS script, it's sloppy and not creative in the least).ENTER Character 3) Susan Orlean = Dissatisfied wife, writer, pulled into the life of a much more interesting person - thus falling in love with...Character 4) John Laroche = ""...tall guy, skinny as a stick, pale eyes, slouch-shouldered, sharply handsome, despite the fact he's missing all his front teeth."" - the Only interesting and ""original"" character based on a REAL person.I mean really, Characters 1-3 can be swapped out with any character from any other bland Comedy-Drama film. At first viewing, yes I loved the movie, but after watching it again... and again... and again... I found that while some might find the movie as very creative, I found it extremely pretentious in the fact that it builds itself up on the basis of writing a self-referential script about a self-referential script. Narcissistic? Maybe. Annoying? With out a doubt.Add to that, the extremely slow pace of this movie and you have Adaptation. By the middle of the movie, you feel worn out and sick of seeing Nicholas Cage's face, this being said by a fan of Nick Cage. But seriously, the movie couldn't move any slower, taking time to point out all the things that AREN'T happening. BUT THEN, we get to the end where all of the sudden Susan and John are doing drugs and having sex and trying to kill Charlie, and shoot Don, and wreck the car into a park ranger, flinging Don out killing him, Prompting Charlie to sing ""Happy Together"", ending with Charlie writing a script about himself trying to write the script!In the end, we get what is called by many-a-film-critic as ""High Art"" and ""Clever"". While all I saw was a writer's attempt at writing a script over a movie, but FAILING and writing about himself instead. Sorry folks, but I genuinely hated this movie. And would strongly recommend everyone who hasn't seen it to go buy/rent ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" instead (ESotSM, being equally pretentious and depressing, but having Jim Carry who somehow makes you laugh WHILE you cry).In a summary, I thought the movie was crap."
16,Adaptation.,3,23 February 2003,The Screenwriter Has No Clothes,"Oy. Where to begin?Some stray thoughts jumbled in my head:self-indulgent, not intelligent enough to support the degree to which it is pretentious, tedious, unfunny, solipsistic (and yes, I know that's part of the ""joke"" but it's not funny, just dull), empty-headed, gimmicky, Nicholas Cage?????, ""insider""-y, lazy.  In many ways, I think ""Adaptation"" feels like a bad ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch stretched to 2 hours.
I understand the inside jokes, the ironic commentary on the Industry, the satire, the sarcasm, etc etc etc. I understand which parts of the film must be fantasy, which parts may be fantasy, etc etc.  But there was just nothing there I cared about and I don't think any statement on the film business or writing being made had any substance to it.  The whole thing felt thin and tired.  It's not deep enough to be taken seriously, not over-the-top enough to be considered zany fun and doesn't have the emotional power to touch our souls. It doesn't even mix these elements.  It's like a big cold pile of half-eaten mashed potatoes sitting on a dirty plate.I must admit I admire Charlie Kaufman for having the chutzpah to present this script in lieu of the project he was hired to write and in getting a producer to pay him for it.  But the entire premise seems little more than a schoolboyish trick of trying to get away with failing to write a paper by writing a paper about why you couldn't do the assigned paper -- and hoping it will prove a sufficently amusing ruse to charm your teacher into not failing you. Mr. Kaufman seems to be trying to build a career on cute gimmicks.  Sadly, this being Hollywood --- and America --- he will probably get away with it for years to come.  Both with""Being John Malkovich"" and with ""Adaptation"" the audiences seem to spend so much time being impressed by a mildly interesting premise that they don't bother to worry -- or even think -- about whether it's a premise that supports (or warrants) an entire feature film.  The only real joke here is one that can only be enjoyed by Mr. Kaufman, who's gotten an Academy Award nomination for what should probably have been treated as a breach of contract. The uselessness of the film notwithstanding, Chris Cooper gives a great performance and Meryl Steep does a very good job.  Nicholas Cage overplays both of his parts and, frankly, creates a character that I think is completely unsympathetic (in other words, he does his usual work.)  Does anyone really care by the end what happens to him or to his brother?  In the last 15 minutes of the movie, my thinking was, ""I think what should happen next is whatever will get this movie ended the quickest.""   
In terms of awards:  Best Scam. (And I admit to being frustrated by the fact that Mr. Kaufman would probably be happy with that.)"
17,Adaptation.,1,3 June 2003,Oops! Be careful. Don't step in the art!,"So in this movie, Adaptation, we learn that it's all artistic to be self-referential and stuff like that.  There is that screenwriter, Charlie, who's trying to adapt a novel written by some lady whose photograph he likes to masturbate to, but he really doesn't spend too much time talking about her novel at all, and that's really bold, creative and visionary.  I wish I could be creative, but I don't think my brain works that way.  Charlie's brain comes from a brain factory.I remember when I was in grade school, I had to do this report on Howard Hughes, but instead of writing about Howard Hughes, I wrote down on a piece of paper about how I went to the library and couldn't find anything about Howard Hughes, and my teacher gave me an F, which shows how stupid she is. I was self-referential and artistic, and I was all, you know, exploring and chronicling the creative process of writing a paper about Howard Hughes, and that unimaginative brute stunted my creativity by giving me an F.  She said I didn't do the assignment.  I'm glad that the production company that hired Charlie to adapt that lady's book didn't stunt his growth just because he didn't do his assignment.  In fact, if I were that lady who wrote the book, instead of seeing a movie about my book, I think I'd much rather see a movie about some bald, fat loser whacking-off to my picture, and then portraying me as a murderous crack whore.  That would be art.You can tell that Charlie's a true art guy, because all of them art guys use what they call literary devices.  Like that time where Charlie employed that literary device called irony.  Remember that?  It was awesome.  In the movie, Charlie Kaufman has a split personality.  His alter ego is his twin brother, Andy Kaufman, who wrestles women and writes a screenplay, The Three, about some guy who has three distinct personalities.  While Charlie is self-indulgently poking fun at formulaic thrillers like The Three, it's all *ironic* and stuff that audience members, deep down, are thinking, ""Wow, I really wish I were watching The Three instead of this steaming pile of art.""Oh yeah!  And then there's that one part where Kaufman doesn't have nearly the talent, ability or craftsmanship to adapt that lady's book so he slaps that fake ending on it. (And this is the genius part!)  He slaps that fake ending on it - all the while pretending to lampoon the fabled vulgar, formulaic Hollywood ending - but what he's really doing is covering up for the fact that he doesn't possess the skill to pull off the adaptation. Bravo, Charles!  Bravo!  So now all the elitist critics can watch this incoherent mess of a movie, fling four stars at it, smugly chuckle at the great unwashed movie going masses, and congratulate themselves at being so incredibly insightful and sophisticated as to decipher the subtle subtext.In conclusion, let me paraphrase Charlie Kaufman himself:  Adaptation is self-indulgent.  It's narcissistic.  It's solipsistic.  It's pathetic. Kaufman is pathetic.  He's fat and pathetic.  The reason this screenplay is self-referential is that he was too timid to speak to the woman who wrote the book.  Because he's pathetic.  Because he has no idea how to write. Because he can't make flowers fascinating.  Because he sucks."
18,Adaptation.,1,8 August 2004,Absolutley... BORING,"I'm sorry, but I have tried to watch this film twice. Both times I just wanted to quit with the movie. I read the back of the cover and all it says is ""GREAT PERFORMANCES!"". Etc, etc, etc. As much as I love Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper, their performances in the film, I have to say were pretty average. Not their best attempts. The only one that I'd have to say was the best was by Nicolas. He seemed like he was very into his character. But the movie, despite being only 2 hours, felt like it was 3. I just couldn't believe that anyone else couldn't find this movie to be boring. How it could be on the top 250. It's trying to be another ""American Beauty"", and it failed. Sorry to those who enjoyed the film, but I have to say it was horrible.1/10"
19,Adaptation.,1,1 March 2003,Desperately disappointing,"I went to see Adaptation with high hopes. They were all dashed. About 40 minutes in, the Charlie Kaufman character describes his screenplay as self-indulgent, narcissistic, solipsistic and pathetic, which sums up my feelings about the film pretty neatly.But although the film itself is bad enough, the ending is worse. The only worthwhile moral I could draw from this vastly over-blown effort (it lasts almost two hours) is Don't Ride in a Car Without Wearing a Seatbelt. As a road safety film, it's first rate. Otherwise, it's well worth steering clear off."
20,Adaptation.,,20 January 2003,Abject Folding,"Spoilers herein.I am writing a book about `folding' in film. That's a term I have coined to describe all the parallel levels that have become part of the film vocabulary, among them self-reference, reflection, self-aware irony and timeshifting. I love these films. They are always about ideas and many are incredibly sophisticated in concept, even though the story (an incidental component in such projects) may be uninteresting. There are an amazing number of films with some sort of folding -- in my nearly 1,000 IMDB comments, I have found about a third that use these tricks.The most obvious are films that are about their own making, like `The Muppet Movie,' `Beyond the Clouds,' and `The Player.' But here we have something new, I think. In this case, the folding is not a technique in the film, it is the star of the film. Several types of folding are used here: time overlaps, self-reference, ironic distance, nested narratives (a metamovie about a movie about a book about a magazine article about a botanical scam) where the nesting is scrambled. Along the way, we have not only a surrogate for the writer (and the writer he is writing about) but a imaginary twin who comments on the writing process.I really enjoyed this as an intellectual exercise; the clever barrage of tricks was impressive. But it is an elaborate but empty shell. Nic Cage has always been an actor that is incapable of spanning levels (like Penn or Depp or Brando or quite a few of our actresses today). Streep is a master at this sort of thing, in fact set the gold standard for folded acting with `The French Lieutenant's Woman.' But she is asked to be as flat as Cage is. Cooper is fantastic of course, but is only a fantastic cartoon.
I found it unsatisfying when elevated to the level of Tarantino-like self-referential humor, all except for one bit: the folding in of the masturbatory fantasies at the same level as everything else. Just think about this; there's a powerful force acting both ways between the creator and the created, between the writer and character. Here at the same level is the VERY SAME equivalence with fantastic sexual compliance. That one part with the redheaded waitress, Alice, behind the orchid show was shocking -- shocking because of this equivalence. Not even Lynch does this.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."
21,Adaptation.,1,1 July 2012,"Rot, posing as depth","Movies that jump around in time seem automatically to be interesting or deep or complex or some such rot to many people. Cage plays a loser. Deeper thinkers will explain that he's interestingly depressed, socially inept, whatever...he's a dip. Notwithstanding that his character supposedly wrote a good screen-play, he becomes immediately tiresome. Not funny, not pitiable, not dramatic...boring. The movie is dull, start to finish, being so by violating the admonitions of a screen-writer ""consultant"" who, for some reason, appears in the movie.If you must see this junk piece, borrow it from the library or watch it on Netflix. Even for ""free"" you will have wasted nearly two hours of your life. The cover on the DVD speaks of hilarious comedy and ""something good"" drama. There was none of either, a waste of Streep,and far too much of Cage."
22,Adaptation.,,20 May 2003,Write what you know is true - Hollywood always wins,"*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*Protagonist. Conflict. (Wedge in a love story). Character arc. Climax! Denouement. Three acts. End with a whopper and you got them. You can fight it but there's only one way to write a screenplay. Well, one way to write a screenplay that will sell, sell, and sell! Hollywood wins every time.""Adaptation"" is about admitting defeat and still winning.  Kaufman is right. There is no way to make a movie about a guy who steals flowers. But then again, there is a way. I know because I just watched it. It was called ""Adaptation"". Throw in some flower drugs, a car crash...ooohh, car crashes are cool...and sex. Don't forget about sex. Never forget about sex. When people are watching a movie, they are not having sex. But it's always good to remind the audience about the good times. Wrap it all up with some self loathing and a flower thief and you've got a Green Light on that picture!So the struggle to stay true to the book/yourself/art collides head on with the reality of movie making.  What does the audience want to see? What's hot this week? Who knows? How about a movie about a writer who can't write? Brilliant! Wedge a love story in and it can't lose. If you like flicks about Hollywood and the creative process, you'll like this movie. Oh, and Kaufman's agent, (Ron Livingston), cracked me up. He knew the perfect icebreaking line to ease the tension."
23,Adaptation.,1,29 January 2003,An orgy of stereotypes and visual banality,"I have never thought that Spike Jonze had talent, and ""Adaptation"" confirmed my opinion about it: a few pyrotechnic music video techniques cannot compensate the enormous deficits of a story about ""nothing interesting"" (a dorky screenwriter who simply doesn't know how to write), that doesn't have a natural end.  Cage is fun, even if a dork is always fun, but Jonze ruins it all with bad shots and, dulcis in fundo, an ""I-love-you-I-love-you-too-plus-flowers-growing"" end. In my opinion, the worst movie of the year after ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""."
24,Adaptation.,1,17 March 2007,Pretentious .,"I know that many people liked this movie ,but I hated it . Directed by Spike Jonze ,who also directed ""Being John Malkovich "" and written by Charlie Kauffman (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ) received a lot of praise form the critics ,but personally I found it annoying ,narcicist and self referential that it fails in all what it pretend to be . Basically the trick of the movie are the parallels with the reality and the combination of different genres , comedy ,drama and thriller . Some people said that the movie big merit it is the incredibly originality of it (actually at the end it is incredibly predictable ),but actually it looks more like a complete mess where not even the director knew what they were doing . The style of the movie it's horrible ,the narration it's completely chaotic . When it tries to be comedy ,it's not funny ,and the combination of genres don't go very well together . The only good point of the movie were the performances ,specially Cage , even when his character it's incredibly annoying and poorly conceived . This movie it's a mess .Probably you could have a different opinion than mine ,but I just can't stand this movie ."
25,Adaptation.,1,30 May 2003,Good Grief!,"Go back, it's a trap!   First off, this is somehow classified as a comedy. Pardon me.  Not only was it a lame ""adaptation"" of what might have been a movie, but it's certainly NOT a comedy.   Good Grief!This is the first time I tried to enter a negative number for a rating.  I find that IMDB.com won't accept that.  Guess I'll elevate it to a ""1"".Can't say I'm a fan of Nicolas Cage, but I certainly am a fan of Meryl Streep!  She needs to check with her agent after this one.  What the heck is she doing in here?  Talk about a waste of talent!  Good Grief.If you already blew your $5. on renting this movie, and you're wading thru the everglades with this impressive cast, thinking that most critics, including Roger Ebert, have blessed this effort, DON'T expect things to pick up.....they indeed can get worse.This is a junior-high written venture about a screenwriter whose dog ate his script, and had to dream up something on the way to school.  Good Grief. Negative 10!"
26,Adaptation.,9,23 May 2003,Mixed Feelings,"I will say this:  If negative critical review originally put you off seeing ""Adaptation."", don't let it stop you now; rent it and watch it.But at the same time don't get the idea I'm raving about it.  I do resent that a local reviewer (Wilonsky in Dallas) put me off seeing this movie. I've just seen it on VHS and am glad I did.  But I do also have mixed feelings.It's certainly ballsy of these folks to ""foist"" the premise upon us.  I'm not mindlessly taken in by swank, self-referential tap-dances with wolves. But I do expect more.  And ""Adaptation."" does deliver something--maybe not enough to make it a fantastic movie, but it's no slouch, either.  There was enough solid narrative content so we can't accuse Kaufman of just jerking off at our expense.  I thought the acting was wonderful.  I was very taken in by Cage creating two very distinct personas.  I thought Streep was fantastic, very much enjoyed (of course) Cooper, and there were *no* bit parts in this movie.  Everyone was dynamite.I'm glad that some central themes were left unscripted.  The moral is not *only* the one explicitly given by the ""happy"" brother out in the swamp. It's also implied in the unpleasant-to-watch-but-entirely-necessary writhings of the ""unhappy"" brother in the preceding action.  *That* is a very saving grace of the script, as well as of it's execution.Weak stuff?  In the end, you have to ask whether you can *feel* the hero's redemption in your gut, and I find this movie somewhat wanting on that point.  Somehow, the ball gets dropped.  But, as I sit here, I have to say I feel a sense of wondering about the fate of Kaufman's character, the way Fellini and his fans sort of wonder how ol' Cabiria is getting on.  That's got to be some kind of tribute....Speaking of which:  I think comparing this movie to 8-1/2; especially suggestions that 8-1/2 sort of obviates ""Adaptation."" is rather unfair. Just because someone else sort of played this idea in the past doesn't mean a new treatment of the concept is dead in the water.  There is enough freshness here--new ideas on how to implement the premise--to warrant treating it on its own merits and weaknesses.  Stop beating ""Adaptation."" with the ""8-1/2"" stick already!But, uh, if you *liked* ""Adaptation."" and _haven't_ seen 8-1/2, you do sound like a good candidate to watch and fully enjoy 8-1/2, so get on the stick, bubbalah!I guess in the end I have to join the woefully self-deceived crowd and confess that, on the whole, I liked this movie.  It was well worth the time spent watching it."
27,Adaptation.,3,13 February 2003,This movie is bad.  Sorry.,"I saw 'Adaptation' last night and was very disappointed. The problem wasn't in the performances, which I thought wereexcellent, nor Spike Jonze's direction, but rather with Kaufman'sscreenplay.  Like a bad stand-up comic who has to alert theaudience whenever there's a punchline, Kaufman seems to feelthe need to ask ""Get It!?"" once his ideas start to take form.  ""Wait,you see, the film winds up having a 'Hollywood' ending eventhough it's the bane of the writer's existence, meanwhilecommenting on the state of the film industry and artistic integrity. Get it!?""  The idea of making a movie about making the movie thatcatches up with itself mid-way through isn't even that original. Geez, the did that in 'Spaceballs.'  And regarding the film'spseudo-ironic ending, Altman already worked that idea (to a muchbetter effect) in 'The Player.'  I think Kaufman is talented and iscapable of really original things, but unfortunately, 'Adaptation' isn'tit."
28,Adaptation.,10,12 October 2017,Genius,"The first time I watched this movie, I thought ""this is either pretentious garbage or pure genius"". After letting it sink in for a few days, I thought about it and certain pieces started fitting together. I decided to give it a second watch, and afterwards I was like ""oh of course, its genius"".I think a lot of people who criticize this film don't understand what the film is going for. I'll try not to spoil anything, but I left a disclaimer since I'll be roughly outlining the plot. A common criticism I see is that the film tries to reject the Hollywood screen writing clichés but chickens out at the end for a dumb action-packed climax. Here's the thing: The film uses the 3-act structure in an ironic way. The film is about the writing of the film. Early on in the film, Charlie Kaufman (the character, not the real person) is trying to stay faithful to the source material he's given to adapt. The source material is The Orchid Thief, a nonlinear book that doesn't really follow a typical 3-act structure. When he experiences writer's block, he asks his twin brother, who went to a screen writing seminar, for help. He even goes to the screen writing seminar himself. Every piece of advice he gets makes the script more formulated, and thus so does the film. It should be fairly obvious once we see Susan Orlean (the character, not the real person) snorting plant drugs and fornicating with John Laroche (the character) that fiction has taken over. That's also why Charlie and Donald follow her to Florida, and crazy stuff involving guns and an alligator ensues. The film's ending works on multiple levels. It can be enjoyed by the average moviegoer as a dumb fun climax but more discerning viewers will be in on the joke.One thing I want to bring up before I wrap up is Nicolas Cage's performance as the fictional Charlie Kaufman. At first I thought ""oh come on, there's no way anyone is that insecure and submissive"" but then I saw videos of interviews with the real Charlie Kaufman and was like ""oh wow, Nick Cage nailed it"". Its not an exact recreation, but it definitely works as a fictional portrayal.There's more details I'll leave for you to discover on your own. All you have to know is this is a very clever film and serves as a great satire of Hollywood tropes. Personally, I think this movie is perfect, and there's nothing I would change that I could imagine making the film objectively better. Charlie Kaufman is one of the most fascinating screenwriters working in Hollywood today and I'd say all of his films are worth a watch!"
29,Adaptation.,8,16 June 2017,"Subverting the rules for creating a roadmap, is often the very path of affirmation of such rules. For in the end everything is just a process of adaptation.","The kaleidoscope of metalanguage presented in the film, are presented and used with mastery, either at the beginning of ""Adaptation"" which is linked to the term ""Being John Malkovich"", both directed by the distinguished Spike Jonze. Still on metalanguage, which is about an adaptation of a book to a cinematographic script, which is created simultaneously with the film itself, ie a film about itself, as a joyfully self-referential exercise of self-deconstruction. But it is also, more profoundly, a film about its own non-existence - a narrative that confronts both the impossibility and the desperate need to tell stories provokes our expectations of coherence, plausibility and fidelity to the reality lived.There are variety of games presented in the film are dominated by the restlessness of knowing what is real what imaginary, what in fact thinks Charlie Kaufman, movie roter and what in fact thinks or thought Susan Orlean, when writing the book ""The Orchid Thief ""that inspired the film. What script rules are actually followed, ignored, and subverted? And that in the film are presented and worked through the figure of the writing twins Charlie Kaufman / Donald Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) and scriptwriter Robert McKee (Brian Cox).So well adapted to this story are the actors, who in addition to acting are guides who invite us and lead us to organize the fragmentary data of the film. If in the figure of the twins writers we have two sides of the same man, and that in ""Adaptation"" is referenced like the opposites of the same figure of a policeman and a bandit, where both are complementary. If the script uses these two men to present the diversity of the same man, we have in Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) the perfect adaptation of the divergences that fit in a single person, of how human and fragile and volatile and how the process Of adaptation of a person is not necessarily followed by completely philosophical or psychological questions, are in the measure, impulses of an immediate action. The character Susan surprises with her abrupt change in the end and unpredictability of her attitudes, though consistent, without script or construction failures.The use of the pace in ""Adaptation"" is undoubtedly an important and necessary point to tell this story, Jonze with his experience in clips and series for MTV, was able to absorb the freshness of a stormy pace that assists in the complexity of moments lived by Charlie and Susan or in moments of lull and mockery of Donald's life as well as in the great final Match Point, a frenetic, accelerated jab of actions and images, but which unfortunately comes out too much, unnecessary, in trying to present solutions that lead to an outcome.At first, Charlie's overly self-conscious and pseudo-intellectual crises are fun as we recognize the same tendencies in ourselves. So we also feel his yearning when he is so touched by a book that it looks like it could be the catalyst to kick him out of his narcissistic lifestyle. That is, until Kaufman reveals his great epiphany - that even after enlightenment, life is still cheap and dirty. What is not true or absolute lie, but turn into two hours of a film, where director and screenwriter apparently dialogues with each other and the public is the passive stance to accompany their discussions."
30,Adaptation.,8,7 March 2015,"Very Bizarre and Risky Film for Everyone Involved,","Adaptation is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. This film is very unusual, the way it is laid out, the way we are introduced to and follow the main characters and even the reason it got made is weird (look it up on trivia). Charlie Kaufman was putting his entire career at risk when he wrote this script, as he was suppose to adapt a book in to a movie, but was struggling so much that he instead decided to write a script about him struggling to adapt a book in to a movie, and I think that is much better than how an actual Orchid Thief film would have turned out.I would like to have seen more development for Charlie Kaufman, the character, as we learn little about his personal life beyond his twin brother. I felt it would have been interesting if Kaufman added in a back story for this exaggerated version of himself, and it would have made the character more engaging. Nicolas Cage delivers one of the finest performances of his career, it says in the trivia that he ignored all his acting instincts and did exactly as director Spike Jonze told him to, and this can be seen throughout the entire movie. There is always something very safe about Cage's acting in the majority of his performances, but he is over the top and very sincere in both of his roles in this. He is also joined by a stellar supporting cast, most notably Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper, who have stellar chemistry together. It is a zany film and there is no chance you will ever find another film quite like it. Mind boggling, dramatic and even at times quite funny, I would recommend Adaptation to anyone looking for a good drama. A stressed screenwriter finds an unusual way to tackle writers block while attempting to turn a non-fiction book in to a film script. Best Performance: Nicolas Cage"
31,Adaptation.,8,18 July 2014,"Solid, though definitely ""Screenwriter's Interest"" material. Nick-o-meter 7/10","This one was introduced to me through numerous clips which were shown to a screen writing class I took in college, and the whole movie is (or should be) of interest to anyone interested in screen writing, or even more generally ""what makes a good story?"", ""how are stories written?"" (at least as far as Kaufman is concerned). One of the most entertaining parts of the film is how it propounds lots of rules for writing good movies and then breaks every single one of them (pay attention to the opening dialogue between Cage and Swinton). In the end, it's a philosophical piece, not so much giving answers as challenging the viewer to think for himself. A solid."
32,Adaptation.,10,6 August 2010,"The redeemable, comic loser in all of us...","Charlie Kaufman, played by Nicolas Cage, is the protagonist of this off- the-wall film. He is also, of course, the writer of the screenplay. This odd element is characteristic of the boundary-breaking mission of this film. Except one thinks of a mission as being direct and seriously undertaken with an obvious objective. Adaptation. is like Darwinian evolution itself - slow-paced and digressive, even rather confused, but galumphing towards a goal nonetheless.What that goal is, however, is not so clear. Kaufman and Jonze are innovative hand elliptical. Their message is circular, the temporal landscape ranges over the dramatic content of a decade, and the plot is strewn about with the gratuitous elements of ol' familiar Hollywood. Yet everything - everything! - is discussed endogenously - in the movie itself - in one way or another. Both Kaufman and his twin brother (also Cage - in a masterful comic performance) are writing film scripts, Kaufman's actually being the one for the film itself. And it is all utterly playful, ridiculous, and hilarious. Even if it can be, at times, painfully awkward and sincerely heart-felt.The great novelty of the film is its voice-over narration. It begins during the credits - flashing white lettering at the bottom of a sparse, black screen. It is the bewildered, self-deprecating, and insecure voice of the highly pathetic Kaufman. It is unmistakably the rambling of a rational loser - life mired in self-perceived mediocrity, a rut, single and bored, but with hopes for improvement - ""maybe I could learn Russian...I need a girl..."". This will resonate with most everyone who has ever procrastinated, been down, or hoped for self-improvement. It will probably make you feel self-conscious, even uncomfortable, but who can say that is a bad thing?"
33,Adaptation.,10,6 February 2003,evolution of a writer,"If Charlie Kaufman wins an Oscar for this brilliant screenplay, it will be interesting to see if Nicolas Cage impersonates him in accepting it.  This movie is about many things, but mostly about the lonely life of a writer and the pressures of success that would lead a creative individual into creating alter egos within alter egos.  And equating the creative process with the whole of creation, not a trivial theme and one which Kaufman explores both seriously and hilariously.  The very nature of reality is bent, or I should say refracted, in the way Kaufman plays so loose with the real lives of Orlean and Larouche, ultimately adapting them to fit his, or Hollywood's, idea of what a modern movie should be.  How he submits to the scriptwriting guru to arrive at that great god Structure, which allows him both to create a tidy resolution and lampoon all such artificial, melodramatic devices used by the majority of Hollywood films.Nicolas Cage has been in many outstanding comedies in the last 20 years, but this, to me, is the 3rd in a great trilogy, completing ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" which is not to say they have a lot in common thematically, but just great performances in great films.(Come to think of it, ""Adaptation"" may be closer to ""Wild at Heart"" as a comedy, especially when I think of the very real violence that punctuates both of them.)"
34,Adaptation.,10,31 January 2003,Kaufman sets you up and then delivers the perfect knockout punch.,"Kaufman's first two acts wind you through an Allenesque venture about the fallibilities of human nature, the self doubts of the talented, and the absurdities of modern society.  He does it well, it's funny, and the viewer accepts it as the definition of the movie.  What you don't see is Kaufman's preparation for the final act explosion.   You'll realize you've been duped, but you won't be disappointed!Cage is wonderful as the twin Kaufman brothers.  It takes a while to get over Nicholas Cage doing Woody Allen, but after a few minutes you'll think he was born for the role (roles).  Streep is never disappointing and ""Adaptation"" provides her with an opportunity to strut her stuff!  Chris Cooper delivers another solid performance and makes you wonder if he wears a bridge in real life.  The viewers that don't appreciate Kaufman's high jinks (some people just don't get it) will still walk away from this movie raving about the performances of an awesome cast.""Adaptation"" delivers a multi-layer presentation of a multi-faceted story with multiple dimensions of intrigue.  Why don't they make more movies like this?"
35,Adaptation.,,6 July 2003,Ask your twin brother how he would review this film...,"This is a film that I find difficult to comment on, as there is almost no frame of reference with any other film or genre.You don't need to know anything about the plot, just sit back and let it happen to you.  Hey, a little trust for the team that brought you Being John Malkovich, OK?  Forget about whether you like Nicholas Cage, Meryl Streep or orchids; it doesn't matter.I laughed hard in a few spots, though I didn't laugh a lot. The funniest bits were all the conversations between the ""brothers,"" and also when Charlie is talking to himself.  For example: Charlie: ""Ourobouros.  It's a snake eating its tail.""  Donald:  ""No I don't think that's it.  But listen...""You can see Charlie's anguish and self-loathing in his face and body.
Adaptation comments upon the creative process, ""great art"" versus ""Hollywood crap,"" loneliness, loss and yearning, without ever seeming highbrow, mannered or false.Chris Cooper's orchid thief could be a guy you know, and you'd be better for knowing him.  Cooper acted his ass off and got the Oscar, the least you could do is watch this film without preconceptions, and without asking ""what's it about?""I will anxiously await Spike Jonze's next project.  He has got to be the most highly original director in the world today.  It's hard to complain about the lack of quality in media (reality shows, etc.) when Spike Jonze movies are huge hits that win Oscars and feature huge talents.Did I like ""Adaptation"" as much or more than ""...Malkovich""?  No. The latter film appeals too directly to my aesthetic nerve centre.  Would I watch it again?  Maybe.  Some of the emotions were so palpable that it was rough going and therefore not as much of a fun, carefree ride as ""...Malkovich.""  But I'm extremely impressed at the way Jonze merges true pathos with humor and excessive oddness and makes it all work."
36,Adaptation.,1,25 July 2003,bleah!,"I found this movie thoroughly boring and depressing. I didn't find it interesting or clever at all despite the many tricks designed to seem appealing - ie. voice over, merging of the storyline with the screenwriter's life, and Cage playing two characters often in the same screen. I'm surprised that Meryl Streep and Nicolas Cage agreed to do this one! It doesn't seem to be good move for their careers in my opinion. Some of the characters actions are inexplicably out of character, and yet there is still not enough change to make them very interesting. There is very little plot and the protagonist has no redeeming characteristics."
37,Adaptation.,1,28 June 2003,What a Stinker!,"I don't know why human beings tend to embrace the talented even when they create a movie which is self-indulgent and dull.  Take the movie Adaptation. Or if you are smart leave it.  If this movie had been written by Susan Who, was directed by Joe Jonze, and stared Nick Nobody, it would have been reviewed for what it was.  It was self-indulgent drivel.I was never once engaged in this movie, I didn't care what happened to the characters and I should have turned it off after 20 minutes.  I didn't.  I watched the entire movie.In my humble opinion just don't.  You won't have missed a thing."
38,Adaptation.,9,9 April 2006,A beautiful but unfilmable idea made into film,"Some plot elements revealed ! Please see the film before finishing !This film explores the bipolar (manic depressive) nature of the creative process in the film industry in a film of two halves.. Charlie Kaufmann is a critically successful screenwriter (Being John Malkovich) who has found a beautiful and gentle story which he has been asked to create a screen play. The film shows his ideas developing illustrated by himself and his brother's bipolar characters, and a series of credible characters involved with developing the beautiful flower concept from origin to screen. Charles reaches a crisis when he realises this story is essentially unfilmable, and so he asks his brother, his agent and a writing guru for help. We see how Charles solves his problem in the 2nd half of the film when the plot develops several new themes, such as a passionate love affair, drug conspiracies, and a violent and thrilling climactic chase scene in the Florida swamps. A view of the biographies of the director and screen writers is very instructive. This film is very clever and extremely well made but probably will miss the general public."
39,Adaptation.,1,6 June 2003,"If you want this kind of thing, do it yourself","""Being John Malkovich"" gave me the impression its ideal form was a short story. Whether or not I'm right about that, Charlie Kaufman's screenplay, wherein all the film's virtue resided, was was let down by Spike Jonze's utterly uninspired direction. At the very least the film was based on an excellent idea and didn't quite make it.""Adaptation"", also written by Charlie Kaufman and also, alas, directed by Spike Jonze, is certainly let down by not being particularly well made, but the surprise is it's also not particularly well written, and far from not being based on a good idea isn't based on any idea at all. Someone charged with the task of making a film has made a film about his inability to make said film. This kind of dodge, I feel sure, can only result in a good film just once - at MOST - in the entire history of cinema. Some people think Fellini's ""Eight and a Half"" is that film. It may be; I haven't seen it; I wouldn't know. But the successful I-can't-make-a-film film is certainly not ""Adaptation"".My partner commented afterwards that she remembered writing this kind of story in high school and thinking to herself: ""Wow! This is SO much easier than writing a real story!"" Not only was she right; who hasn't had this experience? And who hasn't had the spurious feeling of liberation - hopefully also as a teenager - that comes with the idea that simply showing an awareness of one's own stylistic defects is enough to negate them? This film is a self-indulgent, narcissistic w**k; Kaufman's no idiot (perhaps the most courageous thing he's done with this film is to convince his prospective employers that he's all intelligence and no talent), so in writing himself into his screenplay he simply makes himself SAY that he's being a self-indulgent and narcissistic w***er, which somehow makes it okay. The first-person voice-over IS a bad device, and Kaufman's particular voice-over IS a paticularly flabby and lazy one; so he has a scene in which his voice-over is shouted down by some sceenwriting guru talking about how flabby and lazy voice-overs are. The guru is right. Kaufman knows the guru is right. He wants us to know that he knows. Is the joke on us, on Kaufman, or on the guru? That, nobody knows, and to be frank I couldn't care less.In any event I feel like sending the whole thing back to the studio and ask that this time it be worked on by a director with the gift of making scenes, characters, or ideas - notice I said ""or"", although ""and"" would be even nicer - come to life. An wispy project like this needs at least that much."
40,Adaptation.,1,20 November 2003,Boring..,"this is probablly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen..  It was a complete waste of time and money! Bye the way, I think Nicolas Cage is a terrible actor, maybe the problem of the movie was him. I think the movie is way to over rated!"
41,Adaptation.,,14 July 2003,"Hooray! Another inventive, original, funny and mind blowing movie from Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman!","I absolutely LOVED 'Being John Malkovich', still one of the most astonishing and inventive movies of the last twenty years. I was excited and yes, a little apprehensive, about Director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman teaming up again. I honestly didn't think they could get lightning to strike twice, but boy, was I wrong! 'Adaptation' is just as enjoyable and as original as 'Malkovich', and is even more effective emotionally. That's what I really like about Kaufman's scripts. He isn't just dazzling us with crazy Italo Calvino-like plot twists and strange Vonnegutian situations without an underlining seriousness and human touch. I really FELT for Charlie (Nicholas Cage) in this movie. And like Malkovich he manages to provoke thoughts about creativity, art, fantasy and ""reality"" while still giving us a hilarious comedy. Bravo! And Jonze is a wonderfully creative director, who has very credibly made the transition from music video to the big screen. Nicholas Cage is fantastic in the duel role of the Kaufman twins. He seemed to be losing his way there for a while, reinventing himself as an action hero in big, dumb movies, but 'Adaptation' reminds you of the more quirky and interesting work he did earlier in his career like 'Birdy', 'Raising Arizona', 'Vampire's Kiss' and 'Wild At Heart'. Meryl Streep and underrated character actor Chris Cooper ('Lone Star', 'American Beauty') are also both superb, and there are some great performances from the supporting cast, most notably the brilliant Brian Cox ('Manhunter', 'Rushmore') who plays real life scriptwriting guru Robert McKee. I loved this movie from start to finish. It's so good words fail me! See it now!"
42,Adaptation.,1,14 February 2004,A pathetic adaptation of a boring book,"The Susan Orleans book ""The Orchid Thief"" that gave rise to this film was boring and plotless. To make a decent movie out of it was well nigh impossible, a labor of Hercules at the very least. The film is built around a character played by Cage and not in the book, a screenwriter who is a boring nerd looking for a peg upon which to hang a screenplay. The ensuing action is totally absurd and unworthy of the talents of Streep and Cooper. Pass on this one."
43,Adaptation.,6,29 January 2004,A neat idea that turns too formulaic,"In `Adaptation', Nicholas Cage portrays real-life scribe Charlie Kaufman, screenwriter of `Being John Malkovitch'. Cage also portrays Charlie's twin brother Donald, who does not exist in real life. Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper also play real people; Streep as journalist Suzie Orlean and Cooper as toothless wacko John LaRouche. Orlean wrote a popular book, The Orchid Thief, about LaRouche's attempt to find and pollinate the rare ghost orchid. But while they play real people, the events of the third act of the film no doubt never took place. John Cusack and Catherine Keener also pop up, playing themselves as the stars of `Being John Malkovitch', which, of course, they were. Confused?Charlie has been tapped to write the screenplay for Orlean's book. He is too steeped in self-loathing to be able to achieve this, a condition made worse when Donald attends a hack screen writing class and begins to pound out a cliched thriller involving a serial killer, his hostage, and the cop chasing them. While Donald finds the writing easy and energizing, Charlie feels lost in his attempts to turn a non-fiction book about flowers and Darwin's theory of adaptation into a cohesive and filmable script. He wrestles with himself, masturbates frequently, loses his girlfriend, and finds himself sinking deeper and deeper.It would unfair to describe any of the film's climax to anyone who has not seen it. But `Adaptation', after a clever and involving first two-thirds, overshoots itself and makes it's  points with the least amount of subtlety possible. It is still clever, to be sure, but clever in a 'look at me!' way that betrays the movie as much as Charlie's screenplay betrays everything he hates and Donald loves. Maybe it was too much to try and pound this thing out and maintain the level of creativity all the way through, but the last half-hour or so loses the zing that the previous hour sang with.Cage takes a tough job and makes it look easy. Resembling a less manic version of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, he creates two very realistic people with seeming ease. It's nice to see him actually act again, rather than striking another `Snake Eyes'-`The Rock'-`Gone in 60 Seconds' pose. Movies in which the same actor plays twins have always given me a headache figuring out the logistics of it (`Multiplicity', with Michael Keaton getting cloned over and over, nearly killed me), but Cage handles the actions in a non-showy way that let me forget my worries for a moment. Streep is as amazing as ever, playing a character going through massive changes and doing things she never thought she would do with the same dazzling skill most of us have taken for granted from her. And Cooper, best known as the militant and closeted neighbor in `American Beauty', really shines, avoiding the trap of turning the seeming nutjob into a character filled with profundities he's unaware of. He could have been a backwoods, toothless Forrest Gump, spouting shallow-yet-deep catchphrases, but Cooper makes him a three dimensional being, filled with faults and pain and yet not someone to be pitied.Kaufman and director Spike Jonze both worked togetheron `Malkovitch', a movie perfect from beginning to end. With `Adaptation' they stumble yet manage to produce a film better than most anything Hollywood could dream up."
44,Adaptation.,8,16 March 2014,Unique and a good opportunity for Nicholas Cage to show he could act.,"""Adaptation"" was nominated for four Oscars (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay) and won for Best Supporting Actor (Chris Cooper). For this reason alone I decided to watch the film. While I thought the film had a few minor problems, the film was highly original and sure kept me guessing.Nicholas Cage plays two parts in this film--that of two identical twin brothers, Charlie and Donald Kaufman. Charlie is a well-respected screenwriter who is filled with self-doubts and, inexplicably, never seems to quite know the right words to say until it is too later. Donald, on the other hand, is very different and through much of the film you think he's a bit of a moron. However, unlike Charlie, he has no doubts and seems to effortlessly get along with others.Charlie is struggling with his latest project. He is trying to make a screenplay from a seemingly impossible source--a book about a man who hunts orchids! And, as Charlie's writer's block gets worse and worse, Donald suddenly announces he's going to be a screenwriter as well! He goes to a one-day seminar on writing and then quickly writes a script that he immediately sells! What's next? Well, I'll clue you in on one thing--you could never guess what will happen with them as Charlie and Donald go on a journey to help Charlie over his rough period.This film was nice because it was so different and because Nicholas Cage stretched himself making a film with two such completely different characters. However, the one character with all his nasty anal comments that had nothing to do with the film left me perplexed. Also, listening to Meryl Streep dropping the frequent F-bomb also seemed out of place. Still, despite a few rough spots, it's worth seeing because of its originality and strange style."
45,Adaptation.,10,1 April 2009,Ingenious!,"I'm sure most people got this, but to those who didn't understand this film: I just finished watching Adaptation about 10 minutes ago, and 10 minutes ago Adaptation was kind of a bummer to me. While I was watching it, I didn't know what to think. at first, I was just a bit confused about what was real and what wasn't, and once the whole drug/porn/murder thing started, I was like ""Man this is just a lame ending to a great movie"". and about 5 minutes ago, I burst out laughing because I realized the meaning of the movie. Congratulations to: Charlie Kaufman. this movie is hardly about a book. Of course, the book recites some vital themes of the story. but essentially, the book is just fuel for Charlie Kaufman's ingenious prank. Charlie didn't ""cleverly insert"" himself into the film. the movie is ABOUT him. the movie is about his struggle to create a movie that is just ""about a flower"" with no Hollywood clichés like car chases, sex, drugs, murder, and especially split personalities. Charlie wants originality. Insulting his brother Donald's screenplay for just being a cheap thriller, Charlie falls into a depression because Donald's ideas are receipted more warmly than his own. After giving in and inviting Donald to help Charlie with his own screenplay, the film advances to contain the following: 1) a woman becomes a DRUG addict 2) a man gives her drugs so she will have SEX with him 3) The man and woman are caught by Charlie, and decide to MURDER him 4) they then partake in a CAR CHASE 5) Charlie Kaufman doesn't have a brother Donald, and this is supposed to be based on his real life, therefore Donald really represents his SPLIT PERSONALITYISN'T THAT ALL HILARIOUS???? I can't believe I didn't get it before. He betrays everything he initially hated in movies... this movie isn't about an orchid thief, its about Charlie Kaufman's indecision about whether he should stick to his originality, or succumb to the silliness of Hollywood. Its all a joke, and a glorious statement about Hollywood that I've been wanting someone to make for a long time. I love Adaptation and so should you."
46,Adaptation.,,26 March 2007,A metaphysical masterpiece (spoilers throughout),"Adaptation is kind of like a wonderful mixture of a Woody Allen movie and a Philip Roth novel. We're invited to laugh at the neurosis of an inadequate man, but at the same time the film plays with form, identity and the very nature of writing  there's a lot of stuff going on in the film, but Jonze and Kaufman walk the tightrope perfectly.Right from the opening voice-over I knew I was going to enjoy the movie, but it wasn't until the final third that I knew I was going to love it. This realisation came when Donald Kaufman, the mainstream, Hollywood alter-ego of Charlie, reads Susan Orlean's (Meryl Streep) computer screen from a great distance via a pair of binoculars. He reads the flight that she's taking and even interprets a phone call she makes, telling his brother: 'That was no parent phone call, my friend.' Suddenly your mind is cast back to the opening scene when Charlie tells a Hollywood producer about his plans for his screen adaptation of Susan Orlean's book. He says he doesn't want to make it into a drug movie, or a love story, or have car chases, or have the characters learn profound life lessons. But when Donald starts spouting his clichéd dialogue you finally realise that all these things are going to come true. And they're going to come true because Charlie has finally given up. He can't finish the script. So after Charlie's thoughtful, neurotic beginning, you get Donald's Hollywood ending, one where the characters snort drugs, have sex, fall in love, crash cars and suddenly get eaten by alligators. Which poses the question  is it possible to avoid the pitfalls of traditional storytelling? Adaptation certainly has great fun illustrating how difficult it is to overcome the familiar crutches. Right from the beginning you have producers giving their two cents and then you even have sex-obsessed agents sharing their views. How are you supposed to write a simple story about flowers when you have to compete with this? And then Charlie also has his twin brother to worry about, a man who attends screen writing classes and who writes a ridiculous script that has Charlie's sex-obsessed agent foaming at the mouth over. People just don't appreciate originality or anything that strays from the norm.But I think it says something about the film when this relationship is treated with great affection. It would be pretty easy to have Donald be the subject of intellectual ridicule, but instead he's treated with gentle exasperation. And it's also interesting that even in the terribly hackneyed scenes at the end that the film achieves a certain pathos. Indeed, the clichéd character revelations that take place in the swamp, while knowingly silly, also highlight the benefits of this type of storytelling. Yes, we know that it's hardly the time be getting touchy feely  they're in a swamp being chased by people with guns for god's sake  but we still can't help but react. And even the 'Don't go to sleep' scene works.Another element of the film that is rather sweet is Charlie's desire to stay true to the novel he's adapting. All the time he tries his hardest to translate the novel to the screen, but he just can't make it work. And I love the scene where he talks to Susan's picture. It's a wonderfully gentle, heartfelt scene and I like the subtle way that Susan's picture changes to complement the dialogue Charlie hears in his head  he's so desperate not to disappoint her.Other pleasures are a little more obvious. A fantastic bit of comedy occurs when Charlie imagines his producer (the gorgeous Tilda Swinton) reading his script and telling him he's a genius before having sex with him. Surely that's got to be every writer's fantasy  to have a beautiful woman compliment your work AND nail you.Another big laugh comes in the screen writing seminar Charlie attends. I just love the self-righteous indignation of Brian Cox's character, the way he screams with fury at the prospect of someone attempting to write a script where people don't change and nothing much happens. It's brilliant in the way that it mocks those people who say films have to stick to certain rules (no voice-over? What would Apocalypse Now be without it?) while both thumbing its nose at those conventions and adhering to them. Something else that cracked me up was Donald's description of an action scene in the thriller he's writing. He's describing it and you're laughing at the stupidity ('It's like technology versus horse') but then you realise it's exactly the same as the chase in True Lies. And if you're like me, you'll shamefully admit that you actually enjoyed that dumb scene.But although there are plenty of belly laughs in the film (is it just me or is that Malkovich speech at the beginning bloody hilarious? I have no idea whether it's scripted or not  I kind of hope it isn't  but either way it's a rib-tickler), you also have quite a tender little story at its heart about a woman trying to find some sort of meaning in her life. By chasing this orchid she's trying to find that elusive happiness that we all seek  we all think that if we could have this one thing (and the thing is different for everyone) that we'd be content. But the truth is that reality and fantasy are very different  it's the chase, the adventure that makes life worthwhile. Of course, Charlie (and Donald) realise that this particular journey isn't enough to fill a movie, but it does help give it a wonderful flavour. And it also helps link the real Susan and Charlie together  neither really got what they wanted, but you feel the journey's made them wiser."
47,Adaptation.,9,13 April 2006,Adapting Susan Orlean into Charlie Kaufman's Mind,"How can you write a successful adaptation from a book that is so far removed from being accessible? Charlie Kaufman doesn't have the answer, and is confounded that after three years, he hasn't come up with a convincing story and is sitting in the swamp of his own mind. He also has one of the most awkward personalities -- unable to fulfill a relationship with women, even when he daydreams about them. And he has a deadline. Charlie, apparently, is a hopeless case.Donald Kaufman, on the other hand, is Charlie's total opposite. They're identical twins, but couldn't be less similar. Donald is as free-spirited as Charlie is paranoid, and now they're going to share an apartment together. Donald has what Charlie lacks: a commercial approach to a subject matter, dictated by Robert McKee. He could care less about the intricate elements of creativity, he just wants to get the story out there and ""bam!"" Charlie eventually begins picking up a slow momentum on his story, which is a work of non-fiction written by Susan Orlean about an obsessive orchid dealer named John Laroche. Interestingly the story now switches focus from Charlie to Susan: we see how vapid her life has become, how she longs for something new, and how writing about this unattractive man who loves orchids as if they were delicate jewels has made her open up to him, to experience which includes a little drug-intake while Laroche plasters pictures of her likeness over naked female bodies on his site.Charlie is also falling for Susan as his own work takes shape, and in one stroke of genius, her photo starts talking to him from his book's jacket. I wonder if the same didn't happen to Laroche since there is an interesting mirroring of a man devoted to a woman's likeness even when Laroche has initiated an affair of sorts with her. In any case, Susan literally comes out of the book and onto Charlie's lap. Of course, the real woman is a lot nastier than he would imagine as he gets to know later on, but that's not really the point. ADAPTATION has to be one of the oddest, most original films in a long time -- a film about a man adapting a book which is to become a movie while events from the past and the present and even from way back, when dinosaurs ruled, are woven into a seamless fabric. The stroke of genius is not so much the story and its Moebius strip logic but that Charlie includes himself and the reality of his previous movie, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, plus many other realities, into this work of fiction, and in doing so creates such a weird, intertwining tale that may cause a headache on first view and may also require multiple viewings to grasp its significance.And who ever said Nicholas Cage couldn't act (despite his win for LEAVING LAS VEGAS) is wrong: he sheds his persona for this schlub of a man and his cockier brother -- like Jeremy Irons in DEAD RINGERS, it's very easy to see where one begins and the other ends. Meryl Streep takes a gamble and creates a fully fleshed out eccentric discovering love through ugliness. Chris Cooper dissolves his own identity into that of John Laroche. Catherine Keener, John Malkovich also make tiny appearances in the BEING JOHN MALKOVICH sequence. Tilda Swinton, Judy Greer, Maggie Gylenhaal, Ron Livingston, and Stephen Tobolowsky also make small appearances here. A winner of a film!"
48,Adaptation.,3,26 February 2004,"Not top 250!!!  Not even top 1,000...","Wow.  I cannot imagine that anyone would give this movie a 10/10 (I gave it a 3).  Were we watching the same movie?  I'm not sure... my wife enjoyed it (she said maybe a 6 or 7) but I found it completely unengaging.Cage's performance was unguided, while Streep was simply wasted.  I was left with an *overwhelming* sense that the producer and director wanted to believe that the audience was gullible enough to be entertained by just the reflective twist.  It failed, badly, although it would have been an okay addition to a movie that had *something*else* going for it.
The only character I didn't want to eliminated was the ""other"" brother (also Cage).  The main characters should have been off'ed early in the movie. The ending was pathetic (literally, it would have evoked sympathy if I hadn't been subjected to it).  And the idea of a movie about a blocked writer who writes about a blocked writer -- it is *NOT* interesting.The comparison to _Being_John_Malkovich_ is not completely unwarranted, but neither is a comparison with a mediocre performance of a high school play. Frankly, it astounds me that this movie is (currently) in the top 250, or even in the top 1000.THE BOTTOM LINE: don't bother.  Read a book, catch up on paying your bills, or play tik-tak-toe by yourself -- it will be time better spent (okay *maybe* not the tik-tak-toe)."
49,Adaptation.,5,21 January 2003,you shouldn't have listened to your screenwriting teacher,"This movie starts out like an interesting movie, about interesting characters that are creative people. the storytelling is original, so you think this might be a good movie about the relationship between reality, movies, and literature. but the movie is just a trick, the themes are mentioned but not explored, and in a whole this movie has nothing realy interesting to say. Toward the end if fails to keep its promises, and turns into the similiar hollywood narative, a movie about character redemption. That side of the movie which is not well directed or performed, or written, ruined everything else for me."
50,Adaptation.,9,25 January 2003,Delightfully bizarre and warped,"This is a really strange movie.I am not going to bore you with a plot synopsis that some people insist on putting in their comments (what is the point, really?) but this film is most definitely NOT the book ""The Orchid Thief"" come to life on the screen.The characters are there, kind of, but have been delightfully warped and mutated into a funny, hilarious movie that just makes you think and laugh out loud and wonder ""what was Charlie Kaufman ON when he wrote this screenplay???"".I would recommend seeing it twice to really get the full benefit of the movie --- Chris Cooper and Meryl Streep are just amazing their interpretations of the characters they play, and Nicolas Cage is stunningly brilliant as Charlie and Donald Kaufman caught up in writer's block / twin jealousy and the weird goings-on in the swamps of Florida.
A good way to spend a night at the movies...just hold on for a ride not normally found in a Florida theme park!!!"
51,Adaptation.,10,27 November 2006,"The Funniest, Craziest, Just Plain Best Movie About Writing and Writers I've Seen!","ADAPTATION is an insane little movie that all writers and anybody interested in the process of writing should rent or buy ASAP; I love it as much today as I did when I saw it in my local multiplex on opening weekend back in 2002! So far, it's my favorite movie collaboration between director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, the madmen who brought us BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (some of whose cast cameos in ADAPTATION, since it begins on the set of BJM). A friend described it as ""the most f***ed-up movie I've ever seen,"" meaning it as a compliment, and I could understand why! The story of how Kaufman agrees to adapt Susan Orlean's literate, thoughtful book THE ORCHID THIEF into a screenplay is the best movie about writers and writing I've seen, with David Cronenberg's adaptation of William S. Burroughs' NAKED LUNCH running a very close second. Kaufman's script slyly and surreally spoofs everything from writer's block (we could really identify with poor blocked Charlie's thoughts in voice-over as he wills himself to write: ""I need coffee. And a muffin. No, I'll have coffee and a muffin after I write, as a reward...""), to movie clichés, to the Robert McKee screen writing seminar (having gone to one of these with FANGORIA's Mike Gingold several years ago, I can vouch for the verisimilitude of these scenes, including Brian Cox's on-target performance as McKee). Meryl Streep gives one of her best comedic performances in years as Susan Orlean, the prim NEW YORKER writer who slowly unravels as she becomes more and more enthralled with orchid poacher John Laroche, engagingly played by Chris Cooper, who truly earned his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Nicolas Cage gives a tour-de-force performance as both paralyzingly insecure sad sack *artiste* Charlie and his charming, eager hack writer twin brother Donald. Even though the brothers look alike -- encroaching baldness, pot bellies, and all -- you can tell at a glance which one is which simply from the expressions on their faces and the way they carry themselves; Cage truly makes Charlie and Donald individuals. Even so, since they clearly represented two sides of the writer's art, I wouldn't have been surprised if Donald had turned out to be a figment of Charlie's fevered imagination. Whenever the two of them were conversing in the same room and other people were around, I half-expected somebody to walk in and say, ""Hey, Charlie, who ya talking' to?"" :-) Though some friends had to ponder it for a while, my hubby and I think folks who complained about ADAPTATION's wild 'n' crazy final reel missed the point. By then, Charlie was getting so enmeshed in the screenplay and the reel and real versions of its characters that life was beginning to imitate art, with every cliché Charlie feared coming to life before his eyes whether he wanted it to or not. (Indeed, how do we know the whole thing wasn't some mad hallucination on Charlie's part? :-)) My fave line: Donald's ""You become what you love, not what loves you."" My second fave line: John's response to Susan's stoned musings on the shininess of ants: ""Darlin', you're shinier than any ant."" And after the scene where Susan first gets high on orchid dust, I've never been able to listen to my telephone's dial tone quite the same way. :-)Of course, one of ADAPTATION's cleverest jokes was the real-life Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for both Charlie and Donald Kaufman. If you don't understand why that's funny, you obviously haven't seen ADAPTATION, so get ahold of it ASAP and enjoy. Watch it with the writers in your life! :-)"
52,Adaptation.,7,16 February 2004,Clever but a little boring,"This clever, self referential movie is just a little too clever to be really amusing. It is highly original, and as it develops it seems to write its own script. This is a film which kept me thinking for twenty minutes after it was over, so on that basis it has to rate highly. On the other hand, it is clearly meant to be funny and for me the jokes did not come off. I think this is simply because the writer ran ahead left and left me behind in his cleverness. Maybe it would improve on a second viewing."
53,Adaptation.,1,25 June 2003,What. A. Mess!,"Ye GODS this thing is sophomoric!  Is this the future of film writing and production? Lowered, I hope not. This thrashing mess is supposed to be (either/and/or) on-the-edge/ quasi-surreal/ performance art on film.  Isn't it?  Whatever was intended (if anything,) Jonze and his dabbling, babbling twin writers (are THEY real?) have turned out a thorough mess of a movie and a waste of talented actors."
54,Adaptation.,3,24 December 2002,Disappointing at best,"Spoilers Having Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufmann reunited once again after their hilarious coupling in ""Being John Malkovich"", the most original and zaniest comedy in years, the expectations for this future film were high. Unfortunately, this film does not deliver. Adaptation is one-trick pony which really runs out of ideas pretty fast... much faster than its protagonist.  The problem is the movie never decides what it wants to be and, this time around, the crazy combination of ideas, just does not work at all.  And while Kauffman is likely a good screenwriter, his alter ego is not that interesting to watch. The main thread following Charlie Kauffman as he struggles to adapt a book that is not movie material at all is simply not deep enough.  After we see him be stuck in front of his typewriter, being ignored by coworkers, how he struggles with his relationships and how he relieves his frustrations masturbating... well, there's not much else to see and what we saw... let's face it... was pretty cliche.  And yes, the inner monologues are not funny enough to be justified. His fictitious brother Donald could have been the salvation: an odd-couple pairing who could have contributed to Charlie's additional frustrations. But Donald's role is kept to one side, never being the annoying brother that could have been and most laughs seem to be of Charlie's putting down Donald, which makes Charlie even less sympathetic. And finally, the somewhat real/fictitious story of Chris Cooper (as the real Laroche on which the book is based) and Meryl Streep (as Susan Orlean, the reporter for the New Yorker and author of the book) is quite out of place. On one hand, it is being set-up as a variation of The Bridges of Madison County but the film never seems to find the subtlety or touching feeling of such a movie.  And when juxtaposed with the other stories... well, we know Kauffman is pulling our leg already.  Problem is... this backfires... we just end up not caring about any of the characters in that way.  Quite frankly... if this was the real draft of The Orchid Thief that Charlie was stuck with... well, it was a pity he was not good screenwriter enough to try adapting the screenplay seriously.  It could have been decent, instead of this crap he ended up with. Unlike ""Being John Malkowich"" where we never knew where we were going and we were laughing aloud during the process, Adaptation generates only some tiny little smiles at best. Probably the best character ends up being Charlie's agent, who in a short scene, instead of listening to Charlie's issues, spends his time boasting of his sexual conquests in the office.  That is likely the only scene really funny. And well... what can you say about the last half-hour of the movie?  That Donald wrote it?  Being John Malkovich also suffered from a last act that was a little out of sync with the rest of the movie, but we forgave Charlie for it, since the rest had been so brilliant. However, when the final act of Adaptation arrives, you just cannot be other than angry for just having wasted an hour and a half in the theatre.It may be funny to Kauffman, but not to the audience. In summary, skip this movie.  Your time is better spent with The Two Towers, Gangs of New York or About Schmidt this holiday season."
55,Adaptation.,1,7 July 2003,Adapting to monotony,"Question: When does one come to the realization that a movie is desparately shaping up to be ONE HUGE BOREFEST? Answer: When one begins FAST FORWARDING thru the Dvd just 30 minutes into said movie. Well, I finally found a movie WORSE than Being John Malkovich, and its Adaptation. This stuff must appeal to the lonely losers and schmoes of the world. If this is ""high art"", I'll take Armageddon type flicks ANYDAY. Score: 1 (AWEFUL) Btw, the Dvd transfer is as rotten as the flick."
56,Adaptation.,,21 March 2003,"Less Mind, More Heart, will have done the trick....","Below is my personal view only and its not intended to offend (Knowing how many Jonze/ Kaufman fans there may be in this board...)While I acknowledge the film do boast the best writing around, therein lies its major flaw as well. Its too clever and self-referential for its own good. Its like the Kaufman twins(:-)) are bursting with pride, revelling in their inventive idiosyncracies and expect the whole wide world to join them in their self-congratulation.Good writing does not a good movie make. The film is way too gimicky in my book. Worst still, it took the easy way out by disguising its lack of care for its characters with fantastical cop-outs and self-deprecatory hunmour.
Personally, I don't think Adaptation regards the audience' emotional investment that much. Infact, it's utter lack of emotional truths(after a deceptive emotional build-up) borders on audience condescension.
To illustrate my case, I thus draw comparison between a writer/director who cared for its characters & audience(i.e. Magnolia's P T Anderson) and one which puppeteers them (the Jonze/ Kaufman team). Another TV example, will be a character-loving Aaron Sorkin(West Wing) vs a snobbish sensationalistic people-ridiculing David E. Kelley(Practice/ Ally). No prizes for guessing which team I prefer.By stating ""preference"", I thus acknowledge that Kaufman's style is merely not my cup of tea but his talents as a writer cannot be denied. It thus all boils down to personal taste. To me, even the idiosyncratic Coen Bros exhibits more humanistic instincts than Kaufman and gang.
In case I sounded too harsh on Adaptation, let's just say I expect so much more from someone who can do so much more. In their chase for the creative excellence, I do hope the beautiful minds behind Being John Malkovich can too leave some space for a genuine heart in their future endeavour.
With this, I rest my case. G'nite."
57,Adaptation.,,17 December 2002,Identity is the hardest life-adaptation; one of the year's best!,"ADAPTATION (2002) **** Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Tilda Swinton, Cara Seymour, Judy Greer, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Ron Livingston, (Cameos as themselves: John Malkovich, Catherine Keener, John Cusack). Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman, the dream team that brought you `Being John Malkovich', reunite in fine, giddy form in this highly original, funny and surprisingly poignant high concept comedy about screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Cage in one of his best roles since winning the Oscar) and his twin brother Donald (Cage again, brilliantly imbuing two distinct yet dissimilar identities nonetheless) a wannabe at odds with his own identity as he attempts to adapt `The Orchid Thief', Susan Orlean's best-selling non-fiction account of fauna rebel John Laroche (respectively Streep and Cooper in equally award caliber turns), into a motion picture screenplay with great difficulty.  So great he winds up inserting his neurotic, anxious persona into the work itself with some unexpected results and eye-opening moments of clarity en route to his goal: adapting the impossible (a pretty good metaphor for life itself as the film's goal clearly is spelled out). All three principals are effectively wonderful and pitch perfect in their slightly off comic performances that somehow intertwine with an almost alchemic chemistry.  The real Kaufman (who shares' credit with his fictional twin Donald) is clearly in a league by himself as this mind-bending film is as well, depicting the craft of screenwriting as if conjuring up personal demons inflicted by ego in the form of persona non grata .  Jonze once again proves to be a true filmmaker with his own unique, oddball visuals and techniques at full tilt yet achieves something completely unanticipated: melancholy nirvana. Truly one of the best films of the year."
58,Adaptation.,1,9 June 2003,"Yeah, whatever.","""Being John Malkovich"" gave me the impression that its ideal form was a short story. Whether or not I'm right about that, Charlie Kaufman's screenplay, wherein all the film's virtue resided, was was let down by Spike Jonze's utterly uninspired direction. At the very least the film was based on an excellent idea and didn't quite make it.""Adaptation"", also written by Charlie Kaufman and also, alas, directed by Spike Jonze, is certainly let down by not being particularly well made, but the surprise is it's also not particularly well written, and far from not being based on a good idea isn't based on any idea at all. Someone charged with the task of making a film has made a film about his inability to make said film. This kind of dodge, I feel sure, can only result in a good film just once - at MOST - in the entire history of cinema. Some people think Fellini's ""Eight and a Half"" is that film. It may be; I haven't seen it; I wouldn't know. But the successful I-can't-make-a-film film is certainly not ""Adaptation"".My partner commented afterwards that she remembered writing this kind of story in high school and thinking to herself: ""Wow! This is SO much easier than writing a real story!"" Not only was she right; who hasn't had this experience? And who hasn't had the spurious feeling of liberation - hopefully also as a teenager - that comes with the idea that simply showing an awareness of one's own stylistic defects is enough to negate them? This film is self-indulgent and narcissistic; Kaufman's no idiot (perhaps the most courageous thing he's done with this film is to convince his prospective employers that he's all intelligence and no talent), so in writing himself into his screenplay he simply makes himself SAY that he's being self-indulgent and narcissistic, which somehow makes it okay. The first-person voice-over IS a bad device, and Kaufman's particular voice-over IS a particularly flabby and lazy one; so he has a scene in which his voice-over is shouted down by some sceenwriting guru talking about how flabby and lazy voice-overs are. And the guru is dead right. So now we know that Kaufman wants us to know that he knows how bad his own voice-overs are. It's impossible work out who or what this complicated and unfunny joke is at the expense of, and also impossible to care.In any event I feel like sending the whole thing back to the studio and ask that this time it be worked on by a director with the gift of making scenes, characters, or ideas - notice I said ""or"", although ""and"" would be even nicer - come to life. An wispy project like this needs at least that much."
59,Adaptation.,9,7 January 2003,Orchids,"Spike Jonze proves again that with the right ingredients he can create a film as original as this one. Of course, he couldn't have made it, were it not for the genial collaboration with Charles Kauffman, who will probably go on to be a film director in the not too distant future.This is a film where fiction and fantasy mix freely. Mr. Kauffman takes the difficult task to develop the original book by Susan Orlean into a filmable script from a novel that, at best, would not translate into cinematic treatment.Mr. Kauffman's twin brother Donald enters the picture as a self-centered opportunist who wants to capitalize on his own brother's skills to create a scenario for a film and sell it for millions to a Hollywood studio. He doesn't care what pains he causes to his suffering brother who's so involved in his own problem with the adaptation of the original book. Nicolas Cage pulls off the double role, showing us one moment Charlie's agony for not being able to do the job and the carefree brother Donald, who is just his opposite.Fact and fiction mingle freely in presenting the book's own author, Susan Orlean, as she was researching the book and her involvement with John Laroche, the orchid thief.Meryl Streep can give great performances.At times she comes across as very studied and very artificial. In this film, and credit must go to Mr. Jonze, she shows us a fun seeking individual who feels the attraction for a world so different from her own and her own attraction for orchids.It's a shame that talented Chris Cooper is not given many more opportunities to show how good he really is. In this film he outdoes himself. He gives us a fine detailed performance. His John Laroche is pure perfection. He plays without bringing attention to himself. He's an actor's actor."
60,Adaptation.,8,27 October 2005,A film that needs multiple viewings,"Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's attempts to adapt Susan Orlean's ""the Orchid Thief"" is hampered by Hollywood expectations, his twin brother, and his own inadequacies, in this fictionalized true-life story. This is possibly the most in-joke laden and densely quirky of Writer Charlie Kaufman's already deep cannon. However it remains a good film, due in no small part to Nicholas Cage's dual performances of the 'twin brothers'/dueling psyches. A film that is nearly a complex and awe inducing as an orchid itself, it may be very off-putting to watch for the first time but I suggest to stick with it, for it's a movie that holds up rather well with repeat viewings.My Grade: B+ DVD Extras: Cast & crew filmographies; and Theatrical Trailer Easter Egg: Highlight ""Play"" & press up to highlight a hidden red phone. Press enter to get a phone number to call to leave a message. (which has been long disconnected so why didn't I even bother to include it as an easter egg?)"
61,Adaptation.,9,10 September 2005,"very good movie, but not for everyone","I am not sure I would recommend this to everyone, but if you hate standard Hollywood garbage that usually has ""plot twists"", car chases, gun play, and no character development, you might enjoy this one.Basically, if you don't like Jerry Bruchheimer films, you will probably like this one. It is ironic, that Nicolas Cage starred in Con Air and Adaptation. The two films could not be more different Nicolas Cage does surprisingly well in this role. If you watch this movie, pay attention to the details. There are a lot of things in the movie that people will miss.spoiler??: I particularly like the use of Deus Ex Machina. (I don't think that qualifies as a spoiler)"
62,Adaptation.,,12 January 2004,Bizarre,"This is a bizarre film. Having finally watched it I can see why Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper all received Oscar nominations for their roles while the film itself missed out. It is described as a comedy but I don't think I laughed once. The story is hard to follow, there are long boring passages where little happens, and the ending is too weird for serious consideration. We are left with more unanswered questions than answered ones. The film is passably enjoyable in places, but overall is pretty unsatisfying. 5 out of 10."
63,Adaptation.,,17 June 2003,"It's been done before, and better","It had Oscar nominations and my friends liked it, so I finally saw ""Adaptation"".  Except for Nicolas Cage's performance, it was disappointing. That colossal setup to teach us to trust in love?""Hit and Runway"" uses a similar device - a guy writes a screenplay about his experience writing a screenplay - and it is funnier, cleverer, and much more rewarding than ""Adaptation.""And one more thing: didn't the ghost orchids look pretty phony?"
64,Adaptation.,2,28 May 2003,Please don't waste your time with this one,"I regret not having rented ""The Hot Chick"" instead! This movie is terrible, awful, and too long. Actually, it deserved points for good acting and cinematography. But what good does the acting do when the movie's plot and story are so poorly delivered that you don't really care about the ending or the characters? It's pretty dreadful and painful to endure."
65,Adaptation.,2,24 May 2003,Totally Narcissistic,"What a disappointment. The cast did well, but the screenplay was the screenwriter's ""valentine to himself."" I should move to hollywood and become a screen writer. If I get an assignment and can't do it, I can always do what Kaufman did...write about my inability to write it. I'm sure that my employers would understand. The persona of the neurotic loser who can't pick up girls started to wear thin early in the movie as well as Kaufman's masturbatory fantasies. And talk about your Dei ex machina...when you can't think of anything else, just send in a 'gator. This movie goes a long way in explaining the sad state of Hollywood today."
66,Adaptation.,3,8 February 2003,No pay off,"Great acting, interesting story, genuine out loud laughs, a build up that leaves you eager for the big payoff, then poof: the movie sucks.  What a disappointing waste of an evening.  Even if I can intellectually appreciate what the screenplay is doing, if it doesn't work after all the potential displayed in the first hour and a half, its just that much more of a disappointment.  The ending was a copout. Period."
67,Adaptation.,,25 January 2003,Selling out,"'Adapation.'  The opening was brilliant and the first hour/hour-and-a-half was equally immersive.  While I sat through the film, I was becoming increasingly convinced that I was going to own it someday.  Being a screenwriter myself, I felt the SCRIPT was speaking to me directly and compelling ME to write BETTER scripts.Then the film sold out.  It knew it would sell out, it was aware that it would sell out, and it probably planned on selling out from the moment Kaufman began writing ""Kaufman's"" inner monologue.  Man, this has to be a work of post-post-post modernism--a world in which *everything has been done* and scripts ABOUT how *everything has been done* have (ALSO) already *been done.*In 'Adaptation,' we witness a film collapsing on itself.  Just like '12 Monkeys' but with scathing self-awareness.  Just like 'Get Shorty' but without cheer or a smug wittiness.  With 'Adaptation,' we understand that there might be a film out there about orchids somewhere, but it's not this one.  This one is about selling out.I say 'selling out' because we have a film that does so only because the characters all do so.  Donald sells out to Robert McKee's screenwriter ""principles,"" Laroche sells out one thing at a time (fish, flowers, porn), Orlean realizes she has nothing worth selling at all, and Charlie sells out by writing the most pandering, backdoor finish to his movie as we witness it.Lately I've really found myself enjoying films where nobody dies, nobody falls in love, and nothing too darn exciting happens at all.  Charlie Kaufman probably likes those films, too--but realizes that ""Charlie Kaufman"" can't possibly write one of them.  That's too bad, because his/""his"" film started out so incredibly well."
68,Adaptation.,5,1 September 2003,One Hit Wonder,"The blurring between fiction and reality in this film is absolutely delicious.  After viewing it, you'll be doing some research to try and figure out which parts were true to life...and to what extent.Kaufman's self-deprecation is genuinely entertaining, and very respectable. One gets the feeling he's being brutally honest.All that being said, all together the film is at best mediocre. Definitely a rental instead of a purchase, and if you never get to see the film you're not exactly missing a landmark of modern cinema.Adaptation doesn't live up to Being John Malkovich, Kaufman's breakthrough film.  Musically, Kaufman would be a The-Verve-Pipe-esque One Hit Wonder band.  Adaptation is that second release that gets played on the radio for about a month before everyone realizes that it's just not very good, no matter how great the first release was."
69,Adaptation.,10,31 January 2010,The best film of 2002.,"Director Spike Jonze really amazed me with 1999's Being John Malkovich. Jonze has only directed three films to date. Being John Malkovich being his first. Wow what a debut. His most recent was Where the wild things are. I loved that one too. His second film was Adaptation, which I think was his best.Adaptation has all of the ingredients to which I loved Being John Malkovich for. It's unique, very interesting, funny, weird, and towards the end, suspenseful. Spike Jonze is one of the best directors there is. The man has only directed three films and amazed me with all of them. Somebody should really send a letter to people like Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Spike Jonze saying to do more. Cause they are all excellent films. Adaptation reunites Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman once again. But here they doing something very different. In the film, the main character complains about screenwriters who write themselves into the screenplay. Kaufman does that. The lead character in the film is Charlie Kaufman(played excellently by Nicolas Cage). The film is about Charlie trying to adapt a screenplay for a book called The Orchid Thief written by a woman named Susan Orlean(played by the best there is, Meryl Streep).Orlean tries to get know one of the characters in her book. But the actual person(played by Chris Cooper in his Oscar winning performance). He is a guy who was taken to court for trying to take some Orchids or something like that.Kaufman's brother Donald(also played by Nicolas Cage) helps him write his screenplay also. Cause he realizes that it isn't going anywhere. Eventuallye, he ends up writing himself into the screenplay and he eventually needs help from Susan herself. But that doesn't turn out too well.While watching Adaptation, I was very intrigued and interested. But in the final act, I had realized that this was an amazing movie. I loved this movie. Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman are such a great team. I loved this movie for the reasons I loved Being John Malkovich. The performances especially Nicolas Cage's were fantastic. There are many great directors out there. Spike Jonze is one of them. I can't wait to see him do another one.Adaptation: A"
70,Adaptation.,7,7 September 2004,Two Movies - One great; One so-so,"<spoilers ahead>Until the brothers decide to follow the author Susan to Florida, the movie moves with a certain taut neurotic rhythm. I admired Nicholas Cage's acting, though both brothers suffered from mono-dimensional presentations. Ms. Streep gave a nice nuanced performance, though nothing about her character's situation involved original issues. That said, Chris Cooper's presence and performance simply steals the show. Once the plot moves on to the ""action"" sequences, it's the River Wild in the swamps. Nothing unexpected here. In fact, the one brother's death was telegraphed like a bad toupee in a spot light. Seems the script writer ran out of ideas and gave it over to the ghost writer orchids to finish."
71,Adaptation.,2,25 August 2004,A tiresome movie.,"A tiresome movie. The self referential aspect (Kaufman/Cage writing the script for a movie that was actually this movie) was not a clever twist, just irritating and not done at all subtly (which might have been OK). To discover that the real writer of this film is called Kaufman just makes this seem like a huge exercise in self obsession. A poor idea, with poor execution.It was also difficult to justify the sudden change in many of the characters at various points, but particularly the change to Susan Orlean at the end. That ending seemed to be tacked on to finish off the film. Perhaps the idea of the changes was further self reference - the writer desperate to finish of the script of the film anyway that he could and inject more excitement, but because he is now effectively living in the film he is writing about, what happens to him takes that same desperate and discontinuous twist.So while this film does perhaps have some interesting underlying concepts to pontificate about, it come across as a tiresome film that is just trying too hard to be clever."
72,Adaptation.,6,11 August 2004,"Unique Format: Film About Screenwriting, But Contents Are Cliched","This self-portrait and self-indulgence of the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman supplies a unique format, a film about screenwriting--while numerous films about film directors are out there, this might be the first and only film about a screenwriter. Taking persons who exist in the real world, including Kaufman himself as a protagonist, into a fictitious setting, Kaufman blurs the line between fiction and reality; at the same time, it may be a token of friendships from him to these persons. Unfortunately, the main arguments, writer's block and sexual depression, are highly cliched and cancel the brilliance of the distinctive setting.The main characters are lovable and memorable. Nicholas Cage does a great job to differentiate two twin brothers, Charlie and Donald Kaufman, but the editing and the post-production could have made the double role look more natural. Like Being John Malkovich, this is Kaufman's work and the director Spike Jonze is again invisible."
73,Adaptation.,4,15 May 2004,"Wow, what an overrated movie...","I'm sorry, but I cannot understand what the critics are raving about. This movie is, in my opinion, boring. When the plot is so fresh and original, and the people involved are so talented - how could they end up this short? I don't know.I loved ""Being John Malkovich"" though, but this is light years behind that experience.
My grade:**** (4/10)/Evil Kid"
74,Adaptation.,,8 December 2003,Film-study on writing an over-rated script.,"I rented this film because of the rave reviews on the back of the box stating that it was a great comedy. While I watched it, I realized that it was not a comedy at all. I thought that it was a philosophical treatise on ""being"" as realized by the protagonist in his vain attempts at finishing his assignment. At the end, I realized once again that I had been had by the blurb writers and by the movie industry. This film was entertaining to watch while I identified with Kaufman and his problems, but when the film became ""the assignment"" I felt robbed and hoodwinked into watching a poor excuse for a film. Kaufman never resolves his problems, but only finishes the assignment by resorting to extraordinary events that in the film allow him to end it on a positive note, disregarding all the extraordinary events that occur near the end.A film that is not a comedy but is perhaps a study on the difficulties of writing a screenplay for a film. It may work as a movie for a film-study audience as such, as the picture is sacrificed for a catastrophic stream-of-consciousness scenario--not entertainment material in my books. This movie left me with a void.On a side note, while I found the movie entertaining in the beginning I must state that I found the lead actor playing the writer's brother annoying because I was always thinking that Nicolas Cage was playing both roles and this distracted me from being attentive to the film."
75,Adaptation.,,30 November 2003,Whuh?,"How could Jonze make a brilliant film like ""Being John Malkovich"", then sign on to direct this lunatic sideshow? He must have mistakenly thought that Kaufman can write better substance than he came up with for ""Adaptation"". If I want to listen to a whiny, sweaty, balding, Hollywood neurotic, I'll tune into ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", as it will at least bring a belly laugh with it."
76,Adaptation.,3,8 August 2003,Very Disappointing Follow-up to Being John Malkovich,"The premise is intriguing.  The parallel structures work for two-thirds of the film.  So much effort was put in by Cage in distinguishing the physical expressions and deportments of Charlie and Donald that he neglected to create a true working intimacy with Donald's soul. Hence, Donald's soul does not exist for the viewer, and he seems more like a gimmicky parlor trick than Charlie's actual brother.  This, in turn, makes it difficult to care about Donald.  But, Charlie is such a whiny one-note ball of angst that he doesn't come close to engaging our real interest for an entire movie.  Where director Spike Jonze still has captured our imagination with his mastery of duality is with the Chris Cooper character.  Cooper's performance was indeed worthy of the Oscar he won.  Meryl Streep seems at times to be reprising her portrayal of author Mary Fisher from She-Devil.  At times, this is engaging and amusing, but given the gravity the situation soon assumes, it proves to be too shallow a guise to sustain her character's dark side.  The cameos featuring Malkovich, Keener, and Cusack are brilliant. 
But, the last half hour falls apart so completely that anything positive that preceded it is deluged by its excesses."
77,Adaptation.,2,6 June 2003,Different from everything else out there but still not good,"Ok, I rented this DVD on a fluke from netflix.  They sent me this instead of 6-feet under so I had some prejudice against it, plus the fact that I didn't like ""Being John Malcovitch"". So I watched it anyway.  Warning Spoilers. Right Away I hated Charlie.  I saw no redeeming value in this over the top or under the bottom character.  He didn't make sense to me. How could a person like this ever be a functional human being let alone a screenwriter. While Cage does a great job with the character as written, I couldn't find the character as written believeable.  Then we go on to Orlean and Laroche who I really found interesting.  I liked their story.  But did they really have a story?  No, so you needed a frame which is Charlie's struggle with the script.  It almost works until the real Charlie that is the writer decides to throw every cliche into the end.  Basically the end is a parody of the advice McKee the screenwriting lectuerer was saying.  ""Give it a good ending"", too bad I saw this a mile away.  I wasn't shocked about Laroche's demise or Charlie's epiphany from his brother.  I was shocked about the car crash and Donald flying through the window but in hind site that makes sense, kill the fictional character.  So this movie is a set of cliches that are aranged in a non-cliche way till the end which goes to a formulaic ending.  Why is this movie so popular? Because it seems to be original. It is somewhat original but not enough for me.  thumbs down."
78,Adaptation.,9,28 January 2003,It's a movie about flowers,"I've been staring at the screen for at least ten minutes now.  My coffee is as fresh as the day. My furry monkey slippers are keeping my feet warm. If I were fat and balding with a camera on me right now, I could almost be Nicolas Cage in Spike Jonze's `Adaptation.'  It's classic art imitating life or maybe life imitating art.  Who can tell the difference these days? Charlie Kaufman certainly can't.  Cage plays Kaufman in this film about orchids that starts at the dawn of time and tries to answer that eternal question, `Why are we all here?'  Confused?  Allow me to explain. Charlie Kaufman is a screenwriter.  Just so we're all clear, I mean Charlie Kaufman, the real person, not the character Cage plays.  Right, Charlie Kaufman is a real person.  In fact, he's a successful real person.  His last time out, he wrote the ambiguous and complicated `Being John Malcovich'.  For his follow-up, Kaufman has re-teamed with `Malcovich' director Jonze to adapt Susan Orlean's novel, `The Orchid Thief' to the big screen.  Only something went terribly awry during the weeks of Kaufman's writing process.  He couldn't do it.  Or more to the point, he couldn't do it the justice he believed it deserved.  Before you know it, the man can't sleep or eat and becomes obsessed with believing he's a failure.  And right before he's about to snap, he figures it out.  The film becomes less about the novel and more about the process of adapting the novel.  So now, for our viewing enjoyment, Jonze presents us with a film, written by Kaufman, about Kaufman struggling with his own worst enemy, himself, and the arduous task of adapting a novel about orchids so that their simplicity and delicate splendour come across on screen, all the while adapting to his own doubting thoughts and everyday life.  Oh, and he lives with his twin brother Donald who is basically a manifestation of Charlie's own tortured psyche.  Any clearer?One of the major reasons that Charlie can't physically complete his adaptation of Orlean's novel is because he is hell-bent on not involving any Hollywood-type elements, thinking that they would take away or cheapen his vision of a movie about flowers or perhaps the simple beauty that life has to offer.  Of course he can not convey that beauty as a person who never really takes the time to smell the roses in the first place.  This incapability to truly stop, take the time to look around and appreciate what you see is what eventually leads to Charlie's block.  Like Orlean in her own novel, Charlie is striving to feel passionate about something.  What that something is, he doesn't know which drives him mad.  And again like Orlean in her own novel, Charlie begins his own quest to find the metaphoric ghost orchid, an extremely rare flower of immense beauty that is essentially unattainable.  It isn't until he understands that it's not the destination but the journey that Charlie can finally see how to complete his adaptation.(this is a partial review.  for whole review, e-mail me)"
79,Adaptation.,10,22 January 2003,Finally a movie with a tagline that has some meaning.,"Adaptation has a rather lengthy tagline, but the thing that I like about it is that, with the exception of the last six words, it is a tagline that summarizes the movie rather than advertises it. This is a rare film that is about its own creation and all of the adaptation that goes on in the lives of the people involved. Nicholas Cage takes on one of the smartest and most complex roles he's ever done, playing the parts of Charlie Kaufman and his fictional twin brother Donald, both of whom are screenwriters with polarly opposite ways of living (or not living) life and dealing with the world.
Meryl Streep plays the part of Susan Orlean, the author of the novel `The Orchid Thief,' which Charlie is desperately trying to adapt into a worthy film version, the hugely talented Chris Cooper takes on the toothless role of John Laroche, a man who is strangely proficient at adapting to the slings and arrows of the world around him, yet not quite that great at getting anywhere in life. He lives a rather run-down life, but escapes criticism for it because he seems so content with his situation.My favorite story here is the one dealing with Charlie and his twin brother Donald. Charlie is an introverted screenwriter who is incapable of approaching the writer of the novel that he is adapting, and he is so determined to create a great film out of a book that he enormously admires (and is enormously confused by), that it nearly drives him insane. His brother, on the other hand, takes some quick, cheap screenwriting class at some adult night school just to learn the absolute basics of screenwriting, and he throws together a huge hit, based on an idea that Charlie gave him as a joke.I saw Adaptation the same day that I saw National Security, About Schmidt, and Catch Me If You Can, and National Security was playing on the biggest screen. This is a travesty of modern society and the commerciality of today's cinema. THAT is what this part of Adaptation was about, and it's a message for audiences, because we are the ones responsible for the abysmal decline of the quality of modern movies. The reason that we are flogged with ridiculous movies like National Security and American Pie and Scary Movie and Big Momma's House and Donald's `The 3' is because we buy the tickets.
If George Lucas filmed an old washing machine spin-cycling itself across an old wooden floor, lit only by a single naked light bulb, and he called it Episode III, people would buy tickets by the millions, it would make tons of money, and then it would become a trend seen in movies to follow. Granted, that's not going to happen, but that is what Adaptation is trying to say. The people who write good movie scripts get yelled at by the lecturers of cheap screenwriting classes, and they go insane trying to get their intelligent movies seen by the public, who are not always as intelligent or receptive to intelligence as is often assumed during the screenwriting process.(spoilers) The part of John Laroche also parallels this descent into barbarism that the movie points out, as it presents Laroche as a man who has suffered a lot of bad situations and circumstances in life, but who adapts to what comes his way and gets along by whatever means are available and wherever the money happens to be at any certain time. He is at one point collecting beautiful orchids, which happens to be illegal except that he's collecting them for Indians, who have rights because of their traditional heritage, and because he never touches them. Sure, it turns out that the Indians use them for drug purposes, but he later turns to online employment, creating a pornographic website and amazing himself at how much money he brings in regardless of how terrible the content may be.Both of these professions are not the most respectable, but they illustrate a transition from nature to technology and from hallucinogens extracted from flowers to technology and pornography. This is an unmistakable step downward for society, because John represents a lower class of people who are intermingling with a higher class, such as authors of intellectual novels (such as Susan Orlean, with whom Laroche has a twisted sexual affair) and the screenwriters who adapt them into films. We live in a melting pot society, and it is up to everyone from the top of the social scale (however you may personally define it) to the bottom to prevent ourselves from reversing the process of evolution.Adaptation is not an easy movie to understand. It has a lot of strange twists and it looks back at itself across the barrier between a movie and it's own creation, intertwining a lot of different storylines and even ending in a climax that seems to belong in an entirely different movie, if not even an entirely different genre. But the film has an important message to deliver, not just about what kinds of movies people watch and the results of these ticket sales, but also about the overall state of American society and the ways that some people are forced to live in it. I can certainly understand a lot of people being put off by this film, it's not easy to follow, not easy to understand at many points, and not easy to swallow, but it is surely worth the effort to recognize what it's trying to say."
80,Adaptation.,9,3 February 2017,A surreal tangle of metatext,"Much like Spike Jonze's and Charlie Kaufman's other creative endeavor 'Being John Malkovich', this is a movie that's drenched in layers of metatext. It's a movie that's about the making of itself, starring the film's creators as its characters. Nicolas Cage plays the screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, and also his fictional twin brother Donald Kaufman (who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay despite not really existing), and Meryl Streep plays Susan Orlean, the writer of the book 'The Orchid Thief' that the movie is based on.Because the screenplay is so dense most of the movie is focused on untangling the mess of reality and fiction - or, rather, tangling them up even more so that by the end you have to check Wikipedia for what is real and what isn't. Actually the book that this 'adaptation' is based on drops to the background, and the movie is more about the creative process. Meryl Streep's performance is hilarious and Nicolas Cage is tragicomic in his resigned depression."
81,Adaptation.,9,6 January 2017,"If you have not seen this one yet, you should. There aren't many like this","Reviewed August 2011I am bowled over. No words to describe Charlie Kauffman's imagination and vision. I thought 'Being John Malkovich' was the craziest one can go, the same man behind it tops it in a couple of years. Credit should also go to the director, editor and a string of talented actors who give their best for transferring this complex multi layered script to the screen devotedly. I can think of 2 reasons why Charlie Kauffman did not win the Oscar. 1) Jury didn't know whether to look at it as original or adapted screenplay. 2) Charlie Kauffman took help from an imaginary Donald Kauffman. I am not sure how to put a brief synopsis of this movie like I do in most reviews, let me give it a try. Charlie Kauffman (Nicolas Cage) is stuck in a writer's block after he was asked to adapt a non- fiction book 'The Orchid Thief' about experiences of the author Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) with a plant enthusiast John Laroche (Chris Cooper). David Kauffman, a little dimwit yet relaxed identical twin of Charlie comes to stay with him and also planning to write a mass thriller. Charlie out of last resort plans to take help from his brother to finish the script. It definitely brings to mind two other movies though this is completely fresh, 'Stranger than Fiction' and 'Being John Malkovich'. Meryl Streep sleepwalks the role in her good way, Nicolas Cage's character resembles a bit of Craig Schwartz and he does a terrific job. Chris Cooper deserves the Oscar all the way. I would've given it a 100% had the climax not dragged a bit. The narration is mostly thoughts of the writer, he contradicts his thought process and seconds it back and forth through out. It was an amazing experience sitting through this and would definitely look forward to more of Charlie Kauffman's work. If you have not seen this one yet, you should. There aren't many like this."
82,Adaptation.,8,31 August 2015,One of my favorite movies,"I'm really late on the Adaptation train, like 13 years late. It took me a bit to ""get it"", but once I did I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Cage gives a great performance as Charlie Kaufman and his imaginary twin brother, which in itself is fantastic. Charlie is a socially awkward, neurotic, always in his head kinda guy, which is basically Nick Cage. This film is quirky to say the least and outright awkwardly funny. Seeing Cage fantasizing himself making love to pretty much every female is great, which further enhances the juxtaposition of Charlie and Donald (imaginary brother). The struggle of Susan (Meryl Streep) was real, and the side story of her interviewing/falling in love with the odd but intelligent John Laroche (Chris Cooper) was portrayed very well. Basically this movie was great because it was funny, weird, a little sad, had a bunch of different themes, and ended with a huge mocking of Hollywood movies (or at least that's how I took it). Would watch again."
83,Adaptation.,10,14 February 2015,Definitely Original And Refreshing,"Adaptation. is a comedy-drama metafilm that was based on Susan Orlean's non-fiction book entitled, The Orchid Thief.It features a talented cast led by Meryl Streep,Nicholas Cage and Chris Cooper,who won an Academy Award as a supporting actor together with Cara Seymour, Brian Cox, Tilda Swinton, Ron Livingston and Maggie Gyllenhaal.Charlie Kaufman wrote the screenplay and Spike Jonze directed the film.Charlie Kaufman is a gifted screenwriter.Unfortunately,he happens to be a neurotic one as he goes into deep depression,shyness towards the opposite sex and has difficulty doing his work.Once again,he was hired to do a project involving Susan Orlean's non-fiction book,The Orchid Thief which becomes a problem.He also has problems with his girlfriend,Amelia.Charlie's identical twin brother,Donald moves with his brother and has decided to follow his brother's footstep.Many events happen with both Charlie and Donald and things become somewhat complicated when they both trade places with their current situation with Donald doing Charlie's work like meeting Susan and writing the screenplay while Charlie attends the scriptwriting lessons that Donald is suppose to attend.Unexpected events happen that will forever change both Charlie and Donald's lives after this.This is definitely a refreshing and original film that one would surely enjoy.Nicolas Cage was great in his dual role as Charlie and Donald as well as Meryl Streep,who once again proves that he can perform at the highest level even in the wildest of turns.Also,Chris Cooper was truly deserving his Oscar.Despite the fact that the movie tries to come up with something never found in the film before,the events flowed smoothly and naturally that one do not see the effort exceeded by the A list actors and actresses in performances never seen before in their careers.Definitely,a must see for viewers who love great movies!!!!"
84,Adaptation.,8,5 January 2015,Truly original,"Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) is a neurotic screenwriter on the set of his movie 'Being John Malkovich' in 1998. He is uncontrollably sweaty in a meeting with movie executive Valerie Thomas (Tilda Swinton) who wants him to adapt Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep)'s novel ""The Orchid Thief"". He wants to stay true to the book and not Hollywood it up. The book is the story of John Laroche (Chris Cooper) who takes rare orchids from the Florida State Parks in the everglades using his Seminole Indian workers. Charlie starts developing feelings for his friend Amelia Kavan (Cara Seymour). His twin brother Donald is an easy-going slacker who decides to start screen writing. Surprisingly, Donald's clichéd multiple-personality murder thriller is a big hit while he is really struggling with the flower book.Returning to 'Being John Malkovich' is meta-insanity and a great stroke of genius. Donald and his screenplay is hilarious. This is real head-spinning and I love it. Some say people could be turned off by the self-references and the loopy writing. It's a bit of a challenge but it's never difficult to follow. The movie does take a twist at the end which I wish they hinted at earlier. Cage is at his best doing duo duty. This is one of the most original script ever devised."
85,Adaptation.,,4 January 2015,I still don't get it,"I'm the kind of guy that can sit through most movies and enjoy them well most of to time. This film, however, I just don't get it. I'm still not sure if the brother was actually the brother or a figment of his imagination. In the beginning it seems like Mr. Cage is delusional. Then it switches to scenes that show the brother is indeed a real person. Then back again. Then at the end, apparently he is real. Who knows? I like a film to be at least somewhat linear. When some director decides to throw something in to confuse the audience, well, guess what? They are confused. And probably disappointed. I did like the individual performances, but as a story, well, kind of a mess as far as I'm concerned."
86,Adaptation.,9,4 October 2014,No orchids for Mr Kaufman,"Where to start with a film like this? That's precisely the challenge that Kaufman sets himself except, it's not just the start that's torturing him, it's the middle and the end as well. Kaufman dramatises the dynamics of the act of writing in the same vein as Fellini does in 8½ except it's not the muse that's evaded him, it's his confidence, his imagination and his competence. Each step in trying to distill the contents of a semi-autobiographical novel seems to take him into the cloying depths of procrastination and fear. The structure is sublime. The film creeps forward in the same way as the writing of the screenplay, experimenting with options for the plot, with fantasy and the brilliant introduction of his seemingly twin brother whose first forays into the art of screenplay writing only depress the creativity within Charlie further. Kaufman writes himself as pathologically insecure, incapable of forming relationships with those around him and traumatically stuck within the story. It takes the pragmatism and confidence of Donald to finally bring the narrative to a form of conclusion which in its absurdity can be seen as nothing short of self-parody. The acting is wonderful. Tight, layered cameos from Tilda Swinton and Brian Cox; a rich, complicated performance from Meryl Streep; a frenetic, insane Chris Cooper and, finally, from Nicolas Cage who, despite the turkeys in his portfolio, gives Charlie and Donald a paranoia and charm that is the centre of the film. Spike Jonze's direction is spot on. There are no tricks or artifice to distract you from Kaufman's spiral of collapse and the time and storyline jumps are seamlessly blended in without looking crunchy. Hilarious at times and yet moving and thoughtful. No-one else could have made the life cycle of an flower let alone an orchid so rewarding."
87,Adaptation.,8,11 August 2014,This movie is pure genius,"Wow, I can't believe it took me 12 years to see this movie.And I only did it already knowing that Susan Orlean did write the essay for The New Yorker and then wrote 'The Orchid Thief' book about about John Laroche. That Charles Kauffman did write 'Being John Malkovich' and were given the task of creating a screenplay for the book. And that Robert McKee is indeed a real person in real life that is very famous for his 'Story Seminar' lectures (by the way, do read him!).This was a stellar portrayal of Charles Kauffman (who is indeed the real screenwriter) by Nicholas Cage, and also playing the fictional twin brother Donald Kauffman (that indeed was given the Oscar along with Charles by the Academy, the first time an Oscar goes to a fictional person).And that ending! Many people seem to not get it at the time, but it was a full blown satire and ironic ending, being the most anti-Hollywood finale by being very hollywoodian. Genius, this is my favorite from Spike Jonze. A must see!"
88,Adaptation.,,1 April 2014,"From the Creator of Being John Malkovich, Comes the Story About the Creator of Being John Malkovich","From the creator of Being John Malkovich, comes the story about the creator of Being John Malkovich. Adaptation chronicles the struggle that screenwriter Charlie Kaufman went through while adapting the book this film was supposed to be based on into a screenplay and also dramatizes the events from the source material. Written by Charlie Kaufman & directed by Spike Jonze, Adaptation is a fresh, imaginative & highly engaging work of originality on the same page as the duo's previous venture together.Do it once & it's a fluke, do it twice & it becomes something else. And that's what both Jonze & Kaufman have pulled off here, with Kaufman coming up with a unique vision & Jonze beautifully realizing it on the film canvas, once again. The plot jumps from one storyline to another within the film but it never becomes too convoluted for viewers to have much difficulty in flowing with it. Kaufman does bring in the events from his own life but it comes with required exaggerations & added fictional elements for cinematic purposes that eventually work in its favour.Coming to the performances, I'm not really a fan of Nicholas Cage but here he delivers a performance that truly deserves all the praise & admiration it garnered whereas both Meryl Streep & Chris Cooper are fabulous in their given roles. On an overall scale, Adaptation is a curious exploration of the creative block that every artist ends up facing at some point of his/her career and also covers the feelings of frustrations, self-doubt & hopelessness which comes with it.One of the most exciting, fun, clever & entertaining works of filmmaking art to surface on the silver screen in the 21st century, Adaptation finds the duo of Charlie Kaufman & Spike Jonze in prime form and is thoroughly recommended to all cinema lovers out there."
89,Adaptation.,9,10 February 2014,Brilliant and wildly entertaining,"Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman. What a brilliant duo. Their films are not only excellent, extremely intelligent and wonderfully well made in all the filmmaking aspect, but also makes the term original looks banal. This, coming in an age where everything is recycled and the word originality itself is rarely used to describe films released in the last 20 years or so. But there is it. Adaptation. The subject may look a bit simple and over used, I mean, it's not really the first time that a film explores the 'Writer's block' subject. A notable example of films with the same theme is the Coen's Barton Fink. So then you ask: what makes Adaptation so unique? Well, Kaufman's imagination simply can't restrain itself to one 'main' theme. That ambition is what makes Adaptation so unique. Despite having an excellent, superb character development, the story isn't only about one character. It's about life. It talks about the concept of creating for art vs 'industry', there is all the problems of this fictional 'Kaufman', and there is even questions about themes in the literature, such as 'putting the artist in it's own work' . There is a similar idea on the book The Picture of Dorian Gray, by the great Oscar Wilde. And I'm not even in the beginning. Is a fascinating film.I don't even praised the excellent performances in the film. Cage, phenomenal. I think it's his greatest performance so far, and totally deserved an Oscar back in 2002. He was indeed great. Meryl Streep was good as always, she looked very comfortable in the role. Chris Cooper was a bit overrated, but he was good regardless. If I had to say everything that I wanted about this film I probably would spent a lot of time, but this is a quick review, so I just want to say...Watch it! 9.8/10"
90,Adaptation.,8,23 January 2014,Charlie Kaufman is damn good screenwriter,"""Adaptation""Let me just say, watching Meryl Streep snort orchid drugs was the best thing ever. Performance (I think I focus more on this or at least give more of an opinion about performances than my respective colleagues i.e. Kole﻿ and Taylor﻿) Where the douche is THAT Nicholas Cage? Why doesn't he do more of this stuff? Freakin ""Ghost Rider"" and ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"", jeez wtf is that. This was very impressive on his part. Meryl Streep is Meryl Streep. I find it difficult to imagine Chris Cooper playing anything other than someone affiliated with the military or a secret agent. Nonetheless, he did well. I mean he won 2003 Best supporting actor so someone really liked him. As far as the script goes. WHAT?! WHAT THE DEUCE? Charlie Kaufman I applaud you. I really do. If this is anything close to the real you then I hope life is better for you. If not, then this is just great story telling. Well done. I'm sure others will disagree but there's no way that ""The Pianist"" should've beat this out for best adapted screenplay. I've seen ""The Pianist"", and it's great an all. But this just literally made my jaw drop again and again. I found myself sitting on the sofa with an awkward face, having to pick up my jaw. So much. That's really all there is to say about it without giving too much away. I like to leave movies as a surprise. It has my stamp of approval though, so watch it when you get the chance.8/10"
91,Adaptation.,7,11 December 2013,An Interesting Movie Based On a True Story: Adaptation,"Adaptation is one of the atypical movies I have ever watched. It is far different than other movies. It is different because you can find many different meanings, if you look at from different perspectives. The film is about screenwriter Charlie Kaufman who is trying to adapt the book 'The Orchid Thief' -which is written by Susan Orlean- to the screen. At the first sight it looks like everything is about adaptation, because the film shows how an orchid adapts to life, how Charlie Kaufman tries to adapt the Hollywood and his girlfriend's sexual desire so we have to look at the theory of adaptation to understand and criticize the movie. However, if you look at the movie from different perspectives, you can see that there is more than mere adaptation. You can see deep social and psychological problems when you compare Charlie Kaufman the character in the movie and real Charlie Kaufman. You can see a conformist society that pushes people to be a part of the system. This society transforms people. On the other hand you can see a man Laroche who is an individual and follows his desires in this conformist society. Susan Orlean and Charlie Kaufman symbolize the people who struggle against being a part of system and who try to survive in a conformist society. Although, at the first sight, it seems the film is about adaptation -considering different types of adaptation (natural adaptation and social adaptation) in the movie-, if you analyze the film deeply, you can see another meaning that shows us the movie is about not adapting to a conformist society, surviving in a conformist society and being an individual by showing us struggle of Charlie Kaufman, Susan Orlean and John Laroche."
92,Adaptation.,8,30 August 2013,Charlie Kaufman has to be one of the most original screenwriters...,"Charlie Kaufman has to be one of the most original screenwriters of the last 10 years. Each of his films contains a completely new idea, from the entry into somebody's mind in 'Being John Malkovich' to travelling through memories in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. 'Adaptation.' is the middle ground between these, combining the surreal absurdity of 'Malkovich' and the drama of 'Sunshine', with fantastic results. It's a hilariously funny and extremely intelligent film about writing a film of an unfilmable book, and the struggles that it causes the main character.The main character is a fictionalised version of the writer himself, and he also has a fictionalised twin brother, Donald, who decides to become a screenwriter too. This allows for a lot of the writer's own thoughts and cynicisms about Hollywood screen writing. When Donald eventually writes a successful screenplay, many ideas of which Charlie has previously shot down, Charlie becomes depressed because he is finding his own screenplay difficult to write. The twin dynamic works really well, especially because it's Nicholas Cage playing off himself, and a lot of really funny moments are created through it. For possibly the first time ever in a film, I really enjoyed Cage's performance, and think he did a fantastic job with the nervousness and awkwardness that the character required.The other part of the film is the story of ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan Orlean, and the fictional romance between her and her redneck subject John Laroche. Meryl Streep plays the character of Orlean really well, and we see her internal struggles clearly throughout. Their relationship is both a bit disgusting, due to the dislikability of Laroche, and really funny because of how different the pair of them are. The best thing about this film is its surreality and self-referencial nature, which works much better here than in 'Malkovich', and many of the best scenes of the film are due to this odd, absurdist view. At one point Charlie thinks ""how did I get to be here"", and we see everything from the dawn of man up to Charlie's birth and beyond.The biggest problem with the film is that occasionally it's too weird, and it's also slightly overlong. It's 110 minutes long, and drags in some places towards the middle. That said, it's definitely worth seeing for anyone with a sense of humour, and the ending is extremely odd and rewarding."
93,Adaptation.,10,17 July 2012,Disappointment,"The first time I saw this film was many years ago - I was much younger then. I remember liking it and, more than anything, wanting to like it. But I also remember that I didn't care much for the ending. I was a bit disappointed.I recently watched Adaptation again and now, nearly 10 years later, I realize that this is a flawless film.As much as this is a film about a writer's struggle through the creative process - inspiration, the lack thereof, internal conflict and self loathing - this is also very much a film about disappointment.The true ending of this film, for me, was that moment in the swamp when Orlean and Laroche cannot find the ""ghost"" orchid. Charlie Kaufman's character says:""That's the end of the book. I wanted to present it simply without big character arcs or sensationalizing the story. I wanted to show flowers as God's miracles. I wanted to show that Orlean never saw the blooming ghost orchid. It was about disappointment.""Sure, life is full of drama, as Bob McKee so passionately reminds us. But for most average people there are no scandalous affairs, suspenseful pursuits or 11th hour epiphanies.Still, too often, such an ending is not satisfactory, not enough for today's audiences who crave sex, drugs and violence and other cheap thrills. Perhaps the reason we love film is because it tells stories that are satisfying and have closure, things we lack and crave in our lives.And so Kauffman offers an alternate ending... and that is all I'm going to say.This film is a triumph for writers, and in many ways a message to Hollywood producers. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years and I assure you, it's better the second time around.So to those who found the ending disappointing...all I ask is that you look a bit closer. The whole story comes together perfectly. It is probably the most beautiful and brilliant script ever written."
94,Adaptation.,10,23 December 2011,"Adaptation. (2002) - Starring the Real Charlie Kaufman, and His Fictional Twin Brother Donald!","Spike Jonze directs the biography of film writer Charlie Kaufman, where some events are maybe true or just written fictionally. Nicolas Cage stars in a double-split role as both Charlie Kaufman, and his twin brother that doesn't exist in real life, Donald. This is might be a true story of how Charlie has been asked to write an adaptation to Susan Orlean's book ""The Orchid Thief"", along with a real character named John Laroche, but has senses of laziness, tantrums, and writer's block. Throughout, he starts trying to learn the secrets behind these human beings. That sounds pretty weird, but it works easily. Nicolas Cage delivers one (or two) of the best performances of his career as both Charlie and his brother Donald. Watching him portray two characters is super genius. The cast is rounded out by Meryl Streep as Susan Orlean, the lonely author of ""The Orchid Thief"", and Chris Cooper in a scene-stealing Oscar-winning performance as the antagonizing John Laroche. Written by the true Charlie Kaufman, and directed wonderfully by Spike Jonze, ""Adaptation"" is a stylish piece of art that brings weird and unexpected material which really works. With a brilliant cast, incredible direction, and a well-written script by the true Kaufman, ""Adaptation"" is easily one of my all-time favorite movies. This is truly original, it feels true, it's straight to the point, it sends a message, and it's just plain entertaining. ""Adaptation"", in my review, ""a visionary portrait, a well-made bio film""."

96,Adaptation.,9,22 August 2010,The Most Original Adaptation Ever,"Adaptation. is the comedy drama from director Spike Jonze and the legendary screenwriters Charlie and Donald Kaufman. It stars Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper (who won an Oscar for the film). The film takes place in modern day New York and Florida.Charlie Kaufman (Cage) is a screenwriter who is trying to adapt a book about flowers and he is finding it very difficult to create a script which makes flowers seem great yet is also a very entertaining film. His agent is breathing down his neck to finish the film while his twin brother Donald is writing a script about a serial killer. The author of the book, Susan Orlean (Streep), is writing an article for the New Yorker which takes place three years earlier than Kaufman's story. She is following John Laroche who is an expert on orchids. The movie is about the adaptation of Laroche's story to an article and book by Orlean, and then to a screenplay by Kaufman.The most fantastic thing about this film is the acting. Cage plays both of the Kaufman brothers and earns an Oscar nomination for his performance. He is excellent at portraying the nervous, awkward, yet incredibly truthful and brilliant Charlie Kaufman, while also being excellent being the confident, likable, and more normal Donald Kaufman. If Cage wasn't up against Brody for The Pianist at the Oscars I believe that he should have won. Streep did a wonderful job portraying Susan Orlean. She was the depressed woman hiding behind a smile and just looking for something that she could be passionate about. She also receive an Oscar nominator for her performance which she did deserve. Chris Cooper won an Oscar for his performance as John Laroche and won it deservingly. He was funny, yet disgusting at the same time. His character had so much depth which he was able to bring out showing that he was not a hick but a real person with passion and all he wants to do is enjoy his life because he went through so much hardship. I would have to say this is the best acted film of 2002 by an ensemble cast.Charlie and Donald Kaufman wrote this unique film and they did so brilliantly. They are the only people who have ever written themselves into the script and made the film actually about them writing the script. Along with that they wrote about the writer of the book Susan Orlean and also made the film about her writing the book. It is a film about people writing a film. What I really enjoyed was how Charlie Kaufman was piecing together the script in the film that he actually chose to do that and I saw it in the film. The writing in the film was just so unique and enchanting, absolutely magnificent.Overall, I give this film a weak 9/10. It was truly great and it is definitely one of the best films of the 2000s. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys unconventional films and great performances."
97,Adaptation.,8,25 February 2010,Flowers in his Attic,"Wildly original is Charlie Kaufman. To date, I've only seen four (ranked from best to still damn good): Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. And as much as I liked Adaptation, it currently ranks as #3 of 4.Does that, ranking Adaptation third of the 4 Kaufman-written movies I've seen, make it any less grand? By no means  it's a great feature. Wonderfully inventive, great acting all around and a story that moves you, interests you and keeps you around to the closing. As great as everyone, including Director Jonze, was (and I'll get to them in a bit,) it's ringleader Kaufman that controls the seas here. Believe me: if I were in Hollywood, I would follow him. Blindly.Screenplay writer Charlie (Cage) is a part of one of his last projects (realistically shown) Being John Malkovich when he's summoned to adapt Susan Orlean's (Streep) novel The Orchid Thief. But he doesn't know how to adapt a movie based on flowers. He seeks out help from his twin while fantasizing about multiple women he masturbates to as he's a lonely soul.His world gets darker by the moment as he tries desperately to solve this dilemma on his own. The movie jumps from present (screenplay adaptation) to a couple of years in the past to explain the story. You're basically seeing his real-life screenplay unfold in his real life as if this is a real life true story.The dialogue, especially between the brothers, is excellent, intriguing and humorous. As is the bond between brothers. In addition, there's drama, suspense, mystery, lust and creativity abound. Cage, who I loved (pretty much only) in Leaving Las Vegas is solid here playing both Kaufman and twin. Streep is wonderful, as usual, but adds more to her résumé as a depressed, lost soul hooked on the plant (literally.) Cooper is superb as ""the smartest man he knows,"" or so he tells us. He's wonderful in his plant-loving role. And I definitely love (much later in Michael Clayton, but I just saw Adaptation for the first time) Tilda Swinton. Too bad she (and Livingston, who I will also favor greatly) isn't in the movie too much. The time she is, is good, however.The movie's weird, by all means, but it shows true escapism, originality and depth. For any struggling writer, in/out of the silver screen, this is the movie for them. Its presence should inspire the weakest of blocked writers. And should show that, if you have an idea, no matter the oddity or cost, explore it. Envision it. Produce it. And get it made, on paper at least. Who knows? Perhaps one day, you can explore your dreams with an audience one day. Or have Brian Cox yell at you until your bones shake."
98,Adaptation.,8,5 January 2010,The Uzis of Madison County,"My entirely subjective view of this film was that Charlie Kaufman was hired to adapt a very worthy, well-written book called The Orchid Thief for the screen and quickly realises that it's another Bridges of Madison County (Meryl Streep plays the author). As such it is really not a great subject for a movie and he is stuck with this albatross of a book. The film then becomes an allegorical version of his efforts to create an adaptation.Due to the strain his (fictitious) brother Donald appears embodying all the commercial aspects of Hollywood film-making. Donald learns screen writing at seminars given by someone who is basically just another money sucking inspirational speaker. As Charlie's antithesis, Donald does what Charlie can't and writes a ludicrous(ly commercial) psychological thriller about a serial killer who turns out to be the detective trying to catch him. Charlie points out that they can't be the same person as they are in different places at the same time but Hollywood doesn't care and buys the script for a million dollars, obviously.The key moment is when Donald meets the author Susan Orlean pretending to be Charlie. Donald suspects something is not right about Susan and The Orchid Thief, John Laroche. This is actually the moment the real Charlie gives in to the fact that he has to do something commercial to spice up the script.What follows is a nicely done Hollywood pastiche of drug addiction, guns, Lousiana swamps, alligator savagery and Charlie effectively killing off the character of Donald in a car crash. Donald has served his purpose as an artistically credible way for Charlie to sell out and he has a decent script. Confused? - well it's all a bit post-modern so it was never going to be simple.Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper are always guaranteed to give great performances and Nicolas Cage does nothing wrong but I think Paul Giamatti would have killed as Charlie. Still, as the writing credit reflects, there have to be compromises to get a film made."
99,Adaptation.,9,25 October 2009,Ouroboros,"#MINOR SPOILERS#To a person who is unacquainted with the history of narrative technique, Adaptation will appear to be a groundbreaking film. The fact that narration can become completely self-referential is certain to seem novel to most film buffs, because movies generally are too popular and expensive a medium to attempt anything that deviates even slightly from the norm.So its not new or original in an artistic sense, but its still a clever movie, and its very well made for the most part. Charlie Kaufmann achieves a number of goals with his script : (1) He successfully articulates the essence of Susan Orlean's book 'The Orchid Thief"". (2) He portrays the writer's (i.e. his own) personal struggle with writing, Hollywood, and life in general. (3) The film's third act is a parody of Hollywood norms, and by logic it is everything that Kaufmann was against.The three above strands of the film are perfectly welded together. Spike Jonze's direction is absolutely faithful to the script (for all practical purposes, Kaufmann IS the director, more like a playwright w.r.t a play). Kaufmann's self-portrait is frighteningly candid. The Donald Kaufmann character is, shockingly, very thinly written, like a joke that gets lame on repetition. Kaufmann might despise his peers, but if he thinks they are as soggy as his ""brother"", then he's terribly in denial. J.J. Abrams and Steve Zailian might be sell-outs, but they are at least as clever as Kaufmann.The androgynous Tilda Swinton looks smoking HAWT here !"
100,Adaptation.,10,12 June 2009,Profound and provocative,"I just viewed this film at our library, where there was a discussion afterward. A couple of my friends found the movie tepid, pointless and boring. They saw it as just talk, no action, no plot....I, on the other hand, was immediately gripped by Charlie Kaufman's conflict, how he was struggling to make a book with no action, as he told McKee ""simply like life"" into a screenplay. Giving Charles a brother who represented another part of him was a brilliant device, with Donald completing his personality. Nicholas Cage managed to differentiate the two persons by just the tone of his voice, avoiding the excesses that would have made this into an parody.If I had to describe the purpose, the message, of this film, it is an exposition of what the American audience will accept in a high budget feature film. It actually was two films, with the break being when McKee told Charlie, ""never never use a Deus ex Machina, a device that does not follow the integrity of character and plot"" That's when the film that had focused on Charlie Kaufman, a real human being, became a film ""by"" Charlie Kaufman with chases, the spying, the sniffing dope, the secret love affairs......all the elements available to the 21st century film industry. The second part of the film was the work of Donald Kaufman.The second part of the film was written for my friends who were bored to tears by the first part....all the talking, the angst, the subtle adaptation between the orchid and its pollinator, driven by a lust that like Donald's, transcended a need for reciprocation.Was the ending a sellout? No, I don't see it that way. Charlie Kaufman didn't have an ending. His characters, because they were real, and fixed in their own world, never did have an affair with each other; they never turned the ghost orchid into a psychedelic drug and they never tried to kill anyone.Charlie Kaufman brought us into his world, one where his goal is not to create art for the few, but entertainment for the masses. But, for my money, he pulled off the impossible, and did both."
101,Adaptation.,10,3 June 2008,Kaufman's Masterpiece,"At first when I rented this movie, I approached it very cynical. I had previously seen ""Being John Malcovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" and I was actually very anxious to see this movie. In the beginning, I was literally saying out loud ""oh, you're just going too far, trying too hard,"" at the evolution of the world scene. Oh well... Not every Kaufman movie can be a mind-blowing masterpiece...Wrong.By the time Donald and Charlie travel down to Florida after Meryll Streep's character, I was finally unaware I was watching a movie. Never before have I felt such an emotional connection to each of the characters in a film. I honestly think this is one of the best-cast movies I have ever seen. Above all, Chris Cooper is unrecognizable as the hick-orchid collector. I had already known of his Oscar win by the time I watched this movie, and as I did, I just assumed he won the Oscar for his comedic and almost caricature-style of portraying real-life Laroche. The car crash scene did it for me. His conviction in his acting, so powerful in that scene, and his wholly convincing relationship to Orlean is just fantastic. Not to spend too much time, although I would LOVE to, Nicholas Cage proved to me he is an amazing actor. I have been skeptical of his other works, but this movie is his tour-de-force. I would argue that this acting is truly amazing and very easily should have won the Oscar that year. (Although Adrian Brody eventually did)Back to the actual story. I remember I was amazed at the intricacy and cutting of the separate stories in each respective time period. I mean, one scene begins with a caption like ""3 years earlier"" and almost immediately cuts again to a scene ""5 years earlier."" Kaufman is just a genius. And the ending... Oh my God... On its own, this ending is cliché, stupid, and very unlikely. But in the context of the story playing out as though Charlie and Donald Kaufman actually wrote it.... I get chills just thinking about it. I seriously loved ""Being John Malcovich,"" but after seeing ""Adaptation.,"" I am curious as to whether or not they hand out the Nobel Prize for Genius. If they do, Charlie Kaufman deserves the first 20.The fact that Kaufman wrote this screenplay (yes, it is actually adapted off of the non-fiction ""The Orchid Thief"" (I'm holding it right now and it looks exactly as it did in the movie! I am actually expecting to see Meryll Streep's picture on the inside cover)) is just amazing. He poured so much of himself into this story I am guessing. Not only that, but the line between reality and fantasy is drawn SO slightly, I'm almost positive that ONLY Charlie Kaufman can understand this story fully and where those boundaries lie.I seriously, seriously HIGHLY recommend this movie! I would argue this is the greatest screenplay written for a movie in 30 years, not only due to its vivid and fantastic story lines and characters, but for its unbelievably unethical approach to portraying movie plot and demonstrating the arch of rising action, climax, and denouement. I actually could have seen this movie ending, fading to black, then we see the real Charlie Kaufman sitting in the audience watching this film - as though this WHOLE time the movie had been what Cage's Kaufman was writing about in the movie.I'm getting mixed up just talking about it! Please, everyone, watch this movie! This movie is highly underrated and definitely deserves to be on the top 250 IMDb list! (However, this movie is more enjoyable if you watch ""Being John Malcovich"" first. Trust me, it'll make much more sense!)A movie masterpiece of acting, writing, and directing. A perfect 10/10. **********/**********"
102,Adaptation.,10,4 May 2008,Absolutely Mind-Blowing!,"Adaptation. is about the never-ending struggle of a screenwriter who must adapt an unconventional novel in to a big studio screenplay. I love this movie because of its flawless fuse of fiction and reality, an impeccable performance by Nicholas Cage, and the excellently executed screenplay written by Charlie Kaufman and his fictitious twin brother Donald.First, Adaptation. is partly a true story. Many of the characters, in the film, are real people. The main character, Charlie Kaufman, also wrote the screenplay. Charlie Kaufman was hired to adapt the novel The Orchid Thief, but instead of a straight story, The Orchid Thief is just a book about flowers. Because of his difficulty, Kaufman decided to record his battle with the book into one of the most original screenplays ever written. The Kaufman in Adaptation., is seen writing about the author, Susan Orlean, and the real orchid thief, John Laroache, but then, later, in the movie, Kaufman is seen telling himself to write himself into the screenplay. The conclusion of the story is also fictional. I am still unsure about what is and what is not fictional. My noggin's throbbing' just thinking about it. Next, Nicholas Cage gives the performance of a lifetime as the troubled Charlie and the callow Donald. Cage plays identical twin brothers, but the viewer is always able to identify which brother is which. Cage depicts Donald as a jubilant man who is confident but not cocky. Donald admires his brother and wants to be a screenwriter, too. He has substantial luck with his first script, which boosts his confidence even more. On the other side of the spectrum is Charlie, a miserable man whose genius on the page doesn't echo into his every day life. He is afraid to make a move for the woman he loves. His lack of confidence turns her to another man, making him even more miserable. Two total opposites that look exactly the same. Every actor plays multiple characters, but to be able to play two different characters in the same frame and to distinctly differ between both is impressive in it's own right. ""You and I share the same DNA. Is there anything more lonely than that?""  Charlie KaufmanFinally, the screenplay, scribed in a joint effort by the Kaufman brothers, is mind- blowing. The fact that so much thought and emotion was hardly hammered into a story makes me feel so distant from my own ambition to become a screenwriter. Even though Donald does not exist outside of the film, it is important that his name is attached to the project. The story changes drastically because Charlie, a writer who tries to remain faithful to the original story while making it intriguing and new, needs assistance from his brother to complete the screenplay. At this point in the film, the real Charlie begins to write the final act as Donald would write it. He adds everything the Charlie in the story wouldn't add; Passionate sex, hard drugs, intense car chases, and violent shoot-outs. All of these are present in Donald's over the top climax. Charlie Kaufman must have felt so good when he thought of this, because it surely made an impression of awe on me.In conclusion, never has there been a movie that impressed me so much. There are many more aspects of this phenomenal film that I have refrained from revealing. Adaptation. is my favorite movie because of the gutsy screenplay, terrific performance, and it's realistic fictional nature. I've said enough. So, what are you still doing reading this? Go get a copy of Adaptation.!"
103,Adaptation.,10,22 February 2008,Unique,"The word ""unique"" is probably the best word that one can use to describe this film in the most simplistic manner, but the truth is that this movie is anything but simplistic, playing one of the most complex screenplays I have ever seen. I don't (personally) know anyone else beside me who would find this film funny, but for me Adaptation's got lots of hum-our, it's got a message, not a beautiful message, but a simple one, a message not meant for the average mall audience( a little bit unbelievable , because it is said out loud by the narrator, so people should really get it). The message of this film is all about life, about passion, about the few, the very rare people understanding one's passion and about the many others that don't understand it. Some people say the ending of this movie is a bit of a letdown, since at one point in the film an authority on screen writing suggests that an exceptional ending is what separates great films from merely good ones, so you're led to expect an extraordinary finale . But people saying that are the ones that missed the point of this movie. Kauffman had a passion. His passion was to make a movie different from the others , a movie different from the Hollywood stereotypes, with no drugs, guns or car chases. He ends the movie exactly the opposite, bringing everything there: the cars, the guns the drugs... So he fails, or, if I may, he doesn't succeed. But that's where he keeps his word. That's where this screenplay turns out to be the best I've ever read. That's exactly what he wanted: to write a story where the hero doesn't succeed in the end.About acting and directing, I have to say that with such a marvelous writing, they had to be perfect. It was impossible for them not to be so. Nicholas Cage plays Kauffman perfectly. Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper are there for the Hollywood experience that you won't forget. The frequent voice-overs used to reveal Charlie's thoughts, a no-no in writing seminar guru Robert McKee's (Brian Cox) book, are perfect. Brian Cox was an excellent guest in this movie, he is exactly what every screenwriter hates: an authority in what you know and what you will let people know.To end this comment, what can I say? Go see it if you haven't yet done so, or if you've seen it and didn't like it, see it again. This is the movie about movies that will forever alter the way you see movies."
104,Adaptation.,9,18 February 2008,"It may not floor you, but the reason is because it's genius","""Adaptation"" will probably leave you disappointed. But, only the shallow or perhaps those who simply dismiss screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's point will think it merely decent or perhaps even bad. ""Adaptation"" is a movie about writing movies, a struggle to discover what has significance and meaning in life.The film stars Nicholas Cage as the film's screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, and his twin brother Donald who seems to be more the alter-ego, the opposing force, the opposite of Charlie. Kaufman takes on the project of adapting a book called ""The Orchid Thief"" for the big screen, only he can't seem to come up with anything - that is until he decides to write himself in the film. In summary, it's a movie about the real Charlie Kaufman telling the story of how he came up with the idea for ""Adaptation"" in his struggles to adapt ""The Orchid Thief"" for the big screen.The story is a lot less surreal than Kaufman's ""Being John Malkovich"" and is a lot more accessible as a result. The character Kaufman's struggles with writing and women are more than relatable, they're distinctly honest and real. The odd relationship between Charlie and Donald is the only strange dynamic, revealing quickly that perhaps Donald is not part of the factual element of the film, that he represents something greater. Cage is perfect for the role. His pathetic neuroticism is essential for the film's effectiveness, but also impressive is Cage's ability to play Donald, someone that feels similar to Charlie yet is distinctly different and namely more confident and care-free. It is easily Cage's best performance, which is not hard to say considering the garbage he's been in.Also wonderful are the supporting roles of Meryl Streep as the author of ""The Orchid Thief"" and Chris Cooper as the subject of the novel, a toothless flower-loving hick. Both actors bring their credentials to the film and are superb. Director Spike Jonze, though not the source of credit in this film, does do an excellent job (like in ""Malkovich"") blending the real and Kaufman's (the character) imagination.Without detailing the films climax towards the end of the film, the bottom line is that Kaufman (the actual screenwriter) has provided a film that highlights the direct conflict between higher art cinema and Hollywood blockbusters. His ending is disappointing so that you might think about which is truly more valuable."
105,Adaptation.,10,12 February 2008,Demystifying the Mystery - Why is Adaptation So Good?,"I have a friend who I respect a great deal and who is also in this group of people. She wanted to know why I would rate the film so highly when I'm clearly not stupid. ""It's amazing and deep,"" I told her. ""Really, how so?"" she asked me. And when I thought about it, I found that though I felt very strongly about my statement, I could not tell her why I felt this way. I decided to watch the film again with this in mind and here is what I discovered The film opens with Charlie asking himself the age-old questions about who he is and why he exists. We're then taken through a few scenes that simultaneously set up Charlie as a man who is clearly a passionate intellectuallyperhaps even a geniusyet thoroughly uncomfortable in his own skin. He's looking not just for his place in the world, but his place within himself. I think that this distinction is key in the film.Charlie is trying to find himself by stretching his creative process through his writing. I don't think that he knows that he's on a personal search in this processhe just knows that he has to reach deep within to create his screenplay or he will not be satisfied. He's scared of this exploration and his fear keeps him from writing what he wants to write, how he wants to write it. This is analogous to his life, where fear is preventing him from doing a number of things. Most importantly, it's preventing him from knowing himself.His fear also comes to light in his dating life. He does not believe that he has worth and therefore he can not see that the woman he is interested in is also interested in him. This is so pronounced to be almost ridiculous as to the audience she is clearly not just fiends but thinks that she is dating him and wants to move the relationship forward.The parallel story of Susan and Laroche is also one of searching. Susan is not happy but does not know it. She realized that she has a lack of passion (as a counter point to Charlie) and discovers that she is not just unhappy but is also full of an undefined want. Laroche is full of passion but is unfulfilled and looks outside of himself for fulfillmentthrowing himself into things to try to develop and understand his passion. His lack of growth is played out metaphorically by leading to his fate at the end of the movie.When I first started looking at Laroche in the context of the film, I felt that he was an underdeveloped (though very fun and funny) character in the face of the other, deeper characters of Susan and Charlie. Upon further inspection I realized that we do get to know him a great deal and that my initial feeling matched one of the main points of the film. I wanted Laroche to learn somethingas characters do in ""Hollywood"" movies. He does not truly learn anything and that leads to his fatewhich is in itself a very Hollywood thing in a very un-Hollywood film.When Susan and Laroche make a dial tone together, they begin to see that they are what they are looking for in each other. Unfortunately Susan just finds something to be passionate about, but does not deal with her desire to be passionate and lack of understanding of passion. She gains an understanding at a terrible price by the end of the film. She does this by only looking outside of herself and not looking inside.Charlie's brother Donald is at the same time someone who Charlie wants to be and someone who he does not want to be. Charlie wants to retain his introspective genius and gain Donald's easy nature. When Charles starts to ask for/accepts Donald's help, Charlie begins to find the things in himself that he's missing. It's less of a journey of discovery and more of a journey of action. The key to this journey of action, however, is that he is open to its lessons due to the great amount of work he's done looking into himself. Once he sees that the journey is about him, he can take its lessons truly to heart.Susan's desire to be a babyto be newrelates to us the seriousness of taking a journey outside of one's self to see inside without a simultaneous and perhaps deeper journey inside.The ""Hollywood"" nature of the film that is not thought of as a ""Hollywood movie"" is genius. Charles breaks all of the rules of writing to create a masterpiece save for oneto find that thing, that conflict, that something that happens. Everything that Charlie does not want in the movie is in the moviebut none of it comes off as being ""Hollywood."" This is masterful. And he uses the character of the screen writing lecturerthe guy who is prepackaging the writing process as though it's a formulato show that it is a formula, but it is one that mixed properly, can produce something that you don't expectsomething that is better and feels different than anything before it, though it still uses all of the things that you're used to and that you expect.So upon this further reflection, I have an answer for my friend. Adaptation is amazing and deep because the journey of personal discovery that's taken in very small but deeply significant steps is seriously touching and important. To realize that these small steps in life can take you such a far distance is a powerful thing. Combining that lesson with the technical excellence used by Spike Jonze with one actor for two roles along with the writing genius of using and calling out all of the things you expect in a ""Hollywood movie"" in this ""art house"" film makes Adaptation an important and soul-stirring movie."
106,Adaptation.,10,1 November 2007,Hollywood Awakes with this,"This movie is a box of mirrors. One intends to further discover Charlie Kaufman's mind, and see a mirror, over a mirror, over a mirror, believing that as we go further through thoughts we are closer to Charlie, the writer and main character. But we don't. Even though, Kauffman doesn't even try to repeat himself, his writing Odyssey is so vastly represented as Nicholas Cage gives one of his uniquely good acting. The cast develops so naturally, Meryl Streep transmiting so good Sadness as Chris Cooper Pride, the screenplay doesn't.This travel that looks for the inner description of a troubled mind spins, although lacking a central structure of action and a knotted development; it goes on a festival of strange, interesting characters. The Writer's imagination, his intelligence becomes his ruin. If you want to see this movie, prepare your mind, adapt your Brain. ""Adaptation"" is a whimsical journey into an incredible mind."
107,Adaptation.,10,6 November 2006,"Unique Movie, Superb Performances","This movie surely gives a new meaning to the word ""unique"" .. Spike Jonze has only directed one movie before ""Being John Malkovich"" which was a very powerful and unique movie but this movie is much better, I believe .. which doesn't mean any of those great movies lacks originality .. each one of them is individual amazing achievement .. I for one, prefer adaptation of its way of being a little ""weird"" movie and the ability to express things aren't usually shown in movies .. at least not the way the movie shows it .. simplicity and depth are a wonderful combination of this movie which not many movies out there have the same combination .. the movie balances the simplicity with the depth in a way that keeps you excited and not bored at the same time .. a very rare number of movies could handle it very well which I may call a unique combination.The acting is amazingly superb by Nicolas Cage which is probably the best in his career .. Nicolas Cage was surely robbed at the night of the Oscars .. it beats his wonderful performance in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" .. Chris Cooper did a very great job and probably the best in his career .. Myrel Streep is good but didn't do anything special.The characters are very well written and acted in general and what makes it a major movie is that little details here and there. It is one of the best in 2002, if not the best already .. wow !! amazing movie. Don't miss it."
108,Adaptation.,8,30 October 2006,Am I wrong?,"OK! I actually purchased this film some time ago without seeing it first(a rare thing for me) on the recommendations of various film magazines,and of course because of Kaufman's and Jones's masterpiece being John Malkovitch. ""But"" I hear you ask ""Why are you only writing about it now?"" Well dear reader,there are in fact 2 reasons.The first one is that I have only just discovered the wonders of ""IMDB""(it now fills up far too much of my waking time)and second,because of the comments about ""the ending"". Before I come to the ending though,I will briefly tell you what I thought of the film. The whole cast (particularly Nic Cage and Nic Cage)was simply wonderful.While I think that everyone expects pitch perfect performances from the likes of Streep and Cooper,I was so surprised at the double whammy of Cage and Cage playing the twin brothers to such a wondrous affect.Never showy in his portrayal of 2 different people,yet always precise in his ability to never leave the audience in any doubt as to which brother we are watching. It was not just one complete performance,but 2. The story was bizarre,and yet plausible,right up until the end.Ah yes....the end..... Now I have read a few comments that have the theory that the Hollywood ending was written because the Author hated Hollywood endings.It is also stated that the author never got is own way,hence the Hollywood ending"" I have a different theory(and please bear in mind that I haven't seen this movies in a while!) The first part of the film featuring Cooper and Streep was written by one brother,the shy intelligent and eloquent brother.....the ""Hollywood ending"" was written by his flash brother,who was already writing the generic screenplay that we have seen several times before. Am I right? Please post messages with your thoughts. One last thing,if nothing else,this movie sticks in your mind,weather you like it or not.A rarity in todays unoriginal market"
109,Adaptation.,7,17 October 2006,I'm At Loss for Words,"Looking at the movie as it is, with its name, and its plot line, it honestly did not do much for me. I was sort of ""forced"" into seeing this movie. But in the end, it did more good than bad, really.Charlie Kaufman's inner thoughts (narrated in parts of the movie, such as at the very beginning) and Susan Orleans' passages from her book hit me quite hard. The screenplay is beautifully written and nothing like I've ever seen before.It's not only about orchids. It's not only about Charlie Kaufman and his boring life. It's much more than that. But you'll have to see the movie for yourself to know what I mean.A review just can't describe this movie."
110,Adaptation.,10,3 June 2006,The Maddening Art Of Adaptation,"Adaptation (2002): Starring Nicholas Cage, Meryl Streep, Chris Cooper, Tilda Swinton, Cara Seymour, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Brian Cox, Ron Livingston. Director Spike Jonze, Screenplay Charlie Kaufman, Donald Kaufman, and Author Susan Orlean.""I will not be forced to apologize for my existence"" ""You are what you love, not what loves you."" The creative forces behind ""Being John Malkovich"" and director Spike Jonze attempt to broaden that film's complexities and intellectual, post-modern, magic realism in this stunning film which is a semi-dark parody of an adaptation and a mirror into the psychological aspects of writing. From the opening shot of a quick time lapse of human evolution to its final shot of flowers opening and closing, it can be rather confusing to some and satire Heaven for others. Actual screenwriters Donald and Charlie Kaufman parody themselves in the superb performance by Nicholas Cage, who plays both brothers. The Kaufman brothers attempt to make it into the movie industry and constantly write and pitch screenplays. But they are radically different types of writers- Donald a sell-out, a writer of mainstream and popular thrillers and Charlie writes more intellectual, artsy films. But the conflict in the movie is not the expected sibling rivalry. On the contrary, both brothers respect each other's art and are friends. The crisis is Charlie's struggle to adapt the creative non-fiction novel ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan Orlean, portrayed by Meryl Streep. As this is an actual novel and author, the film is ultimately a brilliant, artsy satire concerning the creative process and the Hollywood film industry. Meryl Streep is doing a fantastic performance, far different than anything else she's done. As Susan Orlean, she paints a pathetic and moving portrait of a bored, mousy writer and wife but who, upon engaging in an affair with the inspiration for the protagonist in her book La Roche (played by Chris Cooper), becomes a woman who is able to free her mind and live dangerously. She takes drugs and engages in a torrid sexual affair with this red-neck guy who among other vices, has an internet porn business. If you thought Meryl Streep would never do a movie where she takes drugs or has wanton sex, you were wrong. Brian Cox portrays actual screenplay expert Robert McKee in a true-to-life performance. Tilda Swinton (The White Witch in Chronicles of Narnia) is the agent Valeria Thomas, Cara Seymour is violinist Amelia, Charlie's unrequited love interest and Maggie Gyllenhal (Jake Gyllenhal's sister) portrays Donald's girlfriend Caroline. The movie is powerful, especially in its darker latter scenes, which find Donald and Charlie caught in a life-or-death situation once they have discovered Ms. Orlean's affair. The constant use of voice-over, the deconstructionism, the few touches of magic realism, dream sequences and psychology, add a lot of substance to this movie. At times, however, one gets the feeling the film doesn't take make up its mind about what kind of film it is, but ultimately it's a dark comedy. The characters are nuanced and very human, the screenplay is amazing and in fact an example of how to write a screenplay! This film is a definite winner and one of special interest to aspiring screenwriters."
111,Adaptation.,8,4 February 2006,"All the Hallmarks, but falls just short of greatness","Adaptation has all the hallmarks of a great movie, it has a strong cast; all of whom deliver impeccable performances. It has a hugely original story, with a strong and well crafted ending. It has a solid script that is well thought out, and it is superbly directed.Unfortunately, Adaptation falls just short of greatness, and is probably far to easy to hate, due to the films content and pace of delivery. For movie lovers the film has the potential for cult status, but I believe this screenplay is too limited by its own parameters to ever become a classic.In summary this movie was a very brave project to undertake, and it could quite easily have been awful, but thanks to Kaufman's screenplay, Spike Jonze's direction and truly excellent performances from Cage, Cooper and Streep; I'm glad to say that it's a winner.8/10 Definitely not a film for the casual viewer"
112,Adaptation.,9,21 January 2006,the script,"The script is actually much clever than most people realise. The reason the ending is such an overblown Hollywood action film is due to the introduction of Donald Kaufman. Until this point in the film he has been writing his own action film, but when Charlie asks him to help out he helps him write the end of the film in the style he knows.Up until the point where they join forces and head to new york this is most definitely a Charlie Kaufman script. The moment he needs his brothers help to finish the story it becomes a Donald Kaufman script.The genius of it being that in real life Donald Kaufman doesn't exist although Charlie Kaufman does."
113,Adaptation.,7,7 January 2006,I'll never look at orchids the same way again...,"Surreal, absurdly funny and extremely playful movie about the movie business (""Don't call it the industry!""), written and directed with unearthly wizardry by Charlie Kauffman and Spike Jonze. If one is familiar with their work (Being John Malkovich""), this is yet another intellectual tickle! Cage is in superb form as the two scriptwriting twins who are actually writing the script of the movie itself that we're watching, and... aah - just see for yourself! In fact, the whole cast shines, with characters just to die for! While primarily a delight for movie buffs, it's highly unpredictable in a good entertaining sense. It also throws in very touching and philosophical moments in its swirling story. That way it stays clear of drowning in too much eccentric smugness and silliness. I'll probably never look at orchids again without this in mind!7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe"
114,Adaptation.,10,4 January 2006,A luscious act of beauty,"This movie is so good I find it impossible to describe. That's my ADD kicking in I think. Nicholas Cage is a weird and powerful actor whose physical presence can be frightening. Yet he plays a character who is so pathetic and lost and defeated, you wonder how he could psych himself up to get out of bed and boil an egg. This is the power and the beauty of this film. Nicholas Cage thus sets the stage for this excellent foray into meaninglessness, stupidity, beauty, sex, both animal and vegetable, spiritual blindness, greed, lust, dissolution, addiction, sleazy opportunism, and amateur sleuthing. The Whole Enchilada, mis amigos. It is a descent into madness, but also a light-hearted comedy. It is an introduction to the gift and power of writing and a frustrating movie about a stupid toad who never accomplishes anything. Cage plays a screenwriter hired to ADAPT a New Yorker story for the movies. It is unadaptable, or so he thinks. It is a story about orchids, and a sleazy low-down opportunist who uses an obscure Native American tribe, and ecology-law loop-holes to steal plants in plain sight of the authorities. This sleazy botanist, played magnificently by Chris Cooper, wishes to exploit the protected plants for material gain. Cage, is stretched to breaking between the Hollywood glitz of his screenwriter life, the complete failure of his social and sexual life, the allure of the New Yorker writer, played immaculately white and stiff by the gifted actress Meryl Streep, and the sweaty/grungy and gone-to-seed swamp-rat Chris Cooper. Cooper is a man, or almost a man, having been struck down by Fate, and dragged through the mud. He is miraculously alive, but damaged by forces which tear the skin off a man's soul, left raw and toothless and hurting. Cage's character retreats to the clean ivory tower of writing, specifically to Robert Mckee's ""Story Writing Conference"" in New York City. He, Cage, finds a way to resolve his conflict about life, but a whole lot of struggling characters-he himself, his brother ""Donald"", and others have to suffer. Only the orchids survive, untouched and lovely. Orchids have been through this all before you know. In sum, this is a movie about writing movies. It is a grueling comedy. It is a magnificent piece of work. As I said it is indescribable."
115,Adaptation.,,8 November 2003,Getting away with it,"Basically, this movie is a bit like reading a book. In the book, the writer is telling you about the problems he had writing the book and the internal struggles to get it done. It basically is a lost case, the book, so you mainly read along to find out how it will be dealt with.It's not. As was expected, some 'tricks' are deployed to give the book some more 'body'. So it leaves you puzzled. Were you cheated now? Or not?Movie-wise, Cage is great. So is Cooper. The whole movie rocks and rolls. No boredom there. But at some point the wondering enters. Are we being cheated now? Or not? I say we are. But they are getting away with it. Gracefully."
116,Adaptation.,,24 September 2003,The film that made me respect Nicholas Cage again...,"Another unique story from real life writer Charlie Kauffman, his latest effort is very clever, and very funny. The cast of characters is most likely the strongest of any film this year, with Nicolas Cage brilliantly playing both Charlie and his idiot twin brother Donald. Strong support comes from Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper in Oscar winning form. Cooper 's character wreaks charisma that has not been witnessed since Tyler Durden in Fight Club, and has some of the funniest lines ever expressed by an Orchid hunter, or any I know. The two brothers Cage plays have such contrasting personalities and yet we care about both of them. The story follows Charlie's struggle to adapt Streep's book, ' The Orchid Thief ' centered around Cooper, into a screenplay. Filled with flashbacks within flashbacks, the humour is a sharp as it comes. Examples being Charlie's decision to write himself into his own script (something actually done by the real life Kauffman) which he describes as 'pathetic and self indulgent', and the absurd story suggested by his brother Donald - ' it turns out the killer has multiple personality disorder, and the girl, the cop and him are the same person'. Charlie even visits screenplay guru Robert Mckee who advises him to not use voice -over (something which is commonly done at the start of the film), have a great ending and don't dare put in a deus ex machina. Needless to say, Adaptation turns from a deep insight into a writer's struggle to express himself to a surreal thriller, complete with guns and car crashes. There's even a amusing deus ex machina in the form of a crocodile. Despite boasting one of the most impressive screenplays of recent years, the central theme is not explored enough through all of the central characters and it isn't as impressive or entertaining on second viewing (Meryl Streep's monologue focusing on the problems of adapting can soon become tedious). The script can also be considered too smart to attract a mainstream audience."
117,Adaptation.,8,6 August 2003,A Multi-Layered Gem,"This movie has so many layers in it, so many wonderful and juicy ways in which the word ""adaptation"" is made to work, that even without the brilliance of Nicholas Cage, it would have been at least compelling. With Cage's masterful dual-role performance, this movie borders on a must-see.Cage plays twin screenwriters who are as opposite as possible. I've always considered that to be an acid test of an actor's ability because to maintain both personalilties through the grueling process of rehearsing and filming a movie takes a kind of focus and power lacking in 99% of those who pursue the profession. Cage excels.The plot twists, the character development, and even the settings (the Everglades scenes in particular) are exquisite. And the time-lapse and other ""art"" cinema that Director Spike Jonze weaves into the film are masterful both in their content and in their integration into the story lines.Meryl Streep evolves a bit unevenly and her ultimate destination lacks credence, but her acting is, as usual, quite strong. Chris Cooper, on the other hand, is pure genius in a role that would have been terribly easy to over-act."
118,Adaptation.,,30 July 2003,Key lime pie scene,Amazing movie but one question: Why did the waitress get so freaked out when Charlie invited her to that orchid convention? She looked terrified and she couldn't just say no to him? I mean she did treat him like he was her favorite customer. That was weird for me.
119,Adaptation.,,8 July 2003,The Garden Weasled!,"How sad.  The movie bloomed when we were showed the orchids and their history along with the quests or the plight of all the collectors.  Then the film became a weed.More time could have been spent on the misfortune of early collectors, on the fascination of the flowers, flower shows, Seminoles, swamps by people possessing the passion of the Orchid thief.  The part with the bee ""making love"" to a flower in its image was very cool as well as the part about the Darwin's Moth.LaRouche was great as well but Charles should have kept himself out of the garden as his writers block left him putting everything he did want to put in a movie into his screenplay.Wasted opportunity for what could have been a very unique film.  Too bad as he said he wanted a movie about flowers.  He had the right idea."
120,Adaptation.,5,30 June 2003,sophomoric slouch,"Ah, Spike Jonze...the kid who once directed music videos for Weezer...and became the critics' darling with ""Being John Malkovich,"" is now in the safe zone to deliver ""Adaptation,"" a substandard film that, predictably, got some of the most glowing reviews of 2002.  For all the hype, it's a remarkably average production, filled with huge distractions in the form of Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper, whose subplot and characters (and their resulting romance) are bland and unconvincing throughout--every time the movie cut away to this duo, it smacked into a brick wall.  On the other hand, Nicolas Cage (cast as twin brothers Charlie and Donald Kaufman) gives his best performance in many years, the dual role giving him free reign to play a self-loathing loser and an over-confident himbo; his voice-over narration is some of the funniest I've heard since ""The Rules of Attraction.""  Brian Cox shows up near the end to steal a few scenes as a vulgar screenwriter heading a weekend workshop.  To its credit, ""Adaptation"" has a respectable buildup for the first 1 1/2 acts, then collapses when Streep and Cooper are snorting some coke-substitute and chasing after Charlie in a swamp--if this was a send-up of convention, it certainly didn't work.  But, this type of sophomoric ridiculousness is safe to pull off if you are a critics' darling being hailed for your ""unique vision.""  Spare me.5/10"
121,Adaptation.,9,30 June 2003,Nicolas Cage is an actor !,"I mean, until the moment I saw this movie, I thought he was only the big muscle guy who's making Con Air that... uh... dull.In this movie, he's the absolute opposite : he's a bald fat and intellectual loser who dictates his twin brother the way he should not write a scenario.Even the other characters are likeable and delicious : first idealized by NC, they slowly reveal their nasty, nmaughty and dirty personalities, for our greatest pleasure.Definitely worth a watch but not easily DVDable : there are too many surprises to make this (excellent) movie worth a second watch."
122,Adaptation.,,11 June 2003,"Brought to you by the ""Being John Malkovich"" team.","I like to watch movies without preparation, just see what unfolds, so I didn't read anything about ADAPTATION before I saw the DVD this week, except to know that it is highly rated and has good performances. I now wish I had known it was made by the same team that did BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, because that would have helped me ""get into"" this film's mood a bit earlier.  While I enjoyed it very much, I found it somewhat overall less satisfying that MALKOVICH, mainly because I enjoyed the novelty of the fantasy theme of that earlier movie. Still, as certainly the most completely self-referential film I have seen, a story about the screenwriter coming up with the film we are actually viewing, I liked everything but the developments in the final third of the movie.SPOILERS follow, please stop and think deeply about the consequences before you read further, my friend.Charlie Kaufman is a real person, the real sceenwriter of MALKOVICH and of this movie, ADAPTATION. As the film begins we hear him (Nic Cage) degrading himself, obviously lacking confidence that he can convert this real book, THE ORCHID THIEF, written by a real person, Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep), into a viable screenplay. The central character of the book is played by Chris Cooper (of Lone Star and American Beauty fame). Charlie has an identical twin brother (also Cage) who aspires to be a screenwriter, has a somewhat different personality as Charlie, and eventually his different approach inspires Charlie to write the film that we are actually watching.
SPOILERS continue. My problem with the film started when Orlean decided that Charlie knew too much and he had to be killed. Scenes followed where Charlie is taken to a Florida swamp to be dumped, while his brother (unknown to the others) follow them, they hide overnight, alligators get in the act, a car wreck kills the twin brother, in essence a very ""over the top"" ending to the story. All of that is in response to the advice from a veteran screenwriter who says, ""don't do voice-overs, don't have gunfights and car crashes"", and of course everything is resolved that way. I enjoyed the story, I didn't like the resolution, but overall it was a good movie-watching experience. Nic Cage's roles, playing two similar but different brothers, were outstanding, as was Chris Cooper. Streep is always superb.
While the DVD picture and sound were first-rate (two car crash scenes were very realistic!), there are no extras which is a big disappointment. It would have been very entertaining to see and hear the real protagonists talk about the film vs real life, for example."
123,Adaptation.,6,21 May 2003,Kaufmans admit that they are bad screen writers,"In Adaptation the Kaufmans admit that they are bad screen writers. Apparently, no one believes them, but Adaptation demonstrates persuasively the truth of their confession. Unfortunately Nicolas Cage lacks the imagination necessary to communicate the depth of their insufficiency, his determined physical performances suggest just how confused he must have felt. I am, however, sufficiently convinced the Emperors have no clothes."
124,Adaptation.,,18 February 2003,"""Adaptation"" is a Variation on (or a Rip-off of) ""True West""","I enjoyed this film.  I enjoyed its originality of execution, as well as its thematic obsession with originality itself.  I also enjoyed the performances.  But one thing that bothered me, and no one else seems to have noticed, is its resemblance to Sam Shepherd's ""True West,"" the 1980 stage play, turned into a 1984 TV production starring Gary Sinise and, ironically, John Malkovich who also appears briefly in this film (though, in a sense, in his own eponymous film, of which he weirdly plays the director). 
In both ""Adaptation"" and ""True West"" the story line involves two brothers, the first a successful screen writer embarked on a new project but now suffering from a debilitating case of writer's block, and the second, recently arrived for a stay with the first, who eventually begins working on a screenplay of his own, finishing it with the grudging help of his brother. Even though the second brother's script sounds ridiculous and hackneyed to our ears and to those of the first brother, it is generously praised by a third party who represents the film industry's ignorant bureaucracy (the producer in ""True West,"" the young studio boss in ""Adaptation""), who both suggest that the second, greenhorn brother should now help the first.  In both films the second brother becomes a kind of ""doppelganger"" of the first, a Mr. Hyde to the latter's Dr. Jekyll, and so it is not difficult to view these men as two sides of the same personality, which in ""Adaptation"" is one of the plot devices of second-brother Donald's script.  All the major characters are in essence the same person because, although they may exist in the larger reality, they are all constructions (and reductions) of the author, including ""Charlie"" himself.  And so we are to conclude that all writing is autobiographical (as much as we try to make it something else, something more), and the act of story-telling (i.e., movie-making) becomes a solipsistic enterprise shrinking the world into something that reflects nothing more than one's own neurotic self.  In neither film does it come as a surprise that reality begins to parody the written script, which has never been anything more than an insufficiently digested version of a richer, more elusive Reality (like the rare ghost orchid).  This is underscored in ""Adaptation"" when the story ends so artificially and so happily, in all its Hollywoodian glory, contrary to all the all the events and all the agony that have led to it, including the ruination of the career of a fictionalized Susan Orlean and the deaths of both a fictionalized Donald and a fictionalized Laroche, the orchid man. Laroche is attacked by an alligator at just the right moment, a ""deus ex machina"" if there ever was one; and this, of course, is a slap in the face of the tormented ex-screenwriter McKee, but it is also a vindication of him because it helps us see how Charlie has sold out to the ""formula.""   We notice this also in Valerie and Charlie's mutual confession of love, tidy and cute from a screenwriter's perspective, but too unbelievably pat from ours.  These incidents can only make sense if we view all the trashed and co-opted characters as shriveled parts of Charlie's personality, whom he will now conveniently dispense with, just as Donald might have done, in order to get on with his comfortable career.   In ""True West,"" Austin, the bother who is equivalent to Charlie in ""Adaptation,"" at one point laments, ""There's nothin' real down here!  Least of all me!"" --an understandable observation when, although neither nature nor the human personality operates according to uniformly predictable laws, the characters in a Hollywood movie sometimes do.  Charlie Kaufman could just as well have said this.  But, in attempting to control the uncontrollable by putting himself in his own story, the ""Charlie"" he lets us see becomes as phony as everything else.  Like ""Being John Malkovich,"" this is a movie that made me think -- maybe even more than ""True West"" did.  I just wonder, though, whether Shepherd shouldn't sue for plagiarism."
125,Adaptation.,5,27 January 2003,"It was interesting, avante garde and thoroughly unlikeable.","How much can I say? I'm resentful that I lost two hours of my life for this film that oppressed me with the portrayal of the main character's neuroses. Nicholas Cage did a bang up job portraying a Loser. Enough to make me want to scream.This film is certainly for a cinema buff,  and I will be quite honest and say I like a film that makes me laugh or that I ""enjoy"" watching. I suppose the film was entertaining (it passed time), but it was not my sort of entertainment.If you loved _Vanilla Sky_, this is probably a film you'll at least like."
126,Adaptation.,10,22 January 2003,Best Picture of 2002,"I love movies.  I go to a lot of movies.  I like a lot of different kinds of movies.  Every once in awhile, I will go to the theater and love every second of a movie so much that I don't want to leave, I just want the movie to keep going, for the characters to keep talking.  This is a very rare feeling.  Pulp Fiction was a movie like that for me.  Adaptation is a movie like that.What a film!  Nicolas Cage,  Meryl Streep, Chris Cooper were all brilliant.  Spike Jonze was on point.  But the star is Charlie Kaufman. There are plenty of directors whose movies I will go sight unseen, but I think Kaufman is the first writer that I will see sight unseen from here on out (confessions of a dangerous mind here i come).  simply brilliant.If you liked Being John Malkovich, you will love this.  It is a tad off center, which is one of the reasons why it is great, so I cannot recommend it to everyone.  If you went to see Kangaroo Jack this weekend, don't bother with Adaptation.   ps - why would anyone go see kangaroo jack?"
127,Adaptation.,,21 January 2003,"confusing, but in a good way","Adaptation is a nonlinear metamovie that blends fact, fiction, and even factual fiction to create a new kind of film experience that I fear the average audience member might not be ready for.  Screenwriter/main character Kaufmann is an idealist always looking to be original, unlike his dim but well-meaning twin brother Donald.  When Charlie gleefully attaches himself to adapt a non-fiction book about flowers (""No one's ever done a book about flowers!"" he says), he quickly finds that the challenge is too great.  So as a twist, he writes himself into the movie (which we, the audience are watching) and even gives himself the aforementioned twin brother as a foil device.(Spoilers) Part of the problem people seem to have with this movie stems from confusion over what it is the story is about.  Once Charlie decides to write himself into the movie, the Orchid Thief storyline immediately becomes subplot.  ""They only thing I'm qualified to write about is me,"" Charlie reasons.  People are upset with how Charlie and Donald are saved in the swamp.  This is not a cop-out ending, as others have suggested.  This is Charlie copping-out.  This is a writer going against his ideals because he can't write a movie about this book.  Anyone who doesn't get the comedic irony of this scene needed to pay more attention to Charlie's barroom conversation with McKee.  ""Don't even think of using a deux machina,"" he says. How Charlie gets away doesn't matter because that part of the story is subplot.  It's the same significance as Meryl Streep suddenly turning into a drug addict and murderer.  It's intentionally ridiculous.  Sadly, this movie gives a lot of viewers the ""Truman Show"" vibe for an ending.  I'm guessing that the people who didn't like the way this movie ended are the same who wanted to know what happened to Truman after he escaped.  Watch it again. And again, until you get it.  It's worth it."
128,Adaptation.,,25 January 2003,One of the best films of the year,"It's refreshing to see a film like this after such a disappointing year in movies. An excellent, involving plot, superb acting on the part of the entire cast and an all-around impressive production, Charlie Kaufman's screenplay ""Adaptation"" is, by far, one of, if not the best film of 2002.I was a tad skeptical when I went to see this movie, unsure of what Nicholas Cage would do with the leading role of Charlie Kauffman. God knows he's given us reason to doubt him in the past with films like ""Gone in 60 seconds"" and ""Con Air"", but he has redeemed himself in my book. It's hard to believe it's actually him at some points, which is fairly rare nowadays.The screenplay is one of the most impressively crafted works I have ever seen. It is pretty much beyond explanation. If I had to compare it to something, I'd have to say an onion. This film has so many layers, from the basic story and development of the characters, the influences of the book, ""The Orchid Thief"", the script that Charlie Kauffman (N. Cage Kauffman) is writing, the script the real Charlie Kauffman is writing and all of the plot twists added in to give you a sense of Kauffman as the puppeteer of the entire production. Fantastic. I strongly recommend it to any avid movie fans. In my book, an easy 8.5/10."
129,Adaptation.,8,25 January 2003,Brilliant!,"(8 out of 10)  I was watching a TV reviewer, who said 'Adaptation' is even harder to follow than 'Being John Malkovich'.  Not true!  'Being John Malkovich' went way out on a limb to the furthest reaches of the bizarre. As strange as 'Adaptation' might be, it could all have possibly happened!Remember how after Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' came out, there were numerous copycats?  Well, 'Adaptation' is so audacious, I could totally picture future screenplays inserting the writer into the film, and other similar rip-offs.  This is a true original, but it would be easy to do a knock-off of it.Charlie Kaufman, who did the brilliant 'Being John Malkovich', surpasses himself here.  Why?  Because with 'Malkovich', it probably became easier as the script went along to keep throwing weird stuff in.  But with 'Adaptation', you had so many disparate elements that seemed farout, and yet came together at the end to somehow make sense.  This couldn't have been easy, and from what I've read, it wasn't for Kaufman.  Instead of watching a film-within-a-film, we're watching a psyche-within-a-film-within-a-film.  As Steven Spielberg said upon accepting his Oscar, it's all about the writing. This movie proves it. Certainly Charlie and 'Donald' Kaufman will be up for screenwriting Oscars. If Charlie wins, he'll have a very clever reason for why his 'brother' doesn't show up to accept with him; just see the film!Chris Cooper and Meryl Streep are outstanding, and this is easily Cooper's best-ever performance.  Nicolas Cage gives his second-best ever performance, after 'Leaving Las Vegas'.Kudos to Susan Orlean, who had no idea her bestseller, 'The Orchid Thief', would turn into something so strange, but is okay with the finished product.But the man of the hour is Charlie Kaufman, who is in real life a shy, nervous, brilliant writer.  He put himself on the page, which was very brave.  Hopefully he never repeats himself, and no one copies him.A movie not for everyone, but a must-see for those who love challenging films, and appreciate all that goes into writing them."
130,Adaptation.,10,19 January 2003,"Adaptation is a great, funny, clever movie.","The good thing about Adaptation is how funny it is, and clever, but also...
The Beatles said that the love you take is equal to the love you make, or the other way around, which implies that there is equality which there NEVER or almost never is.The thing in Adaptation is Donald says what or who you love is what matters, not what or who loves you. And that is profound, because the tendency is for people to try and make it all equal up. I give you three jellybeans, so you have to give me three gummy bears.But really in life you can't worry about who gives you what. Or you will never love anyone or anything. So who or what you love is what defines you, and the depth and endurance of your love. Whether or not you receive any (never mind equal) love in return is beside the point. That is why I love this movie."
131,Adaptation.,10,17 January 2003,"Truly phenomenal script, an acting tour-de-force","This finally opened in my town tonight, and WOW!Everyone's going to talk about the script, of course, but what truly blew me away were the performances. Nicolas Cage is FINALLY really acting again, as in his fearless ""Raising Arizona"" days, but this is the most TRULY fearless, vanity-be-damned performances I can recall by an actor in years. He's just incredible as the ""Kaufman twins""--seriously, this puts his Oscar-winning turn in ""Vegas"" (as in ""Leaving Las..."", of course, not ""Honeymoon in..."") to shame. If he's not nominated, it will be a crime.Just as worthy: The always-incredible Meryl Streep, who once again proves she can take on damn near any kind of character and still be unforgettable. She also goes balls-to-the-wall as the fictionalized Susan Orlean, as does Chris Cooper as the teeth-challenged, meta-idiot savant John Laroche. Never do they come off as the spoofy caricatures they so easily could have become.Much of the credit for that, of course, has to be bestowed on the person who probably will be most overlooked given (the real) Kaufman's insanely cool script and the killer cast.That's director Spike Jonze, who--just as he did with Kaufman's ""Being John Malkovich""--never lets the outrageous material play as spoofy or silly. He has real care and concern for the most outlandish of characters, even the (entirely fictional) twin brother Donald, and the viewer likely will be at how many truly thoughtful and emotionally touching moments he allows for along the way.Many reviews of this film to date, positive, negative and in-between, almost make it sound campy--especially the outlandish twists in the ""denooeyment,"", as Donald calls it. But as Jonze directs them, they are the farthest thing from campy. If anything, he's taken his ""Malkovich"" angle--a virtually deadpan, entirely reverent approach to a massively off-the-wall narrative--and INCREASED the levels of gravity and careful consideration with this story.And it all works beautifully, so much that in reflection, one recalls the elements of the film that illustrated the human condition perhaps even more than the gut-busting humor. And don't be misled--the movie also is REALLY funny, certainly more so than ""Malkovich,"" while somehow also not playing like a comedy at all.Looking for a challenge? How about some of the best, most courageous performances of the year? Go expecting a wacky comedy (as some goobers wished of ""Malkovich""--""I hated that movie,"" a boneheaded chain-restaurant server actually told me earlier this evening) and you'll be massively disappointed. And thank heaven for that.Just one more time: Everyone's great, but Cage hits it WAAAY out of the park. This even makes up for playing the guy you just really wanted to strangle in ""Peggy Sue Got Married."" He's simply awesome in this, from allowing himself to look and act simply awful (slouching--as Charlie--to hunchback-like angles, lots of hair added to torso, lots subtracted from crown of head) to making us care deeply for each of the characters he plays.Oscar nominations are deserved all around. Belying its whacked-out premise, this is no lark. It's unforgettable."
132,Adaptation.,,13 January 2003,Wildly Entertaining,"From the minds that brought us into the mind of John Malkovich in the fantastically absurdly ""Being John Malkovich"" warp reality with even more zeal in the perplexing, and yet entirely enjoyable ""Adaptation.""First off, Adaptation is based on a real book, ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan Orlean, which chronicles the exploits of John Laroche, a real southerner who finds and exploits every loophole possible to take orchids from their native wildlife preserve. The downside of this book, I surmise, is it tells a lot about flowers, and not so much about people or events.So when screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, the same screenwriter who penned ""Malkovich"" tries to adapt ""The Orchid Thief"" into a movie, he hits a few roadblocks.  Here's where the movie gets weird. Because it's not only the story of Laroche, its also the story of how Susan Orlean came to write about him, and how much trouble Kaufman has adapting it into the movie we're watching.These three levels, inexplicably, play out completely cohesively. We're never confused or lost, just in awe and a little uneasy of what this mess could possibly lead to.The movie is packed to the gills with outstanding performances. Chris Cooper and Meryl Steep play Laroche and Orlean with spot on perfection. It's a departure for both, I think, playing these somewhat tragic characters with such whimsy. Laroche is depicted as the most intelligent, yet completely deplorable red neck since the kid on the porch in ""Deliverance,"" but he does so with a kind of frantic glee. Streep, as the New York journalist whose bored with her marriage and her shallow elitist friends, finds an odd solace in the company of Laroche, whose joyous obsessions keep him distracted from his own sadness.On the flip side of the movie, we have Nicolas Cage, performing in two of his best roles ever. He plays both Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman, completely identical twins with completely different outlooks on life. Charlie has made his career as screenwriter, believing in the artistic quality of film and its ability to explore the varied facets of humanity. Donald, knowing his brother has a reputable name, wants nothing more than a fast paced potboiler, a script that will sell big and win big in the most cheesy and predictable way.What I found amazing about Cage's portrayal of the twins was how they were physically indiscernible, identical in every detail. But you always knew which was Charlie and which was Donald by how they talked, how they held themselves physically.The finale of this film, which I choose not to divulge here, had me in stitches, although it wasn't particularly funny. It was all an exercise in style, perhaps, because the final product, the movie called ""Adaptation"" is a little bit Orlean's intention, a little bit Kaufman's frustrations. It is a little bit Charlie, and a little bit Donald. Maybe a little confusing, but it never fails at being entertaining.Cheers,Jon"
133,Adaptation.,,2 September 2003,M.C. Escher would be proud of this film.,"Like an M.C. Escher work of art, _Adaptation_ cannot be summarized in terms of the *contents* of the story elements, such as plot, theme, character development. Instead, can only be summarized as the dramatizing of the relationship between screen-writer and movie-watcher. Just like a classic Escher, the elements and structure of screenwriting are themselves the elements and structure thematically explored in the film. Specifics of theme, plot, character development, while intriguing in their own right, are no more important, yet no less attractive, to the film than the subject of Reptiles in Escher's _Reptiles_.If you liked _Being John Malkovich_ or love movies or appreciate Escher, you'll love Adaptation."
134,Adaptation.,10,28 December 2002,Hilarious Ending,"Warning: this review does discuss the ending of the movie, although I'll try to keep it vague enough not to disappoint anyone who hasn't seen it yet. I loved this movie from start to finish! It was the funniest and most thoughtful film that I've seen in a long time. When the film took a turn towards the sensational at the end, I was at first worried that now that Donald had taken over the script everything that I had been enjoying about the movie was over. But then I realized that just as in Donald's _The 3_, the characters at the end of the movie were expressing what was going on inside Charlie -- and it was still both hilarious and human and to my mind very interesting. I wanted to watch this movie again as soon as it was over. It was deliciousmind-candy."
135,Adaptation.,6,9 December 2002,Truly great...  Until the end,"""Adaptation"" was a beautiful, moving film that goes awry in the last 20 minutes.I know that Jonze and Kaufman like to shock audiences, but the way in which they decided to conclude this film was disappointing.Please see the film.  It's wonderfully crafted and the performances are exceptional.  Take special note of Cage's performance.  Streep proved magnificent in an understated way.  Chris Cooper is one of the finest actors working today.But, on a whole, the third act destroys this film.  The irony is that the third act becomes everything that Charlie Kaufman despises about the movies."
136,Adaptation.,1,2 October 2004,The worst movie I ever seen!,"I found out IMDb.com to be a good predictor, with its scores for the movies, for the quality or the level of entertainment a movie can provide. Initially, I thought that the masses would vote better more commercial movies, and the more stupid the movie the better its rank (compare ""Mission Impossible II"" with ""What Women Want"" in terms of sales, for example). In time, and looking at the overall tops, I have seen a good correlation between my taste of an entertaining movie and the IMDb score.This is why we wanted to see Adaptation. It had a good score and we like Nicholas Cage.But it turned out to be an awful movie. Although Nicolas Cage acted very good, during the movie, neither I nor my wife could tell if the twin brother is real or only the fruit of the imagination of a lonely, mentally sick individual.We saw the movie until the end waiting something interesting to happen and everything to change in a brilliant idea. But nothing has happened! It only revealed the onanistic misery of Charlie Kaufman (the personage).The flowers were really beautiful, as well as the nipples of the young waitress acted by Judy Greer (I think). But this would not justify the time and money!If you want to see a really good movie of Charlie Kaufman, go for the excellent ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"".I will read the comments of the movies after the initial screening of the score. Although I may loose some of the first sight impact."
137,Adaptation.,5,10 August 2003,Intriguing concept for what is eventually a shallow conceit,"The writing of a screenplay based upon another medium--in this case, a batch of melancholy ideas stretched into a novel, which the screenwriter finds increasingly difficult to turn into a movie. Terrific and clever passages cannot disguise the fact this film is an in-jokey flurry of ideas itself, with Nicolas Cage sweating it out in a dual role (Cage has wonderful, isolated moments of truth in both performances, but less of him amounts to more). Meryl Streep is effortless as a writer and young Judy Greer is appealing as an orchid-happy waitress, but too much of ""Adaptation"" strikes smug and phony chords. It's a misfire from director Spike Jonze, albeit an interesting one. ** from ****"
138,Adaptation.,,13 January 2005,My brief review of the film,"A unique outlook on the process of and stresses that come with screen writing, the film manages to slip wit and humour in here and there without distracting the viewer from the protagonist's strife. The screenplay, based on some of Kaufman's real experiences, is interesting and quite strikingly original. The film does however become increasingly overdone and silly towards the end, but for the most part it is an original, interesting, albeit not very amazing, film. After writing a fictitious twin brother into the film, Kaufman was able to, within WGA regulations, give half of the screen writing credit to this part of his imagination!"
139,Adaptation.,1,2 June 2004,Seeing it how it is,"This is a combination of distinctly different movies. One is the movie the actors were making, another two are the ones the writers were making, and there's also the one the director was making. It is such a shame that none of these movies ever had anything in common.This film has no hidden redemption but one thing of quality does stand proud of all other components and that is the job Chris Cooper does. He presents a depth of character which seems out of place amongst his peers and does so from an utterly flat and lifeless script. He achieves this with a seeming lack of effort which only demonstrates his true talent and ability.The one credit that should be given to the 'writer' is that he satisfied an edict of script writing: 'Write what you know'. However, in doing so he has undoubtedly shown us that he knows nothing. He has not used some clever device to extract himself from the dull corner he wrote himself into but has blatantly shown that he cannot write. He was being honest in his lack of skill and it has been taken by critics to be some satirical in-joke.The director, well, suffice it to say the he should return to his staple work where his attention span is best suited.This film turns out to be a whole that is far less than the sum of its parts."
140,Adaptation.,2,7 April 2004,Pretty lame,"I remember when I was 8 my family was staying in a hotel room in palm springs. to conserve space the bathroom sink was in a kind of hallway, across from which was a closet. This closet, for the sake of ambience had mirrored doors. Opposite the closet was the bathroom mirror. I remember I spent a good 15 minutes, playing in the hallway, jumping around waveing my arms. I was fascinated by the image within an image that the mirrors created together.
I was 8, and that entertained me for 15 minutesI'm now 20, and this movie lasted 1 hour 54 minutes, and had the same basic attraction to it.One amusing little gimmick does not make a good movie, am I supposed to feel it's terribly clever that he invoked a Deus Ex Machina (aligator) after Brian Cox forbade it?
If you'll permit me to flash back to my child hood once more;I can remember taking a theatre class in junior high. Our teacher split us into groups, and sent us off, with the task of coming back with our own skit at the end of the hour. Two groups didn't know what to do, so they decided it would be clever to make their skit about students who had to make a skit and didn't know what to do. We all rolled our eyes profusly, and the teacher told them that if they ever did another ""cop out"" like that again they'd fail. Yet somehow a professional writer can pull this crap and be commended for it?Pretty lame.Can I get an amen?"
141,Adaptation.,6,24 December 2002,"Clever film ultimately just clever, not good","""Being John Malkovich"" was one of my favorite films of the past few years, so it should go without saying that I have been looking forward to ""Adaptation"" ever since I heard about it three months ago.  The re-teaming of director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman sounded like movie heaven.  I couldn't wait.How surprised I was, then, when ""Adaptation"" unspooled before my eyes, and the nicest phrase I can use to describe it is ""borderline insufferable."" To call this film a mess is an understatement.  There was something whimsical about ""Malkovich,"" the way Jonze and Kaufman played the material straight, as if the idea of a portal into someone's head was not only completely feasible but somehow quaint.  They didn't lay the jokes on thick; they let the material speak for itself. ""Adaptation,"" on the other hand, feels like it's jabbing you in the ribs every two minutes, saying, ""Look, isn't this clever?!""  Yes, it is clever, I'll agree.  But I can decide for myself the originality and uniqueness of a movie without the filmmakers blatantly telling me again and again.I want to highlight the greatness of the acting on display here, as Meryl Streep gives one of her most laidback performances in years, and it's a joy to watch.  Nicolas Cage is equally good as twin brothers Charlie and Donald Kaufman, with the actor's miraculous ability to somehow convey the subtle nuances and differences between these two brothers without so much as special make-up or outfits to signify their true indentities.  And Chris Cooper is dependable as ever.And yet, there are no real characters here to speak of.  Cage, Cooper and especially Streep seem like nothing more than mouthpieces for screenwrtier Kaufman's insecurities and self-esteem issues.  Cage's voice-over narration is especially grating, if only because the concept and execution blatantly rip-off the much better Holly Hunter film ""Living Out Loud.""  Streep, meanwhile, drones on and on about how she wishes for something more out of life, when we're never given a chance to discover why her life is so dull in the first place.  Her dialogue soon becomes repetitious to the point of madness, at which point we pray for something -- anything! -- to happen to this woman.And then our prayers our answered, and ""Adaptation"" proceeds to crash unlike any mainstream film I've seen all year.  The last 20 minutes of this film are shockingly inept, so much so that you're convinced this must be some sort of colossal joke on the filmmakers.  After all, it encompasses everything that Kaufman the film character says he wants to avoid in his screenplay.  So is the ending a sly joke on the part of Jonze and co.?  If so, the humor is lost on me, for as much as the real Kaufman may be laughing, audience members are forced to sit in their seats and watch the wretchedness wash over them.""Adaptation"" is ultimately too hip for the room, a movie that is clever, knows it's clever, and will do anything to flaunt that cleverness.  A likable film is lost in the process, which is a shame when it comes to the filmmaking geniuses here."
142,Adaptation.,1,24 December 2002,The Big Nothing,"This movie starts out fitfully amusing, what with the lead character's Woody Allen-like self-possession and self-loathing.  But it is slow and boring. The tedium grows until the awful final half hour.  This film is exactly what the main character accuses it of being:  a self-possessed, pathetic exercise.  What is it about in the end?  Why, it's all about Charlie Kaufman, of course.  Not my idea of a good time at the movies.  Try really adapting something, Chuck.  This is nothing but a big con job you've somehow managed to pull off.  The audience I saw it with hated the film, and grumbled all the way outside the theater and into the street, some wishing they had actually seen an adaptation of ""The Orchid Thief.""  Others simply saying it felt like three hours."
143,Adaptation.,2,18 November 2006,Liberal Elitism Strikes Again!,"This is a classic case of an elitist's ""thinking man's movie,"" about the creative process and evolution. In fact, the multiple plugs in here for Charles Darwin and his atheistic teachings are so overt the Liberals who made this must have thought their audience wasn't as ""smart"" as they were so they had to keep hammering home their Left Wing propaganda.After they get tired of pontificating, it settles down into more a story. However, I found the characters so immoral and neurotic that were anything but likable. The story is confusing, thanks to multiple flashbacks. I still think it's vastly overrated and is this is comedy, God help the sickos who label it as such. It's a film which attempts to be ""smart,"" but in the end is nothing but garbage wrapped in expensive paper."
144,Adaptation.,1,28 April 2004,Movie fails in the end miserably............,"I agree with another commentator who wrote this film needs a script doctor. What a disappointment! The film had everything going for it, a great cast, a thought provoking script...I was enjoying this film quite a lot, as I had Being John Malkovich also written by the same writer. But unfortunately this film had no ending!! Near the end of the film, Nicholas Cage's Charlie character has his agent tell him to get his 'twin' brother to help him with the screenplay he's writing. The screenplay that he's been writing throughout the course of the movie is in fact the movie that you're watching. Unfortunately, the 'twin' brother is a cheesy, thriller writer. And that is how they end the movie. But they don't play it for laughs. They play it straight. Or lets put it this way, if they play'd it for laughs, they didn't do a good job cuz it wasn't funny. It played like they were presenting it seriously, the ending that is, which turned into a shoot-em up at the end of the movie. Which of course, you couldn't take seriously, because you knew this was all just in the imagination of the writer 'Charlie' writing his screenplay, which is of course what it was. It was unbelievably stupid. Reminded me of nothing more than the infamous Dallas TV show storyline of having the character return from the dead and the whole thing being a dream. Really, a stupid, stupid ending to an otherwise interesting film. I just don't understand how they could have done this. I'm in shock. I really am. I'm numb......Just wanted to make sure readers of this review understand that I am totally aware that the writers purposely ended the film in this manner as a way of saying: See this is how Hollywood ends movies by making these really cheesy endings.....Yes I understand that. But making a really horrible cheesy ending as a way of ridiculing Hollywood movies that have really horrible cheesy endings is not the way to go about it folks!! All you get is a really horrible cheesy ending!!!!!"
145,Adaptation.,1,3 March 2004,The only thing good about this movie is Nicholas Cage,"This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Some would call it ""unique"" and ""interesting"", but I think its garbage. Its almost like they tried to make this movie weird and messed up so people would say wow i've never seen that before. The only thing good about it is the fact that Nicholas Cage plays a diversified role and Chris Cooper does a good job as well. Other than that why would you want to see a film like this? In my opinion if you want to watch a movie with a good plot twist thats interesting watch Momento. I feel this was a complete waste of two hours. So if your in the mood to watch a twisted, pointless movie this is the one."
146,Adaptation.,1,15 December 2003,Major disappointment,"I was looking forward to this film. Seeing Nicholas Cage and Meryl Streep explore the difficulties of writer's block could be very interesting. But it wasn't. This film is a non to intelligent quest for a film plot that we see rolling over the screen as it has been ""created"".  The film has no tempo, no coherence and the distinct smell of reality as to the theme of writer's block for the screen writers of Adaptation. It's never funny, though at times it intends to be. It's really never smart - and most of the time highly predictable. You see the writers pull out the action driven end as the proposed fix for a bad movie. But honestly it doesn't fix it at all. The film is an odd mixture of genres - and there's been made no effort at all to melt the genres into one structured plot. The plot's a mess and obviously the best the brothers could do.  Rather sad that people fall for this even less than mediocre attempt.Don't get fooled by the idea this is art. It's junk that should have been washed out in the editing process."
147,Adaptation.,1,10 August 2003,Damn it was boring...,"I just finished watching Adaptation with Nicholas cage playing the two head-roles. I must say i don't understand what all the fuss is about, in my eyes this movie sucked. It was boring and you sat around waiting for anything too happen but it never did. To be honest this was 2 of the longest hours ive experienced in a long, long time.. From watching Being John Malkovich, which i really enjoyed as one of the best movies i've seen, too watching this rubbish. There are much better movies out there which grades isn't half as good as this one's and that i don't understand. This one should have a 3 out of 10. NOT 7.9.. For everyone a big warning! this one will make you cry of boredom..3/10"
148,Adaptation.,7,7 February 2005,Unique and rewarding,"A long time did i wait before i saw ""Adaptation"". Everyone told me to see it, that it was spectacular. I have never been a fan of Charlie Kaufman or Spike Jonze though and i remained skeptical. Now however i can without a doubt say it's the best movie i have seen from them so far.The scriptwriter Charlie Kaufman is troubled. He is writing an adaptation of a book about flowers and he is completely stuck. His brother on the other hand is trying to write a script for the first time in his life, and it's a smashing success.Nicholas Cage never seizes to amaze me. He is like a chameleon. And the only thing that seems to dictate his performance is the quality of the script and direction. He can be awful and hysterical (like in Snake Eyes) or he can be sensitive and excellent like he is here. This is one of his best performances yet, and i had almost forgotten what a great actor he really is. Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper are also excellent.The story about the struggling script-writer is interesting. Even though i have no pretensions towards writing i still recognize the feelings of a complete inspirational drain. The way this movie portrays people is it's strength. However, the story itself is not spectacular and there is little of worth beyond the characters. The characters go a long way though. And this movie is very entertaining in it's own way, and doesn't feel as contrived as ""Being John Malkovich"". It's not a masterpiece but a unique and rewarding experience nevertheless. I rate it 7/10."
149,Adaptation.,10,22 February 2006,One of the best films I have seen in years on TV,"Do you have to be Shakespeare to talk about the real problems of real people in everyday life without boring your audience ? Spike Jonze's drama (NOT comedy)is a proof to the contrary. His incredibly sinuous plot with its infinite mirror effects thrives in the vicinity of Pirandello or Pinter. This film is smart, smart, smart and makes YOU feel smart. And it prompts the right questions about your own real life. What else can one expect in a movie theater ? Meryl Streep appears, as usual, gorgeous and supernaturally gifted. What a shame to inflict the dubious distinction ""best supporting actress"" upon such a bright shining star? Nicolas Cage has nothing left to prove, but he does it with his customary genius.Where does that leave 'Harry Potter' or 'Spiderman'?"
150,Adaptation.,10,9 November 2005,"Masterpiece, working on many different layers","Adaptation, written by Charlie Kaufman, may be the most original movies I have ever seen, this side of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ( also written by Kaufman ).As much as all the star power thats working in this film, the real star of this movie is the screenplay, the screenplay itself is a masterpiece. It displays the ups and downs of a writer, while inventing itself as it goes on, WHILE showing what could be Kaufman's struggles to write a screenplay of THIS movie. I find it quite interesting that every screenplay Charlie Kaufman does, it reveals a lot of his genius, whether its a film like Confessions of a Dangerous Mind or even Human Nature.Nicolas Cage does very strong work as Charlie/Donald Kaufman, twin brothers who are almost opposite yet they don't truly satisfy themselves. Charlie is a sexually frustrated writer who is in a state of writers block trying to adapt Susan Orlean's book (played by Meryl Streep). Donald on the other hand is free spirited, who doesn't have difficulty writing scripts and is also confident in social situations. This performance by Nicolas Cage very much SURPASSES his work in his Academy Award Winning performance in 'Leaving Las Vegas'. You can always tell which one is Charlie and which one is Donald ( I don't know how he did that ) and it is SUCH a strong performance.Chris Cooper plays John Laroche, an orchid thief and weirdly charming individual. What Cooper does transcends nuanced performance, he captures Laroche's nature, and steals every scene he is in. What Chris Cooper does in this movie is pure magic, he felt as though Laroche's presence changed the whole feeling of the kind of situation he is in, whether if hes caught in a predicament, being interviewed, trying to capture an orchid. Chris Cooper truly did deserve that Oscar, it was nothing short of breathtaking. Although he didn't have a challenging role as Cage did in this movie, he does blow the competition away.Meryl Streep is wonderful as Susan Orlean, a woman who has everything, but is bored and passionate at the same time. Streep combines elements of versatility, vulnerability, and passion to play Orlean. She finds all the right notes to hit in this performance and she nails it.Director Spike Jonze is a master at pacing, and really does know Kaufman's characters from the inside out. This is Spike Jonze's best effort yet. He really does achieve something from this film.There isn't much I could go off of from this movie, but there are a million other things that are good with this film. This film is a masterpiece. This film is worth the $10 to buy the Superbit DVD at Best Buy. This movie is a triumph. 10/10"
151,Adaptation.,8,7 November 2005,Clever,"I'm a sucker for cleverness, even if it verges on confusion. This one is just clever.Charley Kaufman is my new favorite writer/director, ahead of Tarantino and the Coens. But, as with the others, he needs to mature.Nicholas Cage does well, although much of the credit should go to wardrobe and make-up.Meryl Streep overacts, IMHO.One wonders how far Kaufman can go with the self-referential idea, though. I hope that he has more than concept that he can work with. Even more so, I hope that he can eventually get beyond cleverness and get some more complex human emotions into the mix. Does he need a more mature, human collaborator ? Spike Jonze is not that guy.Even Tom Stoppard needed a collaborator to make ""Shakespeare in Love"", to add humanity to cleverness. Wit alone doesn't make a memorable movie."
152,Adaptation.,10,6 October 2005,"It's Not Another Chick Flick Romance, It's A Tactical Strange Tale","I would like to start this review by saying that Adaptation is one of my all time favorite movies. It definitely places in the top five movies of 2002 in my book, which includes Gangs of New York, The Pianist, The Two Towers, and Narc. Adaptation is very unique film to watch, and every time you watch it you get something different out of it. Every line uttered says something vital to the story. Charlie Kaufman is a brilliant screenwriter, and in my opinion, it is his best script. It is funny, sad, and inspiring on so many levels. Nicholas Cage proved that he really is quite a talented actor in this picture, and Meryl Streep is amazing, too. But, it is Chris Cooper who steels the show. He deserved the Oscar that he was given for this movie. If you are sick and tired of the lack of creativity in film, then you should pick up a copy of Adaptation. It will awaken the brain from its slumber."
153,Adaptation.,5,9 August 2003,What? Definitely forgettable,"You know I feel the movie was ok.  The acting was good, which kept the audience somewhat in it.  The story was really different and unique.  But how in the heck can this movie be in the top 250.  I think this movie is barely in the top 250 this year, let alone the all-time 250. One of the biggest reasons why Im ragging this movie is because I cant believe all the good reviews this movie has gotten.  The film was descent but come on. The film is overrated.  The first hour of the movie is dry. And then the last 30 minute of the movie was just unbelievable with all the twists and turns which really got the audience thinking.  But uh, in the top 250 of all-time.
NO way. I mean this movie has the same ranking as Road to Perdition.  Road to Perdition was awesome from beginning to end.  Dont get it."
154,Adaptation.,,2 May 2003,"Weird and original, but ultimately boring.","I loved BJM, I thought it was clever, funny, interesting and above all original, so with great expectation I sat down to watch Adaptation.  As someone who has the curse of intelligence, I can relate to any character who questions all aspect of his life and his contribution to the world.  The problem is the same as spending an evening with me moaning about the world, it's not that enjoyable.This is the big problem with the film.  Yes it's very well acted, it's unusual and it's certainly original, but it just wasn't entertaining or even interesting.When I watched the tale unfold I was never saw if his twin brother was an actual person or an actual character in the film.  Even though in the credits the film is dedicated to the loving memory of Donald, I discovered that he doesn't exist as a person.  I suppose as the film mentions the 3 script and Charlie even comments on how stupid the idea is, that this is a reference to the fact that Charlie and Donald appear in the same scenes where they interact with different characters.  Where as they are aspects of the same person (I assume).Anyway original, but the musings of a self loathing, unfunny Woody Allen, isn't that interesting, no mater how unusual the film is."
155,Adaptation.,3,13 February 2003,Boom Mics,"Was I supposed to see them? Meryl Streep was great, but not sure she carried the whole movie. I guess it proved the theory stated in the film of ""Wow them at the end and you'll have a hit"" I don't feel all of the hype is warranted. Got the feeling that everybody involved with this movie knew it was mediocre but they  needed to make their money back. A little hype goes a long way."
156,Adaptation.,3,19 January 2003,pretentious waste of time,"Honestly, what is all the hoopla about?  It was a big ""insider's joke"" - a story within a story - with Nicholas Cage playing the actual writer of this film - Charlie Kaufman.  I've never seen anything more self-indulgent, yet where there's hype, there's an audience to eat it up.  I gave it a 3 out of 10.  And I only gave it this much because of the ever exquisite Meryl Streep."
157,Adaptation.,6,25 December 2002,Kissing Itself to be Clever,"Charles Kaufman and Spike Jonze are clever, and they want you to know that. So clever, so self-referential (or self-reverential, as another reviewer nicely put it), that every scene, every line, every gesture is a wink and a nudge and a nod.  This a movie that is so full of winks and nudges that it practically has Tourette's syndrome.You've read enough other reviews by now to know how clever this film is.  A struggling screenwriter wants to write about how he's a struggling screenwrither (you think 100,000 other struggling screenwriters don't already have a script about that?), how he's dedicated to art and his naughty alter ego (or ""twin brother"") tarts it up to achieve crass success. So the struggling screenwriter turns to his crass twin/alter ego to write the last third of the movie, and it turns into an inane self-parody of drugs, sex, and gun chases.  Only, it isn't that funny.  Perhaps the best part is that the self-parody goes far beyond what the actors think -- Meryl Streep no doubt thinks she's doing sublime comedy, but what's funniest is watching her play a part that she is so hopelessly ill-suited for -- watching her snort a line of green cocaine is far funnier than she knows. 
And this movie knows so much.  It knows that its critics are going to complain that it's an exercise in intellectual masturbation, so it has its main character masturbating all the time.  Very clever.  By the time it's all over (which is not until a very very long time), it's more of an exercise in intellectual impotence.BUT:  What I'd really like to know is what Susan Orlean thinks of all this. I haven't read the Orchid Thief, and wild horses couldn't drag me to do so (yes, of course that Stones' song is part of the sound track), because above all this movie makes the novel seem like the worst piece of banal recycled Hallmark greeting card trash ever foisted on mankind.  So I'm glad to see the fictionalized version of the authoress turn into a drug snorting, gun-toting moll with a trailer trash boy friend.  Is Susan Orlean still desperately trying to find something that will make her feel something? Well, she could watch this movie and feel ridiculous.  Perhaps if I had read the book, I'd congratulate this film on being a wonderful sendup.  But I doubt it would be worth the effort."
158,Adaptation.,2,10 January 2018,"Adapt, or die. I'd rather die.","I hate when reviewers post a review of a movie they didn't even finish watching. The thing is...I turned this thing off...literally...before Cage finished his opening mind twisting monologue! There's a saying in evolution: adapt, or die. I'd rather die than watch this ridiculous movie."
159,Adaptation.,10,15 December 2017,The Perfect Flower that Blooms Every Year,"ADAPTATION is a delightful film that says a lot about nature and how human destiny is inexorably linked to it.The action begins by running the credits across a blank screen, while Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) sums up his confused state of mind. This speech sums up the film's basic premise; to find a solution to our daily struggles, we should look into nature. The orchid is a perfect flower that blooms every year. And fulfills its appointed function in the universe. Wouldn't it be good if we could do the same?The task isn't as easy as Charlie thinks. He finds a story centred on the flower' but has nothing to transform it into an effective screenplay. Eventually he teams up with brother Donald (also played by Cage) to produce something workable. What the film suggests is that we should look into ourselves and our relationship to nature to find inspiration, rather than relying on familiar cliches. The twins discover this through collaboration,Charlie's story is contrasted with that of Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep)' who chases after orchid hunter John Laroche (Chris Cooper). This plot is not entirely optimistic, but she discovers there is a plausible alternative to ""chasing the story"" for those who want to look for lt. Orlean begins the film by writing faithfully in a notebook what the farmer says, but as the film unfolds she understands his desire to pursue orchids for the purpose of dissecting them so as to turn them into drugs. This drug is not a narcotic, but a means of aligning humanity with nature - it is only our puritan culture that stigmatizes this act. To watch Orlean wading through the undergrowth in search of the orchid is to watch a woman transformed by the desires of nature.Eventually the film shows Charlie having resolved his mental problems, partly through reflection, and partly by the knowledge that there is a great deal more to the world than things, and that understanding its beauties is the first step towards changing one's lifestyle. He encounters Orlean briefly, but it is chiefly through her book that he comes to realize what he has hitherto been missing.ADAPTATION is not an easy film to follow, but befits several viewings in order to understand its complex plot-structure and its oscillation over time between past and present."
160,Adaptation.,7,19 October 2017,"Focus, 'cause treasures underlie dirt.","It doesn't have to be some action movie, some obvious drama, or some comedy to lead you into liking a movie. My friend told me, ""Hey this is a good old, well it's underrated, please grab a sheet note and write down everything you notice, and focus."". And so I did, I noticed many, many things no one else without the slightest concentration would know. It really would seem pointless if you watch it mindlessly.This is a movie for grown-ups, who will to give their all to understand such a genuine and original movie. Give it a try.7/10"
161,Adaptation.,8,19 September 2017,I really wanted to love it...,"...but I don't. I have seen every Kaufman written movie Adaptation. and on, excluding Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. And I have loved every single one and they are all 10/10 perfect movies in my mind. Synecdoche, New York being my favorite film of all time.But something didn't work here. And after re-watching it one more time I think I got it. You see, all the parts with Charlie Kaufman as a struggling writer and writing the story as it goes are some of the best Kaufman stuff ever made. And the third act perfectly ties things together by letting everything that Kaufman didn't want to happen, happen. And its awful/great. But every single time it cut back to Meryl Streep in The Orchid Thief I found myself utterly bored. None of these parts seemed that integral to Kaufman's plot, so I wonder why he bothered by having them in this movie this much. I have never been this disappointed in a writer. The movie is great, but it focuses on the wrong things."
162,Adaptation.,8,3 September 2017,A good movie but depressing,"I found this movie very depressing including the ending. The actors were very good but it was still depressing. Hard to follow the plot. The characters all seemed depressed with their lives and drifting aimlessly. This is not a ""feel good"" by any stretch. Nicolas Cage does a great job playing 2 characters but this too was hard to watch. He was very tormented."
163,Adaptation.,1,28 August 2017,Awful.,"What a waste of time and a waste of NC's talent. This role didn't fit NC at all. He just wasn't believable in this role of playing, or should I say over playing, a pathetic socially timid dufus. The movie itself was boring as can be and I didn't care about any of the characters. It's ironic that NC goes to a writing seminar in the movie - I think the people that wrote this movie should have gone to a writing seminar. It's boring, slow, dumb, and about as uninteresting as it can get. Awful movie from every angle."
164,Adaptation.,10,13 August 2017,Dream-like film about flowers.,"Adaptation's plot revolves around a script-writer, Charlie Kaufman, and his brother, Donald Kaufman, and how Charlie Kaufman attempts to bring a non-fiction book about flowers called THE ORCHID THIEF into a film script to be adapted into a movie, which serves the purpose of the title of the film. Stress comes with Charlie's process of creating the script and meanwhile Donald Kaufman achieves success with his script, The 3, stirring up disgusted envy for the character Charlie Kaufman and adding to his continuous stress. Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman are both played by Nicholas Cage and each have funny, unique and likable personalities with Donald Kaufman being the naive ""stupid brother"" comic relief and Charlie Kaufman being the intelligent, experienced serious man. They both contain great chemistry on the screen considering the fact that it's played by one person only and revolve importantly in the storyline of the film while also being entertaining in their roles, and it's a pure joy to watch the two characters interact and react to the situations in the movie. Adaptation is an excellent film however mainly because it serves the purpose of feeling like a dream by feeling strangely surreal and perfectly normal at the same time, but it also raises a lot of thought-provoking questions about the topic it is on: movie scripts. Adaptation incredibly breaks the normal structure of a movie by rearranging, replacing and even removing, and sets out to do feats that no other movie would dare to do and you may find yourself wondering if the normal film structure is as good as everyone says. The film remains in a strange taste, uses voice-over narration to explain the characters and uses no ordinary structure, yet we are fascinated and entranced by the magically dream-like atmosphere of the captivating film but also being self- aware of it's actions by expressing it in an intentionally destroyed manner. When you watch this movie, I think you'll get feelings that you never thought were there."
165,Adaptation.,10,5 August 2017,Adaptation. review,"Originality, how much do we see it in modern cinema not much right? Well, Adaptation is one original film and one I will never forget. Spike Jonze has an incredible career with movies like Her, Where the Wild Things Are and Being John Malkovich. Mr. Jonze has also collaborated with an incredible screenwriter Charlie Kaufmann he has done scripts for films like Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and of course Adaptation. Both of this gentleman received an Academy Award. Adaptation is their second collaboration, what can I say this movie is one of the greatest movies of all time. The plot consists of the struggles of a writer to adapt a book. You may not be interested in the movie whatsoever neither was I until one close friend of mine recommended it to me, saw it and loved it. Nicholas Cage plays Charlie Kaufmann weird right? Nicholas Cage has an interesting career he has made good films and some bad, but we can't deny he is a great actor, he also plays Charlie Kaufmann's brother Donald (Donald is not the real brother of Charlie Kaufmann he isn't even real). Nicholas Cage gives, Meryl Streep plays Susan Orlean the writer of the book Charlie Kaufmann is trying to adapt and Chris Cooper plays John Laroche the love interest and character of Susan Orleans The Orchid Thief. All of this actors gave an award worthy performance, one of the actors Chris Cooper won the Academy Award for this movie. What this movie accomplishes the most is the script written by Charlie Kaufmann it is a fantastic script we believe the characters intentions their desire, their emotions. The editing, directing, and cinematography are fantastic, Spike Jonze and his crew made this movie a blast! This movie breaks the three act structure a method that if used well can give fantastic results. Overall Adaptation is worth a watch it is a movie for aspiring screenwriters and movie lovers go and watch it it's on Netflix."
166,Adaptation.,8,7 July 2017,The adaptation of life,"Few directors in the industry today have the ability to convey cinematographically the scripts of Charlie Kaufman, Spike Jonze is one of them. ""Adaptation"" is a film that surprises by its narrative supported by good performances and a technique aligned to the script. Telling a story that is adapting as the book progresses, the script is confusing to the viewer at first glance, but reaches a great brilliance if the viewer of a second chance for the work, the script tells a story of an antisocial screenwriter Who is unable to see his qualities and practice social interactions because of this, his twin brother that the only thing he knows is to find these qualities in his brother and has a filter in his vision that inhibits him from proceeding unless it is in his brother's footsteps , A successful journalist who ends up discovering that she does not live life to the full, and a man full of random passions that makes the journalist question his sense of love, life and society, are four very interesting characters, different and at the same time Is completed in a drama where one is based on the other to tell his story. The man of various passions, John Laroche (Chris Cooper), he really discovers a passion and a sense in life, and this inspires journalist Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) to write a book about him, which in turn inspires The rhetorician Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) to write a screenplay for this book, which for his time inspires Donald (Nicolas Cage) to become a brother-inspired screenwriter. Each one lives his story, and each one has its problems, but from the moment a character disengages from the social bubble and discovers a passion generates an excess of discomfort and curiosity in the characters, the film deals in its principle on the lie, The band of Laroche revolves around an orchid, not because of its beauty, but rather to extract drugs from it, Kaufman makes a mess and proves that all the characters without exception are completely lost in their sense of life, and even Who finds it, is a lie, because the passion of Laroche, is a lie. Kaufmann still jokes about making a concept art film and not appealing to sex, guns and explosions, but ends up appealing to sex, guns and explosions, because he discovers that life is not as boring as he imagined, things happen, unexpected paths are Traces, people die, life changes, and include sex, weapons and explosions was part of life, carrying, was part of his script. Kaufman takes the film as Stephen King, a whole narrative and made bow, characters are fully developed, and when the element of supernatural appears, it really frightens, as it is not what we were expecting, in the scripts of Kaufman, when the madness arrives, She picks us up completely and leaves us bewildered, this is yummy and it happens this long several times. Technically the film is good, it has a soundtrack that mixes common pop sound, has a clear photograph, Spike Jonze is much more contained in this film, and does the basics without trying a lot, but does what it has to do, it is difficult to guide the Acts of the film or talk about the rhythm of it, because it gains pace and loses, wins and loses .... Nicolas Cage is fine and Meryl Streep also, nothing of great performances, although I think that Chris Cooper steals the scenes always that shows. ""Adaptation"" is Spike Jonze's second film, where he lets the rhetorician's work stand out over his direction - of course, he has adapted a wacky script with extraordinary competence - nor does the rhythm problems spoil the film at all, The film has a perfect message and can be taken a million interpretations of it, unfortunately many will misinterpret the third act, and take away the seriousness of the long classifying it as any crazy comedy, this is sad, it could be different, but it is a Great movie and deserves to be seen and reviewed."
167,Adaptation.,10,27 June 2017,"playfully bizarre, yet profoundly philosophical, this is among the greatest movies I have ever seen","Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze are both known for creating weird, quirky movies, and this may be their weirdest and quirkiest, but it is also their most brilliant in a way (although Kaufman's project ""Synecdoche, New York"" may be slightly ahead of this in terms of genius). It is a mindbogglingly meta comedy that subverts any and all expectations gleefully. Those expecting a cliché Hollywood comedy and those expecting an art house classic would both be equally shocked by the unexpected twists and turns this manic film takes. First of all, it's very premise is odd and original as screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's lead protagonist is a screenwriter by the name of Charlie Kaufman. Kaufman is adapting a book, which is real, while his twin brother, who is not real, is trying to help him while also becoming a successful screenwriter himself, indulging in thriller clichés and being greatly rewarded for doing so. By the end, this mildly autobiographical take on Charlie Kaufman's own life and struggles becomes a surprisingly violent suspense thriller, and considering the fact that the film's writing credit is partially given to the fictional Donald Kaufman, one can expect that his own script influenced those, more ""out-of-this- world"" areas of the film. Seriously, the final half hour of ""Adaptation"" is something of an extended punchline that keeps getting crazier by the second.Funny, fresh, and original, like all of Kaufman's finest work, ""Adaptation"" is an unconventional film to say the least, one that borders on complete experimentalism (mainly in story rather than visuals; although there are creative visuals as well, this being a movie directed by Spike Jonze) while also remaining accessible to any audience member that can even remotely wrap their mind around what's happening. Mixing magic realism with satire with tragedy with romance and so on, ""Adaptation"" is a slice of Charlie Kaufman's fascinating, unique, funny, and occasionally depressed mind that also is filled with great characters and performances (Nicolas Cage is often harshly criticized, but he portrayal of two very different characters in this film is astounding, and Chris Cooper is simply perfect in his supporting role as the central subject of ""The Orchid Thief"", the book that this film partially adapts) as well as one of the mot startlingly mind blowing movie concepts in recent memory."
168,Adaptation.,10,6 May 2017,Brilliant Movie,"Adaptation is a brilliant movie about a passionate man, a book, and a script. Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman did an incredible job directing and writing. The script is a masterpiece flawlessly layering one story on top of another. I also likes the use of voice over. It is well shot, especially the scenes in the swamp. I also like the use of scenes of the Being John Malkovich set. It has a wonderful cast with incredible performances by Meryl Streep, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Nicholas Cage who plays dual roles. Adaptation is a brilliant movie. It is a fun adventure in the art of storytelling. It is one of the best movies to come out of the 2000's. It is one of my favorite movies, I can watch it over and over. It is a movie anybody interested in movies should see."
169,Adaptation.,8,6 May 2017,Characteristically smart cinema from Charlie Kaufman & Spike Jonze,"Building on the success of 1999's ""Being John Malkovich"", Charlie Kaufman & Spike Jonze re-teamed for 2002's ""Adaptation"", which turned out to be another distinctive offering. The semi-autobiographical story focuses on screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage), who is struggling to complete an adaptation of a book about orchid poaching.Not exactly the most intriguing premise, I know, but the real Kaufman's Oscar-nominated screenplay is far from your average Hollywood concoction. The character's problems with adapting an essentially plot-less book merely supply the foundation for explorations on the creative process & human passion. Even though the movie skewers Hollywood artifice it cleverly makes use of formulaic tropes in a new and interesting way. Taking such mundane material and making it both thought-provoking & entertaining was no small feat.The cast seems to have been well-suited to the material. Nicolas Cage did double duty as Charlie Kaufman and his identical brother Donald. Cage performances can definitely be erratic but this one (which was Oscar-nominated) has to be considered one of his best. Do I even need to comment on twenty time Oscar nominee Meryl Streep's performance? It's good, of course (not to mention the source of one of her Oscar nominations). However, it was Chris Cooper who stole the show with his note-perfect portrayal of rustic orchid thief John Laroche. His Oscar was well deserved.The direction by Spike Jonze may not have been Oscar-nominated but it certainly could have been, if for no other reason than the performances that he coaxed from his three main actors. Of course, as seen with ""Being John Malkovich"" and subsequent films, Jonze also knows a thing or two about crafting striking visuals. This film is no exception. From a music standpoint, there isn't much that sticks in my memory apart from an effective use of the Turtles' classic ""Happy Together"".All in all, ""Adaptation"" offers a refreshing combination of art and entertainment. The talent both behind and in front of the camera all put their best foot forward in bringing this unique story to the screen. Fans of Kaufman & Jonze are certain to enjoy this even though others may be put off by some of the film's idiosyncrasies."
170,Adaptation.,7,15 December 2016,"I'm not really sure what to think about this movie and that's exciting, isn't it?","Adaptation.I'm not really sure what to think about this movie and that's exciting isn't it?The story lays down a path of unrequitedness, a desire if you will, to pursue and channel something that is not able to assume the idea which you had for it originally.A female writer for the New Yorker decides to compose a story about orchids and the interesting man who cultivates, harvests and understands them. In so creating the seed of this idea (pardon me) she spawns a multitude of reactions that stem from it.The story begins by following journalist Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) on her visit into the life of the horticulturist, John Laroche (Chris Cooper). She writes about the elusive Ghost orchid and what she feels while gathering information for her story. She addresses notions on passion, pursuit, and how they ultimately tie themselves together in her life. Within the original plot there is another one that develops alongside of it. Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) is attempting to write a screenplay of the book written by Susan but is having a hard time adapting the concept into a motion picture. Within the movie the two plots intertwine creating a meta nature that is impossible to ignore.Humanity, history and life as it moves ever forward is constantly repeating and readjusting to conform to that which surrounds it and Adaptation. does exactly that. The story breaks down complicated ideas, metabolizes them, and adjusts itself accordingly; it is Ouroboros and its willingness to eat its own tail.Adaptation. does not focus on the usual feelings one receives at the end of a movie, contentedness, resolution, and understanding. And while the movie still allows for those necessary components the story is a focus on people and their relentless fight against themselves."
171,Adaptation.,10,22 June 2016,Adaptation.,"""Adaptation"" is about the man who wrote this screenplay trying to adapt ""The Orchid Thief"" into a movie but ultimately failing in what he set out to do. This movie may have a seemingly happy ending, but it's ultimately a failure in every aspect of what Charlie sets out to do in the beginning of the film. He doesn't want the film to be ""hollywoodized"". No drugs, no sex, no car chases, no violence, and the characters don't learn anything in the end, because life isn't like that, and he's right. Charlie hates himself and is too busy self loathing to change as a person. His life is a bundle of missed opportunities and disappointments, such as the moment in the beginning where Charlie doesn't kiss Olivia. He successfully wrote ""Being John Malkovich"" which everyone loved, but can't seem to write this next screenplay. He wants to improve and change as a writer, and he tries and tries plenty of different things, but he ends up taking the easy route and succumbing to all the things he didn't want to do in the beginning (see the list above).So, what's the point? Well, after the movie takes a turn towards the end and starts becoming more ""Hollywood"", Susan says ""I learned that change isn't a choice. It happens to all of us"" or something along those lines. But I think the real point is that change is a choice. The reason Charlie doesn't kiss Olivia is because he is afraid and uncomfortable. It's a risk, and he'd rather continue being his self loathing self than take a risk because that is what he is comfortable with. Olivia stops seeing him, he learns nothing and continues his life. Because that's the way life is for most of us. Even for Susan Orlean. She starts to do something new with John Laroche, but then decides against it, because it's out of her comfort zone, so it goes nowhere. The only person that has really gone through change in the film is John, and it specifically emphasizes that he changed because he just decided to in the scene in which he tells Susan how he suddenly stopped obsessing over fish and the ocean, despite loving it."
172,Adaptation.,8,25 May 2016,Do I have an original thought in my head? My bald head?,"Writing in its own accord, is a lot like life. It is a journey into the unknown, holding no guarantees. It is only through the privilege of birth that we can at least conceive of its complexity, taking the many ups and downs it brings forth, shaping us more and more as we continue. Whenever some poor schmuck says, ""I did everything right"", just moments after he's tasted failure, there is even more silence at the uncertainty we all face in our individual lives, knowing that the only thing guaranteed is death. Just three years, after the Success of Being John Malkovich, Spike Jonze returned with the introspective talent of his wunderkind screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman. Like Being John Malkovich, Adaptation once again tackled Kaufman's curiosity with identity, looking further into life, through the eyes of another person. However, this time, instead of controlling Malkovich's mind, the audience was given the chance to examine the mind of a person Kaufman still hoped to understand, Charlie Kaufman. Kaufman (Cage) fat, bald fat, and self-loathing to the extent that through his voice- over narrations, there is merely pity and humor spread around. After the success and praise of the Malkovich script, Kaufman is hired by Columbia to adapt the best seller, The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean. Despite his desire to avoid the more modern standard of story structure, Kaufman's doubts and fears plunge him further into an abyss of despair and loneliness as he finds little material for a story or characters. Charlie's Brother Donald (Cage), equally fat and bald, but infinitely jolly sticks to the more conventional Hollywood approach to screen writing, using every possible cliché to write his script. As if mooching off him wasn't enough, he gives Charlie pointers, further driving him towards insecurity and self-depriving voice over's. On the other end of the story, comes the tale of Susan Orlean (Streep) as she follows up with the wily adventurous Horticulturist, John Laroche (Cooper). Through her own voice over narration, her own literary journey comes with less uncertainty than Kaufman, but equally intriguing curiosity. She describes Laroche as tall, handsome, and having barely any teeth, as she follows up on his quest to find a rare flower called, the ghost orchid. In comparison to Kaufman, Orlean's narration is told with more confidence and integrity. However, despite this, there is doubt in her mind as she is not self-realized, finding little to truly care about, let alone knowing the feeling of such a passion. Charlie has this longing passion, ultimately fearing it to the extent that it will only cause him to fail and further hate himself. The real Kaufman, although honest about his doubts, believes in the power of this passion. In 2011, at the BFI in London, Kaufman gave a speech for Bafta's screen writing series. He elaborated on the individual, and how there is a part inside them that is never filled. Kaufman identified this part as a wound inside us that is the thing that we are afraid of showing. ""We fear how weak it may make us look. We fear that we won't be loved."" But, in Kaufman's eyes, this wound also symbolizes a deep and self-defining part within us. It is the very thing that gives birth to a writer's screenplay. Adaptation is based on Kaufman's own struggle to adapt The Orchid Thief, and as entertaining as it can be within the goofy and nervously humorous expressions of Nicolas Cage, there is a deeper message behind the soul searching and writer's block. In a desperate attempt to finish his script, Charlie goes to New York, and attends a screenwriter's seminar by Robert McKee. McKee (Cox) who wrote ""STORY"" which delves into the fundamental concepts of formulating a story. Despite lesson after lesson Kaufman reaches his moment of truth when he pitches an idiotic idea for a story, where nothing much happens in life, ""More of a reflection of the real world."" After a brutal verbal assault from McKee, then and only then does Charlie truly begin to write his story. Regardless of its flaws, Charlie no longer reaches for some mundane concept of perfection, but instead a story that hopes to deliver that inner beauty the real Kaufman, as well as any writer hopes to share with the world when telling a story. A story can take many forms, and it can embody many themes. It can say many things about the person who wrote it. For an individual such as Kaufman, there is a desire to share a part of themselves that is beyond the story itself. The duality of Nicolas Cage's performance brings out a fragility and a humane charm that goes further from his innocent and often vulnerable facial expressions. In interviews, Charlie Kaufman comes off as somewhat shy, but empathetic in his behavior. He has expressed his own doubt in the conception of this script, the many difficulties it brought him, and through his fictionalized self, we see the desire for someone to share something he feels both passionate about and equally afraid. When expressing his hopes of adapting ""The Orchid Thief"", Kaufman tells McKee how much he wants to be honest to the story, and show how flowers are ""God's Miracles."" Both poetic, and accurate, the flower does sustain our existence through an adaptive process of evolution. All living beings have a specific purpose, and by nature itself we are part of a cycle of life that goes beyond our own understanding. Charlie Kaufman's spoof or parody, although funny, speaks ahead of his Kaufman's nervous voice overs, and explores life within its numerous complexities, bringing both the beautiful and the ugly side of his characters. In Adaptation Kaufman, Orlean, and Laroch live a daily existence of excitement and doubt as they follow many passions, hoping to acquire a fragment of ultimate satisfaction. As naive as a notion as that is, the search is all the more invigorating in the many mysteries our journey through life holds."
173,Adaptation.,4,16 April 2016,Adaptation. is weak.,"Take note that I am a fan of Charlie Kaufman. Synecdoche, New York is among my very favorite movies; I also think quite highly of Anomalisa and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. However, Adaption. is one I dislike. Adaptation. enters a vicious cycle as the writer attempts to create a film to impress and glorify the media, close-minded 'cinephiles,' critics, and pretentious award voters, despite on the surface appearing to attack or satirize said peoples. The film is exactly for those peoples. One could easily consume such manipulative garbage. With this perspective of glorification, Kaufman loses track of the actual purpose of a film which is to either send a message to its viewers, whether it is implicitly or explicitly, give insight to a particular setting or people, or to add something new or comment on the art form efficiently. Adaptation. does not deliver in any of those regards. This does not have much of a message. Instead it glorifies itself within its meta-structured plot. What is really the purpose of this structure? It is very much a gimmick, it is hard to properly deny this fact. In its glorification of media, it tries to experiment with this meta- structure to merely impress others. I believe that people are meant to focus on real life and watch films to gain new perspectives or to broaden our creative and critical thinking. The writer however merely glorifies media to the detriment of not caring about real life. It's self-annihilating and humiliating for those who want to make media for the better purposes. Such people this film panders to often are caught up in the consumption of said media. There is a scene where Charlie Kaufman reviews the script that he is writing (the movie itself) and admits to himself and his fictional twin reasons why the script is narcissistic and weak, which in fact is true. Saying something is bad does not automatically escape it from being bad and become ironically good. That's still bad writing. There is a great scene (a scene doesn't make a film) where McKee gives Kaufman advice on both screen writing and life, while pointing out reasons why the script isn't working as a film. He barely follows said advice. As an adaptation of a novel, the film does not find a passion for the source material and instead relies itself on being nihilistic and self-loathing, offering little if anything of substance but instead panders to pseudo-intellectual audiences and people who love films. The film is hateful to itself; it gives no reason to actually like it beyond superficial and pretentious reasons. Interestingly enough, other good scenes are the ones that are actually based on the book. Unfortunately, the random content in its climax undoes any shred of honesty found before. The meta- structure and indirect fourth-wall breaking are negative. In a way, it is honest about how weak the script truly is, except until the ending where it pretends to be good. The selfish nature of the protagonist acts as if we, the audience should direct our attention away from the fact the adaptation script is poor and towards Kaufman's struggles with embracing a poor script for what it is. This ironically makes it a brilliant script, but mostly to those who easily consume manipulative poor narcissistic scripts. The film is about itself and offers absolutely nothing substantial but instead masks itself in its self-awareness of being narcissistic and poor. Throughout the film, Kaufman hates the script he is writing and eventually gives up and makes the film about itself. I disagree with the notion of it being a good film at its core. However there are definitely good scenes and aspects to be found within the movie, mostly of which are the adaptation of the book. Using the writings of Susan Orlean makes the film appear better than it truly is as she as an author has much to say, very much beyond superficial ways unlike Kaufman in this case.Orlean writes: ""The world is so huge that people are always getting lost in it. There are too many ideas and things and people too many directions to go. I was starting to believe that the reason it matters to care passionately about something is that it whittles the world down to a more manageable size. It makes the world seem not huge and empty but full of possibility."" Adaptation. does not act upon this statement properly. Kaufman never decides to find such a passion for the script and ""whittle the world down to a more manageable size."" Instead, the character embraces the poor script, and while finding a satisfying conclusion (manipulated by a sudden change of events), he settles on the self-indulgent nature of himself rather than Orlean's book. In the process, the real Kaufman turns a real person into a drug-addicted psychopath with murderous intentions, completely jarring/inconsistent with the character's previous traits. With this in mind, Kaufman's script is not good, but Susan Orlean's writing is.The film's title is not just about an adaptation of a novel but also the adaptation of mankind and people's constant need and struggle to change and grow. However, the protagonist never truly grows; he just becomes more and more selfish and narcissistic. By the end of the film, rather than actually changing for the better, the vague message seems to be to just give in and give up as that is exactly what the character of Charlie Kaufman does. It is good, despite narcissistic, that his personality becomes less depressed and happier by the end, though it does seem rather jarring that this occurs not long after the death of his brother. Take note that mindlessly disagreeing with my stance doesn't make a person not the exact pseudo- intellectual and pretentious audience this film is obviously pandering to. The superficial nature of the film may reveal itself to others as it did to me."
174,Adaptation.,6,20 March 2016,Overrated Naval GazingPainfulKauffman & Jonze Channel  Woody Allen,"It's No Surprise that this Film has received Glowing Reviews by Virtually Every Professional Movie Critic on the Planet. After All, They are Writers. Those Insecure, Self-Centered Types that Live Alone, Work at Home, and most of Their Sexual Activities Involve Self.So You See, this is a Movie about Them. The Writer has Wooed Them without any Effort at all. So the Screenplay Wallows in Self-Loathing and Narcissism at Length at the Expense of the Audience. Irritating, Borderline Boring, and Frequently Ugly to Look At.It's a Dart-Board Story where the Writer Flings the Projectile and Where it Goes No One Knows. But You can Bet on One Thing. It will end up Somewhere, like a Boomerang, back at the Egocentric who Flung the Thing.Charlie Kaufman, the Real-Life Writer has done some Good Work. This isn't it. Venturing into Woody Allen Territory here, He only Demonstrates that He's No Woody Allen. This Film is a Chore and Laborious to get through. While Nic Cage Bares His Soul and Gives it His All, most of the Time He Appears to be Acting. Chris Cooper is the Best of the First Rate Cast. Meryl Streep comes off OK in the most Underwritten Character in the Film and is Perhaps the Most Likable. But She doesn't have much to do.Director Spike Jonze tries to keep up the Quirk for the Intelligentsia and while most of His Movies are Anything but Mainstream, He nevertheless has the Critics Hypnotized and Continues to be Beyond Criticism. Audiences on the Other Hand are not always so Easily Manipulated. In the End, it seems that both Jonze and Kaufman do Their Work to Please Themselves First (their passion). They are Both Successful, Professionally, so Why Stop Now, and Loving One Self is So Much Fun."
175,Adaptation.,8,1 February 2016,"Very Unique and Interesting, but Very Slow at Times","I didn't really have too many expectations going into this movie. I knew that it was made by the creators of Being John Malkovich, so I assumed that it'd just be really weird but still amazing. It wasn't that weird in the end, but it was amazing. The plot is quite brilliant. A screenwriter is given the most boring story in the world and told to write a script for a movie about it. It may not sound particularly interesting, but the way it's presented is great. And how many movies about writing boring scripts are there anyway? The plot is done extremely well, leaving me thoroughly impressed by the end. The characters are pretty good. The main relationships shown are between Susan Orlean and John Laroche, and Charlie and his brother, Donald Kaufman (both of whom are played by Nicholas Cage, so it's more his relationship with himself). Both relationships are developed quite well, and the individual characters are quite good too. But their relationships are the better of the two developments of them. It wasn't any phenomenal development or anything, but it was good enough to keep you invested. Unfortunately at various points I found that I was checking my clock, suspecting that the ending was coming, only to find that there was another hour or forty minutes or so left. It felt like it was about to end multiple times, but never did (until it did of course). It wasn't always paced poorly, but it could have been better. It wasn't necessarily boring, it was just slow at times. Overall Adaptation is fantastic. A great execution of its plot and good character relationships make this a solid movie. It does suffer from poor pacing and slowness at times, which made it hard to get through at times. In the end I'd definitely still recommend this movie. Despite the wait, it's well worth your time."
176,Adaptation.,10,26 September 2015,Absolutely Amazing,"Anybody who has ever wanted to become a filmmaker or wrote a screenplay before can probably relate to this movie.Adaptation is a unique spin on real life events surrounding Charlie Kaufman's psychological struggle to adapt The Orchid Thief into a feature length film and his journey of self discovery to becoming a better screenwriter and his intertwining story with Susan Orlean the author of The Orchid Thief book played terrifically by Meryl Streep, and the Orchid thief himself John Laroche played excellently by Chris Cooper. Nicolas Cage gives his best performance(s) as Charlie Kaufman and his polar opposite twin brother Donald Kaufman.Adaptation features sharp commentary on the film industry and the struggles that all writers face as they seek new and creative ways to write stories.Incredibly intelligent writing, sharp comedy, deep characters, and gravitas performances all come together as one in Adaptation, my favorite movie of all time(outside The Dark Knight Saga)."
177,Adaptation.,10,14 July 2015,The Greatest Movie of the 21st Century,"I have never seen a movie quite as amazing as Adaptation (2002). The plot is intelligent, innovative, ingenious, and in all, incredible. Nicolas Cage expertly portrays the struggle of Charlie Kaufman, the self-loathing screenwriter trying to adapt the book, 'The Orchid Thief', and just as well, portrays the happy-go-lucky, at times, silly, and ultimately wise Donald Kaufman, Charlie's twin brother.We also couldn't forget Susan Orlean, the woman desperate for passion, played by Meryl Streep, and the Academy Award winning performance by Chris Cooper as John Laroche, the ""smartest man he knows"".By the end of this movie, I understood what it meant to be in love, and, without a doubt, never listened to the song 'Happy Together' without getting teary-eyed again."
178,Adaptation.,6,6 May 2015,Not quite,"Twin screenwriters have contrasting fortunes with their current projects, and fall into deadly peril when the cheerful one helps out the miserable one.Good laughs in this and it's very clever. Cage is excellent in the dual role, Streep does a particularly good turn at a dinner party, Cooper is great, and everyone else is good, including a rather attractive Judy Greer as a waitress.The pace begins to slack off about halfway through, and we end up with a dreadful melodrama. I get we're in a Donald movie, rather than Charlie's fevered world of self loathing, but I didn't see the point of it. Maybe it's the divided self uniting for a happy ending, but the parody didn't seem the best way to get there in the end, especially when there was so much deep stuff early on about adaptation.I'm sure I missed lots of clever stuff, and it's probably well worth a critical analysis."
179,Adaptation.,10,9 July 2014,"Philosophic and light, parodical and conform, sad and humoristic and you know what? It works! Scr** film rules (but don't).","If you haven't seen this, you haven't seen a movie about itself yet, or its own creation, ..though it may all be fictionn most probably is, but realistic enough. Confused? That's the point, or is it just to amuse us, or fill our spoiled desire? This film is underlying with so many messages, philosophic, wit humoristic, even film- en screen-writing technic (yes in the movie itself) and parodical on that and back... I will have to see this one again, there must be things I missed. It's just LOADED! And I hope you all do watch it. It has been a while since I gave 10 stars. The best thing on which I laughed my socks of and really LOL'ed -literally laughed out loud and I am not that kind of guy- was that the very basic things this movie is playing a parody on, are being used non-parodically, zspecially near the end, just almost not the end itself. Breaking sweat at the end for parody lovers. But everyone should get it. For film critics, this is a MUST!!!"
180,Adaptation.,10,9 May 2014,Amazing,"This movie es amazing! I love the fact of a story written in the words of a writer, the paradox between movies written for Hollywood audience and other types of audience is amazing, it is a topic that concerns everybody because that blurred line that divides the pure expression of the artist and its way of seeing words, and in this case orchids and its metaphor of adaptation and that other pole, represented by Douglas or Mckee.. its inspirational in the world of creation, not only in the arts, but the creation of different perspectives to answers to the different situations that life presents us.. I also love the division of that concept that Charlie has in the beginning of the movie, and that cathartic experience he has with his brother's work to realize that he has to remove certain ideas, that in the end are reflects in the movie: that persecution, and the ""casual"" accident of John been eaten by those alligators."
181,Adaptation.,9,17 April 2014,A Brilliant Adaptation,"What a great movie this was. Charlie Kaufman is writing a movie about Charlie Kaufman with/about Donald Kaufman and others, who are writing a movie about Charlie Kaufman with/about Donald Kaufman and others, it's laugh out loud genius really. Adaptation is like the film Inception on some levels, as Inception takes you to the different levels and layers within a dream/within the dream state, Adaptation takes you to different levels and layers within a man's bizarre mind. Charlie Kaufman is an absolute genius for having written this. And of course, to be true to the concept of the film, you have to delineate it to the core ergo also nominate the fictional Donald Kaufman for an Academy Award as well. Absolutely brilliant! The turn this film takes towards the end is hilarious, it's so laugh out loud funny because again, it's so genius where it goes. One could say some of the characters really existed, I think it was just all Charlie, as Donald was describing in the screenplay he was writing. It'd be interesting to know in real life if Charlie Kaufman wrote this film knowing that this was exactly how he wanted to write it or if he actually had some struggles or knew some of the people like Charlie(Nicolas Cage) did in the film. I love the epiphany too, 'You are what you love, not what loves you.' Great Film! Very much worth watching."
182,Adaptation.,6,17 March 2014,Nothing says ha-ha-ha like this movie!,"Now... I don't know how to phrase my thoughts on this, because the movie really is on the verge of being somewhat clever with all this irony and what-not, and... The word ""ingenious"" is often thrown at the table when clever people start talking about this movie. Well, here is the bottom line of the movie: it basically goes on and on about how you shouldn't do clichés and in the end it does all the clichés it says it wouldn't do, well look at the irony! Isn't that funny ha-ha-ha. I mean, first you say you wouldn't do something and then you go and do just the thing you said you wouldn't do, get it? Get it? Ingenious, eh? Okay, so maybe this routine was funny already when the Simpsons started doing the exact same thing 10 years before the movie was out. So it wasn't particularly, shall we say, original in the truest meaning of the word. But it is the way they did it, right? I mean, in Simpsons you can see it coming. But in this movie, wow, you never knew would turn into.. whatever it turns to, I ain't gonna spoil it for ya.Now, don't get me wrong, I liked the darned thing. You are getting me wrong, aren't you? You think I didn't get it and now I'm trying to avoid feeling stupid so I'm badmouthing the movie here instead? Well, maybe you're right, I mean we can't all be as clever as the rest of you are, for example it is very difficult for me to be like the people on Merryl Streep's dinner party where they have a good laugh making fun of a stupid hillbilly who, instead of being ironic, tries to find meaning to his life and actually, well, do something he - dare I say it - do something he loves. (Yes, the irony was also directed towards clever people who think they know how clever they are when they are making fun of less clever people who don't get irony quite as well as they do, well wasn't that clever, ha-ha-ha!) But seriously. Seriously. Making fun of clichés and structures. What is the best adjective to describe this? Ingenious? Brilliant? Original? Nah. The word ""hipster"" comes to my mind. Hipsters have been doing it for god-knows-how-long. I betcha that most of the people who liked this movie wear thick glasses and listen to indie rock music. There's nothing wrong with it, don't get me wrong! Being just a little bit hipsterish is trendy and whatnot. I tried it just a bit when I was in school, but then I got tired of being all ironic all the time. Wears you out, you know? After a while nothing feels like nothing no more, you know? And oh yes, even though this sort of irony is trendy nowdays - and believe me, it was very trendy already in 2003 when I was in school - still, movies have used it surprisingly little compared to, say, books or television shows. Movies have relied on structures quite heavily, haven't they? Darn all those Donald Kaufmans of the world! So yes, in that sense the movie was bold, yes, at least it was bold.Now, as for trying to get rid of all the limits of storytelling, like the movie preaches... But in the end isn't that just another limit to your stotytelling? Because if you don't find new limits to replace the old ones - what can you do except be ironic? Irony is the ultimate state of being limitless, I suppose. (Well, showing all sorts of random crap in random order might be even more limitless, and some Europeans have tried even that I guess, but irony is really the closest thing we have of being limitless and still having something to say.) So there is a certain anarchy-factor to irony in that sense. But freedom and anarchy are not really quite the same thing. Now, as for using structures - well, look at Chaplin's City Lights, or Sunset Boulevard, or Dr. Strangelove, or One flew over the cockoo's nest, or Amadeus, or - these movies all use irony to make a point or two within certain strucutres, well that's a bit out-dated now isn't it? But still they are ingenious more or less, at least they have their flashes of great moments and insights. Using irony in a meta-fictional way instead of trying to find those insightful moments with it - I mean, instead of using it like those grumpy old geezers like Chaplin or Milos Forman - ha-ha-ha, well I guess that's kinda funny too. Kinda. You know what touched me most in the movie? When Merryl Streep gets all sad and whatnot listening to all the ironic jokes around the table, why, she even laughs along with those people before going to the bathroom feelin sad. This movie wasn't good because of the irony. This movie was good because it dared to say that making a movie like this is not ingenious. It is sad. It tells us a little bit of ourselves. We are a sad generation. What are we going to do about it? Laugh about it, I guess. Ha-ha-ha."
183,Adaptation.,10,21 February 2014,Not Enough Exposure,"I have spoken to so many people about this film and ironically not a single one of them has ever heard of it; this is shocking! I love the way Nicholas Cage pulls off playing twin brothers; he was really fantastic as Donald and Charlie. In real life, Charlie Kauffman is a real writer and director, whereas Donald is a fictional character. The twins are geeky, I'd say odd really, but Donald seems to have it more together regarding, women and his work (they're both screenplay writers). In any case, you can't' help but feel sorry for Charlie who seems to be lacking in all the areas his twin succeeds in. He's trying so desperately to catch up. Of course Meryl Streep was on her game! Her character, Susan Orlean is very intriguing as she lives two separate lives. She has a husband and is an author, but during her research for her book, The Orchid Thief, she falls in a life of drugs and sex with John Laroche, played by Chris Cooper. Laroche is helping Susan with information on the orchid; he even takes her out into the everglades of Florida to find it. Charlie Kauffman is trying to write the screenplay of Susan's book and in doing so, but he gets writer's block. He wants to meet with Susan to discuss the book, but for some unknown reason, maybe self esteem issues and depression keeps him from seeing her. Donald goes in Charlie's place but feels that she isn't being honest during the interview and reports that back to Charlie. At that point they both follow her down to Florida where she meets up with John. Susan and John have sex and use the drug made from the Ghost Orchid. In the meantime, Charlie is watching through the window when John sees him. Laroche drags him into the house and they question what he was doing, then Susan recognizes him from the interview (who was actually Donald, but she's unaware there's a twin). She freaks out and says they have to kill him or he'll expose her. They take Charlie by gunpoint into the swamp; Donald was hiding on the floor in the back of the car. The twins manage to escape and spend the night in the swamp. When they awake the next morning they start heading toward the road when they are spotted; John shoots Donald by accident. Donald and Charlie make it to the road and drive off only to hit another vehicle throwing Donald out the windshield; he dies. Charlie takes off running in the swamp again and is once again spotted, but before John can shoot him, an alligator grabs him. Susan is desperate, holding John and crying, basically blaming all of it on Charlie. They both make it out of the swamp and Charlie calls his mother, Susan is arrested, Charlie confesses he's still in love to his ex girlfriend and finally finishes the script. It's an interesting film to say the least. Though the film was nominated in four categories, they didn't win (of course they were up against Roman Polanski's ""Pianitst' amongst all the other top movies that year.) However, Golden Globes were won by both Streep and Cooper (also the Academy Award) for their supporting rolls and Kauffman won for best adapted screenplay at the British Academy Awards; Cage was nominated for several awards. t recommend seeing this with an open mind; I lent this to someone and they didn't' get it I suppose they weren't paying attention."
184,Adaptation.,9,14 September 2013,Beauty of Cinema!,"Adaptation is a movie that strengthens my love for cinema. It shows that not all movies have to be big blockbusters to be enjoyable, but they can also be thought-provoking, abstract films to be enjoyed. This is a dandy of a film thanks to the brilliant writing of Charlie Kaufman, wonderful directing by Spike Jonze, and just amazing acting by the cast.This addicting film is about a screenwriter just off the success of Being John Malkovich, is trying to adapt a book about orchids into a full feature film but is running into countless number of problems. Meanwhile we see the author of that book Susan Orleans getting to know the protagonist of the book, John Laroche.The acting is phenomenal. Nicolas Cage delivers a wonderful performance and is up to his usual craziness. Meryl Streep is Meryl Streep and delivers another strong performance. But Chris Cooper steals the show. He always been a great actor, but this is his most defining role.Overall, this is a wonderful film about the oddities of Hollywood and screen writing. It's refreshingly original and quite dazzling. I wish Spike Jonze would make films more often. This is a magnificent film and furthers increases the wonders of cinema. I rate this film 9/10."
185,Adaptation.,8,30 August 2013,A clever twist on the plight of the writer,"The high concept of this film is that it follows a screenwriter as he writes the film we are watching. Nic Cage plays the writer whose struggles adapting a book for the screen lead him to add himself to the script as the protagonist (the writer adapting the book). It's all very clever. In one scene the writer decides how to start the film, and it's the way this film starts. When he enlists the help of his writer brother (whose specialty genre is ""thriller""), the film takes a noticeable turn.ADAPTATION. (2002) is mind-bending screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's follow-up to BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999), both directed by Spike Jonze. Nic Cage actually plays ""Charlie Kaufman"", the writer of the Malkovich movie. The opening credits attribute the screenplay to both Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman, the fictional in-movie brother. Thus the script we see unfold in ADAPTATION. is really the script being written by the characters *in* the film.Inspired by the real-life Kaufman's experience, the film shows how a book adaptation becomes a movie about the writer adapting the book. Once you tune in to the film's meta style, you can appreciate what it has to say about writing, life, and the human experience."
186,Adaptation.,9,5 August 2013,One of the best movies of the last decade,"If you're looking at a proof that Nicolas Cage is a talented actor and that he actually can do some good movies- this is the one.Very smart, funny, dramatic, exciting movie. Perhaps slightly confusing at times, but (to me at least) that's kind of a good thing. The cast is brilliant: Chris Cooper gives the role of a lifetime, Meryl Streep is as brilliant as ever (the phone conversation scene is my favorite in the movie) and Nicolas Cage's double take goes down as likely his greatest performance. Though I'm not the biggest fan of the swamp-chasing part, it adds action to the numerous genres this film explores. It's a very original and a extremely enjoyable movie. Very much worth watching!"
187,Adaptation.,10,24 February 2013,The first recursive movie I've seen,"The most original screenplay I've ever seen. It is the first recursive movie I've every seen: The screenplay that Charlie Kaufman writes in the film IS the film you're watching.The movie drops hints that as Charlie struggles to write this screenplay, he's making references to things we've already seen. Note also how the last third of the film is drastically different from the beginning: It changes moods rather quickly into a morbid chase-action thriller. This occurs right after Donald decides to help Charlie and also after the seminar speaking tells Charlie to ""wow them in the last third."" One can't help but imagine this as the film version of the M.C. Esher drawing with the two hands drawing each other. There is no clear divide between fiction and reality, as the inner fiction (the screenplay Charlie is writing) becomes the film we are watching (the reality).Furthermore, this film was also thoroughly entertaining. It does not push this abstract concept at the expense of entertainment.Another tidbit of appreciation from me: adaptation is used as a pun here. It refers to both for the process of adapting a book into a screenplay and the process by which all organisms (orchids, bees, etc.) adapt to the environment and each other.A very, very cerebral film from Kaufman, a true genius."
188,Adaptation.,4,20 January 2013,Smart........But Empty,"The Director, the producers and the actors must have been excited when they started this project. This ""smart"" movie will have them talking for ever (they thought). It actually IS a smart movie. It is also a messy one. It does need a couple of viewings, but the mess remains. Nicholas Cage is mis-cast. (having one Cage in any movie is MORE than enough.) The scenes are linked un-tidally, and I gradually began to say...O.K.---O.K. its a smart movie. But is there anything else.? The answer is...very little. It is one of those films...where...after it was completed all of the crew had a huge celebration. Some because they thought they had made a good film (they had not), and some who were just glad and relieved ..it was over. (Like i felt when the credits appeared.)"
189,Adaptation.,10,1 January 2013,Brilliantly perplexing,"A film about the screenplay which is currently being written within the film and how it ends. Phenomenal and extraordinary. The lives of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Cage), author Susan Orlean (Streep) and orchid poacher John Laroche (Cooper) become strangely intertwined as each one's search for passion collides with the others' in this adaptation of the best-selling ""The Orchid Thief."" This brilliant meta-narrative and hilarious spoof of Hollywood's formulaic approach to telling stories. ""Adaptation"" came about because of Jonze and real-life writer Kaufman, who had worked previously on ""Being John Malkovich."" Cage's sweaty, uncomfortable turn in both roles is marvelous. I miss the vintage Nicolas Cage in well made films, and his performance here still amazes me every time. Enough can't be said about the performances of a stellar cast, Strep and Cooper (won Oscar), that exceed lofty expectations. Original, clever, beautiful, tragic, and I could go on."
190,Adaptation.,8,10 October 2012,"Brilliant, offbeat comedy","Adaptation is a different concept. It tells of a screenwriter (Nicholas Cage) who tries to adapt a book into a screenplay. Unfortunately, there is nothing much going in the book and the screenwriter is supposed to add drama to make the book into a film. The alluring Tilda Swinton is behind Cage to complete the screenplay as soon as possible. The film gently slips into the past where the author Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) interacts with an orchid expert (Chris Cooper) and writes down their 'intellectual' discussions and brief trips in search of rare orchids.Cage has a twin brother who starts much after him but completes his screenplay before him and it is an instant hit. Cage suffers from the burden to catch up with his twin brother. He is also obsessed with sex and imagines it with Swinton, Streep, and many others. The film is hilarious and captivating till the last half hour where it suddenly steers into thriller genre. This sudden change might be unacceptable by some viewers but that is the central theme of Adaptation where the screenwriter has to add clichés and other regular ingredients to make it a screenplay.Meryl Streep is the lifeline of Adaptation. You can't stop laughing at the situations she gets into. She is charming as always. Chris Cooper is superb as the eccentric, sans front teethed orchid expert. Nicholas Cage is convincing in both his roles.The screenplay is the scene stealer. It is non-linear in some parts and switches back and forth so quickly that it confuses at times. The film leaves a vague impression about the book that is being adapted, and doesn't talk much of it. It only gives a brief out-sight of what it is about. Some of the lines from it are voiced-over by Streep and they are a treat to listen to. She has a mesmerizing voice.Adaptation might require multiple watches to understand, particularly because it blurs the reason to switch to thriller genre in the end. Otherwise, it is a different concept presented in a very enjoyable way."
191,Adaptation.,5,20 August 2012,A Major Flaw,"I haven't the time to read all of the reviews on this film. Someone likely already said this and many others likely refuted the suggestion, but . . . Charlie and Donald should have been the same person, plain and simple. The film has no real genius otherwise.Donald wrote a screenplay in which the main character was more than one person, a writing technique which Charlie abhorred. Once that concept was introduced and then emphasized on a number of occasions, it should have continued to play an important role. Considering how Charlie discovers that Donald has always been his better (as a person and a writer), it would stand to reason that Donald's methodologies were better too. And since Charlie was living in the screenplay he, himself, was writing, he should have decided in the end that the split personality concept was in fact a viable writing technique; and subsequently, it should have been revealed that Charlie and Donald were in fact the same person.The nonchalantness of the ending also lent itself to such a revelation. The scene where Charlie calls his mother to give her the news of Donald's death meant very little, to me at least, because we never saw Charlie's mother. The very short time (seconds in film time) in which Charlie ""recovered"" makes it seems like Donald wasn't really missed. Charlie not only recovered, but became as confident as his former brother, suggesting that it was in him all the time to be so confident. Lastly, Charlie intended at one point to make the theme of the film, more-or-less, disappointment. He suggested that nothing extraordinary need occur for someone to experience growth, but he was ""dead"" wrong.Despite all of this, there's not even the remotest possibility that Donald was an alter ego of Charlie and/or that Kaufman was using the split personality technique. Donald was definitely a ""real"" fictitious person, making the film one of my least favorites because I'll always be disappointed. And no, that does not mean that Kaufman succeeded. It's a different kind of disappointment."
192,Adaptation.,9,9 May 2012,"""From the creator of Being John Malkovich, comes the story about the creator of Being John Malkovich""","From the creator of Being John Malkovich, comes a story about the creator of John Malkovich. A story about a man who writes a screenplay from a book, that is to be adapted to a movie. A story about a woman who wrote the book, after being becoming interested in the plants. A story about a man who puts himself into the story, finding a way to ""un- Hollywoodize"" it, then shifting itself into the movie itself. A story about how a man fails and lets his ""twin brother"" into creating the story; who is filled with clichés and a big one on ""Hollywood"" plot, story, and characters. A story about writing, a story about life.Clever. I could go into the brilliant plot, writing, and directing, but that all seemed a bit useless. The only word to perfectly define the entire film is 'clever' albeit my lame attempt at doing so..I walked into the film with no expectations just like any other film I go to see. The first time, I turned it off in the first thirty minutes, finding myself in a mixture of confusion and boredom. But the second time, all seemed to come at me, as the overall brilliance was like a punch to the face..This is one of those films that an explanation completes. The second time, after finished it's bizarre nature, I was met with mixed feelings. But as I thought about, read about it, and found out the whole POINT of it, I was mesmerized. I could go right now and explain the plot, giving the whole plot synopsis, but even that would result in me jumbling words together because it is just BRILLIANT, CLEVER, ORIGINAL. So instead of just saying how good it was (which shouldn't really tell you to go see it) let's go into the specs:Nicolas Cage's acting. This right here, those third words right over there, make this film what it is. It surely proves the naysayers wrong, and proves the yaysayers right. Nicolas Cage is a wonderful actor, who may put himself in silly roles, but other films (like this one right here) can deplete that fact right there. His acting was great, especially how you see that he plays two characters. The supporting cast was also fantastic. High props to Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper.. The plot was overall just that one word you've heard before in all these identical reviews - clever. I've never seen Being John Malkovich, but the director's artistic mind and cleverly-executed sense of style can lead me right over to it. The overall film itself was a perfect example about how originality can take it's tole, and no, movies nowadays are not shallow. This is the example. The movie was also pretty hilarious in my humble opinion. Adaptation realizes that it's a satire on a writer's life and accepts that, and although that sounds a bit silly, there's so much more to compete with that fact right there. I was impressed. Adaptation has brilliant/clever acting, directing, writing, and soul. It's depth has yet to be found...But the film isn't for everybody, and I recommend for a select few who can take + understand the underlying satire this film consumes. My first impression might be yours too, but after finding out how clever the film really is, it needs to be taking accounted for. I loved it. 9/10."
193,Adaptation.,,6 March 2012,Another Kaufman gem,"I'm not sure what I expected from Adaptation. The plot itself sounded weird enough, and it being called an ""adaptation"" from a book really also intrigued me, especially because based on Kaufman's two other films (Eternal Sunshine and Synecdoche New York) I know how he likes to write... um, off the marks. But even I didn't expect this film to be as outlandish as it was.It started off pretty distant. In its first few minutes there's already a lot going on that it kinda lost me for a while there. But I got with it soon enough, and what a ride it was. One of the most self-referential films I have ever seen. In fact, sometimes it's so self-referential that you aren't even sure what's really non-fiction and what is. The third act itself is pretty great, and really goes off the charts in craziness. I can see many people not liking it, but I think it worked wonders. It goes with everything the film had pointed out prior to that.The ensemble cast is great. Nicholson is the star here of course, and he shows what he is capable of when working with a good script. Meryl Streep is also pretty fantastic, and can I say that she hits all of the character's notes perfectly? She takes a rather ""interesting"" arc throughout, and she is fantastic. I prefer her here than in her other 2002 performance in The Hours. Chris Cooper is also excellent, but worthy of an Oscar-win? Nah. Overall, I loved this one. I would say Spike Jonze deserves credit (not seen John Malkovich) and it's Kaufman's third great film. Because let's be honest, he's the main ingredient."
194,Adaptation.,8,2 December 2011,Being Charlie Kaufman.,"Just like you could expect from Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze, this is a very unique and unusual movie. It's unlike anything else, since it blends fiction with reality and features such an odd concept, that no other film-maker would had had the guts to actually turn this into a movie.It's like the movie itself is actually being made in this movie. It's about writer's Charlie Kaufman difficulties as a writer and about his attempts to turn a best selling novel, about flowers, into an actual screenplay. Instead of doing so, Kaufman came up with this movie, which is about his difficulties to come up with a screenplay for the novel. It's not like the movie is being an accurate portrayal of his writing process but instead it's an entirely fictionalized story, with even a fictionalize twin brother, Donald Kaufman, in it. Sounds too confusing? Don't worry, when watching this movie things will get much clearer to you. It might have a complex and weird premise but the way it plays out is actually very easy and accessible to follow. It's probably because the movie is such an intriguing watch, with its far from flawless characters and its originality. It has a great style and way of film-making to it, in which the story is actually being told quite slowly and subtle but the movie itself is always, pleasantly, fast paced.The movie is beautifully portraying the struggles of a writer. He gets stuck in a creative process, which is driving him into madness and desperation. But it was not like he was a very stable character to begin with. Nicolas Cage, as Charlie Kaufman, plays his character as a real loser, who is balding and having too many pounds on his belly. He's awful around women and way too shy and restrained than is good for him. It's really great to see how much Nicolas Cage put into his role. For the first and only time ever(?) he is not afraid to show his balding head on the screen. His acting even earned him an Oscar nomination.But the movie is filled with many great actors. I actually had no idea how many great ones are in it beforehand. Meryl Streep, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, these are all really some of my favorite actors. It's further more also starring the likes of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton, among others. In other words; a real solid cast!But obviously none of them would had been as great if it wasn't for Charlie Kaufman's writing. The real Charlie Kaufman that is, not the movie one. In more than one way, this really is foremost his movie. A title for this movie also easily could had been ""Being Charlie Kaufman"". I also think it's quite awesome how the fictional twin brother Donald Kaufman also received writing credits for this movie and even was nominated for an Oscar, along with his 'brother' Charlie. An example of how fiction and reality gets mixed brilliantly by this movie.Perhaps not as brilliant, weird and intriguing as ""Being John Malkovich"" but all in all, a more than successful second collaboration between Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
195,Adaptation.,,22 September 2011,One of the best films of the decade,"To say the least this movie is brilliant. I mean, just in the technical sense; the expert use of natural and artificial light, the superlative cinematography and directing-by one of the silent greats Spike Jonze- and an attention to detail that Van Gogh would envy. This movie is a knock-out, a dramatic piece of perfection. Incredibly well acted, an intriguing and unpredictable story. This is the kind of film Oscars are made of. Nic Cage is a genius of the highest caliber, effortlessly sliding between two psyches as he plays two down on their luck twins. To say that his acting is amazing would be obvious, but in the lessons of Plutarch, the obvious answer is usually the right one. Visual magnificence! To say the least it is because of films like these (among a litany of others) that I am the Nic Cage fan I am today and I can guarantee you I will be first in line to see his next great film ""Trespass"" http://on.fb.me/pchomT .I advise all who read this to check out the trailer for themselves, thanking me for the subsequent life-altering view of the world is optional."
196,Adaptation.,9,28 August 2011,Great Film,"The reason I originally chose to watch Adaptation was simply because I knew Charlie Kaufman was involved. I had finished watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind the previous evening, and thought i'd give this a shot. Sure enough, it was fantastic. An interesting little movie, and sure to be of great entertainment of anyone who likes a good ol' fashioned original screenplay. The main character, incidentally Charlie Kaufman himself, is characterized as an awkward, socially inept individual who is determined to adapt the Orchid Thief into a screenplay. The movie itself is full of interesting themes. It's got that dark comedy feel to it, and gives you no choice but to sympathize with the protagonist from minute one. It's a funny, interesting, and tragic film. And I love it. If you've seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind, or Being John Malkovich and enjoyed that style of film, you'll love this."
197,Adaptation.,7,12 August 2011,An Adaptation and Then Some,"Charlie Kaufman's film ADAPTATION provides no easy answers. Blending the line between fact and fiction, he gives us, through the brilliant lens of Spike Jonze, a contemplative look at art and the artists that make it. ADAPTATION is, in very obvious ways, about the creation of itself, and therefore it sheds light on the act of creation on a broader scale, one that Kaufman writes brilliantly, Jonze captures brilliantly, and is acted brilliantly by Meryl Streep, Nicholas Cage (in his best performance) and Chris Cooper. Since you feel that the movie is shaping itself as it goes along, it not only takes twists and turns that you can actively feel happening, but pulls us all into an intimate and thoughtfully enlightening experience, to say the least. Cage plays real-life screenplay writer Kaufman with such ho-hum self-degradation that it establishes Charlie as someone struggling to understand (to adapt to, to bring to life) the story that the audience is watching. The result is fascinating. Kaufman, the character, is given a suggestion for an ending to his story and that's the ending that Kaufman, the writer, writes and presents. It's the only film to present writer's block as something worthwhile and interesting, most likely because there is more to it than just that. The situation explores and criticizes the current state of Hollywood, given the restrictions on artistic integrity in loo of more crowd-pleasing and dollar-raking fare. The ironic genius of it all, is that Kaufman writes the very story he criticizes; he gives us that ending, he uses narrative voice-overs, he questions the passions of his Kaufman character, essentially questioning himself. It is very much a film about passion, and why people need passions, why we need something to adapt to for our brief time on Earth to make it into time well spent. Kaufman, the writer, certainly does this by the juxtaposition of the other story line, featuring Streep and Cooper as novelist Susan Orlean and her lover (?), which feeds off of the essence of nonfiction wonder just as much as Kaufman's story does on the nature of artistic creation. You feel both Cooper and Streep's passions, and that may very well be why they are written to be lovers, when in the real world, that was probably not the case. It begs the question of whether art is real or not, a question that Christopher Nolan also tackled in his INCEPTION. Kaufman straddles that line intelligently, never giving easy answers, but always allowing for some engaging discussion. Through Kaufman's metaphysical psychologically involved approach, this becomes one of the best screenplays ever written. Is it the best movie ever made? No, but maybe it never really tries to be more than what it is, which is to say: genius. A-"
198,Adaptation.,,6 August 2011,Charlie Kaufman adapts screenplay about adapting a screenplay. An original movie at its best.,"Rating: 8.5/10Adaptation follows the story of Charlie Kaufman, a Hollywood screenwriter who wants to be original and not follow all those Hollywood clichés. He one day was hired to adapt a nonfiction book called The Orchid Thief by Susan Orleans into a screenplay. The book's about John Laroche who is passionately in love with plants and flowers. As Charlie struggles with his adaptation, he turns to his less talented brother, Donald Kaufman, who is easy-going and doesn't take everything too seriously.However, the plot of this movie is much more than that. In the real world, the real Charlie Kaufman was asked to adapt Susan Orleans's The Orchid Thief and this film is basically what Charlie Kaufman came up with. He makes himself the main character and creates a fictional twin brother, Donald Kaufman. It was very interesting to see how this film would play out. And it did not disappoint.As for performances in this film, Nicholas Cage turned out to be surprisingly good. I wasn't sure at first. But this has to be one of his finest roles to date. He portrayed both Charlie and Donald with such emotions and both of their emotions are completely opposite. Charlie is most of the time depressed and sad while Donald is living the time of life, learning as he goes along. I read somewhere on the internet that Nic Cage ignored all his acting instincts and played the part as the director asked him to. Maybe if he did that in every movie he stars in, we would have more good movies from Nicholas CageMeryl Streep stars as Susan Orlean , a lonely writer looking for something to be passionately in love about. She then writes a book about John Loroche, played by Chris Cooper, who has a passion for flowers. Susan Orlean writes about John's life while not being able to live her own. They both did a great job portraying these characters especially Chris Cooper who won an Oscar for his portrayal of John Laroche. This movie is a hard one to criticize. Most of the film, we get to experience the way Charlie Kaufman lives. It was slow, boring, and depressing. Until that last act came, where Charlie seeks the help of Donald, the movie then suddenly gets faster and falls into a whole lot of Hollywood clichés which is the way Donald would adapt his screenplay. Basically the film was separated into two parts, the first is the Charlie part, slow and depressing, and the Donald part, fast, silly, over the top, and sometimes fun.It was hard for me to truly enjoy the movie. It was too slow at times and too fast at times. There was nothing in the middle. But I think this is the way the writer, Charlie Kaufman, wanted his film to be; to be a parody of big Hollywood blockbusters. Although, it was hard for me to enjoy this movie, the movie had a huge impact on me; the message the film is sending and the characters in this movie. Everything is so intriguing and thought provoking. The theme and sub themes of this movie are so intriguing that I didn't even care if I enjoyed the movie. I was fascinated by the real Charlie Kaufman, the way he chose to write his movie. He is a genius. This script is purely original. Charlie is so absorbed into searching for meaning, purpose, structure, and recognition that he forgets to actually live. He analyzes life. He thinks about what he should do in situations but doesn't have the courage to do it. While Susan tried to see why John is so passionate about these flowers, but in the end, she just found that it was meaningless to her.I think what the movie is trying to say is it was meaningless to find the ghost orchid. The ghost orchid symbolizes the goal of any passionate life. However, Susan's ghost orchid wasn't about flowers. There are different ""ghost orchid"" for everyone. And to find the ghost orchid, it must come from out heart. You are what you love not what loves you. There is always someone in the world that you want to be. You don't want to be your old boring self as Charlie turns to his twin brother and loses his originality. Donald then adapts his book the way he would have adapted. This film is also about being true to yourself, be proud about who you are as everybody is different and unique in their own ways. You are the main character in your life, not anybody else. But to be true to yourself is often times a hard thing to do. There is always someone or something that will want to hold you down. The writer of this movie symbolizes this by creating the character of Donald. In my opinion, Donald represents the demands of Hollywood. As it is so hard to be original in Hollywood these days, writers and directors just cave in and turn into a clichéd and boring film maker who makes movies for money. As I mentioned, the film has so many heartfelt themes and sub-themes. It had an impact on me after watching the film. But the fact still remains, I didn't enjoy this movie while watching the movie. I did enjoy it to a certain extent, but not that much. I guess you can't have your cake and eat it too. I wasn't able to enjoy both the message of the film and the actual film. But all in all, Adaptation is still a solid, well directed, and certainly well-written film. It's an original piece of work by Charlie Kaufman. I urge you to see all of Charlie Kaufman's written work and directorial work. He is one of the remaining filmmakers in the industry that is still original today."
199,Adaptation.,,13 July 2011,deus ex machina,"So I saw 2002's award winning Adaptation directed by the creative Spike Jonze and written by the even more creative Charlie Kaufman. So is it good, yes it is extremely good. This movie has one of the most creative plots I have ever seen in any movie. This is not surprising considering the writer (Charlie Kaufman) or should I say writers, as both him and his imaginary twin Donald were both nominated for the academy award for best adapted screen play (something they lost which in my estimation is one of the greatest crimes committed by Oscar). So I mention Donald Kaufman, who is not a real person, so how does he factor into the movie. Well that is just it, I don't know if Charlie was approached about adapting Susan Orlean's book, ""the orchid thief"" and had difficulty writing it and decided to fictionalize the non fiction book, or if he just came up with the concept, but he took a nonfiction book and made it a fantasy of sorts. That is where the imaginary Donald comes into play. The story revolves around Charlie as he becomes increasingly frustrated about writing the screenplay while his twin brother (Donald) takes a screen writing work shop, and knocks out a hit movie that is very superficial and ""popcorn"" in nature. This dichotomy which is part of the movie industry, where the artist wants to be true to his art, while the pressures of delivering a hit and the formulaic plots that often get movie scripts green lit is explored. Charlie is an artist and Donald maybe represents that part of Charlie that feels like selling out to make a good payday (something you can debate for yourself). This plays out while the real story of Orlean and her subject John Laroche (played by Chris Cooper who won best supporting actor) plays out at first in the background. The movie continues to follow Charlie as he becomes increasingly frustrated and Donald becomes increasingly successful. Then the movie takes a purposeful twist. The movie even tells us it is taking the twist. It announces the plot twist before it happens, calls it by name, deus ex machina, a plot device whereby a seemingly inextricable problem is suddenly and abruptly solved with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object. So it announces it and all of a sudden we find ourselves in a sex and drug filled thriller where the lives of Charlie, Donald, Laroche, and Orlean crash together both literally and figuratively. So this movie is crazy insane, brilliantly written, beyond original, and extremely well acted. So is this movie for everyone, well NO! This movie is for indy lovers and the more creative thinkers among us. If transformers is your favorite movie this might now be a flick for you. However, I simply adored it. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"
200,Adaptation.,8,24 May 2011,Quirky... A bit too long... But enjoyable...,"I went into watching this without really knowing much about it. I knew who was starring in it and I knew it had picked up some awards. Other than that I really didn't know very much about it at all. Having seen it and having done a little research I can see why it has got the notoriety it has. It's a very clever plot that's quite quirky but always keeps the audience engaged and guessing what the next twist will be. Of course Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman are the pair behind the excellent (IMO) 1999 film, Being John Malkovich.OK, to the plot You may recognise one or two character names here. Charlie Kaufman is a bit of a timid individual who happens to be quite a successful screenwriter. He has been commissioned to adapt a book by Susan Orlean called ""The Orchid Thief"". The trouble is, he's finding it almost impossible to adapt. To add to his pain, his twin brother, Donald, who is much more outgoing, has decided he wants to be a screenwriter too. He has some great ideas and is always pestering Charlie just when he's struggling with his work. We are told (by flashback) the story of ""The Orchid Thief"", an individual known as John Laroche who lives in Florida and makes a living from taking rare plants, particularly orchids, from the various parks and reserves in the area. It may seem that there isn't much to get your teeth into here, but believe me, that's just the bare bones of it. I really don't want to say too much more, I believe it's best if you watch this one for yourself.As I said at the beginning, this is quite a quirky film with quite a few plot twists. I found it very enjoyable, if a little too long. It's topped off by two great performances; firstly from Nicolas Cage who plays both Charlie and Donald Kaufman, he is really excellent. Secondly, we have Chris Cooper as John Laroche who really earned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (IMO). Also of note was Meryl Streep as Susan Orlean, I thought she was pretty good without being stretched too much. There was a small part for Maggie Gyllenhaal as Donald's love interest, Caroline Cunningham, and it was nice to see a brief cameo from Brian Cox as screen writing guru, Robert McKee.I quite enjoyed this quirky comedy/drama, it kept be interested all the way through and I found it quite entertaining. I did feel it was a little too long and tended to drag a bit towards the end. Other than that, a fine piece of work with a very clever plot and one I have no problem in recommending to you.My Score: 7.5/10"
201,Adaptation.,10,29 April 2011,Done with fish,"Charlie Kaufman, struggling with the adaptation of a non-fiction book about orchids, goes off on a bizarre tangent that ends up with him writing himself into the script. Along with a made-up twin brother. And a third act that is not in the source book that Michael Bay would be proud of. It is, as Kaufman tells us, pathetic and narcissistic.It is also genius.Films about making films tend not to travel well, functioning mostly as industry in-jokes that can leave non-aficionados cold. In this meandering collage, Kaufman manages to achieve three things - explore the big theme in the source book of how to live an original life, contemplate the challenges and self-loathing inherent in a screenwriter's existence, and pull off an entertaining and truly cathartic film. Writing guru Robert McKee (an exuberant Brian Cox) tells Kaufman to pay off in the third act, which he duly does, as if in way off apology for the navel-gazing that has gone before. The fact that the apology is signposted (and unnecessary - or was it tongue-in-cheek?), then rendered redundant by virtue of the fact that we are utterly drawn into the third act, is simply incredible. Don't even try to count the layers at work here.Donald Kaufman is one of the great characters of cinema history. Cage plays both brothers in a blinding display of acting range (and trick photography...). With Streep and Cooper in attendance, there was never any fear of acting letting the project down. Startling and peerless, Adaptation may just be the best film about filmmaking ever."
202,Adaptation.,7,7 March 2011,Not like anything I've seen in a while.,"""There are too many ideas and things and people. Too many directions to go. I was starting to believe the reason it matters to care passionately about something, is that it whittles the world down to a more manageable size.""What a unique movie. I honestly don't have much of an idea how to review it, it's so rambling, expansive, and hard to categorize. On the surface, it's about a shy, socially- inhibited screenwriter who is struggling to write an adaptation of a book. You'll soon see that Adaptation is much more ambitious and ""meta"" than that. I did like it, though. To say that I'm not generally a fan of Nicholas Cage would be an understatement, but he occasionally shines in movies like these. Offbeat, ""different"" movies where his quirkiness translates well to the subject material.I think it's safe to say that fans of Charlie Kaufman's other work will enjoy this. It's undoubtedly an intelligent movie that requires an open mind and an affinity for new film experiences."
203,Adaptation.,8,25 February 2011,A movie about the creative process in writing,"A thought-provoking humorous movie about the creative process in writing. The storyline tells the story of the struggle of Charlie Kaufman, the scriptwriter of this movie, to adapt for the big screen a book by Susan Orlean on her investigation on a quirky weird collector of strange varieties of orchids. The movie shows, at the same time, the story of the writing of the book by Orlean, the story of the writing of the script by Kaufman, the movie resulting of that script, and how the gaps in the book were filled both in the process of writing the script and in the film itself. It sounds confusing, but the direction and editing are terrific and this a very easy to follow film. To put it in a simple way, this is a Magritte-like film, with a man painting himself painting himself painting himself repeated several times.A few familiar elements characteristic to Kaufman's scripts are also present in this film: 1/ Different narrative times, past and present, reality and fiction. Here, the transitions are clearly marked with captions indicating the period to which they belong, so the movie is truly easy to follow despite moving back and forwards from reality to fiction and vice versa, and from past to present and vice versa. 2/ To narrate the story trough actors and directors who are portrayed as themselves but in fictional situations. 3/ The interest for Nature, as a concept and its meaning. In this case, plants in general, and orchids in particular, are the catalytic of the story.This is a movie would be worthy of the best Woody Allen as Kaufman halves his personality in two: Charlie and his invented twin Donald. Charlie depicts himself as a fat neurotic, insecure, asocial semi-bold man, full of fears and insecurities. Dan, is the cheery version of himself - the most organized, secure and attractive guy, flirty with girls, who puts order and structure where there is chaos and anxiety. Kaufman deprecates himself, mocks himself and his fame and importance in a very lovable way. The halving of his personality also shows how the creative process in writing operates differently when you are writing from scratch (Donald) and when you are adapting somebody else's story (Charlie).The acting is truly terrific. Chris Cooper is outstanding and completely believable (almost unrecognizable) as John Laroche, a passionate weird orchid collector. Cage has his mojo back with his double performance of Charlie and Donald; the characterization is identical but for the dressing and weight, and mostly because Cage's acting is great and makes us believe that there are two twins where there is just one actor; I think Cage is specially good at depicting Charlie's inner loser. Meryl Street is OK in her role of reputed journalist Susan Orlean with a posh boring life, in a role that is a little bit daring and crazy sometimes. Meryl Streep was interested in the movie and she offered herself for the role before the casting even started, and not only that, she lowered her salary not to blow up the film's budget and be part of it There are other non credited actors in the movie, who appear briefly in it, and also famous secondary actors: Tilda Swinton and Maggie Gyllenhall are delightful and so beautiful in their respective mini-roles. One can understand why people of the film industry would be interested in it, as it depicts their world and métier with realism and creativity at the same time.I think that anybody who has written professionally or academically can identify with the pain and excitement that sometimes writing is. In that regard, I especially liked when Charlie sat in front of his typing machine for the first time, and his mind easily deviated to coffee and muffins, to anything less painful than facing a sheet of paper in blank with you having nothing to say.The movie has sometimes been accused of pretentious, but this is, to me, not pretentious at all. Creative writing and writing in general is really hard work, especially if you are working for Hollywood. I think the movie is very honest, very personal and cathartic for Kaufman, and a jewel for the viewer as Kaufman's craftsmanship is honestly dissected for the benefit of the viewer, in a very simple and intelligible way.The reflection on nature is the most mixed-up part, to me. On one hand, we humans are part of Nature and, in that regard, subject to the same natural laws as plants are, for example. Plants and flowers evolve by adaptation, and humans did so too. Adaptation for humans is defined in the film as ""the way how we thrive in this world"" which is a wonderful definition and principle. How the characters in the movie thrive in their respective world is not that clear, as they are a mess in their life most of the time, and there is no thriving, just surviving.I did not enjoy the end because doesn't hear the inner voice of the characters. In one of the scenes of the movie, Charlie, very anxious, asks creative writing guru Robert McKee for advice as he doesn't know how to end his script; McKee tells him to follow the character's intention and personality, to be true to it to make it believable, whatever turns you give to the character. I think that's a great advice - internal logic. The problem is that the movie fails in doing so once the brothers decide to investigate Orlean and go to Miami, and the story gets really crazy and non-believable at all. To me, this part is really an abrupt rupture that rests brilliance and does not give an harmonic closure to the film.A great movie. It won't speak to everybody, though."
204,Adaptation.,7,30 April 2010,It comes apart in the end.  But maybe that's the point.,"You can't really expect Charlie Kaufman, screenwriter of Being John Malkovich, to write a simple, straightforward, easily comprehensible movie can you? Where's the fun in that? His Malkovich partner in crime Spike Jonze directs again and adds his own unique touches to the project. Once again this rather unique pair of collaborators entertain us and throw us completely for a loop while doing so. Are they being serious? Are they just messing with our minds? Does it really even matter?Adaptation is a movie, written by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, about screenwriter Charlie Kaufman writing a movie. Yes it is, at least at times, as confusing as it sounds. The line between truth and fiction is not just blurred, it's completely obliterated. It's a simple story really. Charlie's trying to write a movie. Charlie's really struggling to write said movie. But that in and of itself doesn't sound like much of a movie so we veer off into a kind of bizarro world which seems to be the specialty of the real Charlie Kaufman. And the movie version of Charlie Kaufman gets caught up in it. Along with his twin brother Donald. Wait, Charlie Kaufman has a twin brother? Why of course he does, he's even credited as co-writer of the movie. The real movie. Adaptation. Not the fake movie fake Charlie's trying to write. Fake Donald's writing his own fake movie. Real Donald? Don't ask. My head hurts.Adaptation is helped along by some truly outstanding performances. Playing both Charlie and Donald, twins who could not be any more dissimilar, was obviously going to be a challenge and Nicolas Cage is up to the task. It's a reminder that Cage can do excellent work when he has the material to work with and is not just cashing a paycheck in some mindless blockbuster film. Meryl Streep is just as perfect as you would expect Meryl Streep to be in portraying a writer who sets the whole plot in motion by writing a book about orchids. That's the book which Charlie is trying to adapt into a screenplay. No wonder he's having trouble writing it, a movie about orchids? Chris Cooper has the other major role, portraying a rather unique orchid thief. Bringing this bizarre character to life earned Cooper an Academy Award and rightfully so. Cage, Streep and Cooper have the big parts but a succession of fine performers in a wide and varied cast all do excellent work. It really is a wonderfully acted movie.The seemingly simple plot which ends up being incredibly complex makes for a fascinating movie. For the first two-thirds of the movie you can't help but think you're watching a work of genius. However in the final act it all falls apart. But wait, that may be just part of the genius. That was Charlie's point. The real Charlie I mean, fake Charlie's just along for the ride by this point. The movie had to fall apart in the end. Fake Charlie even told you it would. All the Hollywood contrivances fake Charlie rails against as he tries to write his fake movie will be used by the real Charlie to wrap up the real movie. It's a terrible ending. But it's supposed to be a terrible ending. Even if you appreciate the bizarre genius at work you can't help but be a touch disappointed in the end though. After such a great setup it's somewhat of a letdown. But it's the right ending, the only ending, for this movie. It really is a shame this movie didn't win the Oscar for best screenplay. Seeing Charlie and Donald accept their award would have been...interesting."
205,Adaptation.,10,4 April 2009,Sweetest Perfection,"Nicholas Cage seems to involve himself in almost as many bad films as good ones. However, ADAPTATION, is much more than good- it is brilliant! Charlie Kaufman (SYNECHDOCE,NEW YORK/ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND) wrote the movie, and he elicits a unique almost playful autobiographical tone. The narrative concerns a screen writer who struggles to adapt a book about flowers into a feature length Hollywood feature. And, the film becomes a movie about the making of this movie. ADAPTATION features twin brothers (surrealistically portrayed by Cage), a man with no front teeth, and Meryl Streep. Dazzling in scope and reach. This film is hilarious, insightful, and thought provoking simultaneously. ADAPTATION creates a magical realism of the highest order, and is A Must See."
206,Adaptation.,8,6 November 2008,"Uniquely chaotic, sharp, and maddening...","ADAPTATION. explores the complexity and difficulty of writing a screenplay based on a novel that, well, has no 'real' story, in a uniquely weird and enjoyable way. The movie is not only about the adaptation of a novel into a screenplay, but also about human beings adapting to the various events that occur in their lives. Spike Jonze has a penchant for weirdness and that comes across quite strongly here, as he even features his deliciously weird BEING JOHN MALKOVICH in a cameo in this film.Nicolas Cage produces one of his best performances since LEAVING LAS VEGAS as he portrays the aging, out-of-shape, balding, awkward, sociopathic writer (and his 'twin brother') given the task of adapting while searching for (or rather craving) originality. If it were not for Adrien Brody's standout performance in THE PIANIST, Cage could have well picked up his second Oscar. Meryl Streep is exceptional and reliable as the writer looking for passion in her life. For me, the real star in this film is Chris Cooper, who gives the performance of a lifetime as the delusional environment-loving Laroche. It should be noted here that Cooper indeed managed to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.It would have been wonderfully ironic if ADAPTATION. had won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar, but it was deservedly beaten by THE PIANIST. ADAPTATION. is clever (though some may argue a bit too clever, and self-indulgent at times) and witty, and the strong performances by Cage, Streep, and Cooper are mildly reminiscent of AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Even hours after my first viewing of this movie, I still wasn't sure what to make of it as it is one of those films that takes a bit longer than most to digest.In the end, the movie is deserving of 3.5 stars (out of 4) and an overall rating of 8/10. I recommend seeing this at least once, if only for the superb acting and bizarre storyline. Should enter my Top 200 at about #179."
207,Adaptation.,10,28 August 2008,"This movie is not just Cinema, it is Art In Motion with exceedingly superb Dialogue.","I am not going to jump into the many loves I have for this film. I don't have the time and I am not a crafty writer. I personally find it hard to put into the words the pure ""Talent"" of this masterpiece, that I don't think my words would capture the essence of it's genius. This Masterpiece has so many different angles and gives you so many different views that it left me contemplating and analyzing days after watching it just to truly understand every angle and idea and truth this movie presents. And it presents many. So I will just leave you will this. This movie is Art in motion, from the Acting to the Dialogue, to the overpowering Directing. If you love Art, you'll love this movie."
208,Adaptation.,8,13 August 2008,Ignore McKee; don't judge by the ending,"Extremely profound, yet deeply self-indulging at times, Adaptation is difficult movie to explain. It is an easier watch than some of the other Charlie Kaufman's scripts as the story gravitates toward real life than the surreality that exists in Kaufman's writing. Adaptation, for the most parts, effortlessly blends the writer's own story with that of a superficial lifeless book about an orchid thief that intertwines with the life of the book's writer. While it may sound like confusing concept for a movie, the parallels between the story lines are well drawn. For about three-quarters of the movie, the story is tautly focused on the protagonist's writer's block and his less than adequate social life. These are the best moments in the film. The film takes a dramatic and a more mundane turn toward the end as the director, understandably, wants to drag it toward a ending with a moral. While the ending may be a letdown, it is hard to find fault with the movie simply for not being profound in the end. Ignore a little bit of self-indulgence and some tacky scenes in the end, the movie is well worth a watch."
209,Adaptation.,8,8 July 2008,The Screeplay Rocks,"A fat, balding, struggling screenplay writer wants to write a UN Hollywood type screenplay of the book The Orchid Thief. This Nicolas Cage movie is the most original movie with the most brilliant screenplay I have ever seen in the silver screen.The twin brothers, both talented are poles apart in ideas and ideals. While Charlie is the brainy type which also seems to make his character very reserved, unsocial. He not able to kiss his date summarizes his character. Donald isn't famous, but lives a cool life. He begins to write a screenplay typically Hollywood that annoys Charlie. He flirts with girls and is a total contrast to his twin. I believe Cage has a twin brother!!! How could he so superbly act both the characters?Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) wants to an interview John (Chris Cooper). His life has been a history of adventures. His obsession of orchids especially the Ghost Orchid makes Susan obsessed too. Susan brings out a book -The Orchid Thief, based on her relationship with John and the orchids.Now Charlie isn't able to finish his screenplay because the book ends non- melodramatically, how he does that, remaining true to the book and the characters forms the movie.Watch out for the scenes that are educative- The whole earth's evolution in a span of seconds, The Orchid and insect lovemaking- pollination.The movie seems so surreal, almost biographical with the characters drawn from real life that I am not able to differentiate the borderline between the movie, the book, the movie screenplay. forget it, I have written enough. Please watch it the screenplay I repeat is fabulous, so is the acting."
210,Adaptation.,7,10 June 2008,"Good, not great.","I had high expectations for this film. During exposition, I really thought I'd love it. I loved Charlie's quirkiness. But the movie had a hard time holding my attention, or rather, keeping me very interested, after about halfway through. Part of the movie's charm is it's subtly, yes. But at times if seems to drag too much, even though it's not trying to achieve the same effect that a fast moving, steady building film does. It just feels like it kind of stalls out at times. As charming as Charlie is with his insecurities, at times it can become slightly old. Also, near the climactic ending scene in the swamp, the outcome is a bit stupid and unfulfilling in my opinion. Even though I've complained a lot, overall, this film is much smarter than your average. The cinematography is nice. Acting is good, especially from Cage. It just may be a bit boring for some, even those who prefer subtle, nuanced movies. Worth a view though, for sure."
211,Adaptation.,9,9 April 2008,The movie you're waiting for is here,"I believe It was one of the best movies I've ever seen,The movie Entitled ""adaptation"" and it really fits for this movie as the adaptation means process of making one thing fit another,Initial scenes are astonishing,as it shows a good procedure of adapting(expressing the whole world in an adaptation process).So I adore the general idea in the film and I admire the whole package all together. Nicolas Cage was really great playing in two roles one as a cynical screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and the other as his twin(!!!) brother as a simple ordinary writer (one of his brilliant acting shows just like ""leaving Las vegas""). Meryl Streep also was shining like always,acting as an addicted and also pay attention to the ""Orchid"" flower as a symbol in this movie. Another view about this movie is the story of a writer-a screenwriter-which came to this idea finally that Everyone should live in his own way,-""I knew that But I love Sarah just because of herself,even Sarah couldn't get her from me""- So It's really worth to see this nice and excellent movie, you'll discover more by trying to take a good look and thinking good about this movie, then see it and enjoy."
212,Adaptation.,9,26 March 2008,"""You Are What You Love,Not What Loves You""","I literally just finished watching this film. From The moment it began to the amazing way it ended, I was astonished. I never thought that after I saw 'Eternal Sunshine' that Charlie Kaufman had done a better film than that. 'Eternal Sunshine' was my favorite film of all time just a few short hours ago, but now i'd have to say that 'Adaptation.' takes the cake. Its such a brilliantly acted film, great dialogue , and has to be one of the greatest scripts ever written. Charlie Kaufman is an absolute genius and, as an aspiring screenwriter myself, I find him to be one of my biggest influences. This is just a perfect film that has so many metaphors and will be analyzed years from now for it's perfect depiction of a man searching for the answers of life that many of us also search for.Perfect film."
213,Adaptation.,8,25 March 2008,2002's best movie. Charlie Kauffman's best!,"We all know of Charlie Kauffman, the screenwriter. We all are very aware of how he is able to make situations come alive and create an Oscar-contending script every time. Being John Malcovich was brilliant. After Adaptation he wrote the film that finally got him his well-deserved Oscar, Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind. But Adaptation is my favorite of his films. It is definitely in my top ten list. It is there because I thought to myself: ""This is a character study of one of the most neurotic genius' in the world. Nicholas Cage, Meyrl Streep and Chris Cooper with tour de force performances, that earned the supporting character ""John Laroach"" an Academy Award for his role. The story is a startling, funny, touching, brilliant and all around thought-provoking multi-character character study that basically chronicles the extreme hardships that Charlie Kauffman endured when adapting the book ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan Orlene (Meyrl Streep). But when not all goes as planned, and Kauffman is blank for ideas, he goes to his ""what you see is what you get"" twin brother who, like so many people, is just looking to have fun. His brother is a screenwriter as well, but he is more of a aspiring writer who has succumbed to the seduction of Hollywood. With the adept cast giving some of their best performances, the innovative, hugely funny story that opens the eyes to viewers all over the world to the torture that is the creative process. When finishing the movie ""Being John Malcovich"" Charlie Kauffman jumps at the opportunity to start another film. But the book that he is considering adapting is opening his eyes and mind to the world around him, and how his utter lack of self respect and confidence is what is driving him to this new low. The characters are believable and the plot easily read by even the most novice of viewers. The major voice in the film is Kauffman's. He is saying that he doesn't want to make his movies into cleche Hollywood movies, and he doesn't want his life to seem like a fake, ordinary and blatant to people, especially woman. When not creating an ocean of sweat around him, he is making bad jokes and creating an awkward position for him and the woman. Now the plot has nothing to be desired, the story is true, and little does Kauffman know, many men suffer from the same symptoms as him. And the film's pivotal moment is divided into small, subtle addings that make you feel like crying. Cage makes you feel like you actually know Kauffman, Streep is in yet another fine role, and Cooper is literally perfect as Laroache, the devient and deep character who people like to study and judge, but who Orlean wants to actually know personally. I don't want to spoil anything, but basically the movie is a script that has every element and emotion blended to make a delicious and raw look at what Hollywood would make life, if only screenwriter's could keep it on the screen, rather then spread it around. To open, the paranoid Charlie Kauffman goes on a rant on a blank screen, displaying major credits. And the themes, like in life, are established without flaw. The end, is perfection. A close-up of a flower (which is what Kauffman wanted, but then never could do, was to show the world how beautiful flowers actually are) and playing ""So happy together"", a song that His brother suggested should be put in the film earlier, and Kauffman driving off thinking he knows how to finish the script. Funny."
214,Adaptation.,8,7 March 2008,Original & Clever,I must start by saying that I love Kaufmanns scripts as you always get something something completely different.I feel this is as close to the opposite of a blockbuster popcorn movie as you can get. I would recommend to watch this without reading the plot as knowing this in advance takes away from the film. It can be difficult watching but if you stick with it the plot reveals itself. Nicholas Cage is very good & shows a rare glimpse that he really can act.If you liked Kaufmanns previous work you should watch this. If you like being challenged & seeing something different then give it a go too.The only criticism I could add is maybe it is too clever?Watched this again many years after first time & I now have new found respect for this film. The ending makes even more sense & also much easier to piece all the knowing comments throughout. Don't judge this until you have watched it twice!
215,Adaptation.,,4 February 2008,lots of elements effectively combined make for good storytelling,"The oddball crew that created the wildly innovative Being John Malkovich return with this zany, insightful story about a screenwriter with a bad case of writer's block. Milquetoast writer Charlie Kaufman is given the difficult assignment of adapting a book written by a best-selling author. Out of good options or ideas, he consults his reckless twin brother Donald, then has his life turned upside down when he inadvertently writes himself into his screenplay. A smart, original story that effectively explores the Hollywood writing process, but more importantly the fundamentals of human nature with terrific performances, and characters whose motives and actions seem utterly real. Cage is brilliant in a dual role as the timid Charlie and his compulsive brother Donald, aided by Streep and Cooper who are both superb. ***"
216,Adaptation.,8,6 January 2008,Great actors,"This is a great movie if we take into consideration the first hour. Yes, we have all understood that the end of the movie was supposed to be a satire of the Hollywood type....the two brothers working together and giving different views upon the subject....but...I think that's what spoils its beauty. Anyway, Nicholas Cage does a great job and proves to be a great actor playing both the bold, sad, shy Charlie Kaufman and the eccentric, a bit silly, always laughing Donald Kaufman. Meryl Streep is absolutely great in the first part of the movie but....what a change in the second part.....the quiet, soft, sad Susan Orlean transforming into a psychotic killer? C'mon! Anyway, the director did a great job, the first 15 minutes are absolutely great and new for the cinema. I have never seen such a great sequence showing the appearance of life on earth, the world at its beginnings."
217,Adaptation.,7,20 November 2007,"Inspiring, Meditative and Tentative, ""Adaptation"" Seizes Personal Perception and Illustrates Complex Egoism","Charlie Kaufman is a screenwriter who I have always considered egotistical, yet one film showed me how addictively clever and intelligently humorous the man can be. His ability to craft highly original and often deconstructed narratives is an admirable talent, but something of an acquired taste. The most famous of his critically acclaimed screenplays was Being John Malkovich, which did nothing except infuriate me. I then saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, a film I absolutely loathed from start to finish. Thankfully, a friend bought me the DVD of Adaptation, something I unexpectedly began to admire only minutes into my initial viewing. Famous music-video director Spike Jonze (who also directed Being John Malkovich) reunited with Kaufman once again for Adaptation; the result was an invigorating blow to the senses.Adaptation is an exceptionally personal film for Kaufman, since it was written as ""therapy"" due to his own struggle of dealing with writer's block. While attempting to adapt a best-selling novel (""The Orchid Thief"") Kaufman encounters the inability to find a relationship with the convoluted material which seems to echo his own troubled feelings. Little does Kaufman realise that the familiarity with the eccentric material is what is blinding him from being able to adapt it. From here, Kaufman begins to indulge in his self-loathing, cynical and neurotic nature. It is only as Kaufman begins to doubt his craftsmanship that he becomes considerably more aware of his surroundings, and how he as with every human- relies on something, let it be memories, people or inanimate objects.In this half-biopic, fictionalised account of Kaufman's struggle, he essentially argues that we are all pretentious to a certain degree. This is an idea which I disagree with, as notions of grandeur and pretension block the ability to comprehend, something which is shown in the film, resulting in the concept being contradictory. Nonetheless, everything in the film is scrutinized beyond recognition, showing just how intricate each person's life truly is. Edited in a scrambled, jolty manner and ridden with back-and-fourth cutting, Adaptation is by no means a generic, clichéd example of modern, American cinema.Befuddling storytelling, and crammed with enough ideas for an entire series of films, it is tricky business not being able to admire the film from a writer's standpoint. Nicholas Cage performs in multiple roles (once again, see it to believe it) and executes a noteworthy performance, which maintains a sensitive level of honesty and dissatisfaction. Chris Cooper captures the wild eccentricities of his wacky character and further proves his versatility at being cast in mentally demanding roles. In fact, it is his finest performance to-date and the acting highlight of the picture. Meryl Streep is the embodiment of loneliness, spiritual awakening and reliance on others.Sometimes dreadfully confusing, but always fascinating, Adaptation is a triumph of wisdom, originality and sharp wit. If like me, you are not a fan of Kaufman or Jonze, at least give this understandably questionable outing a chance. You might just be surprised at what you find. Recommended viewing for those who question life's endless happenings, such viewers will be in for a treat."
218,Adaptation.,,27 October 2007,Loserama,"Again, not sure why this movie garnered so much attention but scared by the thought that it appealed to a large audience who might think the same way. People in this movie are unpleasant and ultimately ignorant,self absorbed and in pathetic and unsuccessful states of transition. They wend their way with very little to go on, running in the small circles the ignorant are condemned to run and hitting all the pitfalls and signposts of pathetic and denuded western material culture.(Falling in love will save me, success is paramount, etc, etc, etc.) Every item of existential dogma is trotted out in desperation by this screenplay and was very hard to stomach when it came from ALL characters, that no single character seemed to have had the basic wherewithal to speak plainly and from some depth or experience. Kaufman had decided that the whole world was as lost as he was and painted it that way. This is not realistic nor is it visionary or even clever. Nor should anyone be forced to watch. If unredemptive bleakness is an art form, then Kaufman has hit the mark. It bears all the hallmarks of serious addictive illness in the writer and would definitely make sense to the chemically dependent, which by the way is almost all of Hollywood and the voting members of the academy."
219,Adaptation.,9,16 October 2007,Adaptation.,"""Adaptation."" is a mix of fiction and fictive reality. The writer of this wonderfully imaginative screenplay is Charlie Kaufman, the man who also wrote the screenplays to ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". This story is so cleverly devised (without being pretentious and annoying) it astonishes me over and over again. He tells about the difficulties of writing, makes fun of writing clichés and in the end uses them himself, but of course ironically. Many screenwriters can't handle irony, but Kaufman uses it to perfection and writes an extremely funny and touching movie. And on top of that, I just have the feeling that these are real people that I'm watching on screen. Amazing! The direction is held by Spike Jonze again and he feeds the ideas on paper with creative images. The acting is top-notch. Nicolas Cage is perfect in his double role, Meryl Streep great as always and Chris Cooper won his Oscar absolutely deservedly. A real standout for me also was Brian Cox as the screen writing-guru Robert McKee."
220,Adaptation.,10,9 October 2007,Get it?,"'Adaptation.' is a wonderfully intelligent piece of film that starts off perfectly but sometimes gets swallowed by its own parody, mainly during the third act. Intentional or not -you gotta hook 'em in the third act, the rest doesn't matter- the parody does work well and is convincingly done, but I was all to aware of the fabricated nature of it to stay within the film. Indeed, I felt myself 'awakening' a few times towards the end and becoming conscious of myself watching a movie again. Sure enough it's an original take on narration but not always for the best.The film itself is every writer's fantasy film, focusing on Charlie himself as a struggling artist, trying to pin down and --- Y'know what, I've just had a think to myself and what I was complaining about up there was bullshit. 'Adaptation.' doesn't swallow itself in its own parody, how could it? It is constantly aware of itself, being as it is a self-conscious film or more precisely, script. The film itself adapts to the situations and flow of the creative process, not afraid to leave what it loves or believes in. How could he just stop taking an interest in fish right? Does he need a reason? Nope, and neither does Kaufman here.Wonderful. Simply wonderful.Oh and if you're reading this and you've not seen this film yet, I realise you have no idea what I'm going on about. Stop reading this and watch the film, then continue.Anyway where was I? Ah yes...The film is a wonderful study of a struggling artist trying to paint an unknown beauty he can vaguely see in his mind. This isn't the only theme of the story, in fact 'Adaptation.' has many, all established at the beginning, after a muffin and some coffee. The film mixes many genres, never willing to submit to finding its own space in a set aside corner of rules, often generating many different styles of writing into itself, creating a film free to be at peace with its own nature.Charlie works as a very interesting center piece for these ideas, as are the rest of the characters whom are masterfully developed with perfect pace without even knowing it. Kind of like the insect that pollinates a flower, right? Nicholas Cage and Meryl Streep both deliver fantastic performances, as do the whole cast who help to bring the characters to life realistically and suitably to the script.So that's about it, I'm hungry and really can't think of much else to say except 'see this movie'. Although, if you haven't seen it then you either skipped the middle part of my review, or you just didn't heed my advice and so probably won't watch the film whether i recommend it or not. However, if you did do as I said or you simply HAD already seen the film then there is really no need for me to recommend it to you.Whatever, I recommend it nonetheless. With it's wonderful direction by Jonze, and beautiful photography amongst some of the other reasons I've hardly touched on in this rabble of a review, you'd be a fool not to.Oh and one more thing: I actually enjoy narration in film."
221,Adaptation.,7,26 August 2007,bonkers fun,"Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze up the ante with ""Adaptation"" a bonkers self-referential splurge on writers' block and orchids (as a metaphor for passion).Kaufman includes himself as a character in this script, and his portrayal is everything a screenwriter should be: self-deprecating, overweight and hopelessly timid. His character is wonderfully offset by a fictitious identical twin brother, an equal parts lovable and infuriating character who typifies the awful amateur screenwriter, with banal, idiotic and overused ideas, who to top it all off is excepted in to the industry by blind luck. Both characters are brought to life by Nicolas Cage who, while I generally dislike, shows his ability as a half-decent actor during some of the more tender scenes between the two characters.The story itself concerns Kaufman's attempt to adapt ""The Orchid Thief"" a real life unadaptable novel in to a feature script, intertwined with the story of how the book was written. The two narratives are very different and interweave surprisingly well, blurring the line between fiction and reality to an enchanting degree; it is only when the two narratives meet at the film's finale that problems occur. The film suddenly delves in to pure fantasy and the jump is perhaps a little sudden - although this is a minor complaint.Where the film really excels is in its bonkers self-referentiality and its cynical portrayal of the film industry. The film begins on set of ""Being John Malkovich"", a real life script written by Kaufman, with Kaufman's character watching on in alienation as his script is brought to the screen without a not a nod of respect or recognition passed his way. The downtrodden screenwriter is given a voice here, alienated on his own set and seen as a tool by his superiors (just somebody to turn the book in to a script, a middleman). For anyone with a mild interest in the film industry this a joy to watch, packed full of in-jokes ( ""Don't call it a pitch.""), rarely is the industry portrayed in the cynical light it deserves and rarely is the most disrespected member of that industry (aside from us runners!) given a voice. The inclusion of real script writing guru Robert McKee is also fantastic (played by the masterful Brian Cox), but scriptwriting elitists may be disappointed to see he is portrayed in a positive light by the film's closing.The ending is, for the most part, a happy one - in fact the character goes through everything Kaufman denies as being ""real life"" at the start of the movie: ""I don't want to cram in sex or guns or car chases or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. The book isn't like that, and life isn't like that, it just isn't. I feel very strongly about this."" Is the fact that Kaufman goes through all these things a contradiction in the script, or is Kaufman admitting (like McKee) that sometimes life can be like the movies? This is open to interpretation but either way the cynics will be disappointed.In conclusion anyone with an interest in scriptwriting or the film industry in general should check this out. If you are fan of Spike Jonze or Charlie Kaufman this is essential viewing. And if you like the sound of a bonkers post-modern struggle of a downtrodden scriptwriter interlaced with intriguing musings on life, love passion and orchids then give ""Adaptation"" a go."
222,Adaptation.,7,30 June 2007,Great character study with elements of love and tragedy but also with a certain bleak energy few other films have ever had.,"What have I come to expect from Charlie Kaufman? I odd, the wired, the 'close to impossible to work out' yet the strangely compelling. Already famed for the 1999 film Being John Malkovich which I liked, and the equally effective Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind; Adaptation. (with a period) is another film from Kaufman that tackles people either playing themselves in a film we're already seeing or people we know playing people we've heard of, again in a film that we're already seeing  such is the bizarreness of Kaufman.Adaptation. takes on a slight biographical approach in that it documents a period from someone's life although what it does cleverly here is that is documents two lives  that of author Susan Orlean (Streep) and Kaufman himself (Cage). One story is set several years ago about Orlean writing a book on orchids but in a filmic sense; it's a love story. The other segment revolves around Kaufman (another author in his own right) in the present attempting to adapt the book Orlean has obviously, successfully written whereas in a filmic sense; it's a bit of a tragedy. The two stories are put across in a satisfying manner where we never spend too long with either/or but Kaufman's story is the more interesting  whether this is down to the fact he wants the emphases to be on him or if I could just relate to it better, is beyond me but I did find the scenes with his 'brother' Donald (Cage, again) much more funny, interesting and satisfying than I did Orlean's with flower expert Chris Cooper (John Laroche) Adaptation. works because it is basically a fly on the wall look at what trials and tribulations a major Hollywood writer faces when doing a script, or in this case an adaptation. Charlie struggles with his fantastical ideas about 'doing something different' or 'making a film about flowers' or even ignoring typical Hollywood traits of the good guy, the bad guy, epiphanies, etc. whilst his brother Donald keeps enthusiastically updating us and Charlie of his amazing, super-duper, out of this world Hollywood script about a serial killer and police characters and the fact it's going to be an awesome thriller. This is further put across when Charlie attends a seminar on scriptwriting and zones out when the lecturer goes on and on about plot points, epiphanies, protagonists and the like.Adaptation. is also clever because it comes very close to breaking its own reality which is something I'm sure nine out of ten film going people will not be used to. This occurs when the character of Cooper states, upon hearing of an adaptation of the book, that he can 'play himself'. The fact John Laroche is already an actor as it stands is one of those tiny moments in a film where you actually have to pause for a while just to try and figure it out. The film had tempted itself to break its own filmic reality already with behind the scenes footage of Being John Malkovich as well as this other incident which is a sign of good, experimental, film making and writing. Even if the final third is a real culture shock in the sense it plays out like some sort of action film set piece finale which is, in truth, a little messy and un-enjoyable in comparison to the rest of the film  the brilliant acting and writing is still there throughout which gains even more respect when you realise the director is more used to making music videos. Fans of Kaufman, I'm sure, will love this film and I have to admit; I enjoyed it in its own respect as well."
223,Adaptation.,10,8 January 2007,I agree with the person who commented before me.,"Adaptation had to end the way that it did. The entire point of the movie was to alert the viewers that things do happen in life. Things change, and we must adapt. Things happen, and we must adapt. One cannot pretend that ""not much happens"". If one does pretend that ""not much happens"" then one will suffer the same type of psychological stress that Kaufman underwent in Adaptation--constantly picking away at situations; always analyzing the pros and cons. A claim that wouldn't be completely out of line would be that Kaufman over did it there at the end. This, however, is where the person who commented before me takes over and spins it straight for you. In Kaufman's world he had to ""hollywood"" the adaptation or else he would have never adapted to the world as it was. The adaptation of The Orchid Thief was an analogy for Charlie Kaufman adapting to the world. Until he realized that things really do happen he would remain a nervous wreck and he couldn't have finished the adaptation which to Kaufman means either a psychological or physical death. This becomes clear when it is seen that Susan lied in her book and that she had truly seen the orchid. She was disappointed. She had been chasing a ghost and when she found it, she was no better for it. The overall message is that it takes sides of both types of people--those who pursue the ghosts of dreams (Susan) and those who are too nervous to begin the pursuit for fear of failure(Kaufman)--to ever truly be content with one's existence. Charlie Kaufman succeeded because he was, at the end, finally willing to pursue his dreams. My hypothesis as to why Susan never found happiness and Donald died is because they both were stuck in the mind-set of pursuing the ghosts of dreams. Susan still wanted to find the ""big bang"" of life and so she fell into drug use; Donald wanted to be a big screenwriter. Both were too in touch with chasing the ghosts of dreams that they couldn't see reality. Sometimes they succeed (as Donald did with ""The Three"") but they can hardly stop the excitement in order to passionately feel inner satisfaction. I would say that Donald's death was more of a metaphorical death.This movie really was incredible. A great piece of art that certainly shouts out the need for dynamic, dualistic thought in today's world."
224,Adaptation.,6,1 January 2007,Brilliantly Written Satire Of Loser Screenwriter Trying To Adapt An Acclaimed Novel,"Charlie Kaufman is a neurotic and somewhat pretentious Hollywood screenwriter who has been asked to adapt a book called The Orchid Thief, by Susan Orlean, a journalist for the New Yorker magazine. Charlie is struggling with a) adapting someone else's work, b) turning a story about flowers into an interesting movie, c) doing justice to the book and d) chronic self-doubt in his talent. To make things worse his happy-go-lucky brother Donald has just penned a successful script about a serial killer, which the studio loves. When the brothers go to New York and start spying on Susan, things start to get really confusing ...This is an enjoyably mindbending splurge of a film; my plot summary really doesn't start to do it justice and the script - by Charlie and Donald Kaufman - is wickedly inventive on about a hundred different levels. It satirises self-obsessed writers and Hollywood ethics, it blurs the reality/fantasy line with delicious results, it's a philosophical commentary on natural mutability, it's creatively self-referential (Donald's script, The 3, is simultaneously trash and a sly commentary on the action) and somehow the characters influence the story rather than the other way around - when Cox tells Cage the ending must be exciting but still true to the characters, Kaufman's (real) script does exactly that. The plot becomes the ouroboros snake it talks about and ends up eating itself. Other movies have trod this ground before (The Bad And The Beautiful, The Big Picture, Barton Fink) but this is a great headspin on those and quite unique. On top of this you have two great performances by Cage and a strong supporting cast. For me however, the direction is a bit variable - Jonze has some bravura sequences (Kaufman's evolution montage, the fatal car-crash) but the film isn't much of a looker, all MTV fast cutting and very little sweep to the visuals. My favourite aspect of this movie is the Big Joke, which is that Donald Kaufman doesn't exist. There is a real Charlie Kaufman, a real Susan Orlean, a real John Laroche, a real Robert McKee and a real book called The Orchid Thief. But Charlie's brother is fictitious, and Orlean didn't run off to Florida become a dope-smoking murderous lunatic. That stuff was made up. The script was nominated for an Oscar for (naturally) Best Adapted Screenplay (it lost to The Pianist), which means that Donald Kaufman became the only fictional character to be applauded by the mighty wisdom that is The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and to have a movie dedicated to his memory. This joke alone is worth seeing the movie for, and I bet somewhere some big studio executive has asked if there is a real script for The 3 which they can look into adapting."
225,Adaptation.,9,18 December 2006,Great movie,"I will not reveal anything about the story of Adaptation because it is so unpredictable that the best thing is to see this movie without knowing anything.The script is intelligent,original,unpredictable and complex and that's simply brilliant.Another brilliant thing about the script is that it shows parallel stories,various characters and different points of view and everything finishes perfectly and on an unpredictable way.The great Spike Jonze directed the movie perfectly.Nicolas Cage brings a perfect performance as twins brothers.It is always easy to note who is who thanks to Cage's brilliant performance.This is an original movie.This is an art film.Rating:9.5"
226,Adaptation.,9,16 December 2006,It's simply untrue!  Nicholas Cage is actually a good actor,"I have heard many say that Nicholas Cage is not a good actor. This movies shows that the exact opposite is true. It was no easy task playing two brothers - Don and Charlie Kaufman. Don is the womanizing, hip, script writer with popular tastes. Charlie is the nerdy, intellectual, script writer, who repels women by his absolutely pathologically low-self esteem and fear of rejection. Each character is played so well by Cage. I really felt for Charlie, knowingly full well what it is like not being Don. It also helped that there was a great cast, including Meryl Streep and Charlie Cooper. Cooper, a Kansas native, somehow falls very well into the role of a charming, yet sleazy opportunist in the Florida everglades. Cooper's character is obsessed with collecting things, and now has become obsessed with stealing rare orchids, although against state law. He even brilliant exploits political correctness/multiculturalism by bringing along Native Americans, under the guise of using the orchids for traditional ceremonies. This movie works on many levels. It mixes fantasy with reality. After all, the script writers are Don and Charlie Kaufman. Yet, their real lives become part of the movie plot. The ending, I don't wish to give away, but is very hopeful. The Charlie Kaufman's of the World have the hope that time is on their side."
227,Adaptation.,10,1 October 2006,Amazing writing,"This movie isn't the greatest example to connect with on the surface, unless your a writer trying to tell a unique story. This is more than a male writer that is lonely with writers block and writing himself into his story. This is a movie about failure. Charlie's goal was to write a story about flowers without making it into a Hollywood movie, but in the end he does by turning the flowers into drugs, cliché dialogue, and transforming the movie into a suspense. He adapted to Hollywood's standards to his script for the sake of finishing the script (living). The best thing I love about this movie is that it contains the classical arc, a mini arc, and an anti arc. Kaufman is one of the most brilliant known writers out there."
228,Adaptation.,10,13 September 2006,What a great movie!,"Weird and wonderful every step of the way, with another highly original Charlie Kaufman script and inspired direction by Spike Jonze. Nicolas Cage has never been better, creating two distinct characters in his twin brother roles (and hasn't technology come a long way since ""The Patty Duke Show""?) and evoking sympathy for both, even with all their flaws. Chris Cooper was richly deserving of the Oscar he won for this. His role, which in lesser hands might have become a caricature, is truly unforgettable -- funny, sad, mysterious, charming, repulsive... The list goes on. And what can anyone say about the great Meryl Streep at this point that hasn't already been said? I'll give it a try: Hearing her deliver the line ""You fat f*ck!"" was one of my favorite movie-going moments of all time."
229,Adaptation.,9,12 September 2006,"Great film taken down to ""flawed masterpiece"" status due to ending.","""Adaptation"", Charlie Kaufman's third best film, which could have been his second (next to ""Eternal Sunshine..."" and ""Being John Malkovich""), is his witty, solipsistic flawed masterpiece. One of the best voice over's in history starts the film off, as a contradiction to screen writing guru Robert Mckee's own writings on the subject, narrated by Charlie Kaufman (Nicholas Cage plays the real-life screenwriter.) He's written himself into the film, because supposedly the first draft for the script of the film was not up to his usual standards. So he writes a film about his ""failure"" to write this particular film. A stroke of genius on his behalf. From what I've researched Charlie Kaufman genuinely doesn't like what Robert McKee has to say in real life about screen writing, which is why he wrote this person as a character into the film.Maybe as a way of venting his annoyance at such pompous people. McKee is certainly a professional, he knows a thing or two about the subject, but he isn't exactly successful.And he proves, in my opinion, along with others like Syd Field, that screen writing can't really be taught. You probably need talent like Kaufman, who makes this abundantly clear to his fictitious clown of a more attractive twin brother, Donald (also played by Nicholas Cage.)I've yet to mention part of the main plot. This film is (loosely) based on the book ""The Orchid Thief"", by Susan Orlean, also a character in the film (played by the sublime Meryl Streep.)John Laroche is the real-life orchid thief (Chris Cooper won his first Oscar playing him), some of the earlier moments with the seminal native American Indians are hilarious, where he tries to convince a police officer that stealing the plants is OK, because they'll just get away with it:They're Indians and have a right to flower-poach, according to him. Kaufman masturbates over several of the attractive girls he meets in the film such as his producer. One in particular is the waitress at the coffee shop, who after she realizes he's asking her out is horrified and we never see her again. The little moments like these come together in an interesting and unorthodox way, using no recognizable McKee-esquire ""structure"", which Donald successfully uses to sell a terrible Hollywood parody of a screenplay,via Charlie Kaufman's lewd, real world screen writing agent. This is just as Charlie is about to do the thing he secretly swore not to, to go and seek advice from Robert McKee ( played by Brian Cox) himself.After Charlie is fraught over being a sellout for going to the seminar, he decides to write the very ending he always dreaded.The actual writer did this as a parody, but the fact is, is it's still a Hollywood-cliché ending, despite this. It's not funny. I love watching the film but know it's going to end in an unfocused way.This is why I can't give it full-marks, a ten out of ten. It's own genius ending doesn't entertain me because it's your usual Hollywood trite, contrived mess.I don't care if it's supposed to be funny. It ruins what should have been an absolute masterpiece. However, it's still an excellent, well-acted and overall well written film,using the amazing visual storytelling style of director Spike Jonze. Highly recommended. If you can overlook the ending."
230,Adaptation.,10,15 August 2006,Review.,"""This is pretty ironic - I'm actually going through writer's block trying to write a review on Adaptation., the Spike Jonze movie with that perfect script by Charlie Kaufman... Maybe I should just start by dropping some Hollywood names that are in the film like Nicolas Cage, or Meryl Streep, or Chris Cooper. Yeah, Chris Cooper's good because then I could go into how he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work in this as the orchid thief, John Laroche... Oh wait, but then how do I also backtrack and mention that Nic and Meryl were also nominated? The readers would see that fact as a minor detail when it's really an honor to be nominated at all. Oh jeez! What if they just see the actors as minor details? Maybe they think who's in it means nothing if there is no plot... Well, they'd be right... Okay, I'll talk about the plot then... although the plot doesn't sound very intriguing on paper... I mean, blog... Well, who knows? Would a movie about Charlie Kaufman struggling to put Susan Orlean's book The Orchid Thief into script form while he deals with his own insecurities and his happy-go-lucky twin brother Donald's attempts at writing a script sound interesting to anybody?... Out loud, it sounds pretty complex. Is complexity a good thing?... Hold on. Reviews are opinions, so they'll want my opinions of the movie and why I gave it a perfect rating... Well, I like that it's part narrative, part autobiographical, part fictional (since his twin doesn't and never did exist in real life), part sequel to Being John Malkovich, in a way... Part romantic, part suspense, part action flick... See? That's the thing! I honestly think this movie has something for everybody, but I can't type that without it sounding cliché and unoriginal (sigh). Well I've typed so much already, I should probably just go into my favorite scene now... But what is my favorite scene? They're all so well done... Every time Laroche speaks?... When Charlie is attending the writing lectures?... I'll just say it's the climax when the brothers are being chased by Orlean and Laroche. I like that kind of action, which makes me a sicko, I guess... No, maybe it just makes me human and just like everybody else..... Maybe they will like this review. I hope they like that I wrote it in a Charlie Kaufman style... It was fun to write, at least - mostly because of my love and appreciation for Adaptation., Charlie Kaufman's masterpiece."""
231,Adaptation.,9,14 August 2006,"Seriously, watch it","This movie is pretty genius. It was written by the same screenwriter of Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Charlie Kaufman), and if you've seen those you know how original and quirky it is, and what kind of humor is underneath the tragic story. Adaptation was, in my opinion, better than both of those other films.Nicolas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman, and his fictitious twin brother Donald Kaufman. Charlie is adapting a book, The Orchid Thief (a real book by Susan Orlean), but is having trouble writing the screenplay. He ends up writing himself into the movie. The completed product is this genius movie, Adaptation."
232,Adaptation.,10,27 May 2006,Kaufman does it again,"After watching this i went out and bought Being John Malkovich because i was so taken aback by the talent and skill of Charlie Kaufmans story telling storytelling. Jonze also portrays his skill as a director by adapting Kaufmans work even to something that actually works and makes sense.Is it possible that after Being John Malkovich that any other story Kaufman writes could be anymore original and strange. The characters are excellent, the dialogue is brilliant and the story is ever so compelling. This is definitely for anyone who loves Kaufman and Jonze and can appreciate such a off the wall film."
233,Adaptation.,10,16 March 2006,An amazing accomplishment. Probably the best film so far this century,"Every once in a while a film comes along that simply electrifies you and pushes the cinematic experience to the highest level of enjoyment. Adaptation is one of those films. It's a huge accomplishment on all levels reaching some of my greatest emotions while entertaining me like no other film.Adaptation is a complex but also realistic account of what people go through creatively. The film follows a writer Charlie Kaufman, played by Nicolas Cage, who is assigned to adapt a book about orchids from a book written by an author by the name of Susan Orlean played by Meryl Streep. The film jumps back in forth beetween Charlies struggle to adapt the book and Susan's struggle to write it while getting the information for it from a weird man by the name of John Laroche.The film jumps back in forth beetween these three people struggling to find meaning in life. Susan's goal is to dedicate herself to something and have that feeling of love and connection to it. Charlie's goal in the film is to connect with Susan while adapting her book.Describing this film is nearly impossible to do considering it incorporates so many elements and breaks into so many genres. Jonze and Kaufman create one of the most original and thought provoking films I've ever seen. It's amazing to be in the hands of two artists with three of the greatest actors around all giving Oscar worth performances. I don't have much more to say about Adaptation. Of course, I could walk you through the plot but that would be like walking you through a trip through the stars. This film is endless and you will not see a film anytime soon that electrifies your emotions and feelings. Just watch these two masters at the pinnacle of their creativity and be amazed. 10-10"
234,Adaptation.,8,17 February 2006,Just how do you follow up a movie about being inside the head of an actor?,"Well,if you're director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman,you do this movie. Picking up from the filming of ""Being John Malkovich"",we look into the mind and life of the writer himself,(Nicolas Cage,which might look like a typo to the uninitiated),and man,IS he a MESS! Not so much career-wise(though he'd beg to differ),but in terms of personal baggage and insecurity. He is perpetually fraught with a sense of inadequacy and inferiority. Not so the case of Donald(also Cage),his twin,a relaxed,free-spirited sort who makes up for his open-ended lifestyle with his easy sense of humor and his way with the ladies. Kaufman has agreed to adapt a screenplay of the NYT bestseller ""The Orchid Thief"". The book,which is an expansion of an article written for the New Yorker by one Susan Orleans(Meryl Streep,showing exhaustion here),chronicles her tracking a Florida eccentric named LaRoche(Chris Cooper,unrecognizable and spot-on)who's made it his life journey to find rare flowers,in this case,the Ghost Orchid. When Charlie finds himself seemingly and impenetrably blocked,he finds to his great chagrin his twin breezing through a less-than original script for a derivative movie script that sells easily and will go for ""the high sixes to a mill and a half"",by his own agent's reckoning. Meanwhile,Charlie finds the struggle to adapt the book becoming herculean,and becomes desperate to find inspiration and ""frame"" the story.This is a tough film to enjoy,but it's not too tough to get. As a person who fancies himself a writer myself,I have a taste of how blockage can be stifling,and I haven't written anything that has amounted to a quarter or dime yet,let alone something that is to be bought and sold by a movie studio or publisher! The performances are painful but strong. Cage,to me,rescued his stagnating career(""Gone in 60 seconds"" anyone?) in this film,playing disparate twins without ever mixing their qualities. Streep is a picture of quiet desperation gone batty,and Cooper truly deserved his Oscar as the both decrepit and sympathetic Orchid Thief. If you can sit through moments of genuine pain and overwhelming introspection,I suspect you will get this film completely. While it wasn't the way I thought Jonze and Kaufmann would follow up ""Malkovich"",it is unique and certainly hard to forget or dismiss."
235,Adaptation.,5,7 February 2006,Meta-Madness,"""Adaptation."" is a movie more enjoyable to discuss than to watch. Even within the film, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman seems unable to resist giving us his own review.""It's a disaster. I don't know what I'm doing."" ""It's self-indulgent. It's narcissistic. It's solipsistic. It's pathetic."" ""You write a story without conflict or crisis, you'll bore them right outta their minds.""""Adaptation,"" to dispense with the pretentious titular punctuation, is about man's struggle for meaning and originality, both in movies and in life. Anyway, I think that's the idea. Nicolas Cage plays Kaufman, the real-life writer of the movie, who employs two other real-life characters, New Yorker writer Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) and rare-orchid collector John Laroche (Chris Cooper), and makes them characters in his untenable script. Kaufman's goal is to write an adaptation of Orlean's ""The Orchid Thief"" that's true to the book and doesn't cop out to Hollywood cliché. But Kaufman doesn't count on his twin brother Donald (also Cage), a walking Hollywood cliché.Cooper is electric in an Academy Award winning performance as ""the crazy plant-nut guy,"" and Cage even better in his dual role, but ""Adaptation"" is a muddy mess of a film, so focused on pushing borders about what is real that it never makes us care about the characters or the story. At one point, Charlie compares himself to the ouroboros, a mythical self-devouring snake, and he's saying it so you know he anticipates your problems with his screenplay. He's a clever guy, alright, just not much fun to be with.Like ""Being John Malkovich,"" Kaufman's previous collaboration with director Spike Jonze (which we see being made in the opening minutes of the film), ""Adaptation"" uses real-life characters and the art (""don't say 'industry'"") of movie-making to score philosophical points about the nature of identity, just what makes someone real as opposed to a figment in someone else's mind. At times, the film is quite engaging playing off these concepts, scoring some points.In one scene, we see the romantically-challenged Charlie attracted to a waitress who serves him Key Lime pie. He invites her to an orchid show, and her reaction is so over-the-top horror-struck that it seems a miscalculation on the part of the filmmakers, until you realize what you are watching is a scene in Charlie's head and thus a satire of the kind of reaction lovelorn nerdy guys expect and dread from such overtures.There's also Charlie's dressing down from a screen writing guru, and a touching scene near the end between Charlie and Donald where they talk about a girl they went to school with named Sarah Marsh. By that time, however, the rest of the movie has gone off the rails, as the real Kaufman makes his comment on Hollywood's cheapening effect on real meaning and its obsession to ""wow them at the end."" This means ditching the more problematic part of the story, Orlean and Laroche, by making them protagonists in a faux-thriller that doesn't really blend with what came before. Maybe that's the point, that there's an inherent flaw with a form of art so unrepresentational, so dishonest in its surreal pretense at reality.My biggest problem with ""Adaptation"" is the deadly seriousness of it, the never-ending pushiness of its provocation, especially coming after ""Being John Malkovich,"" a film that made its own darkly clever points with grace and ample good humor. Kaufman and Jonze there played with conventions and the audience's minds in a way that made it enjoyable. Here you expect an acid trip and get an aspirin trip.Wasn't one car crash enough?"
236,Adaptation.,10,3 February 2006,Kaufman writes Kaufman,"Perhaps 2002's most unpredictable and intelligently layered film, 'Adaptation' follows the writer Charlie Kaufman as he writes himself into his own screenplay about writing a screenplay about a book and the author writing the book. By the sounds of it, a movie this complicated and pretentious is doomed to fall short but it's the Seinfeld-esquire ending that comes together so well, and what lies in store is a payoff you are guaranteed never to forget. 'Adaptation' is a very well rounded movie, in that its plot provides a twisted story that starts out innocently enough but takes a turn when Charlie's (imaginary) twin brother Donald begins to work on Charlie's script, therein lays the joke of 'The 3'. Charlie refuses to write a script involving car crashes, sex and guns and then finishes with an ending exclusively featuring those very things, showing us that Donald represented the changes that Charlie needed to adapt, a key theme in the movie and also the title of the film.The style of this film comes as unpredictably as the roll of a dice. It begins with a very stream-of-consciousness feel from Charlie trying to start the script. The film then jumps back and forth between Charlie struggling, Susan writing her book, her love story and demise and Donald suddenly aspiring to be like his script-writing brother. Considering the flow of the movie and its parts, the sum is nearly impossible to put in any genre. When recommending this movie, one might simply say it's a 'Kaufman' or a 'Jonze', which brings the next point. It's only these two filmmakers that can add little quirks like the dial tone, script guru Robert McKee or even Kaufman writing Kaufman to make a movie feel much more personal and memorable.The cinematography is the icing on this very sweet cake. Within the first few moments of the film, we are thrown into a montage of the evolution of the earth and man. If this quick-paced sequence doesn't grab you, then perhaps this movie isn't for you. The film continues its lavish sights with orchids, Florida swamps and perhaps two of the most realistic car crashes ever committed to film. It's easy to doubt if the movie is as well rounded or as near perfect as one would remember, but upon every viewing the audience is thrown deeper into this 'film onion', forced to peel away the very rewarding layers of Adaptation for days."
237,Adaptation.,10,26 January 2006,Perfect Script,"One of the most perfect scripts ever written, in my opinion, which combines with a sensitive and subtle direction. The way Kaufman plays with reality and fiction, while laughs at the face of hundreds of incompetent screenwriters (he has found the perfect solution for adapting a boring novel making a great movie even being absolutely true to the original book), the characters (Kaufman himself, and his fictitious twin brother too), the performances (Cooper as John Laroche, simply amazing)... everything is perfectly done in this movie. This is the kind of movie that makes someone think about why do other movies with mediocre scripts and plagued of topics have such an economical success, and other little independent movies fall sadly on the ignorance of the great public. However, I recommend every lover of good movies not to pay attention to its not-very-attractive cover and give the movie a chance. I'd recommend it to everyone."
238,Adaptation.,7,16 June 2005,lack of conclusive flow,"the body of this movie portrayed its characters without flaw. unique in living and writing. i feel deeply in with the majority of this movie. the ending did not sit well with me though. i understand that the end is in mimic of donald's personality and life mantra, yet the end seemed in haste. like the explanation for character's actions wasn't fully developed. i didn't feel that susan's character, especially, was followed in the conclusion to this film. it seemed that, in order for jonze to fit his theme into the conclusion he had to drop a little bit of characters' integrity; flow. i cant decided if the ending's lack of flow is due to confusion, laziness, or lack of talent."
239,Adaptation.,7,3 March 2004,"Part genius, part con job","ADAPTATION is a one-joke movie. It is a funny joke, and the film tells it repeatedly with various different variations, but it, nonetheless, has only one joke to tell. And like a comic on a roll, the film zips along at a manic pace, milking the gag for all it's worth -- until it is suddenly apparent that the material has run dry. Desperation sets in and the film takes on a hysterical quality until it simply drops dead from exhaustion. The joke, however, is clever. Faced with the inability to come up with a credible screen adaptation of the book ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan Orlean, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman penned a story about a man named Charlie Kaufman, who is unable to write a script based on a book called ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan Orlean. In a devious masterstroke, Kaufman manages to avoid doing the job he was hired to do and ends up coming up with something uniquely original. As such, ADAPTATION is part genius and part con job.As Charlie, Nicholas Cage is doubly wonderful because he also plays Charlie's evil twin bother, Donald, an aspiring screenwriter. In a tidy bit of irony, Charlie is the genius and Donald is the hack, but Charlie is paralyzed with indecision and doubt, while the pragmatic fictional Donald is honest and genuine in his enthusiasm. Kaufman creates between the two ""brothers"" a battle between the desire to produce art and the need to be entertaining and commercial. ADAPTATION is less a movie than an essay on the creative process.Cage, never resorting to make up tricks, endows Donald and Charlie with two separate and distinct personalities. It is probably the best performance of his career. In wonderful supporting roles Meryl Streep as Susan Orlean and Chris Cooper as John Laroche, ""the orchid thief,"" play real life people, who are turned into fictional characters who are ""real"" people who become fictional characters. All in all, under Spike Jonez's clever direction the result is exhilarating, playful and quite fun.Until the final quarter of the film when it all collapses into a confused and ridiculous mess. The obvious intent of turning a film about not selling out into a film parodying the act of selling out must have seemed clever. But the personal, introverted psychodrama suddenly makes a play at being an over-the-top thriller, but hasn't the style or inventiveness to pull it off. It is a bold and daring move on the part of the filmmakers, but it just doesn't work. There is an art to selling out, as well as to being original, and Kaufman and Jonez haven't the knack -- yet. Though it all flirts with genius, ADAPTATION needs another rewrite -- or at least a better punchline."
240,Adaptation.,6,12 December 2003,"Nick Cage plays a bud-ding writer who ends up stalk-ing an author. OK, I'll leaf out the easy puns","A nice, honest, if ultimately slow film from Spike Jonze. It is tricky, not least because it's self-referential, in order to examine the creative process that gives birth to successful cinema. So to have Kaufmann (Cage) moaning about the ostensibly dull subject matter of the book on flora that he's adapting is rather like the character saying 'this film is boring' to camera.However, the unusual mix of Hollywood-naked asides ('footage' of Jonze's previous film, Being John Malkovich), strong characters and self-contained plot lines - that we don't spend the whole film waiting for them all to join up as they do - makes a detailed sum that transcends the nerdy nominal subject. Nick Cage turns out a great performance to restore faith lost since, well, Leaving Las Vegas... and in two parts. You keep waiting for him to lapse into his cameo gear but both characters attract genuine sympathy. Meryl Streep is a confident character bulwark for the plot, but little else - Chris Cooper's Best Supporting Actor Oscar is deserved here. Nice soundtrack. 6/10"
241,Adaptation.,8,23 October 2003,One of those films you don't fully understand until hours later,"Pros:-Performances-Seamless interaction between the two Cage characters-Very original storyCons:-A little hard to follow__________________________________________________________________(minor spoilers within) The story follows the struggle of Charlie Kaufman (played by Nicolas Cage, in his best performance ever) as he struggles to adapt real-life novel ""The Orchid Thief"", by real-life author Susan Orlean, into a screenplay. As the very abstract and fragmented, yet strangely well-flowing plot goes on, we begin to see that he is, in fact, writing the screenplay for the film we're seeing right now. Confused?Well, if you are, you do get over it, if not during the film, afterward, when you manage to piece together what you've just seen. While things do take a turn for the bizarre as the story goes on, this ultimately works to the film's credit, as it just serves to build further on the theme behind Charlie's struggle: How do you tell a story in which nothing changes, nothing is resolved, and no one learns anything?Is this one of those stories? Certainly not. The theme, if a tad elusive, is there, and it is this theme that makes this such an excellent film.8/10"
242,Adaptation.,,12 October 2003,clever but doesn't cohere,"There are some immensely clever moments in this movie, and it operates on many levels at once. The acting is excellent, with outstanding performances by Meryl Streep, Nicolas Cage, and Chris Cooper. It's an affecting movie; I dreamed about the characters. Unfortunately, as a result of its devotion to its gimmick, the movie doesn't cohere very well. Adaptation doesn't live up to the bar set by Being John Malkovich. However, if I hadn't seen Being John Malkovich, I would probably like Adaptation better."
243,Adaptation.,,19 September 2003,Got the joke... wasn't laughing,"This movie tried very hard to be a witty and intellectual film to no avail.  Anyone can make a movie and make fun of their movie in the movie, while making fun of other movies at the same time, and that doesn't make their movie a masterpiece.  I can suck at movie-making, tell you I suck in the movie I make, and that doesn't mean that my movie is a masterpiece; most likely it means the movie sucked.  That's basically what this movie did. It said, ""I tried very hard to make a good movie, I thought maybe making fun of this movie might help smooth over the rough spots, but in the end I am still a failure and so is the movie.""  To everyone that liked this movie: natural selection will eventually weed you out just like this movie will become weeded out shortly."
244,Adaptation.,,19 September 2003,My thoughts on the ending...,"Spoiler alert I've been glancing over a few of the comments here.  Some say that the ending is great.  Others say that while it is better than the ending to Being John Malkovich it is something that must be excused to really enjoy the rest of the movie.Well, I simply wanted to add my two cents, not because I believe I have anything particularly unique to say, but just because I can.  I thought the ending was hilarious.  I actually had to stop the DVD until I could compose myself, I was laughing so hard.  I don't know if this is a common reaction (I personally couldn't see many other people reacting this way) but if anybody else has had a similar experience, I would love to hear about it.To many people, the reasoning behind my reaction may be obvious, but to enlighten those who may have missed the point, let me elaborate.  The complete irony and total turn around from the screenplay that Charlie wants to write in the beginning of the movie, and the way the story turns out was just too funny for me.  Everything he didn't want to have in the movie to begin with was jam packed into the ending (which was the advice Charlie got from McKee - you have a good script if you have an ending that will wow them).  Orlean and La Rouche fall in love.  The whole search for the Ghost Orchid becomes a drug scandal.  There's a violent shoot-out in the end. Practically verbatim what he didn't want to add to begin with.I know the writer(s) did this on purpose :)  And I think anyone who hadn't caught on to this would have been totally confused and a little disappointed.  However, once I caught on it was like I suddenly got the punchline to a great big joke.  :)"
245,Adaptation.,,8 September 2003,A Brilliant Piece of Film,"Every now and then a film comes along that stuns you with a variety of complexed yet understandable inner thoughts and feelings. This film does just that. With an acting performance from Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper that is simply incredible.The film keeps one interested, even individuals who find that they haven't the patience to watch movies this heavy are drawn into it. Deservingly a masterpiece that etches itself into the viewers memories.
Although this definitely can't be watched more than once because of the sheer heaviness of the film it rates a 10/10 and a collector's piece. moviejungle.com"
246,Adaptation.,,14 August 2003,"Yes, this movie does have a cheesy ending, but that is the point.","Some spoilers may be contained within this review.The word adaptation has several meanings, and this movie cleverly delved into all of those meanings. Mainly, I think this movie was about one of the strongest forces experienced by humans - the judgment of other humans - and how this force causes us to adapt. Charlie was constantly listening to his critical inner voice, which is merely a recording of all the criticism he had received in the past. His way of adapting was to meticulously organize and mentally file the location of all those potential landmines to ensure that he could safely avoid them. This made him paralyzed to move...but at least he never got hurt. Susan was under the same kind of spell - paralyzed by the fear of those who would judge her if she left her husband. John Laroche used his hobbies as a way to make himself interesting, an authority, above question.Charlie was paralyzed in his writing in the same way he was paralyzed in his social life. The only character who was not so affected, was Charlie's brother, Donald. Donald had learned to adapt to the scrutiny of others a long time ago. Relief for Charlie from his mental prison came only when he began to see the wisdom behind his brother's apparent dim-wittedness. Donald revealed something to Charlie in the swamp that further boosted Charlie's newfound attitude (another adaptation). And that's why the movie had a gimmicky, Hollywood-standard, lowest-common-denominator-pleasing, cheesy ending. It was saying, ""Lighten up. Do what you love to do, and don't be afraid to admit that you love it. Don't chase other people's dreams or ideals because you won't know what to do with them if you catch them.""In the end, I do not think Donald had the best adaptation. I think it was the merging of Donald's love for all things and Charlie's calculated, logical approach that was the best adaptation.I hope everyone likes my review."
247,Adaptation.,,10 August 2003,Dr. Deconstruction -- The Serial Killer,"Movie: Very Good            Director: Excellent Cage: Excellent             Streep: Very Good Cooper: Excellent           Screenplay: ExcellentPhilosophically, I don't agree with this movie but, aesthetically, I think it is wonderfully executed. Very well thought out, it is extraordinary in its thoroughness. That the writer and director can look at their own thought process with the objectivity enough to be comedic is mind-blowing.
Although I, again, didn't care for the philosophy behind Being John Malkovich, this team seems to be warming up. I trust their next effort will be a perfect execution of their philosophies and abilities.Grading System: Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, Excellent"
248,Adaptation.,,8 August 2003,A brilliant multi-layered masterpiece,"Adaptation is truly wonderful, so don't even listen to what anyone says about it. Don't let your opinion of it be swayed, and watch it expecting something different. Adaptation is a movie you might have to watch two times..I know I did. so, do it if you have to. Adaptation is actually two different stories, one centering on Charlie Kaufman (played greatly by Nicholas Cage, shouldve won an Oscar)and his twin brother Donald (also played by Cage), and around the book Kaufman is adapting to a screenplay, called the Orchid Theif, and its mysertious author Susan Orlean (played by Meryl Streep in a stellar performance)I won't say anymore except, expect the unexpected, or just don't expect anything at all."
249,Adaptation.,,11 August 2003,Great Brain Food,"I really loved this movie.  It was so much fun to try and figure out what was going on and who these people were.  The relationship between Charles and Donald was great.  I was thoroughly engrossed for two hours, which is something that doesn't happen to me often when I watch movies."
250,Adaptation.,4,6 August 2003,"You keep right on fooling them, Charlie....","Slight spoilers are contained in this review. I basically bought this movie on DVD because it had attracted so much approbation, to say nothing of four Oscar nominations, one of them a winner.But that this movie got serious Oscar consideration for writing and performance seems to me to say more about the overall quality of 2002's movies rather than being indicative of superlative quality.Don't get me wrong. By and large it's not a *bad* movie. At least not until the part it's supposed to be bad, as a movie writing in-joke, on which more later. But to me an award-worthy script or performance has to be something that affects you emotionally and intellectually. I was certainly not moved by this clever-clever deconstruction of a movie script, and as far as I was concerned Cooper, Streep and Cage did good workmanlike jobs, but they weren't exactly peeling back the levels of human experience. Everyone involved with this movie must have been mystified when the nominations were announced, before whooping and shouting ""We fooled 'em!""Of course, Charlie Kaufman gets a lot of kudos for finally throwing off the writer's ""invisibility cloak"", and ensuring everybody knew that this was *his* movie, not the director's. Then he even got Spike Jonze himself to put in the film Kaufman's obvious disenchantment with the success, fame and critical acclaim Jonze got from filming Kaufman's ""Being John Malkovich"" script. To begin with I quite enjoyed the subversiveness of going to a flashback which then went to another flashback within the flashback, and the absolute brilliance of Kaufman writing about Kaufman who then writes about Kaufman writing about Kaufman. Kaufman writes his own kinds of movies and has achieved a distinct and welcome level of success with that. It seems almost mean spirited of him to then take a side swipe at formulaic movies by satirising the scriptwriting guru Robert McKee, who, for all his sins, is at least trying to maintain some kind of quality in Hollywood scripts - at least that's what I get from the eight of McKee's Ten Commandments I could read by freeze-framing the movie. McKee (the fictional one in the movie) says that you can do what you want in the first two acts of a movie as long as you give the audience a rip-roaring third act that they'll never forget. Well, that may have been the case twenty years ago when McKee was first promulgating his screenplay-writing nostrums, but today's high concept movies hook you with the first two acts, which will contain large amounts of great action, dialogue and special effects for putting into the trailer, then wrap up with a third act of predictable chases, an explosion or two, and a happy ending. Kaufman knows this, so he almost deliberately proves McKee wrong by sabotaging his own movie. People have said they hated what happened in the third act, or they didn't understand it until watching the movie a second time, and other people have chastised those people for failing to ""get the joke"". Oh, I get the joke all right, what I don't like is how Kaufman destroyed the characters he had spent all that time getting the audience to understand and care about. If we no longer care about Charlie and Donald (Donald having been reduced to a mere plot device), then how can we care about Charlie's anguished phone call to their mother? And how can we care any more about the love interest?It was really weird seeing Tilda Swinton (Orlando, Female Perversions, The Chronicles of Narnia) playing, like, an ordinary character part with no hidden depths. Not a bad job of looking 27 at the age of 42."
251,Adaptation.,10,3 August 2003,It's about me,"(POTENTIAL SPOILERS) Maybe some of you felt the same way when you saw it too. There is a lot of Charlie in me, and something was said in the movie that was a nearly verbatim echo of a poem I wrote six years ago. The part where Donald feels Susan is dishonest because of her scenario answer is beautiful. I feel the same way. People invariably pick the noblest sounding answers to questions like that. This is not to say I liked it just because I could see myself in it. This movie was very funny, highly original, and profound without trying to be. I loved it. This is the best movie I've seen since I saw 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' for the first time. Adaptaion never stands still. Whether you're gathering insights on the characters, seeing the creative process at work, or in the middle of a chase scene, there just isn't time to stop and smell the orchids. I'm glad I saw this on DVD instead of at the theater - I would have hated to miss anything. I can't imagine anyone liking this movie more than me, nor can I imagine anyone not liking this movie. It's a ten."
252,Adaptation.,,29 July 2003,One of the best written films of the year,"One of the best written films of the year.  Jonze and Kaufman have created another successful film.  Totally brilliantly written and acted. Cage is marvelous in a comeback role, Streep sparkles, but Cooper steals the film with his performance as Laroche.  If you haven't seen this film, see it."
253,Adaptation.,,19 July 2003,"Pretentiousness is sometimes good, but even then, only partially","Nicolas Cage, in a refreshing return to Acting, plays a (partially) fictionalized version of the talented screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, a self-loathing, yet self-reflexing, overweight, and socially inept ""industry player.""  This creative, interesting concept is a (partial) adaptation of ""The Orchid Thief,"" a book about one man's passion for orchid plant life in a stream of consciousness presentation.  However, due to the complexity of portraying such a book onto the big screen, Charlie Kaufman and his brother Donald (the real ones, not the character ones, but there is no real brother...ah, never mind) instead weave a tale following the attempt to write such an adaptation and the eventual intermingling of all their lives (screenwriters, subject, author).  From ""Adaptation,"" we learn that in the search for understanding others' passions, we ourselves lose sight of our own, but also can find new ones on the way.  The first two acts are a self-absorbed, but not, telling of the mundane hardships of real life.  By Act three, in an attempt to satirize Hollywood screenplays (with car chases, guns, love, happy endings), Jonze and Kaufman inadvertently fall victim to its own commentary, relying on such antics to maintain common interest. Therein lies the irony: this film believes it is too smart for its audience and everyone else, but at the same time loses sight of what they want to achieve.  Perhaps this was the filmmakers' goal (of satire), but in the end, by Act three, the plot takes a turn for the silly.  Overly silly.  Great concept, great development, near perfect first two act filmmaking, but final delivery is a bit weak - however in the end, passion, insider info, and a humor-filled, interesting plot are all conveyed."
254,Adaptation.,8,18 July 2003,Very Good Post-Modern Bliss,"There have been movies about writing movies before, just as there have been books about writing books.  After all, writers usually write about what they know.  And, for everyone out there who has ever set fingers to keyboard (or even the old school pen to paper) knows, if you're serious about writing, it can take over your life.But, where ""Adaptation"" is so much better than most other movies about writing movies, is that it blurs the line between fiction and non-fiction so much that it's almost too much to handle (especially if someone has never come across anything ""post-modern"" before).The greatness of this movie comes not necessarily from any particular plot contained within but how well the layers are interwoven.  The viewer is yanked around so much with all of the levels that eventually one begins to question what reality is.The amount of reality this movie is based on is astounding.  Charlie Kaufman is the real writer of the movie and the idea for writing a screenplay about flowers (while possibly not true or possibly so) is based on a real book. After that everything becomes fuzzy...Are some of the events in the movie actually based on reality?  Did Kaufman actually fly to New York to meet Susan Orlean and cure his writer's block (even if the results were very different)?  Did he honestly feel ignored on the set of ""Being John Malkovich""?  Did he try to pick up a waitress by inviting her to an orchid show?These are all plausible scenarios that he may have gone through while writing the screenplay for this very movie.  Where does the fiction end and the non-fiction begin?That's why it's a great script.  While a lot of movies tip their hands to their own making on occasion or poke fun at the screenwriter or director's other work, this movie actually pulls it off better than any I have seen.While there were parts that any sane individual might have edited differently (the end scene in Florida?), this was a close to pulling off post-modern literature on film as there is out there that I know of.This is a great movie to see for an aspiring author of any genre because it even sneaks in writing tips (although in a joking way).  The outcome wasn't perfect but the mere fact that the movie makes synapses fire in the mind that most movies don't is a great reason to watch it!8 (almost 9)/10"
255,Adaptation.,,16 July 2003,Amazingly clever,"This is the best written film i've ever seen. It cleverly discusses so many different themes from love to the artists' struggle to human nature and then also discusses the movie industry, and afterwards when you think about it more, about you the audience member as well. If you think that other people are raving about it more than it deserves, go back and watch it again, and try to remember everything that happens and everything that is said, because it is all pertenant.Don't read any more of this review if you haven't seen it yet. A lot of people seemed to have difficulty with the sharp shift from the thought inspiring gentle reflectiveness of the beginning of the film, to the spectacular and violent build to the climax. This shift happens just after the character of Charlie Kaufman goes to the bar with Bob McKee, the writing instructor after the seminar, and complains that he cannot make the story interesting enough. Bob tells him that nothing matters except having an exciting ending. Hence, the drugs, sex, guns, and car chase. The other aspects of the movie are also explained in itself if you pay attention, but i'm not going to explain them all. I suggest watching it again. It's amazing in every way that a movie can amaze. Here's another interesting fact that makes the movie even that much more clever. In real life, Charlie Kaufman is married and has children, and was a comedic actor for some time, so i don't imagine that he really suffers from so much anxiety. I have also heard that he doesn't have a brother, but i'm not sure if that's true."
256,Adaptation.,,12 July 2003,Great Movie,"The merits of this movie have been repeated ad nauseam already, so I won't go into them.  I just wanted to note that pretty much all of the negative comments thus far have displayed a total lack of understanding of the real point of the movie, i.e. they deride the ending for being exactly that which it is supposed to be, an incredibly ""Hollywood"" piece of schlock.  Same with those who complain that a screenwriter's life is way too boring to make a movie out of, when that fact specifically plays a role in the movie.Kudos also to whoever pointed out that the flowers at the very end were in reference to Kaufman's line from the beginning of the movie."
257,Adaptation.,9,10 July 2003,A study of the value of storytelling,"What an amazing film.  On the surface it just seems like a really strange, tricky movie, one of those mind-bending, self referential things.  Charlie Kaufman sets out to adapt a book called The Orchid Theif, but instead writes himself into the screenplay as the story spins out of control.  Look a little deeper--Kaufman's not just saving face, he's exploring the struggles inherent in storytelling, and eventually finding the reason why he goes to all the troulbe anyway.To tell a story, and to tell it well.  Is it worth doing?  That's the question that Charlie Kaufman must answer if he is going to finish his screenplay.  He struggles, loses hope, finds different angles on the material, but finally gets it right.  Brilliant script, excellent performances--we can forgive Kaufman for being a litle self indulgent, can't we?"
258,Adaptation.,,8 July 2003,A refreshingly clever film,"I watched this film on DVD last night, twice back-to-back. Having done so I was rather surprised to read some of the negative comments posted here and I feel that I should add my bit to redress the balance in the film's favour.I thought it was a refreshingly clever film, full of pleasant surprises and some classic moments and phrases that were simply awe-insipring. A sketch of some of examples of this... I loved the paranoia of Cage's main character, an honest portrayal of a sophisticated middle-aged worried man and his complexities and sensitivities. The conversation with his agent - that he didn't want to make the usual trashy hollywood type film was lovely, I thought. And yet somehow that's what happened: - car chases, love affairs, guns and violence... It was as if it really wanted to be a film for the purist audience but in the end the film, like Kaufman, had to compromise its principles to get it finished and make a sale. I thought the evolutionary aspects were rather beautifully done - like the history of the world in twenty seconds and the fantastic portrayal by LaRoche of how the shape of individual orchid species are linked to an individual insect species. There was a couple of minutes of really profound stuff there that left me cold - and I loved the way the music came in and Meryl Streep was left stunned too - to further underline that point. It was great the way that moments like that were slipped in deliberately to catch you off guard - up until that moment Laroche's excentric charcater had seemed a bit of a Bozo. Another example of this was the way Kaufman's shallow half (I forget his name) surprised his more intellectual brother and, actually saved him from depression with another lovely line - 'It's what you love that makes you, not what loves you' and the very last bit in the film - the quote from The Three - ending ... 'How silly is that? A heart cell hating a lung cell' again, I thought, quite profound. Almost unnoticed in all this was the way that Nicholas Cage played two different guys excellently and the special effects to have them in so many scenes simultaneously but absolutley seemless was impressive. I suppose the only frustration I had was the inplausible way that Meryl Streep's character turned from intelligent sad, druggie to would-be murderer without so much as a word of conversation with Kaufman.
Anyway - enough. I thought it was great and would recommend it to anyone looking for a film that gives you something to think about."
259,Adaptation.,4,6 July 2003,"Despite a great performance by Chris Cooper, a major disappointment","I was looking forward to watching ""Adaptation"".I enjoyed writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze previous collaboration, ""Being John Malkovich."" I took that movie as a twisted, adult version of ""Alice in Wonderland."" It was very imaginative and very entertaining.Throughout ""Adaptation"", I was unwilling to accept the fact of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman essentially wrote himself and his fictitious twin brother into the script. Though I do believe he has every right to do whatever he did to ""adapt"" his screenplay, I believe it was a contrived shell game.I was not impressed with Nicolas Cage. When his annoying character traits not reign in, he becomes a ham on screen. With Cage playing 2 roles, it's a doubly annoying performance. Meryl Streep fares slightly better as writer Susan Orlean. While watching her character, all I though of was the term ""creative license"". In an interview, the real Susan Orlean found her portrayal to be hilariously over-the-top. I'm glad she found her role as hilarious because I didn't.As far as Chris Cooper is concerned, I wish there was a way to re-adapt the story of John Laroche, the character based on Susan Orlean's New Yorker article and her book ""The Orchid Thief."" His character is the most interesting in ""Adaptation."" Whenever Cooper is on the screen as Laroche, he shines. The backstory of why he lost his front teeth was the most dramatic portion of the movie and it was the best portions of this overwritten movie. I though Cooper deserved an Oscar nomination for his role as the ex-marine who lives next door to the Burnhams in ""American Beauty."" Though I'm not a fan of ""Adaptation"", I'm very happy for Cooper's Oscar win.Finally, while watching ""Adaptation"", I couldn't help to think of some better movies where the screenwriter is the main character. Two of them include the underrated Humphrey Bogart suspense thriller ""In A Lonely Place"" (1950) and Robert Altman's dark comedy ""The Player""."
260,Adaptation.,,4 July 2003,Missing the point (spoilers used with reckless abandon),"I don't know exactly how Charlie Kaufman (the real one) went about crafting this script, but it seems to me like he had a sudden epipheny where the entire story flashed before his eyes.  Then, in a frenzy, he wrote it all in one setting.  I don't want to use words like ""brilliant"" or ""genius"" to describe his work, because I think most films that fit that bill are trying to be just that.  I think that Adaptation is just a remarkable coming together of an original script coupled with a couple of career performances. These guys should almost consider themselves lucky they pulled it off so well!I won't even begin to delve into storylines or the myriad levels that Adaptation plays on.  The first half is, as many others have said, a frenetic, but delicate sequence of images overshadowing the story.  Nicolas Cage (the Gary Cooper of our era) gives unquestionably the performance of his career as the twin brothers.  For the first time ever, I watched a film with (insert movie character) played by Nicolas Cage, not Nicolas Cage playing (insert movie character).  Know what I mean?  It's the sign of a great performance.  Chris Cooper is the most deserving Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner since Denzel in Glory.  He exemplifies another sign of a great performance, truly creating a character out of a written script. 
While I was on the edge of my seat (unusual for a black comedy) during the first half, the abrupt turn the film makes had me dumbfounded for a while, and I think this is what, in scanning a number of user and external reviews, many people are missing.  Most of the turns and parallels the story(ies) make throughout are spelled out to a degree.  The biggest one, however, is not.  The first half is art housesque.  The second half is silly Hollywood, and it's intentional.  The first half is Charlie's work, the second half is Charlie's work with ""Donald""'s influence.  Charlie has a lot of good things going with the script, but has nowhere else to go after a while.  But he learns that if you just ""wow 'em in the end"", everything will be fine.  So the bizarre turns the film makes in the second half are self mocking.  You see it in Hollywood all the time.  Changing Lanes comes immediately to mind. You've got all this great buildup, but in the final act, the script zigs and zags all over the place in absurd ways, and you're left with ruin. 
None of this is rocket science and I'm not trying to make some great revelation about Hollywood scripts.  Any hack could write a script that tries to scathe Hollywood by mocking one of its biggest flaws.  The greatness in Adaptation lies in the characters and the framework of the story that Spike Jonze used throughout that pulls it off with such a flare. 
Adaptation is not a revolutionary film like The Matrix, or a brilliant statement about society like The Grapes of Wrath or a great story that had to be told like Schindlers List.  It's a minor gem that could have missed, but hits in a big way."
261,Adaptation.,7,3 July 2003,Funny but not Brilliant as Advertised,"Adaptation is one of those movies that makes you wonder why someone would make such a film.  I have never liked movies about people making the movie you are watching.  It always seems like the writers didn't care, so neither do I.Gripes aside lets get to the good stuff. Nicholas Cage is fantastic in the dual role.  Chris Cooper is funny as can be with his wonderful character, who is also the best written most original character I have seen in years.I enjoyed the movie a lot.  It was so funny I overlooked much of the Spike Jonzness of the movie."
262,Adaptation.,,29 June 2003,I loved it ...at first.,"What a gas! ...at first. It's reminiscent of _Being John Malkovich_ created by the same people. But instead of some fantastical story, it's based on real issues ...at first. The film shows that you can write about any subject and make it brilliant. Cage plays a brooding screen writer Charlie Kaufman who is stricken with neurosis and self-loathing, and in a panic over trying to adapt a book called _The Orchid Thief_. But Kaufman is also a real person, and is in fact the screen writer for this movie. Kaufman has written himself into the film as the main character! Cage also plays his own twin brother who is his antithesis and infinite source of aggravation. So I'm thinking ""brilliant film"", right? (Spoilers follow:) And just then, just like in _American Beauty_ , this perfectly brilliant film leans on the old tired crutch of gratuitous violence, drugs, homicide and man-eating alligators for crying out loud, and I'm hoping that it's not happening; that it's all in the imagination of our main character, who had begun listening to his twin brother's (who is also a screenwriter) simpler, more mainstream tastes. But no, people actually fly through windshields in the story, and get eaten by alligators, and Meryl Streep, for crying out loud, goes homicidal. Regardless of what happened, I'm sticking with my original suspicions; that Charlie is just selling out to his brother's less-sophisticated ideas. I'm thinking the creators of this film are, by selling out to tired devices, are having a little joke on us, just like the rest of Hollywood routinely does. ""The true conflict is not between the characters in a novel, but between author and reader. In the long run, however, it is only the author's private satisfaction that counts.""  --Nabokov"
263,Adaptation.,,30 June 2003,Met a film,"My wife didn't like this film as much as I did.  She feels that Charlie Kaufman has ideas that are big enough for half a film and then he struggles to fill the rest of it.  That's how she felt about Being John Malkovich and Human Nature also.  And, I agree with her to a point, except that I think that maybe that was the point of the ending, to comment on the fact that Hollywood films, in general, put in a lot of fluff at the end to keep the suspense going to smokescreen the absence of substance.This is a film about writing a screenplay about a book that's supposed to be about flowers but is and isn't.  And that's a complex thing to write about. It's about breaking the rules of writing while adhering to rules.  It's about picking which rules of writing to break and which ones not to break. People who feel rules ought not be broken because they're rules won't like this film because this film breaks lots of rules in inelegant and overt ways. It has voice over, flashbacks, and dream-sequences all of which are, according to most screenwriting books, rookie tactics to be avoided at all costs.  It's main character is not only an author, but the actual writer, and it switches genres in a very clumsy, unsubtle way.  All of this it does to make a point, but I'm not going to say what that point is because it would spoil the movie so write me if you want to know what I think the point is (if you don't know already). I liked this film a lot.  I thought it was funny, well-acted, well-written, and well-directed."
264,Adaptation.,9,29 June 2003,"A little confusing at times, but still great!","This is definitely Nicolas Cage's best performance.  I don't know how well Adrian Brody did in The Pianist, but it must have been incredible for him to beat Nicolas Cage for the Best Actor Oscar.  In fact, all the acting in this movie is great.  From Cage to Meryl Streep to Chris Cooper to Brian Cox, not one of them disappoints.Cooper deserved his Supporting Actor Oscar, playing the eccentric John Laroche both passionately and comedicly.  Meryl Streep is a little annoying at times, her character being extremely self-centered, but she still plays it well.And, of course, Kaufman's writing is terrific, blending fact and fiction so well that the audience doesn't know which is which.  I was so baffled as to whether John Laroche, Donald Kaufman and Robert McKee were real people that it made the movie only a little hard to watch sometimes.Great drama, 8.5/10."
265,Adaptation.,,26 June 2003,Cage at his best in a great film.,"Adaptation is the only film so far this year that has been worth the ticket price. the acting is of a high standard, the plot actually holds together (unlike so many films these days), and the characters and narrative have more than one dimension.This is a really good film and an excellent follow-up to the directors' last film, BJM. If you want to watch something that'll keep your attention without needing a truck-load of special effects, then this is it!"
266,Adaptation.,9,26 June 2003,I expected nothing and loved it,"I had no desire whatsoever to see this movie, but then it was nominated for several Academy Awards and critics raved about it, so I figured if everyone else saw it, how can I call myself a movie buff if I don't sit through it? I expected nothing when I rented the DVD, along with 6 other movies.  I saved it for last, assuming I would just fall asleep, but was blown away at the originality and vision of the film.  Though the movie and the story itself were not phenomonal by any means, I was highly impressed with the seemingly manic and ingenius writing.  Also, the acting in Adaptation was extraordinary.  I expect nothing less than spellbinding with Nicolas Cage or Meryl Streep and was not let down.  As others have said, the story itself was lacking, but what many other movie buffs have failed to mention is that the movie isn't really about the book at all.  The movie is about the people - primarily Charlie - and what is meaningful to them.  Kaufman didn't want to make the screenplay a ""Hollywood"" picture, meaning he didn't want to change the book into something it wasn't.  He wanted it to be just the story as it had been told, and that is what Adaptation accomplished.  It is just the story and the man's journey to preserve its integrity.  I really was astounded at how much I enjoyed this movie, especially since I expected it to be another Being John Malkovich (which I desperately hated) or sappy Streep drama."
267,Adaptation.,,23 June 2003,"Brilliant, Complex, Original","If you're looking for something simple and cute that won't make your brain work, this isn't it. ""Adaptation"" is a highly original and thought-provoking movie about an life, humanity, story-telling (and, perhaps to a lesser degree, orchids). I fell in love with the writing, and the cinematography, and Nicholas Cage's acting as twin brothers Donald and Charlie Kaufman is *amazing*. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something new and mentally stimulating."
268,Adaptation.,4,21 June 2003,Boring,"I like weird films, but this one was simply boring. Too bad, because ""Being John Malkovich"" is one of my 5 favorite films. Was it supposed to be a comedy? I didn't laugh. 5/10, I won't go out of my way to see it again, but I might rewatch the ending."
269,Adaptation.,,21 June 2003,Charlie Kaufman is a genius!!!,"This movie is spectacular. Adaptation is the only movie I've ever seen where the script is the star of the movie. A what an amazing script it is. Adaptation is the story of a screenwriters struggle to adapt a non fiction book into a movie. But finally he has an idea to write himself into the script and tell the story of himself trying to adapt the book and the story of Susan Orleans (the author of the book) and John LaRoche (the star of the book) and their relationship together. Hence he is writing the movie that we are watching right now. Its pretty mind boggling. The acting is non surprisingly amazing with a cast of like Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper. Before the movie only Cage and Streep had oscars but although all 3 of them where nominated for this project Chris Cooper is the only one who won. And he certainly deserves it. They're all great but Cooper is the only won you simply lets his character exist. I think this movie is great and i give it 8/10"
270,Adaptation.,,6 September 2003,Hollywood's Surrender,"This movie i a poignant reminder of how Hollywood is heading for a dead end. Apparantly, not even the more intellectual filmmakers over there can avoid the shoot-out and the start of a romance at the ending.
After 'Being John Malkovich', it seemed the road was truly open for new ideas, but this follow-up serves as one big roadblock. But when you've seen 'Adaptation', 'Being John Malkovich' becomes less special - and you realize that the Cage Kaufman is the same person as the Cusack puppeteer and the John Malkovich actor. And this movie is about his same, rather pathetic struggle with his own quirkiness and supposed genius.But where the first movie was surprising and full of fantastic ideas, this one is more realistic - and as such, makes the flaws more apparant. By giving us a look inside his own mind, Kaufman's story trickery becomes sort of a recipe, and reveals that his genius has its limits. At two/third, we learn that the only way he could make this tale interesting was by adding a fictitious brother/alter ego (yawn), a drug intrigue (double yawn), a car crash (gasp), another car crash (sigh!) and - worst of all - a happy ending...."
271,Adaptation.,6,1 April 2003,Ambitious with strong performances but too surreal,"Adaptation' is about Charlie Kaufman, the author of the screenplay of Being John Malkovich' who is now working on a screenplay based on Susan Orlean's book, The Orchid Thief'.  Meanwhile, there is a romantic sub-plot which involves Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) getting to know the orchid collector in her book, John Laroche (Chris Cooper).The recent Oscars ceremony is indicative of the acting talent on show in the film (both Nicholas Cage and Meryl Streep were nominated for their roles in the film and Chris Cooper came away from the ceremony as winner of the Best Supporting Actor award).  Nicholas Cage gives particularly impressive performances as both Charlie and Donald Kaufman. While Donald is brash and confident and embarks upon writing a screenplay himself, Charlie is suffering from writer's block and is convinced that he is incompetent, unattractive and socially inept.  Donald Kaufman is also credited as screenwriter of the film although he does not actually exist in real life.Those who have watched Being John Malkovich' will not be surprised by the unusual premise for the film, as it is indicative of the eccentric and surreal style of Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman. One flaw of the film for me is that it is hard to empathise with Charlie's frustration and the pressure he feels during his attempts to get his ideas on paper.  These feelings are briefly amusing but quickly turn into melodrama.  The film is also let down by the weak and baffling ending (a car chase, shoot-out and some alligators).  I can only assume that these ideas were Donald Kaufman's!"
272,Adaptation.,4,23 February 2003,A reviewer's movie,"This must be the ultimate reviewer's movie. Anyway, they loved it. I myself was terribly disappointed compared to the fabulous ""Malchowich""-movie. Of course the movie plays with intertextuality, but it seems to have strangulated the movie, sadly..."
273,Adaptation.,10,20 February 2003,An adaptation itself in the film industry.,"This film is by far the most brilliantly crafted piece of work I have seen in quite a while.  The film hits every major key point in both the society we live in today, as well as in the past.  It covers a wide variety of issues in a very elaborate, yet very delicate way.  I would recommend that everyone watch this film."
274,Adaptation.,10,20 February 2003,Mind-blowingly clever!,"Although I did not particularly like BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, the same team (Spike Jonze & Charlie Kaufman) have produced ADAPTATION, a strange, charming, and funny comedy about Charlie Kaufman's real-life difficulty (and ultimate failure) in adapting Susan Orlean's novel, THE ORCHID THIEF.Everything you have heard is true. The writing is sharp. Although I never really liked Nicolas Cage, he is wonderful here. Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper are equally enjoyable!It is refreshing, nowadays, to see such a clever little movie getting so much attention. Hopefully, things won't change."
275,Adaptation.,9,18 February 2003,Kaufman and Jonze's launching pad?,"******Warning Spoilers Ahead*******Warning Spoilers**********When I was sitting in the theater and the black screen with the opening titles came on, with Nicholas Cage's voice over, I got that feeling from what he was saying that this movie was something special.  Not just your typical fare, well acted and fed to the critics, but something that you can really bite into.  Needless to say, for the next 2 hours, I was not disappointed.  This movie is filled with some of the most insightful ideas, characters, and acting performances of the season, most notably Charlie Kaufman himself.  The idea for this movie had me calling it the most original screenplay since ""Pulp Fiction,"" and although I know it'll eventually lose to the Best Picture on Oscar night, it would be nice to see Charlie and Donald! taking home the gold.  Chris Cooper is phenomenal...finally exceeding the work as the father in ""American Beauty."" He is comic gold for Kaufman, and he lets the audience know several times outright.  Meryl Streep is very believable, especially her turn...I didn't see it coming...and I didn't see it in her character before.  The directing is top notch...I love the random cut scenes...espcecially the Darwin one and the opening evolutionary scene.  I truly think Kaufman and Jonze are a team that does their best work together, along with the various other members that went along from ""Being John Malkovich"" to ""Adaptation.""  I've seen all 4 Charlie Kaufman movies...These are clearly the two best..and I owe it all to this team.  I can't wait for their next offering, although I am looking forward to the Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey movie ""Eternal Sunshine etc..."" The cast is top notch...and even though the last offering from Kaufman and Gondry -- ""Human Nature"" was the weakest of Kaufman's 4 movies, maybe they'll strike gold this time.  In terms of ""Adaptation,"" if you haven't see it, go out and see it...not just once...not just twice...but see it...then see ""Being John Malkovich"" then see it again!  Well done Charlie!"
276,Adaptation.,10,18 February 2003,the end.,"SPOILER.the main complaint i've heard about this film is the ending. that's too bad, because it's the best part. well, i hesitate to say it's the BEST part, because in my opinion the whole movie is great. but i digress. remember, we are watching a film, about a book being adapted into a screenplay. the exact screenplay of the movie we are watching. so, as the movie progresses we are, in fact, watching the movie being written. the film begins with charlie writing in the isolation of his room. he struggles, wanting to make a simple, elegant film about characters 'not doing much of anything'  and where things dont necessarily work out in the end... which is, not ironically, what we are watching.  all of the while, donald is writing his own screenplay. 'the three'. a typical action/drama/thriller/suspense thing. the exact opposite of what charlie thinks is art. however, donald succeeds, charlie is failing.now to the third act. this is where everyone seems to find fault. i found brilliance. granted i didnt get it at first. but a day later, a light bulb went off. so... its no secret that the third act takes a strange turn. but notice why. charlie makes a desperate call from his hotel room to donald. he wants donald to come to new york to help him finish the screenplay. donald got his screenplay sold, why couldn't he help charlie? again, we are watching the movie being written as we are watching that very same movie. so, up until that point, the movie had been written by charlie.. hence following the 'charlie formula' and things were 'normal'. donald arrives in new york and says 'something is missing' 'we are going to fix your movie bro'. and from that point on, the movie takes a new turn. because donald is writing now! is it any surprise that the movie takes that same action/drama/thriller/ suspense turn that 'the three' features? where things are unbelievable and exaggerated? which COMPLETELY explains the screen writing credit given to donald for the actual movie. i mean, it was supposed to be charlies movie, why else would donald get a credit? that explains the drugs, that explains the violence, that explains the neat and tidy ending that charlie protested at the beginning.and i may be way off base, what do you guys think?"
277,Adaptation.,9,18 February 2003,Multiple Meanings (SPOILER ALERT!),"I am not skilled enough at movie criticism to discuss such a complex film without giving away key points. But then, this movie allows you to choose your key points and make up your own conclusions.Nicolas cage plays screen writer Charlie Kaufman, plus Kaufman's fictitious twin brother Donald. This is a tour-de-force performance, because Cage lets us easily distinguish between the characters solely on mannerisms and character traits. Charlie is charged with the near impossible task of writing a screenplay for the novel The Orchid Thief. Part of the way in, he realizes that the screenplay lies in the writing of the screenplay itself.While this goes on, Donald is writing a hack, by-the-numbers screenplay with no originality called The 3. It is of course, bought in a heartbeat.The movie plays with you joyfully. Jumping timelines and plot lines, mixing fact, fiction and fantasy, never letting you completely in, even Adaptations title is a double-entendre.So, rather than try to explain it, I will strongly recommend this film and give you both my wifes and my own interpretation of the end.2/3 of the way through this film, it turns 90 degrees and lets you draw your own conclusions - here are two of many possible.MAJOR SPOLIERS HEREIN For me, once Charlie goes to Florida, the movie takes a new path. We are no longer watching the writing of the screenplay as was the case in the early film, but we are watching the completed screenplay which represents Charlies sellout. The flower was not a drug, Donald did not die, Susan did not become an addict.For my wife, a much better explanation. Taking her lead from the fact that Donald's screenplay was about three people that were really one, my wife concluded that the entire move was a fantasy, Charlie had no brother and we witnessed a complete fantasy. Somewhat like a lighter A Beautiful Mind. I like this better because it does not make you have to explain out plot holes in my versions.The joy of this movie is that you can ponder on what really happened for days. The movie draws no conclusions. Possible Oscars for all three leads and for the screenplay - it is feasible to see it go four for four on its nominations. **** out of ****."
278,Adaptation.,,18 February 2003,too bad no one will get it,"i wasn't sure if i was entertained or offended by a film which continuously makes fun of the people watching it, other filmmakers, and itself.sometimes i found it entertaining.. esp. quotes like ""multiple personalities are so overdone"" and discussion of how egotistical it was to write yourself into your own film. but sometimes it was just too damn meta.after i realized that just about nobody understood it, it became alternately more funny or more disturbing.it kind of makes me want to hit myself in the head with a sharp object after reading reviews from people who took the ending seriously. hearing my mom say ""well, it really picked up with that surprise ending"" made me want to cry. i went into the film because i was avoiding doing a graphic design assignment. i have no artistic skill to speak of. i was terrified and figured a film might help my mindframe.it definitely did. nothing like being reminded in a simultaneously bitter and amusing fashion that most of what's ""successful"" in film doesn't even try to have any artistic merit. it's hilarious. the very aspects of the film which contained no integrity are the ones which ensured its success. the parts of the film that contain an honest voice and insight are the ones that audience members writing reviews call ""boring""."
279,Adaptation.,,18 February 2003,Not Just a Writer's World,"Charlie Kaufman (Nicholas Cage) sits at his typewriter yearning for inspiration.  His fingers remain still on the keyboard while his mind wanders into self-evaluation and self-criticism.  He wants a cup of coffee. He needs an idea.  A muffin might help.  His identical twin brother, Donald, keeps pestering him with ludicrous ideas for a screenplay that have nothing to do with art but everything to do with pleasing the audience.  Charlie still hasn't poured himself that cup of coffee, he's still balding, and his physique suffers because of all the time he spends sitting and staring at a blank piece of paper.  He still doesn't have an idea.  A banana-nut muffin sounds perfect.Adaptation, adapted from the real Susan Orlean's novel The Orchid Thief by the real Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze, follows the lives of the Kaufman brothers, Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep), and John Laroche (Chris Cooper).  Orlean writes for The New Yorker, and like Charlie, often finds her work painstakingly tedious and unrewarding.  Her literary talents award her success and a comfortable lifestyle,  but she laments the fact that her abilities are void of passion.  She knows how to use the English language, but she doesn't care about her subjects or the people in her life, which makes it impossible for her to find meaning in the world.  She has the aptitude to relate her experiences to her readers through words, but she cannot appreciate her own experiences because she deems these experiences mundane and without significance.  She observes Laroche, a free-spirited Floridian, with condescension for an article she extends into a novel that ultimately becomes the screenplay of Adaptation, but she longs for the ardor he exhibits on his hunts for the Ghost Orchid as much as Charlie longs for his muse to speak.Writers are an eclectic group of people with vastly different ideas, views, abilities, creative processes, and lifestyles, but any writer will quickly empathize with one or all of the writers in this film.  The frequent voice-overs used to reveal Charlie's thoughts, a no-no in writing seminar guru Robert McKee's (Brian Cox) book, are perfect--a conversation or an event always continues on long after its actual conclusion in a writer's head because the `what if' game never ends.  Despite the chronology enforced by actual time, life is not linear.  Some writers believe in art for art's sake--others just want fame and fortune.  Food and personal fantasy are constantly present in the subconscious and frequently impede one's ability to get words down on the page.  The real Kaufman doesn't avoid stereotypes as stereotypes are rooted in truth; many writers are inherently depressed, moody, and never satisfied with themselves or the world around them, but this film resonates so true because the pervasive pessimism does not dominate the story.  The real Kaufman knows writers and how writers think, act, and behave and this visceral understanding of these literary artists provides him with the insight to create memorable characters and memorable situations.The film does not leave audience members grim-faced, but it is an unquestionable dark blend of comedy, drama, and suspense made believable even in its most outrageous moments by an accomplished cast.  Cage's portrayal of the self-conscious Charlie, who is obsessed with what other people think and dismayed by the commercial entertainment industry, breathes life into the depressingly pathetic character; his portrayal of the upbeat Donald, who worships McKee and churns out an empty thriller destined to become a box-office blockbuster, is equally delightful.  The script only required Streep to memorize one character's lines, but her performance demanded the same versatility delivered by Cage and she met the challenge with predictable skill.  Cooper's character is more one-dimensional than the other leads, but his performance is just as commendable and his role provides the script with the action and surprise that leaves audience members anxiously awaiting the real Kaufman's next project.The ending of Adaptation hardly matches the film's overall brilliance, but like the rest of the show, it is honest and provides hope even in less-than-perfect circumstances.  Adaptation doesn't just speak to writers or even beg an audience that is familiar with a writer's mentality; it is a film that has something to say for any person who realizes or who will someday realize that change is not always a choice and that pursuing one's true passion is the only way to live.  Passionate people speak poetically whether they are highly educated or not educated at all, other people don't see sadness in a passionate person's eyes, and public opinion doesn't matter when one pursues one's passion.  Life is good and life has meaning, which procures true happiness, when passion fills the body.  Some people can't imagine living life any other way and others have to adapt themselves to the pursuit of happiness, but this entertaining, heart-breaking, and unpredictable film suggests that it is ultimately the only way to make any sense of this crazy world."
280,Adaptation.,,16 February 2003,Postmodern Masterpiece,"Adaptation is an enjoyable film I would highly recommend.   *SPOILERS BELOW* Charlie Kaufman is having such a difficult time adapting the screenplay because he is so thoroughly postmodern in his worldview.  ""There are no rules"" to writing a screenplay, and in the voiceovers, he cannot even escape his own mind, which is clouded in doubt and angst.  This view contrasts with his brother's modern outlook, who saw rules or ""principles"" as empowering and helpful.   Since Charlie doubts his perceptions and reality, the only thing he cannot doubt is that he must adapt the novel - so the story becomes a story about him writing a story. The Metanarative is device often employed by postmodern story telling, since there is no underlying reality to be communicated.  Charlie is so flummoxed by his inability to find meaning in the book, he attends a screenwriters workshop, where the instructor, Robert McKee shakes Charlie's relativist worldview ""to its core"".  Brian Cox is fantastic in the confrontation and it was my favorite scene in a movie with many stellar performances.  However, the instructor's common formulas and structure for writing a screenplay do not satisfy the postmodern Charlie and he is more lost than ever.  He finally finds a postmodern way through the angst driven fog when his brother reveals to him ""you are not what loves you, but what YOU love"".   In a meaningless, random world, Charlie creates meaning by choosing to love someone who can not love him back.  The act of loving relieves his angst and he is able to finish the screenplay.  I found the resolution to be pretty weak, and would have been more satisfied with an ending where Charlie is made whole (redeemed) and achieves his goal of writing the screenplay, by discovering the importance of real rules, real morals, and a real reality.  Of course, then the entire Metanarative premise of the movie would have been shot down.   Some commentaries suggest both the real and imaginary Charlie Kaufman  ""sold out to Hollywood"" by including the formulaic Drug addiction, Affairs, Manhunt, and Car Crash.   I disagree. Truly selling out would have required writing himself out of the script, and getting rid of the voiceovers, and taking Darwin seriously, rather than mocking him.    Some structure can be added since consistency in not a hallmark of Postmodern Movies."
281,Adaptation.,,17 February 2003,The last act of Adaptation,"Why is everyone hissy fitting over the last act of Adaptation?  Hints were given throughout the movie that it was going to be completely different. Adaptation, an evolution of 8 1/2, becomes funniest during this last part and demonstrates the evolution (or devolution) of story telling.  First, there is reality.  Then an article is written about an incident in reality. The article becomes a book.  The book is adapted into a movie.  Each adaptation requires a change, especially to film.  What is gripping in a book is boring in the pictures.  Elements that may not be obvious in the book are flushed out and expounded upon.  The story evolves, stays fresh.    This is how the oral stories or yester-centuries survived for so long. Bards changed and updated them as the circumstances required.  For Adaptation, an element of crime was added for movie-goer today who just see films as a way to waste time, to justify why they spent $6 bucks to see a 2-hour long movie. Adaptation is flawless.  This is the movie that explains what story telling is all about."
282,Adaptation.,,16 February 2003,Is this movie too intelligent for the common movie-goer?,"Many of the negative comments I've read seem to take this film WAY too seriously.  This wickedly insightful screenplay about the neurotic, BS rules of Hollywood and movie making does precisely what it is supposed to do. Steering off into a completely unexpected final third maintains Kaufman's integrity, not betrays it.  This is unique and intelligent film making. ""Adaptation"" is loaded with dialogue that makes you think and relate.  Like the Coen brothers, Charlie Kaufman gets films made that don't offer pat and simplistic stories.  No, this movie is not for everybody, and I think that's the point."
283,Adaptation.,10,16 February 2003,One of 2002s most talked about motion pictures!,"Adaptation [R] Running Time, 1 Hour: 54 MinutesStarring: Nicolas Cage Meryl Streep Chris Cooper Tilda Swinton Curtis Hanson	Adaptation is one of 2002s most talked about motion pictures for the sheer fact that is has one of the most ingenious scripts that has ever been presented in cinema. Starring Nicolas Cage as both screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, and Donald Kaufman. For those of you out there who don't know Charlie Kaufman, allow me to refresh your memory back to 1999 and a little film called, Being John Malkovich. Being John Malkovich was a film about a puppeteer who finds a mysterious portal that leads into the recesses of actor John Malkovich's head. It was a hilarious romp that elevated screenwriter Kaufman to the top of his class. His unusual, yet incredibly interesting style of writing earned him a nomination for Best Screenplay at the 1999 Academy Awards, and won him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts Award (BAFTA) for Best Screenplay 1999. Among his other credits are the screenplay for the recent George Clooney flick about television icon Chuck Barris, Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind.	One of the most intriguing things to point out is the character of Charlie Kaufman, who is the screenwriter for this film. I find it amusing that Charlie decided to put himself as the main character of his own film. But what's more, the character of Donald Kaufman. Donald does not really exist. Charlie used the idea of having a twin brother to represent a more shallow personality of Charlie's.  The effect is absolutely intriguing. Charlie, whom is portrayed by Nicolas Cage, spends most of the film in a rut, over-analyzing his life. He can't finish an assigned screenplay based on a book about orchid flowers, while his twin brother, also played by Nicolas Cage, is having nothing but beginner's luck writing a clichéd screenplay about a serial killer. This concept proves to very amusing as Donald constantly asks for advice from his troubled brother Charlie. Charlie often gives advice to Donald, but in the form of sarcasm not to be taken seriously. However, Donald loves his brother's ideas. And perhaps Donald is cleverer than Charlie gives him credit for. 	Meryl Streep gives a great performance as the author of a book on wild orchid flowers and a man who finds them fascinating. In fact, Streep was nominated this past week for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Streep has had nothing but critical buzz this year not only for her performance in Adaptation, but also for her performance in The Hours. Streep already won a Golden Globe this year for her performance in Adaptation and the possibility of her taking the Academy Award for the same nomination is likely, considering that both award shows mirror each other to a certain degree.	Chris Cooper, whom you may remember for his shocking performance in American Beauty, gives another magnificent performance here. This guy just has raw talent. I admired his role in another film, 1999s October Sky, in which he played a coal miner. Cooper is being nominated for an Academy Award for his role in Adaptation. Also, he won a Golden Globe Award last month for Best Supporting Actor for Adaptation. Among his other films to note are roles in The Patriot, Me, Myself & Irene, and last year's successful spy flick, The Bourne Identity. 	Spike Jonze is the director of Adaptation. If you can't seem to picture him in your mind, watch Three Kings. He plays the character of Private Conrad Vig, the dimwitted, red neck of the platoon of men who try to steal gold bouillon. You can see Jonze on DVD soon when MTV's hit, Jackass: The Movie, comes out on March 25. Jonze has also directed several films, most notably Being John Malkovich. He is immensely talented and generally chooses films with an offbeat feel to them. 	It was great seeing Adaptation. I needed a break from the big budget films that dominate the market these days. I grow tired of seeing the same rehashed stories, just different settings that we see all the time in film. Adaptation makes for an interesting change in pace in cinema going. If you miss the chance to see this theatrically, catch it on video or DVD, as it's projected release should be in June. ***"
284,Adaptation.,,14 February 2003,"Amazingly good, almost accidentally so...","This film has an amazingly intrigueging plot structure.  It uses a sort of stream of consciousness style, similar to novels like Catch 22.  It is almost as if the actual screenwriter (one Charlie Kaufman) literally wrote the act of writing the screenplay into the movie. Charlie's attempts at romance are so pathetic, it just makes me want to cry and laugh at the same time.  We've all been there before.What is furthermore impressive in this film is the way it flaunts the rules of convention that are even stated in the film.  There IS and overuse of voice-over in the film. There IS an attempt to make a film in which nothing happens to the main character.  What's amazing is that while so gracelessly doing these things, it calls attention to that very fact.  That alone shows a masterful sense of sarcasm.  The film is not above trick devices, but ultimately it delivers more than enough actual content.  I would recommend this film, even if only to see John Laroche's toothless grin (Cooper will get an Oscar).  That alone is worth the price of admission."
285,Adaptation.,,14 February 2003,Caters to the most self-indulgent in Hollywood while pretending to contain original substance,"`Adaptation' is a perfect film for everyone in Hollywood.  It caters to self-indulgent film critics anxious for that all-important disappearing entity called witty dialogue, content need not apply.  It's creators are the same self-indulgent individuals who brought us the much better and more original `Being John Malkovich.'  They assume that they can beat up the average filmgoer with almost two hours of `character development' and then tack on an unbelievable ending that was clearly a case of major writer's block by Kaufman.  Possible Spoilers`Adaptation' begins innocently enough going the route of a documentary by showing some footage from `Being John Malkovich.'  This was an excellent way to begin as many adored that film and felt excited that Kaufman and Jonze would surpass it.  Chris Cooper lights up the screen as the orchid thief and his speech to Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) about how he now abhors fish is something of genius.  There seems to be so much promise but this all ends as the film turns into a typical `thriller' if one can even call it that.I had the pleasure of seeing `Catch Me If You Can' the same day as `Adaptation' and your time would be better served there watching one of Spielberg's most purely entertaining films in years.  The problem with `Adaptation' and let me tell you there are many, is Nicholas Cage.  You don't really like Charlie or Donald and when you finally have the feeling that Donald is a good guy, he dies even though you want it to be Charlie instead.  Nicholas Cage's voice and mannerisms make you hate the personalities of Charlie and Donald and they would have been better served being played by dare I say it, Charlie Kaufman. You also start out liking Susan Orlean but wind up wondering why Meryl Streep would sign up to play a complete bore with a life so dull that she falls for a loser with no teeth and becomes a drug addict dying to hear the sound of a dial tone. Chris Cooper is the most fascinating one involved and is truly deserving of the Academy Award.  I did enjoy the way that Orlean intently followed him around like a sponge hoping to absorb something from his peculiar mind.  He provided what little comic relief there was.  Everyone in Hollywood surely adored Charlie and Donald and the pains of screenwriting, but I didn't.  It was just more of the self-indulgence of Kaufman and everyone else involved.  All that really happens is that Kaufman takes a story about an orchid thief which is actually pretty engaging and tacks on a pathetic ending in a vain attempt to prove that he's original and brilliant.  If the film had been about the orchids it may have been more appealing because the best thing it had going was Chris Cooper.  If you want to see the best film of the year make plans to see `Far From Heaven' instead.6/10"

Got to buy coffee to wash the muffin down, or the muffin will stick in your throat. I should head down to the donut shop and see if they have any blueberry, or maybe even chocolate chip. The waitress there is pretty cute. Boy I'd sure love to wash her down with....GEEZ I hate it when I think like that. What was I working on? Oh yeah, the movie review. ""Adaptation."" Good movie. Got that song running through my head, ""so happy...together...""  Ha ha, good song. And Meryl Streep sure looked cute. Never saw her look cute before. She's always so distant and professional, but in this movie she looks like...someone you could actually go out with. Yeah. Right, I'm done.  Hey Donald, want any muffins?"
289,Adaptation.,,12 February 2003,"The weirdest movie to come out since ""Mulholland Drive"".","This movie is a great movie. Although very peculiar, it is very good. The story is kind of confusing, but it amused me in the theater. The definite highlight of the movie is the acting. Nicolas Cage does a great job as the Kaufman twins, Charlie and Donald. Meryl Streep hands in a fantastic performance as Susan Orlean, the writer of the book Charlie is trying to adapt into a screenplay, ""The Orchid Thief"". The best performance given in the whole movie is Chris Cooper's. He gives he best performance to date as the dirty-looking, weird, partly stupid, orchid thief, who is missing all of his front teeth. The movie is strictly for people who enjoy mind games in the theater. People who like an easy to follow story will hate this movie. Personally, I enjoyed it and apparently the critics raved about it. If you enjoy this movie, be sure to see Kaufman's first film ""Being John Malkovich"". Grade: A-"
290,Adaptation.,10,10 February 2003,A brilliant and imaginative film- the best movie of 2002,"Adaptation. Its a stunning movie filled with beautiful performances from all 3 leads, Cage as the twins, Cooper as the Orchid Thief, and Streep as a novelist. I felt that this film was cheated at the golden globe awards, only winning Best Supporting Actor and Actress. It definitly should have gotten best screenplay (About Schmidt? C' mon!). Although I am not too sure whether or not Chicago deserved to beat it in best musical/ comedy and best actor, but I am sure it did. Anyways to the movie. The plot is listed in many other reviews so I won't list it. But I have to say.. this movie is great. It teaches you about life, love, and literature. Somewhat about self- confidence and about being yourself.The plot can occasionally get confusing but it doesn't distract you from the film. This is Spike Jonze's second ""real"" film, the first being ""Being John Malkovich."" I felt this movie was much better, it was stronger in just about every department. (Both movies are also written by Charlie Kaufman). Overall, Adaptation combines imagination with story telling with acting. Much better then Two Towers or Catch Me if You Can, this movie is the years best. 10/10"
291,Adaptation.,10,8 February 2003,"what an ending, WoOoW","No doubt, one of the best movies of the recent years. Totally unexpected ending and out-standing scripting. N. Cage raelly puts life into the characters. Meryl Streep pulls out another strong performance. And Tilda Swinton looked HOT!!;-) With winderful story ""Adaptation"" is all in all a beautiful, smooth journey."
292,Adaptation.,,10 February 2003,"Funny, interesting film - Cage shines","Nicholas Cage is superb in this film, believeably portraying twin brothers with very different personalities.  The film is less masterful, but still a funny take on the screenwriting process, especially for fans of Charlie Kaufman (who is one of the twin brothers portrayed by Cage).  The script bashes the Hollywood production mill as tactfully as it lampoons the anguish of Kaufman as he tries to wring a screenplay from a ""book about flowers."" Many funny moments.  Well worth seeing."
293,Adaptation.,9,5 February 2003,"An amazing, reality-twisting film","Spike Jonze is quickly gaining my respect.  The quirky and enjoyable ""Being John Malkovich"" was a good movie; this is a great one.  This film challenges traditional ideas about Hollywood screen fare, and does so successfully. Cage and Streep are both excellent; you should see this movie."
294,Adaptation.,8,6 February 2003,An Interesting Mess---,"Nicholas Cage is a mess too, playing a tubby, balding, scared middle aged writer.  His twin is an irritating blowhard.  Both are writing scripts for films.  It gets weirder and stranger as the writer of the book (Merle Streep), and the person she is writing about (Chris Cooper) are shown in flashback and forth.  They are fine as a couple who get deeper into each others lives than really meant to.  I'm not sure if the blowhard brother is real or the imagined other self of the repressed script writer.  It is all a strange and crazy story that I'm not sure I understand.  Cage is puzzling, Streep is unusual, and Cooper is amazing.  I think I need to see it again.  8/10"
295,Adaptation.,,1 February 2003,Donalds not real,"SPOILER ALERT!!!! I felt that Donald was Charlies alter ego and was not a real character.The more Charlie incorporates Donalds ideas the crazier and more unbelievable the story became. The story finally becomes a Hollywood cliche of drugs, sex and death. When Charlie realizes the direction the imaginary Donald has taken him, the only solution is to have Donald die. Thus the accident becomes necessary in order for Charlie to reclaim his screenplay.This allows the movie to end with Charlie smiling, instead of grief stricken, as he would have been had Donald been real."
296,Adaptation.,10,31 January 2003,"My favorite movie of 2002, top oscar candidate.","I enjoyed this movie on many levels. Although I have often seen it categorized as a comedy, I thought it was too clever for that simplistic a label.  It also worked as a mystery, as a nature lesson and a love story of sorts.  The shots of the Ghost Orchid were spectacular.  It was an acting tour-de-force (by Cage and Cooper).  I think it deserves the best picture and best screenplay oscars, and the best actor award would also be in order for Cage and supporting actor for Chris Cooper (as in the Golden Globes). I've seen it three times."
297,Adaptation.,9,3 February 2003,an original movie,"adaptation was one of the best movies i have seen this year and in years past.  nicolas cage did a fantastic job of playing the twin brothers Kaufman , and the rest of the cast was out standing.  the story was great and you never were board with the movie.  The ending is just fantastic and you feel rewarded at the end.  don't wait to go see this movie, see it now because it is worth it."
298,Adaptation.,8,26 January 2003,And then what happens?,"This is a marvel of a movie for 2/3 of its running length.  The story of a screenwriter's efforts to translate an apparently unfilmable book into a screenplay sets up a fascinating, and funny, premise that the film exploits to the hilt.  The movie makes us think and laugh at the same time. Nicolas Cage is wonderful in playing identical twins.But Charlie Kaufman, the film's screenwriter, has written himself into a corner.  There is no way out of his character's film dilemma.  The choice he makes can be seen as a satire and a sad commentary on his character's own failed ideals--but it isn't very satisfying to watch.  On the other hand, if the film spools out as it probably could and should have, there isn't any sort of imaginable conclusion to it because essentially there is no ""movie"" there, or at least nothing like a cinematic story. What there is, perhaps, is ""real life"" rather than ""reel life,"" the life where the climactic encounters we anticipate at work, at home, in love, often prove to be anti-climactic if they ever take place at all.  Can a movie that concludes anti-climactically be made?  The final irony is that this movie's ending, which has nothing but denouements aplenty, feels anti-climactic.A final thought:  I stayed and watched most of the credits but left before the very final copyright frame rolled past. As I drove home, I feared that I'd left too soon, that immediately after that final frame, the film would pick up at the point where it went ""Hollywood"" and finish the film Charlie-Nic was trying to write.  I'll rent the video to make sure, but I suspect that much audacity was just a bit beyond Charlie-Charlie and the film's director, Spike Jonze. Still, a tip of the hat for even planting that doubt in my head.  I'll remember this film for a long time..."
299,Adaptation.,10,26 January 2003,Very Wonderful & Thought-Provoking movie with unexpected twists & turns!,"This is a very entertaining movie.  The whole audience was thrilled, live with appreciation and laughter at the creative wit & adventures / misadventures of the characters.  Adaptation is a movie with very deep meaning, yet simple to enjoy."
300,Adaptation.,6,26 January 2003,"Excellent Story, Excellent Pace, Excellent Acting","I loved this movie.  It's a movie within a movie within a movie.  Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep turn in very strong performances and Chris Cooper is incredible.  The inside jokes are many and keeping everything straight takes some thought.  That's right, this is a movie that makes you think.  I saw it last night and I'm still thinking about this movie.  I highly recommend this movie."
301,Adaptation.,10,26 January 2003,Rave Review,"A fantastic movie with the elements of everything good. Incredibly written, it will leave you wondering about the meaning of it for months! Incredible directing as well. The acting is also just incredible. That's all I can say about it, Incredible, Incredible, Incredible..."
302,Adaptation.,10,1 February 2003,Oscars are coming up and this one is a contender!,"What can i say about this movie! I can not praise it more than i have already. If you haven't seen it yet you definitly should or you will not only miss the movie of the year, but i think of all time! I think all aspects of this movie are perfect, but none more so than Nicolas Cage, and the job he does of nailing not one but two of the main characters in this wounderful mindblowing movie! Visually both of his  characters look the same, but the job he puts in the two characters seem totaly different! Nicolas Cage is perfect and definitly should win the oscar for best actor ( AND ONE FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR FOR HIS TWO CHARACTER EFFORT), Streep is also stunning and could get in the oscar for best actress! Chris Cooper did also do a good job!This movie is made from gold, which CAGE puts alot of it in!"
303,Adaptation.,,29 January 2003,Loved most of it,"This is an original funny and audacious movie and all writer's should have such luck with their writer's block.  My big problem with it is the third-act.  I got the joke, I just didn't enjoy it.  As haywire as the first two acts are, the third act is just completely out of control and kind of ugly.  Still worth the viewing though.  We'll see what happens at awards time."
304,Adaptation.,10,24 January 2003,How many balls can YOU juggle?,"This movie is a breathtaking achievement of screenwriting. From moment to moment we are left wondering exactly what this movie is about and where we stand in relation to the movie.  Are we outsiders watching how a movie gets created?  Are we supposed to empathize with Charlie? Or his brother?  Are we supposed to lose ourselves in the movie, or analyze it from above?  When is it real and when is it fiction?  At each step, we are left guessing where it will go next, except, of course, for the ending, which we could forsee very early on, which is, of course, the point.... or is it?  I saw a review of this movie that said simply:  ""Best. screenplay.  ever."".  I don't know if I'd make that claim, but frankly, I can't think of one better.   And Nicholas Cage gives an amazing performance (two, actually) as Charlie and his brother.  Without changing clothes or hair or any other telltale clues, we can immediately tell them apart.  How?  Attitude, I guess, with their essence, which bubbles through to the screen instantly. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again and again."
305,Adaptation.,8,24 January 2003,Too Smart For Itself,"(some spoilers) The closest analogy I can make with Adaptation is From Dusk Till Dawn.  To explain...Adaptation starts out as a very normal movie.  If you ignore the fact that Charlie Kaufman is writing himself and his fictional brother, the movie just comes off as a weird guy writing a screenplay.  But then it turns strange.  How Susan Orlean and John Laroche can turn murderous so quickly is beyond me.But this is where you are not supposed to ignore that Charlie Kaufman is the writer.  After all, this is the sort of ending that happens in the movie. As Charlie learns while writing the screenplay of the screenplay of the movie we are watching, movies aren't plain and things have to happen. This, of course, is the point and time that the movie we are watching changes. Of course, in the book he's adapting, the movie of the book doesn't have the weird ending, and that's why we see the real-life screenplay movie ending weird, even when the fake book does not end weird.But we all know that this movie is the ultimate in meta and it's not supposed to make much sense.  But then again it makes sense.  But you knew that to begin with, you wouldn't care about this movie if you didn't already know it was crazy and maniacal.I would say that Nicholas Cage did a wonderful job playing the part of Charlie Kaufman, but then again, I have no idea what Charlie Kaufman looks like (an ironic allusion that Kaufman makes of himself when thinking about his time on the set of Being John Malkovich...that is, the Kaufman in the movie, not necessarily the real life one).Meryl Streep gives a decent performance.  I don't get the Golden Globe she got, it wasn't exactly an Earth-shattering performance, I'd consider her performance as ""enough"".  The real big performance comes from Chris Cooper, who did deserve to win the Golden Globe award.  He played a very strange and real character, much different from his other roles.  In fact, he pretty much steals the show.  Nicholas Cage gives his best performance since Leaving Las Vegas, yet he's overshadowed by Chris Cooper's performance and by the fact that you are spending the whole movie trying to figure him out.Overall, I'd say this movie is decent.  It seems like it just tries to be too smart.  Yes, the movie is clever, a movie about the screenwriter of the movie writing the screenplay of a movie using a book written by a character in both movies.  I get it, good show, ol' chap.  That still doesn't mean that it's the best movie of all time.  Adaptation is good, it's entertaining, but it is not superb.  You won't miss anything if you wait for the DVD."
306,Adaptation.,9,22 January 2003,The longer I think about it -- the better it gets,"(spoiler) This is a film that at an earlier time I would have needed someone more experienced to ""interpret"" it for me. It's been a week since I saw it, but still can't get it out of my mind. Adaptation amazed by its unpredictability despite the renlentless logic of the whole. The only thing I guessed was  that the crocodile, in the end, would not go hungary. Nick Cage's performance was a tour de force--I think this was his best work ever."
307,Adaptation.,,22 January 2003,the ending...,"Like a few others, I wasn't overly impressed with the ending.  I felt cheated.  However, when Charlie is meeting Valerie at the beginning of the movie he says - 'I don't want to cram in sex or guns or car chases or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcome obstacles to succeed in the end. The book isn't like that, and life isn't like that, it just isn't.' - In the end, Charlie does everything that he said he wouldn't do.  Realising this, I feel less cheated.  I laughed a lot during this movie and my mind was thoroughly entertained by the cleverness of it all.  I look forward to the next Jonze/Kaufman collaboration."
308,Adaptation.,,20 January 2003,"I don't have a problem with the ending, but...","I saw this film a couple of weeks ago and have since discussed with a number of people. The ending of the film wansn't a problem for anyone I talked to. For me, it has to do with a sense that the characters are/could be real people. Even though ""honesty"" is not quite the correct word, there is something about leaving a number of unanswered questions that brings the film closer to ""real life."" Of course, Orlean and Kaufman and all sorts of other people in the film ARE real people who have gone on living and were mostly in attendance at last night Golden Globes. Even La Roche is still living (said Orlean yesterday on NPR). I am reminded of something Jim Jarmusch says on the new Criterion DVD for ""Down by Law."" He says that the ending of that film, which frustrates many people, is intentional because it was important for him (Jarmusch) that the characters seem ""real,"" that they keep on living AS CHARACTERS beyond the end of the film. It seems to me that ""Adaptation"" does the same thing, albeit differently.The problem that I/some friends have with the film is the use of self-reflexivity, which the film obviously revels in. I don't think that I'd be alone in tracing a good deal of this type of self-reflexivity back to playwrite Bertolt Brecht. What Brecht insisted on, which is lacking in ""Adaptation,"" is that this distancing effect, ""distanciation,"" is used to remind people that they are watching a construction and that they should be thinking about it critically, hopefully as a prelude to social action. I think that ""Adaptation"" successfully distances viewers, as evidenced by the User Comments on this site, but I fail to see any coherent (or jumbled postmodern) set of social critiques that would propel people to act. There is a sort of emotional/psychological message about how we think about our place in the world and how we understand happiness/love/passion, but that seems too apolitical for me to congratulate the film on its deployment of Brechtian effects. Even ""Being John Malkovich"" felt more political to me.
All that said, I actually liked the film a great deal and have recommended it to many friends already, so I recommend it to anyone reading this. It's well worth the long running time, if only for something to think/argue about."
309,Adaptation.,,20 January 2003,"Despite what some say, this is an under-rated movie.","Many of people seem to have missed the point of ""Adaptation.""  The major criticism I hear leveled against it is the segment (Spoilers, of a sort). The movie spends most of the time railing against typical Hollywood formulas, but finds itself ending with a sequence that could have been ripped from any generic crime drama.  Because of this, many folks have said that the film is hypocritical and thus over-rated.  But if you watch the film closely, Kaufman sets up clues to indicate that everything that happens after he meets with the Hollywood screenwriter in the bar doesn't actually happen.  Earlier in the movie Kaufman complains that there is no way to end the story, as it is a series of false starts and disjointed thoughts.  He wants his movie to be like life, where things aren't resolved and people don't learn anything or even necessarily grow.  When he tells the screenwriter these problems, the screenwriter tells Charlie that if he ends the movie with an attention getter, than the audience will over look these (perceived) problems.  The movie really ends at this point, but Kaufman couldn't just stop the movie here, it wouldn't be satisfying for the viewer. Instead, he adds a ""conclusion"" complete with sex, drugs, guns, car chases, touching emotional scenes, and so on.  It serves as a catharsis for the viewer without changing the real ending and the point of the movie.  You need to watch this movie like you are watching a magician; trying to figure out how his magic tricks are done.  Like a magic trick, ""Adaptation"" is all about misdirection.  For that, it's very under-rated."
310,Adaptation.,,20 January 2003,It was brilliant. I notice that some of the reviewers here didn't get it.,"***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** WARNING: This review contains spoilers. This film was brilliant. I must say that for those of you who are saying that the ending was out of character, hackneyed, cliche, etc., that was the point. He sold out in the end. Did you notice how the story turned that way AFTER he attended the hollywood screenwriters class, and the instructor told him he needed to add the drama to his script? It went into the ridiculous plot about the flower being used for drugs, the affair between the author and the orchid thief, the chase scene in the swamp, the dramatic ending with his brother dying. All typical hollywood schlock. In the book, she never finds the flower. That was how his script originally ended, too, as he was attempting to be true to his source material. But in the hollywood ending, it turned out that she did find the flower, had an affair, etc. This movie was a hollywood insiders joke, in a way. It reminded me of Robert Altman's 'The Player'. It has the same idea of exploring the hollywood formula for selling a screenplay, while itself conforming to those cliche's. It was also a brilliant movie. But I think 'Adaptation' did this more cleverly. Just my personal take."
311,Adaptation.,,20 January 2003,"If you didn't 'get' the ending, you won't like the movie.","spoilers below: The clichéd (Hollywood) ending was written by Charlie's brother after Charlie recruited help from him--this in combination with the fascist screenwriter's advice.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out, but if you don't realize this while you're watching, you're apt to believe the end swamp/murder/drug/chase sequence is out of place.  Knowing this and viewing the end sequence reflexively, rather than getting wrapped up in the swamp chase and tear-jerking one-liners allows this works brilliance to shine."
312,Adaptation.,,20 January 2003,Pay attention,"Anyone who doesn't think the ending made sense wasn't paying attention. Adaptation's turn for the absurd is entirely intentionally comedic. It becomes the exact kind of movie that Charlie Kaufman (Cage) was fighting not to make. Car chases, gratuitous sex, violence, sensationalism. The movie is fantastic and hilarious. Pay attention and you'll agree."
313,Adaptation.,9,19 January 2003,Great,"I just saw this movie in the theaters last night and i loved it. i laughed through half of it and shook through the rest. It is a great comedy but an even better drama. It also makes fun of itself throughout the film and doesnt let you take it to serious. Its not until the brutal car crash sequences that the movie became more emotional and it became more like a drama. The characters were great the acting was amazing but the best actor has been overlooked so far who is nicholas cage, he owns the film and makes it great and creates 2 characters that you will love, the only down side to the film is that it is slow at times which i could tell because my girlfriend fell asleep, but she woke up to me jumping when the car crash scene came then she watched the rest and i caught her crying.  This is an amazing film while i still feel LOTR:TWO TOWERS was the best movie this year this film is the best screenplay and acting wise. Go see this and see nicolas cage at his best and see a movie deserving of every award the academy may give it. 9/10"
314,Adaptation.,10,18 January 2003,To sight the films flaws is to have missed the film entirely,"This film is elegant, subtle, obtuse, aggressive, and a complete and utter failure; exactly the plan, I should add. Adaptation is the single example I can think of where every issue in the film is resolved in a happy ending, yet the film admits to having failed the audience and the protagonist. It's a kind of `anti-movie' where you're never sure if the characters are oblivious, `a compliment' Kaufman adds, or methodically engineering a coup of the very studio which allowed this film to be made-a miracle in itself. `Wow them with the ending' it's advised, or just let the film end and eat you alive.for the rest of your life."
315,Adaptation.,7,21 January 2003,"Great acting, some pacing issues","This is a rather bizare tale from the mind of screenwriter Charles Kaufman, who essentialy writes about himself adapting a book... Nicolas Cage in a dual role as Kaufman and his screenwriter brother (a fictional character) is very good as are Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper in supporting roles.. The film does take quite awhile to get going and the early going if often deadly dull but it picks up towards the end and the actors are excellent. GRADE: B"
316,Adaptation.,9,21 January 2003,Thought Process,"Charlie Kaufman is trying to adapt Susan Orlean's book ""The Orchard Thief"", which is a half-truth about her real life, into a movie. The only problem is that her book doesn't contain the whole story, especially after the ending, and there is little to no rising action or exciting things to write about, which makes it hard for Charlie. Charlie and his brother Donald at the end find out what was missing from the book, and both get more than they bargained for.This movie comes from one of the greatest screenwriters of our day, Mr. Kaufman who did Being John Malkovich, this and that are amongst the most original stories of our day. The thought process that went into intertwining the stories is amazing. Everything wraps together at the end in a way nobody expected, and it's quite thrilling and eye catching too.Spike Jonze's direction is pretty good, especially when he speeds up the action showing day and night go by in seconds, with a fitting background. Nicholas Cage is perfect as always, and pulls off being twins who are exact opposites, he has to change his attitude every time the lines change. Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper go together well and the final scenes are led by them.9/10 Starts off slow but quickly picks up, Cage's scenes put a smile on my face as I watched. Cooper and Streep's relationship was interesting. Nice camera work, magnificent screenplay."
317,Adaptation.,,17 January 2003,Don't you get it?!,"I can't believe how many people posting here (and even some published critics) don't get the ending.  I'm reading so much about what a letdown and a failure the third act is.  THAT'S THE JOKE, FOLKS!  This is a comedy!When Charlie, understandably at his wits' end trying to accommodate the Hollywood conceit of adapting a nonfiction book into a linear, structured drama, invites brother Donald to New York to help him, the film becomes the cheap thriller that Donald would write.  What choice has Charlie got? Knowing what Hollywood expects of him, and realizing that the task set before him is not only probably impossible but inherently ridiculous anyway (why must every decent book, no matter the content or style, become a movie?), he simply must deliver.  Doesn't matter if what he delivers is good, it must merely be graspable.  Kaufman and Jonze may seem to be making the audience the butt of their joke, but in fact they are letting us in on the joke, which is this:Writing may be a tortuous process, but writing movies to Hollywood's ""standards"" can be a kaleidoscopically ludicrous process, often pointless, often meaningless, often futile--but that's what the paycheck's for.Charlie adapted, but not toward perfection as Darwin's misleading words have us believe, merely toward a state more suited to surviving in his current environment: Hollywood.  That's what evolution is; not changing for the better but changing to fit in better and therefore last longer.The real Kaufman is a great enough writer to make unsavvy people think he's a lousy writer in the end.  That took guts.  This movie is brilliant from beginning TO END!"
318,Adaptation.,9,16 January 2003,"Proof that Kaufman couldn't have written a better ""Adaptation"" (possible semi-spoilers near end, maybe?)","Most folks agree that this movie is funny and clever. However, there is disagreement about the ""denooiement."" (Hilarious film reference! Ha ha!)Here's my thesis statement, to which I will refer later: Charlie Kaufman brilliantly solved the problem of adapting ""The Orchid Thief"" to the screen in a way that was both honorable and successful. If you think for a minute that he copped out or in any way fell short in the last act, ask yourself this: How could he have done it differently with comparable success?Movies and books are different species of animal, and sometimes there are valid reasons to alter stories that were great as books but are not suited to the screen. This also happens for no good reason, but as we know from the film itself, ""The Orchid Thief"" had to change in some way to become a good movie.Now, to prove my thesis. Here are, I believe, all possible outcomes of any adaptation of ""The Orchid Thief"" to film, followed by my appraisal of their merit in Charlie Kaufman's mind:1) ""The Orchid Thief"" is adapted to the screen in a conventional Hollywood manner, and (whether the finished film is cheesy or great) is fictionalized to the point that it is not true to the book in any meaningful sense. (Not honorable; potentially not artistically sound.)2) ""The Orchid Thief"" is adapted to the screen in a literal manner, and comes off like a documentary, is boring, lacks focus, is strange in a bad way, or some combination of the above. (Not artistically sound.)3) ""The Orchid Thief"" is never adapted to the screen, and remains a very enjoyable book. (This translates to ""Kaufman gives up trying,"" which is not honorable, or at any rate not conducive to future success in his career.) ...and the third possibility, which, lucky for us, is the one that came to fruition:3)Charlie Kaufman gets his brilliant mitts on the story and finds a way to be true to the book AND say something beyond the scope of the book. And he makes an amazingly engrossing and entertaining movie, which:a) Has the last half-hour that it has -- which is not true at all, but which fits logically and artistically, and serves numerous thematic purposes...orb) Ends some other made-up way.There's no way for Kaufman to end the movie *without* departing from the book, unless he goes with possibility number 2 or number 3a.Personally, I vote for 3a. I can't even imagine 3b, and to anyone who can, I say, ""Please, start writing film scripts immediately."""
319,Adaptation.,10,20 January 2003,One of the best!  Certainly the smartest movie in years!,"Please see this movie!How you perceive this movie is your business, Whether you laugh at this magnificent tragedy or are moved to tears by this uproarious satirical comedy you will walk away from this movie knowing you got your money's worth!  I am not trying to be funny.. this is at once the most uncomfortable, edge of your seat, slow, funny, witty, embarrassing, light-hearted feel-good comic tragedy or tragic comedy or romantic depressing farce with a hilarious sad ending..  ARG!  The point is it's intelligent and awesome!  I really am being serious.  If you're curious.. Please see this movie!  If you're not curious.. Please see this movie! Remember, if we don't go to see movies like this then they won't have the courage to make them anymore, then there is nothing left but the ten-thousandth version of the cop-thriller ""The 3"" (you'll understand when you see it). P.S. The acting/directing/technical aspects of this movie are also top notch and in many cases Oscar worthy."
320,Adaptation.,,20 January 2003,STRANGE YET ENTERTAINING,"One of the strangest films I've viewed recently, but it is still extremely entertaining. The characters are oddly very involving and the storyline is very involving as well. Cage is wonderful and totally convincing as are the talented Streep and the slimy character perfomed by Cooper. 9/10"
321,Adaptation.,10,19 January 2003,Yeah...I Like that,This is one of the best films I have ever viewed. The fact that Charlie Kaufman can get anyone to relate to this story is great. I can get a bum off the strret and he will think that it is a great movie. I only wish that I could write about my life the way that he does because that is the way that it is.
322,Adaptation.,8,19 January 2003,Unusual; too long; convoluted.,"Adaptation. (2002) is an unusual movie.  It has the same offbeat quality as ""Being John Malkovich,"" to which it shares many links.It is a story within a story within a story. Nicholas Cage plays a screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, whose brother Donald is also a screenwriter.In fact, the Kaufman brothers were the screenwriters of this movie.  Streep plays Susan Orlean, who has written a book that is to be made into a film.Streep and Cage are excellent, but the movie goes on and on, and the fun washes out of it as events move along.Worth seeing, but not destined to go onto your ""ten favorite films"" list."
323,Adaptation.,,18 January 2003,"The ending, the ending...","I agree with most other comments who criticize this movie. I loved the first hour and a half, but the ending, the ending... Someone suggested that the ending itself is a stroke of genius, since its a criticism of typical Hollywood flicks using that kind of ending. Me, I get reminded of a quote I once read on a Type O Negative album: ""Don't mistake lack of talent for genius"". Of course there MAY be deeper thought in choosing this ending, but honestly, I still feel I'd think better of this movie had it only ended after 90 minutes."
324,Adaptation.,,18 January 2003,Less than the sum of it's parts.,"If movies were only the sum of their parts, ""Adaptation"" would surely be a masterpiece.  Original to the point of audacity and acted to a fare-thee-well by one of the most prestigious casts ever to grace a screen, no one can accuse this one of coming off the assembly line.  It's unfortunate that it doesn't add up to a satisfying experience.Most who find the movie disappointing feel it suffers by going off track in it's final half hour.  There is some truth to this, but I feel the problem runs a bit deeper.  This is a film that tries to have it both ways in too many ways.  It ridicules the world of Hollywood movie making while being so caught up in that world that it never acknowledges a life outside of it. It's self-deprecating humor barely masks how self-congratulatory the endeavor actually is.  This is a movie for the suits in Century City.  I was more than happy to part company with it by the time it ended.This is not to say it doesn't provide moments of interest sprinkled with hearty laughs before it wears itself (and us) out.  But by continually calling attention to how original it is, it grows stale.Kauffman and Jonze might want to take a lesson from Pedro Almodovar, whose current movie, ""Talk To Her"", is far more successful in that it is as involving as it is imaginative.  A five minute sequence of that film blows ""Adaptation"" right out of the water.The actors are all first rate.  Cage is better than he's been in years, though his triumph is a bit of a stunt.  Likewise, Cooper is excellent, even if much of the attention he's received derives from the fact that he took the front caps out of his mouth.  Meryl Streep is hilarious in her most successful comic performance, and Brian Cox should not be overlooked for his spot-on work as screenwriting guru Robert McKee.  For all their good work, though, ""Adaptation"" is not likely to stick with you for very long.An ""E"" for Effort, an ""O"" for Originality, but a C-Plus for ""Adaptation""."
325,Adaptation.,,17 January 2003,amazing work (spoilers scattered throughout),"It's very funny to hear everyone complain about the ending of the movie, and the fact that it's ""cliched"".  If you pay attention, you'll figure out that it is this way for a reason.  The fact that the screenwriters can satirize the typical cliched ending by using a typical cliched ending is sheer brilliance.  This movie is so in-depth and mesmerizing, that it's hard not to pay attention.  But don't fall for the people who say that the ending was cliched.  THAT WAS THE POINT!!!!"
326,Adaptation.,7,17 January 2003,"A little boring, even for an Intellectual","Adaptation has the potential to be great but was a little too slow/boring and too confusing for my taste.  Nicolas Cage did a superb acting job, playing twin brothers, Charlie and Donald Kaufman, with totally different personalities.I thought too much emphasis was put on minor details.  Long scenes about orchards and all the thoughts of Meryl Streep's wish list for life left me confused and somewhat bored.  The movie moved back and forth through each character's thought process leading up to the writing of a script that couldn't get written because each character had a block of some kind.  I hated the ending because lives were destroyed to get to the bottom line, a movie about flowers.Again, the acting was superb, the movie took a long route to get to its destination.  I couldn't help but notice several people nodding off throughout the movie.  I think Adaptation is not for everyone."
327,Adaptation.,7,17 January 2003,I recommend this movie!,"I am a big fan of Meryl Streep (Bridges of Madison County, One True Thing) and have kept abreast with her career. She is one of a kind. She plays Susan Orlean, a journalist who is bored with her work and finds herself fascinated and involved with John Laroche, Chris Cooper (I) (October Sky) who is really a really interesting person. He plays a red neck like no one else. I was in awe with his performance. I did not recognize him. Nicolas Cage (Leaving Las Vegas) plays two people in the movie. Although he is very good. I did not like the characters he plays. They are too weird! I found the movie to be very educational in the area of botany. I was amazed that John Laroche's deep knowledge of several different areas. Since my husband is a biologist from Florida we are likely to purchase the DVD or VHS. I recommend this movie! It is not as fun as Chicago. The acting is really good and is it nice to see the another generation of Coppola's begin to shine."
328,Adaptation.,7,13 January 2003,close but no cigar,"Contains Spoilers Adaptation is a lot like a tomato.  On the outside it seems delicious and nurturing.  It's aroma and appearance and ingredients are all inticing, and there's an excellent performance scattered here or there.  But the inside (the infrastructure of the film) is a different story altogether.  Full of disgusting mucous and seeds (in other words, the makings of a great film), that's all we're presented with.  There's no debating that Spike Jonze is a competent director.  He tries his hardest to give Adaptation a stunning, cutting age look but his shocking oft overbearing ""in yo face"" style (which made music videos like the Beastie Boys' ""Sabotage"" and Fatboy Slim's ""Praise You"" the revered masterpieces of short form music video they are) is out of place.  The first problem i have with this film is the fact that Charlie Kaufman, is too pretentious for his own good.  As we watch the fictional Charlie Kaufman character and his imaginary twin feverishly attempt to discover the meaning of life using a big budget film adaptation of Susan Orlean ""The Orchid Thief"" (a non-fiction study of orchid poachers) the viewer is led on.  One thinks that Kaufman's introspective discovery might help explain the meaning of his own existence, let alone life itself, but it doesn't even do that.  I enjoyed the flashback scenes, but merely for their visual splendor, and their relevance to what could be considered a sub plot, the history of the orchid theif.  The film's final act is the epitome of arrogance.  Kaufman (remember I''m talking about the screenwriter, and not the character who the movie is about) is trying to tell us that there's no place in the hollywood community for ethereal, introspective drama. Which is complete and utter bullshit.  Doesn't this remind you of Barton Fink a tad bit?  An anti-social ""fish out of water"" screenwriter whose commisioned by a big production company to churn out droning bullshit, but he wastes all his time feeling sorry for himself and pounding away at his keyboard, pontificating and spewing inane dramatic points.  The Coen brothers have already cut their teeth in this business, and maybe in the 30s it was difficult to get a screenplay produced if there's a lack of substance and an abundance of depressing images piecing together the neurotic nature of the man writing it, but in this day and age Adaptation has no place. There IS a place in the hollywood community of philosophical films, but they have to relate to already established philosophical concepts, not the babbling, punk rock idiosyncracies of an up and coming screenwriter whose forte in this business has already been established.  He's the guy who go to for a ""weird"" screenplay.  Not an intellectual, inspirational, spiritual, philosophical, psychological concept-fest.  When a person is commisioned to adapt a novel, and it's not exciting it's the author's fault.  Kaufman is trying to say in the 3rd act that the only way to give a film a ""hollywood ending"" is to crush whatever meager character development has been brewing, and completely divert the plotline in the interest of gunplay and chase sequences.  Maybe the image of Charlie singing the Turtles' ""Happy Together"" to his brother as he bleeds to death is cliched, but it works.  If Kaufman (both the character and the screenwriter) wasn't so intent on distinguishing between what he believes is a good film and what he believes is a bad film you'd never know that the final act was a coda.  They might as well have called it Being John Malkovich 2."
329,Adaptation.,10,13 January 2003,Brilliant... Absolutely brilliant.,"Whoever can give this movie below 7 stars is either kidding themselves, didn't really get it, or doesn't know a thing about screenwriting.  This movie's originality is unparalleled. Kaufman's insights into society, witty quips about this and that, and surprising dialogue make this movie a winner. If you are into screenwriting, I recommend purchasing the script, as well, on amazon.com, as it showcases the true talent that Kaufman presents. Intelligent, insightful, and moving!""You are what you love, not what loves you."" -Donald Kaufman"
330,Adaptation.,10,16 January 2003,The best film of 2002...HORRIBLE trailers!,"The best film of 2002... even though it didn't reach us here in the boonies until 2003 :(  The trailers for this film BLOW, because they try to make the film into something it's not - which is a normal, single-genre film. This film goes places I never thought possible, and uses non-chronology better than any film I've seen. Cage is BRILLIANT! He is so raw and believable as both Charlie and Donald. I think that Spike Jonze is on a mission to pull a great performance from everyone who was in Con-Air. Hopefully he'll work with Steve Buscemi next! The writing is simply amazing in Adaptation, and I only hope that Kaufman doesn't EVER get sucked into mainstream Hollywood Hell. Meryl Streep, who is normally the epitome of drama queen, is really great in this film. Chris Cooper is superb as Laroche, finally digging into a character and delivering a believable performance. If there were a dozen more films of this caliber every year, the world (at least, MY world) would be a better place. Thanks!"
331,Adaptation.,,12 January 2003,"Interesting, But Unable to Sustain It","Unusual premise that continues screenwriter Kaufman's trend of bucking the conventional narrative. Like BEING WITH JOHN MALKOVICH it actually works until it loses it's focus and culminates with a rather unsatisfactory conclusion.Here Kaufman actually writes himself into his own story as he examines how difficult it is to adapt a book into a screenplay.  The book by Susan Orleans details a eccentric man and how he scours the earth for a very elusive flower.  It also details her many interviews with him.
The film then pretty much juxtaposes between his frustrations at writing, his personal life, his sexual fantasies, his alter ego (played in the form of his twin brother Donald), and even actual scenes from the book. It sounds very complex, but it really isn't.  The scenes seem to flow together nicely.  For the most part it is actually quite fascinating.The book recreations seem very accurate and believable.  The scenes involving Kaufman are also quite believable and interesting. He shows himself ( and is so well played by Cage) in such a raw and honest way that just about anybody can relate to his insecurities.Of course there are some who have already labled it as just a gimmick. They say it is just a intellectual game made by a insider for other insiders.  There is a certain coldness to it and everything does seem very calculated.  Yet the film does succeed to an extent on it's own theory, which is to bring to the unique quality of the book to life on the screen. Although it is brief it does actually bring you into the world of flowers. You find yourself fascinated with something you never really thought about nor appreciated.The film's biggest letdown comes with it's ending.  He resorts to some incrediably contrived storylines after spending the entire picture saying he hates this and wasn't going to do it.  He apparently just dug himself into too much of a hole and couldn't get himself out of it.  Yet it really was working and had a good momentum.  By coping out so badly he pretty much makes the whole thing look like a big waste of time, which is really unfortunate because the film as a whole is very interesting and even necessary experiment. Kaufman is definately on the right track.  Like with his other films he just has to learn how to finish what he creates.Either way this is a sign that we are truly in a exciting period of filmmaking.  It seems now even Hollywood has accepted the idea that we have to approach things differently.  We can't just recycle all the old ideas that worked before.  We have the test the rules and truly extend the way we make and watch movies."
332,Adaptation.,8,15 January 2003,"Genius, Likely to be Forever Underrated","Soooo many people are not going to ""get"" this movie. It's genius, it's intricate, it's so inside movies that anyone who doesn't work in or study them intricately will probably feel gypped and pandered to and completely miss the point, if they can even muster any interest in the subject matter. It will be lauded by ""film people"" and bashed by critics and Joe Blue Collar. This is the antithesis of ""safe summer blockbusters."" This is the kind of film Hollywood SHOULD be making, if only it was unaware that action films have the potential to make a billion dollars worldwide while Adaptation will be lucky to make $50 million total. Ever. Even in ancillary sales.I won't explain the film. The act of seeing the film is an integral part of the process; this is almost a multimedia, virtual reality experiment. Suffice it to say that Charlie Kaufman's story of how he attempted to turn ""The Orchid Thief"" into a film is not only a near-perfect example of the creative process in all its unsexy glory, but also a mindbending, genre-bending deconstruction and analysis of film all at once. This should be shown in film classes for years to come. This film IS a film class.And yes, those of you who see the end and think Charlie's sold out, or that you've been screwed? He has, and you have. That's the point, and the fact that Hollywood wouldn't have it any other way makes this film a scathing indictment of its own medium as well."
333,Adaptation.,,14 January 2003,"This film, like the swamp, is all wet.","""Adaptation"" suffers from two fatal flaws. First, it uses fine actors to play roles that ultimately fail to captivate. Nicholas Cage's performance, as Charles Kaufman and his twin brother Donald -- who does not exist in real life -- is marred by the fact that Charles is a totally unsympathetic character. The man doesn't even like himself! Meryl Streep could have been replaced by virtually any actress as author Susan Orlean. Only Chris Cooper combines acting skill and a winning character. He truly blossoms as John Laroche, the orchid thief gone to seed.Second, ""Adaptation"" is too clever for its own good. The core idea is interesting enough: Change is necessary and inevitable, in nature, human existence or film. Inability to change leads to extinct species, stunted human beings and Hollywood schlock. Unfortunately, screenwriter Charles Kaufman bears out his assertion by producing exactly that: godawful Hollywood dreck with a boring, cliche-ridden last half-hour.In the final analysis, ""Adaptation"", like the swap, is all wet. It's a pity Kaufman merely serves up trivial platitudes about life in Hollywood, instead of profound observations about life on Earth."
334,Adaptation.,,10 January 2003,Bombastic Contortionism,"If you saw ""Being John Malkovich"", you probably knew to expect that ""Adaptation"" is about being clever. This time around, the story concerns an artist, a narcissistic screenwriter, who suffers from a lack of narrative ability. As the title suggests, he will 'change' at some point, having evolved past his disappointment into a creature of complacency -- god help the audience if they don't follow his example.  All this, while devising a third-act that devours its own pointless tail.We are predestined to care nothing for the characters in ""Adaptation""; shame on us if we do, they are cliched fabrications, merely present as something of a self-deprecatory jab at Charlie Kaufman, who is himself a cliche many viewers will have empathy for.There is nothing new about the visual storytelling in this film.  Nothing profound that is unearthed beneath the many 'layers' of self-referential babble. It is, at its core, an idiot's guide to cleverness."
335,Adaptation.,,10 January 2003,my interpretation (spoiler),"My two cents:The ending sequence of the movie, from the time Charlie and Donald start spying on Susan until the end, seems to confuse many viewers.  Other than representing some kind of personal breakthrough for Charlie - to rid himself of the fictional Donald, integrating and/or expunging those parts of himself - this part of the film, I believe, is actually Donald's addition to the script that we are inside.  That is, ""Adaptation"", the movie currently in theaters, is a realization of the script that Charlie is writing in the movie.  Kind of an M.C. Escher-like hand-drawing-itself thing.  So when we get to that part of the film, we have entered ""Donald's"" contribution to the stalled script.  That's why the sudden ramping up of sex, drugs and violence.  That's why the bad moments of cliched dialogue and the ""Happy Together"" bits with Donald's death and the very end.  That's why the reunion with the woman, the tearful call to Mom, Charlie's personal epiphanies, etc...these are all terrible Hollywood conventions that the real-life Jonze and Kaufman are making fun of.  What's unusual about the film is that they never reveal this last level of satire, which seems to therefore befuddle most people since they don't make it as obvious as it could be.When the movie ended in the theater I saw it in, there was a palpable sense of disappointment and confusion among the other people in the audience. Now, if the joke is on the audience, and the audience doesn't get it, is it still a good joke?  I'll tell you one thing: it's a brave joke, and why Adaptation is an even smarter, riskier movie than most critics realize."
336,Adaptation.,6,12 January 2003,Disappointing,"Orchid lovers might find something in this film to inspire them.  Frankly I was disappointed.  Film critics rated it so highly in the press. I must have missed something. May be I took it too seriously.  May be I took it too literally and overlooked some hidden satirical elements.  Even so I don't think this film will win an academy award for BEST FILM.  The constant flashbacks and flashforwards I found decidely annoying and I am still not sure if it was meant to be funny.The film plods along rather slowly as a writer seeks inspiration to adapt a book as a screen play.  It's about flowers and the writer is finding it rather difficult to get some drama into it.  I suppose it was his constant failure to accomplish anything that tended to bore me. It seems that the writer's brother (or was he his alter ego) was doing much better with his ""blood and guts"" murder thrillers.At the point where the film continues to drag along there is an unexpected and very realistic car crash.  It didn't have anything to dowith the story with the story, but that didn't matter. It literally made me jump in my seat and brought me to my senses which were beginning to flag.Nicholas Cage plays a dual role as Charlie and Donald, and he does it extremely well. The current technology which is able to bring the two characters face to face on the screen is intriguing. Chris Cooper who plays the part of John Laroche, a disreputable character who is on to anything that brings in some money be it orchid stealing or porn on the internet.  I thought he ran away with top acting honours. He should get an academy award for his truly remarkable and believable characterisation.Apparently some orchids grow in very watery environments which gave the film an excuse to introduce a crocodile infested swamp. It also provides a means of removing one of the characters when most of the action is over.In my opinion this film comes nowhere near ""Being John Malkovich"". The critics may rave and rave and we cannot prove them wrong.  But it seems rather significant that this film is soon forgotten."
337,Adaptation.,9,12 January 2003,Stimulating,"One of the more thought-provoking movies in a long time.  N. Cage has one of his best roles ever, and makes the most of it.  He deserves a nomination for an Oscar, as does M. Steep and C. Cooper.  Very original, strange but one of those movies that actually challenges you to think about life, all our options and opportunities in life and how we use them or let them slide by.Oh by the way, it's also very funny!  Very clever to start while ""Being John Malkovich"" is still being filmed."
338,Adaptation.,,12 January 2003,See this film to experience passionate cinema at its best.,"If you've ever written for publication or tried, Spike Jonze's `Adaptation' is the best film I've seen since `Barton Fink' to depict writer's block. The joy of the creation is a Darwinian journey from the writer's primal self through the swamp of emotions and yearnings to the expulsion of his worse self and the birth of his voice. Barton fink went through a literal hell to get it as well.Writer Charlie Kaufman (`Being John Malkovich'), played Oscarly by Nicholas Cage, depicts himself as the writer of his own film, `Adaptation,' tortured through an initial assignment to write about an eccentric orchid lover, John Laroche, played by Chris Cooper also in Oscar-worthy style, and his biographer, Susan Orlean, played by Meryl Streep, for once not the match of her colleagues. Cage fulfills the promise of his `Leaving Las Vegas' winning role by playing both Charlie and his alter-ego brother, Donald.  As brothers sometime tend to be, both are half of a whole person, Charlie nerdy and introverted, Donald hip but shallow and extroverted.  Cooper plays the front-toothless Laroche with depth of feeling and intellect wrapped in a Florida Riviera red-neck mien.The real attention goes, however, to the process of writing.  As Charlie looks at his typewriter for inspiration, his voiceover negotiates for coffee and a muffin, but only after he writes his introduction.  This authenticity, understood by anyone trying to kick start the process (I needed hot chocolate and the right chair to begin this review), is palpable.The quest for the elusive orchid in the swamp is a natural metaphor for the beauty that may be found among the muck and danger of this writing grail quest. Appropriately, Charlie must also strike out boldly to win the heart of a woman whom he has hesitated to approach until he has gone through his swamp of initiation.  Indeed, their kiss is the most romantic part of an otherwise uncompromisingly real, albeit artful, depiction of the lonely creative act.In `The Hours,' my other favorite film of the year, Virginia Woolf's writing and life propel some to the brink of suicide; in `Adaptation,' Kaufman delivers everyone from the `slough of despond' to create a brilliant film we are at the same time experiencing.  The need to be passionate about something is a sub theme: See this film to experience passionate cinema at its best."
339,Adaptation.,,11 January 2003,They didn't quite pull it off!,"Judging by all of the critic's awards this year, 'Adaptation' is probably going to win the Oscar for screenplay adaptation even though it doesn't deserve to.  It is a unique take on another medium aside from film and the film itself is extremely well acted by Nicolas Cage and Chris Cooper and Meryl Streep turn in good work as well.  Unfortunately, the film takes a sharp, bizarre and unexpected turn in the last half hour and the criminal tendencies of some of its characters is totally bogus and has the 'red herring' effect which is taboo for writers.  For those of you unfamiliar with the term 'red herring', it means throwing the audience a curve ball with absolutely no clue that it's coming.  Good writing always, even in the slightest terms, puts the audience ahead of the story and 'Adaptation' fails to do this.  Director Spike Jonze has a brash but ultimately hollow vision of his subject matter and 1999's 'Being John Malkovich' was one of the most over rated films in years.  Writer Charlie Kaufman has some good pages in his script but this picture stops short of being great and only Nicolas Cage truly stands out, playing twin brothers.  And he should earn an Oscar nomination for his work and could be the surprise winner."
340,Adaptation.,,11 January 2003,Hum,"I don't know if many people ""got"" this movie, but I'd like to give my own point of view.--- SPOILERS ---The first part is Charlie's scenario, and the last part is Donald's scenario.. You see a car chase, a killer which is a man AND a woman, but since you can't see both at the same moment, they had to put both, and the dual personality is of course, the TWINS.This is why the end is so different from the rest of the movie, the authors were trying to show us an hollywood ending, with a happy ending...The author in the movie tries to avoid any Hollywood clichés, but finally ends up doing one himself.. which is the cynism in that movie..I must say, it's a weird movie, but I was laughing many times at Cage's caracters, it's a truly BRILLANT performance for Nicolas Cage, and I'm really happy for him..I saw many people leave the theatre before the end, seems they weren't aware of what they were going to see.. if you have seen Being John Malkhovic (sp?), you know what to expect.."
341,Adaptation.,9,11 January 2003,Flowers and Flo & Eddie,"Greetings again from the darkness.  What a delightful experience when everything clicks with a filmmaker, the cast and the script.  Such is ""Adaptation"".  Of course, ""Adaptation"" is actually about just the opposite. Charlie's pain as he attempts to adapt Susan Orlean's novel, ""The Orchid Thief"" seems very realistic.  A writer wanting to stay true to the subject and himself is often the goal and rarely the result.  Hollywood power shines through with Nicholas Cage in a truly superb dual role (Kaufman brothers) and the incomparable Meryl Streep as Orlean.  The power of these two is never greater than when Chris Cooper (""American Beauty"") is allowed to take over.  Cooper chews the scenes as LaRoche like very few can.  He delivers in arguably the most crucial role to the film.  Strong support from veteran Brian Cox, Maggie Gylenhaal (""Secretary"") and Cara Seymour, who is quite intriguing as Amelia.  Looking forward to more from her.  The soul searching and doubt Charlie experiences takes us to places writers must travel.  It is not always a pleasant experience, but that is what seperates the real writers.  Gotta love his reactions to the Hollywood blockbuster stereotypes that his brother churns out.  Anyway, after ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"", I would like to go ahead and purchase a ticket for the next Spike Jonze/Charlie Kaufman film.  Keep it going guys - we are counting on you."
342,Adaptation.,9,11 January 2003,"The more I think about it, the better it gets.","9 of 10Which isn't to say it wasn't enjoyable watching, just that it gets better as you ponder it.As advertised, story and acting are great.  Bonus:  some impressively seamless FX."
343,Adaptation.,,5 January 2003,"ORIGINAL, INSPIRATIONAL & HILARIOUS","ADAPTATIONOscar winning director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman of Being John Malkovich team up again for another truly original movie, starring Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper.  Charlie Kaufman once again successfully combines his bizarre comedy with true to life dilemmas in this self-reflexive tale. Nicolas Cage plays a dual role in this film, he stars as Charlie Kaufman and as his twin brother Donald Kaufman (similar to what Eddie Murphy did in The Nutty Professor).  Essentially, the story is about screenwriter Charlie Kaufman who just coming off of his latest brilliant film Being John Malkovich and is approached by a studio rep to adapt the novel The Orchid Thief written by Susan Orlean, played by Meryl Streep. Susan is New York reporter who had written an article on John Laroche, (Chris Cooper) an odd loner-type who had found a way around the laws governing endangered plants, one of which being the Ghost Orchid, an extremely rare beautiful flower.  However, Charlie has found Susan's novel nearly impossible to adapt into a screenplay and thus constantly struggles for inspiration.  Meanwhile, Charlie's twin brother Donald has found new inspiration in Charlie's success as a screenwriter.  Assuming it to be quite easy, Donald embarks on his own script, filled with more cliches and contrivances than any Jerry Bruckheimer film could ever imagine.  Through much trial and tribulation, Charlie ends up writing himself into his own script and things only get more unpredictable from there. A confusing plot to explain, maybe, however director Spike Jonze does a wonder job of keeping things clear and letting the story unfold before your eyes.  Adaptation is an extremely entertaining film, its story is completely refreshing and once again the director's craft is more than inspiring.   I give this film an A, anyone who enjoyed Being John Malkovich or who just has a soft spot for original wacky entertainment"
344,Adaptation.,10,2 January 2003,"Refreshing, quirky - I dislike pretentious summaries!","I am in awe of this movie.  From the beginning I was linked to this film simply because Kaufman breathed life into thoughts I've had in my mind a long time, as I'm sure many do.  This is not a puzzling movie, and it does not pretend to be.  The plot is evident and intriguing - I never felt there was a slow moment in the film.  The development of the characters was very well-timed and I was provided insight on an as-needed basis.  Nick Cage is brilliant in his depiction of Charlie Kaufman and his (fictional) twin brother Donald.  I wasn't at first impressed with Meryl Streep's performance until more towards the end (there was that time though, when the Indian complimented her hair).  Chris Cooper, in my opinion, definitely deserves a Best Supporting Actor nod - if he had any more screen time in the film I'd say a Best Actor nod!  His depiction of John Laroche was gritty, unconventional and fascinating.  I, along with Susan Orlean, (Streep) longed to know what it was like to be so focused on one subject so passionately (No more fish!).  One surprising note - when I saw this film in the theater it was packed, and not one person talked during the movie - the only sounds that came from the audience was laughter at certain times - it was as if we were hanging onto every word - it was very refreshing! This was a fantastic movie that provided opportunity for the viewer to look introspectively - and ever since I saw it I cannot seem to get the quote from Donald Kaufman out of my head ""We are what we love, not what loves us."""
345,Adaptation.,5,2 January 2003,Well written but pretentious,"I must admit that Adaptation was very well written and was genuinely funny. My gripe with the film is that it is pretentious hollywood film about how clever they can be to write a movie about the movie that you are watching. It is like watching the making of a making of a bad movie.  There just wasn't any substance to it.  I left the theater feeling nothing, I didn't care what happened to all the characters at the end, I just wanted it to finish."
346,Adaptation.,,31 December 2002,It's the Massage,"Just thoroughly enjoyed the movie and read several IMDB comments. To me, the movie provided a message of people falsely trying to achieve satisfaction in life through the pursuit of unattainable goals. Merryl wanted happiness through an illusion of passion for things which she thought had fulfilled Chris - both repeatedly went down that wrong path. The bumbling Donald's spirit of not worrying what others think about you, but having concern for his brother and others, was the underlying message. The real Orchid Thief is our individuals ego satifsfaction through material desire or passion. Through an ingenious plot, the movie dramatized the need to care for others, and not worry about how others care about you."
347,Adaptation.,5,31 December 2002,A bold disappointment,"Because Justice, in all her blind wisdom, does occasionally make a surprise appearance at the Academy Awards, there is reason to hope that Chris Cooper will take home this year's Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. What he does in ""Adaptation"" as John Laroche, the orchid thief, is just amazing. He convinces us that this grimy, toothless, possibly insane naturalist is, as he puts it, the smartest person he knows. If you knew him, he might be the smartest person you knew as well, and the most defiantly passionate. He is a great screen character, a scientist with an artist's heart and a redneck persona, and it seems impossible that anyone but Cooper could play him so well. There are, in fact, a number of very smart people associated with ""Adaptation,"" but insofar as their smarts were put on display for this particular project, Cooper and Laroche are the only ones who come away with much in the way of bragging rights.Susan Orlean (convincingly played in the movie by Meryl Streep) saw in Laroche's life a story that needed telling, wrote the book, `The Orchid Thief,' and was smart enough to simply be in awe of Laroche and his capacity for obsession. The story that needs to be told is Laroche's, and Orlean gets credit for not being among those who completely bungled that notion.Charlie Kaufman, the writer and central figure of ""Adaptation,"" and Spike Jonze, its director, are smart men as well. Exhibit A: their previous film, ""Being John Malkovich,"" a hilarious, pop mind-bender of a movie that illuminated the desire lurking in the modern, collective subconscious not just to be famous, but to be someone who is famous already ­ specifically, to be Malkovich in his private moments, brushing his teeth, or getting laid. `Malkovich' is one of the few true classics of our times, so Jonze's and especially Kaufman's complete fumbling of the ball in ""Adaptation"" is, for my money, the heaviest disappointment of the year.The premise of the film, as everyone knows by now, is that Kaufman is given the assignment of adapting Orlean's book into a screenplay but, finding himself stymied by the material, instead winds up writing the story of the adaptation itself, creating a movie in which the audience is treated to the story of the movie's own creation. It's a high-wire idea, rich with potential for the kind of cerebral loop-de-loops with which Jonze and Kaufman drew `Malkovich' so brilliantly, but which in this case went almost entirely unfulfilled.As Kaufman makes clear throughout his own script, in ways that are both articulated by his onscreen persona (played by Nicholas Cage) and evident in the movie's key failures, `The Orchid Thief' is simply too emotional and ephemeral a piece of material for his own particular strengths. At one point, Kaufman begs his agent to let him off the project, and the agent warns him that it would be a disastrous career move. It's probably a fool's game to try and guess which events in `Adaptation' are fabrications and which were taken directly from real life, but it's tempting to believe that this dialogue really happened, because the movie feels most honest when Kaufman admits to not being up to the task.The problem is, he never did rise to the occasion, and as he tells us point blank in his meta-fictionalized account, he cheated by putting himself into his own screenplay, and then cheated further by fictionalizing even that story, going so far as to invent a twin brother for himself ­ an alter ego whose dim wits and billowy confidence are there to accentuate all of Charlie's neuroses and steadfast principles. Even as I relate these details, they strike me as brilliant ideas. Unfortunately, Kaufman fell victim to an age-old writer's trap: that to have a brilliant idea is the same thing as making the idea work. He did one but not the other. Like a clever college student who didn't do any of the necessary research for an assignment, Kaufman instead wrote a movie of lies and excuses about why he couldn't do the job he was given, and presumably he then hid somewhere, sweating profusely, fingers crossed, hoping we would buy it.He can stop sweating now, I guess. Critics are mostly wowed. People who I know personally, and whose opinions I highly respect, love the film. Mike Nichols wrote something in the L.A. Times yesterday, which I have yet to read, but which I hear is very enthusiastic. ""Adaptation"" will certainly find its audience, but I'm afraid I'm not among them.For the first two thirds of the movie, I was playing along. Even if it wasn't as emotionally involving as I'd have liked, the dialogue was funny, and I was even buying into the meta-premise. For the record, I love meta-fiction, the novels of Salman Rushdie being the best example I can think of.SPOILERS FOLLOWHowever, in the last act, the bottom of the bag gave out and spilled the damned movie all over the street. Kaufman, finally frustrated beyond all hope with the difficult nature of Orleans' material and taunted by the huge success of his fictional twin brother's hack Hollywood screenplay, throws art to the dogs and decides to end his script in the usual, commercial fashion, throwing into the kitchen sink all the old sawhorses he claims to despise: car chases, gunplay, the overcoming of personal obstacles, life lessons. It's a joke with great potential, except for one thing: we already care about the story of the orchid thief, and we don't so much about Kaufman's.And as if to defy our sincere interest in Laroche and Orlean, whose story he was supposed to be telling, he races all his characters through a gauntlet of cliché (deliberately, I realize) toward his anti-denouement. The problem is, the entire last third does nothing but satisfy that one joke. He apparently thought the conceit itself would serve, and so he drew it as one, broad stroke. Nothing that actually happens in it -- not the drugs, not the guns, not the sex, nor the shattering glass -- plays any role in anyone's story. Once you get the joke, which is shortly after the third act starts, the joke is over, and the movie is robbed of any truly satisfying conclusion. All it does is illustrate that Charlie gave up, and then tried desperately to put a humorous spin on his failure."
348,Adaptation.,10,31 December 2002,Fantastic film,"I laughed so much during this movie, I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. But I'm a pretentious fop who really loved The Royal Tennebaums and Rushmore and Being John Malkovich.  Of course, my favorite movie of all time is Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.  Suffice to say, I recommend this movie to anyone that can remove the stick from their ass to enjoy a movie that takes thought."
349,Adaptation.,,30 December 2002,one-line summaries are idiotic,"I've heard it said that this movie is a 'postmodern gimmick.'  Some of you have said that the last third of the movie falls apart, that's it's an obvious, tedious ploy to make the end of the movie everything Charlie rails against in the first two-thirds.  How overly *clever* you think it is, but you saw through it ... right?None of this could be farther from the truth.  _Adaptation_ has beautiful structure, and symmetry, and pattern, and patterns-within-patterns and meta-patterns.  This mathematically precise, detailed patterning is the antithesis of po-mo-style deconstructionism.  So no matter what else, the movie _Adaptation_ is undeniably not post-modern.  And I mean that as a compliment.  It may be true that a CHARACTER in the movie has certain post modern, structureless ideals, but come on people!  That's just a character's desire.  You can't deny the structuredness of _Adaptation_.Now, for those of you who 'saw through' the cleverness of the last third or last 20 minutes of the movie ... who realized that the end was a ""Donald-ending,"" that Charlie gave up somewhere and sold out...  The WHOLE MOVIE was a DONALD-movie!!!  Not just the ending -- from the first word to the last word, the movie works both ways (at least).  Nothing makes the end stand out in this respect.So the irony here is: some people a) think the ending was different from the beginning because it was more Donald and less Charlie, b) speak condescendingly of the cleverness they 'saw through,' and c) were annoyed at the obviousness and tedium of the 3rd act.So, the people who are dismissive of this movie's cleverness are the ones who missed most of it -- until it was hammered into their skull by the very ""idiot-crowd-pleasing"" ending they ridicule!If you think you figured out the 'one trick' of the movie and were bored after you 'got it' ... ya didn't get it.  This is good news though --it means you could fruitfully enjoy another viewing or three and be delighted at what you continue to discover.  There are many tricks up _Adaptation_'s sleeve.  Go and learn.If you have nothing else to do, figure out how Charlie's audiotapes end. The playback was always cut off, but something logically follows.  It's only implied in the movie, but then again, it only needs to be..."
350,Adaptation.,,6 January 2003,Modernism for the masses.,"Spike Jonze's `Adaptation' uses famous actors to attract a general audience to a tricky, inventive movie, which is what his `Being John Malkovich' did. This time the dice are more loaded since on hand are Nicolas Cage (twice over) and Meryl Streep, not to mention a cameo by Malkovich and a strong appearance by Brian Cox, with an outstanding Chris Cooper, and with Tilda Swinton, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and other fine players on hand---as if Cage and Streep couldn't carry the day. As vivid as the acting is, though, this is not a matter of star turns but, in the jargon the movie uses, totally `story-driven.'`Adaptation' presents the classic modernist theme of self-reflexive fiction: a writer writing about the process of writing--in this case, a screenwriter writing about his inability to do a screen adaptation of a book. If the topic is how to make a dull subject into an enjoyable movie, Jonze and Kaufman have an answer here, because---at least for three quarters of the way, `Adaptation' is lots of fun. For extra flavor the book Kaufman's been assigned is a hard one to adapt, because it's an `expansive New Yorker style story,' itself self-reflexive and without a conventional `arc.'  A character study of an odd, interesting man, it's a real book about a real person, Susan Orlean's `The Orchid Thief,' which did first appear in The New Yorker and describes a rogue horticulturalist in Florida named John Laroche. 
The fictional screenwriter, by the way, is the actual one, Jonze's collaborator here and on `Being John Malkovich,' Charlie Kaufman.  Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) is stuck in Hollywood with a deadline and writer's cramp, much like Barton Fink in the Coen Brothers' movie of the same name. 
A new wrinkle is that he has as a kind of upbeat alter ego, Donald, a twin brother boarding with him and deciding he too wants to be a screenwriter. While Charlie agonizes, Donald happily adopts a conventional theme (a murder thriller) and cookbook methods taught him at a screenplay-writing seminar, and sells his screenplay through Charlie's agent for big money.  Meanwhile much of the focus is on how Charlie writhes and sweats and brings forth nothing. This rather static process is enlivened by cross cutting between the Kaufman brothers' story and the earlier adventure of Susan Orlean's (Meryl Streep's) work on `The Orchid Thief,' the book Charlie has been hired to adapt.  At the heart of the film is Orlean's relationship with John Laroche, (Chris Cooper), the seedy but brilliant horticulturalist whose wild life lead to the theft of hundreds of rare orchids in Florida.  The problem for Charlie Kaufman is that colorful as Laroche is, and interesting as Orlean's study of him was, there's no conventional movie ending provided by the book.  Charlie also learns that there was no greater intimacy between Orlean and Laroche than any good nonfiction writer's close connection to her subject, which ended when the book was done.   The more we learn about `The Orchid Thief' as its subject and its creation come to life before our eyes, the more we understand why Charlie is stymied about how to make this into a screenplay.What makes the movie work for us most of the way is witty writing, lively cross cutting, and good acting to give the writing substance.  In the `Orchid Thief' segments, we're continually entertained by Chris Cooper's supple impersonation of Laroche, who's wonderfully quirky and sexy, despite lacking his front teeth, as well as by Streep's appealing and delicate performance as a talented writer drawn increasingly to Laroche because he has a passion she lacks.  It's also fun in the alternating segments to observe the oddity of an actor (like Jeremy Irons in Cronenberg's creepy `Dead Ringers') playing twins who're together chatting in scene after scene, delineating the contrasts between Charlie and Donald without any differences in physical appearance.  Of course we know it's a trick, but it's fair to say we come to accept that we're watching two brothers, because the filmmaking is so deadpan, and Cage is so engaged in his task.The movie's turning point comes when in desperation Charlie attends a New York workshop by Robert McKee (Brian Cox),  the screenwriting teacher his brother has been touting.  McKee savagely mocks Charlie's intention of making a film where nothing much happens, the main characters don't change, and there's no dramatic finale. This sequence clearly defines the problem Jonze and the real Kaufman are facing.  They have presented a problem most interestingly, but there isn't any solution.It's here that things go wrong, because the two segments, adaptation and subjects, are suddenly and violently brought together.  It isn't true; it didn't happen this way in the real world (which in a self conscious and amusing way has been pretty well replicated up till now); and it all seems corny and unconvincing and is rounded out with a trite motto or two. It's hard to see this blustering finale as anything other than another example of the unevenness of tone that characterizes the work of a lot of young American filmmakers, who start out sly and sardonic and wind up corny--an unevenness `Pumpkin,' `The Good Girl,' and `About Schmidt' provide other recent examples of.  Nonetheless Jonze and Kaufman show themselves to be very close to the top of the game here in their ability to make popular art out of real material in a sophisticated and entertaining way.  Like `About Schmidt,' `Adaptation' may succeed in gently leading the general audience in an edgier direction, and this time the result is much more fun."
351,Adaptation.,9,6 January 2003,I don't care about the banter,"I just got back from seeing Adaptation, and I LOVED it. I'm not interested in joining the debate as to whether the movie sucks or not. I just want to know what was true and what wasn't! I know that Charlie is very much a private person, and I think that with a mind as unique as his, he is entitled- but I can't help but wonder about what was real."
352,Adaptation.,,29 December 2002,The Creative Process is Always Messy,"""Adaptation"" takes us through the mind of one Charlie Kaufman as he struggles to write a screenplay for a book that is basically ""unadaptable."" As a commentary of the creative process, the movie is full of brilliant moments especially early in the film when Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) debate whether or not he should have coffee and a muffin before or after he knocks of a few pages of this script.Like its predecessor ""Being John Malkovich"" (which is namechecked several times)  ""Adaption"" is irreverent, unpredictable, clever and engaging but after ninety minutes or so falls of the rails with an unsatisfying ending. I thought that both films were three fourths  brilliant, yet both suffered from excessive length and in the case of ""Adaptation"" ridiculous use of standard screenwriting cliches that left me with an overall feeling of disappointment.When a writers-blocked Kaufman goes to a screenwriting seminar and is told that the only thing that really matters is the ending it's a shame that the real filmmakers didn't heed that advice.Chris Cooper is brilliant as John LaRoche, and his performance is the main reason to see this film.  Cooper (""American Beauty,"" ""Lone Star"") should finally get his due with an Oscar nomination.  Cage is solid in the duals roles of Charlie Kaufman and his ""twin brother.""  Oscar worthy?  Perhaps.
The creative process is always messy and this is a messy film, true to the process that inspired it.  A lot of great scenes, especially in the first sixty minutes, but ultimately disappointing.  Kind of like a marathon runner who runs 26 miles, is in the lead, but quits down the home stretch refusing to break the tape at the finish line."
353,Adaptation.,8,5 January 2003,Wacky/Offbeat,"Think ""Sunset Boulevard"" as written/directed by Hunter Thompson. Nicolas Cage gives his best performance since ""Raising Arizona.""The film jumps around in time and place, careening from Los Angeles to Florida to New York, as screenwriter Charles Kaufman attempts to complete a screenplay based on the book ""The Orchard Thief"" by Susan Orleans. Kaufman can't get a handle on the story. His life and mind are chaotic. Things get worse for him when his twin brother Donald announces that he too wants to be a screenwriter.  Merriment ensues.I highly recommend this film. Anyone who does see it should stay for the ""Easter egg"" at the end of the credits."
354,Adaptation.,,27 December 2002,Aptly Adapted.,"This is a brilliant movie that many people won't like because they don't understand it. Why does it take such a bizarre twist at the end? I believe the final shot of the movie sums it all up: flowers growing on the side of a busy highway, adapting to the busy world around them. Charlie struggles to remain true to Susan Orlean's book, but when he realizes that the subject of flowers (however fascinating Susan makes them seem) isn't enough to sustain a feature length movie, he must adapt it to fit a typical Hollywood blockbuster formula, complete with sex, drugs, violence, and life-changing revelations. Like the flowers, he adapts himself."
355,Adaptation.,5,2 January 2003,So overrated it makes my  head spin,"Ok, this movie is probably better written and more original than the average movie today, but tht isn't saying much.  The amount of lavish praise given this film is so excessive it is simply beyond my understanding. I could name any number of movies that are more compeling (mostly from the past) that have ""great"" screenplays that make this look pretty sophomoric.
Now my subjective comments, which not everyone will share, obviously. This is a dark, unpleasant film with annoying characters that I neither cared about or ""loved to hate."" I cared nothing about the story or anybody that was in it. The viewer will have to make his own judgment on that.
I can understand how some might like this film tho I didn't, but to call ""Adaptation"" a masterpiece of filmakaing is ridiculous."
356,Adaptation.,,26 December 2002,Disappointing from a shallow viewer's perspective,"Nicholas Cage was great in terms of being able to transform himself physically, facially between the two characters he played however overall I was really disappointed. I thought that this was basically another self-indulgent insider Hollywood movie that suffers from one of the faults that I find the most offensive, being very, very slow.  Now I confess that I am a dumb, middle-aged male who goes to the movies to be entertained more than to be challenged however, take this for what its worth.  Again for what it's worth, my favorite movies are the Godfathers I and II, Chinatown, Night Moves, Moonstruck, The Deerhunter, Cabaret and I liked more recent movies like Mostly Martha, My Wife The Actress, About a Boy, Amazing and Lovely."
357,Adaptation.,,1 January 2003,Tedious Start; Explosive Climax,"About halfway through ""Adaptation"" Charlie Kaufman's agent tells him it doesn't matter how bad a screenplay is, as long as it has a big finish.  In many ways, that sums up ""Adaptation"", which plods along though a first half, filled with navel gazing characters who are neither compelling, nor even particularly likable.  Charlie Kaufman (Cage) suffers writers block and spend hours telling himself he's fat and repulsive.  Twin brother Donald has a healthier approach to life, but mostly comes across as a self-absorbed, insensitive boob, constantly interrupting and intruding upon his brother's work and life. Author Susan Orlean (Streep) seems snobbish and fearful. And  John LaRoche, subject of Orlean's novel, is pitiful and creepy at the same time.  Having fun yet?  I certainly wasn't, as I struggled to maintain interest in watching these unappealing characters trudge through their lives.  Earth to Spike -- what were you thinking?One bright spot was an excellent performance by Brian Cox as Robert McKee, the sarcastic, intimidating writing coach.Anyone who survives the endurance test of the first half is rewarded with a jarring twist and an explosive finish as the dull character study unexpectedly changes lanes and becomes an action movie, complete with kidnapping, car crashes, alligator attacks and plenty of gun fighting.  What just happened here?""Adaptation"" turns out to be an excellent movie; I know because great films always intrude on my thoughts for days after I see them.  This one initially bored me, and made me angry, but it also made me feel things I didn't want to feel, in must the same way as ""Punch Drunk Love.""  Like many great books, ""Adaptation"" demands no small investment of effort before it's gifts can be fully appreciated."
358,Adaptation.,,29 December 2002,"Good acting, but script was ""too"" clever for me.","The direction and acting of this film are quirky and good. Brian Cox is off the wall. Nick Cage is very good.The story was clever and worked well in the beginning, but it then became too clever for me personally.Great team of Spike and Kaufman, I hope to see more from them."
359,Adaptation.,,25 December 2002,more of a critique on the industry and the audience than an actual movie,"Adaptation is only okay. On the one hand, it's very funny when you think about how it plays around with the industry and the insincerity of autobiography. Like when***SPOILER*** Charles and Donald hiding from Susan and John, and they share that moment, it's almost sweet except for the facts that 1)Donald isn't real, 2) this is just some bs flight of fancy to fill out the script and 3) it is such a ridiculous scene in a movie that for an hour has been about urbane characters dealing with their own sad lives. And I started giggling, which was made even worse when I realized that everyone in the theatre was silent and totally in the moment.So it's only so-so when you see it, but thinking about its construction and how it works the audience and so on makes for good mental masturbation. Which leads into the bad part, because that's all it really is. Total mental masturbation on Kaufman's part, as he exploits the audience and writes this ridiculous story, hijacking the book. Others have said that it lacks heart, but I'd say that only in the end it does. Most of the movie is spent on how awkward Charlie is and builds him as a character, but the purposely fake cop-out ending is what leaves that feeling of dissatisfaction. But the ending fit with the feeling of the whole movie, so it's not necessarily a fault. In the end, it's more of a critical essay than a story."
360,Adaptation.,,23 December 2002,Confessions of a Creative Man,"Charlie Kaufman's fantastical (yet powerful) screenplay is where the heart and soul of ""Adaptation"" lies.  Later in the story, Brian Cox, playing a big time Hollywood screenplay writer, tells a class of aspiring writers to never, ever use a voice over in their script (b/c this shows that the writer is not creative enough to express a character's emotions any other way). Thankfully, Mr. Kaufman uses voice overs continuously throughout this miraculous piece.  This allows us to understand who these characters are and what they are feeling (although, sometimes we don't understand what is going on inside their heads).""Adaptation"" is the adaptation of Susan Orlean's novel The Orchid Thief. When Kaufman started this crazy idea, he realized that he was making a bold move.  He decides to make this movie about multiple characters.  It is about him.  It is about his ""twin brother"" Donald.  It is about Orlean's need to find something that she is passionate about.  It is about an orchid obsessed man.  And Kaufman, through his script, weaves these characters together using one thing... a simple message.  Kaufman uses the need to be understood, to be loved, to be powerful, to be passionate, the ""need"" for something to bring these otherwise strangers together.
Kaufman, however, makes this an adaptation of Orlean's novel.  He also makes it a lesson.  It is a lesson on life.  His script is everything that he didn't want it to be (as you will hear in the opening scene of Adaptation). ""Adaptation"" is also about writing, about getting the inspiration that you need but also about having enough balls to go out and write about what you think is true and important.  An important lesson for everyone, especially as we live in a society that consists of people that don't always have the guts to do what they think is right."
361,Adaptation.,10,28 December 2002,A Good Lesson in Screenwriting,"One of the lines written in the screenplay by writers Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman in their adaptation of `The Orchid Thief' (by Susan Orlean) was pure and simple:  `put yourself into the story.'And so it was, they did that and from there this tight and skillfully executed drama blooms from that self-referential, convoluted garden of resourceful human experiences and observations`Adaptation' is as close to perfect as a moviegoer could expect, and is probably best viewed as a self-indulgent documentary on getting from the book to a screenplay with `The Orchid Thief' as a source.  There are probably some possible awards, too:  Chris Cooper as John Laroche [Best Actor] and Nicolas Cage(s) as Charlie and Donald Kaufmen [Best Supporting Actor(s)].It is also best viewed without reading reviews before experiencing the film itself since total submersion with a naked mind works just fine.  And, of course, viewing should only be undertaken with a wildly adventurous and alert mind.  However, experiencing `Being John Malkovich' prior would be a plus and a selfish pleasure.And if you like the notion of not always knowing on which side of the celluloid you are seated, I would also recommend the current film `Ararat' by writer/director Atom Egoyan."
362,Adaptation.,,28 December 2002,Natural selection and the movies: Nothing succeeds like excess,"This film is the best satire I've come across on the `creative' process of screenwriting. Screenwriters are traditionally low in the Hollywood pecking order, although a few have attained public acclaim, and the opening scene on the (recreated) Set of `Being John Malkovich', reminds us of this when Charlie Kaufman the (real) writer of that film is ordered out of the way by some third assistant director. `Adapation' is about Kaufman's attempts to adapt a non-fiction work The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean, a NewYorker writer, which concerns the passions aroused by orchids. Despite the central character of John Laroche, the thief of the title, there is little scope for the usual Hollywood storylines and Charlie is too serious a writer to ignore the theme of the book. So he develops a classic case of writer's block. He is not helped by the fact that he has staying with him his twin brother Donald, recent graduate of a Robert McKee screenwriting course, who is bashing out with great facility a terrible piece of trash on a serial killer which has box office written all over it. In the end Charlie, or his imagination, gives in to cliché and we get violence, car crashes, alligators and all the rest of it. Yet some of the themes of the book remain, if you know where to look, and Charlie has retained a vestigial sense of dignity.All this is done with great panache and a good cast. Spike Jonze is dealing with real people being themselves, actors imitating real people, some of whom are doing things they did not do and would never do in real life, and actors being imaginary people. Yet he manages to stitch all these disparate elements together and keep us laughing all they way through, while at the same time feeling some of the long-distance angst of the writer. The finale in the (artificial, Californian) swamp is contrived, of course, but somehow an ending dripping in cliché seems warranted. Charlie fails spectacularly in his mission to say something about the love of flowers and the mystery of orchids but he does deliver a script.Nicholas Cage as both Charlie, the real person, and Donald, invented for the purposed of this film, does a great job. At no time in their scenes `together' do you get them confused. These are identical twins with surprisingly little in common. Cage is usually seen as a cool, resourceful character even if at the end of his tether and it's interesting to see him as uncool and at the end of his tether. Meryl Streep is incapable of an uninteresting performance and she has us believing that the urbane cultivated writer from New York could finish up in the middle of a Florida swamp waving a pistol with homicidal intent at the adapter of her book. (It seems, from an article I read elsewhere that the real Susan Orlean was originally none too happy about this, which is a complete fabrication, but got used to the idea, and at last report was arranging a special screening of the film for 70 of her closest friends. I did say she was from New York.) Tilda Swinton, who usually plays oddballs, gets away with being the studio executive (she would have been good as Susan) and Chris Cooper does a great down home on the swamp number as the self-educated orchid obsessive John Laroche. Jones has served up a great pot-pourri of fact and fiction, real and imaginary characters, apparently with the real people content to let him and Kaufman paint them as very colourful indeed. It all serves to remind us that where the dramatisation of real events are concerned by Hollywood, the first thing out the window is likely to be the truth. Robert McKee (played by Brian Cox), for the cliché-mangling screenwriters of the planet, does argue in the film at one point that drama is all around us and in reality sh*t happens, but of course that's not enough for Hollywood. Now poor Charlie Kaufman's problem is, that having exposed the hollowness of the process, he has now got to go on screenwriting for a living."
363,Adaptation.,4,23 December 2002,Stick with the book,"I saw this movie with no pretense or knowledge of the subject, theme, or otherwise visual aspect of the story.  To my surprise I recognized it as as a movie scripted from this book, ""The Orchid Thief"".  Good book, light reading, but far from movie material.  ""Adaptation"" was an overworked attempt to make a movie from a book.So Meryl Streep follows the path of the actual author of ""TOT"" but somehow in a phantasmical shift of events becomes a murderous staff writer for the New Yorker Magazine giving chase through the swamps of Florida waving a pistol.  Ummm, yeah, typical behavior from a middle-aged, married, upper-crust, New Yorker carrying on an affair with a toothless subject living with his father in Florida.  This was one part of many within the movie where the writers found there wasn't enough material in the book to maintain the interest of the viewers.  And there is plenty of this mindless filler along feeble attempts to draw emotion, pity, fear and thrills.So the writers script messages into Cage's lines queueing the audience into the movie's direction and/or lack of and how it should be remedied, i.e. voice overs, narratives, clues on the script digressing from the book...etc.Bottom line:  Read the book and save your money til it's out on video. And then save your time and rent something else."
364,Adaptation.,5,26 December 2002,"Not that great, rather boring, below average movie","This is one of those movies that critics seem to like because it is different than most movies but I don't think it's that great.  Anyone could do this kind of movie....Basically just make a movie about a screen writer struggling to write a movie and give them several dumb variations of the movie and they come up with a stupid ending to wrap up the movie.  There is nothing worth writing about because most the movie is about nothing.  Don't waste your money on seeing this movie, I don't think it is even worth renting. I kept waiting and waiting for something good or profound to happen in the movie but it never does.  It is a slow, boring, rather uninteresting movie."
365,Adaptation.,,26 December 2002,"Funny, but the climax is just plain ridiculous","I must admit that the film is very funny.  Cage's characterization is remarkable (the opening monologue voiceover and the ""Deconstructionist"" idea both had me laughing heartily). ####SPOILER### The problem with this film is that it spirals into stupidity.  I am sorry but I can't picture Meryl Streep with a shotgun wanting to murder the Cage twins in the middle of a damn swamp.  It goes from a goofy, Lets-spy-on-Susan-Orlean game to a serious bloodthristy manhunt!  Come on, people, that is just plain ridiculous.  As ""gifted"" a screenwriter as Kaufman is, he could have thought of something better instead of shifting the general mood around."
366,Adaptation.,,26 December 2002,"Dazzling, totally engrossing, and exhilarating--worth seeing at least three or four more times","I know that no film ever made will get unanimous raves. Still, I was a little astonished by a few of the negative comments this extraordinary film got. ""Pretentious?"" How can a reviewer possibly have a clue as to what lurks in a filmmaker's thoughts and soul?  A hundred thousand scriptwriters have written something about writer's block? I doubt that a hundred have--and, in any case, none that I'm aware of seem to have done it as well. Barton Fink--a pretty good movie--is the only one with a similar theme, and, with all due respect, it doesn't come anywhere close to this. Charlie (and Donald) Kaufman deserve great credit for having at least given the impression of laying bare a blocked writer's inner turmoil and insecurity. I would expect that any  writer who has ever experienced this kind of fear and frustration will find much of this movie resonating very deep indeed. Certainly, much of the credit goes, not only to the script, but to the remarkable acting. Nicholas Cage has brought off a tour de force, and Meryl Streep, Chris Cooper, and the rest of the cast also do excellent work. Spike Jonze has, amazingly enough, raised the bar of expectations still higher for his next film. I, too wonder what Susan Orleans thinks of the finished product; I do hope she gave it her complete approval; I suspect so. I want to resist the temptation to throw in any spoilers, and will only add in conclusion that it is a motion picture like this that makes me eager to keep going back for more, in hopes that, every now and then, I'll have this kind of utterly satisfying experience. Bravo. Encore. Please keep them coming."
367,Adaptation.,10,23 December 2002,One of the year's best!,"Here I am facing my word processor, and I am stumped! My perplexed mind is forever procrastinating on which fascinating information should I begin with for my review of the most creative film of the year- ""Adaptation"". How can I adapt to my current trauma of writers' block on a film that focuses on that very same subject? Let's face it! I am just a film critic pretender. I write brief reviews instead of lengthy ones so I could standstill the torture to my readers at a certain point.  One of the reasons I am two steps shy of being an alcoholic is because I want a Hemingway spirituality to enlighten my creative juices. How can I stop my self-loathing and write a review on a film that also focuses on that very same subject? ( Look at that, I am such a pathetic writer that I have written two interrogative  sentences already in this review that are very similar in structure.)    ""Adaptation"" was directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman which are the creative cinematic duo that brought us the inventive classic ""Being John Malkovich"". Maybe if I was ""Being Roger Ebert"", I would be able to cure my current state of writers' block. On the other hand, I do not think that would be a good idea because I would have an unfathomable case of indigestion ( sorry Roger). ""Adaptation"" stars Nicolas Cage as twin screenwriters named Charlie & Donald Kaufman. Maybe if I had enough to drink like Cage's character in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", it would help me to be more expressive & creative in my severe case of ""blockitis"".  Anyways, here is the dilemma of this narrative: Charlie Kaufman, our introverted scripture protagonist, has the dubious challenge of adapting a screenplay based on the book ""The Orchid Thief"". Yes! That is it! I am not giving you any ""tulip"" about this: He has to write a screenplay based on a book about flowers. Because of this ""horti"" I mean ""hardy"" assignment, Charlie suffers writers' block. At the same time, Charlie's extroverted twin brother Donald  writes an amateur script that is categorized as a ""Silence of the Lambs"" meets ""Psycho"". Eventually, Charlie decides to insert himself as a character into his screenplay. So now the film focuses on those two interrelated subjects: writers' block and orchid flowers. Hey, do not ask me how but that mixture works better than the chocolate & the peanut butter of a Kit Kat ( However, not as good as the mixture of every type of alcohol in a Long Island Iced tea) . Hey, I have an idea on what to include in the final act of this review. Just like Charlie, I will include myself into this review as Charlie & Donald's younger brother who posseses the neurosis of Charlie and the flirtation of Donald. Yea I know! Too freaky! Nicolas Cage's performance as the Kaufmans is one with the ""write stuff"" which is deserving of an Oscar nomination. Chris Cooper's work as "" orchid thief"" John Laroache should fertilize him in the kingdom of supporting actor crème-of-the-crop of 2002. It was also fascinating to see the legendary Meryl Streep find a wild ""streep streak"" to her acting by playing Susan Orlean, the author of ""The Orchid Thief"". However, the branches that grew ""Adaptation"" to greatness was Director Jonze and Writer Kaufman. We have been blessed with 2 of the best masterminds in cinema today! ""Adaptation"" is a film that should garner many Oscar nominations. If it does not and gets snubbed, than the Academy should rename themselves ""The Oscar Thiefs"". Hey, not a bad idea for a screenplay! ""Adaptation 2"" maybe. To be continued.. ***** Excellent"
368,Adaptation.,9,22 December 2002,Adapt your viewing sensibilities,"There is not much that can be said about ""Adaptation"" that hasn't been said already. The press coverage generated, for an arthouse movie, has been extraordinary.Even so, everyone has their favourites; wonderful, brilliant, dazzling, mind-boggling, unique. Some people would also add; self-indulgent, masturbatory, dull and too-clever-for-it's-own-good.Nevertheless, there is so much going on in this film that any kind of chronological analysis is virtually impossible. Every scene and practically every line is bulging with smart comments, irony, red herrings, clues, subterfuge, mind games and puzzles.The overall effect is heady, although not everyone is going to be a fan of a movie like this. For those who are, multiple viewings will be necessary."
369,Adaptation.,4,21 December 2002,sort of boring,"Adaptation employs a host of gimmicks to keep the viewer awake -- multiple narratives, time interweaving, self-reference, twins played by the same actor. getting lost in a swamp, esoteric drug use, masturbation, an alligator attack,several car crashes, and attempted murder. One gimmick is to predict the gimmicks that will be used. The gimmicks remain effete, primarily because the basics are boring.Like its protagonists, the movie is bright but emotionally backward. The characters are not likeable and of little interest. The situation -- trying to adapt a novel to the screen -- doesn't engage the heart. Nicolas Cage is a fine actor but his hangdog look -- which he wears most of the time in this movie -- has to be one of the most repulsive in film history. Meryl Streep is an even better actor and does her best to develop and bring life to her character, but she is caught in a humorless Woody Allen film"
370,Adaptation.,,21 December 2002,Adapting to Adaptations,"Some truly inventive and hilarious moments, with subtle and ingenious arcs. Will have a tough time winning awards, though, because it lacks the tightness and closure of a great film (I don't mean Hollywood closure, but a ""wholeness"" of artistic effect, despite its cleverness).  Worth it for any fans of not-your-normal-films.  Certainly if you liked or appreciated Being John Malkovich, you have to see it.  Exceptional acting from the entire cast alone covers the ticket price.If you haven't seen it, I suggest stopping right here.
<POTENTIAL SPOILERS ALERT>The final act, in juxtaposition to what came before, brilliantly demonstrates the manipulative power of film.  You are comfortably perceiving and responding emotionally and intellectually to one genre, then slipped smoothly into its virtual opposite within seconds.  Some viewers will adapt; some slowly, some quickly.  Some will be repelled and refuse to change. Yet to enjoy it at all, one must.  Otherwise it is indexed under cheap or dirty tricks.Completely aside from the intellectual viewpoints being expressed ""about"" movie-making by the structure, the variable of genre itself in user response is cleverly shown by comparing one to the other in the same film; because it doesn't mix genres, but switches them entirely while not changing any other element, and does it successfully.You can watch this effect as an observer, while you feel it simultaneously and genuinely, while both tracks echo and reverberate  the theme and the action on screen.  All the layering and harmonics of the script between the characters, stories and audience won't necessarily boil up to consciousness until you've had a chance to talk and/or write about it.  Or else I'm just slow ;>That said, it does fail to achieve greatness.  It won't sit alongside Dr. Strangelove, Pulp Fiction or Oh, Brother Where Art Thou, or BJM either. Maybe the end sequence was too long.  Maybe they wanted slight discomfort to last all the way home, or to make sure we all ""got"" the  point.
Maybe its lectures stretch into the pedantic--today's audience passed those lessons already.  How far can you push witty industry and self flogging deconstructionism until it fails the entertainment test?
In any case, it feels like potential greatness could have arisen from 10 more minutes on the cutting room floor.  Just not yet sure which moments, because in fact none are not worth watching."
371,Adaptation.,9,22 December 2002,Smart Man's Movie (?),"I consider myself a smart person.  I consider myself relatively choosy about the movies I consider great and the movies I consider good, and most of the time my choices bear out over time.  I consider myself to have a good knowledge of movie history and how it applies to new movies.That being said, Adaptation is a good movie, but not a great one. Adaptation is a film that is so entrenched in it's post-modern deconstructionism, that it forgets to construct anything at all.  And maybe that was the point.  The film hooked me in the first act, and I was completely involved, and I can appreciate the irony when the third act loses itself in the swamp (sorry for the pun) of a typical ""Hollywood"" ending.  It simply lost me in the second act which merely lumbers its way from quaint thought to quaint thought, with its voice-overs (again, intended ironically) to tell us what the important insights are.This movie was enjoyable, I smiled, laughed out loud several times, and think it was an excellent display, but it is merely that and nothing more. Perhaps we are beginning to approach an era where deconstrucionism is deconstructed, because mere deconstructionism has become simply a parlor trick for the self-appointed intellectual elitist.  Its time to go on to something more, or, perhaps, less."
372,Adaptation.,10,22 December 2002,takes irony to a completely new level,"Mark my words; In twenty years this film will be regarded as the re-invention of comedy. Charlie Kauffman's amazing screenplay will be a landmark piece of writing and a continuous testament to the idea that originality in writing goes further than any 100 million dollar budget can. If this movie must be labelled a comedy, than it is the best that has been made in years. A work of unparalleled brilliance.     Attempting to describe the plot of this film would be a futile exercise. It changes so frequently that after two viewings, I'm not so sure myself. The point is that this movie is a wonderful depiction of the arduous peril that is writing. It is about the duality of writers, the conflict that exists within them between the formulaic, fairy-tale plot and the completely original piece that is much more challenging. Charlie Kauffman, brilliantly acted by Cage, advocates the latter method, and his twin brother Donald, the former. We know that Donald Kauffman is given credit for the film's screenplay and, I'm quite certain, receives the honor for the movie's uncanny finale, where all original premises are lost, and the film arrives at a resolution ending that Charlie had been preaching against the entire film. This is not a formula ending, however, only because we understand that it evokes philosophical ideas about the nature of writing itself, and a feeling of irony that I will not soon forget."
373,Adaptation.,,19 December 2002,A flawless film featuring virtuoso performances -- perfection!,"I know this one is going to be a lightning rod. I can't imagine everyone agreeing on anything about this film. At one point in the story, a character notes that ""There has not been a new genre of film since Fellini invented the mockumentary."" Of course, that's not quite true. Kaufman and Jonze have given us the ""self-referential supersolipsistic snake-devouring-itself"" genre. Revel!"
374,Adaptation.,,20 December 2002,No such thing as 'Donald Kaufman',"Donald Kaufman is just an extension of Charlie Kaufman's vanity. But Charlie and friends are trying to keep it ""secret"" from the press.He has no twin brother--Donald is just a character and an alter ego. Read about it in Roger Ebert's Chicago Sun-Times article called ""Twin Pleasures.""Mr. Jonze, Mr. Cage and Mr. Kaufman are playing a post-modern little prank on the world. They're trying to get a completely fictional person screenplay awards and nominations.They can, because Writer's Guild rules allow the writer to get credit on a script under ANY NAME THE ORIGINAL WRITER CHOOSES.ADAPTATION is an exercise in pure masturbation, and it's too bad Kaufman and Jonze bore film audiences with their mid-brow observations.Grow up, Charlie Kaufman! You and Mr. Jonze are not smarter than everyone else! All of your observations are vain and obvious; you have no new ideas to contribute!It's time for the movies to go post Post Modernism. It's not clever anymore.Try sincerity for a change!"
375,Adaptation.,9,19 December 2002,"Amazing story, wrapping the viewer in a shroud of mystery until the very end","First off I would like to respond to the current review posted on imdb.com , saying in defense of the movie that this critique is totally biased and wholly insensitive to a cast of people that might actually enjoy Adaptation. For such one-track thinking and flagrant disavowal of the intricacies of the movie, it is a wonder that I ever read such a review.Now onto the movie. Spectacular. Amazing. Wonderful. Inspiring. But not for everyone. The movie proves this time and again through an innovative approach to character development, irony that Kaufman has a twin brother that is successful in all the ways he is not, bewildering scenes of schizophrenia-induced introspection which adds the you-never-know-what-is-next effect, heartfelt one-liners and speeches given by John Laroche (Chris Cooper), and a very audacious and refreshing presentation and camera technique. Personalities are defined here rather well in Charlie/Donald, one portraying an introvert, one portraying an extrovert, and thru the course of the movie the viewer really gets a feel for how life-altering those characteristics really are.When I said this movie is not for everyone, read that as a warning sign for people with short attention-spans or those with the need to see someone die or have sex every quarter of the film or so just to remain ""entertained"". However, for those not so emotionally disinclined to detach from reality and find themselves in the surreal world of Charlie Kaufman, prepare for a very believable yet very, very unique thrill ride. I would also take the stance that this movie actually has soothing power to those in leading lives similar to that which is portrayed by Charlie. The movie really shows well how hesitation can spell disaster if not overcome. This flick also delves into the world of drugs, when an impassive woman Susan Orlean (played excellently by Meryl Streep) meets a man who sweeps her off her feet in ways she never had expected, including an introduction to a drug used by local seminole indians that he works with in his flower ambitions. This drug gives Susan exactly what she lacked and craved her whole life, a sense of pure passion and enthrallment, and thereafter she tosses away the worry and restraint of her life to spend time with John, as the movie finally reveals near the end of the film. I won't ruin more of the story, including the very shocking conclusion that somehow manages to outdo the rest of the movie in terms of capriciousness. To close, I think Adaptation is a groundbreaking film that will captivate many and leave others by the wayside, which side you are on will determine whether you love or hate this movie, but I have a feeling the love side will be more populated."
376,Adaptation.,10,19 December 2002,"awesome. kaufman, you rule!","i saw this movie during the advanced screenings weekend and when i walked out of that cinema, i was amazed at the brilliantly composed script that was transformed into a masterpiece of a movie. definitely a keeper, one for the library. cage, streep, cooper, all give truly amazing performances. i can't say much more, see the movie and you'll know what i mean. it's humour, wit, drama and overall brilliance speaks for itself. dead certain oscar contender for all the major categories. a must-see. perfect marks from me."
377,Adaptation.,,17 December 2002,I Talk About The Ending So Don't Read If You Haven't Seen,"Again, I talk about the ending here so don't read on if you haven't seen the movie yet... The first hour of Adaptation is an incredible masterpiece, an emotional, intelligent, very personal movie that makes the viewer relate to and understand the character of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman in ways that have never been done before.  The genius of it is the feeling that you are watching the act of creation AND the creation itself on screen at the same time.  It feels completely organic and original, as if the whole thing had sprouted up out of his mind and onto the screen in real time.The last half hour, when Kaufman gives us the Hollywood version of the Orchid Thief, completely ruins everything.  Granted that Kaufman is just knocking over the dominos he set up from the start of the film, and that it certainly does not come out of nowhere, but watching the sell-out Hollywood cliche version of what used to be such a beautiful, organic movie is no less painful and dull.  It works only on an intellectual level, as an examination of storytelling and the horrific effects of forced drama.  On an emotional level it is an awful mistake, a selling out to a GRAND IDEA ABOUT ART rather than the actual artistic creation that it had been up to that point."
378,Adaptation.,9,16 December 2002,Like no other,"This movie goes beyond your typical Hollywood film. And thank you Mr. Jonze for that! The title is well chosen, because the director, the writer, the characters and even us have to adjust during the movie. The three main actors are superb (Cage, Streep and Cooper). The only drawback, and it's a small one, is the last segment of the film. I know, I know, it's kind of a spoof of your typical action movie and it's not written by Charlie no more. But still, I just thought it was a bit too long after a great beginning.Out of 100, I give it 87. That's good for ***½ out of ****.Seen in Toronto, at the Varsity Cinemas, on December 7th, 2002."
379,Adaptation.,,13 December 2002,Brilliant. The first honest screenplay ever written.,"I thought this film was groundbreaking and probably a little too smart for the average audience. I'm sure the ending confuses most typical moviegoers, but for those who can relate to Kaufman it's a real treat. Probably the most original screenplay ever written. The performances were also flawless, especially Nick Cage."
380,Adaptation.,10,12 December 2002,films like this shouldn't be reviewed...,"just see it. It's a clever take on scriptwriting, film making, flowers and life. All from the twisted mind of Charlie Kauffman, an interesting screenwriter who is doing what i always dreamed of doing, making a script writer a household name.Charlie i love you if for no other reason than this, weird as you are - you are my hero."
381,Adaptation.,,12 December 2002,didnt it seem odd to anyone...?,"!!!spoiler alert!!!
i havent read all of the posted comments, but i'm wondering if anyone else agrees with me that everything after the hotel room was actually written by DONALD and not charlie.you have to admit... it did all the predictable, campy, hollywood stuff that was in vehement opposition to the rest of the script.  i dont see how there's any other possible conclusion, really, but that kaufman was having a little fun with his audience.think about it... sex. drugs. man-eating crocodiles. meryl streep giving an elegant little oscar clip, over-the-top siren's wail in the middle of a swamp.  a dying brother lilting ""happy together""... all the elements charlie spent the whole film trying to avoid and yet, they perch smiling atop his final draft.  i think a lot of people are missing the best part... this is comic genius in it's highest form if you actually spot it.  and it's HILARIOUS.  if you've seen it once... see it again with the thought in mind that everything after the hotel is the product of donald's imagination (and yes, i know that donald is a fictional character... i'm givng the REAL charles kaufman credit for being clever here).  if you really try to see the film from this angle, it will change your impression of the end from ""the script really pulled the carpet out from under me"" to ""oh my GOD this is comedy!!"""
382,Adaptation.,,12 December 2002,Kaufman and Jonze weave their movie magic again,"After falling in love with the highly original 'Being John Malkovich' I was eagerly awaiting the next film from Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman. With high expectations, I wasn't disappointed. 'Adaptation' is like no other film I've ever seen before - totally unpredictable, smart, funny and riveting, without being wanky or pretentious. The cast is top notch, from Nic Cage's amazing double act to Chris Cooper's star turn as an unlikely heart-throb. But Meryl Streep's portrayal of Susan Orlean was the big standout for me - a brilliant reminder of why she was once considered THE actress of her generation. What really grabbed me about this film though was the way it portrayed feelings of personal insecurity that most of us try to hide but what has become a common side-effect of living in Western society. Can't wait for Spike and Charlie's next one!"
383,Adaptation.,10,15 December 2002,"You are what you love, not what loves you.","Charlie Kaufman is without question one of the most insanely inventive (and/or inventively insane) writers working today.  If you are a writer (or if you've ever known a writer, talked to a writer, SEEN a writer, or even rubbed elbows with someone who's composed a decent sentence), you need to indulge yourself in this dazzling, dizzying and ultimately profound mind-blower of a film. As a writer myself, it aint very often that words fail me, but in this case I would have to say that there ARE no words to actually convey how inspired, subversive, amazing, provocative, ballsy, witty, whacked out and monumentally creative this movie is. AND you get two Nicolas Cages for the price of one. Plus did I mention that Meryl Streep is -=- SPOILER ALERT -=- a drug addict and porn queen? (In the movie, in the movie.)"
384,Adaptation.,,14 December 2002,Sullivan's Travels for Dummies,"A long time ago, a critic reviewing a novel said that when a writer writes about a writer suffering from writer's block, you know everyone is in trouble. This picture fits that definition to a tee. This film is as pretentious a piece of navel gazing as every hit the screen. Good direction and some terrific acting, especially on the part of Chris Cooper, can't make me feel any better about having waisted two hours of my time on this film.Why anyone should have cared for a single one of the characters in this movie, I cannot imagine.  Watching the spoiled, well connected in-crowd feeling sorry for themselves is not my idea of entertainment.This was a virtual love song to the self obsessed ""me generation,"" and a pretty good explanation of why most of the films they make are so quickly forgotten.I'm sure this film will be forgotten soon, too."
385,Adaptation.,8,13 December 2002,An exquisite mess,"You know even as you're watching the exquisite mess that Spike Jonze has made of Charlie Kaufman's adaptation of a Susan Orleans book that there's going to be a lot of gushing over the movie, but not necessarily for the right reasons.It's a strong, interesting work, but it's also uneven, convoluted, unfocussed and shamelessly sentimental.  The script deconstructs itself: we watch the screenwriter Kaufman trying to write the movie that we're watching.  He's so bad at it, so insecure, so full of self-loathing and pretentious notions of what a writer is, that we'd never believe he's going to finish the script except that we're watching the end result of it.  Believing that Charlie Kaufman can write is like trying to believe in God: too many signs point to ""no"", but then, we're here, aren't we?While the concept of the film at first strikes one as impeccably brilliant, the truth is almost all writers have at least dabbled in the arguably self-indulgent trick of showing the work-in-progress being written, and most got the impulse out of the way in undergraduate creative writing class.While the possible banality of the movie's main metaphor doesn't rule out it's achieving greatness on its own terms, one would like to see all the moaning about writing add up to something (about writing...and life). Ultimately, though, Adaptation settles for being clever.  Its gushy ending isn't really earned on the screen, but only by, I think, our collective desire to see poor Charlie Kaufman come out on top, even if we aren't sure what he's come out on top of.Jonze's direction is sparkly.  He made his name directing music videos and he's not afraid to pull out the stops when he feels like it.  The best scenes interweave Kaufman's neurotic voice-over with the contrapuntal vulgarity of Hollywood with a rhythm that turns the film into a fast-paced collage.  Jonze struggles to elicit the normal cadence of conversation from his actors, though, when he settles in to more straightforward dramatic scenes. There's always something a little off about the beat of the dialog, the actors' performances seem to come and go, and the editing can get downright clunky.  The deliberately trashy third act feels like bad television, and not in a good way.Nicholas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman and his twin brother Donald.  It's a lot to ask of the strapping Cage: to play not one, but two chubby, neurotic, nebbishy screenwriters.  He pulls it off, effortlessly.  If it isn't his best performance, it's certainly his most impressive self-transformation. The rest of the cast entertains but has a hard time finding traction, in part because the way the story is hacked up into flashbacks, flash-forwards, and memories calls attention to the unevenness of tone between the different segments of the movie.While Adaptation isn't a masterpiece, at times it is painfully funny (particularly Cage's recurring masturbation scenes).  It's really a must-see movie for anyone who's a writer, and as the movie suggests, who isn't?"
386,Adaptation.,8,12 December 2002,Another Jonze film with integrity and guts (slight spoiler),"Call it an insider's joke, or call it ""smart,"" even if you mean it as an epithet. But don't complain about the last 20 minutes...because hating the last 20 minutes suggests that a) you don't get the Moebius-strip nature of the entire work or b) you do get it, but you're so smugly superior to hack/alter-ego Hollywood screenwriting that you can't tolerate it even when it serves a purpose. A Christmas-season analogy: would you go to hear Handel's Messiah, enjoy almost all of it because you haven't heard it that much before, and then bitch afterwards that the ""Hallelujah Chorus"" part at the end was too familiar? It's too familiar because it's the distilled, often-substituted version of a great work, and ""Donald's"" final 20 minutes of this film is the distilled, plot-addled, shoot-em-up version of Charlie's elegy on the search for pure beauty and survival within the swamp of pop culture. It doesn't negate the earlier humor, pathos and performances, it completes them. This is not a perfect film, but it's exactly the kind of communication I want from directors in Hollywood. It is about ten times more illuminating as an outsider's meditation on insider film-making than ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" and equivalent, possibly better than ""The Player."" I expect it will move Jonze's career forward. Kudos to Carter Burwell for another exceptional score, too."
387,Adaptation.,8,12 December 2002,I Found a World of Laughter & Horror ...,"For the longest time I have wanted to see a movie before anyone else. Many trips to this site, I had noticed people commenting on a movie before it came out.  I was in work yesterday and we were notified by e-mail that they had received tickets for a private screening.  I quickly went to this site to see what type of movie it was and then I submitted my name for the raffle.  I never thought I would win, but I won among 20 others from my work.  I had 2 passes and only hours to find someone to go.  Too short of notice, but I wasn't going to let that stop me.  I went by myself.  Not really something I wish to do often, but this was a private screening.  I had to see it.   Any one who stuck around after that dribble I thank you.  This was an excellent movie that took me a while to get in tuned to.  Even still, it was a very confusing movie at times.  Although, even if it confused you, you still enjoyed what you saw.  This movie would have you laughing out loud one minute and then the next you would be horrified from an image you saw.  This was the type of movie where you have to pay good attention to understand, but for the most part it explains itself by the end of the movie.  It reminds me of a Fight Club or Memento with a different storyline.  I wonder how much of this movie was inspired by real events.  Regardless it was a creative movie that kept you glued, whether laughing or whether stunned in silence.      I recommend anyone to go out and see this if you like non conventional movies.  Hell, even if you don't give this a shot, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  I truly cant wait for the months to go by when this becomes another great release on DVD."
388,Adaptation.,,12 December 2002,See this for Chris Cooper's performance,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD** Describing the plot would just spoil some surprises--let's just say it's a meditation on finding passion and creativity in your life--whether it involves writing or orchid hunting or something else. Nicholas Cage is so good playing twin brothers--Charles, a neurotic, emotionally and professionally blocked screenwriter and Donald, a free-wheeling, slightly goofy and vulgar scriptwriter wannabe--that the person I saw it with briefly thought Cage had a brother who also acted. It was also good to see Meryl Streep play something besides the ""martyred/meddling mother"" and ""inspirational teacher/mentor"" roles that most over-40 actresses get stuck playing. As good as they were, however, I wanted to see this because of the wonderful, underrated Chris Cooper. Even when playing a hygiene-challenged, front-toothless, profane orchid poacher, there's something so charismatic, so magnetic about his portrayal that you immediately understand why other characters are drawn to him. Watch the telephone scene when he explains how he lost his mother and uncle and ask yourself why this man doesn't have an Oscar yet. The vulnerability and humor and gravity he brings to what could have been a quirk-filled, mannered role is just amazing. The movie is billed as a comedy-drama, but frankly, it was all dark comedy until the last 15-20 minutes. The abrupt shift was unsettling and, I felt, unnecessary. It changed my feelings from ""Wow, how funny and clever and true. What will the writer and director do next?!"" to ""Why the devil did they do that?"" (I would have later sought out the video or DVD so I could watch it again and again until the mood took a U-turn). Earlier in the film, Charles Kaufman attends a screenwriting seminar that espouses such rules as ""no voice-overs,"" ""no cheating the audience,"" ""no deus ex machina (spelling?)."" Maybe the director and writer wanted to prove that they could throw the rules out the window. To me, they went too far and made me wish they'd ended the movie 10-20 minutes earlier. Irony's fine--but NOT kicking the slats out from under your audience is better. The plot twist isn't exactly a ""movie-killer"", but for me, it changed the film from one I loved to one I could admire 80% of. Bottom line: See it for the lead performances--especially Chris Cooper's and Spike Jonze's wild, clever visuals. Also be prepared to have a sudden desire to read ""The Orchid Thief."" (I'd love to have been a fly on the wall when the real Susan Orlean and John L. saw their portrayals on screen. They must have a great ability to laugh at themselves)."
389,Adaptation.,4,11 December 2002,Real-life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman compliments fictitious screenwriter Charlie Kaufman on just how smart he is,"If you don't find the self-importance, self-absorption and self-aggrandizement of people like Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld annoying, you may not find the self-importance, self-absorption and self-aggrandizement of Charlie Kaufman annoying. Otherwise, beware the inflated ego. Kaufman evidently has let the critical success of ""Being John Malkovich"" convince him of what he wanted to believe of himself all along, namely that he really is smart enough to deserve an entire feature-length movie dedicated to the exploration and celebration of his creative genius. Naturally there is something of the same self-deprecating nods and winks of the ""Curb your enthusiasm"" and ""Seinfeld"" self-celebration set--after all, Kaufman really isn't creating, only adapting. The real creative mind is supposed to be Susan Orlean, and the real creation, ""The Orchid Thief""--what Kaufman sets out to adapt--just as John Malkovich's mind was supposed to be the mysterious creative realm so awesome and profound as to constitute an entire new and hitherto unexplored dimension of our universe. But there as here the focus never really is with the creative mind at all but with the explorers, as though they were larger than the lives they explored precisely because they were brilliant enough to recognize the genius of the works they decided to appropriate. What's sad is how such perfectly self-respecting creative forces as Cage and Streep would offer up their talents at the shrine Mr. Kaufman has created for himself."
390,Adaptation.,,12 December 2002,"Better than ""Jackass the Sequel"" might have ever been!","I truly enjoyed settling comfortably into my stadium theatre seat, cell phone and contraband Raisinets at the ready, whilst sipping generously from a large plastic cup of Father-In-Law's award-winning Napa Valley wine.  In Adaptation, wunderkind-turned-enfant-terrible director Star Jonez continues to make good on a whiny, relentless, and vague adolescent promise (which he privately articulated to me some time ago) to saturate every possible medium with his predictable but ""innovative"" message that universal psychodrama is somehow inescapable.  Toward that end, Adaptation represents only a modest and self-congratulatory success.  Here, Nicolas Cage, nee Coppola, reprises his role, perfected in Dead Ringers, as a bifurcated snobbish Graceland divorcee who specializes in botched abortions, only his new birthing method occurs only on parchment paper with burnt edges, and even then, only hypothetically.  (As a well- disguised executive producer of Shakespeare in Love once said, ""it's a mystery""!)  Bravo and thank you for this self-obsessed movie, even though it only occasionally reminded me of yours truly."
391,Adaptation.,,12 December 2002,A study of human passions fragmented to fit Darwin's concept of adaptation!,"If a screenwriter is facing a mental block in adopting a book to format his writings, why shouldn't he be opting for an adaptation to speak of his problems. This is exactly what this movie is about. And it is the film that springs up both hilarious charm and pain of being screenwriters. A fabulously smart film with an awesome cast of actors and characters! Everything about this film is chaotic, as if it symbolically speaks of the mental mess in a writer's mind in his attempt to create a praiseworthy script.Movies with twins  especially non-identical ones  are always fun to watch  especially for the opposing and contradicting wit and alarm each brings to the screen. Here, Nicholas Cage plays both Charlie and Donald Kaufman, twins in their thirties.  It's the pathetic, pessimistic, eccentric, and tongue-tied Charlie vs. the happy, optimistic, sweet natured, naive and charismatic Donald. What a brotherly pair! And incredibly a joy to study! It is truly amazing to watch Cage pull off two totally different sets of characters, rooting out their emotionally motivating passions with great pomp and acting talent. Both the twins are credibly portrayed.  In fact, the underlying tone is heavily groomed into the theme of passions  displayed not only by the Kaufman twins, but also by the Orlean, Laroche and McKee characters.  Without doubt, it'd also raise thoughts on how adaptation fits into the Darwinism theories! Every character is perfectly fitted into this movie to give it a solid touch. They'll fill the viewers' hearts with warmth and laughter.Viewers will get to examine 'what it feels like caring for something passionately."" Is it a human necessity to throw in guilty pleasures to fill up the empty void in life? Or does passion come as a result of one's attempt to meet a creative goal?  The acts and mental focus of all these miserable losers, in this movie, wrap and intertwine around Charlie's desire to adapt a screenplay out of Orlean's book, `The Orchid Thief.' Events flip-flap forward and backward nicely across time to associate one character with another. As the characters relate, the viewers are plunged into their emotions.  Chris Cooper's Laroche is a fine example of humorous character study. Whoa, watch out for the fleeting cameo appearances of John Malkovich, Spike Jonze, and Catherine Keener! Oh yes, let us not forget that screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, literary journalist Susan Orlean, and screenwriting guru Robert McKee are not fictitious characters, and that this film is actually adapted by Jonze from the real Charlie's screenplay, based on his Charlie's interest in the real Orlean's book! One gets to hear about the dos and don'ts of screenplay writing. But will Charlie stick to his original plan of writing, or will he follow the advice of his not-so-bright brother? You will have to watch his extraordinarily wild, weird and winsome tale for an answer! Can one wonder how the characters  so incredibly mismatched in traits  could serve as juggling ingredients for a good script?  The chemistry between characters is beyond description. Predictably, Charlie's script will come out well  uncannily unique, even with all the commercialism to meet the box-office drive. Sure, it does cuddle what Hollywood loves best in this film to please today's movie-going crowd. After all, aren't contemporary films expected to shove up scenes of sex, drugs, violence and drugs?  But frankly, will you be as crazy about its ending as I am?  At least, it certainly provides an excellent response to Charlie's opening question at the film's beginning, `""Do I have an original thought in my bald head?"" An award deserving off-beat, original and incredibly creative composition, presented without the fanciful stunts and GCI effects to make it worth seeing more than once!  I love it!"
392,Adaptation.,,10 December 2002,"Dallas, TX","Just in time for Oscar season, director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman bring to the multiplexes one of the most inventive and mind-bending films since, well, their last collaboration, Being John Malkovich. Truly a cinematic gem, the duo has delivered a treat for real movie buffs, particularly those with a penchant for intelligent filmmaking. It seems as though Jonze just has a way with actors that really bring out the best in them. He somehow manages to save Nicolas Cage's career from a dreadful downturn with an amazingly complicated and comical double role as both Kaufman and his (fictitious in real life) twin brother, Donald. ""What?"", you ask, ""So Cage is playing the part of the actual screenwriter and his brother, only Donald is really a fictitious charactereven though he's given a writing credit?"" You got it. I know we don't usually rehash the story lines in the reviews here, but I think it's a little necessary to illustrate what a brilliant, yet complicated piece of work this is. The cast is fantastic. Cage (along with the miracle of modern technology) plays the identical twins often at the same time. The fact that they have such distinctly different personalities that work off of each other (and often no one else) by the same actor says a lot about Cage's ability as an actor. This is definitely the best performance (or performances) of his career. But he's not alone here. Meryl Streep shines with a surprise comedic role that has to be one of the best parts she has played in a quite some time as well. The real surprise here is character actor Chris Cooper (American Beauty), who finally landed the role that should forever put him in a different class of actor. Hopefully he'll be able to shed the ""character"" part from his job description and be seen for what a fine performer he really is. Additionally, Tilda Swinton (The Deep End) and the great Brian Cox (L.I.E.) round out the already-stellar cast.
 The film is truly a fascinating character study, as well as an insight to a rarely seen focus on doubt in the creative process. It's incredibly self-indulgent, but that's part of the point. You see, the story revolves around Charlie's frustration with not being able to adapt New Yorker writer Susan Orlean's nonfiction best-seller The Orchid Thief into a film, which is, in fact, what the real life Kaufman and Jonze were trying to do in the first place. It's a little confusing to try to explain because of the many twists, turns, flashbacks, etc., but somehow it all manages to make sense if you follow it carefully. It's quite ambitious, really, and one has to wonder how much is real and how much is actually fiction. The line here is quite blurred. It leaves many points open to discussion and really makes you think, which is sadly more and more uncommon these days. It might go way over a lot of peoples' heads, but those who ""get it"", will really enjoy it.
 I'd recommend it highly to those who enjoyed Being John Malkovich or those who enjoy ""smart"" films. It's a lot to take in, but it sure is a fun ride. I predict this film will top many critics' lists as one of the best films of the year and scoop up a few Academy Award nominations along the way. Go check it out on the big screenand pay attention!"
393,Adaptation.,10,10 December 2002,a misunderstood gem,"*spoiler ahead*to all those who thought that the last third of the movie was hypocritical have to understand something, charlie kaufman did not write the last third, donald did(i know donald's fictional, but that's what makes the screen play so amazing) Charlie's movie ends in the hotel room with him asking for his brother's help, the ultimate sign of defeat for charlie.  he can not finish the story, as their is no appropriate ending that would do it justice. So...Donald takes over, throwing cliche' after cliche' at the viewer to the point of absurdity.  this ending can only satisfy the same people who would eat up ""The 3"", for the rest of us, there can be no satisfactory ending, and we have to live with that. truly an amazing film."
394,Adaptation.,8,9 December 2002,watch the flick!!!,"I, for one, am baffled by the many complaints regarding the last 20 mins of the film. Remember what the writing teacher said about endings...Then behold the ending.Makes perfect comedic sense to me.Brilliant movie"
395,Adaptation.,9,7 December 2002,"Coulda, Shoulda, Woulda been the best movie of the year....except...","Let me start by saying the movie grabbed me from the very beginning....Rarely does a movie have the audience laughing in the opening credits ( viewer beware- don't be late to the screening.)The story revolves around 4 individuals, Charlie Kaufman, a self- loathing man desperately trying to adapt a seemingly impossible book about an Orchid Thief into a screenplay, his twin brother Donald, who is the epitome of reckless abandon and Hollywood cliche', Susan, the very lonely and sad author of the book, and John the eccentric, subject of the book and ultimately the key representation of the movie. This is a movie about passion, and it is best represented by a statement made by Donald....""It is what you love, not who loves you that matters.""For the most part, I found this film to be a witty and genuine look into the psyche's of it's character's quest for passion and understanding of themselves.The acting was undeniably great. Nicolas Cage, playing the dual role of Charlie and his alter ego twin brother Donald could not have been better. Meryl Streep as Susan, gave a moving performance, where much of her emotions were seen in her eyes, not necessarily her dialogue, and Chris Cooper as John, was as over the top as you can get. All of the performances are Oscar worthy.A brilliant film except......The final 15 or so minutes. I realize it was probably by design, but it didn't work for me. Without giving away the details, let me just say out of nowhere the film strays into a bizarre twist of tone, that ultimately and completely does not make any sense at all. You are left shaking your head as to why, the writer felt it necessary to throw in the left jab, in the final moments of a film that had you emotionally connected to it's characters.......That is until you are left feeling maybe you didn't know the characters after all.My recommendation would be to leave the theatre 15 minutes before the end of the film....that way you will walk out a very satisfied viewer."
396,Adaptation.,8,8 December 2002,"Original, funny and truthful.","This movie took sheer guts to make, it is the type of movie where you sit afterwards for a while and say to yourself, how did they get away with it, it breaks every mould and is even better than ""Being John Malkovich"". Nicolas Cage should get the Oscar nod for this one, a difficult part of playing twins who are very opposite to each other. At times I thought that Donald could have been Charles' alter ego. Did Donald ever exist? I know he does not in real life, but some of us do have a secret twin, our alter ego. The thing is with this movie, you can take the plot lines any which way. Meryl Streep is great, as always, immersed in her character, she makes acting look so effortless, like Jimmy Stewart. Chris Cooper steals every scene he is in, brilliantly written, full of surprises, missing all his front teeth and yet weirdly attractive. I loved Charles' inner dialogue. So true to form for a writer, the constant self analysis running through his brain all the time. This would not be to everyone's taste, it is a riff on the whole script writing/Hollywood demand of tidy endings, but also a riff on itself and diabolically clever.  I felt slightly let down in the second half, preferred it when it was more cerebral, but I think that was the point, perhaps, then again perhaps not. 8 out of 10."
397,Adaptation.,,7 December 2002,"Artistic triumph, technical marvel, many faces of adaptation","Far more than an insider story about a man having ""writer's block"", this is really a quest film, by turns wildly funny, highly strange and immensely beautiful.  It features three masterful performances (Cage, Cooper, Streep) and a script by Charlie Kaufman (and Donald Kaufman?) that reinvents the screenplay form as it satirizes the entertainment industry. Nicolas Cage's amazing dual appearance (a collaboration with astonishing special effects) is one which will dazzle his fans and make believers out of his detractors. Chris Cooper is so good you really forget he's an actor, and Meryl Streep is simply transcendant; gorgeous, earthy, witty, very gutsy. Five stars for direction to Spike Jonze for the many faces of adaptation."
398,Adaptation.,,4 December 2002,For those who hate the last bit of the film,"I just saw this film at a preview screening in Manhattan.   Reading the comment from Edward here, and knowing how some people reacted around me at the screening, I think there will be a LOT of people missing the joke.(Mild spoiler here...no details given.)When the film seems to go off the rails, with the characters doing some unorthodox actions, seemingly not in tune with the traits we've seen up to that point, this is an extremely clever way of showing us how hack Hollywood writing supposedly gives the audience the button pushing moments they crave, even though they're pretty much asinine.   I have to confess, I was a little thrown once the brothers start to spy on Susan Orlean from some unexplained skyscraper.   That should have been the clue.   Once things started getting REALLY nuts, with heightened emotions and surprising twists of the plot, this was, in its fourth wall shattering way, the part where the less talented brother's influence, and Robert McKee's influence, started to poison the film, and the screenplay.What seems like a movie losing its mind, and taking a MAJOR left turn into stupidity, is the whole point.   Once Charlie Kaufman returned to Hollywood, I was expecting a happy resolution with the violinist he secretly loves, and sure enough, there it was!  It's no accident that the song ""Happy Together"" ends the film.   It's the way audiences are SUPPOSED to feel after most Hollywood pap."
399,Adaptation.,7,12 November 2004,Mixed messages and mixed targets in a mixed up world.,"A set of twins (Charlie and Donald) share a profession - screen writing - but have a very different approaches to professional and personal life: One (Donald) writes flashy, but potentially lucrative, trash and is a hit with the ladies. The other (Charlie) struggles to adapt a book about orchids in to a workable and filmable screenplay while in the throws of sexual frustration.One of these film reviews that will break down - more than I really want it to - in to comas, semicolons and brackets. This film turns in on itself, lurches to the left, lurches to the right: and then changes speed, if not outright genres! (And to make things worse this is a movie within a movie or is it a movie about the making and politics of movies!?)There is a lot of spaghetti to unravel and I found, having done so, that not everything was worth unravelling. Like many modern man-in-danger (life/liberty/profession) scripts the screenwriter (the real one) thinks they can disguise the cliché by convolution, striking visual image (this includes a time-lapse rotting fox!) and comic distraction.What we have here is an unlikely story about a toothless orchid hunter (Chris Cooper with his front teeth blacked out), his mismatch girl friend (Meryl Streep, pretty much walking through her upper-crust role) and two versions of Nic Cage (introduced above, but fatter and balder than we have seen him before.) We can tell Charlie and Donald apart purely by attitude and body posture - so credit Oscar-nominated Cage for good acting. They even appear on screen at the same time. Sadly his version of sweating seems to involve slapping his face and then pouring large amounts of water over his head!How the characters come in to collision and conflict I won't tell you - but if I did it would involve a lot more of those comas, brackets and semicolons. To give you an idea of how involved this is Brian Cox is shown giving a lecture about screen writing (which Charlie attends in desperation) and you can use what he says to help understand the commercial needs of the rest of the movie!Some of the creative arts are hard to capture on film. A painter can be seen giving life to his art by way of technique or poise (dancing in front of the canvas even), while a writer looks pretty much the same whether they are good, bad or indifferent. Their magic is the product - not the process itself which is boring to watch, even for a single minute.Part of the screenplay involves writers-block or should I say writers approach. How can anybody write a Hollywood film (I am presuming here) about a man and his quest for a rare plant? Well I guess the answer is just making it in to a Hitchcock ""maguffin"" - the device that pushes a film from one scene to the next and is proved, in the final reel, to be pretty meaningless. Indeed the orchid is the maguffin and the words of lecturer Cox have been listened to and acted on. The film goes for the Hollywood ending that is slightly out of step with what has gone on before. Not a cop-out, but shows a certain lack of inspiration and imagination."
400,Adaptation.,1,30 June 2003,Extreme disappointment,"This movie is unwatchable for the average movie goer.  It is of no interest and of no intellectual value whatsoever.  You will have wasted two hours of your life.  There is a sickening feeling when, during the last five minutes, you realize this is all there is.  Arrange to do anything, anything, for two hours rather than view this ridiculous excuse for a movie.  There, I've met my minimum four required lines, which is really three too many."
401,Adaptation.,4,21 December 2003,Screenwriter as auteur,"Maybe I'm getting old or something but this one got by me. I kept waiting for it to do something, to turn into something, to say something that wasn't banal and obvious, to show us something about human nature that an after-school special wouldn't, but my patience wasn't rewarded.A couple of characteristics kept me watching. The very USE of Meryl Streep as the editor of a real upper-middle-brow magazine. And it has Chris Cooper as a rabid orchid collector somewhat abused by circumstances. And Nicholas Cage who, even when the role sucks, is fascinating to watch because of the chances he's willing to take. There is also the premise stated at the opening: screenwriter suffers from block trying to adapt one of those rambling New Yorker pieces on flower hunting in Florida into a dramatic movie. (The solution, in reality, would have been relatively simple. Do what the powers that be did with other non-fiction books like, ""Sex and the Single Girl,"" ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex,"" and ""The Perfect Storm,"" for example. Throw out everything but the best-selling title and make something up. But Cage, a man of artistic ambition, insists on making a movie ""about flowers."") Then, too, there is the curious mixture of the real and the fictional. Not just the use of The New Yorker but the presentation of Robert McKee (who happens to have been the subject of a New Yorker feature a few months ago). I wish they'd brought in Tina Brown too, maybe in a bikini. But -- as Arbogast tells Norman Bates in ""Psycho"" -- if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic, and this isn't jelling.The film begins with a manic, abrasive voice-over -- Cage reciting from the screenplay he's working on -- while the credits are still slowly appearing. Then it does a sort of temporal legerdemain in which we get a scene of John Malkovitch directing a film, then a scene labeled something like, ""New York, three years earlier,"" then another something like ""Point Moogoo, Florida, one year earlier"" (earlier than what?), then, I forget, yet another, maybe ""The earth, three billion years ago, the Cambrian Age,"" or -- well, I may have gotten confused.This thing is all over the place in time, space, and topic. I thought it was going to be about orchids, but then it segues from orchids (derived from the Greek ""orkhis"" = ""testicle"") to evolutionary change, every organism having adapted optimally to its ecosystem, the way some orchids mimic bees in order to get the bees to try to hump them and thus trick the bees into pollinating the orchids. Adaptation, of course, is also necessary in human beings as they move through life, only we usually call it development or change. And, naturally, adaptation is also what the writer is trying to do by changing a book about a guy who collects orchids into a movie about flowers. I'm sorry. I'm afraid by now you must be confused too.Okay. Cancelling out some of the same terms in the numerator and denominator, what we get is a story about Cage #1, the blocked artistic screenwriter who is a nervous wreck, learning from Cage #2, his trashy commercial-minded twin brother who is also a screenwriter, how to have confidence and express himself. Along the way we get a lesson from Robert McKee, who teaches an expensive no BS weekender on screen writing and written the enchiridion on the topic, which I was unable to define as satirical or adoring, who lays out dramatic ""principles"" rather than lessons. Cage #1 winds up in a bar with McKee explaining that he's trying to adapt a book about flowers. McKee solemnly informs him, ""That's not a movie. You have to have drama."" I was laughing -- but laughing self-consciously, as you might if you began laughing loudly all by yourself in the middle of a religious service. I kept thinking, all THROUGH the movie, that the screenwriter must have been having a ball, drawing all this attention to the fine art of screen writing. As my mind wandered, not far from Stage 1 Sleep, I could easily imagine the screenwriter watching ""All About Eve"" with his finger on the rewind button, playing and replaying the scene in which a character says, ""The audience doesn't know there are writers. They think the actors make the words up as they go along."" Nobody is going to think that after watching ""Adaptation."" Even so, the director is probably responsible for the best few seconds in the film, a dilly of a car crash that comes out of nowhere.Moving right along, McKee tells Cage #1 half-way through that there should be ""no voiceovers"" at all. At this point the spectral voices haunting the screen disappear. McKee also tells Cage #1 in the bar scene that he can make all the mistakes he wants, as long as he wraps the story up with an overwhelming climax that will leave the audience gasping. The movie ends with another good car crash, followed by a chase through the Everglades, one shooting, and one eating by alligators, ending with a pointlessly apothegmatic discussion between Cage #1, the prey, and Streep, who had decided Cage must be killed for no discernible reason. (Maybe that was one of the mistakes that McKee said could be allowed before the overwhelming climax.)I wouldn't watch it again, but you may get more out of it than I did."
402,Adaptation.,2,13 March 2006,What a waste of talent,"THIS film won an Oscar? I didn't know they had a category for most complete waste of acting talent. When I was in college, I had to read ""Six Characters in Search of an Author."" This is more like ""One Author in Search of a Script."" Too bad he doesn't find it. The best part of the movie was the end. Not the ending, just the fact that it was finally over. None of the characters are particularly interesting and the story goes on and on with nothing particularly interesting occurring. This is supposed to be one of those ""artsy"" films. In this case, ""artsy"" means that a six-year old could have created something just as good. I rented this movie because I figured that you couldn't go too far wrong with such a solid cast. I suppose we all make mistakes. At least my mistake wasn't as bad as the people who created this."
403,Adaptation.,10,24 August 2004,Deus ex machina,"I haven't read all 529 comments that have come before mine, but I did read through several pages before deciding to respond to some plot points that are concerning to dissatisfied viewers. **Spoilers ahead**The book, ""Story,"" by Robert McKee is one of (if not the) most popular books that laypeople buy when they decide that they want to be screenwriters. Then they follow McKee's advice as if he received these ""commandments"" directly from God. I am not a screenwriter and have not read McKee's book, so I am not judging the work at all, just stating a fact about the use and popularity of the book. In my interpretation of the film, the juxtaposition of the McKee character shouting to never use voiceovers and Charlie's use of voiceovers is one way for Charlie to say that formulaic screenplays don't necessarily equal successful (or interesting or well-written) screenplays.Additionally, when Charlie is talking to McKee in the bar, McKee tells him that, whatever he does, DO NOT use ""deus ex machina"". This phrase refers to a plot sequence in which a character is placed into a situation that it is completely impossible for him to get himself out of without some kind of improbable, if not totally impossible situation/resolution (examples might include a truly ""divine intervention"" or maybe when faced with a book that the screenwriter feels has no central, gripping plot and is just about flowers, the screenwriter invents a Hollywood blockbuster/action sequence in which his non-existent twin brother is killed in a Florida swamp after being chased by a formerly sophisticated, gun-wielding author).Things that make you go hmmmm......."

I don't want to put anyone down so if you didn't get it < stop right here, rather than read on >If you did get it, then bravo!  What a masterfully written, directed and acted out piece.  Love it, love it, love it.  Like I said earlier, this film is not for everyone, but if you did comprehend it, how humorous and entertaining it was.  The second time around is just as enjoyable while picking up new bits you missed the first time.Meryl - you show us why you're considered the greatest actor of our generation.  Chris - you were so underrated for so long -- well not anymore! Nic - you should have won the Oscar.  And to the other great actors who were: the Ranger, the American Indian dude with Meryl, the Talent Agent, the Waitress, Brian Cox and also Tilda Swinton.  Fantastic performances.Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman -- Fantastic job!  Not everyone is going to get this, but hey, not everyone felt that Stanley Kubrick was a genius either.  Eventually, you'll both be appreciated!Love it and can't say enough great things about it!!   Fantastic!!!"
405,Adaptation.,10,8 July 2003,Finally...,"Finally a different movie. This movie has many meanings, it might be pointless for some people but again I have read reviews of someone who hasn't even seen Fellini's ""8 1/2"" which is one of those films you must have seen to talk about movies in fact I advice those people to watch any Michael Bay movie then they will find what they are looking for. Also this movie is not really for everyone, it's full of irony, metaphors, satire and it even makes fun of the movie industry in a point of view we haven't seen for ages. I guess this is the best movie I have seen this year."
406,Adaptation.,2,23 May 2003,"Cage, Streep and Cooper were amazing, BUT....","they didn't make me care. Everyone in this movie is an utterly loathsome creature. Condescending and virtually bereft of decency or selflessness, I'm surprised the real-life Orlean and Laroche cooperated since they come off as especially vile. Truly disgusting were the negative stereotypes the Seminole Indians are saddled with. So much for the carp about Hollywood being the champion of native peoples.Contrary to what he, no doubt, believes - Charlie Kaufman isn't The Second Coming, but a no-talent hack shamelessly re-inventing the wheel. Someone with real talent knows what he/she can do; more importantly, they know what they CANNOT do. Kaufman could not figure out how to adapt Orlean's book, and if he cared half as much about it as ""Charlie"" swears up and down he does, than he would've admitted defeat and returned his retainer. But, because he is too much of an egotistical jerk to admit his limitations, even to himself, he unleashed this ungodly mess onto an undeserving world. Worse, as Steven Greydanus of Decent Films observed, Kaufman's ""work"" is full of shocking and degrading behavior, yet he shocks not to challenge the audience morally, but their cinematic preconceptions. He has no interest in the nature of the self or in one's choices as a human being. That many have been taken in by his Dog and Pony Show only proves that whomever said that critics and studio heads are a bunch of mindless sheep was being kind!When Orlean first talks to Laroche, she jots on her pad ""delusions of grandeur."" If that isn't the perfect description of both the movie and Charlie Kaufman, then I don't know what is."
407,Adaptation.,1,17 July 2007,this is everything that's wrong with Hollywood,"This is a two hour movie about a screenwriter having trouble writing a screenplay, and if that wasn't masturbatory enough, the screenwriter spends most of the movie masturbating.I understand that writers sometimes have to write things like this, and I'm sure it was cathartic (Kaufman went on to write the wonderful ""Eternal Sunshine"" afterwards), but when this script was finished it should've gone in a drawer, never to be seen again, and I can't imagine what compelled Spike Jonze to actually make a movie out of it.I was expecting the same sort of zany, surreal comedy as ""Eternal Sunshine"" or ""Being John Malkovich"", and was sorely disappointed. There is no comedy. There is no surreality. There isn't even much of a plot. There's just two hours of sulking, and a total waste of a lot of great actors. My wife and I both left the movie feeling nervous, nauseous, and miserable.Avoid at all costs!!"
408,Adaptation.,7,25 August 2003,"A Very Original, Different and Weird American Movie","Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) is a successful, lonely and weird screenwriter, who is hired to write a screenplay of a book written by Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep). She is a journalist, and her book is about orchids and the thief of  orchids John Laroche (Chris Cooper). Donald Kaufman (Nicolas Cage), twin of  Charlie, is temporarily living with his brother. He is very social and has a personality totally different from Charlie and is trying to develop a screenplay of a thriller. Charlie is having difficulties to develop the screenplay, and due to his very strange personality, has difficulties to express the situation to his agent and to the editor. Further, he is alone, loves a girl, but his problem with communication does not allow him to declare his love to her. In order to avoid spoiler, I believe it is not possible to tell more about this strange plot, that mixes drama, thriller and action, reality and fiction. Some parts are really boring, but in other moments, the plot is very unusual and intriguing. The cast is splendorous, but I myself would like to highlight the performance of Nicolas Cage and Chris Cooper. Although the screenplay of this movie is very strange and not indicated to all public, it deserves to be watched at least once.  My vote is seven."
409,Adaptation.,1,4 March 2005,how did this get made?,"i watched this film because being john malkovich was so wonderful and charlie kaufman wrote both. here, i kept waiting for the good part. there wasn't one. while there are many candidates, this is almost the worst film i've seen with ""name"" actors. but then i only made it through 3/4's of the film before giving up. no ending could have redeemed it.the acting was believable, with the exception of nicholas cage. i don't quite understand how so many experienced people felt that he was the best person for that role. but regardless of who else might have been better, the lines he had were so contrived that i would hope he would be embarrassed by the film by now."
410,Adaptation.,1,1 January 2003,Bring on the gators!,"&#65279;Scribe Kaufman dipped his mouse into his deep well of narcissism and dredged up a twin brother. What a treat for all the Malkovicians in the audience - a double dose of self-loathing! That anyone would find the money or time to waste on such obsessive self-absorption is a sad comment on our times.
Although the direction and acting are frequently brilliant, watching such talent twist and turn on the agonizingly slender thread of a plot about a writer who's trying to learn how to ""adapt"" to the remote possibility of a world outside of his own concave mirror is excruciating. However, to his everlasting credit, Kaufman does flesh out his plot with some alligators-ex-machinas to tidy things up. Too bad he didn't bring on the gators earlier, preferably before the cameras started rolling.8 and 1/2 was made by an artist who had already proven at least seven times over that he had something to say about a life other than his own. Sorry, Charlie - you're no Fellini. This over-hyped exercise in Screen Writing 101 (or was this 102?) deserves a gilded styrofoam ""Quentin"" - the Tarantino Award for the triumph of style over substance."
411,Adaptation.,1,26 February 2011,Not just one of the worst movies: the WORST movie ever,"Our attention had been attracted by the extremely high rating on IMDb.com. This later proved to be more than overrating. This movie simply sucks. Totally untalented screenwriter meets a similar director and forces a bunch of well-known actors to perform in their huge vacuum of what only they think to be a movie. Those almost two hours we spent staring at the screen felt like ages. It is euphemism to say that we were challenged to stop watching it every two minutes.Be aware of this and steer clear of it by far, do not commit the same mistake we did and do not waste any time or money with this ....call it what you like."
412,Adaptation.,5,4 August 2010,Writes Itself Into a Corner,"Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman are up to their post modern (or is it post-post modern at this point?) antics again, and the results are as decidedly mixed as their first foray together into the movies, ""Being John Malkovich."" This time around, Kaufman is joined by his twin brother, Donald, who doesn't really exist yet received an Oscar nomination for adapting the film's screenplay -- surely a joke Jonze and company could appreciate. The Kaufmans are played in the movie by Nicolas Cage, and the movie is about the efforts of a frustrated screenwriter to adapt the non-fiction book ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan Orlean into a film. Orlean is played by Meryl Streep, and the character of Orlean enlists the assistance of of a swamp dweller with a minimal amount of teeth, played in an Academy Award-winning performance by Chris Cooper. All of this set up is very clever, and you can practically hear Jonze and Kaufman patting each other on their backs for just how clever they are. Too bad the whole thing falls badly apart and the screenplay writes itself into a corner that it can't get out of. Hmmmmm....the same thing happened in ""Being John Malkovich."" I see a pattern here....Grade: C"
413,Adaptation.,9,14 May 2010,Adaptation.,"Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) is trying to adapt the book The Orchid Thief from Susan Orleans (Meryl Streep) about John La Roche (Chris Cooper) who goes to various places in Miami to find orchids to cultivate, but doesn't want to add much to the actual story. Because of this he's having a hard time adapting the book to movie form. He's also living with his brother Donald (Nicolas Cage) who has decided that he will become a screenwriter and is working on a screenplay about serial killers called ""The Three"".Charlie Kaufman (yes, that's a real person) is a brilliant screenwriter. Having written the little seen Human Nature, the quirky Being John Malkovich, and the critically acclaimed and brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Charlie was trying to come up with something new with his adaptation of Susan Orleans' book The Orchid Thief. He was having a very difficult time with adapting the book the way he wanted, but eventually came up with this idea to meld real life with fiction with a little help from his (fictional) brother, Donald Kaufman (who also earned a co-screen writing credit).Adaptation is a brilliant film, as are most of Kaufman's works, melding together his real world works at adapting The Orchid Thief with the fictional account seamlessly. Throughout the film you get that this is a true story, especially when you review to realize that the character names are names of real people (with very few exceptions, such as Donald Kaufman), and then at the end, once you realize that this is a work of fiction, you can still see the work of Donald Kaufman on the film as if Charlie was channeling the character's ambitions in an effort to figure out how to end the movie. Naturally, in the end, when you find out more about the movie this only works to the story's advantage.Nicolas Cage isn't typically the actor that you'd look to to portray a character like this, or I should say, character's like this. Charlie and Donald are two totally different characters with separate sensibilities, but Nic plays them with amazing affinity for the shortcomings and strengths of the characters. Naturally, Oscar winning actress Meryl Streep throws herself fully into the game as always, and you also have a dose of the amazing Brian Cox, which is always worth noting. Chris Cooper as the eccentric orchid thief John La Roche steals the show though.This is a movie that I have to highly recommend. It's funny and stylish but doesn't lose it's focus on story and character building. The movie does a great job at remaining faithful to the material Charlie was originally trying to adapt by focusing some of the attention and narration on passages of the book, while also remaining entertaining, especially in the relationship between the two brothers. I only wish more screenwriters could be as inventive as Charlie Kaufman.4.5/5"
414,Adaptation.,9,27 August 2005,A real treat,"""Adaptation"" is about, in fact, just that. It's hidden in the sub-plot (about how bees, or orchids, adapt to their environments) but what's a surprise to our characters in hearing the wonders of natural adaptation to certain objects and colours actually becomes a real lesson in the true meaning of the word. Charlie Kaufman (Nicholos Cage, playing a real person) is like a slightly less neurotic version of Woody Allen. His twin Brother, Donald, is like a less smooth version of Steve Mcqueen. Together, both learn a valuable lesson in life; it's full of action. At first, Charlie slates his brothers attempts to write a screenplay about a serial killer, in a brief, yet informative, bit of speech: (""Stuff like that doesn't happen in real life! Life's boring!) whilst, ironically, he's having trouble with his own script, and personal life; brief sequences of graphic (and frankly, unnecessary) scenes of sex prove this. But there's more to this character than at the time it may seem; he's complex, he's agitated, he's self-conscious- at the same time, trying to write this dreaded screenplay. It may sound like a dilemma, but it's done in such a hilarious way it pushes away all sentimentality and feelings of concern. However, the biggest, most rewarding, funniest joke is in fact, the ending; a sequence which involves brutal death, drug use, and adultery-but which is used to such an effect it becomes a treat; life is becoming, in fact, for Charlie, what he swore it never was. Hilarious as it is (the screen writing seminar is superb) if there's one falter in this movie's step it's in a message, very early on, displayed by one of the characters (but done in such a way that it becomes obvious the makers of the film agree): ""Bees need to find that flower. Once they find it, nothing can get in there way to keep it."" This displays an obvious message: once you find someone you truly love, you should pursue them, and make sure you get them, for the rest of your life. But what if your in love with your best friends' wife? Or a stepmother/father? Is it really worth risking the trust of the one's you really love for another?***/ out of **** (3 and a half out of 4)"
415,Adaptation.,9,10 July 2005,"let me say this, about that.","warning. COULD contain spoilers...watched this last night with friends.great flick. Not from the usual Hollywood crap machine. Consequently, it did not do well as the box office. Which of course, to anyone who appreciates intelligent films, doesn't mean a damn thing. In fact that's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it. This film is something you remember and talk about for quite a while. If you have the mental wherewithall. Nic Cage plays two roles; twin brothers and I have never seen such a good job of editing, blocking, composition and effects that made this visual (of an actor playing two roles within one scene) as convincing as I saw last night. Fully taken in to the seeming reality that you are watching two distinct people. Far cry from what we saw with, for example; Keaton in ""Mulitplicity"".Streep and Chris Cooper round out the story which has soooo many layers and twists and turns, you will want to watch the DVD once a month for a year.OK, so the story goes: Kaufman, a screenwriter, sets himself up with the task of turning a fascinating book, name of The Orchid Thief, into something the studios can turn into celluloid. He can't seem to get a working screenplay to the studio to save his life. He then decides to learn more of the author of the book and her subject; renegade, unconventional rare orchid hunter Larouche. (Cooper).He does so and unearths mounds of wild and crazy sh!t in the process. You will either be shaking your head in amazement and going ""wow... god... amazing""..or confused out of your little peabrain and run to the nearest copy of Spiderman. The script for this flick was created by a dude named Kaufman who was asked to turn a book by Sue Orleans, (titled The Orchid Thief) into a script. He had the damnedest time with it and in the process, documented his compounding frustrations and decided to write a screenplay on his adventures. Thus... yes. We are witness to... well, what actually happened, to a large degree. And it's a roller coaster ride. And if you think by that I mean dinosaurs and car crashes rivet you, please simply rent the cartoons of the day that are passing as major motion picture entertainment, and slowly step away from the real films, and no one gets hurt."
416,Adaptation.,10,1 June 2005,The ending.,"Is it possible that the ending was in fact not Charlie Kaufman's writing, but instead Donald's. Throughout the movie it seems as if Charlie hates the typical Hollywood movie and is scorn by the idea that his brother, Donald, writes a typical Hollywood script and people seem to love it. However towards the end of the movie, to get motivation to write the script about Susan Orlean's novel he asks Donald for help. At this point in the movie the transition from a typical Charlie Kaufman script, to a script which can be viewed as more ""Hollywood"" can be seen. Perhaps since Donald is helping Charlie in the movie, in real life Charlie Kaufman goes to his alternative Hollywood ego, Donald, and writes the ending the way Donald would have wanted it to be.Just food for thought."
417,Adaptation.,8,2 May 2005,Truth is not a story,"My first brush with Meta narrative was a novel by John Fowles, The French Lieutenant's Woman, which was adapted into a film starring Meryl Streep. It was also my first pet literary theory; the first time I realised that a work of art exists within a form and is shaped by its form: a novel is not a poem, and the same story told as a play is a different work of art. I know it's not rocket science, but I'm a slow learner.What is most frustrating about any art form is what makes it a form: its accrued conventions and the limits these impose upon its ability to address truths whose structures may not fit into those conventions. Western narrative tradition demands an identifiable progress through a set of patterns and Hollywood cinema has refined and codified these until it is possible to predict the emotional arc of most of its product from a one minute trailer. This is over refinement, and is thus open to challenges from artists prepared to attack its forms: avant garde artists, if you will.Bear with me: I'm getting there.John Fowles put himself into his novel to allow himself the freedom to comment upon his story from outside its framework. In The French Lieutenant's Woman and The Magus, he was, in my view, successful; in the autobiographical Daniel Martin, less so. Charlie Kaufman, I think, is trying something a little bigger. Films, particularly Hollywood films, demand stories, but In Adaptation, he tries to make a film about something that is not a story; the perfection of life, the extraordinary truth of natural selection, and in the process he comes unstuck, and so tells the story of trying to create that film.Briefly, Kaufman (as a character) sets about adapting Susan Orlean's non-fiction account of a horticulturist's passion for natural order. This character, John Laroche, is an obsessive collector and a vivid and engaging didact but Kaufman wants to write the film as a representation of what it is he is passionate about, rather than telling a conventional, character driven Hollywood plot. Kaufman's character spends much of the film fuming at the restrictions of unambitious narrative writing, characterised by the fictional Donald twin and his seminar holding mentor Robert Mckee. However, these two characters eventually guide him towards compromises (ie adaptation) with both his artistic and personal crises; Mckee by reminding him that stories are rooted in human truths and Donald by showing him that love is a condition of the soul, not an unobtainable ideal.Kaufman's anxious characterisation of the unease of a conscientious mind is rooted in a far deeper context in Adaptation than it was in Being John Malkovich. The central philosophical assertion of this film is shown in a few short minutes in the bold graphical expositions of Darwin's great observation: the foundation of the modern rational mind. Chris Cooper's exquisite soliloquy on asexual pollination reinforces the theme but the idea is actually explained in Spike Jonzes'visual montages: this is bold writing, brilliantly visualised. The central personal struggle, the narrative hook, is a grappling with the implications of Darwinism's effect on a culture used to describing the world in morality tales, rather than in close, dispassionate observation. It is a story about adapting to the moral consequences of understanding adaptation. On a great many levels this is a brilliantly made work of art."
418,Adaptation.,9,18 April 2005,Gets better and cleverer with every viewing,"Considering just how much I loved Kaufman/Jonze's original collaboration 'Being John Malkovich' (a film which gets my vote for the best of 1999), I can't believe it's taken me so long to get round to giving this one a spin. And one thing's for sure  anyone planning to tackle 'Adaptation' needs to come along with plenty of patience at hand. Enjoyable as it frequently is (thanks mainly to Cage's surprisingly successful double act and Chris Cooper's charisma) there are moments on the initial viewing when it can also feel trying  when the story feels like it's going nowhere, and that screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is wrestling with writers' block every bit as desperately as his on screen counterpart. There'll also be scenes that seem out of place and confusing (including an early evolution sequence that, while visually impressive, at first seems to be there for no other purpose than being an easy attention-grabber). And, no matter how thickly he layers on the self-depreciation, there'll inevitably be those viewers who'll find self-indulgence inherent in the whole concept of a writer making himself the protagonist of his own script.The GOOD news is that anyone willing to tolerate these issues for the time being is in for one heck of a reward, though it may take more than one viewing for this to really kick in. If you felt that the twist ending leaned dangerously close to 'cop-out' status, just hit the remote and watch it again from the beginning (trust me, it'll be worth every repeated second). With the final outcome now in mind you'll be amazed at just how smoothly everything falls into place. Suddenly, the existence of the showy evolution run-down makes perfect sense, the writers' block moments are fully understandable, and Kaufman's own screen presence as a character (as well as that of his fictional twin brother, Donald) actually comes together to make a pretty shrewd statement about movie conventions in general.The real intelligence of this flick is something which grows more apparent as you come to appreciate just how accurately the characters' own experiences are reflected in the entire nature of 'Adaptation' itself. Looking back, I now see how the fragmented, uneven structure remains truthful to the high volume of false starts and failed attempts that 'Charlie Kaufman' has made and at one point states that he cannot go back on. There's also the obvious contrast between the different screenplays that each Kaufman brother is currently working on  while Charlie struggles to transfer the beautiful but not exactly theatrical events of 'the Orchid Thief' to script form, Donald receives nothing but praise and incentives for his highly dramatic but basically empty thriller. Beyond the context of the film, the real-life Charlie Kaufman starts out with a movie much closer to that which his counterpart is attempting to pen, in which characters struggle but do not succeed, but eventually gives way to the popcorn action guaranteed to entertain us, complete with drug abuse, sex, guns and high-speed car chases. Just as 'Being John Malkovich' skewered the shallowness of human society in the way we revere our celebrities, so too 'Adaptation' provides a backlash at some of the clichés most typically favoured in films. Suddenly, the fact that we rejected his initial attempts at something a little more unique and were rubbing our hands together with glee the second that the Hollywood action got underway almost feels like a weapon being used against us.On top of everything else, it did show me just how easily wowed I personally am by what Donald refers to as an 'image system'  in his screenplay's case, fragmented mirrors to symbolise multiple personality disorders, and, in the case of 'Adaptation' itself, a closing shot of a bed of flowers thriving in the midst of the hectic city. I couldn't think of a better way of defining the whole concept of 'adaptation', or a more perfect reflection of what Charlie has to show for all his troubles by the time the end-credits start rolling. After all, he did partially succeed in his original aim  John Laroche still comes across as an interesting character with some intriguing philosophies, Susan Orlean's fascination with him is nicely captured and convincing, and those orchids are still all displayed throughout in their full aesthetic glory. Just as those flowers remain vivid and beautiful even when surrounded by such an unnatural habitat, the real depth that Charlie wanted to convey still survives amidst all the added plot contrivances.All in all, it's a film that took risks  it's funny, charming and very distinctive, but the structure alone is going to infuriate a lot of potential admirers. Another look, and it turns out they knew what they were doing all along.Grade: A"
419,Adaptation.,9,6 April 2005,best I've seen in quite a while,"This film is outstanding. I'm wondering if it deserves a 10(which I have never given). Moving, sophisticated, profound are just a few of the words that come to mind. How did I miss this when it was first released? Streep is at her top level, which is very high indeed. Likewise Cage. The whole cast is excellent, for that matter. Reality passed through so many prisms! Internal conflicts, bumping up against that reality(or should I say, those realities) make for mind-stretching entertainment. Bravo!This story remind me in some ways of Peter Matthiesen's, _The Snow Leopard_: quests for something rare in the natural world that reflect deep psychological conflicts in the searchers."
420,Adaptation.,10,3 April 2005,A Journey into the unknown,"This film was absolutely outstanding. Not just ""sprawling New Yorker stuff"". I have watch this film again and again. Every time I watch. I find a something new, or a deep hidden meaning. it definitely a film you have to see more than once. Nick Cage's Oscar worthy performance was sensational. The way he managed to plays both Charlie and Donald Kaufman in such contrasting character styles was ground breaking. Chris Cooper's Oscar winning performance is sensational. ""John Laroache is such a fun Character"" Copper makes him a legend. Then you add the The Classy Meryl Streep as Susan Orlean, and you get in my opinion the most watchable film in years. Kaufman, Jones and Adaptation inspired me to Restart Film writing. As soon as I finished watching, I picked up a pen and a pad."
421,Adaptation.,8,26 January 2005,Why not a movie about flowers?,"I enjoyed the film, though I liked the more sincere 'Spotless Mind' better. Truth is, most of real life isn't movie material, unless there's alligators involved (I'm glad Kaufman wrote in alligators).I only bother to comment because I do wish Kaufman would have made the movie about flowers. Darwin's book on orchids, and the extraordinarily specific adaptations these flowers have made to suit insects, is mentioned but not elaborated on. Orchids deserve their own movie, as central characters. How much more experimental can you get? There's some neat structure and a throwaway philosophy here, but in the end the film rides on great believable performances by Cooper, Cage, and Streep, and the light touch of Jonze. It's a fun, honest joke I found myself laughing at."
422,Adaptation.,,13 November 2004,I'm skeptical - SPOILERS,"I don't know why everyone thinks this is such a good movie. I thought it was over cast, and the characters were cliché. The ending was a complete disconnect, going from a dark comedy to some kind of a thriller - leftovers from American Beauty. I thought Meryl Streep was completely inappropriate for this role, and I never could identify with her in the slightest. The attempt at sexual playfulness was inept and I felt whe was generally uncomfortable throughout the film. Camera angles can only cover up so much. Chris Cooper's character was unexciting and uninteresting. I thought the only reason he got any recognition for this role is because he probably deserved the award for American Beauty, but got bushwhacked by Michael Caine. Nicolas Cage portrays his characters too differently. The brothers seemed to have absolutely nothing in common and therefore made identical twins seem impossible. It was like two different movies. Of course, twins can be very different personalities, but not totally different. The key to understanding twins is to realize that there is this quirky sameness despite the differences. Cage doesn't seem to be able to master that nuance of the role, and that nuance is the key to this movie. That is why the film fails, although we can at least get a gleam of what the film would be if Cage had been able to do his part properly. Sorry, it just doesn't work. I can't recommend this film. Perhaps they should have just made the documentary."
423,Adaptation.,7,4 November 2004,"Almost, but not quite","Kaufman constructs a promising framework in this circular tale of the process of adaptation, Hollywood style. The two Kaufman brothers, pitting creative originality on one side and the Hollywood mainstream on the other have some great comic moments, but Kaufman diverts from this promising character study towards the end of the film. At that point the action heats up, and the characters take over the film and drive it towards a surreal conclusion. Unfortunately this is also where the film seems to fly off on a tangent, and seems oddly disjointed from the first act. As such, despite an intriguing beginning and some entertaining moments, the film lacks the overall cohesiveness of Kaufman's earlier ""Being John Malkovich""."
424,Adaptation.,10,13 September 2004,Get Adapted to an Unadaptable Master Piece,"I'm getting use to love all these not very loved movies, such as Being John Malkovich, The Hours and Adaptation among others. And it's great to do it specially when I get to read all the comments of those who hated these movies.Adaptation toke me into an uncomfortable trip through the lives of people that were not supposed to be related. Their destinies were not supposed to end up together at any point,but because of a minor reason, that kind of reasons that actually exist everyday, they did. Their lives cross and get all mixed up and even if the journey it's very accidental, it is a great one. Again we have the director and writer creating something that is already there: Humanity. Of course in an original way, because no one could ever do a movie about how hard that movie was to be done. At least no one that fallows the rules that an expert scriptwriter gives you in a seminary. Adaptation is not only an adaptation wanna be of a book, but an adaptation of people trying to do their jobs, to achieve their goals in life and to get adapted to others. That is what it's most attractive of this movie, that is why a twin brother that doesn't exist in real life is created for charlie and that is why Charlie is the main character. Lets' break the method and show humans getting everything wrong, making tons of mistakes, well that and a great Spike Jonze directing a one of a kind movie. I believe that Nicolas Cage was splendid and did the best job he has ever done. Meryl Streep again showed us why is she one of the best if not the best actress that Hollywood has ever had. And of course Chris Cooper was all the unpleasant man he had to be as John Laroche."
425,Adaptation.,6,19 August 2004,I was a little bit disappointed,"I adore Being John Malkovich. It is a fantastic movie that totally enthralls and entertains me; it's a true masterpiece of bizarre absurdity. I think it works on every level. A perfect 10.So I expected a lot from Adaptation. And while this, too, is an interesting film, it really comes nowhere near BJM. The whole metafiction shtick with the author in the story is a postmodern fad that was never much good to begin with, and certainly doesn't have much originality by now. It's interesting to see the writing process exposed, but instead of something as enormously self-indulgent as this, it should have just been a movie about the writer, sans all the meta stuff. This thing about the writer/critic inside the story, explaining to all and sundry what a good story is and supposedly demonstrating it with the concurrent narrative, hardly ever works. And it doesn't work here, either. The ending is far too dramatic to be halfway believable, although one does see some artistic elements that go partway towards justifying it (e.g. the twin is just an expression of a schizoid tendency in the writer, the death of which helps resolve things). In terms of symbolism, there is some matter and some substance here, but by and large it fails to effectively entertain and engage me.I can only give this a 6 out of 10."
426,Adaptation.,,1 July 2004,admiration and analysis,"Kaufman has written a streamlined screenplay. Nothing is included if it does not have a particular influence on the story and the lives of the characters. In other words, every sentence and idea has been thought through thoroughly, using language and its qualities to their full potential to extract the most power out of the story being portrayed. The film itself makes you want to know the depth of reality of the characters. I ask these questions without researching first: Does Kaufman have a brother? Is his brother now dead? Do Susan Orlean and her book exist, and if so, how does she feel? Was this situation real and Kaufman saw the brilliance of his own sober reality? The film also encompasses a variety of filmic stances and ""Hollywood"" techniques (romance, suspense, drugs, comedy, drama) and by using all of these (as well as voice over, ha ha) the film has escaped from becoming mundane and predictable and thus Kaufman mocks the society that he is subject to.Within the film Kaufman looks at different attempts that he has made in adapting the book. In the process of describing all these ideas he masterfully creates them. I am in absolute awe of a simple orchid. One of the approaches is a voice over of Kaufman's own thoughts.I was amazed at how accurately a sprawling thought process, that can be hard to clearly understand, could be described so accurately.The character development is outstanding and the portrayal of human relationships sharp and poignant. The actors did an excellent job of illustrating this, they all cared about their characters. (I particularly enjoyed Streep's tooth brushing scene) I want to thank Charlie and Donald for such an wonderful film!"
427,Adaptation.,,6 June 2004,worn out premise,"thats 'premise' not 'promise' by the way. with cage and streep on the playlist the film had a lot of 'promise' but totally didn't measure up. ever since the jerry seinfeld 'sitcom about nothing' and the success of the film Being John Malkovich (a very interesting product) we are seeing more and more of the theme-within-a-theme motif. I have a suggestion for the Hollywood types going this direction: it only works ONCE.this film is like some sort of practical joke on the viewer. I cant believe it made the top 250 list on IMDb. I watched the whole thing hoping it got better but with the timer approaching the zero mark it was a 2 hour disappointment; except for some interesting spots the film never grabbed my attention. I am convinced now that certain Hollywood big shots including actors producers and, oh ya, screenwriters after a century of film-making are suffering mass writer's block and our only hope is more independent filmmakers like michael moore, or foreign producers or SOMEWHERE please step forward and bridge the current gap between what is possible and what is currently being proffered.3/10"
428,Adaptation.,,20 May 2004,Oops! Where's the movie?,"Here's the dilemma with ""Adaptation.""  It's either a smart satire of the typical overgrown, pointless Hollywood movie--or it's just another overgrown, pointless Hollywood movie.  I'm coming down on the side of number two.  I think that a lot of viewers are giving this movie way too much credit for coming from the ""Being John Malkovich"" crew, but this film isn't ""Being John Malkovich.""  It's more like a car wreck (two, actually) masquerading as a real movie.  The film is at least a half an hour too long for the joke to hold up, and it's wildly inconsistent about what sort of movie it's trying to be. There are a couple of good performances, but they're in a vacuum so far as script and direction are concerned.  Indeed, it seems like the various characters exist in different movies: ""Deliverance,"" and ""Plenty"" and any number of Woody Allen films, to name a few.  And worst, there's no wink to the audience to let it know that the filmmakers know that they're joking.   Instead there's a random assemblage of hopelessly ""serious"" pieces that make no coherent whole. See it if you're a ""Being John Malkovich"" fan, but expect as little as possible.  Ultimately, the only movie that this film satirizes is itself."
429,Adaptation.,7,15 May 2004,"If not for Donald, this could have been a great film","""Adaptation,"" without doubt, is a film that challenges linear film structure and narrative. It is an adaptation of Susan Orlean's ""The Orchid Thief"" and, concurrently, about the struggle to adapt a non-adaptable book into a film. We literally see Charlie Kaufman attempt to write the film we are watching. The concept alone inspires the mind like most other of Kaufman's screenwriting ventures - something few movies nowadays do. Nonetheless, aside from being a great experiment in narrative, ""Adaptation"" fails to achieve greatness when it exposes its weakness consciously in the second half of the film.The first half of the film has great promise. Charlie Kaufman, played with unusual focus and skill by Nicolas Cage, attempts to adapt Orlean's book, but is clearly having some difficulty. He is a highly neurotic man, a la Woody Allen, and this is not a light comparison for the sole purpose of name-dropping. They share similar neuroses  self-doubt, mental distraction and procrastination, problems with women. Both are writers too, witty in the voice-overs for which both have a tendency. But Kaufman has a growing gut and a growing problem. He has a deadline for his screenplay and he is far from finishing  in fact, he cannot start.`Adaptation,' however, is not solely Kaufman on Kaufman in a depressed, neurotic tone. We also get a glance at the scenes from the book which Kaufman tries to adapt, with Meryl Streep as Orlean and the phenomenal (and deservedly an Oscar-winner) Chris Cooper as her book-subject, John Laroche. Kaufman clearly loves the book and develops an obsession with Orlean  he is enamored with her insights and the beauty of the world she presents. Laroche, too, in some sense is a central character  if Orlean is Kaufman's focus and obsession, Laroche is Orlean's Orlean.Indeed the first half of the film is fraught with deep contemplation  not only on the subject of Orlean's book, namely orchids, but also on obsession, life and adapting and interpreting. However, Kaufman's screenplay also sets up a second direction for the story with the introduction of his twin brother, Donald, who does not exist in real life.Donald, also played by Nicolas Cage with equal skill, is an easy-going, confident man. He is Charlie Kaufman from the universe of opposites. He's successful, verging on insanely stupid, and popular. In fact, he is even on better terms with the cast of `Being John Malkovich,' which features briefly in this film, than Charlie. Consequently, Charlie does not like him, is irritated by him, jealous of him and condescending to him. And, like in many relationships between the silly-but-successful and highly-intelligent-and-down-on-his-luck, Donald ironically respects Charlie very much, which irritates Charlie all the more. While Charlie struggles with `Adaptation,' Donald spits out a money-making thriller that is beyond logic, but not beyond Hollywood potential. Here, the film takes a sharp, confusing and, I believe, unnecessary turn. The obstacles in Charlie's path to completing the adaptation conquer him. And, while it is clear from the opening that Kaufman did not adapt Orlean's book the way he did, say, Barris' `Confessions of Dangerous Mind,' one hopes that he still managed to create an imagination-inspiring, thought-provoking story. In the second half of `Adaptation,' however, Kaufman sells out. In the conflict between artistic integrity, represented by Charlie, and financially-focused crowd-pleasing, embodied by Donald, Donald ends up on top. The selling-out, of course, is intended by Kaufman to suggest that the title of the film is actually a double-entendre. `Adaptation,' is on one level an attempt to bring to screen Orlean's book, but it is also about adapting to a world in which Donald, not Charlie is respected. It is a world of unimaginative and clichéd work done for money.Consequently, the story of Orlean and her relationship with Laroche departs from the book and turns up on its head into a farce, a particularly crude one at that. True enough  it is hard for writers to make it in the Hollywood machine. Nonetheless, the second-half of `Adaptation,' is not a testament to that. It is a testament to Charlie Kaufman's own, personal inability to adapt the book  what assurances do we have that another writer could not have done a better job? Further, there is nothing thought-provoking or insightful about this conclusion. In fact, it borders on dishonesty precisely because Kaufman's former story, `Being John Malkovich,' and his later forays enjoy good critical and financial success  there is space for creativity and innovation after all. Thus, at the end of `Adaptation,' we see Kaufman the writer getting lazy and looking for the easy way out.Still, `Adaptation,' has its moments, dialogues and great performances by Cage, Streep and particularly Cooper. And, even if it fails in the end, it is still an imaginative quasi-escape from the type of drivel that Donald Kaufman generally writes."
430,Adaptation.,6,5 April 2004,Overrated (spoilers),"I fell prey to the good reviews about this movie. The headline also read a 'stunningly original comedy' and I was in the mood to laugh. I don't know if I even grinned while watching this movie. You've got serious & bloody car accidents, death by alligator; a sweaty, spineless main character that masturbates, filled with crushing self-doubts the rest of the time. These segments were about as far from funny as they could be. Tell me where the humor is, unless it is simply that the characters are so pathetic that they're laughable. This is the kind of movie that people that have seen 8 zillion other movies will like, because it is different. Its just not very good."
431,Adaptation.,,8 March 2004,"Boring, Boring, Boring","The voice-over by Cage at the beginning of the movie ran on and on and on and on... right there, I knew I was watching a loser!  Most of the rest of the movie was just as boring, with the action in the last quarter of the movie spicing it up a little.  My wife left the room after the first 10 minutes, just couldn't watch the rest of it.  I wish I had left, too, but I had hopes something would happen and I did believe in giving it a chance. Realistic?  C'mon now.  Charlie Kaufman (Cage), a screen-writer doing a movie script from a book by Susan Orlean (Streep), finds her sexing it up and snorting dope with an orchid thief (Cooper), and she decides that he has to be killed because of it.  Admittedly, the acting by all is first-rate, but the acting is just not enough to hold this thing together.  I sometimes loan my movies to friends but not this one.  Not this one.  I'd give it a 2."
432,Adaptation.,10,3 January 2004,Incredible script,"Wow, what a great movie!  There were four different stories going on at once.  This is one of those movies where the main character is writing the script as its being acted out on screen - and unlike other attempts I've seen at this, this one really works!  I've never been a big Nicolas Cage fan, but he can be quite good with the right part (Leaving Las Vegas was another one of his best).  The rest of the cast was incredible, but it was really the intricate script that makes it work so well.  As an independent film maker myself I know how hard it is to piece something like this together and make it flow so well."
433,Adaptation.,6,11 January 2004,Lost interest around 1 hour 15 minute mark,"Spike Jonze does it again with Adaptation. For those of you who saw Being John Malkovich, you'll know that much of Spike's vision is different and for the most part entertaining. The same goes for Adaptation. Nichols Cage is great. His character truly develops throughout the movie as well as his twin brother, who he also portrays. The story and style of the movie is total Spike. Many members of the audience may have walked out of the cinema during the film's half way point, but that is only natural for Spike Jonze films. For your typical movie goer, you will lose interest once things start to get strange for even a Spike Jonze film. By the opening of the so called ""climax"" much of the common audience is already half way to the parking lot to start their cars up. For the other half of the audience, they will witness a strange ending which will either make you laugh, speechless, or just feeling odd about yourself."
434,Adaptation.,4,23 December 2003,So Nick Cage loves himself,"I had read the book (The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean, which I recommend highly) and was very disappointed in the movie.  Adaptation seemed self-indulgent and lazy to me.  Instead of telling the story of The Orchid Thief, played wonderfully by Chris Cooper, and the tale of the New Yorker writer (played by the always great Meryl Streep) who does an book about him (and who does not become enamored of him in the book - more sloppy screenwriting to find a quick story angle), we get Major Hollywood Angst about the screenwriter who has writer's block.  The movie focuses too much on over-the-top acting by Nicholas Cage, which seems the norm for him these days.  The cutsie-pie cedits given to Charlie and Donald Kaufman (the latter being fictional) are the cherries on this sundae of Hollywood excess.  Adaptation reminded me of another ballyhooed 2002 movie, The Hours.  Both were self-conscious and screamed, ""This is art!""  No sale here.Adaptation: 4/10
(SPOILER: Big surprise - the ending in the movie is not the book's ending. The Orchid Thief is alive and well.)"
435,Adaptation.,4,20 December 2003,Better self-referential films elsewhere,"I love quirky movies, I loved ""Being John Malkovich"". But this movie doesn't cut it.I get the movie.... I think. The story is about a screenwriter who try to adapt the book ""the Orchid Thief"" to screen and wanted to make it a movie where ""nothing happens"", and bored us 2/3 of the way, then turned into a standard Hollywood drama/action flick in the last 1/3.Well, what really happened (or actually, what the the script trying to tell you what happened) is Donald took over the script and none of the last 1/3 was reality-based.The first 2/3 wasn't really real anyways, we knew that. This point is that this movie is really just a game the screenwriter playing with the audience -- how far can I string you along and make you think this is a different movie until I slap a Hollywood-style Act 3 on you?Is it original? Not really. David Fincher's ""The Game"" was much more fun and enjoyable. Just like ""Adaptation"", it's not really about the story, it's about the game between the audience and the director/screenwriter. But ""the Game"" was fun, the ending invoked a deeper emotion than ""Adaptation"". The main character both changed forever at the end, but I really believed it in ""the Game"", the emotional growth of the main character in ""Adaptation"" was totally tacked on.Is this an ingenious piece of self-referential film-making? PUH-LEEEEEEEEEZ. ""Fight Club"" (also a David Fincher movie) made more self-references than ""Adaptation"". ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut"" was the true self-referential masterpiece.All of this has to do with the script. I believe I got the purpose of the script, I just thought it felt more like an academic exercise. I've seen other feature-length movies that did much better job.In terms of direction, Spike Jonze showed incredible potential in ""Being John Malkovich"". All the quirky things in that movie made what it was. Here in ""Adaptation"", I feel he's rather lost (just like the audience are) by the open-endedness of the first 2/3 of the script and wander around with no purpose. Little things (like the scene where Charles masturbate to a talking picture in a book) could've made the movie a lot more satisfying, but there just weren't enough of them.I think the most ironic thing is that, as much as Charles, our protagonist, tried to make a movie that ""nothing happens"", he failed and (supposedly the audience should figure it out) had to turn to Donald for a Hollywood ending In recent reality, we have Spike Jonze's wife, Sofia Coppola, delivering us ""Lost in Translation"" this year, which is ***exactly*** the movie that Charles wanted to write: a movie that NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS. And Sofia succeeded with flying colors. It was probably the best movie of 2003. How many people will care about ""Adaptation"" a year from now?"
436,Adaptation.,,6 November 2003,Disagree with review above,"I would have to disagree with the reviewer saying that the final third of the movie was disappointing.  I found that the final third was pitch perfect and exactly what was required.  Remember that Brian Cox's character said that as long as the ending is good, people will like his movie.  It is at that moment that Adaptation becomes pure formula: Sex, death, drama, tragedy, and resolution.  He took his teacher's words to heart and made a standard film for the final third.  Brilliant!!!"
437,Adaptation.,9,30 September 2003,Great if you're in the mood for something different,"Adaptation, like 99% of all movies, has it's flaws and drawbacks. But I judge a movie relative to the other crap out there and in that sense I thought it was great. It may have come up short in a few areas but Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman tried real hard to come up with something new, different and fresh here, and I admire that. At least they tried. They weren't afraid to take creative risks, and that's more than I can say for the mass market pulp churned out of Hollywood on a weekly basis.Nicholas Cage was wildly entertaining as Charlie and Donald Kaufman and I actually enjoyed his painful, existential meanderings about life and the creative process. Some critics mentioned how this movie presented a ""scathing indictment"" (an overused phrase) of the Hollywood movie industry, but I tend to disagree with that. It's almost as if Spike Jonze and Kaufman are apologizing for Hollywood and it's cliched scripts, plots and stories, not criticizing it. How? Well, Nicholas Cage plays a character trying to do the seemingly impossible, create a story simply about flowers; with no cliches, no guns, car chases, wild character arcs, and other false melodrama. And it drove him to near insanity, to the depths of despair, to create something different people haven't seen before. In other words, it's not easy to create something original, and if Cage portrayed someone who had an easy time of it, than that would been your scathing indictment.
Also, I'm probably one of the few to admit it, but I actually found myself agreeing with the screenwriter ""guru"" Robert McKee while he was giving his speech on stage about how ""nothing happens in the world? are you out of your f**king mind?"" His character did not come off like a cliched moron, he made good points. Another thing I'd like to admit, I liked the last third of the movie, but not simply because it was clever that Donald Kaufman took over the script. Because it was exciting, and it contained all the cliches Charlie and the rest of us annoyed moviegoers are always complaining about. What does that mean, that I'm one of the stupid gullible masses who likes my entertainment spoonfed to me? Probably not. It's not the cliches that suck, it's how they're presented. How good the actors are, and how to present your cliche in an original way. Haha. Because lets face it, all of life is a damn cliche. Adaptation was fantastic, and now officially one of my all time favorite movies. It's a shame this didn't do better at the box office. How criminal."
438,Adaptation.,10,16 September 2003,Brilliant!!!!,"This movie is so good it is not even funny.  Seriously, I really enjoyed this movie.  I remember watching it in the theatre, and after leaving the theatre it give me such a great feeling of hope.  Although I liked Being John Malkovich, I didn't love it.  I guess I didn't really connect with any of the characters, although I did make a small connection with John Cusack's character.  Adaptation was different although, I had a lot of empathy for Charlie Kaufman.(spoiler)  The scene where he asks the waitress on a date, and she just thinks he is a weirdo is very sad.  This movie was so funny, very touching, and just overall great.  Best movie I have seen since American Beauty.  Charlie Kaufman is a brilliant man, and I can't wait for eternal sunshine for the spotless mind."
439,Adaptation.,10,10 September 2003,Charlie Kaufman is an insane genius,"""Adaptation is a profound process...""  Strangely enough, that line pretty much sums up the movie.  As the story goes, Charlie Kaufman, who also happens to be the writer of the film, which is about him writing the film, is a fat, old, bald man who is trying to adapt Susan Orlean's book, ""The Orchid Thief.""  Simply put, Kaufman (As a writer in real life)is a master of creating insane but brilliant scripts.  I love how at the beginning of the film he tells the producers that he doesn't want the film to be a typical, cliched Hollywood film, but at the end of the movie, it turns out to become exactly that type of film.  The first time I saw the movie, I thought it was an alright film, but ""nothing special.""  However, I kept thinking about it and wondering strange things that had to do with the plot of the film, such as, is this a real story, and if only part of it is, then which part; or does the real Kaufman have a brother; or does the book, ""The Orchid Thief"" actually exist?  Something from within me told me to go out and buy the movie.  Since then I have watched it many times.  The story is just hilarious, and after I watched it a second time I realized how funny and brilliant the story really is.  However, I shouldn't give all the credit to Kaufman, Spike Jonze directed the movie very well, and the acting, especially Nicolas Cage, is amazing; in fact, my sister used to hate Nicolas Cage's acting with a passion until she watched this movie.  Any fan of film needs to see this movie."
440,Adaptation.,10,2 August 2003,No play on the word 'Adaptation' here...,"**SPOILERS**I'm sick of reviews that play on the word 'Adaptation' in order to describe the movie, I also hate it when reviewers write about themselves writing a review. It's not witty, not funny and not original. You know what else I hate? People that complain about this sort of thing... they have no life...Anyway, this movie is about a screenwriter (Charlie played by Nicolas Cage) who is trying to adapt a book into a movie, Charlie is sick of all things Hollywood and just wants to make a movie about flowers, nothing else... then there is Donald (also played by Nicolas Cage), inspired by his brother's success, he also becomes a screenwriter. He attends a screenwriting course and writes a thriller called 'The 3' which is standard hollywood.
Donald isn't real, he is a mere figment of Charlie's mind. A rather odd mind as you are given insight into it far too often...Then there is a bunch of other stuff to think about. There is some other characters in this movie, played brilliantly by Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper. Streep is writing a book (the same book the Cage is trying to adapt) about Cooper.I loved this movie, the 3 main actors were brilliant and the whole setup was hugley creative. The story is a bit messy at times, but nevertheless I give it 8/10."
441,Adaptation.,2,29 July 2003,what a waste of time,"I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It was a real struggle to stay awake. The plot was laughable, the characters pathetic, the lines so lame. lucky I rented it cheaply and did pay good money to see it in a cinema."
442,Adaptation.,9,24 July 2003,Original and Very Entertaining,"Adaptation segues from Jonez and Kaufman's predecessor film, Making John Malkovich. But not from the story, but from the actual making of the film. Adaptation is a fictionalized account of the real-life Malkovich screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman. Kaufman takes actual events; his life, specifically his task of developing a screenplay from the book, The Orchid Thief, and then stirs in an ample supply of fiction: a twin brother for himself, and additional escapades of the Orchid Thief's author and the real-life subject of the book. The screenplay is very, very clever (like Being John Malkovich), and provides a vehicle for some great acting by Nicholas Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper, who certainly deserved his Oscar. I wouldn't have been disappointed if Nicholas or Meryl had also won theirs. I bet the voting was very close."
443,Adaptation.,6,15 June 2003,This adaptation could've used a rewrite,"I definitely enjoyed elements of the film, and it does have a strong second act, but as a whole it just didn't gel.  I was mostly fascinated by Nicolas Cage's performance and the journey of his character.  I didn't care much for the story between Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper.  I think the film would've been more solid if it focused on Charlie Kaufman (Cage's character).  I'm an aspiring screenwriter, so I was able to connect with Kaufman.  But there's one pivotal difference:  I do it as a hobby.  Kaufman actually has a deadline to follow!  I can't imagine how stressed out I'd be if I had to finish a screenplay on a certain date, especially with my low confidence as a writer.  And low confidence is Charlie's problem.  Like me, he wants to write a screenplay that breaks away from the usual Hollywood formula, but at the same time he wants to make it interesting.  And it's hard, though not impossible, to make an interesting film without resorting to standard means of conflict like sex and violence.  Charlie's head is about to explode, and mine would too if I were in his situation.  His personality is also identical to mine.  I often refer to myself as a young Woody Allen, since I consider myself to be quite neurotic.  Aside from being neurotic, Charlie possesses a low self-esteem due to his baldness, moderately old age and obesity.  My low self-esteem is just due to my obesity, as I'm also about 30 pounds overweight and that contributes to lack of confidence in approaching women.  I always appreciate movies that feature nebbish characters, because they're either people I identify with or people that make me feel a lot less pathetic (i.e.:  Philip Seymour Hoffman's character in ""Happiness"").  I don't have a twin brother, or any siblings period, but in a way Donald Kaufman symbolizes my best friend who's more free-spirited, less neurotic and has much better luck with the ladies.  I envy my best friend in the same way Charlie envies his brother, though he shows nothing but contempt for him.Cage's Oscar nomination was very well-deserved, as it was an extremely challenging role.  This movie tests and proves his abilities as a character actor.  He has the challenge of playing two different characters with distinctly different personalities.  Though their looks are identical, their personalities are anything but.  At times I forgot that it was Cage playing both roles, and that actual twins were casted into the film.  Cage is one of my favorite actors, but he has certain mannerisms that tend to come through in most of his performances.  None of these mannerisms come through in his performance!  He really goes the whole nine yards in disappearing into the characters of the Kaufman brothers.Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper are fine actors as well, but I didn't feel their roles required anything especially challenging.  That's no insult to the actors, of course.  I still feel Cooper was snubbed for his brilliant, multi-dimensional performance in ""American Beauty.  Another actor in the cast I was hugely impressed with was Brian Cox.  Though he appears in only two scenes, he makes those scenes memorable and I loved his character as well.I could've done without the flower references.  The first act is a little slow, and it took time for me to get sucked into the film.  By the third act, the film has turned into an action-thriller, so that didn't make much sense.  I understand the meaning of the third act, since Cox makes a lecture earlier in the film about life being full of exciting elements, but it still felt out of place.Don't completely buy into the hype.  The film certainly isn't awful, but it's not worth rushing to your local Blockbuster.My score:  6 (out of 10)"
444,Adaptation.,,15 June 2003,If this is the future of cinema...,"...then bring it on, and quickly!Adaptation is simply a brilliant film! Spike Jonze is a gifted directed whether it's a music video or a feature film (Being John Malkovich) and Kaufman is a fantastic script writer!Cage's performance is memorable! And my opinion of Streep has gone up so high just by accepting to do this film!I'm not going to tell you the story and history of Adaptation because I went in to this film not having a clue what it was about and I think it was the best way really! Because it's gone down in my opinion as easily one of the best films of the 00's (Donnie Darko, LotR, The Two Towers)Chris Cooper must be congratulated for the oscar but I do think Daniel Day Lewis deserved it more!Adaptation9/10"
445,Adaptation.,,9 June 2003,"Not bad, but dull","""Adaption"" is not a bad film; it really focuses on Nicolas Cage's character when he is trying to adapt a book writen by Susan (Mery Streep). The story shows us the struggle a man has to go through to achieve his goal; however there are some unsatisfactory performances. One of them is that of Nicolas Cage. He's too obvious for the part. He doesn't really do anything original enough to make us care about him. Most of his fantasies are farfetched and Nicolas Cage isn't quite interesting enough to pull it off. He overacts most of the time. He needed to be more confident with his character and not to make a mess with it. The scene where he's sweating to write the story is overdone: he tries too hard and ruins the scene.Chris Cooper is good, though he's too exaggerated in his appearance, but then he shows his great acting skills; however, his performance in American Beauty was much more challenging and interesting.  Meryl Streep is not a disappointment as she was in ""The Hours"". She is perfect for the role. She really understands her character and shows maturity in her handling of it. She was the only one who really made me care about the whole movie. The movie has some merit. The story is interesting, since it shows the way some screenplays begin to be written. However there are some dull and unnecesary moments like the main character talking to his imaginary twin, which becomes really farfetched.  The movie isn't one I'd recommend; however, if you want to see some good acting by Streep, Cooper and a cameo by John Malcovich you must see it. Otherwise, don't watch it because it drags on without really saying anything and some of the scenes are very farfetched. This is not worse than ""Being John Malcovich"", but it isn't much better either. 6/10"
446,Adaptation.,,30 May 2003,Eh,"I wouldn't call it brilliant, and I wouldn't call it craptastic.  I liked parts, but the ending was really weird and changed the tone of the whole movie.  Anyway, I'm not sorry I rented it, but quite frankly I don't get what all the fuss is about."
447,Adaptation.,6,2 June 2003,Overrated,"Interesting and disappointing - entirely overrated.  A lot of nothing about nothing - please don't tell me that was the point.  Not in the same league with Malkovich.  I was waiting for the payoff for Act 3 and none came. You're not missing anything if skip you skip this - sorry, Nick Cage not withstanding."
448,Adaptation.,3,22 May 2003,I did not like this movie.,"I did not like this movie (not a film, in this case) because it failed to be anything more than a large serving of self-absorption from the writer, with some small portions of interesting material about orchids and an orchid thief.  The movie purported to have something to do with ""The Orchid Thief,"" and it did. There just wasn't enough of that.  Here's an idea for the screenwriter:  Do a new screenplay and actually tell the story of John LaRoche.  Maybe Chris Cooper would like to give it another go..."
449,Adaptation.,,3 May 2003,Too serious for it's own good,"All i  can say about this movie, is that i was.... certainly depressing, a lot more that I bargained for.  I haven't seen such unappealing character as Charlie in years. There was nothing about him that would hold my interest. Spoilers bellow.*** SPOILERS***I do get that the movie tried to be ironic. The more I think about the more I get a feeling that it's a grate tongue in cheek comedy material. In theory. Kaufman, unable to write an adaptation of Susan Orleans bestseller book, writes himself into a script. And not once, but twice. As he vows he would not make a movie in a Hollywood manner with sex drugs, and car chaces at the beginning he ends up doing just that. But he creates his twin Donald in the process, his complete opposite, charming, witty, but author of most comercial scripts, just so he can later blame the cheesy finale on his ""brother"". He puts in lines like ""split personalities are so overused"" into his chats with ""Donald"". And of course the movie we're watching is made from that very scriptThere are few problems with this movie. The setting is too dark, and at times annoying, painfully realistic. The guy has no life. No friends. No girlfriend. No guts to talk to the authoress. He's getting bold, and he sweats a lot. But his no Disnefied Hunchback of Notre Dame. Nicolas Cage fails to create a character in any way admirable or even likeable. If it wasn't for his ""dual"" part I doubt very much he'd be even considered for Oscars. Or he might have been on basis of reputation and career choices only. NevermindThe tone for this movie is all wrong. Combined  with all too-realistic characterizations, added scenes, montages etc it seems like a boring patchwork. This could have work as a comedy. If the ending would be more over the top, like Polish comedy it was compared to- ""Dzien swira"" but it lacks the humor and wit. The movie makes fun of itself only, like it defies the ""ground rules"" of writing a script. He makes a movie with no conflict, action throughout it's 2/3 although hears it cannot work, his said to avoid character voice overs and he opens and ands the script with them, his told to respect the viewers, and he delivers mediocre plot and resolution.Final problem with the movie is the fact that he failed to actually produce an Adaptation. This would be a nice academic discussion if we weren't talking about an actual book, and living author.He vows not to make plot up to make a Hollywood type movie. He wants to make a film about flowers. He backs this up with a review saying there is not enough character in the book to go around. So what does he do? He makes the movie almost all about himself. His block, s pathetic life. He masturbates fantasizing about the authoress. What does he have to do with anything. Not only that - he turns her into a druglord, slut, and a drug addict for the finale. I would have sued.Maybe he didn't understand the book. It was not about flowers. It was about fascination. His with gardening and wildlife. Hers with his. It would be an excellent movie even if there was no love connection. Character driven, background research. I don't care about mr. Kaufman."
450,Adaptation.,3,10 April 2003,Confused mishmash,This film just didn't seem to know where to go - it was confused and confusing - we saw it with friends who were equally bemused - the main character was irritating - peripheral characters seemed superflous eg the agent - altogether very disappointing and a waste of Meryl Streep.
451,Adaptation.,,7 April 2003,Cure for Insomnia!,"If you find yourself asking, ""Why was this movie made again?"" or ""What time is it NOW???"" you're no doubt sitting through Adaptation. I'm a big fan of Nick Cage, but let's face it folks, he makes some bad decisions just like every actor at some point does. This was not a good one. His performance was stellar as usual, but the story line and scriptwriting (which has to be some twisted joke, as the entire movie is based around the life of a script-writer) is just frankly pathetic.Don't waste your time."
452,Adaptation.,,31 March 2003,don't believe the hype...,"what am i doing, i'm putting myself in my script?! asks the main character at one point in the movie. the point of course being that the main character is the guy who wrote the script, thus putting himself in his move even though in the movie he says etc etc etc you get the picture. is this funny? is this clever? unfortunately not, it's just pointless. in fact the whole movie is utterly meaningless although some would have you believe it's a revolutionary, creative and completely new way of filmmaking. well folks, it is not. bad and boring movies have been made before albeit mostly by worse directors and with a worse cast. breaking rules can in very few instances be effective and creative but mostly just renders the film unwatchable. don't believe the hype, this movie is a piece of s*** and those who say the contrary probably just do so to cover up the fact that they didn't get it either or more likely slept right through it...so, don't believe the hype, friends, go se a real clever movie by a real talent with a real story, like ""the hours"" for instance..."
453,Adaptation.,2,31 March 2003,Dreck!  Feh!  Phooey!  Bleah!,"Warning:  spoilers below.This movie could have been the foundation of the next Player, The (1992) but, after the first 40 minutes, becomes a classic of how moviemaking goes badly wrong.  Nick Cage as twin brothers Charlie and Donald doubles neither his screen time nor his presence, which will give you an idea how undeveloped this movie is.  Meryl Streep plays a journalist who changes the movie's plot for the worse - not that it was getting any better.  Only Chris Cooper as a red-neck orchid-rustler comes across as a fully believable character but he, too, is sinfully wasted in this.  Even screenwriting guru Robert McKee's appearance as himself in this embarrassment to his profession may nosedive his book sales."
454,Adaptation.,9,26 March 2003,"very original, funny, realistic, and moving","I accidently came across a short description of this movie, which sounded interesting, so I decided to check it out. There were only a couple of people in the theater. Not that strange, because this film hasn't had a large deal of attention in my country. On the contrary. But perhaps for the better, because perhaps that's why the content was so surprising. This really is a nice little gem, with an excellent performance by Nicolas Cage. This is exactly the kind of role I want to see him play (not, for instance, the character he played in the atrocious ""Kiss of Death""). The sort of anti-hero. The other performances were also good. In particular, the Laroche character was very funny. I don't really fancy Meryl Streep. She always has the same expression on her face, and I cannot possibly relate or get emotionally attached to anything she says or does, unfortunately. She's a minor weak element in an otherwise great movie. Check it out, if you can.Rating from the Dutch judge: 8 (out of 10)."
455,Adaptation.,5,24 March 2003,What´s the big deal?,"I went to see this movie with great expectations, having read all of the fabulous reviews.  And I left disappointed. It wasn´t a bad movie as such, it just wasn´t very interesting.  Cage plays his parts well (as well as the other actors do) but it really can´t save a plot about two guys you can´t really care about.  The plot moves harmlessly along until someone realizes that in order not to lose people completely, guns need to be brought into the picture! Like I said, it´s not a bad movie, but it´s not good either.  It will appeal mostly to wannabe playwriters.  Much like Lost Highway, it dares the audience to find hidden meanings although it doesn´t contain any. 5/10"
456,Adaptation.,,8 March 2003,Flores por los muertos!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Cage's terrible ""one expression"" acting is unbearable in this film since he plays two parts! Despite the script writer's and the director's efforts to blend together a number of story lines, the only one that engaged me emotionally was that of Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) and John Laroche (Chris Cooper). Eliminating practically all story-scene material involving Nicolas Cage playing Charlie and Donald would have resulted in a very interesting film worthy of Meryl Streep's great talents. The last 20 minutes of the film are ""scenes from another movie""! I find it absolutely amazing that this film has received such good reviews. My qualifications in passing judgment on this film are as follows: I have been a member of The Writers Guild of America for over 35 years, I hold the BA, MA, and Ph.D. degrees from the film-tv departments of UCLA and USC, and I have been a university professor for 34 years teaching film."
457,Adaptation.,7,9 March 2003,Let's Make Up a Screenplay for this Movie as we Go Along,"From the Being John Malkovitch' stable comes a movie that is far too clever by half but, like its predecessor, is entertaining enough to be forgiven. Nick Cage plays both a serious scriptwriter and his wannabe brother who wants to write movies by numbers and get the chicky-babe perks. The film, we gradually realise, is the developing script as written by the serious brother and messed up and then saved by the second brother. Making a film from a novel about the beauty of orchids is the rather limp excuse for which no-one can manage to find a satisfying storyline. The resulting adaptation' is something of a failure in a literal sense, but a triumph of creative ingenuity and self-parody. Cleverness triumphs over substance  but what the heck."
458,Adaptation.,4,5 March 2003,Far too clever!,"After the superb Being John Malkovich, I entered the cinema with great expectation for this movie. The critics have been raving all week, the Oscar nominations, BAFTA wins and Golden Globe nods all seem to be telling me the same thing. I must see this movie!But unlike Being John Malkovich, which I think is one of the most intelligent, witty, and original movies in many a year, I left the cinema very disappointed. But I don't understand why.The performances from this movie are excellent. Nicolas Cage proves that he's more than a Hollywood superstar once again; Meryl Streep proves that she is still one of the best screen actresses around; and Chris Cooper proves what an underrated actor he really is. The basic idea of how the script writer, having trouble adapting a novel, ends up writing about the troubles of adapting a novel is, like Malkovich, very clever. But maybe that's the problem. Maybe it was just too clever.I found it quite slow (looked at watch twice during the movie), I laughed once and I felt that Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze had led us all down the garden path. The opening with the on-set shots of Being John Malkovich promised us that we were going to enter the same world as before, but by the end I found that it a struggle. All hail for trying to bring intelligence back to the movies, but maybe next time guys...don't try too hard!"
459,Adaptation.,,3 March 2003,"I get it, but still disappointed","SPOILER ALERTI won't go into performances, direction, etc., but wanted to comment on the ending, which I did get. It's Donald's ending, which is a great idea, but...I think I was disappointed Charlie didn't finish it but copped out for a ""Donald"" ending, because obviously Donald isn't a great screenwriter so couldn't write a classy ending, whereas if Charlie had written a ""Hollywood"" ending just to finish it, it would've been a better ending and still been a great satire of Hollywood. He would've written a commercially satisfying ending instead of a sloppy one. Of course, that would negate the need for Donald to exist in the first place, which would've made the rest of the movie poorer.What's sad is we go with Charlie for 2 acts then he abandons us and serves up something third rate and blames it all on non-existant Donald.Roll on, ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" the funniest book I ever read. I hope his adaptation didn't cause him sleepless nights."
460,Adaptation.,10,13 January 2003,The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen,"Yes, thats it, this is the best movie i have seen, why?It has the most intelligent script Hollywood have seen in years, it has a terrific cast, wonderful direction and one of life´s lessons. If Nicolas Cage id dont even nominated for Best Actor in  the Oscars this will be an ""awars thief"" oscar season, and if Chris Cooper doesnt win Best Supporting Actor it will be one of the years biggest dissapointments. Adaptation is engaging, comical sometimes, but after all its ""real"" its one of a hell of story structurated as you have never seen before."
461,Adaptation.,10,5 September 2005,"If This Movie Were Any Better, God Himself Would Weep","If anyone says that Nicolas Cage can't act, more often than not they're right. But this is one exception. Cage is not only convincing as one character, but two - so convincing that I found myself forgetting it was Cage and even forgetting the two characters shared one actor. Beyond that, the film is brilliant. It is a voyeuristic glance into the life of a voyeuristic yet solipsistic screenwriter. Based on a true story, it becomes hard to separate the fact from the fiction and ends up becoming something larger than life. There is nothing bad that can possibly be said about this movie. Chris Cooper also shines as the lovable, yet deplorable, John Laroche. Never before has a movie of this magnitude been filmed and never again are we likely to see anything close. My body is still tingling from the excitement felt from my head, through my lower intestine, and straight on to my toe-tips. Highest possible recommendation!"
462,Adaptation.,6,21 May 2003,Crapdaptation.,"For a story about twin screenwriters, ""Adaptation"" conjures up an conglomerated mess of a screenplay which leaps around  through time delivering a meager story full of huge hunks of inconsequential time wasting filler (eg: the whole Brian Cox thing). On the up side, the film made critics salivate and scored big with the public at large with Streep front and center and two Cages for the price of one. On the downside, the film created comic characters and then presumptuously worked them in dramatic situations as though we're supposed to make the buy-in and care what happens to  them. ""Adaptation"" is unconventional instead of creative, over-wrought instead of inspired, and wastes the talents of Streep with a shallow character and no stretching. In spite of all the sham, the film has enough Hollywood star power and tawdry tinselization to make it easy to recommend albeit with considerable reservation. (C+)"
463,Adaptation.,4,28 February 2013,For Pretentious  Screenwriters Only,"I had a conversation with a professional film critic who told me "" there's two types of film - films that take you out of yourself and films that take you into yourself "" . We can all instantly think of a movie that takes us out of ourselves , a film that engages and compels , of heat and noise and of the good guy dispatching a bad guy , saving the girl/the town/the universe , a film that usually has Made In Hollywood emblazoned on its braggart chest . Films that take you in to yourself are slightly more difficult to discern . Certainly a few European film makers might fall under this type of introverted introspective cinema such as Andrei Tarkovsky or Wim Wenders. ADAPTATION directed by Spike Jonze and adapted by Charlie Kaufman from a science book by Susan Orlean is a rare example of a Hollywood film taking the audience in to itself . One can quickly see why Hollywood makes its money by producing films featuring hot babes , explosions and dead bad guys A lot of people have criticised the ending as ruining the film . May I suggest the beginning and middle should be equally blamed for ruining the movie ? The film starts with a would be screenwriter having a mid life and asking the existentialist question how did I get here ? Cut to 4 billion and forty years ago where he get a brief potted history of how this individual came in to being in an inferior remake of The Hammer And Tongs video of Fatboy Slim's Right Here Right Now . The film continues in this pretentious self indulgent manner where characters spout half baked existentialist tripe in a film about an Orchid . Yes an exotic flower because you see the eponymous Adaptation is all about natural selection that makes the audience believe we exist due to some miracle of nature and we should take great pride in this wonder of the natural world . Perhaps we do to an extent but when you watch like this you're constantly reminded of how everyone working in Hollywood has a more fortunate life than you have"

Many were wonderful, many were good, some were not so good, and a few were AWFUL !!!!This movie easily falls into my top 100 all time worthless shows. What a waste, from the incredibly bad acting to the ridiculous incantations of Cage as a twin.The show made very little sense until the final scene and even that was a let-down.Overall, this ranks with ""The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"".A waste of time, and money.IF this is what our shows are coming to, Heaven Help Us.

465,Adaptation.,10,29 December 2002,2/3 of a great movie; Donald Kaufman's triumph!,"Spike Jonze's direction on Adaptation is as creative and inspirational as in his debut, Being John Malkovich, and his writer(s), Charlie and Donald Kaufman (ho-ho), have gone to such lengths of self-indulgence and egotism they try to one-up Fellini's work. The film focuses on four characters, as we learn from the start, as Charlie (Cage, who like Eddie Murphy in the Nutty Professor, plays two Kaufman's on the screen at the same time in many scenes) receives Susan Orlean's (Meryl Streep) New York-style novel about a florist/orchid hunter named John LaRoche (Chris Cooper), and is asked to adapt it for a motion picture. While he faces personal struggles in doing a follow-up to his well received first effort, and feels unintended pressure from him twin brother Donald, as he writes conventional Hollywood junk, he finds the only way to write the story is to write himself, and more than he bargained for, in the script.Like I said, it's two thirds of a delving, sorrowful and glib take on screen writing, self-discovery, and unique flowers, and while Cage and Streep turn in some fine work, it's Cooper who takes the cake with possibly the second best supporting male performance of the year (first goes to Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York), as his character, with no front teeth and secrets that come out bit by bit, is the most compassionate and wacky. HOWEVER, in the last act we see the characters, in a sense, taken over more by Donald Kaufman, and he almost turns the picture into exactly what Charlie mentioned in the beginning what he didn't want! It's a challenge, I know, but it just isn't as believable and true as the rest of the film tries to be."
466,Adaptation.,8,12 July 2007,Kaufman's weakest effort,"I thought it was pretty ingenious, and very original, but it just didn't hook me like it should have. Everything involving the Kaufman brothers I loved; Cage gives probably his best performance here (probably because he's at his most un-Cage like) and the self-loathing that writer's block brings about was captured perfectly. I just wasn't involved at all in the story of Orlean and the orchids. I thought Streep was fairly unremarkable and Cooper was amusing, but definitely not Oscar-worthy. Once Donald takes over writing the story and all the Hollywood stuff comes pouring out it goes off the rails, as was the point, but I found it more silly than witty. The ending is kinda lame, too. Definitely my least favourite Kaufman film so far."
467,Adaptation.,10,20 December 2005,Brillliantly Funny Satire of the Writing Process with Fantastic Acting,"""Adaptation"" is not the first film to document how a screenwriter is a cog in the wheel of the Hollywood maw (""State and Main"" included that in its corrosive satire and further back of course the victim of ""Sunset Boulevard"" was an erstwhile screenwriter, as well as ""Barton Fink"") but it may be the first to exclusively, obsessively, and hysterically focus on the writer.The title turns out to be a multi-layered pun on writing a screenplay from a book and of surviving natural selection of evolution for life in general, and a movie-making ecology of metaphorical sharks, real alligators, phonies, manipulators, etc.The roman a clef touches from writer Charles Kaufman's past success with ""Being John Malkovich"" with alleged scenes from the shooting of that film, as this reunites the same team, and studios' and agents' references to it ground the film in some kind of reality (and will confuse anyone who hasn't seen that film) before veering back-and-forth into fantasies, dreams, leaps of imaginings, and back to some semblance of reality.The fantasy is continued through the credits, from the co-write with ""Donald Kaufman"" to the post-credit memoriam quote that you should stay for.Meryl Streep is marvelous as she gradually becomes a-typical and I don't think Chris Cooper has ever been less than wonderful anyway and is always on the brink of recognition for his enormous talents. Most of the audience I was with did not get the jokes, but I laughed heartily. (originally written 1/12/2003)At the BAFTA awards, the Brit equivalent of the Oscars, which allows people to accept for others, Meryl Streep read a fax from adapted screenplay author winners the brothers Kaufman for ""Adaptation."" It was hysterical! She claimed she hadn't seen it in advance so was reading it for the first time, that it was just handed to her. Kaufman wrote it in the style of the screenplay. About how he was struggling to figure out how to write a thanks. That he was so intimidated that Meryl would be reading it. That she's such a great actress and he hates to put her through this. That he felt pressure to write a good joke and was afraid that he would make Meryl feel bad if the joke didn't work, etc. etc. It was far and away the BEST acceptance speech I've ever heard. And whether Meryl was acting as planned or being spontaneous in her reactions, complete with a very funny spoonerism on the director's name, to what she was reading, she was brilliant too. (added 3/1/2003)"
468,Adaptation.,9,23 August 2005,Upon 3rd viewing...AMAZING!!!  (Small Spoilers),"I am sure many people have read MovieAddict2005's review. I am in the same boat as him. I bought this movie on a whim because my friend told me it was amazing. Upon the first viewing of the movie I got it...well I thought I got it. I was like clever, he is writing about himself and the script we are watching is the very one he is writing in the movie.Little did I know it goes much much deeper then this. For some odd reason I could not grasp the time frame and if Laroche's and Orlean's events are happening parallel to the events of Kaufman's or in the past or if it is actually what Kaufman is writing. Turns out I was not watching the movie close enough and they tell you at the bottom when the events of Laroche and Orleans are happening. A flub on my part.I could not get that this movie was making fun of itself and that Kaufman was writing a movie about writer's block when indeed he had writer's block. All the conventions and such that he speaks about in the movie he uses, but only to make fun of himself and the script.Upon the third viewing the light went off. My jaw dropped and I finally got it. it is an ingenious concept. Instead of adapting a book he writes ABOUT adapting the book while at the same time exploring the themes of love and actual adaptation in the human life. The script is funny because it talks about all the things you DON'T do in writing and in the end he ends up using them all. Thus cleverly making fun of himself.I really love this movie now; people say it grows on you and it certainly grew on me. I am in the same boat as MovieAddict2005. Give this message boards a view, understand what the movie is about and try it again, this really is a great movie with a wonderful script.I strongly recommend it, and if you don't get it the first time try it again."
469,Adaptation.,7,6 August 2005,one word summary,"To sum it up in one word, lets call it: ""prismatic."" Writer, mock thy reflection. It's an enjoyable light-hearted comedy with twinges of darkness. Cliché but original, almost Brechtian but, limits itself in an American style. The soundtrack is well done.In some ways this is a classic story, the search for a man's own ""true"" purpose stymied by the banality of reality. Kaufman's own self fascination taken to a new level where we can all feast on it and enjoy the benefits of his own hubris, his own flaws. In that way, its very masculine but captures elements of vulnerability and femininity, perhaps heightened by one of his many explorations. It could have been a masterpiece but it mocks itself nearly to the point of cliché. Nearly. The masterpiece was just out of reach. The masterpiece imho, had passed and he tells you in the story just what it was. Oh writer, what cute trite complexity you share."
470,Adaptation.,9,31 July 2005,Good ending,"I think that, in contrast to the above or below comment (can't be bothered working out where it will appear), this film has a fantastic ending. Throughout the film Charlie Kaufman struggles to find a way to express how amazing flowers are, and I think the ending shows how he has accomplished this. By making a film that conveys that very struggle, it shows the audience how amazing flowers are to him, and helps the audience see them through his eyes. The ending also shows Charlie has changed from the beginning of the film- an aspect of his screenplay that he initially wanted to avoid but came to realise was completely necessary.As to the rest of the film, Nicholas Cage does a great job of distinguishing his different roles, and for once the film suits the pained face he seems to exhibit in every film, whether appropriate or not."
471,Adaptation.,9,20 July 2005,Charlie and Donald,"Have you ever wondered if there was no Donald?But only a single writer who is confronted by stupid ideas from is own head?And that the movie is just about that confrontation?Not just about how Hollywood style is bad,but also about how a brilliant writer is capable of having such stupid ideas as those that Donald has.And that the process of writing an argument is something like the confrontation between the stupid and the genius? I've seen the movie a long time ago,but I think that the only scene where the fact of they being twins has any importance is when Donald talks to Susie pretending is Charlie.That wouldn't justify the choice,and Kaufman doesn't put such a detail in his argument just because ""it's cool,man!"". However,I don't think the movie is just about this.But I would like to know your points of view about this idea.I think there was Donald.And I think that Charlie proves how great he can be,by adding a typical detail of Hollywood movies but adapting it to a genius idea and using it to really make the movie better and giving to a brilliant actor a chance to shine."
472,Adaptation.,9,18 June 2005,Second best movie ever about writer's block.,"The basis: Charlie Kauffman, who is a real-life (and eccentric) director, was contracted to write the screenplay about a book called The Orchid Thief, which tells the true story of John LaRoche, who poaches rare orchids. Only the book doesn't offer a narrative that lends itself easily to a movie--it is filled with pages of what Charlie refers to as ""New Yorker"" style writing.So Charlie Kauffman ends up with writer's block, (we presume) self-condemning thoughts, and an increasing sense of panic, and decides to do the movie about his writer's block over The Orchid Thief, rather than about the book.Kauffman didn't know if the author would go for it, but when she read his screenplay draft, she said she liked it.In the movie, Charlie has a twin brother, and both parts are played by Nicolas Cage. Cage had the talent to create distinct personalities for both, and to masterfully control the relationship between the brothers. Thus it shows the dependence of the key players in film-making on each other--without Cage, Kauffman would not have had a clever movie, and vice versa.I am assuming that Charlie Kauffman does not have a real twin brother, and he just used this device to show his dueling struggles over his art. His brother takes somewhat of a paint-by-numbers approach to screen writing, and is writing a different screenplay filled with lots of overused clichés. A hint at this creative device is that his brother is writing a screenplay about someone with multiple personalities. I haven't read anything to verify my assumption, but I think I'm safe in saying this part is fiction.Kauffman could have used his 'twin brother' to mock fledgling writers who follow established rules rather than blaze their own independent path, and Charlie starts out taking this approach towards his brother (some of this interplay is quite amusing). But he ends up finding a fascinating reconciliation between the two extremes.It is a helpful movie for getting one back into a creative vein, but not too helpful. It is a bit of a dead-end also, because the movie is so self-referential and indulgent in its subject matter (writing about not being able to write). It tempts us along the same lines. Yet it also makes us aware of the reflexive nature of fiction--which has been used since the ancients--by placing the whole focus on it, like a tour through a hall of mirrors. The echoes set off between reality and fantasy seem almost endless. As one example, Chris Cooper, playing John LaRoche, is interested in knowing who will play him in the movie, and states this more than once. As another, we see scenes of Nicolas Cage playing Charlie Kauffman making his previous movie, complete with the actors who actually played in the previous movie. It can be a little of a challenge even talking about the movie, as noticeable in paragraph 3: Is this the real Charlie Kauffman, or the movie Charlie Kauffman, and how do we know which is which anyway? I enjoyed watching the individual characters, who were all flawed but shown to us honestly. I particularly liked Charlie's brother, who seems almost simpleminded compared to his famous brother. But he had a sincerity, a directness, and a positive attitude that are endearing to watch. Seeing these two brothers interact, we are reminded of all brotherly relationships.If there is a more clever movie about writer's block, there's probably only one--Felini's 8 1/2, a complex and at times bewildering movie. I liked both."
473,Adaptation.,,4 April 2005,"or, a hasty prank I handed in for homework","not kaufman's best script. it's clever, but it lacks heart. ""he"" (the kaufman character) tells us ""he"" couldn't make a movie from the novel. it has the feel of a last minute joke submitted as an exercise. professionally crafted, to be sure, just not good.it's become pedestrian to lament the differences between a book and a movie directly based on that book, but again, it's useful to read ""the orchid thief"". it has amazing characters, and it's all about orchids and the specific fascination these plants inspire. but there is no plot. orlean herself undertakes expeditions to look at the plants in the swamp, thus appearing as a subject in the observations.he uses the struggle of the writing process as a jumping off point for a ... chase movie? with guns? quiet bonding moments? death?when I heard that line I cringed.spike jonze is competent and unobtrusive here. cage is the weakest compared to streep and cooper, both of whom are brilliant."
474,Adaptation.,10,4 October 2004,the movie is genius,"I wasn't going to bother commenting on this but the front page review on here is actually negative for this film! I was shocked. Adaptation has to be, easily, the most innovative and mind engulfing movie I've seen in a long time. Just in case there are those who watching this and didn't realize what Charlie Kaufman was actually accomplishing with this, I'm going to attempt to break it down:The movie is about the actual Screenwriter, trying to adapt a book thats unadaptable...but in the process, adapts the book by wrapping his attempts to comprehend its story, into the larger story. Kaufman invents a twin brother who embodies slapdash, formulaic Hollywood. He's lazy, cliché'd and completely convenient inside the movie to represent what Charlie is fighting against doing himself. Donald makes Charlie's attempt to write a quality story more punctuated by showing how redundant mainstream Hollywood movies are.I haven't read the Orchid Thief, but the arc involving Streep and Cooper is more than likely what the book is about, only in a documentary-ish kind of way. This allows kaufman in the screenplay to explore all the extraneous meanings of ""adaptation"" through Cooper's character's love of Orchids and plants in general. And the last thing that I want to comment on is the ending. I remember reading reviews when it comes out that the ending completely falls apart and blah blah etc etc...when in fact the end of the movie is exactly in the same vein as the rest of the movie. Charlie struggles, and flounders in the whole movie to build and then finish the movie. Meanwhile, Donald creates, writes, and gets made his movie in that time. So when the movie finally starts to kinda hit the wall what happens? It turns into a panicked, Hollywood style ending replete with every cliché that Charlie refuses to cave in to earlier in the movie. Something that makes total sense after Charlie relents and see's the Script Writing Guru, and asks for advice from his brother. Wam Bam, the movie is done and the sour taste in a thoughtful movie goers mouth is deliberate and therefore genius. Donald Kaufman gets a screen writing credit on the movie hinting that he was the one who actually wrote the ending, and gets it dedicated to him to further blur the line between, ""did this really happen??""There are just so many great things in this movie that are slipped in, it has to be watched multiple times, it's amazing."
475,Adaptation.,10,24 June 2004,The Ghost Orchid.,"Yet another clever collaboration from director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, Adaptation plays with and makes fun of itself to the viewer's delight, or discontent. At the risk of sounding pompous, I think many people missed the mark of the film, particularly the end. It's a film about a book, but more so a film about writing a screenplay....for the same film you're watching. It might sound original, it might sound like a cop-out, but to me it was very clever.First off, Nicolas Cage is genius in this film for his portrayal of twin brothers. It's been a long time since he's been in anything other than Hollywood blockbusters, so it's good to see him go back to his roots. Chris Cooper as John Laroche is simply marvelous...where did he come from? I've seen him in several films before but never have I seen him give such an amazingly convincing acting job. And I don't have any idea how they got rid of his two front teeth here. He's a rough character, but there's something about him that makes him nothing short of lovable. He deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this. Meryl Streep is always excellent in her roles and her veteran skills show. Overall, a very talented cast.There are also some very interesting cinematography techniques here that I also enjoyed, particularly the dawn of man sequence. The score is also quite suiting.Spoilers: Go no further if you haven't seen it, it's not one you would want to ruin.Why does everyone who doesn't enjoy this film blame it on the end?! Yes, Charlie writes himself into the story and yes it ends in typical Hollywood blockbuster fashion, but did these same people fail to notice that it only got Hollywood-ized once Charlie asked for help from his brother who writes such stories? Did anyone notice that? I can't help but to get a little annoyed at some of the reviews here that say good things about the film and then something to the effect of, ""until the end."" I don't think I'm smarter than you, but really, how can you not get that?! Maybe some people do get it and still don't like it though. Maybe some think it's an easy way out. For me, it was quite enjoyable, clever, and totally unexpected. It's what makes the film for me.End of Spoilers.If you have yet to see this movie, I highly recommend it. It's got excellent cinematography, acting, editing, and most of all a truly original story that had my head spinning the first time I saw it. If you like Being John Malkovich, also from Jonze and Kaufman, then you should like Adaptation. I would like to say more about this film, but I'd hate to give anything away.Very highly recommended, but not for everyone."
476,Adaptation.,10,19 August 2003,"A mesmerising, utterly original cinematic masterpiece.","I pride myself on being a pretty touch critic when it comes to movies. Really. It takes a lot for me to deem a movie as being really good... but I quite honestly could not fault this fascinating little slice of modern cinema. Quite simply, everything from the performances and cinematography to the writing and directing was executed perfectly.However, explaining the concepts of the film to someone who hasn't seen it is quite a task. Nicolas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman (who wrote the movie), and also plays Charlie's fictitious younger brother, Ronald, an aspiring filmmaker with plenty of ambition but an unfortunately naïve outlook. Meanwhile, Charlie is trying to work out how to adapt Susan Orlean's novel, ""The Orchid Thief"", to the big screen, and the result is the film unfolding before our very eyes. Essentially, this is a movie about how the movie itself came to pass, mixed with some amusing self-reflection from Charlie Kaufman and an interesting tale of a misogynistic author's (Meryl Streep is both vulnerable and dangerous as Susan) affair with an orchid thief. Nicolas Cage pulls of the rare feat of delivering a truly outstanding comic performance by playing two roles at once. Chris Cooper is perhaps even better as thief John Laroche, who lacks material possessions but is nonetheless truly content with his lifestyle - serving as a reminder of the human need to feel passionately about something in our lives. If it all sounds a bit confusing, it is, but I assure you - Adaptation is an oft-overlooked piece of cinematic genius: intelligent, daring and as close to the perfect movie as we're likely to get.Grade: A+"
477,Adaptation.,2,20 July 2003,"Not a gem, but a clunker","This film was not only uninteresting - It was BORING. It represents what Hollywood is putting out these days - a blend of insider blather, sugar coated with sensationalism and sex - to the rhasodizing of the sycophantic press and other acolytes who depend on the industry for their living. The screenplay was disjointed and unbeliveable, Nick Cage and Meryl Streep just showed up and hit their marks, and despite his Academy Award for this effort, Chris Cooper didn't impress much either. I was very disappointed."
478,Adaptation.,,23 June 2003,We All Must Adapt.,"In the tradition of ""Being John Malkovich"", director Spike Jonze created a movie that is very unique and vastly interesting with ""Adaptation"". Unfortunately unique and interesting do not necessarily translate into excellence on the silver screen. This is the case with this movie. Real-life ""Being John Malkovich"" screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Oscar-nominee Nicolas Cage) has just been penned to adapt the novel ""The Orchid Thief"". The novel though is far from an easy book to transfer into a screenplay. As Cage struggles with his work, his twin-brother Donald (also played by Cage) is creating a successful screenplay of his own. A nervousness around women, a hypochondriac nature and equality issues haunt Cage and his work becomes a jumble because of it. Flashbacks follow New York novelist Meryl Streep (Oscar-nominated) as she writes her book with the help of eccentric plant hunter Chris Cooper (Oscar-winning) in the Florida Everglades. Cooper is quietly hilarious, but has a dark past and definitely has a sadness about him that cannot be ignored. Streep herself is sad because she has no real love or desire in anyone or anything in life. The relationship between Streep and Cooper in the book has undertones of a mutual romance that is shared, but Cage just cannot see the makings of his screenplay in Streep's musings. Maybe his otherwise dim-witted twin can help solve the dilemma. The two story-lines mix and mesh and create a story that basically runs around in a never-ending circle. Like ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Adaptation"" starts off very strong because it is so outlandish, but the gimmicks become a bit tiring in the second hour. The last 20 minutes of the picture hurt the numerous good things that were accomplished in the first 90 or so minutes. Kaufman and Jonze have some great ideas, but their execution of those ideas is sometimes very questionable. Cara Seymour, Tilda Swinton and Judy Greer all seem out of place as the women in Cage's life. Streep's performance is way over-rated as well. She was much better in ""The Hours"" and overall that production was more of a triumph as well. Cage and Cooper both carry the film almost by themselves. Cage is a revelation, playing two parts that are so totally different and yet have an opaque similarity. Cooper dominates the first hour of the film, but his character loses steam and lacks the full-development that he should have had. Overall ""Adaptation"" is a good film, but it needs a little more intelligence and a lot more heart. 4 stars out of 5."
479,Adaptation.,,6 June 2003,What is so hard to understand?,"I just don't get the people who don't get this film.  What is so hard to understand?  The movie mirrors the screenwriter's experiences, and does so exceedingly well.(slight spoiler warning here!)To those who say the film breaks down in the last act, can't you see that this in intentional?  It's no accident that it becomes formulaic just as Charles starts attending writing seminars and asking his brother for help with his script.  This is the most clever aspect of the film, for god's sake.  Don't dismiss it, embrace it!Why do people write up little critiques of films they don't even bother watching?  Arrggh! This is exactly the type of film we should all be encouraging. Screenwriters with Kaufman's intelligence, humour and originality are a dying breed."
480,Adaptation.,,4 June 2003,A slap in Hollywood's face,"This script is so clever and funny, you can not help but laugh at how ingenious the whole thing is.  The apprehensive Charlie Kaufman is trying to adapt a book by Susan Orlean into a movie all while avoiding the traditional Hollywood cliches and trademarks (i.e. car chases, drugs, gun fights). Kaufman is trapped in writer's block and is having trouble meeting deadlines.  Meanwhile, Charlie's antithesis and twin brother Donald chooses to write movies like his brother.  As Charlie nears his deadline with his project incomplete, it becomes easier for Donald to write his own.  The movie culminates in a funny yet touching ending that will keep you thinking, as well as laughing.  The characters themselves, particularly those played by Nicholas Cage and Chris Cooper are as true as they possibly could be. A truly brilliant script, and aptly title as well."
481,Adaptation.,9,3 June 2003,A Masterful Piece Of Writing,"Charlie Kaufman's hyperactive imagination is on full display in this, his second collaboration with director Spike Jonze (the first was the bemusing `Being John Malkovich') but this time there's so much fertility in Kaufman's musings that the little technique Jonze brings to the project is obscured. Kaufman's theme (actually more of an obsession) about a cell dividing into complete opposites is used in virtually every aspect of his script which veers in so many directions that it's almost dizzying trying to keep up. It's based on Kaufman's attempt (true, one supposes) to adapt an unadaptable piece of non-fiction (Susan Orlean's `The Orchid Thief') but moves exponentially into fantasies about a twin brother who writes pulp screenplays snarfed up by agents (while he's trying to write a serious one) as well as Orlean herself and the relationship that evolves between her and her subject, an enigmatic but brilliant Florida horticulturist. The Kaufman twins are played by a well-cast Nicolas Cage who manages to straddle the line between farce and reality and does so with a surety that only confirms his commitment. Orlean is played by Meryl Streep who displays an unexpected sexiness that she pushes to her limits and Chris Cooper is wonderful as John Laroche, the eccentric white trash horticulturalist around whom the story really revolves. Unfortunately, Jonze provides Kaufman's controlled lunacy a pedestrian, literal approach, suggesting that he may not be the best interpreter of this particular type of material. Still, thanks to Kaufman's prodigious writing talent and some very fine performances, `Adaptation' is a must-see."
482,Adaptation.,,3 June 2003,"Delightful, multi-layered film that examines, with great humor and skill, how to ""adapt""...particularly to the distress of disillusionment.","A sketchy, humorous film about characters caught in the throes of anxiety over their inadequacies, centering on twin screenwriters in the form of Nicholas Cage, whose involvement with an ""unscreenworthy"" book leads to a dramatic, albeit mundane, catharsis.  It's the brilliantly eccentric way that all factors of the story come together that makes the film adventurous and though-provoking (adjectives so missing from the current spate of Hollywood offerings that it's not hard to appreciate this meaningful gem). Add to that the fact that all of the performances in the film are stupendous."
483,Adaptation.,2,1 June 2003,Painful to watch,"I have no idea how this movie ended. The casting was excellent, as was the acting but after watching the loser protagonist fail to advance his cause an inch until he finally calls his vacuous twin for assistance halfway through the film, I walked out. Cage's character was clearly established as a pathetic human being 10 minutes into the film and there was no need to repeat his shortcomings over and and over. We get it, he's a shmuck! Streep and Cooper would have made a good film without the Cage twins."
484,Adaptation.,10,1 June 2003,A great movie.,"""Adaptation"" is one of the best movies I've seen in over 50 years. The acting is exceptional, and there are so many levels and nuances in the film that it is extraordinarily fascinating. I can understand why some people don't like the ending, because if you don't know what's going on you will be lost by then. Maybe you have to be in the mood for the movie, maybe you have to watch it more than once. It might help to read a good review *before* watching - Roger Ebert's review is excellent. Do whatever you have to do to get to a place where you thoroughly enjoy the movie - it's a great one."
485,Adaptation.,,31 May 2003,"Funny, Frightening and Sexy","Spike Jonze has shown his genius once again. He is one of the fewdirector around who has a unique vision and style. Tis story is as smartand complex and funny as Being John Malkovich. Anyone who has ever beento a Hollywood screenwriting seminar would know why. His casting choicesare brilliant also. Nicholas Cage is at his maniacal best playing therole of identical twin brothers who are like Jekyl and Hyde. MerylStreep is still the best actress around and also proves that is, atmiddle age, still sexier than all the twenty-something actresses thatcrowd the screen in most films. Chris Cooper has been one of myfavorites since I first saw him in John Sayles' Lone Star. Also TildaSwinton, Cara Setmour and Brian Cox radiate an inner intensity that morewell known actors could conjour up if their lives depended on it. Yougotta see this film to"
486,Adaptation.,6,27 February 2003,"I Got It (Still, It's Not Funny)","I confess: I had my hopes high for this one. ""Being John Malkovich"" was hilariosly insane, created with a wit and drive bound to take you away. With even more praise for this one, I hoped a new sensation.But alas. This was at best a mediocre film. The interesting plot about deconstructivism and the deconstruction of that plot ruined the film and made it's points seemed forced and perplexed. This had nothing like the energy of Malkovich, and the whole meta-thing wasn't fullfilled decently. Which made me yawn. I never thought Kaufman could be like All The Other Screenwriters and make me do that. But I did - I yawned.Chris Cooper was the true highlight, Meryl was merylly, Nic Cage was fine. The direction however seemed tame and uninspired. I give this a 6/10. Still, I'm disappointed and definately not amused."
487,Adaptation.,3,22 February 2003,Tries to pass off hip cynicism as artistic integrity,"""Being John Malkovich"" was seriously flawed in places, but at least an interesting attempt. ""Adaptation"" doesn't ever know where it's going, and it tries to substitute hip cynicism for creativity and artistic integrity. I'm surprised that Streep consented to be in it. There's nothing sadder than a black comedy that ain't funny!""Adaptation"" has the same adolescent qualities as a movie like ""Trainspotting,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" and all of the Cohen Bros. stuff: mix a little potty humor with sudden violence and a couple of clever ideas; play with the audience and trash all the main characters; finish off with a heavy dose of cynicism, and Oh, Brother! a hip box office success-- if not a blockbuster.Thankfully there are a few artists, like Polanski,  who manage to reach the silver silver screen."
488,Adaptation.,3,2 February 2003,waste of my time,"Sorry, I tried to look at this movie from an optimistic point of view, but as it went on and on I just couldn't any more.  It's just not an entertaining piece on any level.  After the 1h 20m of character development, I was too bored to deal with the last half an hour of actual substance. Anyways, I felt nothing for any of the characters   and would not recommend that anyone see this film."
489,Adaptation.,3,11 January 2003,I must of missed it somehow? Without Chris Cooper this would make my ten worst!,"I always like to reward risk taking in Hollywood since it almost never happens, but to just take risks and do the wrong thing for the hell of it is a waste of time , talent, and money. Adaptation is slow, badly directed, badly edited and had only one good thing that kept it off my infamous horrible list. Yet it is the kind of off the wall artsie-fartsie stuff that the critics get all tear eyed about so expect it to get a lot of good reviews and maybe even some honors.Take my word on this one folks.  This is a boring , slow , stinko, wrapped in a pretty bag.Nicolas Cage plays a dual role as the Kaufman brothers, Charlie and Donald. It is a demanding role but the screen play about the psycho killer that is cop, killer and victim would have been a lot more interesting than this thing. Meryal Streep was poorly used and not memorable at all as Susan Orlean the so called New York City writer who wrote for the New Yorker the original story that started the book that started the adaptation that....are you confused yet? There is no such thing as a spoiler in this ""thing"" since clearly Jonze didn't have a clue where it was going and anything I would write here would only further confuse you......??? Ok, It has one good thing. Chris Copper plays John LaRoche, a tortured by his past, orchid expert that has no front teeth. I'll say this though, LaRoche is a well acted and interesting role and if anyone gets a consideration for an award from this thing it should be Chris Cooper. So there it is.  Too bad to even watch on cable but read the other reviews and figure I'm a nut, but go see this thing and let me be the first to say ""I told you so""!"
490,Adaptation.,6,9 January 2003,WHAT WAS IT??????,"Went to see the preview tonight, and I still do know what I saw as far as a story line goes.  Nicholas Gage was outstanding in his duel role, and Meryl Streep was excellent in her role, but it was a draggy two hours of a mixed up story of mixed up lives.  Wait for the video to come out."
491,Adaptation.,6,2 January 2003,A moderately entertaining movie that was too violent in parts,"The premise and plot of the movie were interesting and somewhat engaging. Indeed, it imparts several important life lessons.  Unfortunately, I felt the movie was marred by some several unexpected and very violent scenes that were unnecessary and detracted greatly from the movie.Please know that I enjoy action and war movies that may contain graphic violence (e.g. Saving Private Ryan.)  But in this movie, the violent scenes served no real purpose in what was otherwise a thoughtful comedy and actually ruined my enjoyment of the entire film.Cage's role as twins was above average but not great.  Streep was excellent.Wait for the rental to come out."
492,Adaptation.,3,20 December 2002,It's clever.  Very Clever.,"As with 'Being John', we are left with the remains of a creative mind goneunchecked.  I saw the movie at  a private screening with a young, appreciative audience.  I agreed with them that the script is clever; only, I think it's too clever for its own good.  It's arch and self-referential (reverential?) and bulging with irony.  In other words, I found it predictable and plodding.  But it was clever. Very clever.  Too bad it--as with its predecessor--didn't have a heart. (Cage does manage to redeem himself from the awful choices he's made in the pastfew years, starting with 'The Rock'. )  In all, a treat from Hollywood, considering the unbearable lightness of recent movies, but really more a gee-whiz youngman's movie than anything substantial.  (Will Kaufman ever write a script that is substantial?  Too soon to say.  Recently, I read where someone had comparedhim to Preston Sturges.  Would but that were true!)"
493,Adaptation.,5,1 January 2009,Weird Movie WIth A Flat Ending,"I watched this movie with high expectations. I expected a complex movie on the lines of Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind which can have a human side to it too. Instead what I saw was a regular movie with a story about an underdog winning in the end. I know that is oversimplifying the story of Adaptation. But that's how it ended up. The story starts out as something quirky and interesting but it leads to a generic happy ending(not that happy though) which, I suspect, Charlie Kaufman himself would not approve. Yet this is what he does in this movie.The story is a movie featuring a protagonist named Charlie Kaufman(Nicholas Cage) who is a screenwriter having problems of writer's block. Sure, it sounds like 8 1/2. But it is nothing like that. Charlie Kaufman is asked to write a screenplay based on a book by Susan Orleans(Meryl Streep). The book is about a man named Paul Laroche(Chris Cooper) who is obsessed about plants and flowers. The problem is Charlie Kaufman is unsure how to make a movie about an abstract idea such as flowers and plants. This storyline is interspersed with the flashback of how Susan Orleans meets Laroche. Also in this story is Charlie's twin brother Donald who has a happy go lucky approach to life, which Charlie is unable to understand. There is also a story about Charlie's lovelife and loneliness which is tinged with sadness throughout.On paper it sounds good. So what went wrong? The problem is the lack of direction in the movie. The third act is so ridiculous that it makes the first 1 hour seem so pointless. It seems like a somewhat failed attempt at satire. The last half is supposed to be sad and touching(I guess) but it doesn't feel like that. It feels cold. Nicholas Cage's performance is a part of the problem, I feel. He is a good actor who shows his ability in humorous scenes but in emotional scenes he doesn't deliver. Another problem is the story of Susan orleans. It just drags on without much of a point. Chris Cooper's(I didn't recognise him!) performance is pretty good. Meryl Streep, IMO, is the actual star as her tremendous screen presence and beauty is enough to carry this film somewhat. But even she can't save this film. Btw this movie has encouraged me to watch more movies of hers. She is such a beauty! Her transformation towards the end is interesting although it seems quite unbelievable. This is another problem I have with this movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal has nothing to do in this movie and I am surprised to see her in such a minor role.The transformation of Charlie Kaufman himself is not portrayed convincingly. Unlike in other movies of his like Eternal sunshine where the characters are written convincingly and there is a human side to the whole story(despite the complexity), this movie fails at that. It fails to draw the viewer in and viewers may not relate to the character portrayed in this movie. That is the primary problem and I feel that's where the movie falls apart.5/10(Because of the innovative idea and Meryl Streep's performance)"
494,Adaptation.,4,1 November 2005,less than average,"I like character studies, I like black comedies, I like Nicolas Cage but I did not like this movie. The way it jumped between 2 sets of characters, one having flashbacks the other dreams left the whole thing feeling disjointed and lacking flow. The characters lacked any endearing characteristics leading to a total indifference towards what happens to them. However the voice overs by cage (especially his intro of himself)was the saving grace of the film taking it from an awful 1 to a less than average 4. I should have known better it was created by the same people that created ""Being John Malkovich"" and I found that a little less than average as well. If you too like character studies, black comedies and Nicolas Cage then see ""Matchstick Men""."
495,Adaptation.,5,14 June 2003,Adaptation.: 5/10,"Watch out! Adaptation. is the weirdest movie sinceI don't know, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Human Nature, or Being John Malkovich? All four of these have been written by Charlie Kaufman, and Adaptation. is his weirdest yet.. It's not to say it's his best (that honor goes to Confessions), nor funniest, but it still racks up points on the weirdness scale.Kaufman writes himself into a real life situation he had. He was chosen to adapt Susan Orlean's nonfiction book The Orchid Thief, but could never seem to do it. So he wrote the screenplay to Adaptation., about his struggle. He's an aging, bald, fat, dateless man who was given the job to adapt Orlean's book. He has trouble, while his brother Donald is starting to make it in the business with a stupid horror cliché The Three. And then it gets weird.One burning question is on my mind: Why did Chris Cooper win Best Supporting Actor? All he had was a set of fake `teeth' and a part that didn't even seem challenging. What Orlean (Meryl Streep) says about him, that he's a very interesting character, I didn't really see. His character didn't interest me at all, and I wasn't exactly in pain when he was in the screen, but I wasn't exactly smiling.Overall, this was a better movie that Being John Malkovich, but was nowhere near as funny (which is kind of pathetic, because I didn't really think Malkovich was that funny). I think I laughed twice, which, for a comedy, isn't that good, but since it has such a quirky style I can forgive it. Quirky movies have always had a special place in my heart, but this one was a little too weird, such as Kaufman dictating a screenplay, which actually turns out to be for the movie we're watching.Nicolas Cage, who played both Charlie and Donald, did better than, say, Gone in 60 Seconds, but definitely wasn't Oscar-caliber. Streep and Cooper, ditto. I didn't really find anything to suck me into the film, and the last third was just plain preposterous and unlikely. It really brought down the film a whole lot, from being marginally good to being semi-ok.One other point against Adaptation. is that it was everything it tried to be. Kaufman stated that he didn't want his adaptation of The Orchid Thief to be a Hollywood film; he didn't want Orlean and John Laroche to fall in love, he didn't want clichés or sex, and he wanted things to make sense. Kaufman was wrong, then.My rating: 5/10Rated R for language, sexuality, some drug use and violent images."
496,Adaptation.,8,8 September 2003,Nothing compares to the beauty of this film...not even a flower,"When you're a fan of cinema...and I mean a true fan...you often think: ""If I see ONE more over-hyped and over-budgeted movie, I'm going to scream !!!""... For that exact reason, Adaptation is one the most brilliant movie made recently. It's a proof that it's still possible to create a motion picture that fascinates without the overuse of explosions, CGI and spectacular car chases. Other than that, Adaptation is an original and dared idea. It's about real people and yet, they don't see themselves as heroes...on the contrary, I would say. Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman are talented. There's no doubt about that. Being John Malkovich wasn't one of my favorite movies but I can't deny it was a good and new idea. Adaptation is like that as well and this IS one of my favorites now. All elements of good cinema are here and in the right proportions. Story, directing, performances, unexpected plot twists...Nothing to complain. The story is about Charlie Kaufman ( the scriptwriter himself ) facing a huge writer's block. He wants to tell a beautiful story about simple flowers without using unreal elements ( unlike his invented twin brother Donald, who's creating a supernatural thriller script ) Charlie's story is based on a book called ""Orchid Thief"" and he has to meet the writer of that if he ever wants it to be finished. The beauty about this film is the image Charlie has of himself. Everyone looks at him like he's a genius, but personally he thinks he's a big coward and an ugly, fat and pathetic single man. You really feel sorry for him when he desperately tries to contact women and he makes you feel happy you're NOT him ! It's one of the best character portraits I've ever seen ! Not only Nicolas Cage is perfect in his (double) role...The cast is filled with class-A actors. Meryl Streep gives her best performance since The Deer Hunter and Chris Cooper deserved the Oscar he received...and that's the least you can say. Even the smaller roles by for example Brian Cox and Maggie Gyllenhaal are flawless. Mark my words, Maggie is going to become one of the greatest and most respected actresses in the next ten years.Adaptations is one of those few movies you really HAVE TO see ! There are tons of reasons to do so: cinematic value, pure genius, originality and creativity and so on...Even if you don't care for all these things mentioned, you STILL have to see it ! Just to realize your life ain't that bad as you think it is...I can't wait for further movies by this wonderful team ( Jonze-Kaufman)And Nicolas Cage is back in the immortal section to me! Always thought he was a great actor, but I did believe his golden years were the 80's. Now, with this film and Leaving Las Vegas he has proved he can handle every role and every genre...but I prefer him as the pathetic loser instead of the action hero. That's just me, though.One final comment : Beware of Adaptation if you recently had a traumatic experience with cars ( Small spoiler here as well ). I should know because I had a terrible car accident not so long ago. Adaptation has 2 very VERY realistic car accidents in it, and I assure you you blink your eyes a few times when they're showed. Extremely real and not pleasant to watch !!"
497,Adaptation.,5,25 September 2008,Mediocre,"Adaptation was a highly lauded film, critically, but nowhere near a great film. Yes, Chris Cooper won an Oscar for his turn as botanist John LaRoche, & it is a good performance until the film tanks, as well as his acting. Again, it's no defense to claim the screenplay or director wanted deliberately bad, hammy, over-the-top acting. Anyone who's seen CC in earlier roles in John Sayles films such as Matewan or Lone Star knows he is 1 of the best actors of our times. Adaptation is not in a league with either of those 2 performances. Anyway, here's the basic précis of the film: The L.A. screenwriter of the film Being John Malkovich- Charlie Kaufman (played by Nicolas Cage)- is having trouble adapting the next film assignment he's been given. The book is a non-fiction best-seller called The Orchid Thief, written by a Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep)- a writer for The New Yorker- about an oddball character, who is obsessed with orchids, she was sent to profile for a magazine piece. This is CC's LaRoche character. The book (a real book, by the way) proves difficult to adapt- for both its substance & its style. So the fictional CK character is stuck. Now, here's the 1st twist: the real CK, who wrote the actual film, decided to create a fictional twin brother for the fictional version of himself. This character is Donald Kaufman (also played by Nicolas Cage). Here's where the 1st problems with the film arises- & it's not about Post-Modernism, but then the film exploits every known cliché about writers & twins. CK has writer's block, & suffers, & is an outcast, filled with angst, & a putz around pretty women. His brother is his near exact opposite- smooth, witty, uncreative, not-too bright, yet he tries to mimic his brother by becoming a screenwriter & working on the text for a dull slasher film. CK, of course, disdains & looks down upon DK.Of course, the rest of the film follows a pretty predictable track, even as it intercuts between the artistic dilemmas of the 2 brothers, CK's going to a screen writing guru (at DK's behest), & the presumed 'real' tale of John LaRoche & SO's profiling of him. Predictability sets in when CK's artistic paralysis increases, DK's screenplay is lauded as brilliant by CK's agent & he gets a huge advance, then CK turns to his brother for advice on how to finish his adaptation of The Orchid Thief. DK ends up going to interview SO about the book, posing as CK- who requested it. DK suspects that SO is a liar & hiding her true feelings for JL. This is where the film really tanks- what happens next is so predictable I feel almost foolish extrapolating- but here goes: this is where DK's 'influence' on the real 'outer' screenplay is felt. De facto- this is where the real Charlie Kaufman (not the NC version) felt he could slack off, & indulge all his worst instincts & fob off the film's failings on the Post-Modernist crutch. Let me chart the precipitous plunge. Basically, SO & JL turn out to be drug-addled lovers who capture the spying CK (who's followed SO to Florida with his brother to see what she's up to). They plan to murder him & dump him in the swamps where JL went hunting orchids. DK, of course, kiboshes the plan & both twins become the hunted. DK ends up dead, along with JL, & CK heads back to L.A. for the film's denouement, to explain lessons learned. The fictive DK is credited as co-writer & the film even ends with a memorial dedication to the dead fictive writer.Here is where the film's advocates declaim its brilliance- that the film is actually mocking predictability by being predictable because, of course, this was the fictional DK's influence. That the real film does not tell us more about the interesting characters from the actual book is glossed over in favor of the real CK's presumption of his own (or his fictive self's) interestingness is treated as some artistic breakthrough, when it's really an infantile throwback to the 'art' films of the 1960s & 1970s. The best performance in the film actually comes from perpetually underrated standout actor Brian Cox, as the screen writing guru Robert McKee who inspires DK, then CK. There are the obligatory star cameos by actors from Being John Malkovich playing themselves- including director Spike Jonze, John Malkovich, Catherine Keener, John Cusack, & the real Susan Orlean playing a woman in a grocery store."
498,Adaptation.,1,4 September 2006,Worst movie of all time #1: So everyone agrees it's a stupid movie,"If I can save one person from wasting their time with this movie, then I can feel it was almost worth it to go through the pain of watching as much of it as I did:This is the only movie I've ever walked out of. Ya, it has got to be the worst movie of all time. Even the guy who says he 'gets it' agrees that it descends into a stupid finish. Oh! I figured out how stupid it was without even 'getting' it.I can't believe anyone would even stand up for a movie like this. Why? Even the tagline admits how confusing it is.The only comedy in it is in the author's head.Drama? If you enjoy watching beautiful things dying a grisly death, ya, I guess you would enjoy this 'drama'. It fits the same mold."
499,Adaptation.,3,18 May 2005,Good for a sleeping pill,Adaptation which was released in 2002 stars Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep both of whom are great actors and Adaptation is also a drama comedy. Adaptation's plot is Charlie Kaufman (Cage) is a man who tries to adapt a book by Susan Orlean (Streep) into a movie. Adaptation was also directed by Spike Jonze. Jonze was also nominated for an Oscar for Being John Malkovich. Adaptation has been hailed by many critics and nominated for four Oscars. So far Adaptation sounds like a great movie but it isn't. In the end Adaptation turns out to be extremely boring. Great actors like Streep and Cage aren't enough to save this over rated Oscar winner which turns out to be a sleeping pill.
500,Adaptation.,7,6 January 2007,Adaptation.,"The film first sees John Malkovich in his role in Being John Malkovich, and obviously, this film is the same director, Spike Jonze. The story focuses on that film's writer, Charlie Kaufman (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Nicholas Cage) and his struggle to create a new film about flowers, which hasn't been done before. He basically wants to turn an orchid book by flower enthusiast Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) into a screenplay. Her story, shown in flashbacks before Charlie's time, based her book on the life of eccentric flower enthusiast and soon lover John Laroche (Oscar winning Chris Cooper). Charlie's twin brother Donald (Cage again) is writing his new screenplays with ease. Also starring Cara Seymour as Amelia Kavan, Narnia's Tilda Swinton as Valerie Thomas, Ron Livingston as Marty Bowen, X2's Brian Cox as Robert McKee and Secretary's Maggie Gyllenhaal as Caroline Cunningham. It is an intriguing story that shows the struggle of what many screen writers might go through. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, it was nominated The British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay. Meryl Streep was number 58, and Nicolas Cage number 33 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Streep was also number 26 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!"
501,Adaptation.,1,20 July 2006,"Definitely one of the worst movies ever, although dressed up like a =good= movie","Incredibly stupid movie pretending to be =intellectual= with all those flashbacks, out-of-thin-air dialogs, and loathsome Cage duplicated to secure some best male actor award. Poor Kaufman, baby, you're still sweating to earn your million on something =slower= (for typical popcorn addict) than X-Men? Of course, there is lot of people who actually think the mumblings and revelations played by Cage are something ingenious. Hey, wake up, it's all about money you pay for a simple pleasure to feel yourself a little bit egghead - at the very moment you're discussing the film with your date. Hey, there is no irony, not even a shadow of humor except probably for that crocodile at the flourishing catharsis, naturally!!!! Well, the movie only =means something= for King Kong fans. I would rather recommend South Park, to get some fresh air after this 100% artificial, commercially-calculated masterpiece."
502,Adaptation.,3,25 July 2005,A film made for the critics ...,"This is a film made for the critics, not for moviegoers. The writing is great, but the actual film is dreadful. I was incredibly bored after the first 30 minutes.While watching the film, everyone that was with me either started falling asleep or leaving. And where's the key sociological message? The best of movies are trying to send a message, like Michael Bay's ""The Island"" and even other films like ""Fight Club."" This film does not do that.I also wish that Nicolas Cage's character was more confident. Him being uncomfortable makes everyone watching the film feel uncomfortable as well."
503,Adaptation.,7,25 January 2005,Stupendous,"This film has an amazing script and an amazing story. From the book by Susan Orlean ""The Orchid Thief"" (also one of the characters) sets a great atmosphere for the Kaufman brothers to write themselves into the film, with ""two"" outstanding performances as the twin brothers.It starts with Charlie Kaufman, trying to define what his life is about after he has just been on the set of ""Being John Malkovich"".He then sets out to write the script for ""The Orchid Thief"" basing himself in his script. In case you haven't up on what's happening yet, this is it. Charlie Kaufman has written a film with his brother Donald, in which he has based himself and his brother, in which he is writing a script, in which he is basing himself and his brother, if you get my drift.Anyway, back to the film.After Charlie tries anxiously desperately to find a good beginning for his script, and failing to, miserably, Donald decides to write a thriller from scratch, and whilst doing so, catches himself a girlfriend, finishes his script before Charlie and receives a whole load more publicity than Charlie, by Charlie's agent - a bit embarrassing, eh.Following Donald's success, Charlie gets writing, and removes himself from his depressing world, into a new exciting world.Unfortunately, after the brothers spot Susan Orlean getting into the truck of John Laroche (The Orchid Thief), they decide to follow them back to John's house, therefore leading to the chase sequence in the swamps before the deaths of both Donald and John in two freak accidents.With two very good supporting roles from Meryl Streep as Susan and Chris Cooper as John, this film excels in the Drama genre.Four-stars, or Seven-out-of-ten."
504,Adaptation.,6,5 November 2014,Funny in places but not actually that clever,"Charlie Kaufman wrote the delirious comedy 'Being John Malkovich', in which the eponymous title role was played by none other than John Malkovich himself. In 'Adaptation', the central character is one Charlie Kaufman, and the opening scene is actually supposedly filmed on the set of the earlier film (although Kaufman does not attempt to act, and Nicolas Cage plays him instead). But in fact 'Adaptation' is not quite as tricky and clever as the earlier film: it is in fact a fairly conventional story of a blocked writer finding himself by engaging with the subject he's supposed to be writing about. Forget that the character is at some level modelled on the author, and it's fairly conventional (and unbelievable) stuff. Part of the problem here is that Kaufman writes himself as an inadequate loser, which seems overdone given that he was, as he was actually writing this script, one of the world's most famous scriptwriters; while the characters in the story he's supposed to be writing are thin and unconvincing. It's not all bad: the exchanges he gives his alter ego with his brother, Dan (who is spite of being fictional is also credited with contributing to the real script, but who in the story is also played by Cage, and attempting to make it as a screenwriter himself turning out formulaic rubbish with an astonishing lack of self-awareness) are hilarious. But overall, there's less here than meets the eye. Kaufman might even have done better to play it straight instead of trying to follow the delightfully bizarre foray of his earlier film."
505,Adaptation.,8,19 October 2012,"Not rules, *principles*","Charlie(the neurotic one) and Donald(the careless one) Kaufman are twin brother screenwriters(both played to perfection by Cage... he really makes the two distinctly different), the former trying to adapt The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean(Streep, spot-on, as always, as a New Yorker writer who, though she'll barely admit to it, feels trapped in her situation) about John Laroche(Cooper, who steals the show as an arrogant, sweet, and eccentric(...and when someone uses that word about just one character in a movie by this writer, you know they really are out there), guy who, well, he steals the flowers, in the Florida swamps), and we get into all three stories, and explore the relationship between artist and subject, and the creative process in an engaging manner(and the potential difficulty of writing) - anyone who's tried to author a project will recognize a lot. The acting is great for all concerned. It's quite clever and immensely funny, in a somewhat off-beat kind of way. The ""meta"" is compelling, with the three narratives affecting each other, with the potential for slipping into the esoteric handled with sudden, out-of-nowhere jokes(some of them self-referential) or the like. There is a moderate amount of strong language, a bit of disturbing and/or brutal, violent content, and a little sexuality and nudity(male, and topless female) in this. I recommend this to any fan of the director and writer. 8/10"
506,Adaptation.,,20 November 2011,it's not great and doesn't make much sense,"I usually watch Meryl Streep movies and Nic Cage movies too because they don't do rubbish that often but in this case I think they dropped the ball. With all the nominations and good reviews, thought this would be good but I found it a strange combination which didn't make much sense.At first it starts like a indie comedy about an eccentric screenplay writer and his creative process and romantic fantasy life. It's quite interesting looking at the subject, author and screenplay writer in turns.Then it becomes a silly action thriller and it just doesn't add up. Meryl Streep's behavior in this part doesn't make sense suddenly wanting to kill Nic just because he knows she and Chris Cooper's character are having an affair and using orchids for drugs.Maybe I didn't get how the two different parts. Didn't like the ending at all - a waste of time."
507,Adaptation.,3,25 April 2010,showing its age,"This movie hasn't aged well. I appreciate Chris Cooper's turn as the orchid thief, but the plot is as stale as an old music video. The creative process of show biz kids is boring and tedious to start with, and this makes up 2/3 of the movie. The last 1/3 is tacked-on action, gratuitous violence and special effects. It's a junk pile of clichés using alligators, 30-06's, unusual orchid-based drugs, split personalities, internet porn, etc. The beginning of this old Hollywood video closeout VHS tape contained trailers for 2002-2003 films similar to Adaptation which have fared even worse with age. I couldn't remember a single one of them being in a theater. They could just as well been minor films from 1986, or 1950. Given enough time maybe TMC will be able to revive them. Good luck."
508,Adaptation.,8,13 December 2009,"Adaptation is the rare film that both attacks and revels in the humbling, soul-crushing yet exhilarating mechanics of Hollywood movie-making.","Spellbindingly original, like the wild orchid, Adaptation is a marvel of adaptation, entwined with its hot house entertainment and yet stunningly unique. The story is about a depressive screenwriter (Nicolas Cage) who has difficulty adapting a non-fiction book about orchids, while his dunce of a brother works on a gimmicky serial-killer movie.Adaptation is an impressively deft comedy about writer's block, hardly an inherently cinematic subject; the obsessive self-referentiality is rewarding and revealing, and the performances wonderful, though the deliberately clunky final act will strike some as a clever conceit too far. Adaptation received positive reviews and critical acclaim, as well as outstanding success at the 75th Academy Awards, 60th Golden Globe Awards and 56th British Academy Film Awards."
509,Adaptation.,5,21 September 2009,"commendably bold and daring, but sadly lacking and uninteresting","If I can commend ""Adaptation."" for anything at all, it is the fact that in an era where most of Hollywood's products are repetitive, tiresome, mundane, and hackneyed, it makes a noble effort at being daring and fresh. However, film history is full of films that were daring and fresh and were still not all that recommendable. Here is a film that is bold, original, well-acted, and yet I was thoroughly bored. Why? Mostly because it overplayed its hand too much too many times.Obviously, this film is a comedy because its plot is too ridiculous and harebrained to be taken seriously, even though the movie does tend to go in a solemn direction. Nicolas Cage has a dual role, playing the screenwriter of the movie, Charlie Kaufman, and his brother Donald (who in real life is imaginary). Kaufman is a troubled, lovelorn screenwriter who wants to adapt a book written by a nonfiction author (Meryl Streep) and because ""it's about flowers"" as he so eloquently puts it. Meanwhile, his brother scores with a brilliant first screenplay of his own and as Charlie fantasizes about romantic adventures with various women, the author begins a peculiar relationship with a rabid plant collector played brilliantly by Chris Cooper.Yeah, to even try to make a movie with this kind of a plot in the 21st century is daring and I commend the filmmakers for this move. But in the end, I cannot give ""Adaptation."" a sincere approval. Like I stated earlier, the movie overplays it unique hand quite a bit and this is partially due to the screenplay, which is very pompous and verbose and very disorganized with flashbacks and zooming-back-to-the-present motions that really becomes confusing after a while. Some of the dialogue, which was meant to be comical and amusing, seemed very bombastic and overblown to me. And probably the biggest error was that the movie was trying to blend a serious flat-out drama and a lighthearted comedy into one big ball when it's not very good at being either in their individual moments and in the end, ""Adaptation."" really comes across as if it's confusing itself as to what it's supposed to be. It has an identity crisis.And the characterswhile all brilliantly portrayed by a great cast of actorsthere was not onenot onethat had me interested. Nicolas Cage is brilliant in his dual role, but sometimes the lovelorn Charlie is too sappy and sometimes embarrassing to watch such as his repetitive erotic dreams and the independent Donald just too wacky and off-kilter to find funny. I like Meryl Streep a lot, but her character just did not seem to have a purpose. The only character I found holding my attention for any stretch of time was the one played by Chris Cooper, who won an Oscar for this movie. But after a while I was getting bored with him, too.It almost breaks my heart when I have to pan a movie that tries to be bold in today's cinema realm, but this time I have to. ""Adaptation."" is a generally well-received movie. A lot of people describe it as brilliant, but I guess there are just some whose bells it will not ring. Mine were not tolling. They just hung empty, wanting to be played by a movie that really could have been a winner."
510,Adaptation.,5,16 February 2009,Adaptation is a letdown!,"Spike Jones's Adaptation entertains big time, but its dry, abrupt and weak climax leaves the viewer disappointed all the way. The story itself is twisted and unimaginable. Performance-Wise: Chris Cooper won the Oscar for best supporting actor, and he deserved it. Nicolas Cage is astounding as Charlie and Donald. Note the scene where a mentally finished Charlie calls up his mom to say that his twin brother has died. That scene proves it all. Meryl Streep surprisingly isn't that great. She only impresses in the first few scenes. Brian Cox plays legendary screenplay writer 'Robert Mckee'to the hilt. On the whole, 'Adaptation' has it pluses, but its minuses are undeniable."
511,Adaptation.,3,25 September 2008,:sleeping-typing:,"Oh, Nickie Nickie... Way to pull of such an amazing portrayal of such a pathetic looser. Somehow I think it comes naturally. This movie is incredibly boring on a new level. And Meryl Streep. Quick question: Do you read a lot of romance novels? And your voice... What a lullaby. Seriously, it put me to sleep. In fact, I think I'll buy this movie, just so I can get to sleep at night. And I'll wake up in the middle of the night with the audio of the movie's climax ringing in my ears, reminding me to turn it off.Although, Chris Cooper stood Nick Cage up in this movie, That was good... up until the GIGANTICALLY RIDICULOUS ENDING."
512,Adaptation.,4,1 July 2008,Not as satisfying as promised,"After reading many reviews about the inspirational and philosophical plot of this film, I was not completely satisfied. Yes, it does feature a few philosophical quotes which I think were quite nice, but that does not make the film philosophical. The acting by Nicolas Cage is the same as in every other movie, the self-pitying has-been or run down character that I do get tired of seeing. I also believe a few scenes (which I will not mention so as to not spoil the story) destroy what could have been a nice film. Aside from criticism, the film was intelligent, but I fail to see how a film can be rated as spectacular simply because it contains a few smart lines."
513,Adaptation.,9,1 June 2007,The tragicomic living of Charlie Kaufman,"The movie starts from the set of Being John Malkovich (1999), a very fine movie that Charlie Kaufman wrote.Now Kaufman has to write a script of Susan Orlean's book The Orchid Thief, a book about orchids.It's not the easiest job in the world since the book is non-fiction.So this movie tells about the writer's block.Eventually Charlie writes himself in the movie.He also has a twin brother who has no difficulties to write a movie.Spike Jonze is the director of Adaptation (2002).It's an eccentric movie, and a very good one.Kaufman is not the most traditional writer in the world.Nicolas Cage is perfect in his role playing Kaufman and his twin brother.Meryl Streep was a fine choice for the part of Susan Orlean.Chris Cooper does very good job as John Laroche.This movie is often funny, often sad.What happens at the end of the movie is something very unexpected.As is everything else in the movie."
514,Adaptation.,10,27 May 2007,A stroke of genius,"This film, for want of a better word, is genius.First the performances from the leads are just spectacular. And there's the script.Complaints about the ending do not rub well with me. He can't finish his script, he's a failure, he has to go to classes his brother sends him to. SOmething Charlie sees as repulsive. But HE has a character ark there...something which he didn't want to portray in his film. His character ark was discovering that his film Adaptation had to have a character ark: much like Susan saw that her passion was to be passionate about something.As soon as Donald, his brother, gets involved in the script (a man who writes cliché thrillers)...the film turns into just that. It does everything Charlie didn't want to happen: drugs, guns, death, profound moments of love.This is why this film stands so high in my most cherished films. Plus...what's used more in films than detective thrillers? Split personalities...;) Perfect film...so much to think about, so many hidden contradictions and ironies. Just one to watch closely more than once, and again...you'll find more than you'd think possibly in a film."
515,Adaptation.,9,1 May 2007,A really fresh movie,"This movie is something else. One of the cleverest movies I've seen in a long time with a ending, some people see as misplaced,i think is perfect. The film develops exactly like the screen ""guru"" advices to Donald and Charlie. So the majority of the movie is Charlie writing about people who don't always have exciting lives who's lives don't change and the ending is written by his fictitious brother Donald who believes everything the Screen ""guru"" tells about Hollywood so near the end it develops into an almost detective thriller with drugs, sex, violence and a car chase scene. Even ending with a happy ending but thats the point of it the last part is supposed to be a deliberate hollywoodisation of the book where characters are distorted events are made up all in aid of making things more exciting. The movie gives you the typical Hollywood arc of a man with troubles who overcomes them and gets the girl in the end. If anything this movie shows perfectly the contrast between what is real and what is Hollywood and for this I stand up and applaud Mr. Kaufman for a real gem of a movie."
516,Adaptation.,8,22 April 2007,undeniably clever but sometimes too slow,"Well the obvious things to like about ""Adaptation"" are the really complex characters and the great acting. Especially the acting of Nicolas Cage, who plays both the frustrated Charlie Kaufmann and his brother, who is full of the joys of life, amazed me. Although the twins look exactly the same, you are always able to distinguish between the two on the first sight. But if you fully let yourself get involved in the film and look behind the obvious positive aspects (mentioned above), you will find some ideas unique to the history of film. In my opinion you have ""a film within a film"" in this story (maybe this does not perfectly hit the nail on the head, but i will try to explain it). Of course everything is based around Charlie Kaufmann and his way of dealing with his life and job. That is the main plot, which sounds like nothing special compared to other films. But while the film develops, Charlie's life turns more and more into an unrealistic ""Hollywood movie"" of the kind that Charlie, as a screenwriter, tries to avoid composing. The whole movie deals with Charlie's ambitions to create a screenplay devoid of the old ""Hollywood"" stereotypes in which the characters succeed and one unrealistic event follows the other. He says that he wants to write a screenplay in which ""nothing much changes"", like in real life. But finally he is the one who succeeds and develops in personality. Further more, he is confronted with a chain of unrealistic events, and as his life mutates into a parody of Hollywood films, the viewer is more and more able to find little hints referring to other famous movies. Ironically, the life of Charlie turns into a Hollywood film itself --> ""a film in the film"".OK all this sounds quite cool but why only an 8? Well although you have a really original idea behind this movie and a protagonist you can easily identify with, you sometimes feel like the movie is a bit slow... maybe this is necessary, not only to demonstrate Charlie's problems in dealing with a ""real life"" screenplay, but also to make the turning point of the movie more powerful.But anyway i recommend it for nearly everyone."
517,Adaptation.,10,18 April 2007,Self-referential absurdity,"Despite the slew of recent book-to-film adaptations, it is admittedly a difficult task bringing to screen something that's by nature a completely different medium. And while there has been no shortage of exceptional films that originated from within the confines of a novel or short story, it takes a truly gifted screenwriter to come up with a translation that manages to be daringly original. Fortunately, when you use the word 'original', the name Charlie Kaufman won't be far behind. The visionary screenwriter behind such cult hits like 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', Kaufman is no stranger to metafiction - that loopy film genre where the boundaries of reality and fiction are blurred so self-referentially that it actually makes you feel smarter just watching it. While attempting to adapt the Susan Orlean book 'The Orchid Thief' for the big screen, Kaufman runs into a minor obstacle: the book is devoid of any hint of a plot. So what does he do? He writes a story about himself - an overweight balding screenwriter named Charlie Kaufman (played to perfection by Nicolas Cage) who is trying to adapt 'The Orchid Thief' for the big screen. Things are not aided by the fact that Kaufman's twin brother Donald is also a fledging writer trying to write the screenplay for a big-budget psychological thriller called 'The 3'. It is a testament to Cage's performance that despite wearing the same fat suit while playing both brothers, his facial expressions are enough for you to distinguish between the brothers on screen. The film then delves into a heady mix of inspired lunacy, as Kaufman meets the book's author, played by Meryl Streep, who then recounts meeting the book's subject, a Florida orchid grower played by Chris Cooper in his Oscar-winning role. As Charlie slowly loses his control over the screenplay while realizing the book is un-filmable, he starts getting advice from Donald, who suggests adding a love story, some drug use, some guns and a car chase. The genius of 'Adaptation' lies in the fact that after Donald 'Hollywood-ises' Charlie's screenplay, the movie itself turns into the very thing he wants it to be. The film is peppered with several ironic moments, such as the appearance by screen writing guru Robert McGee (played by Brian Cox) who decries the use of a voice-over narration at the very same time that the angsty Charlie is spouting off a narration in his head. It is truly difficult to do the film justice in a straightforward film review like this. Its amorphous plot could only be enjoyed by watching the film itself, and enjoying it as it takes you on a journey to the most unexpected places. While meta-fiction has existed in films as old as Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and as recent as Michael Winterbottom's delightfully quirky 'Tristam Shandy', few filmmakers attempt it for the sheer convolution of its structure. But when you are in the hands of a genre-master like Kaufman, all you can do is scratch your head, squeal in delight, and enjoy the ride."
518,Adaptation.,7,28 March 2007,The resolution was a cop out.,"I agree with other that the resolution of the movie was a cop out. If the screenwriter was ridiculing the cheesiness of plot-driven movies, then he became the object of his own ridicule. I think he could have easily come up with a more meaningful ending.Another disappointment was that the movie wasn't filmed on location in the actual Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. Anyone who hasn't been in the preserve and seen its beauty must have wondered what the fuss was all about. The Fakahatchee is a second growth cypress swamp with incredible plant life including bromeliads and the less obvious orchids.I visited the swamp for years before I even saw the first orchid. The only on site filming occurred in the initial scene of the preserve when the van was turning in to the preserve from the highway, a three second shot. For some reason the director didn't think the movie was worth shooting on location."
519,Adaptation.,8,24 March 2007,Adapting to the Demands of the Marketplace,"Screen writing must be a schizophrenic process for the creative artist. On the one hand, the writer desires to create an original work of art (""Charlie""); on the other hand, the writer wants audiences to enjoy his work (""Donald""). Real-life screen writing guru Robert McKee, Kaufman's adversary/mentor, writes in his book, ""Story,"" that there simply isn't much of an audience for films that stray too far from the conventional, three-act story form (""archplot""). So, should the writer remain faithful to his artistic impulse or adapt himself to the demands of the marketplace? The film's title, ""Adaptation,"" refers to the fatalistic choices forced upon creative artists by a commercial entertainment industry, I think, as much as it refers literally to the translation of a non-fiction work into a film. ""Charlie Kaufman"" accepts the assignment of adapting ""The Orchid Thief,"" an unfilmable story, suffering anxiety and depression as a consequence of his seemingly impossible task. At the same time, his brother/alter ego, ""Donald,"" enjoys success by producing a crass, formulaic, and commercially appealing screenplay that slavishly follows McKee's precepts. In his frustration, ""Charlie"" succumbs to the pressures of the marketplace and reworks ""Orchid Thief"" into a standard, Hollywood, guns-drugs-sex-cars exploitation flick.The film's finale is predictably absurd, but ""Charlie"" Kaufman permits himself one final artistic conceit: He kills off ""Donald."" What should we make of the death of Charlie's ""brother/alter ego?"" Is Charlie Kaufman arguing that submission to the commercial demands of Hollywood means the death of the artist? Or, is Charlie Kaufman making a more personal statement, that he is finished trying to satisfy the crass tastes of the industry and movie going public?"
520,Adaptation.,8,8 March 2007,"Just an amazingly done film, and am amazing screenplay.","Adaptation. is an amazingly done film. The acting is superb, the directing was also amazing. The screenplay was a genius idea. I loved this film, and didn't see many areas possible for improvement. Nicholas cage's acting in this is defiantly at his prime. I have seen this film three times, and it still hasn't lost its effect. The acting is so good, that the opening monologue done by cage just makes you smile. Cris Cooper plays his role so good its scary. This film contains some of the best acting i have ever seen, and thats good because i work at Blockbuster. I would HIGHLY recommend this film to and true film lover. If you watch movies just for action or to pass time, then this just simply isn't for you. Worth buying to me, a true piece of gold in my book. I gave this an 8 out of ten, i don't see this being rated and lower for what it is, the only reason its below an 8 on average is because people rate film based of what they like, not if it was good or not (in mu opinion). SEE THIS FILM."
521,Adaptation.,7,7 February 2007,Interesting critique of the creative process,"""Adaptation"" has come under fire for depicting Kaufman's somewhat less than stellar creative and personal integrity. However, thats the entire point of the movie. As a writer myself, I approached this film with a full understanding of just how difficult it can be to synthesize new material and then nurture it to financial fruition. The world that Kaufman occupies is that of the creative professional struggling to make the necessary concessions to convention while retaining originality. This phenomena is by no means particular to film, and this is where Cage's delicate rendering of Kaufman's character reveals just how personal the hits can be when things go south.At its worst, ""Adaptation"" can drag in moments of self pity, but at its best, it has more to say about human nature and interaction than most films being produced today. The significance lies not in that Kaufman is a screenwriter, but in that his struggles are ubiquitous and common to us all. Getting hung up on the technical, film production side of this movie is a mistake; you'll miss everything it has to say."
522,Adaptation.,3,22 January 2007,Another tryhard failure from the dream machine,"No, no, no, one thousand times NO! This film got sillier as it progressed. All credit to American directors that make an attempt at being a bit artsy, a bit different, but often this comes out as a film that has an interesting beginning, sort of engages me, but then goes for the lamest of random elements and ends up ridiculous (cf. 'Magnolia' - wtf have frogs got to do with it!?, 'Girl Interrupted' - Jolie was great, interesting, powerful, rebellious but then the lame little Winona character comes out of nowhere, heroic - barf, and yes kids, I'm gonna say it, 'Fight Club', again, started out a very interesting film then got very corny and predictable). I think this downward trend is possibly the result of such big money ventures as the modern feature-film having too many stake-holders to appease, too many barrows being pushed - can't get our financiers off side can we now. LET THE DIRECTOR DO HIS/HER THING, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE PAID TO DO!"
523,Adaptation.,9,14 January 2007,The Book,"Have any of you read the book? The Orchid Thief? I wonder, if the quotes that supposedly had come from the book, really is from the book? Cause if they are, I'd love to read the book... Please give me a private message if you know something about it. I would be very grateful;)I loved the movie by the way, probably because of all the very good quotes... Movies today, usually lets the action talk for itself, but I love it when movies contain good quotes...The actors did a perfect job, and Nicholas Cage is also performing very well( as usually);)Quotes make the world go around..."
524,Adaptation.,2,5 November 2006,spoilt by murder,"The move had been okay (comprising some intelligence as had been expected) until the murder scenes appeared. They which made the movie a typical American one in a sense that the only radical and unpredictable scenes make a film complete and of interest. Therefore I would not classify the film as an intellectual one or being of such a kind but rather as an ordinary commercial movie targeted at making as much impress, by making unexpected turns, as possible. On the other hand, the actors perform very well. Thus who enjoys seeing her/his beloved actors should see it. I loved Meryl Streep acting as a book author who hinds her real habits from the world and does everything to protect this secrets."
525,Adaptation.,8,29 April 2006,two (or three or four) for the price of one,"There was once a time when the only movies that got any kind of recognition were overblown Hollywood productions. A number of the movies that came out in the last two or three months of 2002 showed that era to be completely defunct. One of these low-key, semi-indie flicks was the perplexing - but very well done - ""Adaptation."" The movie starts with the filming of ""Being John Malkovich"". Most of the cast and crew are all doing their usual stuff. Except for one person: Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage). Now that he has written his masterpiece, he's worried that his career can only go down from here. It doesn't help that his twin brother Donald (also Cage) takes a less than serious approach to life.Anyway, Charlie is approached to adapt into a screenplay Susan Orlean's (Meryl Streep) novel ""The Orchid Thief"", about yokel John Laroche (Chris Cooper) stealing flowers from the Florida jungle. Unfortunately, nothing really happens in this novel, so Kaufman can't adapt it...unless he writes himself into the story.That's when Charlie and Donald decide to see whether they can meet Ms. Orlean. What they don't know is that she's gotten even more infatuated with her subject than Truman Capote ever got! And this could have some rather unpleasant outcomes.OK, so this movie isn't really any kind of masterpiece, but it's definitely worth seeing as a look into the tensed-up lives of writers, and the proliferation of certain affairs. It's weird to think that the real-life Kaufman wrote himself into the story just like the one portrayed does (not to mention that Orlean and Laroche are real people). All in all, it's a pretty interesting movie. It might just turn you into a plant lover. Also starring Tilda Swinton, Brian Cox and Maggie Gyllenhaal."
526,Adaptation.,,31 January 2006,Another Jonze/Kaufman House of Mirrors,"The Spike Jonze/Charlie Kaufman opus Adaptation begins with a reference to the previous Jonze/Kaufman opus Being John Malkovich: We're on the set of BJM, and there's Kaufman (played by Nicolas Cage) looking lost and miserable, and there's John Cusack acting like Charlie isn't alive, and Catherine Keener not giving Charlie the time of day, and John Malkovich himself saying something pithy and Malkovichian. What we're meant to think, of course, is how hip it is to start a movie with a reference to your last movie; and later when we're introduced to Kaufman's creative woes we're meant to think how Felliniesque it is to write a script about yourself writing a script (at least Fellini waited until his eighth-and-a-half film to descend completely into self-reference and -reverence). And still later, when Kaufman openly admits being narcissistic and self-indulgent, we're supposed to give him points for honesty, as if this pre-emptive apology excused him from being narcissistic and self-indulgent. Pardon me if I seem less-than-impressed.I wasn't impressed by Being John Malkovich either; it struck me as affected and aimless, a stunt propped up by dashes of sincerity. I appreciated the movie's dry sense of humor, and Catherine Keener's devastating portrayal of a sarcastic super-witch, but I thought there was too much knowing self-effacement in the way Kaufman and Jonze deconstructed the modern male (i.e. themselves). The self-deprecation is even more pungent in Adaptation; Nicolas Cage's Charlie Kaufman is an overweight, balding forty-year-old who sweats profusely in the presence of women, and Kaufman the writer misses few opportunities to humiliate Kaufman the character, to complain about what miserable wretches both are. Furthering the solipsistic agenda, Kaufman includes the fictional character of his brother Donald, also played by Cage, who is Charlie's diametric opposite, a self-assured ladies'-man with a sense of humor about himself. Donald begins working on his own screenplay, and to Charlie's dismay shows a proficiency for the kind of commercial writing Charlie himself pretends to despise but is actually envious of. This gives Kaufman an excuse to lecture us; Donald becomes the means by which he criticizes the small-mindedness of Hollywood producers, agents, etc., His portrayal of Donald is affectionate though, and he can't bring himself to take a real artistic stand. Charlie Kaufman, the wishy-washy genius.Kaufman and Jonze are fascinated with the absurdity of being a man; in BJM they eviscerated John Cusack's character, portrayed Malkovich as a sex-crazed egomaniac, and concluded that the only solution for Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz was to become lesbians. In Adaptation they try branching out a little by including a female character who's as screwed-up as the men. Her name is Sue Orlean, the New Yorker writer whose book Charlie is torturing himself trying to adapt, and she's played by Meryl Streep as a dissatisfied intellectual taken in by the charms of the dirt-bag professional flower-thief who's the subject of her best-selling tome. Charlie falls in love with Sue through her book, and Sue leaves her ineffectual husband for Laroche the flower-man who shows her the secret to happiness (hint: you snort it). The story-within-a-story structure is pleasingly unique for awhile, but it quickly becomes apparent that Charlie Kaufman has no idea how to satisfactorily resolve his loopy, house-of-mirrors narrative. Kaufman is great at setting up weird situations but terrible at following through on them. The novelty of BJM wore off about an hour in, and the novelty of Adaptation lasts only slightly longer. What makes Adaptation a little more successful is Nicolas Cage's engaging portrayal of Charlie and Donald Kaufman, the yin-and-yang screenwriters.It's been so long since Cage had a role that was of interest to anyone but his accountants that one could be forgiven for forgetting how terrific he can be. Cage plays Charlie Kaufman as a lovable screw-up, a brainy nice-guy who's defeated by his complete lack of belief in himself. Charlie has principles but doesn't have the nerve to stand up for them, and he's unassertive around women which leads to loneliness. Cage gives Charlie the quality of an awkward teenager; he keeps embarrassing himself, miscalculating, holding back at the wrong moments. Charlie is a grown-up gawky adolescent; and Donald is a grown-up adolescent Don Juan. Cage plays Donald and Charlie fairly close together, but gives Donald looser body-language and a less discombobulated way of expressing himself. The combination of brotherly affection and competitiveness is well-developed by the writing, and Cage does an uncanny job delineating both sides of the relationship. He accomplishes the same thing Malkovich accomplished in BJM - he takes a stunt and makes it into something.I've barely said a word about Spike Jonze, Meryl Streep or Chris Cooper, the last of whom won a gold statue of some kind for playing the dentally-challenged orchid-man Laroche. This is a terrible oversight in the case of Cooper, who is entertaining and deserves a purple heart for having his front teeth removed. As for Streep I have little to say; I still can't find a trace of personality in her acting, and I found her portrayal of Sue Orlean mannered and slightly off-key (the real Sue Orlean is probably flattered to have been played by Meryl Streep, but given the cold, unpleasant quality Streep projects, I'm not sure she should be). And on the subject of Spike Jonze I find myself almost equally stumped for words. Jonze has impeccable camera technique, but he seems too willing to sink into the woodwork. There's something introverted about his directing; he lacks the boldness of a real cinematic artist, and this is why his movies seem so concept-driven. Jonze and Kaufman are sneaky-smart hype-artists more than filmmakers; they've succeeded in constructing a wall of myth around themselves by pulling stunts like putting real people into their movies, or co-crediting their scripts to non-existent siblings. Adaptation has a lot going on in it and around it, but doesn't add up to very much at all."
527,Adaptation.,10,24 December 2005,"Fresh, Original... mind twisting...","This has been my favourite movie for three years now. It made me stand up and recognize Kaufman, whose movies I had seen, but not known who he was. That in itself is the very essence of this movie. The irony of this movie making me recognize Kaufman, who admits he shouldn't be a character because it is self-serving... well, that is only one of the many examples of a cleverly developed cycle that won't ever let your mind go if you keep thinking about this movie. Cage, although often criticized for being type cast in a middle age ""loser"" role, plays the part well. If one hasn't seen him in any of the other movies, then it isn't a problem either. However, it could be a drawback, if one were tired of seeing Cage play that role, of the viewing experience. Nevertheless, the movie itself is not flawed by Cage. I need not mention the exceptional quality of Cooper and Streep. At one point, Cooper's character says ""I think I should play me""... a friend of mine thought that was actually him in the movie playing himself in the movie."
528,Adaptation.,10,10 December 2005,Groundbreaking Screenplay,"What i have come to appreciate about ADAPTATION is that the many levels on which it works are all so deeply investigated. there is very little experimentation that does not go through the full exhaustion of its possibilities. Charlie Kaufman, genius, has one great attribute in addition to his mental facility: he is not lazy. many screenwriters give us a taste, a hint and want the applause without pushing their ideas, their characters and their narratives through to fruition. Charlie does. He presents so many new possibilities - dual screenwriters, identical twins, characters who shift from sympathetic to villainous - and arrives at entertaining conclusions that are as provocative as they are satisfying."
529,Adaptation.,5,7 December 2005,Beautifully enlightening and surprising,"""ADAPTATION"" is a Drama with shocking bit of horror that was never to be expected out of such a ""nice"" movie. Wonderfully entertaining. Some dull spots which made me wonder what was next.As John Loroche is assigned to adapting a novel of orchids into a screenplay, he struggles with the mutable subject of flowers. In search of how to make such a novel into a faithfully adapted and well written screenplay, as close to the novel as possible, John begins his quest to find out more about the author in hopes to enlighten his script. He finds himself doing the number one thing he didn't want to and writes himself in the script. Which turns to be a tremendous leap and well written plot. Not only is this film dramatic, but educationally and entertainingly documentary .Through his research of the novelist, he interpretively adapts what he thinks to be the most important details of the novel; Her life, her passions, her risks, the endangered Ghost Orchid, and why it is so sought after.The beginning, middle, and end is my favorite parts, as should be. I loved the beginning where it vividly shows insects pollinating orchids. It was educational to learn that the insects find the orchid which looks most like themselves physically, as if one of a kind, adapts to the flower in a dance while pollinating the flower. The visual adaptation was beautifully captured and enlightening! Truly a believable and faithful adaptation!"
530,Adaptation.,10,25 November 2005,Brilliant,"Only read this review if you didn't get it.Normally I hate self-referential stories. I hate the way self-reference brings you out of the story instead of drawing you in. So you would think that an entirely self-referential movie would be hell for me. Well it wasn't.The weird thing about Adaptation is that although it is totally self-referential it manages to to draw you into the story.You have the story of the adaptation of The Orchid Thief and the The Orchid Thief story itself running side by side, it chops and changes between them. You can think of the story of the adaptation as being ""real life"" and the adaptation story as being fiction or vice versa. Of course both thread of these stories have some element of truth.Then at the end both the stories merge and it becomes everything that the screenwriter wanted the adaptation of the Orchid Thief not to be. Then of course you realise that you have been sucked in complete and that the boundaries of truth and fiction have been blurred. The best example is bringing to life the fictional brother of Charlie Kaufman: Donald.The film comments on personal passions, approaches to life and approaches to writing. It comments on rules you should follow when writing and then paradoxically both breaks them and follows them at the same time.It isn't as laugh out loud funny as Being John Malkovich but that's okay. This film may be billed as a comedy but I think it is bigger than that. While making fun of the process of adapting the Orchid Thief it manages to fit in some beautiful quotes from that book. You also see the screenwriters reaction to the book he is supposed to be adapting. The question is how much of the the screenwriters part in the movie is fiction and how much is fact. That is ultimately what messes with your head. I will need to see this film again, the genius of this film is that is so clever that it appear not to be clever but the more you think about it the more clever it becomes."
531,Adaptation.,7,25 November 2005,An entertaining film...,"Adaptation is a story about a screenwriter trying to write a movie from a book called ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan Orlean (played brilliantly by the magnificent Meryl Streep). It shows Charlie Kaufman (the real screenwriter for the movie, played by Nicolas Cage) and his twin brother Donald (although he is made up, played by Nicolas Cage!) trying to make a script for a film from a ""mediocre book"". It also shows Orlean writing the book and trying to get ideas from a man named John Laroche (played, in an Oscar winning role, by Chris Cooper). All up, Adaptation is an entertaining film that was worth the $5.50 that I payed to rent it out."
532,Adaptation.,8,14 October 2005,Indecision,"I must admit this film is most perplexing, and still most entertaining. A winding narrative driven by good performances and story of great imagination.""I don't want to cram in sex or guns or car chases or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end."" - Well for most you would probably assume such a film would be boring and not worthy of IMDb's top 250.Maybe so, this film asserts this, and then uses narrative to blast such a theory out of the water. Whose theory? Charlie Kaufman.Nicholas Cage is Kaufman. A reclusive, nervous, mixed-up screenwriter, and ironically the name of the films real-life writer. He face frustration and anxiety when trying to write up a new original film, with the added barrier of a massive, exhaustive writer's block.With the concept of turning the novel of a prominent author (Meryl Streep) into a movie, this film focuses on his dance with his own inner demons, and his own excruciating inability to get to work. The orchid thief being the title of the piece, that is proving hard to write. He needs inspiration.Help? Well it doesn't come so readily. Donald Kaufman - his twin brother, also played by Cage - is an upbeat extrovert of whom Charlie belittles as a wannabe? But it isn't him getting the rough end of the writer's job. And with this he seeks the help of the writer, who turns out to be anything but boring. An adulterous woman, seeking the love of an obsessed orchid cultivator, played with Oscar winning prowess by Chris Cooper.He even goes to a screen writing lecture. Headed by the marvelous Brian Cox, who strongly attests Charlie's idea about how life really is. As stated in speech marks above - somewhere ^And so with the frustration, the angst and this in mind Charlie sets out to discover what the world is like, what lives are undertaken, and what thrills await. And he finds them, with ironic realism. The car chases, the gun fights, the sex, the drug abuse, the scandal.If you have an open mind you might accept the ingenuity of this picture, it is clever, cunning, and although slow, it is quite mesmerising at the same time. And worthy of a second viewing or more.From the director/writer team behind the equally as odd, and confusing Being John Malkovich it is a rewarding film, and deserves good recognition."
533,Adaptation.,9,20 September 2005,Very Unique Movie,"ADAPTATION is a very unique movie in that it has essentially several stories in one. Also, it is a combination of real characters and fictional characters in one as well as using real life situations that involved them. First, we have Nicolas Cage who actually plays two brothers: Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman of whom the latter one is fictional. Both of them are writers. Meryl Streep plays Susan Orlean, a writer for the NEW YORKER. Lastly, Chris Cooper plays John Laroche, an orchid hunter in the Everglades.For those who have not seen the movie, this is the basic premise: The movie starts with the filming of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, which was directed by the same director as this movie: Spike Jonez. At any rate, Charlie Kaufman is a script writer who is assigned to write a screen play out of ""The Orhard Thief"" of which was written by Susan Orlean. However, Charlie is struggling to adapt the screenplay, which is not helped by the fact that his brother Donald has no trouble with his writing of car chases. Meanwhile, Susan Orlean is sent on assignment to interview John Larroche and write about the orchids. This leads to an obsession for all the different characters as they struggle in their own unique way. Susan and John end up in a relationship together. Meanwhile, Charlie is obsessed by Susan although he is afraid to meet with her when an opportunity arises. He attends a script writing lecture in New York and afterward, he writes himself into his script. Through all this, the movie inter-cuts between several situations among the different characters I mentioned until we come to a wild shootout. In the end, Charlie finishes writing his screen play and has regained his confidence. While I may not have explained the premise real well, this is essentially what happens. Watching the film, I kept wondering how things would work out and everything seems to fit together at the end. I personally own the film on DVD and would recommend it to others."
534,Adaptation.,6,5 April 2005,intriguing but ultimately disappointing,"During the first 2/3rds of this movie, I was waiting till the end to say to my husband ""I told you so"" He had not wanted to see it when it came out and I really did. Last night we watched it on DVD and what I viewed as a straightforward trajectory veered off when Charlie got into the elevator in NYC. It never got back on track. Yes, Charlie was in a way always kind of annoying with his endless internal self pitying dialogues, but they are dialogues I imagine most of us play somewhat in our heads. I found this a movie filled with love, pathos, betrayal, (self pity), frustration, real interest. Who knew so much about orchids? Love between the brothers, Susan for the orchid thief (God, can't remember his name!) love between Charlie and Amelia. the orchid thief's love for his family. Betrayal when Susan is making fun of the orchid thief with her husband and friends in denial of her feelings and his innate dignity. Once Charlie still couldn't get over his fear and speak to Susan in the elevator the movie lost me, the trip to Florida, following (was it Mike?) and Susan, their reaction, esp Susan's; yet another car accident, the alligator; none of it seemed a piece with what had come before. An earlier reviewer had said that Charlie made just the kind of movie he wanted to make; one that would not be successful. Well as a viewer I am more interested in the kind of movie I want to see, rather than one deliberately subverted."
535,Adaptation.,8,15 March 2005,Great actors,"I won't try to write an in-depth review of this movie, as others have already done a better job than I could, and I kind of doubt anyone reads beyond the first few reviews anyway! However, I did want to comment on a few things. Nicolas Cage is superb. I haven't been a fan of his and thought he wasn't a very good actor, suspected that he got where he has because he is Coppola's nephew. Leaving Las Vegas began to change my mind, he was so good in that, and now with Adaptation I am truly impressed. A lot of actors and actresses aren't very good when they first start out, but they improve greatly over time. Chris Cooper is also excellent. I did not even recognize him from Sea Biscuit, October Sky, or American Beauty. Although his roles in American Beauty and October Sky were very similar (he played a very strict father), his other roles have been very different. The guy is diverse."
536,Adaptation.,10,28 February 2005,"Stupid, Fat, Bald, Ugly...Beautiful Movie","So I'm writing this review of the Spike Jonze/Charlie Kaufman film, Adaptation, and I'm thinking that I'll make the review self-referential. ""Isn't that a neat trick?"" I'm thinking, even as I'm also thinking of writing ""'Isn't that a neat trick?' I'm thinking."" (Breathe now)...This is a level of art rarely seen in film. It manages to surrealistically explore the process of creating art while portraying that process as art. By doing this movie, Charlie Kaufman has written a screenplay about writing the screenplay adapting a book that turns into writing simply a screen play for this movie. Yes, its that kinda film. Prepare yourself for the giddy feeling of having your mind flop about in your head like a happily dying fish.I was prepared for a dialogue heavy case study of neurosis. No. Well, partly. But damn. There's also the stuff of obsession, crime, furious masturbation, and full-on ballpeen-to-the-skull visceral shock. This is a Jonze film. The man could film flowers blooming and make it interesting...oh wait...he does! And, hey, really nice shot of Meryl Streep's feet.And Cage...god, it was refreshing to see him do this work. Reminiscent of his mastery of nuanced character traits in Face-Off, and his ability to get at the ugly/beautiful core of the character in Wild at Heart and Leaving Las Vegas...this is fine acting. Good roles by the rest of the cast as well. Cooper was full of wisdom, wile, and boyish fragility. Streep was a wreck waiting to happen. And I kinda crushed on Seymour since I too have been in love with all the wrong timing.What leaves your little mind clawing out like a starving weasel at the end of this film is the horrendous blur between what was made with this movie and what was beyond the movie, existing before and after....With the elipses, heliovista meant to portray that this was a break in his thoughts. In reality he couldn't think of how to quite capture the effect that this movie had on him. It wasn't some 'profound' philosophical effect or anything. More like the effects of really good drugs for those who can admit that once in a while this is good and USEFUL. He gives up trying to explain it. I give up trying to explain it. He/I feel(s) that the review, while amateurish, is appropriate. But how to end it? I'll just click ""Preview"" now and go on. Kinda lame, but I'm no Charlie Kaufman."
537,Adaptation.,8,15 February 2005,"Intriguing , thought provoking movie","I enjoyed this movie. It was truly a story within a story within a story. I am still left wondering how much of the movie was true story and how much was written. I enjoyed Nicholas Cage's both neurotic and extroverted acting. The movie is quirky in the sort of way Kaufman's other movie, Being John Malkovich, was also quirky. It is definitely not a movie that everyone would like, so I can neither recommend or dissuade you from seeing it. But if you like movies that make you think, a little slow at the start, but the ""ending"" (which ending you'll be asking once you see it) is a great reward. Give it a try ...You might discover (as I have) a truly unique movie."
538,Adaptation.,10,4 February 2005,Layers of brilliance,"Words fail me when I attempt to convey the sublime genius that is Adaptation. I am writing this review with as much difficulty as Charlie writes his screenplays, mostly for fear of failing to do the film justice. How to start? This movie is about making itself...attempting to penetrate the thought process that led to its creation is very much like endeavoring to unravel once and for all the enigma of the chicken and the egg, only the chicken was never plagued with nagging doubts and self-loathing.Ostensibly, the film is an adaptation of a real book by a real author named Susan Orlean about a real man named John Laroche. It is adapted by Charlie Kaufman, a real screenwriter. When Charlie has trouble, he reluctantly seeks aid from his twin brother Donald, who is probably not real, or he may be more real than Charlie. He also gets advice from a screen writing instructor, who is real, and very understandably perplexed when he sees someone attend his lecture twice. In pursuit of his story, Charlie begins following Orlean, who at this point seems to have ceased being real and become a sort of idealized Orlean, or a convenient plot device. The genius of Adaptation is palpable at the end, when what could have been a self-indulgent, clichéd in-joke of a climax becomes in the hands of Kaufman and Jonze an allegorical journey of self-awareness, or maybe a battle between man and horse(alligator). You decide."
539,Adaptation.,9,6 January 2005,"Creative, sympathetic and fun","After having seen ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""Being John Malkovich"" and this movie, and event though I really didn't like ""Being JM"", I'd have to say that Charlie Kaufman is one of the best things to happen to Hollywood in a long time.Like the other movies based on his scripts, ""Adaptation"" is a movie that's very different and very original. That doesn't necessarily make it a good movie (Wes Anderson movies are also original and different, but not that great IMHO), but in this case everything adds up, making ""Adaptation"" one of the better movies I've seen lately.""Adaptation"" tells the story of a script writer, tasked with writing a seemingly impossible script, and stuck with a huge writer's block. At the same time, his brother successfully manages to write a script for one of the most silly serial movie thrillers ever. He decides to write himself into the script, at which point it becomes clear that the script he is writing actually is the script for the movie that we're already watching (which creates a very interesting circular reference).This is just one of the many clever touches in ""Adaptation"", which plays around with reality and movie clichés in a very intelligent way. It's full of interesting dialogs, good observations about movie scripts (like how every movie has to convey something ""significant"", and how the most inappropriate love stories are always inserted into movies) and much more.It's also a very sympathetic movie: there are no false sentiments here, no cop-out romantic ending, no dramatizing. It feels very honest and a lot more realistic than most other movies (despite the slightly surreal premise). Nicolas Cage, who I normally dislike quite a bit, is excellent in a double role as the nerdy script writer and his overconfident brother, and Meryl Streep (also not one of my favourites) does a good job as well. The real star here however is Chris Cooper, who plays a passionate orchid farmer/collector.If you look at it from a distance, this movie might sound dull. It's a fairly slow movie with lots of dialog and little action, and the subject matter doesn't sound too appealing either. But ""Adaptation"" shows beyond a doubt that with a lot of creativity and a lot of heart, even a fairly unappealing premise can be turned into a funny, charming and intelligent movie.Highly recommended ****1/2 out of *****"
540,Adaptation.,8,27 November 2004,Mister Writer...,"It's a tribute to Cage's virtuoso performance[s] that the same actor playing two roles - a device which is often of no more service than a cheap gimmick - actually fits snugly alongside the concepts being explored. In fact, much the same could be said of the film as a whole. For the first time, here is the 'trademark' Kauffman script that is surprising and inventive, but where the 'unconventional' aspects in this context seem entirely crucial to the themes. To a progressively lesser degree when approaching a 'Kauffman film' have I felt blindsided by a parade of oddities. This surely is a mark of his 'growth' as a writer - as is his readiness in ""Adaptation"" to deconstruct that ever-burgeoning maturity and take potshots at both the idiosyncrasies of his profession and his own self-image. Unfortunately though, said subject-matter isn't QUITE as insightful as all concerned might've hoped. For all the timeframe shifts that surround the central conceit, at heart it's only a simple, wistful tale of the writer's cursed lot. The good thing is, the astute script properly calls our attention to such an indulgence, so the periodic lapses into self-pity don't grate. The experience of watching ""Adaptation"" tells us that ANY writer can break all the rules, but to do it so knowingly and with such pointed satire is what makes a work transcend itself and become 'art'. Kauffman's quirky tales are each time out aligning themselves with more 'everyday' sensibilities, and eschewing the fantastical frippery. I'm all for such change, because from this one audience member's perspective, they just keep getting better and better! 8/10."
541,Adaptation.,10,1 November 2004,Brilliant,"Sigh... it's hard to sum up this movie other than just that one word, brilliant. The number one reason? This film is level upon level, story on top of story. Donald Kaufman is trying to adapt a book (The Orchid Thief) to film- nearly impossible because the book really has no plot. His love life is suffering, and his esteem is threatened when his idiot brother cranks out crap for his first screenplay, with an enthusiastic response. Meanwhile, he is becoming slowly obsessed with the author of the book. ""Adaptation"" comes to mean the foundation of the book, the incredibly varied species of orchid, but also the actual act of turning the book to film and the changing of lives that result. The Orchid Thief remains the basic story in the film, but, as Kaufman would wish it, it develops a bizarre plot of its own.Beautifully intricate, intelligent, and funny. I was horrified when it didn't win the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, and still can't for the life of me understand why. 10 out of 10."
542,Adaptation.,,29 October 2004,"Bizarre ride through minds of psychotic artistic ""geniuses""","Nicolas Cage's performance (in a double role as twin brothers) can convince anyone that a life as an artist in Hollywood is one of loneliness and psychosis. Success as a writer comes at the cost of fear to fail. Meryl Streep (in yet another tailor-made role) adds her own flavor of ""Silkwood-like"" depression to the picture.Cleverly intertwining story/plot keep you interested, especially the unexpected portions of (graphic) violence and terror. Sex, drugs and simultaneous refusal to accept responsibility for one's own actions eventually turn to repulsion. You lose empathy for the lead characters, who are hopelessly lost on a path of self-destruction. The innocence of beautiful orchids (the focal point of the story) is quickly put aside by the fast-paced story with its surprise shockers.THIS won all of the Oscar Nomination? Great acting, yes. Excellent script, OK. Enertainment? No way! This was a one-time-view for me, and I recommend this film only to die hard fans of the actors, presuming they have a strong stomach for extreme violence. The stuff that nightmares are made of!"
543,Adaptation.,,26 October 2004,Hamlet redux,"(spoilers)This movie strongly reminds me of Hamlet. The first three and a half hours of Hamlet are quietly brooding, a masterpiece of writing about an ineffectual man going slowly insane because of his inability to do what he knows he has to. Charlie Kaufman is the same in many ways-a brooding, ineffectual man full of self loathing. The last act of Hamlet reads like an Elizabethean version of a Micheal Bay film. There are tons of cheesy improbables-pirates, sword fights, suicides, mass poisonings, a wild funeral, etc. It looks as though Shakespeare just tacked that last bit on to make it more palatable to those in the pits-i.e., the low brow, low class people who had to put up with the first three hours of high brow brooding and angst from the Melancholy Dane. In other words, the play's ending got Hollywoodized. The end of Adaptation is the same-over the top, full of clichés and wild happenings that don't exactly fit the rest of the film. Whether this is Spike Jonze's way of brilliantly satirizing Hollywood films or not, it still left an odd, disjointed feeling at the end of the film. I felt the same way as I did when I watched Hamlet-as though I'd been cheated of the more serious and introspective storyline by the cartoon drama that replaced it for the last bit. That's why I don't watch Hamlet too often, and why I will only watch it until the 'now my thoughts be bloody or naught' speech that should have been the real ending of the play. And if I ever watch Adaptation again, I might just do the same and skip the weird and rather silly ending altogether."
544,Adaptation.,,30 September 2004,Adaptation Indeed!,"**** SPOILERS AHEAD ****How appropriate? The title is almost as clever as the film itself.Adaptation IS the essence of this film. It's about adaptation of a novel to screen, adaptation of plant species through evolution, adaptation (evolution) of characters to their new circumstances and environment, and even the adaptation (evolution) of the screenplay from Charlie Kaufman's (Cage) conservative early efforts to Donald Kaufman's (Cage again) dramatic conclusion. I particularly enjoyed the irony of author Susan Orleans' (Streep) transformation from conservative, (unhappily) married, cultured journalist, to someone that finds the passion she desperately seeks through adultery and drug use.The closing scenes involving Orlean, Laroche and Kaufman in the everglades first of all seemed so out of character with the rhythm of the film yet at the same time, prove so critical to its conclusion. I've had to shuffle my top ten movies for this little gem."
545,Adaptation.,,29 September 2004,"Have you read the book, ""Orchid Thief?""...Lets not be cliché.","OK so I really didn't READ the book but recently I need to drive across five states and I was looking for something to help me make the drive. I found a book Close-out store that was selling some audio books for cheap. So I bought 4 audio books, one happened to be, The Orchid Thief. It was a close-out store and 'the Pickens was slim.' I chose this book because I have recently started a house plant hobby and some of those plants are orchids. It kind of intrigued me because of my hobby. Well after listening to the book I was discussing it with someone and they told me that I should see the movie Adaptation. And so I did. I think that made all the difference in the world. With out listening to the book I could see how the obscurity of the movie could turn some folks off. But with my experience the movie was very clever. The foundation of why it was clever is the foundation of how well Susan Orlean had written her book. She did an outstanding job in providing information from many perspectives and creating continually that may not have existed unless you lived in some part of the worlds she described. Kaufman was clever for many reasons but first off was how he was able to take the story Susan had written as his foundation. And Clever is smart here. As I watched the movie I found myself following the detail in the book, almost like watching the proverbial bouncing ball. As I focused on the bouncing ball, BOOM, the movie exploded into an interesting story. Like many stories that give the most believability, mixing a little bit of fact unraveled in some fiction. I've read some of the reviews and take them in context; learning to see it even more differently than I may have before. There are two parts to the story and some things are deliberate, as artists entangle a lot of elements deliberately to entice us to view it as we do not as they do. And that is the heart of artistic expression. Not for all, and all don't really quite get itit's a challenge. It's clever! So read the book if you can or just listen to it, it adds to the experience. And that is what our movies are today. The experience of being drawn into the story and feeling as though it was not like the last story you heardmovie you sawnot cliché."
546,Adaptation.,8,5 September 2004,Even if Nicholas Cage ain't your thing...,"Something about that guy churns my stomach on most of his performances. I'm sure it's that he seems to be on dope. That is perfect for e.g. Tommy Chong, but not this guy. I'll admit that I liked City of Angels - though Dennis Franz did more talking and Cage was largely silent throughout the film!But I have to change my tune for this flick. It's good acting. The DVD interestingly analyzes his ""style"" versus Meryl Streep's.The film itself challenges you mentally (something I don't say often), and the main cast beside him is of course superb. Fine flick.P.S. For the sake of credibility I must admit that I also give high marks to Face/Off, and his non-dopey role there :)"
547,Adaptation.,10,23 August 2004,i can't believe how good this movie is.,"I'm at a loss for words as to how to summarize this movie. I usually hate Nicholas Cage (lone exception Leaving Las Vegas) but here he does a perfect job. Every word the falls from every characters mouth seems like genius. This movie has thus affected me on so many levels. This movie feels personal to me. The winding logic and cynical humor, the intelligent dialogue and subtle acting. The twisting plot makes me feel as though every time I've pegged down one interpretation another one seems equally as plausible. Charley Kaufman's screenplay may be the best movie to come out of Hollywood since Pulp Fiction. This is just a splendid movie that leaves me grinning from ear to ear each time I watch it.Then there's the boxing Charles Darwin.... I can't in any manifestation or manipulation of the English language express how cool i think the boxing Charles Darwin is. This movie is absolutely the best. cry ouroboros, eating it's own tail. This is a movie worthy of total commitment to memory. 10 out of 10, as if the review didn't establish that already."
548,Adaptation.,8,12 August 2004,"Creative, interesting, and different","Adaptation is a great movie that I've seen recently. I think Spike Jonze did a top-notch job on this film. He kept me watching and not once did i get up to get something to eat or go to the bathroom. I wanted to find out what was going to happen next, because it was so creative. It didn't sell out or go for some cheap, Hollywood ending...it just delivered what it could. I think it was awesome wow Nicolas Cage played two parts, as well as the movie switching back and forth. I couldn't tell if the movie was writing the book or whether the book was creating the movie. But they molded in the end and it all made sense...or did it? I think this was a wonderful script and Jonze directed it in a way that made it all the best to watch."
549,Adaptation.,5,21 August 2004,Very disappointing (minor spoilers),"Sometimes I read all the reviews, sometimes I just watch a movie and see how it turns out. Maybe I shouldn't have done the latter with Adaptation.Confusing but not especially intelligent, the first 90 minutes of this movie are really dull. Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with the slow pace, but Adaptation makes no secret of it's desperation for a good story.When the pace finally picks up, the ending drops down to standard Hollywood fare, wasting the opportunity for a satisfying pay-off.Only worth watching if you have an interest in orchids or Hollywood screenwriters."
550,Adaptation.,9,20 August 2004,"In a Word, Awesome","One of the best films I've seen in the past few years, which is saying a lot.Charlie Kaufman writes movies. However, he goes largely unnoticed by most people, living in the shadow of his more popular brother Donald who has an ego the size of a small planet. After the success of the movie, ""Being John Malkovich"", he wants to continue to do great movies. But his next assignment is a real doozy...He has been assigned to adapt a book about orchids, titled ""The Orchid Thief"", into a movie. However, it's such a powerful and moving book about what seems to be absolutely nothing, he has no idea how to begin.The movie is a wonderful comedy-drama about the trials and tribulations of being a writer. I don't know, maybe it spoke to me a lot more than other people, but it was a great movie and one well worth seeing."
551,Adaptation.,7,5 August 2004,what about the Wong Kar-Wai homage?,"I haven't read Susan Orleans' book, and my history with the work of Charlie Kaufman is limited to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), and Being John Malkovich (1999). So far, I haven't been let down by any of his work.with all that's been written in previous comments on this site, I don't think I can say much more... except that it is obviously that the ending sequence of the movie is either a tribute or made to remind us of Wong Kar Wai's HAPPY TOGETHER (1996). The use of the Turtle's song, as well as the time-lapse photography showing moving traffic is almost a direct shot-for-shot copy... only differences here being the addition of flowers in the foreground, and the shot being more eye-level than in Happy Together.so much for my trivial drivel....is the screenplay a cop-out, or genius? Having seen Kaufman's previous work, the idea of stories/screenplays/memory/the writing process taking on a life of its own has become somewhat of a trademark to me. What amazes me is how each of the 3 films I've mentioned managed to convey the ""life"" of these intangibles so thought-provokingly, yet not making his audience feel like they need a MA in Critical Studies just to ""get it.""The Coen Brothers did a great job bringing to life the nightmares that writers suffer when they hit the wall with Barton Fink (1990). That was a film that warranted many viewings for me to appreciate all the intricate layers that touched on, 1) the old Hollywood studio system, 2) the notion about what is ""high handed"" writing versus what some writers would consider ""selling out"" by not wanting to write to ""the common man"" (i.e. remember what John Goodman's character keeps shouting before he torched the hotel?), and also 3) the fear of a writer for not-being-able-to write, which most screen-writers would probably feel is the loneliest and scariest moment to endure....am I losing you?Charlie Kaufman managed to turn a novel/story that most writers would probably consider impossible to turn into a decent screenplay, into a journey about the roller-coaster ride of the writing process. When McKEE the script guru tells him to change the ending to make a crappy script work, the story takes that route and we get the swamp scenes and the car crash... He shows us how the screenwriter can get lost in the writing process (as we do before the ending), and how copping-out does sometime make it work, and the audience wouldn't know the difference. In other words, all the characters in the story are no different than the John Malkovich and Jim Carrey's in his other screenplays - they are all his creations, and Kaufman boldly and proudly reminds us the almighty power of the pen.It is almost as if he took on The Orchid Thief as a bet...cop-out or genius... Kaufman wins handsdown."
552,Adaptation.,9,1 August 2004,A film that will keep messing with your mind,"A story within a story within a story.lather, rinse, repeat.  That is the M.O. of the three Charlie Kauffman-penned films that I have seen, one of them being the just-viewed film, `Adaptation.', directed by Spike Jonze, and starring Nicholas Cage, Chris Cooper and Meryl Streep.  It isn't easy to describe the plot of this film, which is sometimes a good thing, sometimes a bad thing.  My determination will come shortly, but the most basic summary of the story is that Charlie Kauffman (Nicholas Cage) has found success with `Being John Malkovich' and has been hired to adapt the best-selling novel `The Orchid Thief' by Susan Orlean.  That he has no idea how to successfully do this is exacerbated by the fact that his twin brother Donald, a free-spirit who decides one day that he wants to be a screenwriter like his brother, has found success with his first screenplay, a Bruckheimer-esque action film that is the polar opposite of what Charlie tends to write.  In his quest to write this screenplay, he ends up fantasizing about and eventually stalking Orlean, leading to some pretty bizarre consequences.Ever since I watched this film, I have not been able to get it out of my head.  I think I have everything figured out, until I realize that there is yet one more plot ramification that is serially profound to the core theme. Trying to decipher all of the meaning and complexities of `Adaptation.' is like playing with one of those Russian nesting dolls; you open up one doll and there is another inside then another, and so on.  There are many, many layers to this film  and I absolutely loved it.  As with the other Kauffman films I have seen, I come away from the film feeling both dumb and smart; dumb because I'm scratching my head, but then progressively smarter because as I pick away at the subtleties, I realize that I am doing something that I don't do nearly enough of since college  I'm using my brain.  How many films can we apply that statement to in our homogenized `blockbuster film' culture?  When the movies we (and yes, I include myself in most of this) race to on opening night to see are films that feature the most epic sets, the most explosions and usually, at best, the most average in acting capability, it is films like this that make me truly love `Film'.  Instead of pushing our intelligence aside to provide sensory overload, screenwriters like Kauffman and directors like Jonze provide us with the ultimate compliment  they assume that the audience wants, and can `handle' an incredibly intelligent film that is not neatly sewn up from beginning to end.Under Jonze's great direction, (I loved the alternate mediums he uses  hand-held camera, video camera, steady-cam, etc.) Cage, Streep and Cooper shine.  While I watched, I couldn't help thinking that a lot of credit has to be given to them for being in this film, something that I have felt during all of Kauffman's films.  Mainstream stars like Nicholas Cage, Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, etc. have turned out some of their best performances in his films, while not changing the integrity of the film.  Meryl Streep in particular, no stranger to phenomenal performances, really played an interesting part in this film, and while I enjoy almost all of her work, I couldn't help but be particularly endeared to her in `Adaption.' because it really is an unusual role for her. Don't even bother with this film if you like to have your films end when the credits do, because it will stay with you.  I watched this film five days ago and it is still haunting me to the point where if I have a spare few minutes to myself I find myself working it out in my head like some complex puzzle.  Kudos to Jonze, Kauffman and the actors.  I eagerly await Kauffman's next offering and hope for another Jonze-Kauffman collaboration in the future.--Shelly"
553,Adaptation.,10,7 July 2004,"All the self-doubt, existential, self-loathing, mind screwing comedy you can take.","Maybe it's just that I'm an angst-ridden doubt-filled writer, but I found that I could see myself in every awkward situation Kaufman got into. You cannot describe this movie as any one thing. It's a movie about making a movie, but not in the typical sense. It's a love story, though at times it seems like the furthest thing from the tangled idiosyncracies of Kaufman's whacked imagination. The script could have been marketed as a manual for how to turn your own insignificant thoughts and experiences into an enthralling story that encompasses the entire spectrum of humanity's long process of self-diagnosis we call consciousness. ""Being John Malkovitch"" was just a taste. Now, er... have another taste!"
554,Adaptation.,9,1 July 2004,Well done,"What a wild ride! You certainly don't expect that when you begin watching it.  Nicholas Cage gives an outstanding performance in the duel roles and really makes you believe he is playing two entirely different people.  Chris Cooper is wonderful in his supporting part as the eccentric orchid thief. He truly makes you see him as that character and his oscar was well deserved. As always, Meryl Streep is fabulous. She cares about all the characters she plays and always makes you get to know them.At its core, this movie has a soul and a purpose that truly rewards the viewer. It's also informative to aspiring screenwriters. 8.5/10"
555,Adaptation.,,17 June 2004,Multiple Personalities and Multiple Films,"Nicholas Cage plays a real-life writer and his fictional alter-ego in this engaging story of inspiration and integrity.To me this film was about a writer who wants to create something beautiful but is slowly being seduced by the urge to 'Hollywoodize' his work.Internally he's shy and insecure, but outwordly he puts on a false front of ambition and congeniality.The film presents the two sides of this character as twin brothers. One who is trying to adapt a serious piece of literature, the other who tries his hand at writing an action film where the main character has multiple personalities.Slowly the serious writer learns to embrace the base ideas of his 'brother' and even asks him for advice on how to end his film. Naturally his alter-ego suggests a ridiculous action-packed climax.This film is to be viewed on several levels. Once you get past the fact that it's not about what it seems to be about it becomes a masterpiece."
556,Adaptation.,,5 June 2004,Ouroboros,"***Warning, spoilers here, don't read this unless you really, really want to***Wow, the cathartic story of a man writing a screenplay about himself writing a screenplay about himself writing a screenplay while at the same time showing the movie that is actually being written. But while the first hour of the movie is beautifully witty and delightfully tongue in cheek, the second half loses itself in a farcical satire of itself as Charlie Kaufman becomes involved in the sort of Hollywood ending that he professes to despise. The basic premise is very clever - show two movies at once. The first being Charlie's ""Mockumentary"" about a fat, timid, balding, yet romantic screenwriter who is writing the second movie; which is of course Meryl Streep's ""Sue Orlean"". The two separate movies remain that, separate, with Charlie desperate to avoid contact with Sue Orlean at all costs and this is where Ouroboros comes in. The two movies do not progress while they are self-contained. Both Charlie and Sue appear to go round and round on cycles of self-recrimination and regret for what they are losing in life - Sue because of a passionless recital of sociability, Charlie because of bottomless self-loathing which he reads into everyone else's thoughts. It is Donald, Charlie's twin brother (and possibly his own creation) who finally gets Kaufman to stop biting his own tail and seek outside assistance - from a ""mentor"" figure - Mckee. Once this happens then the two movies meet - Charlie and Donald begin to find the ""real"" story behind ""The Orchid Thief"" and, well, Charlie loses his ideal beauty-of-flowers plot line and finds himself entangled in a patently ridiculous deus-ex-coca subplot that provides what Mckee would have called a good ending. The big joke is supposed to be that ""life imitates art"" and that all around the world everyday life is filled with Hollywood-style stories of betrayal and greed and lust and murder and that a book may be able to end with a sense of unfulfilled longing but a movie should have a ""wow"" ending. And what happens? Well, Kaufman (real Kaufman) lets the movie end with flowers. Big laugh all round, hahahaha, we get to go home and nurse our intellectual grievances against the box office. Overall 7.5 out of 10"
557,Adaptation.,,14 May 2004,Chaos within order...,"Okay, I'm not even going to pretend this comment is unbiased because viewing Adaptation was the last time I can recall being more impressed with a screenplay than the final movie.  Mr. Kaufman totally blew away the idea of a normal 'structure' for a movie, but then, somehow managed to place all of his chaotic idea's within an amazing, three act screenplay.  So in essence, he hasn't written anything but a 'normal' movie, but in watching this flick you will see that it is actually so much more.  I love this movie.  Mr. Kaufman is one of the most talented (I would almost go so far as to say that IS the most talented) screenwriters out there, and any praise this guy gets is well deserved.  He's taking these movies that we all love and pushing the boundaries while still maintaining a familiar feeling.  Great movie, can't recommend it enough."
558,Adaptation.,,24 April 2004,funny idea...,"One long bizarre joke about the presence of the author in any work, or,... is this review just another meta reference by Charlie Kaufman mocking the voices that respond to the voices of movies and books?This film exists to officially mark the moment when the crisis of sincerity in post-modern narrative finally reached the popular filmgoing audience. So this movie is able to be unsatisfying in many more ways than just a straightforward adaptation would have been. The catalog of hackneyed Hollywood narrative devices is occasionally funny, but as the movie finishes it's complete dependence on them to bring the story to resolution is played straight, for the amusement of those aware of the commentary it is utilizing them to make... however,... as much as I'd admit that that is funny described on paper, it just isn't that funny in reality.My head hurts.If you are interested in this movie, do yourself a favor; stop reading about it and just see it."
559,Adaptation.,10,23 April 2004,Now that's what I have been wanting to see,"This is perhaps the funniest cleverest movie I have seen.  Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is that it actually manages to convey the sense of the original novel and the beauty of flowers while delivering everything else.  I can only hope that the sly wink at Hollywood that is the end of this movie will not be missed by people when they watch it.  Comments about the state of the industry and the art form do not get much more . . . shall we say ""taut"" than this movie, Charlie Kaufman's best screenplay to date.  Cooper deserves his Oscar.  That the Pianist won best screenplay over this has got to be a joke.  I thought Being John Malkovich was dull and overrated in spite of being original.  But I hope that Kaufman continues to turn out original movies like his character (or is it Nicholas Cage's) strives to do Adaptation.  Good luck to him."
560,Adaptation.,10,28 March 2004,Frighteningly funny illustration of every writer's inner monologue.,Hysterical!  You feel both mortified and completely sympathetic to Charlie's difficulties with life and work.  Can he remain true to the novel?  Can he avoid all the usual Hollywood fixes?  The life and times of Charlie and Donal Kaufman are fascinating to watch because they reflect so clearly the every day struggles of any artist or for that matter anyone not blazing with charisma and self confidence.In the end you get some great laughs.  And you know what?  So does Charlie Kaufman.
561,Adaptation.,8,24 March 2004,A movie that plays with your mind (but in a good way),"In trying to write this review I have come to the conclusion that Adaptation is definitely one of those films you need to see more than once in order to fully appreciate it. Cleverly written with good dialogue, it will leave the viewer with many things to question and ponder throughout, not least the degree to which it is a true story (I had to search IMDb straight afterwards to try and find out!). Nicholas Cage turns in a really excellent performance as both Charlie Kaufman and his brother Donald. He displays the sharp contrasts in their characters superbly, and the best scenes in the film are those when both brothers are present. Having seen very few of Cage's films I was pleasantly surprised to see what a good actor he can be when freed from the constraints of more typical Hollywood roles like Cameron Poe in Con Air. He plays Charlie especially well, capturing the nature of a man plagued by nervousness and self-doubt very astutely and amusingly. Comedy and drama are combined to good effect, and the film keeps surprising the viewer throughout with a range of twists and turns. There are moments when the film moves a little too slowly and becomes frustrating, although perhaps this is intended to give a sense of the struggle involved in the writing process (students of Film Studies would be better placed to tell you this than me!). Overall this is an enjoyable and thought provoking film which thoroughly deserves the acclaim it has received.Rating out of 100: 75"
562,Adaptation.,10,25 March 2004,An Excellent Movie for the Gullible,"This movie is far too sophisticated for the average viewer. However, it is a wonderful film for the psuedo-intellectual but gullible audience for which it is intended.Folks like me who love to be entertained and have our chain yanked at the same time just eat this stuff up. We love to sit around for hours just wondering about what it all means and whether or not Charlie portrays himself and other characters realistically, or if it is all in his imagination. We also love spending hours pouring over the various reviews and critiques from other smarter folks who seem to grasp the concepts even better than ourselves so that we can learn from their understanding. Not to mention reading the attempted reviews from the folks who think the movie had some deep meaning, hahahahaha!So, the bottom line is, if you are looking for a movie with truly deep meaning that only a few very smart people can benefit from, or a mindless entertaining romp jam packed with action then you may want to look elsewhere. But if you want an awesome excuse to discuss a movie with lots of people, and like to be manipulated, then this is the perfect film. Besides, as it turns out Charlie really does have a brother and they were both nominated for an Oscar for the screenplay. So, maybe it is all pretty much just based on facts anyway."
563,Adaptation.,7,9 March 2004,Psychic!?!?!,"Wow, Nice plot... 'Cage' if ""THE"" man. Without such a role exploit, the film is nothing. Story is just fine. Finishing touch is guaranteed... Psychic analysis of a Charles Kaufman... Nice... Well directed and the screenplay is just great. The script is well balanced and smooth. Well performed by Cage.  Those roles he had taken are just stunning. Not less is Suzanne's role."
564,Adaptation.,,12 March 2004,What a rush!,"""Adaptation"" has to be the weirdest, most original and quite simply the BEST film I've seen in a long time! The characters are well fleshed out and the sterling cast does a sparkling script justice. But it is Chris Cooper that simply astounds. John La Roche is easily the most original character to have come out of Hollywood. The story about an unfilmable book is one that I, as a wannabe screenwriter, can relate to and the anguish that Nic Cage portrays is quite believable. Meryl Streep is wonderful as usual, although Maggie Gyllenhaal is criminally underused. Altogether this is one of the best films of the year!"
565,Adaptation.,10,4 March 2004,Quite simply the best movie about writing movies.,"As a writer myself who started off in theatre and sold my soul to television, and detest Robert McKee and everything he stands for. and all the editors and producers out there who use his words as a litany. [You know who you are]  I completely identify with this movie. I ran with it all the way.. And now all I have to do is convince the missus to watch it so that she can crawl inside my head for a while and know that when I'm staring out the window or, pulling fluff from my naval, or eating junk or playing poker that I'm really working and getting those creative juices going.There's a touch of Donald and Charlie in most writers I know [The good ones]
Excellent movie and big Charlie Kaufman fan."
566,Adaptation.,10,17 February 2004,Original and Fantastic,The first time that I saw this film I was amazed how it mocks itself by threatening to sell out and then it does it!! One of the most original films I have ever seen. It really does have a lot of lines that repeat in your head... and it actually added to my appreciation of orchids. A lot of screenwriters could learn from Kaufman's example. He is always pushing the limits and questioning the nature of our society. Another fantastic film. Bravo Kaufman.
567,Adaptation.,,15 February 2004,Surreal and Amusing Comedy-Drama,"This film really is one of a kind.  Starting life when script-writer Charlie Kaufman was suffering writer's block while attempting to adapt Susan Orlean's best-selling book ""The Orchid Thief"" into a film.  Instead of doing a straight adaptation of the book, Kaufman decided to write about himself trying to adapt the book. The finished film switches between scenes from ""The Orchid Thief"" to scenes of Kaufman (played by Nicolas Cage) trying to write his script. 
The film has some interesting depictions of the creative writing process. There are none of the usual cliches of clattering keyboards, dramatic music and seemingly devine inspiration.  Instead, Kaufman spends most of his writing time in mental anguish staring at the blank page.The acting in this film is impressive.  Nicolas Cage is very good in a difficult dual role as both Charlie Kaufman and his irritating twin brother Donald.  Meryl Streep is fine as the author Susan Orlean and Chris Cooper won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the arrogant orchid thief John Laroche.You have to admire Kaufman's guts in writing this film, actually.  He doesn't portray himself in a very good light at all.  Also most of the other characters in the film are based on real people. This film won't be to everyone's taste but personally, I thought it was great.  Very funny and clever.  I'd recommend anyone looking for a truly original Hollywood movie to at least give it a go."
568,Adaptation.,,24 January 2004,one of the best written stories within a story within a story (did I leave one out?) I have ever seen.,"I thoroughly enjoyed everything about the movie ""Adaptation""... the writing, acting, directing, script... and it was even better the second time around. If you've seen it once and `weren't sure' see it twice and you will be. One of the best-written stories within a story within a story (did I leave one out?) I have ever seen."
569,Adaptation.,10,2 February 2004,Experimental comedy at its best,"The thing I liked the most about this movie is that Nicholas Cage is back in the weird characters that he always portayed so well.'Adaptation' is more like a game, made of part real, part fictional elements. Reality and fantasy are mixed up into a story that takes a step beyond 'Being John Malkovich'. We are mesmerized by Kaufman's ability to take extreme fiction and make it into a ""real"" story in such a flawless and unpredictable way.Having said that I don't think that the movie is entirely balanced or focused. When the big lie that extends from the book to the life of the researcher, is revealed, which to me is the sole purpose of the movie, we are already lost in a conventional ending that makes no sense.But of course this may be the actual purpose of the movie. That reality is conventional and nonsense and that what seems ideal cannot in fact exist in real life.9/10"
570,Adaptation.,10,15 January 2004,Nothing I've seen quite like it...,"I have read many of the other comments on this movie and I feel many of you have missed the true meaning.  I have argued with my own father who is also an avid movie buff like myself about this film.  So far the person who entitled his comment ""Imagine Me and You I Do"" seemed to understand this film the best, yet that person should have made a more in depth comment about the film.  The main point that was made was the Donald was not a real person and that everyone in the movie was a real person in real life except for Donald (Charlie Kaufman was the real writer of this movie however both Charlie and Donald were nominated for the Oscar, which gives great insight on the meaning of this movie.)  Yes, it is about Charlie trying to adapt the book ""The Orchid Theif"" into a screenplay, but more so it is about his battle with coming to terms and being OK with himself as a person. Charlie and Donald are just two seperate parts of the same person.  Charlie is the artist who wants to be true and make an artistic movie and be true to himself, Donald on the other hand writes average run of the mill action type films that are very predictable and nothing special.  The movie then brings both characters together as Charlie accepts who he is and shows that both parts are good and can co exist in the same person.  This is done beautifully by the funny techniques in the film, such as the comment that movies with commentary suck and there is commentary in the whole movie.  I believe that much of the movie is simply Charlie dreaming, or basically not really happening.  He really never meets the writer of the Orchid Theif, he is imagining the relationship between her and the hunter, and then he writes himself into the story.  When he accepts his brother and lets him in, the movie gets crazy and you get that typical drama that we all know and love, which is exciting.  I know I am rambling on a bit, so I hope that my comment at least give some insight and allows you to look at this movie from a different angle.  This is a great movie and can really blow your mind if you pay attention to the game that is being played between the writer/director and the audience.  One of the most innovative stories I've ever seen."
571,Adaptation.,,23 January 2004,A Creative Breath of Fresh Air,A hilarious Hollywood/Anti-Hollywood romp.  The ever reliable Streep gives her best performance in years and the too-lately often barely tolerable Cage shines as the Kaufman twins.  Chris Cooper's over-the-top performance is both touching and hilarious.  Adaptation is a breath of fresh air far away from the usual Hollywood smog. Jones and company should keep 'em coming!
572,Adaptation.,8,10 January 2004,"like the writer for most of the story, I cannot finish my summary","I think some of my hesitation to rave about this comes from two points: 1) I was looking forward to seeing this for a number of months 2) I just saw the Lord of the Rings finaleIt is a very good script with good performances and good scenes - but somehow something is holding me back from saying this is an awesome flick.Let me try to put it this way, years from now is Nicolas Cage going to be known for this role - or is this just an interesting role (but not as good as Raising Arizona) amongst his other blockbusters? Is this Meryl Streep's finest performance or just another ""good"" part.It is worth seeing, more so than another work called Gone in 60 Seconds I watched the other day but for some reason (perhaps hair style?) when watching Adaptation I kept on thinking ""hey that's Nicholas Cage""."
573,Adaptation.,,5 January 2004,Genius in its rarest form!,"Adaptation is one of the most truly original films I've ever seen.While Being John Malkovich was mind-blowing, somewhere in the middle, the joke began to feel tired to me. But, in Adaptation, Kaufman keeps the pace and story by constantly changing the pace and story!The overall concept isn't that new: a movie about making a movie. But, the real Kaufman and Jonze took it to a new level by having the film change as the writers change their script. As one brother, Charlie Kaufman, struggles to remain true to his art in creating a screenplay without Hollywood formula car chases and explosions and sex and murder, the other brother, Donald, is writing the world's most fomulaic script, including multiple personalities and the old switcheroo suprise.Charlie struggles to find the thread of his artistic story. Faced with failure, he brings in his brother, Donald, to help finish the script. Suddenly, the script/film you're watching--which was original and without Hollywood formula--suddenly does just what the King of Formula suggests: it wows you in the end with formula. Just that alone is a remarkable thing to watch!I strongly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys different.
Oh! And, I've since read the Orchid Thief and I can see why Kaufman would have had trouble adapting it!"
574,Adaptation.,9,3 January 2004,Uplifting,"This film surprised me.  The trailer left me with a fairly negative view on what the film would be like.  There are very few films which you finish feeling uplifted.  The acting truly was of another level.  Meryl Streep's performance was fantastic, particularly when intoxicated with the drug extracted from the Ghost Orchid.I did feel that Nicholas Cage's zany performance as the troubled screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was fairly incongruent with the ambience of the film, but barely damaged the film and overall, the film blew me away.Verdict: 9/10.  Watch it.  Even if this film is not of your taste, you WILL admire it on some level."
575,Adaptation.,,1 January 2004,Watch the trailer,"Yeah it seems that several people were disappointed with the ending because they didn't understand it. In that case I encourage to watch the movie again, or if you don't have time then should watch the trailer and you'll get the point.SPOILER:Actually, the answer is clearly laid out in the scene in the bar between Kaufman and scriptwriting guru Robert McKee. Kaufman explains the story of the book, and McKee responds:MCKEE: I see... That's not a movie... You've gotta go back, put in the drama.KAUFMAN: I can't go back. I've got pages of false starts of wrong approaches. I'm way past my deadline.MCKEE: Tell you a secret. The last act makes the film. Wow them at the end, and you've got a hit. You can have flaws, problems, but wow them at the end and you've got a hit. Find an ending. But don't cheat! And don't you dare bring in a deus ex machina. Your characters must change and the change must must come from them. Do that and you'll be fine.Apparently, in the original script for the movie, the ending was supposed to have a swamp monster come and kill Donald and Laroche... but the ending was changed. But I think having a swamp monster would have been brilliant and would have brought home the point of the ending alot stronger to the audience (especially the reference to the deus ex machina). Nonetheless, this is still a brilliant movie."
576,Adaptation.,9,7 January 2004,"Smart, funny, weird, insightful, different, brilliant!","Some sort-of spoilers...A movie about flowers may not have been interesting, but a movie about trying to write a movie about flowers sure is.  ""Adaptation"" is part satire, documentary, introspective meditation, comedy, drama and cliche Hollywood film (although that's really the satire part)...  The film has many thoughtful and interesting parts in the early stages as it explores what apparently made ""The Orchid Thief"" a successful enough book to be optioned for a film version.  Along the way, Charlie Kaufman struggles with his own limitations as a writer and a person in trying to adapt the book to work as a film.  Though he ends up giving up, in a way, or giving in, in order to give the movie some kind of dramatic conclusion, I'm glad that he did. As absurd as the ending sequence gets, it is amusing for what it is, and especially to realize how and why it became that, and who is responsible (Donald). And Kaufman is still being true to the essence of the story that he set up while also having a major goof with it, so even screenwriting 'guru' McKee should have approved. Gimmicky, to be sure, but well executed, and a lot of colorful things along the way, especially in the way of Chris Cooper's John Laroche and Meryl Streep as Susan Orlean.9 out of 10"
577,Adaptation.,9,7 January 2004,A masterpiece,"Boy, to be a fly on the wall for this movie pitch. A fictional movie about the inside of a real writer's head that's writing a half-real screenplay about a real book based upon real characters.  This movie works on all those levels with amazing and surprising intersections between the layers.  This is one of the most creative screenplays I've ever seen.  It's just so funny and clever and recursive, especially how it handles the ""second part"" of the movie (I don't think it's a spoiler to call it hilarious satire). I didn't even know that ""The Orchid Thief"" was a real book based on real characters... and it blows me away that Charlie and Donald Kaufman were both nominated for ""Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published"", which must have been quite an interesting decision for the Academy."
578,Adaptation.,9,29 December 2003,"Imagine Me and You, I Do....","Anyone who doesn't get this movie, its EXTRAORDINARILY simple, and I think maybe people have tried to read too much into it...The song is the transfer point. ""Imagine Me and You"" is when control of the script is relinquished from one brother to the other...and please note the most important fact of the movie: Virtually every character introduced is a REAL person in REAL life...EXCEPT DONALD!!!!!He is not real, in a world where everything else is, so he is merely an extension of Charlie Kaufman's mind, the hack that lives inside of his brain and tells him to adhere to the formulaic hollywood bullshit that he hates so much--its his innate desire to conform, we are all programmed with it as social beings...in order for a true resolve to take place, he needs to embrace this side of himself, and come to terms with it, adapt it to his creative desire to innovate.  He does just this at the end, and is able to take the script back over."
579,Adaptation.,9,3 January 2004,oddly moving (SPOILERS),"This movie at first seems like one long joke. At the beginning Charlie tells Valerie that he wants his movie adaptation to ""exist rather than be artificially plot-driven."" He doesn't want it to be ""an orchid-heist movie,"" or ""a movie about drug-running."" He doesn't want to ""cram in sex or guns or car chases, or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end."" And later on Charlie tells his brother Donald re: the latter's screenplay, ""The only idea more overused than serial killers is multiple personality [disorder]."" Of course part of the fun for the viewer is picking out these cliched elements in the movie (my favorite is the multiple personality).Is it a satire? I don't think so; the movie likes to poke fun at the real Charlie as well as all the aforementioned devices, but the devices are executed without hint of parody. For example (spoiler warning), one of the ""profound life lessons,"" uttered by Donald (not LaRoche or Orlean, through whom the movie genuinely tries to romanticize flowers as a metaphor for life) turns out to be  ""you are what you love."" The moment was rather touching. In this movie, where ""nothing much happens,"" Charlie and Susan are engaging and I found it easy to become interested in what happens to them. Also noteworthy are the two car crashes in the movie: unexaggerated, poker-faced, and brutally executed.The most outstanding thing about the movie is that it seems to have succeeded in being the snake that swallows its own tail. Let me attempt to describe the ""plot."" The movie is about Charlie Kaufman trying to write a movie adaptation of Susan Orlean's book The Orchid Thief. Supposedly some years before we see Susan getting to know John LaRoche and his obsession with the ""ghost orchid."" Anyway, searching for inspiration Charlie along with Donald spy on LaRoche and Susan who by now are involved in an affair. The latter try to kill the former. Charlie becomes inspired and finishes his screenplay. The end. But the screenplay is the screenplay of the very movie you just finished watching. So the movie is about Charlie trying to adapt a book into a movie which in the end turns out to be a movie about Charlie trying to adapt a book into a movie... you get a pleasant dialtone buzz just thinking about it."
580,Adaptation.,,27 December 2003,why did this movie get so much acclaim,"I didn't think there was anything great about this film. Not much happens plot wise, and I don't get why the acting is considered special. I didn't think the acting stood out from other films.  Basically, Nic Cage plays some neurotic screen writer, trying to write a screen play about a boring book. Throughout, we get flashbacks from 3 years earlier of how the author got the idea to write her book. It jumps back and forth 3 years with not much explanation, which is just another reason I didn't think this movie was very good.The only good scene is when we get a realistic perspective of a car crash from the victim in the car.FINAL VERDICT:  Not worth your time."
581,Adaptation.,,26 December 2003,Cool Beans,"I started to watch this movie because nothing else was on TV. Thank God nothing was on TV because i saw one of the best movies ever. Granted it starts out slow but in the end i couldnt keep my eyes of the TV screen. Bravo to Cage for giving the greatest performance ever, he plays his own twin, WOW. The plot is original and funny. Watch it.....trust me.Rating: Eight Thumbs Up"
582,Adaptation.,,8 December 2003,A man trying to adapt a book only to experience a journey that will change his overall outlook on life,"This film was truly brilliant and anyone who wants to argue that with me I urge to private message me.  I watched this film with a few of my friends the other night only to find a work of genius.  If you plan to watch this film I strongly urge you to not watch the film trailer for it will ruin some of the effect.  A man named Charlie (Nicholas Cage) is hired to adapt a book on orchids into a screenplay while at the same time his twin brother Donald (also Cage)wants to try his hand at screen writing himself.  Donald is confident despite his brothers ridicule and Charlie is in a way jealous of his very socially adapted brother and so our story will begin.  Charlie struggles while trying to write the original interpretation of a book ""The Orchid Thief"" as his brother attends seminars on how to successfully tackle this situation.  As he struggles more and more with this screen play he struggles more and more in reality with relationships business and personal. As he starts to grasp how he needs to approach the writing process his life suddenly starts to blur before him and fantasy and reality start to become one in the same.  This movie is not simply of a mans adaption of a book, but of his life as well as others adaption to reality.  To truly appreciate this movie you truly need to look beyond the actual story line and into the psychee of these people."
583,Adaptation.,,5 December 2003,The best film written by the Kaufman 'brothers' so far...,"Adaptation is about a man named Charlie (Nicolas Cage) trying to adapt a book about flowers into a screenplay. The problem is that there is not story. There are no characters in the book and he is finding it impossible to do. Charlie has a twin brother Donald (also played by Nicolas Cage), who also writes screenplays. Charlie is frustrated by is brother because he writes 'easy' scripts, that don't take much effort and thought, and Donald is getting good results, while Charlie is working day and night and reaping nothing.Nicolas cage does a great job at playing both Charlie and Donald, they both have very different personalities and personas and Cage pulls it off.The story may sound a bit dull, but it is not, it is a great story, you will know what I mean after you have seen it (I don't want to give away anything). This is the sort of film you walk away thinking about, you will try to make sense of it and will want to find out more.Overall, this film is a must see for everyone. If you liked Memento or Being John Malkovich you will love Adaptation. 10/10"
584,Adaptation.,,27 November 2003,A misunderstood piece of genius by Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman,"*Possible SPOILERS*While I won't go into so much detail as other commentators here have done, I think the movie deserves a special mention as to why it seemed so ""random"" to seemingly every critic at imdb.com.The movie certainly isn't for everyone, in much the same vein as 'Being John Malkovich' isn't, but Jonze and Kaufman create another mind-bender here in what is possibly more complex than that of Malkovich, although when taken at face value could be seen as somewhat shallow.However, that is where the beauty of this film lies. The movie is the continual progression of script that Kaufman himself writes. The film isn't about orchids (despite being based on the book 'The Orchid Thief'); it is about Kaufman's life and his struggle with creating this script. However the script is a living breathing process and as Kaufman grows so does the story. This is why I feel a lot of the meaning of this film is lost on most. The action segment of the film isn't a random addition that was just bolted on, it is a result of the help that brother Donald (whose own scripts certainly entail their fair dose of traditional Hollywood action) and the result of where Kaufman is mentally with the script. Indeed in his own words he states ""I don't want to cram in sex or guns or car chases or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcome obstacles to succeed in the end. The book isn't like that, and life isn't like that, it just isn't."" yet this segment contains every piece of this due to the anxiety of Charlie Kaufman and the involvement of Donald.
In fact, in what is perhaps an even more obvious indication of this is the point in the film where Charlie attends the lecture his brother attended in order to sort through this block he has encountered. Throughout the film up to this point we are subjected to voiceover by Kaufman giving us his thoughts on each and every situation, yet when McKee yells, ""...and God help you if you use voice-over in your work, my friends! God help you! That's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character."" the voiceover abruptly stops until the very end of the movie, and is thus acknowledged by Kaufman's ""I don't care what McKee thinks"".This is indeed the very point behind the movie. It contains many elements, but none of them are random. The film is seen as a thought process and once that is realised then the true enjoyment of the film can be found. Those heralding praises at this movie without truely understanding that may have missed the point entirely and those claiming it is boring - well as I said before, this isn't for everybody. Those who can look beyond what is placed on screen and enjoy the incredible depths of a movie should certainly find this one of the greatest (and most thought-provoking) movies of the last decade."
585,Adaptation.,10,16 November 2003,One of those movies,"SPOILERSOnce in a while, a film is made which affects you in a way that hours afterwards, your still sat, obsessed almost, by the shear magnitude of what you've witnessed. For the vast majority of it, this film is one of this rare breed.""Adaptation"" is about that very word. It concentrates on the lives of the Kaufman twins (real life Charlie and his fictional brother Donald), played with genius by Nicolas Cage. Charlie is a balding, fat ""loser"", who manages to make practically every situation awkward. Donald on the other hand is a flirtatious layed back kind of person who enjoys life and seems to represent both what Charlie hates and what he wishes he could be. Both brothers are writing screenplays during this film, Donald a thriller called ""the 3"" and Charlie an adaptation of a real life book called ""The Orchid Thief"".It's hard to know what to say about this film really. It's a moving story of Charlie's pathetic existance as he feels more and more useless. His first lines in the entire film are a voice-over stating how awful his life is and how he's a complete mess. His emotions don't improve much until the very end of the film. It's strange attempting to analyse the character really. In a way, it feels incredibly subjective, as a lot of the time, most of us feel this hopeless and I know personally I feel sympathetic connections to Charlie.This film is something which deserves genuine praise and it deserves an enourmous review about how wonderful it is. The problem is that no matter what I could write, I could never do the majority of this film justice. I say majority because I do confess that for a short period, it does seem to go off on a completely different angle, before returning to pattern for a beautiful finale. For this small section, it is questionable why it went this way, but even in a moment of almost action film type activity, it still fits in truely moving moments which touch the heart.I'm not going to say anything more about this movie. It's easily one of (if not the) best films of the last five years, and if you haven't seen it, make it your top priority. Pure beauty in film is something rare, so embrace this example. Superb."
586,Adaptation.,,15 November 2003,Two-thirds of a great movie,"Wow, was this different and clever and thoroughly enjoyable to watch...until about two-thirds of the way through, when the plot just heads off in a ridiculous direction. It's almost as if Mr. Coppola (whoops, sorry, that's Mr. Spiegel) got lazy and just tacked something on. Very disappointing, especially after the wickedly good set-up."
587,Adaptation.,,9 November 2003,A Film for Everyone,"I expected Adaptation to be a very boring film, after all, it's based on a book about flowers, `The Orchid Thief,' by Susan Orlean.  When the film started off with Charlie Kaufman, I already knew the film was going to be different.  When he spoke in the beginning, he is comical and grabs the audience's attention with his negativity and insecurity.  The story is about a man overcoming obstacles in trying to make something so boring into something interesting, while in the film he is also making something that could be so boring into something interesting.  He adds everything into the film that popular films obtain, action, romance, drugs and comedy.There are so many reasons to go and see this film.  First off, I have never seen a movie like this one.  I have seen movies that are autobiographies but none that are as exciting and confusing as this one.  This film is unbelievable in the way that Charlie Kaufman uses all genres to attract every audience.  He uses his appearance and anxiety to make the film comedic, he adds action in the ending of the film, they use drugs in the film and he has romantic interests in the film, every element is there. While adding all of these elements, he still manages to add the book into the film. If you like films that are confusing, Charlie makes you think while watching the film; I wasn't sure what's real and what's not real.  He used fiction in the film to add more conflict, excitement and to raise questions. He creates a brother to be an alter ego and he makes up stories about the author, Susan.  Is his brother, Donald, real in the film or does he play his imagery double?  Donald only shows up in the film when Charlie needs help with the screenplay and he shares with Charlie how he could make the story interesting.  Is Susan really in love with John or is she there because she wants to feel the passion that John feels?  In the film, Susan longs for something other than the everyday life, she gets that from John.There isn't a lot to dislike about this film but I found Adaptation jumps around and is very random.  I don't like flashbacks; I want everything to happen in order in a movie.  There are flash backs which consist of the book.  All of the flashbacks in the movie are about Susan and how she wrote her book and her research.  The film is also very random which comes from adding all of the elements to the film.  There are so many events that occur in Adaptation that all of the sudden something random and out of the storyline happens.  It seems that he just grabbed a whole bunch of events and threw them in order with ridiculous ways of connecting them.All of the Characters in the film bring something to it.  Charlie, being the main character, is the most complex and the most watched.  Donald accents his personality by showing his alter ego.  As a team, their conflicts make Charlie's life more interesting.  Nicholas Cage portrays Charlie better than any other actor could.  I could not see any other actor playing the role of Charlie and being as good as Nicolas Cage.Adaptation is a film that everyone should see.  It's unpredictable and this movie has something for everyone.  If you go see it I guarantee there will be some aspect of the film for you to enjoy."
588,Adaptation.,10,7 November 2003,Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman have done it again...,"One of the most original movies (in that post-modern sort of way) since Being John Malkovitch. It combined reality with fiction in a way that has rarely been done before. Filled with satire and irony, while still maintaining an emotional appeal. I also thought the direction, acting and script were all excellent. **** out of four stars."
589,Adaptation.,10,27 October 2003,The Finest Screenplay of All Time?,"WOW!Never before have I been as 'knocked out' by a screenplay as I was with ADAPTATION. Charlie Kaufman is, quite simply, a genius, And it's possibly the most ridiculous travesty in the history of the Academy Awards when he failed to win 'Best Screenplay'. What an absolute joke!ADAPTATION is a transcendental masterpiece. A work of art. It is in equal parts hilarious and poignant. It features a plethora of wonderfully crafted, multi dimensional performances, primarily:NICOLAS CAGE who as Charlie and twin brother Donald effectively conveys two different personalities seemingly effortlessly. What a skilled actor he is! Where was his Oscar?MERYL STREEP Who I simply ADORED as Susan Orlean. Eyes that contain the sadness of the world. Beautiful, hypnotic voice-over sections where the poetic, lilting timbres of her elegant voice just wash over you like music. And then she plays stoned and is, quite simply, wet-your-pants style HILARIOUS. Three words: DIAL TONE SCENE. And what a thoroughly beautiful (gets more so year by year) woman Meryl is. I cannot imagine anyone else more perfect for this role. Who stole her Oscar? Why yes, it was the much less deserving Catherine Zeta Jones of course!CHRIS COOPER who despite greasy hair, questionable dress sense and no front teeth made me fall hopelessly in love with him by captivating me from beginning to end with his funny, warm, quirky portrayal of John Laroche. And seeing him and Meryl together was the rarest of joys and had me running back to the cinema to see this incredible film another 4 times. His Oscar temporarily restored my faith in the Academy.
Yes some have balked at the ending - but if one looks closely enough (repeated viewings are advised) it becomes clear that looking beneath the surface of this phenomenally intelligent film is essential. Is Donald even real? Is the ending real? Who do we believe? So many theories, so much debate --- all proof (to my mind) of an absolute work of art and one of the finest films OF ALL TIME. ADAPTATION is seriously wonderful. If you have ever written anything and agonised over it, if you have ever been unhappy, if you have ever doubted yourself, if you have ever wondered if there is something missing in your life, if you have been in love, if you have been out of love, if you have a pulse --- YOU NEED THIS FILM IN YOUR COLLECTION. I end by thanking ALL INVOLVED in the creation of a masterpiece that will stay with me forever. What a film this is!PS - Oh, and do we think THE THREE could work?!?!"
590,Adaptation.,10,9 October 2003,Pulls the rug out from under your feet with nearly every scene.,"I was thoroughly manipulated, and enjoyed every minute of it.  This film is beyond smart and quite beautiful.  Kaufman exposes beautiful, ugly, and comedic aspects of human life with equal grace, all the while continuing to mess with your head.  The acting was powerful.  Personally, when it was over I was dying to know how all the details of how it came about, and how much of it, if any, was non-fiction.The worst part of this movie was that they never went to the chorus of the Turtles song, Happy Together."
591,Adaptation.,5,28 September 2003,Just another lifestyles of the rich and whining...,"This film was decent enough but really nothing exceptional.  Folks, this isn't the first time a writer or artist has put himself into his work, so don't act like it is.  Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a story about really struggling people who don't have Hollywood mansions and accompanying trust funds to fall back on trying to write a screenplay or make a movie.  Do these scenarios exist? Shallow, bitchy, self-absorbed people who suddenly have epiphanies really don't make for compelling film-making.   But, when I think about it, what else can one expect from a ""director"" who is heir to the Spiegel Catalogue fortune.  Nepotism and cronyism at its most flaccid, but still enjoyable in parts.  And, as usual, Streep is wonderful and Cooper certainly deserved his Oscar."
592,Adaptation.,,24 September 2003,"Adaptation is so, so, so bad - here's why.","I loved Being John Malkovich, but I hated this movie.  On the surface it is just 2 hours of rambling from this really annoying character who hates himself.  An average scene in the movie has him standing or sitting saying `I'm fat, I'm ugly, I'm stupid, and I'm fat and I'm stupid, and I keep sweating, ..' FOREVER.  But when you think about the movie more deeply, it is even worse.It is pathetic to make a movie about a guy that wants to make a movie. This is what idiots do when they try to write something for weeks and then say `Hey, I'm going to write about a guy like me, that sucks and can't think of an idea -  people will love that!'.  To make matters worse, not only in the main character trying to make a movie, he can't do it.  Why?  Because he's fat, stupid, etc. etc. etc.  Sound exciting?  It gets better..There is another story in this movie.  It is about a woman who has no passion.  So we get a change of pace with this story.  Instead of hearing `I'm fat, I'm stupid' we hear `why don't I feel passion like the flower guy? I wish I could feel passionate.  Oh, my life sucks.'  Now the movie is called Adaptation, so she adapts to this problem by getting stoned and staring at her feet.  And, the film builds to a climax when she makes a dial tone by humming simultaneously with another person.  This was definitely the highlight of the film.Now wait, it turns out that the woman IS passionate about something after all: her reputation.  You see her first response to someone finding dirt on her is: KILL HIM!  Oh yes, let's shoot him because he saw me having sex! I am in awe of this brilliant plot twist.After that, the movie continued to become more and more stupid until end.Now, for those that think I didn't understand the film: think again.  I get that the film was adapting to what's popular which means that the narrator was changing to become like this brother, blah blah blah.  But it was lame. Really, really lame."
593,Adaptation.,,23 September 2003,A Waste of Two Hours,"Very disappointing... the Oscar nominations that this film received led me to believe it was worth renting, but I found myself laboring to finish watching the whole thing. Not much of a story here, no real point to it in my opinion.Supposedly it's about screenwriting, but it hardly touches on the subject ofscreenwriting at all except for one scene in a lecture hall. If this movie shows how screenwriting is actually done in Hollywood these days, then it's nosurprise that Hollywood screenwriting is a lost art form. The f-word is sprinkled all over the screenplay of this movie, to fill in when they couldn't come up with any real dialogue. Nicolas Cage overacts throughout - Cage did the wholewhining-loser act to perfection in ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" so can't he let that whole persona go now? Meryl Streep took a big step down by accepting a role in this - Streep must have needed to build an addition to her house, otherwise whywould she have bothered to sign on to this. The only character with anypotential interest or originality is the orchid hunter in the Florida swamps, played by Chris Cooper, and he acts it well, but that character isn't fleshed out or given enough screen time. Instead we have to endure more scenes of Cage'smuttering and whining in voice-over. There is a lot of pseudo-philosophicalgobbledygook about people feeling passion and about organisms adapting tothe world; there are too many shots of printed words on the screen as thosesame words are being spoken; and the editing of this film jarringly jumps back and forth in time with no real point to the jumps. I thought that style of editing was finally proven a failure by ""The Last Emperor,"" wasn't it? At one point in ""Adaptation"" Nicolas Cage's character makes a comment like ""I'm just glad tohave this over with and move on to something else"" or words to that effect. This made me laugh out loud because, that was my own feeling exactly at thatmoment. I'm curious as to why so many people seem to find this film ""gripping"" or ""fascinating"" - people must have very low standards of what is fascinating these days. If you want to see a movie which takes place in the Florida swamps, rent ""The Yearling"" with Gregory Peck instead, or if you want to get in touch with nature and see how people or plants adapt to the world, just take a walk in the park or a zoo or a botanical garden for a couple hours, or if you want to feel passionate about something, go out and help someone who needs help,instead of sitting in your living room watching these sad-sacks wallow in their own muck. What have you gained by watching this stuff?"
594,Adaptation.,10,14 September 2003,A Different Kind Of Adaptation,"Adaptation is an amazing adaptation of the novel The Orchid Thief. But in this movie it's telling a story about Charlie Kaufman writing the screenplay to this movie which you are watching.This movie is a great comedy yet it does have a little drama. The funniest parts are Charlie's brother Donald and John Laroche which is played by Chris Cooper. Nicolas Cage plays both Charlie and his brother.I had a lot of mixed feeling when I heard that I was going to this movie and a man who is trying to write an adaptation of a book about flowers. But everything was great after i saw this masterpiece. I suggest this movie very much to many people.Rated R What I think it should be rated and why: R for language, some sexuality, some drug use, and violent sequences."
595,Adaptation.,10,16 August 2003,Great flick...How'd I end up in it?,"I love the device of putting himself and his fictitious brother in the story. Very inventive and imaginative script writing. Jonze also shows he is a great director. The acting was perfect, Cooper deserved the award he received. I'm never going to make a good script, all the good ideas are used up! : )"
596,Adaptation.,10,8 August 2003,Warped. Bizarre. Genius.,"OK, this film isn't going to appeal to everyone. Self-referential in the extreme, it toys with screenwriting convention like a cat with a small furry animal: tosses it up in the air, takes a few token swipes then walks away bored...This isn't so much a movie as a cryptic crossword puzzle, laid out on a grid designed by M.C.Escher. A common complaint is that it is too clever-clever, too self knowing. I can understand this view, but feel that it misses the sheer glee with which the interconnecting stories are told - of John Laroche, the orchid thief, of Susan Orlean trying to tell Laroche's tale and discovering herself in the process, of Charlie Kaufman, trying to adapt the tale of Susan Orlean's struggle to - well, you get the idea. Yes, the continual disruption of the narrative flow by flashbacks, dream sequences and the bad influence of Kaufman's filmic twin brother make this a difficult movie to summarize, but that doesn't make it bad. Viewed as an assemblage of moving pieces that somehow all work together despite giving the impression of imminent collision, it's hard to deny the mad beauty of this film's mechanism.Spike Jonez' direction is strong - the 'flashback' scenes with Laroche and Orlean (effectively the real adaption of Orlean's book) are touching, effective and beautiful, the special effects sparing but visceral, the scenes with Kaufman move from banal to hammed as he attempts to write himself out of a hole. Bravura performances from the principals help as well, but this is an ensemble piece - actors, writer(s) and director, all dancing to the same disturbed (yet strangely compelling) beat.For me, a rare 10/10. Your mileage may vary..."
597,Adaptation.,5,6 August 2003,After the first hour its crap!,"The movie starts out really well. What the hell happen? It went from serious and reflective to cheesy and lame. The entire ending should have been different and not what the screenwriter Kaufman says in the movie he tries to avoid when writing. Watch the first hour but from the time Donald interviews Streeps' character, wish you don't see the rest. Big deal he wrote the screenplay for Being John Malkovic. That was highlighted way too much and added nothing to the film. BTW Kaufman's other screenplay he wrote too Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was not good..."
598,Adaptation.,9,8 August 2003,"Offbeat, sourly quirky comedy of dazzling proportions.","After the success of `Being John Malkovich' Spike Jonze has followed up with another dazzlingly surreal, utterly original and sporadically baffling picture in the form of `Adaptation.'. I guess you could call Mr. Jonze a lite alternative to David Lynch. You have to hand it to directors and scriptwriters when they take the most original approach to the simplest subject. And from an overhead view, `Adaptation.' is one long in-joke from start to finish. The plot takes on many turns, each as original as the next. It's part satire, part dynamic comedy, part Greek tragedy, part quirky drama, part psychological thriller, all weird. What an original concept- a scriptwriter tries to adapt book entirely about flowers while experiencing writers block, being annoyed by his twin brother, and falling for the author of the book who had an affair with `The Orchid Thief' of the title.
This is all tremendously symbolised on the front cover as we see Cage's head in the form of a flowerpot crashing to the ground. Like `Being John Malkovich', this is too surreal for all tastes and is too perplex for an average audience. Some will think it's too weird and completely miss the point. It's certainly an odd cinematic experience, but there are a few laughs along the way. Mind you, many of the in-jokes about script writing and the film industry will pass over the heads of most people.
The performances are exceptional all round from a talented cast. Nicholas Cage is exemplary in a double role as neurotic, world-weary Charlie Kaufman (who ironically wrote the script) and his fictitious dim-witted twin brother Donald. From what I've seen, he deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor. Meryl Streep delivers a deliciously frothy comic turn as real life novelist Susan Orlean, though the late in the game revelations don't justify her character. Chris Cooper (who won an Oscar for his part) gives such a convincing flamboyant turn as Orchid Thief John Laroche, it's hard to believe this is the same actor who was such a stereotype in `American Beauty'. Fine support is generated from Brian Cox, Tilda Swinton and Cara Seymour.**SPOILERS** While the first two thirds build up to, what was hinted at as, a superb final third, the conclusion lacks all logic. The fact that they turned Orlean and Laroche into `the bad guys' really is a disappointment to an otherwise excellent movie. And when they killed off Donald and Laroche, things got even worse and surprisingly bleak. However, there are rumours circulating that that was all just part of the `script' and `the movie within the movie'. I sincerely hope so **SPOILERS END**.
But the film ends on an innovative note as we see flowers blooming in the background and hear the song `Happy Together' playing. In typically idiosyncratic fashion, the lyrics `Happy Together' are repeated as the background changes and the flowers die and re-bloom, but the song never reaches the chorus. This is another symbolisation for the fact that the Jonze/ Kaufman team always end a film on a delightfully surreal note. Wickedly entertaining, glintingly innovative and shockingly audacious, `Adaptation.' is a hoot. My IMDb rating: 7.6/10."
599,Adaptation.,6,6 August 2003,Self-contradictory,"I am really, really disappointed with this movie. It started SO right, with the flowers and the odd guy and everything - Nick Cage at his double best, Meryl Streep so much Meryl Streep, the flowers guy so natural - even the meeting with the sell-out screenwriter is sort of touching - and then they say ""never, ever get a deus-ex-machina to end your movie, try to get the end consistent with the rest"" - AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IT FLUNKED! With a crocodile-ex-machina... Sorry folks, 8 that far, 4 to the final trickery, so average a bare 6. If you care, see my comment on ""AI"" - at least *i* am consistent with myself."
600,Adaptation.,7,4 August 2003,The Philosophy of Adaptation,"These are just some general themes I noticed when I saw the film; I like to notice the philosophical and cultural references when I see a serious film, and this one abounds.1. Success is NOT the result of any notion of Perfection: The film does everything WRONG in filmmaking. It makes ALL the mistakes - self-analyzes; mixes styles even to the extent of incorporating new styles in the the third act that were not used in the first two. This adds up to the moral imperitive of post-modernism: We can do things differently from what's expected as long as it's our intention and we desire the consequences.
2. The film makes fun of PEOPLE and the making fun of so many real-life people is also a joke on a different level: Besides Kaufman making himself the ""victim"" of this movie in more than one way, the film makes fun of Orlean (the original author, the real victim of the screen ADAPTATION), Laroche (Orlean's victim), and even Robert McKee (on a ""meta""-level). McKee is a teacher who's ideas are in some ways opposite from Kaufman's, but in others is similar: he stresses character over structure. His inclusion here helps symbolize that ideas and theories are NEVER Truth; everything needs to be challenged, even one's own preconceptions.3. Don Kaufman is invented to teach his brother (and anyone else who might be listening) that Perception is not Reality, that you can only trust your OWN Actions, Thoughts, and Feelings.4. The major reference in this movie is to Kaufman's namesake and role model: Notice that Darwin is shown WORKING.5. The character John Laroche has the curse of the Autodidact - needing to go off 45% into a new direction to order to reproduce the highest level of excitement possible from learning (from turtles to mirrors to fish to orchids), and leaving behind any chances of achievement from ""suffering out"" difficult times in a single field. This idea of the freedom and opportunity behind autodidacticism shows why it is sexy, but also betrays a tragic, sad side.6. There is a retort by Orlean to Laroche about Adaptation, which can be boiled down to: That Memory begets Guilt. It can also be added that Guilt may only be expurgated by making a Choice. Kaufman shows this in the choice-making of Charles Kaufman and Susan Orlean (even the wrong choices) and in the behavior-modeling of Don Kaufman.7. There is a lack of persistant ""good-guys and bad-guys""; natural selection is at work here. This is actually the ""engine"" of many excellent stories nowadays.If philosophically ""hip"" movies which are also entertaining tend to last over time, we can expect to see this one around for quite a while."
601,Adaptation.,9,5 August 2003,Felliniesque,"This is the second Spike Jonze movie I've seen (the first being, naturally: ""Being John Malkovich""). A really wonderful and Felliniesque Movie.In Being John Malkovich the ""gate"" to Malkovich's head was in the 7 1/2 floor of an office building. A coincidence? Or a deliberate nod to ""8 1/2"", I tend to think of the latter. Now THIS movie has a much closer relation to Fellini's 8 1/2. In fact, Fellini's movie spends most of the time on a Director not being able to start a movie. In this case It's a screenwriter not being able to adapt a book about flowers to a movie.But Charlie Kauffmann has a TRULY split personality. So split in fact, that he's actually twins. Nicolas Cage does a wonderful job in both roles.What's really hilarious (and many viewers haven't got the joke) is that when Charlie Kaufmann 1 takes the screenwriting classes, the whole tone of the film slides from cinematic purity to weekend popcorn muncher. That was really wicked.A fantastic film. A 9/10. Perhaps even a 9 1/2!"
602,Adaptation.,10,2 August 2003,"Excellent, entertaining, suspenseful","I really enjoyed this movie. It was interesting trying to figure out whether Nicolas Cage's character had a double personality or really had a twin brother. I liked the way the movie had a prolonged climax, at times you may get restless watching this film, but overall it is worth it.  It made me buy the book Orchid Thief"
603,Adaptation.,10,27 July 2003,Brilliant and Captivating,"This is a brilliant story of internal conflict at it's best! Not only did Nicholas Cage give a brilliant performance, but he truly brought out the qualities of a self-paranoid ""loser"" who is fighting an internal struggle against his own self-image. This movie is greatly cast, filmed, and presented. It is a must see in my opinion, a definite 10/10!"
604,Adaptation.,10,21 July 2003,Movie about making a movie...,"If you like ""Making of"" documentaries and movies about making movies, you'll love this.  If that kind of thing doesn't interest you, you'd probably want to skip it.This movie takes some getting used to.  If you pay really close atrention to the first two acts, the third will make a lot more sense... as you see the movie turn in on itself you see all of Kaufman's script ideas, good, bad, and indifferent, thrown onto the screen.This is a real love/hate movie, either you'll instantly love it, or instantly hate it.  If you liked ""Being John Malkovich,"" you'd probably enjoy this too.I loved it.  Though I had to see it a second time to really ""get it,"" as it were.  It makes a lot more sense the second time, kind of like seeing ""Sixth Sense"" the second time where you pick up on all the clues that lead to the suprise ending.And to those who mock the ending as cheap, well, you're missing the point, it's SUPPOSED TO BE that way, that's the whole joke.  You'll hear Kaufman mock the very elements he ended up having to use in the first two acts."
605,Adaptation.,8,6 September 2003,Chris Cooper should be in every movie.,"The first time I saw this movie, I was somewhat confused at the end.  I liked it, but I was confused.  After thinking about it for a while, and the entire situation surrounding the movie, I realized how genuinely genius this film is.  Though it's not THAT complicated, thinking about it too much might give you a slight tumor.  Constantly thinking about the actual story, and the movie, then the actual story, then what actually happened, then what was written into the movie... it goes on and on.  I didn't like Being John Malkovich (Maybe because I was told it was a hysterical comedy.  Maybe I just have a tumor and can't tell the difference between good movies and bad movies.  Who knows?), but this movie was definitely worth it.  Chris Cooper's acting is spectacular, and Nicholas Cage was, to my surprise, very good also.  I didn't think he could play this kind of character accurately. Rent this movie, then go buy it.  Why?  'Cause Chris Cooper needs to make more movies where he's missing teeth.  That's why."
606,Adaptation.,10,15 July 2003,Adapt or die.,"I don't think a lot of people get this movie. Meryl Streep once again flashes her genius talent and leads thisstory by the tag line from NYC to a FL swamp, with all the aplomband comic grace of a brainy modern Lucy Ricardo. Hint for those lost viewers: The NYC hotel room where thebrothers come together is where this turns into an all togetherdifferent movie. Hint #2: Even with all the post modern angst piled up, it's just amovie."
607,Adaptation.,,12 July 2003,Could have been great - totally a waste.,"What happened to this movie?  What began as a beautiful story with excellent characters was totally lost when Spike apparently decided that metaphor, nuance and well scripted insight had no place in film.  In a 15 minute sequence, the characters' struggles were eliminated by ridiculous action sequences that had no bearing on anything.  For those who saw it, that whole sequence in Miami could have been cut and (a) nothing would be lost and (b) it would have ended up being a great movie.  The direction of the film in the last 30 minutes totally ruined the purpose and the quality of the film. What a waste - I give it one star."
608,Adaptation.,4,11 July 2003,"Too, too precious.","What a disappointment.  A movie about the difficulty of writing a screenplay.  Who cares?!What's worse, a fine book (The Orchid Thief) is cheapened and discredited by being shown as a tale of adultery.The actors (except Cage, who's in yet another whiny role) are good - pray they get a better script next time out.  Or even a real script."
609,Adaptation.,10,4 July 2003,Highly Recommended for avid fans of Meryl & Nicholas.,"MammaMoon and I watched this film twice, back to back. We loved the script, the acting was superb. Meryl Streep surprised us with her candid portrayal and Nicholas Cage was fantastic as usual. Spike Jones was interesting in his use of close-ups and experimental filming..he needs to work on his lenses and nature filming. We suggest this film highly."
610,Adaptation.,,2 July 2003,Greatest movie in a looooong time,"It has been a long time since a movie as well done and thought provoking has come out like this one.  The first part of the movie (up until Donald Kaufman takes over the script) is filled with beautiful writing, beautiful images, and shows all of the genius and skill of Charlie Kaufman.  The last part of the movie, is the funniest half hour of film i've seen since super troopers.  The rediculousness of the final moments of the movie are not to be believed!  They're to be enjoyed for what they are!  A slap in the face to the conventional hollywood movie.  I love this movie more than my own sister.  Would watch it again and again.  I can only dream of having talent like Kaufman."
611,Adaptation.,8,28 June 2003,Wild Orchid,"Director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kauffman already did the memorable 'Being John Malkovitch'. This film is as good as BJM, and different. In a way, 'Adaptation' starts where BJM ended, with the screenwriter Charlie Kauffman as the main character. He is signed to write his next movie, which is an adaptation of a true story written by a New Yorker journalist about a Florida orchids illegal poacher. The problem is that the screenwriter goes through an artistic crisis, partly derived from the fact that the true story does not seem to provide too much film substance for the script to stand by itself. He is also a neurotic, over-weight, woman-inhibited guy. He has a twin brother who is quite his contrary, and he will soon take an important part in the movie and in his life.The script is the best I have watched lately. I usually do not like too much films derived from the exagerated inside look of Hollywood on its own teritory, but this one works because the three circles of story subject, film and reality are so well inter-mingled that the viewer almost asks himself at a moment where he is in all this! Also, this is one of the few films where off-screen narative voice works well. The story has a different ending that you would expect, which I will not reveal. Let me just say that in my view, the message it tells is that cinema art has its logic, and trying to build 'reality films' cannot make real art. You need a Hollywood ending to make a good Hollywood story, and here you are.There are a few flaws which prevent the movie from being a masterpiece. For example, one would hardly expect the scriptwriter of BJM to mix anonymously in the audience of a scriptwriters seminar! Nicholas Cage and Meryl Streep are as good as you would expect, but not better (sorry, but the threshold for them is too always set very high!). Again, a different film, and a good one. A film to remember, a film that makes you THINK. 8/10 on my personal scale."
612,Adaptation.,8,19 June 2003,Brilliant,"***1/2This is an extremely intelligent and original movie. At times, it's amazingly funny and at other times it's sad and sweet. There are many twists and turns, but they aren't just used for the sake of confusing the audience. They are usually brilliant and add to the overall story. All the actors are great and the screenplay and directing are top-notch. The only problem for me is the ending. While I admired it, I didn't appreciate where the characters ended up."
613,Adaptation.,5,21 June 2003,"It's postmodern, but is it entertaining?","I hate to disagree with probably everyone (critics as well as other users/reviewers), but I did not find this film to be satisfying. Clever, yes, but entertaining? Well, . . By now, most of you know the premise: a screenwriter attempts to adapt a book about orchids and an orchid thief. Orchids are not exactly the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters, so the screenwriter runs into a big wall. What results is a film about the writing of a film about the writer's attempt to adapt non-dramatic book into a film. Very self-referential and postmodern, to be sure. For me, the movie fell apart in the third act when the screenwriter's journey took him completely off the map and into new territory (departing wildly from plausible reality in order to spice up the story). Without spoiling any surprises from the last act, I found the departures into criminality and violence, from what was previously an intellectual tale, to be phony. Also, I never felt as though I spent enough time with any of the characters other than Charlie (the screenwriter) to care about them. They were still rather flat and, well, stock. That and the unreality of the final act worked together to make me aware of a movie trying harder to be clever than it tried to tell a story. You see, as soon as you call attention to the medium in which you're working as part of your story, so that the act of telling a story itself becomes a thing used to prove a point about storytelling (or something like that), you've left art and entered academics. And well, academics is fine, but it isn't entertainment.Certainly, many screenwriting rules can be broken successfully. But this movie doesn't actually do that. Instead, it only pretends to break the very rules it ends up obeying, though in a rather dishonest fashion. The rules that it does break in the end are those of honest storytelling. Sure, you can fabricate something to spice up a story, but do it honestly.So, putting yourself into your own screenplay is all very fun and clever and postmodern, but I have the feeling that postmodern storytelling is a trend that will not last long, if it isn't in fact dead already. Eventually, dramas that create real characters we can care about will take over again to win the critics' hearts.Still want to see an entertaining postmodern film about filmmaking and scriptwriting that is self-referential and pretends to break the very movie-making rules it is secretly obeying? See Robert Altman's The Player. Now that's entertainment. . ."
614,Adaptation.,10,20 June 2003,AHA! Moment,"I have figured it out! There are two distinct types of viewers who dislike this move. One, the folks who insist on way over-analyzing and over-intellectualizing films, and two, individuals who want basic entertainment and don't want to have to think to get it. Both ends of the spectrum seem to be almost insulted by this movie on some level.I, for one, really enjoyed this! It truly appealed to both the ""Charlie"" and the ""Donald"" in me. I was very impressed by Nicolas Cage's performance. Meryl Streep was also in fine form. I always enjoy a film that makes you think and this did a fine job.There is a lot more I could say, but I think anyone who enjoys a little harmless mental exercise as part of their entertainment should check it out and see for themselves."
615,Adaptation.,10,15 June 2003,staggeringly brilliant,"Before seeing Adaptation, I never really believed there was such a thing as a brilliant film. The great movies I had seen - take Braveheart for example - were movies I felt that I or my friends could have written. To me, a great film was one in which a decent story had been successfully embellished with cinematography and special effects - subjects I knew nothing about.By testifying to the existence of genius in screenwriting, Adaptation has deepened my love for the medium of film. Charlie Kaufman exhibits staggering narrative wizardry and an uncanny ability to integrate presumably disparate experiences into his story. He ties together his subplots so adroitly that even recognizing them as ""subplots"" seems forced.But doesn't Kaufman's way of finally having Charlie and Susan interact seem a little clumsy? Of course! The scene at the nursery, and the film from that point on, is a clever homage to the style of Donald Kaufman. We are supposed to believe that Donald had a hand in writing the screenplay, too, remember?The exquisite structuring of Adaptation is not all the film has to offer, of course. There are real insights here, of both the ""so sweet it makes me tear up"" and ""so acridly honest it makes me squirm"" varieties. Particularly engrossing for me was the examination of what passion means and what it means to be passionate.Adaptation has brilliant things to say, and it says them brilliantly. This is one of the greatest films of all time."
616,Adaptation.,,17 June 2003,Interesting but flawed...,"Adaptation is an interesting, immaculately performed, but ultimately flawed movie which tries to subvert the nature of movies by constantly altering in style and genre. Watch it go from light comedy to dark thriller before your eyes! Watch Charlie Kaufman make changes to his script which then alter the movie itself. Some neat tricks, well acted and often quite brilliant, but leaves you in the end with a feeling of disappointment."
617,Adaptation.,,12 June 2003,It's easier than you think...,"Gosh, it's hard to write about a film. You have to do all this stuff...like maintaining a theme, and holding your audience's interest, and making a clear case for your opinions. You need to take vital parts of the film and interpret them and transfer them to the printed page...and that's pretty daunting, to tell the truth. Perhaps I should write about oranges instead, and maybe somehow this will be a unique and exciting way of writing about the film. Because, after all, oranges are deeply symbolic of just about everything. No, that's pretty difficult too. Hmmm ... another idea ...(can you guess what it is? I'm doing it *even as we speak*)...I'll write about how bloody hard it is to write about a film. Aren't I clever? This way, nobody would dare to suggest that I have nothing to say, because, well, I'm being *self-referential*, and that's ... you know ... *postmodern*. Ooooh! So, here I am, writing about writing about a film. This is fun. Except ... I'm not sure what to do next; there's only so long I can go on this way (or is there?) so maybe I'll have to write about the film after all, or you'll all get bored and go read a book or something. Hmmm. Think, think. I know!!! I *will* write about the film ... but I'll do it in such a tongue-in-cheek and obviously ironic way that I'll look very clever indeed, and I'll make you (Dear Reader) feel clever, too, because we'll be sharing a cosy little postmodern joke at the expense of the Establishment, which will look all bewildered and go home and watch Kindergarten Cop.Ah, the hell with it."
618,Adaptation.,,12 June 2003,"What an interesting, strange little movie.","This is the partially true story about Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt a book into a screenplay.  His twin brother Donald tries to help him. Donald writes screenplays too, but crappy ones.  The thing is, everyone thinks his brainless screenplays are gold.  This causes problems, as Charlie is a genuinely great writer.  He also tries to break down the wall that stops him from connecting to other people.  Both Kaufman's are played by Nicolas Cage.Man, was this a good movie.  I think it's kind of weird that the real life Charlie pretends he has a brother named Donald, but hey, whatever makes him happy.  The performances here rock.  Streep is one of the best actresses i've seen, and I love the way she plays her character.  Chris Cooper was a man I already respected, but this made me respect him more.  And before this, I didn't think much of Nicolas Cage, but now I see that he is a real actor and not just a celebrity.  It's also interesting that Cooper lost weight and Cage gained weight for their roles, they both looked a lot different.The direction is great as well.  I love the cuts to Charlie's daydreams, they flow so good with what's really happening.  The alternating scenes of Charlie brainstorming and how the Orchid book was written are good as well. Kaufman has a strange talent; I hope he never stops writing."
619,Adaptation.,10,12 June 2003,Thoroughly enjoyable and thought-provoking!  You will love this movie!,"Who says there aren't any good movies coming out anymore?!  Adaptation is one of the most intriguing and above all enjoyable films in recent years. This film is excellent for its wonderful satire and poignant observations of life.  Writer/Director Spike Jonze far surpasses his previous effort Being John Malcovich (1999) which was most certainly one of the most thought-provoking and original films in recent memory, yet was not altogether gratifying as an enjoyable movie-going experience.  Adaptation on the other hand, has all of this and more.  Spike Jonze (undoubtedly drawing from personal experience) presents the plight of the shy screenwriter Charlie (Nicholas Cage) so realistically that I couldn't help laughing hysterically since I could relate to his writing woes and often to the relationships he has with others. The contrasting writing styles of Charlie and his twin brother Donald are humorously included and illustrate how differently one can define and create a `good' movie.  The tone changes later in the film, adding to the unpredictability of the plot, yet without detracting from the overall experience. No, this is not a boring film about the triumph of the human spirit.  It is smartly written and thoroughly engrossing and captivating from beginning to end.The life lessons Charlie learns throughout the story alone are worth viewing the film to discover for yourself.This is essential viewing whether you are interested in filmmaking like me or if you are looking for a film that will offer insights into life and leave you feeling enriched long after viewing the film.     My Highest Rating!  *****"
620,Adaptation.,10,13 June 2003,Truly excellent film,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is unexplainable - and that is part of why it is so good!  It is just so realistic that I can't even describe how I felt sitting in the cinema watching it.  I love Nicholas Cage in this movie and I have to say he was robbed at all the major award ceremonies. Similarly, why didn't this movie win best screenplay?  It was a lot more original and creative than 'Chicago' which was just taken from the stage musical (plus 'Moulin Rouge' was a lot better and came first and Baz Lurhman wasn't even nominated for Best Director- Did those judges even SEE IT? ROBBED! that just goes to show what a big advertising budget can do for a film)  Anyway, back to the point.  Kaufman's script blew me away.  It was honest and I found that I could easily relate to the characters, their insecurities and their struggles.  Although a lot of people complained about the ending (the film just changes direction suddenly) I thought it was good. It was, for me, unpredictable and that is rare in movies these days - any days really.  While it may be a bit too different for some, this has become one of my favourite movies of all time.  I rate it around the 9-10/10 mark. I loved it and when it comes out on DVD here, I am going to buy it!  Great cast, great script and just a good overall vibe.  SEE IT!"
621,Adaptation.,7,8 June 2003,"""true"" story","[Vague spoilers in this review]This is probably the most intriguing movie I've ever seen. It is certainly the only movie that I can recall that has inspired me to follow up about it on the internet.Simply put, I was curious, after seeing the movie, to know how much of the story was ""true,"" and how much was fiction. The fact that this curiosity was so overpowering that I actually went to the effort to research this film makes it positively extraordinary. (Negatively extraordinary? I've got other things I should be doing!)To save others some time, I thought I'd let you know what you may have already discovered (PROBABLY have discovered, if you're actually taking the time to read through these reviews): Charlie Kaufman (the scriptwriter) ain't tellin'.Presumably, the majority of the movie is based on actual events (particularly Kaufman's struggle to adapt the very real book ""The Orchid Thief"" into a script and his subsequent decision to document these troubles in the script itself) right up to the 'beginning of the end,' which I shall define as the moment when Kaufman's twin brother Donald (the only obviously fictional element of the story apart from the ending) meets with Susan Orlean (the real, living author of ""The Orchid Thief,"" played by Meryl Streep) in NYC.It is the ending of the movie that apparently turned off many viewers. While I originally was a little turned off by the abrupt genre change myself, I take issue with those who thought that Kaufman was attempting to make fun of the provincial movie-going masses or that he was attempting to hide the fact that he didn't know how to end an otherwise sublime script by parodying Hollywood.I think he was simply being honest. (And for what it's worth, Kaufman said in an interview that he didn't intend to parody the film industry.) He made singularly clear in the film that he didn't know how to write the script, how to adapt the book, how to end it. So he just followed (real-life scriptwriter/speaker) Mckee's (fictional?) advice about giving the audience what it wants. I don't know that Kaufman should be considered a genius for his 'solution' of writing himself and his struggles into the script, but it definitely made the movie different, and his honesty (assuming he was indeed honest about his struggles and intentions) makes for a uniquely ""true"" story.Besides, in retrospect I'd argue the ending is both entertaining and appropriate. The film is billed as a comedy, and it is comical (if disarming) to see Streep's sudden character change to save her precious New Yorker reputation. Other melodramatic elements work just as effectively. The car crashes in the film are shockingly violent. Chris Cooper earns his Oscar for carrying out the difficult task of being simultaneously low-brow, charming, arrogant, ridiculous, philosophical, and touching (all the while making it look natural) as the real-life orchid thief John Laroche was found to be by Orlean. On the whole the excellent cast is natural and believable; Nicholas Cage plays polar opposites Charlie and Donald with aplomb. Some may consider the profound message Donald leaves Charlie with as ""cheesey,"" but that's some darn good cheese. And for those who still don't like the ending, consider this: how ironic is it that Kaufman follows Mckee's advice to ""wow them in the end,"" and the movie has precisely the opposite effect Mckee predicts... audiences are wowed by Kaufman's highly original script throughout much of the film, disappointed by it's over-the-top ending. I'd say that proving Mckee wrong makes for an appropriate ending to this movie.If you're not a fan of movies that are ""different,"" you're probably not going to be a fan of this movie. But perhaps you should see it anyway. Unlike others that have critiqued the film, I don't think it strives to be different (as Kaufman's previous effort, ""Being John Malkovich"" seemed to do), I think it only strives to be ""true"" in a very unique way, and that's why it works so well."
622,Adaptation.,,6 June 2003,"The movie Adaptation is about..... well, adaptation.","POSSIBLE SPOILERSAs a rather neat recap, let me quote from certain film festival literature introducing this movie: self-referential it ceetainly is but self-reverential it certainly isn't. Adaptation is about a writer writing about himself trying to adapt a book to a screenplay. There is a good mix of real and fictional characters, as well as real and fictional events, making the movie a little confusing. The easiest way is to treat the whole thing as fictional, and the confusion disappears like a headache would after a proper dose of aspirin.Adaptation has often been compared to Being John Malkovich, and it is indeed the film makers' intention that such a comparison be made, with the opening scene showing the BJM crew at work, including Malkovich himself. Truth of the matter is, Adaptation is no BJM, in fact, a far cry from it.The brilliance of BJM is evident in two things: its soaring, boundless imagination and its broad and deep coverage of many thought-provoking issues under the umbrella of humanities. Watching BJM, you are so continuously amazed by the situations and ideas being thrown at you that you can hardly catch you breath. Leaving the cinema, you take away so much with you to chew on. Adaptation is nowhere near it. That is not to say that Adaptation is not a good movie. It's just that BJM is so superbly brilliant. Anyway, enough of this irrelevant comparison.Despite what seems to be an abundance of sub texts, Adaptation is actually simpler than what it appears to be, or wants to appear to be. It's essentially about a writer's frustration, particularly in the situation of trying to adapt for a screenplay material previously published in another media. Underneath a surface of what seems to be avant-garde, Adaptation is actually quite conventional. There is the big question of the meaning of life. There is the brooding, introvert writer extremely self-conscious of his imagined obesity and baldness. There is the story of unnounced and therefore unrewarded love.The twin brother Donald's significance is often exagerrated and mystified. Besides the obvious role of the other persona that Charlie wants to be, Donald has another equally obvious role, the sounding board for Charlie to act against, like the clown is to King Lear. He is also useful for the development of the ploy, but is wisely not over-used (e.g. Donald going as Charlie to see writer Susan Orlean, a useful situation wisely not allowed to develope into the cliche of identity confusion). As a stand-alone character, Donald is not particularly colourful. Interesting though that he talks about shattered glasses as a motif in the screenplay he is writing. The image of himself doing just about everything lying on the floor is sort of a motif of the absurdity of this character.The other story line in the plot, dealing with the relationship between author Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) and subject ""orchid thief"" John Laroche (Chris Cooper), starts out looking quite interesting. However, the irony here is that what seems to be the intended irony doesn't quite work out. The sex, drug, car crash, shootings....all these things that Charlie Kaufman (in the movie) scorns becomes not just part of the final script in the movie (which is the intended irony), but also part of the movie that was actually made and watched (which is not an irony). What started out promising to be reasonably inspiring ended up with conventional Hollywood written all over it, including the riding-off-into-the-sunset-a-reborn-man cliche of a finale.The high point of the movie has to be the excellent cast, down to the minor supporting roles: Charlie's agent, Donald's girlfriend, Laroche's Indian assistant (the one fondling Streep's hair) and the cute waitress.Tilder Swindon and Cara Seymore delivered solid performances as Valerie the producer and Amelia the would-be girlfirend respectively. Brian Cox is more impressive here as MeKee the charismatic lecturer than as the villian General Stryker in X2. There's some good acting in his playing the accessible and helpful man behind the persona of the bullying lecturer.Chris Cooper undoubtedly deserves his Oscar but watching him, my attention sometimes got diverted to his missing front teeth. I know that Gary Sinise didn't saw off his legs for Forrest Gump. But in my ignorance, I thought maybe Cooper actually had his front teeth removed because at the time he was shooting the movie he was also going to perform in a Christmas concert anyway, singing ""All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth"".Finally, Streep and the two Cages well deserve the praises that have been heaped on them."
623,Adaptation.,,6 June 2003,I didn't adapt well to this movie,"This movie was fun to watch for Chris Cooper.  He does a great job and it's interesting how Meryl Street eventually fall in love with this Orchid collector with no teeth.  Nick Cage has a few goods to deliver in this movie.  Overall though, it wasn't the best."
624,Adaptation.,9,8 June 2003,Comedic Masterpiece,"I just watched this film again for the second time last night, and, while the repeat performance wasn't better than the first, the first was so incredible as to make up for this.  The film has a fresh novelty all around it, a style of humor that is unlike any other film I have seen, including Being John Malkovich by the same writer and director.  It is intensely self-reflexive and self-referential, and at once it is a comedy, pokes fun at itself, parodies its own genre, becomes a film of the genre it purports to despise, and parodies that!  A real screenwriter wrote the screenplay for this real movie, and this movie is about a screenwriter writing a screenplay and failing, and ending up writing himself into the screenplay.  And guess what he's doing in THAT screenplay?  Referring to himself as if he were writing a screenplay!  Confused?  Well see the movie--there are certainly jokes where it takes about 10 seconds to register since the film is such a hysterical entanglement of levels.One thing that was rewarding on the second viewing was appreciation of the score, which maintains the same tune throughout the film and yet is mutable, changing from the contrast-laden and intriguing music of an intellectual film to the understated but mood-setting Hollywood scoring of an action film.The acting is noteworthy.  Meryl Streep does her part well, if not spectacularly.  Chris Cooper on the other hand, ""is such a fun character"" (hehe).  Nicholas Cage is just phenomenal, playing two distinct parts so well that you never confuse them even though the characters look so similar.The cinematography, dialogue, acting, and scoring, however, are not only good on their own merit; they are infinitely better as a result of being a satire of these same attributes in other films.  *SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT* It begins as an intellectual and self-important drama, much along the lines of American Beauty.  The film is exactly as Kaufman (in the film) wants it to be (not artificially plot driven, just ""being"").  As his character in the film finds the need to change, not only does he change, but the characters in his screenplay change and the movie (Adaptation) itself changes character.  This type of humor makes the film hilariously self-aware.  The entire movie is a character in its own right who makes fun of other films. While most dramas which follow along the same lines as this film in its first half are self-important, they lack the self-awareness of this film which makes it unique.  This is an ""intelligent film"" in the truest sense!Almost precisely halfway through the film, it becomes what at the start was Kaufman's nightmare.  This is where the film gets out-of-control funny and breaks all the rules.  The contrast between the twins works itself out brilliantly, and the cliche-ridden second-half of the film is non-stop laughs because of how it was discussed and treated in the first half of the film.  Not only this, but the fact that it is such an accurate parody of action flicks with its dramatic scoring and moralizing lessons and car chases, also adds to the humor.  And who can forget the Deus ex Machina?? It not only breaks all McKee's rules but also all of Kaufman's, ending in the most trite way imaginable--only it is exactly this triteness that makes it seem not cliche but genius, because of the way the film manipulates viewers and is aware of itself (also breaking McKee's rules).While all the aforementioned aspects of the film (score, cinematography, acting, etc) are all remarkable, it is the structure that is unimaginably and intricately *brilliant*.  The first time I laughed uncontrollably throughout, the second time I appreciated many of the finer details, and I would recommend this film to anyone not afraid of slightly bizarre movies and somewhat knowledgeable about film. [10/10]"
625,Adaptation.,,7 June 2003,Crazed brilliance,"Charlie Kaufman should be running Hollywood. ADAPTATION is a work ofsuch offbeat,lunatic genius that I sat in stunned delight while watching it,thinking,""Yes...THIS is why I love the cinema."" Nicolas Cageconvincingly creates two different people in Charlie and Donald,andtheir ideas and creative problems were extremely familiar to me,as an artist."
626,Adaptation.,,7 June 2003,***** out of 5,"Finally someone, somewhere has dawned a piece of fictitious realism that is so honourable to life that words seem too scarce to describe it. I could say that this is a film adaptation from the book Orchid Thief's, a book about... well, flowers and a man who will kill to find them. It substitutes for moral grounds of fascinations and a dangerous reality that exists within that paradox. Orchid Thief's was a non-fiction book by author Susan Orlean and her and he fascination with the fascinated John Laroche. Laroche is a man who will con, sneak and lie his way to success in order to fulfill himself, a man bent on flowers and striving to understand their motivation in life. But just as you think you may have the story to this film figured out, I will bet you don't. This is not a movie about flowers, it only intents to be. It is not about searching, rather finding and the characters above mentioned serve no other purpose than to delay what could actually be going on. This is where Charles Kaufman comes in. Kaufman, who is best know for writing 1999's masterpiece Being John Malkovich, is assigned to adapt Orlean's book as a film, but during the process suffers writers block and end up writing himself into the film in a desperate attempt to seek change and evoke passion through search. Kaufman also has a twin brother Donald who has nothing in common with Charlie but seems to be finding success in the writing field without even trying to attain it. When it really comes down to it this film is actually about nothing. Nothing is said, nothing happens and nothing is resolved. There are no characters, only fragments of real people in a fictional universe where change is no really the answer, only the question. It is a film that signifies something but never resorts to telling anyone what that could be. I am having trouble even determining whether or not this film even exists. It is a fascinating journey that toys with the sense, empowers the thought of going some where and then toys with that idea as if never presenting it in the first place. I may have no clue about what has happened in this film, but I can only help but wonder if I truly even saw it. I have presented a plot description and mild character break down but haven't even touched what has really went on within the boundaries of possibility. Somehow I feel that this is not a movie, rather a diversion form what we would like to consider fiction in the sense of reality. The reasoning behind this film is astounding. Charlie wants to make a simple movie about flowers, that is what the book is about so why not? He doesn't want romance or character transition. There is no need for guns or car chases, just flowers. The problem is that the book seems to be empty, sure it's a great book, but a movie? He wants to be innovative but true to the author because he fears for her disappointment. This film offers so much to say about life, love, despair and a unwilling search to devour what is not there and truly find a line between reality and the minds ideals, that you can't watch it as a work with something to say. You must consider it to be an extension of yourself, we have all been there before but never has a blurred view looked and felt so natural. The joke in this film is that it is not actually a film, it is a study of a film being adapted from a book that could be a film, but really shouldn't be. It bases what is reality on what it sees through the eyes of its fiction, it is a test, a spiritual guide, one of 2002's greatest memories. And to top it all off the film is funny, hilarious even. It laughs at its despair and so do we not because we want to, but feel we can. Black comedy is a hard thing to do, it is easy to make people laugh at people's actions but how do you make them laugh at real emotions? This film is sad, it depressed me, it made me think about what it didn't want me to realize and then it made me laugh because I knew I shouldn't. This is thanks to the brilliant teaming of Kaufman and director Spike Jonze, who also directed Being John Malkovich. Jonze accents Kaufam's actions by not presenting them, but previewing them, making the audience feel comfortable with their structure but prying on their reflex for more. The end of this film will shock some, astound others, and sicken those remaining, not because of how it is, but because how it is, is questionable towards the closing of the story, or even the existence of it. This is truly film making at its absolute best. Nicholas Cage plays a duel role as both Chalie and Donald Kaufman. He plays them with such emotional representation that we always tell them apart by who they are and not some tick of make-up. Both Meryl Streep as Orlean and Chris Cooper as Lacroche are exceptional in their performances. They both play characters that wish they could be human, but somewhere inside, know that they aren't. There is nothing more to say about a film of this nature, I could spend more time picking apart story characteristics but I'm not even sure if there is a story here to pick apart. Kaufman set out to make a simple film, and he did, there is no more to it than that. I could always talk about the actors and how I loved their performances but they are not performing. Simply they are representing characters that do exist in real life (both on physical and emotional levels). There is a lot left to talk about within Adaptation that I have felt no need to talk about, or saw no need to involve anyone but myself with, but I will say this is a film that disserves to be seen, it practically begs your viewing. In saying nothing it has said more than anything to come out of the works this year. But don't take my word, I don't create emotions, I'm just the writer."
627,Adaptation.,6,31 May 2003,Surprised Me,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this movie until about 3/4 of the way through.Thought provoking and leaves you thinking about the characters and their circumstances long after the movie is over.""You are what you love, not what loves you."""
628,Adaptation.,,29 May 2003,good movie,"this movie was a little slow to start but then after awhile it took off more. i like the people who played all the title charecters( nicholas cage, mereyl streep, chris cooper...) this movie should not be seen by younger children as the rating of R is well deserved. There are at least three scenes of nudity (including a womens chest and a guys rear end) plus there are other sexual situations and the language is pretty raw at times. so parents before leting your younger kids see this movie think about it."
629,Adaptation.,,29 May 2003,Disappearing up one's own bottom...,"Gosh, it's hard to write about a film. You have to do all this stuff...like maintaining a theme, and holding your audience's interest, and making a clear case for your opinions. You need to take vital parts of the film and interpret them and transfer them to the printed page...and that's pretty daunting, to tell the truth. Perhaps I should write about oranges instead, and maybe somehow this will be a unique and exciting way of writing about the film. Because, after all, oranges are deeply symbolic of just about everything. No, that's pretty difficult too. Hmmm ... another idea ...(can you guess what it is? I'm doing it *even as we speak*)...I'll write about how bloody hard it is to write about a film. Aren't I clever? This way, nobody would dare to suggest that I have nothing to say, because, well, I'm being *self-referential*, and that's ... you know ... *postmodern*. Ooooh! So, here I am, writing about writing about a film. This is fun. Except ... I'm not sure what to do next; there's only so long I can go on this way (or is there?) so maybe I'll have to write about the film after all, or you'll all get bored and go read a book or something. Hmmm. Think, think. I know!!! I *will* write about the film ... but I'll do it in such a tongue-in-cheek and obviously ironic way that I'll look very clever indeed, and I'll make you (Dear Reader) feel clever, too, because we'll be sharing a cosy little postmodern joke at the expense of the Establishment, which will look all bewildered and go home and watch Kindergarten Cop.Ah, sod it."
630,Adaptation.,10,27 May 2003,An Original and Unique Film,"ADAPTATIONDirector: Spike Jonze, Writers: Charlie and Donald Kaufman, Starring: Nicolas Cage as Charlie and Donald Kaufman, Meryl Streep as Susan Orlean, Chris Cooper as John LarocheFILM REVIEW:Every once in a great while we get one of those original and extremely strange movies that blow our minds. `Adaptation' is one of them. Only madmen like Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman could come up with something so weird and funny. They were the men behind the extremely great film `Being John Malkovich.' `Adaptation' is one of those films that leave you curious to the point of insanity as it takes twists and turns you never suspect. And as the credits finally begin to roll you finally catch your breath.The film's about a book titled 'The Orchid Thief,' based on a New Yorker article by Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep). The book is about a man named John Laroche (Chris Cooper). He is an orchid-lover that would travel all over the world and literally kill to get a hold of one. Since it's illegal to steal them off protected property he hires Indians to pick the orchids, since it used to be Indian land.Sounds like a simply story...but it goes a lot further than that. Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) is hired to adapt the book into a screenplay. He can't figure out how to adapt the book. He's stuck. There's really no story to the book. There's too much stuff about orchids in the book.Charlie's anger escalates as his not so intelligent brother Donald - who is also played by Nicolas Cage -   sells a script for a million bucks and his producer won't get off of his back. He keeps digging ideas out of his brain until he finally decides to write himself into the script.The whole time during this movie my blood was pumping and my brain constantly kept shooting out ideas that just might happen next. That is one of the reasons this film is so amazing. Anything can happen! During the excellent twists and turns and fantastic acting you get tangled up in its web and get hypnotized to the screen. I couldn't even take my eyes off of it. Besides all its twists and turns, there is something even more that made me love this film: it's acting. Each and every person in this movie gives a great performance. Especially Cage. With his double role as twin brothers I think he deserved that Oscar. No doubt about it. With Charlie you bought him as a lonely and depressed man. You saw the sickness in his eyes and the look in his face that said `Just kill me.' I could actually relate to Charlie. I'm one of those people that care what other people think of me and don't want to be lonely. With Donald he convinced me he was a happy and talented man who wanted to write and screenplay badly. A man who didn't care what other people thought of him. He was the center of this film and if he didn't pull it off the film would have sucked. But he did an excellent job!I think probably one of the best (and funniest) scenes of the film is when Charlie is at a screenwriting seminar of Robert McKee (Brian Cox). Charlie asks McKee what he should do when he's writing a script to where nothing happens in the world. McKee explains to him in a screaming manor (and a few F-words) that it's impossible to write a script where nothing happens. People die everyday, people lose and gain a love everyday. That scene really had an impact on me.Meryl Streep also gives and excellent and convincing performance. She really makes you feel for her as her life falls apart. Especially at the end of the film. It makes you want to cry. Chris Cooper is also great. He won an Oscar for this performance. Something about his character is really interesting. How he goes through different hobbies. And his love with orchids is pure amazing.The film has several great messages. One is Life. It's not a toy and don't take nothing for granted. Also I learned abut Love. I learned how some people can love something so passionately. How Laroche fell about orchids is how I feel about movies.Grade: ADVD REVIEW:I was expecting a little bit more than this. Like director's commentary. Or deleted scenes. That would have been a treat. But we don't. But the good thing is it at least came out as a Superbit DVD. Superbit DVDs have the cleanest and clearest quality. It's beautiful to look at and listen to. The special features are cool but they could have added on a lot more. We get really cool animated menus. On the main animated menu check out the small little ant that crawls across the screen. You can barely notice it.We get some neat filmographies. For the filmography for Donald Kaufman (which I'm not sure if exists or not) it says that `The 3' will be made in 2004. `The 3' is the script Donald was writing throughout the film. We can also get to watch the film with English and French subtitles! Lame! But the thing I like coolest about the film is the trailer. It doesn't give a lot away but it does make you want to see the movie. A fairly decent DVD for an amazing movies.DVD Grade: B"
631,Adaptation.,,27 May 2003,f'in amazing,"on the heels of returning this movie to blockbuster (after watching it twice in as many days) i just HAD to buy it...and i did. ""adaptation"" has got to be one of the best movies i've seen this year and i've seen a crap-load of movies. the great thing about it is that it works on two levels: one as the movie ""adaptation"" starring charlie/donald kaufman, second as ""the orchid theif"" starring susan orlean and john laroche. thing is that while i haven't read the book and am not really interested in commenting on the adaptation's integrity, ""the orchid theif"" part seemed to work better than the other. see, as much as everyone raved about nic cage's performance, i found that he brought little to the table as far as character development and showing the different facets of the kaufmans. this probably wouldn't have been so disenheartening if it wasn't put against the out-of-this-world performances of both meryl streep and chris cooper.kaufman's ""adaptation"" script is self-concious and self-indulgent...and genius. it does everything that scripts aren't supposed to do: point out that they're fiction, that they're just words on paper, and that they don't really exist all the while pretending to be real...genius, fresh. the attitude of the film is another point worth mentioning. maybe it's the script, maybe jonze's direction, but whatever it is, ""adaptation"" has an intelligent, pop culture-concious look and feel.it's ""new"" and it's f'in great. due in no small part to streep and cooper...probably more than any other factor, their acting, chemistry (like making good jazz, cooper said when he accepted the oscar) brings the film to a whole 'nother world of ""f'in great""-ness. this was the year for streep no doubt (with a second amazing performance in ""the hours"") and surely the role of a lifetime for cooper (and he didn't even have teeth!). their work in ""the orchid theif"" part of ""adaptation"" will be raved about in a gazillion years when the dvd gets found by the post-apocalyptic space explorers among some movie buff's other faves...even then, it'll be considered new and f'in great.10/10*"
632,Adaptation.,,26 May 2003,"drugs, sex, and violence","I loved this movie. Like BJM, ""Adaptation"" offers many levels of understanding. Charlie is admonished that the only way he can write a successful screenplay is to use the tricks that work. Snorting lines of orchid, attempted murder, alligator most awful, all live up to that. These cliches confuse us and startle us. Why, this isn't a movie like that! This movie is way deeper! ""We are what we love, not what loves us"". What I like most about this movie, is what I liked about BJM: The writing is way ahead of us. It leads us up the path, turns us around a few times, and then predicts where to meet us after we come sauntering back from the vertigo."
633,Adaptation.,8,30 May 2003,"""It's about *flowers*!""","This is the funniest darn movie about the creative process in recent memory. The ending is a bit of a cop-out (only because I was expecting something *really* insane), but the overall impact of the film makes up for it. Donald lives!"
634,Adaptation.,7,29 May 2003,As different as twins can be,"This is truly an intellectual film and it certainly takes intelligence to hold the script together, but it works. The story is about a script and its author. And the film is about making a film about a film on a book. And it is much more clever done than it sounds here.Nicolas Cage is playing a man with a twin brother. They look the same but have different characters and definitely differencies considering success with women. Cage is making a fine portrait about a loser in such matters. He shows bad timing in the dates, bad rhythm, bad silences. His brother on the other hand knows how to do.Another American film outside the mainstream but still very professional."
635,Adaptation.,,28 May 2003,Australia.,"When I took a copy of this home from work the other night (it's not out on video  and DVD in Australia till like July, video store staff get advance copies) I'm not quite sure what I expected. i'd read good things about the movie, but I still had no idea what to expect.I'd already seen Being John Malkovich, so it was sort of amusing to see scenes from that. As for adaptation but, I have to say that I did enjoy it, and it's quite possibly one of the most original movies I've ever seen.Nic Cage has done a great job of portraying Charlie and Donald Kaufman, and while the storyline did get a bit confusing from time to time, it was still pretty enjoyable.insanely realistic car crashes as well...
7.5/10"
636,Adaptation.,8,24 May 2003,Never Short Of Intrigue(SPOILERS!!),"I just saw this movie, and I want to write about it as soon as possible to make sure it is still fresh in my mind.I liked the over all premise of the movie. It's  a movie about a guy trying to write a movie based on a novel. Hence the title ""Adaptation."" It is directed by Spike Jonze, and written by Charlie Kaufmann who is also a character in the movie. Charlie is played wonderfully by Nick Cage. Charlie is self-conscious, neurotic, and paralyzed by his own insecurities. I found it interesting that the real life Kaufman decided to give himself a twin brother in his own screenplay. This twin brother is also played by Cage. I liked the fact that Cage allows the audience member to notice the obvious differences between the two characters without making extreme choices. He doesn't even change the tone of voice between the two. They are simply two different people. There is a wonderful supporting cast including Susan Orlean(Maryl Streep), the author of the book which Kaufman is suppose to be adapting to the screen. There is Johne Laroche(Chris Cooper), the exentric flower expert who is the subject of Orlean's book.I liked how the plot switched back-and-forth through time showing Kaufman's difficulty adapting Orlean's book and then going back showing Orlean actually in the process of writing the book. If this review seems confusing up to this piont you should see the movie.  I also liked the superb acting. All the actors made good choices but not overacting. The character were all believable.Despite  all that I liked about it the movie had definite flaws. I felt much empathy toward the character of Charlie Kaufman but I was annoyed by his neurossis at times. There were moments that I wanted to slap Charlie and tell him to quit feeling sorry for himself. Also the movie really toyed with me. Pardon the cliche. Just when you thought you knew what the movie was about it would bring you to a totally different dimension. At times the movie felt like it didn't know where it was gonna go. It seemed the movie was just as confused by the plot as I was. The worst example of this was the convoluted ending. Talk about going off into a tangent. I think I watched the whole movie without grasping what the movie was about or knowing its true meaning. Maybe it didn't have any of those things? Maybe I just didn't get it?Overall I liked the movie and I'm interested in what other people think of the movie. It is definitely worth watching."
637,Adaptation.,9,22 May 2003,"very thought-provoking, coming close to a masterpiece","This is the kind of movie that doesn't just aim to entertain but rather to challenge you in a sense that it actually caused a major identity crisis in my life. IT is easy to indentify with Charlie Kaufmann's self-consciousness, the constant self-questioning and the need to impress others, but how? By being other or oneself, or: What is oneself anyhow? Probably the best movie I have seen in a year or so, Adaptation is but a little bit short from a masterpiece that deserved a 10 rating."
638,Adaptation.,5,20 May 2003,Big Debt to Fellini,"This movie recycles Fellini's 8 1/2. Plot is same, movie about making a movie which is the movie you're watching. I expect this is why Fellini is name checked during the movie. Thing is, Fellini's movie is a lot better, if you enjoyed Adaptation then you really should check it out if you haven't seen it. I'm not a film buff, someone gave me the Fellini movie for Xmas, and I was very struck during Adaptation how much was lifted and how little was added to what is in 8 1/2."
639,Adaptation.,,21 May 2003,An eccentric seriocomic foray into orchidaceous dementia,"They've done it again!  ""Being John Malkovich"" director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman are back with another sublimely kinky, surreal tale, this time depicting the intermingling conflicts between three people involved in the adaptation (no pun intended) to the screen of Susan Orlean's ""The Orchid Thief"".  Nicolas Cage (in an Oscar-nominated turn nothing short of brilliant) stars as Kaufman and his fictional twin brother Donald, both of whom are trying to write their own respective scripts, with Donald flourishing and Charlie remaining stagnant due to a series of mid-life crises (e.g. an incapability to approach women) and a case of writer's block.  Orlean (wittily played by the incomparable Meryl Streep, who snagged a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod), a staff writer for The New Yorker, travels to Florida in order to write a story on ethereal, strange, and toothless horticulturist John Laroche (Chris Cooper), whose devotion to plants---orchids in particular---arouses the interest of the usually diffident Orlean.  Soon, Orlean and Laroche's ""relationship"" becomes personal and strangely romantic, which arouses Charlie's interest, leading the story into dark territory with shocking results.  In an time where moviemaking tends to become more and more routine, Jonze and Kaufman are mavericks at creating interesting and outrageous characters that perversely make sense and capture an audience's attention.  If ""BJM"" and ""Adaptation"" are any indication of what to expect from these two genuises, then we shall be exquisitely entertained for years to come.  Cooper's astounding portrayal of the toothless haggard won him a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar and Golden Globe.  ****"
640,Adaptation.,10,15 May 2003,One of the best screenplays ever written.,"This is a great movie.  It is the complete opposite of all current film making.  The acting is wonderful, compliments the genius screenplay nicely. Jonze is an actor's director, but is also a great visual artist. REQUIRES multiple viewings, as all good films should."
641,Adaptation.,,17 May 2003,Lovely & Amazing,"Adaptation is the greatest American film since American Beauty, and in some way, very much like him. Not all people can understand this film. Only people who are having the same conflicts that the main character, Charlie Kaufman (the stunning Nicolas Cage) is having. Then again, I think that there's a little Charlie (and a little Donald) in all of us. He is the by-product of our society. All the fears and doubts that today's society deals with, he suffers from. and unfortunately, not very well. Once again, Meryl Streep plays the middle-life-crisis aging woman with the same struggling emotions, like in every movie she has done in the past few years. On the other hand, Chris Cooper does a beautiful small part as the bizarre John Laroche, that changes obsessions like we change underwear, but has a unique charm, that can't be ignored. Adaptation is the best film of 2003 to date."
642,Adaptation.,9,14 May 2003,What's next?,"A friend of mine said he was convinced that the next Kaufman/Jonze co-operation will be a film called The Three. I don't think so because the plot of The Three as described by Donald insinuates exactly the kind of film Charlie Kaufman dislikes. But on the other hand, the question about what is going to be next is justified. Will there be another sequel`? Can there be? Adaptation. goes really very far in thinking through the Being-John-Malkovich issue of slipping into somebody's brain. I can't imagine it to be made even more complicated.So much about the theory. In fact, I found Adaptation. absolutely brilliant: well-played, well-directed and indescribably well written. However, compared to Being John Malkovich (one of my top 5 films) it loses the competition because it is only kind of a re-imagining of the first film. The genius of Malkovich lies in its simplicity, in presenting a completely new vision and adding more and more ideas around it. Adaptation. re-invites us in the world already created and complicates the ideas already presented. Of course, complicated` is not a negative word in this context. Adaptation. as well as Malkovich are films made for our brains only, not for our hearts. This should be clear to any one who goes to see them.So, as a result of these few thoughts, I give Adaptation. 9 points, while Malkovich got 10."
643,Adaptation.,10,10 May 2003,Shuffle it all,"Charlie Kaufman created a great level of hype when he scripted the strangely engaging story of ""Being John Malkovich"". So, from the next movie by Spike Jonze, what would follow had to be as extreme. And they succeeded. Permanently crossing the border between fiction and non-fiction and then making a fusion between those two worlds, the movie defies structure and already-seen formulas. Here, the screenwriter is the main character, as he struggles to make an adaptation of a book called ""The Orchid Thief"". And the movie revolves around the making of the script you're watching, always questioning what actually happened and what didn't. By the end, your mind will be bent trying to figure if you've been watching a movie or a strange kind of fictional biography, and when they include scenes shot in the set of ""Being John Malkovich"", you won't be able to distinguish film from fact. And this confusion is pure bliss. Unlike anything you've seen before, its script shouldn't have been overlooked at the oscars. A true vision-changing experience."
644,Adaptation.,,5 May 2003,Adaptation,"...What a fantastic film this was! Spike Jonze's is one of the best new feature length directors of today! Being John Malkovich was going to be hard to beat, but you know what in my opinion he's done it! ...This is mainly thanks to the GENIUS that is Charlie Kaufman! This isn't just any writers block movie, it's Kaufman fixing a situation by making his job much better! ...The story of the background to the making of this film goes that Charlie Kaufman is contracted to to adapt Susan Orlean's best selling novel The Orchid Thief. But like the best writers often do, Kaufman struggled to adapt... so he let his mind run free and decided to write about his struggle into an original script! ...The movies first half is a run of the mill guy trying to adapt book but fails. but as the film continues it drifts further into the plain odd! Mainly in the development of Meryl Streep's character!!!Cage is fantastic in his finest role in many years. Yeah, I think Cooper deserved his Academy Award... Jonze and Kaufman deserve more credit for this film!!!9/10 AMAZING!!!"
645,Adaptation.,,4 May 2003,Going in without any preconceived notions of what is going on,"I thought the movie was about a screenwriter journey's in writing the adaption to a book. Boy was I surprised.I was prepared it to be kind of arthouse type and didn't realize the twists and turns that I was exposed to.Anyway, this film is not for those who want something obivous like X-men 2 or Matrix : Reloaded but more for those who prefer to be intellectually challenged.I was really confused throughout the movie until the last 15 minutes or so. I have no idea what is reality "" in the real world "" , or what is reality "" in the film world "", or what is reality in Charlie's head.Is Susan Orlean that lonely/sociopath, is John Laroache a would be murderer, ""no"" in the real world.. The writing just overwhelms me sometimes. I wish I can come out with something intelligent like for the plot of the Three.""The professor eats his victims one piece at a time. He can be called the deconstructionist"" Mervoulously, hopefully one day I can be as witty as that in the right situation and in the right context."
646,Adaptation.,,24 April 2003,Best English language film for about five years.,"You'll have read the story-line on the other user comments so I won't repeat it.This is a film that ends up high-lighting Hollywood's obviousness, whilst at the same time acknowledging its necessity at times.  Though a writer may truly want to be original and avant-garde, sometimes a formulaic ending might be called for.I loved Nick Cage in ""Raising Arizona"" and have hated him in pretty much everything else he has done.  In this film however, he is marvelous.  He plays identical twin brothers and while there are no obvious physical or clothing differences between the two characters, you instantly know which one you are watching by the way he acts them.  Oscar or not; this will be remembered as a fine performance/s.Meryl Streep does her job very well in my opinion.  It's not a performance that sticks in your mind like Cage's does, however, it's not a part that does either.  There is a great scene though where she goes from being a rather conservative character, to a far more loosened-up one.  It had me grinning from ear to ear.Chris Cooper proves that he is an actor with versatility here.  His strict military father in ""American Beauty"" is a far cry from his brilliant weirdo in this movie.  He will bring a smile to your face for some of the time and a lump to your throat at others; at all times however, he is very believable.The other characters all have an impact to the story in some way or another whether it be large or small, though it is the main three who you'll think of afterwards.And how often do you walk out the cinema talking about the script in so much detail?  Okay, by writing himself as the central character to be played by Cage, Charlie Kaufman does this pro-actively somewhat, but it's still an amazing screenplay for its sheer cocky-ness if anything.  Just when you're thinking that it's self-indulgent, he agrees with you by writing a line for Cage to say on his behalf.  Now, I like surrealism and I loved this movie. I can appreciate that it might be a little bit too ""out-there"" for some people's tastes.  I do feel though, that while so much rubbish is being brought to the screen by big Hollywood studios, it is testament to the brilliance of Kaufman's script that this film was even produced.
Credit to Spike Jonze for bringing it to life as well.  I don't know who was in charge of special effects, but you can't see them at play whilst the two Cages are on screen together; that really is superb!If you're looking for something to pass a little time without making you think, then don't watch Adaptation.  If however you are looking for an intelligent, witty, entertaining and at the same time stimulating movie, the likes of which you won't have come across before, then I can't recommend this one enough.  This is an innovative treat!"
647,Adaptation.,,26 April 2003,Charlie Kaufman's Confession,"It was a brilliant concept - the main character in the film, as ascreenplay writer, adapting a book into a film. And the film turnsout to be the film that we (audience) are watching! Not only the idea, Charlie Kaufman did a good job in depicting andbuilding up the four main characters in the 'Adaptation'. DonaldKaufman is a twin brother of Charlie Kaufman but they got totallydifferent personality. One thing can have positive and negative sideand it just depends on which side you want to look at it. Charlielike Amelia but he is too timid to express his affection because hesee himself as inferior person. But Donald is a womanizer and hisgirlfriends are fond of his talents! Susan Orlean (played by MerylStreep) is an all-rounded decent woman but lack of passion downat the bottom of her heart until she met John Laroche (played byChris Cooper) who was fanatic of something, one at a time. Forexample, turtle, fossil, and now endangered species of orchid. Thestories of the four characters interwine when Charlie and Donalddecided to meet Susuan up so as to get the inspiration to finishthe screenplay. Of course the acting of Nicholas Cage x 2, MerylStreep and Chris Cooper are convincing! But this is the turning point - it develops in a melodrama ending -which you won't expect in Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman's film.The beautiful ghost orchid can be drug, the decent, middle classjournalist become drug addict, and there are killings. At the end,the free spirited characters died - Donald and John, and leavingthe normal people adapting and their lives go on. Having such agreat experience in watching the film 'Being John Malkovich', I maysay Adaptation has a disappointing ending comparativelyspeaking. I am not sure why Charlie gave in to McKee'ssuggestion. I hope not Charlie is showing us the hint that he isgiving in to commercial Hollywood's formula. Of course, like 'Adaptation''s tag line, it's about 'one story, four lives,a million ways it can end'. And there's more than a million waysyou can interpret it. For sure it is the film that you cannot find anysimilar one outthere."
648,Adaptation.,10,20 April 2003,A movie about a million things.,"I recommend this movie for people in moods from depression to happy. There's a message in it for everyone. I admire how Kaufman can write a movie about a flower that keeps the audience interested. However, obviously the movie isn't about the flower its about life in every aspect. I just said that for the people who weren't paying attention during the movie for whatever reasons(making-out or waiting in line for popcorn). When you leave the movie I assure you your life will be affected or at least your perspective on life will be different. Message to aspiring actors, stimulated wacking off will get you nomination but not win you an award."
649,Adaptation.,7,22 April 2003,being charlie kaufman,"Its a real rarity today to see movies that so much depends on its screenwriter. ""Adaptation"" is, without a doubt"" one of them. This is completely ""one man show"", and when I say one man show I mean Charlie Kaufman show. For me, Spike Jonze is here nothing more than a vehicle for Kaufman's extravaganza. We can see some very noticeable improvements here than in the first Jonze-Kaufman flick ""Being John Malkovich"". While the first one went all the way downhill after no more than half an hour, ""Adaptation"" stayed strong for more than one hour. And, unfortunately, the last half an hour are again meaningless and ridiculous. Kaufman is obviously a writer that suffers from originality-sindhrome. That shouldn't be wrong, accept in case when that same originality becomes just an excuse for no meaning. Kaufman is full of ideas, but it seems that he doesn't know what to do with them. He lacks philosophical depth and simple rational thinking, and that's why he failed to deliver one more time."
650,Adaptation.,7,17 April 2003,It Works - But Only Just,"If you're going to see a movie directed by Spike Jonez, then you know it's going to be out of the ordinary.Nicolas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman, the screen-writer of 'Being John Malkovich' and this film, and it centres around his attempts to write a screenplay from book written about orchid hunters in Florida.  Whilst he struggles (and fails) to write, his twin brother, also played by Cage, goes to a 'How To Be A Screen-Writer' lecture and ends up writing a widely acclaimed film, adding to Charlie's paranoia and psychosis.The film switches between Meryl Streep's character writing the original book and Charlie writing (or not) the screenplay until the two timelines collide.Cage is excellent, Streep is average and I have no idea why Tilda Swinton is in the film.  OK, she's good, but you spend more time wondering why she was cast rather than concentrating on her character or the film.There are some stunning effects and dramatic sequences, but it's difficult to work out who's trying to be profound: the film or the book.I'm pleased I've seen it, but I won't bother seeing it again."
651,Adaptation.,10,15 April 2003,"Satire, anyone?","Great movie. Almost singularly a laugh riot from beginning to its painfully (and intentionally) formulaic ending. Formulaic ending is generally not a compliment, but when wielded by the extremely adept talent of Charlie Kaufman (note: Donald Kaufman is his fictional twin brother, though dual credation might have you think otherwise) it should be taken as high praise for a successful commentary on Hollywood writing and the lack of originality often seen therein. You will laugh, and you will be strongly moved by some of the dialogue between author and subject, as well as between brothers [you'll see what I mean]. You may cry, although I would be surprised if you were moved to tears long enough to actually shed one. Incredible acting, particularly on the part of Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, and the man who won the Oscar for playing the character of LaRoache (Chris was his first name, his last name escapes me at the moment); and, at the risk of sounding redundant, incredible writing on the part of Charlie Kaufman, who also penned the extremely original and inventive ""Being John Malkovich""."
652,Adaptation.,10,6 April 2003,Charlie Kaufman- The new screenwriting champ?,"For years I have said that I'd put Quentin Tarantino's screenplays up against anyone anywhere, but I'm not quite so sure that I can do that now. Don't get me wrong, when it comes to the total package, screenplays, directing, and just overall brilliance, there isn't a name in Hollywood that comes close. But scripts? I don't know... Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith have serious competition. When a screenwriter crafts something as witty and imaginative as ""Adaptation"", there's little competition that can be deemed worthy.I didn't really think that I could enjoy this, due to twin Nicolas Cages, my most hated actor, appearing in the film. I must admit that he was effective in his role, doing exactly what the script seemed to call for. Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper both did a wonderful job, and truly earned their Oscar nominations (as opposed to merely falling back on the script as I felt Cage did- they added something to their roles). The star of the film however, was clearly the screenplay itself. It's a shame Kaufman is as quiet and mysterious as he is, as it would be interesting to hear his thoughts on his films and on his thought process while writing, in commentaries and interviews. The final act of the film made me appreciate the whole movie more as a whole. One of the best films of last year, and even better than ""Being John Malkovich""... **** out of ****"
653,Adaptation.,10,4 April 2003,Fantasic movie,"Best movie I've ever seen- camera work is fitting, the mood stays put throughout scenes, and the screen play is just simply brilliant. There isn't anything not to like in this movie.. even Nicholous Cage preforms his best (yes, better than Raising Arizona). Be concerned though - you have to be a fan of wierd movies to appreciate this one."
654,Adaptation.,9,4 April 2003,Half of this Review is About Me,"Every once in a while you see a film and it just happens to resonate with you in a way that it wouldn't have had you seen it another time. Adaptation is this way for me. I saw it just as I was re-discovering my love for writing. This newly re-discovered love came back to me as I started blogging.After I first started blogging, a few well-meaning relatives said I should be writing professionally for newspapers or something. While I would never consider this, as I don't think my writing is good enough, and I've got other things I'd rather do, it did force me to think about it for a minute or two, and after that minute or two I realized why I wouldn't want to write professionally ... deadlines.That said, there are two other aspects of writing that go in the `pro' column with the first being the process of exorcising thoughts in one's head into words on a piece of paper (or computer screen). There is something almost therapeutic about articulating something you really believe in, into written words. While, this process is wonderful unto itself, even if no one else ever reads it, it is also extremely validating to have others read and appreciate your work (that being the second pro).So with all that bobbling around in my head, I came to see Adaptation.The film confronts the difficulties a writer faces with balancing what the writer wants to write, versus what the audience wants to read (or view). The conflict a writer faces of wanting to be true to one's ideals while also seeking the acceptance and validation from the audience embracing his work. And of course there's the aspect of dealing with the `real-world' of deadlines, bills to pay, finding love, etc.The film is directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie (& Donald) Kaufman, the same director/writer team that brought us Being John Malkovich. BJM had to be one of the most original, absurd, and entertaining films I've seen in recent memory. Adaptation achieves a similar standing, but in a very different way. The film is a wonderful mix of autobiographical non-fiction, with a quirky piece of fiction, mixed in with an adaptation of a real non-fiction book. Confused? Well it is confusing, but somehow Kaufman (& Kaufman) make it work, in a way that could have just as easily flopped big time -- but it didn't; it paid off -- big time.I'm tempted to describe the film in detail, but it really needs to be experienced first hand. To sum it up, it portrays the struggle of Charlie Kaufman in his struggle to adapt the book ""The Orchid Thief"" into a screenplay. He ends up making the script as much about his attempt to adapt the screenplay, as it is about the story of the book, and we soon realize that the script he is writing, is the film we're watching. It works on so many levels one could write a Masters Thesis about it, but all of these levels leave the audience captured, waiting in baited anticipation of how they are going to resolve themselves. It truly is a symphony of a screenplay with all of these themes working beside one another, and ultimately resolving themselves when they come together in the finale at the end. In many ways (that are hard to describe without giving it away), the film is like a combination of Fight Club and Get Shorty. Though Charlie would disapprove of such a movie-industry-pitch type of description.
The cast is fantastic, and while I have never been a big Nicolas Cage fan, he demonstrates the brilliance of his craft here.Bottom line: 9/10"
655,Adaptation.,,7 April 2003,Bonkers  a one-off,"SPOILER ALERT!Basically, this is a film about a screenwriter struggling to adapt anon-fiction book into a movie. OK so far. Except that we're watchingthat very movie. Also, the book (though not all of its revealedcontent), its author, the eccentric guy who's the subject of her bookand the commission to adapt it are all real. A real-lifescreenwriting guru appears, too, but they're none of them playedby the actual people (though one *character* insists he gets toplay himself 'in the movie'  and that *actor* got an Oscar for thepart!)Add excellent performances throughout, some horrific shocks anda big list of movie-script clichés that Nic Cage  brilliantlyportraying very different identical twins  insists in the first scenesthat he will *not* end up writing into the film(!) and you have a trulymind-bending couple of hours. For the most part engaging, inplaces hilarious, but, overall, just very clever-clever.As a neat footnote, Adaptation's BAFTA award and Oscarnomination for best script adaptation (though it's not really  butthen, given the premise, how could they include it in an 'originalscreenplay' category?!) were shared by the real screenwriter whohas fictionalised himself and his fictional twin from the film, whileCage was Oscar-nominated for playing them both."
656,Adaptation.,8,6 April 2003,well done!,"Well done! That's the sentence I have on my mind when I think of this film...this very good film. The central idea is excellent: a screenplay writer lives the difficulties in turning a book into a movie. His story is beautifully told while we also watch the life of the writer of the book and her relation with the man the book is about. The movie has a kind of time travel, as we see past and present happening very fast.Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep are great, as always. Chris Cooper, who got the Oscar for this role is also very well. my rate 8/10"
657,Adaptation.,8,6 April 2003,This is not merely an Adaptation,"In a time where it seems that all movies are destined to be a re-make or a film version of a novel, comic-book, TV series, etc., ""Adaptation"" comes to the rescue and restores your faith in expecting something great out of an original story.Although the title itself contradicts my very point, ""Adaptation"" is nowhere near being such a thing. The movie is about it's own writer, Charlie Kaufman. A man whose quest to adapt the book ""The orchid thief"" takes him instead to writing the story of 'how' he attempted to adapt it. So, as you see, they might tell you the screenplay is based on ""The orchid thief"" but it's not at all. The book is more like a starting point. The movie is all about Kaufman.So, as the movie progresses you find yourself watching the very same images that Kaufman is describing in his screenplay. It's kind of watching the painter painting himself painting that same painting. And I absolutely loved this approach.Nicholas Cage absolutely transformed himself to become Charlie Kaufman... and his brother Donald. His performance is very touching being the desperate Charlie and the lovable Donald. By the time you find out there is actually no Donald in real life, you wish there was. Great performances also from Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper, playing the writer of ""The orchid thief"" and the man who inspired her.I really hope there are more films like this done in the future. It think ""Adaptation"" is a very interesting, intimate and sincere story about overcoming challenges and becoming the person you want to be. (Feb/03)"
658,Adaptation.,,30 March 2003,"Well adapted, Mr. Kaufman!","It seems rather ironic, an adapted screenplay narrating a writer's inability to produce an adapted screenplay. Yet, this screenplay has been hailed as one of the smartest this year, and has rightfully been awarded an Academy Award nomination. Indeed, the film's main advantage is its plot. It is an extremely intelligent trip through a writer's job, who faces the usual : writer's block. Charlie Kaufman seems such a fascinating character, his ideas, beliefs and talents intrigue the audience. Beautifully directed, the film leads the audience to utter agony about the outcome of Mr. Kaufman's frustrating attempts to all directions, and the most wonderful feeling of all at the end, the pleasure of creation. Truly spectacular performances by the lead actors add to the general feeling of perfection that surrounds this movie. Nicholas Cage delivers in the lead role, both as Charlie and his identical twin brother Donald Kaufman. Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper (Academy Award winner for his role as John Laroche) are also flawless. The theme of flowers can be quite confusing throughout the movie, yet in the end it becomes clear and it is binded perfectly with the theme of the movie. That is what makes the movie so brilliant. The adaptation of the book is very successful at the end, Charlie (and Donald?) Kaufman has managed after all to put his dreams, his ideas, his wishes into this screenplay. This is the ideal film for everyone who's interested in all the conflicts and ordeals an artist has to go through before he delivers what gets eventually known to the wide audience. My sincere and delighting congratulations to Mr. Kaufman for bothering to deliver a masterpiece of such class and beauty. We are grateful."
659,Adaptation.,7,27 March 2003,Very different movie--and quite good,"I finally got around to seeing ""Adaptation"" today and it was about as good as could be expected.  Though by no means a perfect movie, it has a great approach, excellent acting, and arresting direction from Spike Jonze. ***SPOILERS*** But the real reason I wrote this was to gripe about the ending.  For the first hour and 15-30 minutes or so I was consistently laughing out loud at Charlie's self-deprecating humor and getting very involved with the story of the orchids themselves.  However, when the film descended into being every cliche that Charlie talks of loathing in the first scene of the movie (e.g. turning the orchids into drugs, having a car chase, concocting a flower heist, characters learning something about themselves or their lives), I found myself wishing that it was all just another fantasy sequence which would soon end so that we could get back to the real story.  Of course, I do realize that this is the joke:  that Charlie must resort to these tired Hollywood cliches in order to find an ending to his story.  But this joke is only funny for about 5 minutes, and then I want to go back to the movie that this started out being.  I left the theater asking myself the same question that Charlie asks:  ""Why can't there just be a movie about flowers?"" I've read a few of the comments on this movie, and none have mentioned the ""deus ex machina"" that Brian Cox's character mentioned.  Even this, too, was included by Charlie--in the form of the alligator attack!"
660,Adaptation.,10,23 March 2003,Why can't there just be a movie about flowers?,"This movie was fantastic.  It was written so ingeniously that it makes me want to cry in jealousy of Charlie Kaufman.  I did not really understand how much I liked and respected this film until the day after I viewed it, and even then, many things had to be pointed out to me by a friend and other things I read.The movie is about the writer of the movie trying to adapt a book about flowers into a movie... about flowers.  The trouble comes when he just cannot do it.  He realizes that there is not enough drama in the story to create a movie that will catch the consumer's attention.  The plot develops from this, but there is also a different story going on at a different place in time.  Susan Orleander, the writer of the book to be adapted, is interviewing and getting to know Laroche, the subject of the book she will write.Nicholas Cage is fantastic as an end-of-his-wits writer (Charlie Kaufman), suffering from a low self-esteem.  At the same time he is playing Donald Kaufman, twin brother to Charlie, who does not exist in the real word. Donald Kaufman is an aspiring screenwriter who is living with and looking up to his brother.The two brothers are very different, and it's surprisingly easy to tell who is who considering the fact that they look exactly the same.  One is fairly negative towards himself and others, while the other is a pretty happy-go-lucky, hopeful guy.Chris Cooper gives an equally (or half) good performance as Laroche, a southern work of white trash, whose love of Orchids and Ghost Orchids makes him stand out.Everyone one of the actors and actresses does a fantastic job working with one of the most innovative and crazy scripts in the history of the academy.However, the star focus of the film is Charlie Kaufman (both the writer and the character, who is a writer as well.  Confusing.), who has created an ingenious screenplay and story.I would recommend this movie to almost anyone.  If you can't handle thinking much about what's going on, don't see it.  I know my father didn't enjoy it.The movie is, how I earlier described it, ingenious and amazing.  It got its deserved Oscar nominations.  If only it had received a nomination for Best Picture as well.10/10"
661,Adaptation.,10,22 March 2003,Brilliant Nicolas cage is very talented!,"i thought that Adaptation was a very different film at first i wasn't really getting into it but by the middle i loved it. The ending was fantastic and Donald and Charlie Kaufman and very talented people as is Nicolas Cage. The film wasn't what i expected and that was a good thing. I say make more films like it , it was brilliant!!!!! Well done!"
662,Adaptation.,,22 March 2003,"Did you ""get"" it?","Yet another ""quirky"" creation from the mind of Charlie Kaufman.  In this film Kaufman portrays himself as a tortured, blocked writer when in reality he was justifying his vandalism of Orleans' book.  Rather than risk a true adaptation of someone else's work, the film devolves into the usual rambling mess of the ""weird"" and the ""kooky"" we have come to expect from Kaufman and Jonze. I saw nothing wrong with the Meryl Streep/Chris Cooper segments in the beginning.  The story and dialogue showed some true depth and I found myself getting into their story. So what possessed them to deviate so hideously?  The movie turned into one monstrous commercial for Kaufman's supposedly disturbed psyche, a ranting monologue aimed at convincing us that Kaufman is one ""weird"" fellow. And the worst part is that it wasn't the chaotic, random journey into darkness that's portrayed in the film.  It's calculated weirdness.  It's planned wackiness.  He notes all of the shortcomings he plans on committing early on and then pretends it's irony rather than sheer laziness. But well-advertised and well-known facts disguised as clever little inside jokes give the viewer a warm fuzzy feeling when they ""get"" the gag.  You'll chuckle to yourself, lean over to your date, and say, ""You know, that's true!  Charlie Kaufman really did have a hard time adapting Susan Orleans' book!""  The whole movie is like a 90-minute movie version of ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" without the snotty interviewer."
663,Adaptation.,10,20 March 2003,genius,"Adaptation is a movie of one in a million intelligence.  The last film that I've seen that analyzed and overanalyzed to this point may have been Being John Malkovich, Jonze and Kaufman's last film together.  Kaufman is the most creative, truly gifted screenwriter of our time, and Jonze weaves the story thru pictures with ease.  Adaptation is most definitely the film that stands out in my mind from 2002.  A fantastic revelation.  A beautiful vision of passionate people who all handle their passion in their own wonderful ways."
664,Adaptation.,,18 March 2003,Growing Pains,"This is the most self reflective film I have ever seen, and leads me to the conclusion that all the characters were metaphors for different elements of one man's mind. My interpretation is that what the writer is exploring is growth and adaptation of the mind to the world and situations that we find ourselves in. Hence the numerous flirtations with Charles Darwin's natural selection and also the alteration of species to suit their environments.I thought the humour was brilliant - particularly the confusion on Nick Cage's face when ""Charlie"" is told not to use voice over. Talking of the acting, Cage is fantastic at separating his two elements of the film. Perhaps that is one of the points of the film - even though nature superficially dictates things as identical, in reality chaos theory does not allow this.Really liked this film and will be musing it for many hours, will certainly watch it many times."
665,Adaptation.,,18 March 2003,An outrageously grandiose accomplishment: a masterful film about itself!,"If you thought ""Being John Malkovich"" was weird, chances are you'll find the follow-up collaboration between pop video whizkid director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman even weirder, making this proposed adaptation of Susan Orlean's non-fiction best-seller ""The Orchid Thief"" one of the most bizarre films ever financed by a major studio. For starters, it's not really an adaptation of the book, but rather about the adaptation of the book: this is in fact the story of how screenwriter Charlie Kaufman attemped to write a script adapting Susan Orlean's book and of the mess he gets involved in while doing it. And yes, Kaufman has written himself and all of the real-life characters around the story - Orlean, her subject and orchid-obsessed horticulturalist John Laroche, screenwriting guru Robert McKee - into the story, then has them played by actors and makes them do stuff they never actually did in real life, and invents himself a twin brother who is also credited as co-writer of the finished film. All of this while contemplating the difficulties of adaptation, both in its evolutionary sense and in its Hollywood sense of translating a book into film; ""Adaptation"" is probably one of most self-obsessed and self-absorbed films ever made - it's a film about its own making - and yet it is an absolutely engrossing study of that one spark of human creativity from which any sort of emotion - hence of art - evolves. Needless to say, it's a pain to explain in writing what the film is all about, but you follow it pretty well on screen thanks to Jonze's effortlessly clear direction. In fact, Jonze replies to the script's chinese-box self-referential structure by simply shooting it straight-forwardly, letting the momentum take care of it. However, its more cerebral tone (this is, after all, a story about a screenwriter's block) means it's a bit more heavy-going than ""...Malkovich"". Nevertheless, it's an outrageously grandiose accomplishment: Jonze and Kaufman actually pulled it off. One of the most original and enjoyable major-studio films in recent memory, and a field day for cinema theorists."
666,Adaptation.,10,16 March 2003,Comments as interesting as the film,"The reactions to this film are as interesting as the film itself.The comments I have read really highlights to me the many ways in which people can interpret it. What I see here is a film that is astounding in that it as so many different angles and dimensions.I'm not writing a long comment; There is a enough critical acclaim and comment here already.I would however, like to ask one thing to those who commented on the 'shallow' ending. Have you considered the possible implicity of this? To me, the sudden change in tempo, the decision to kill Kaufmann, the impossibly contrived aligator attack and sudden death of his brother is completely intentional and shows an incredible depth of thought.It really is an amazing film, which, without descending to the depths of technical merit (how good the CGI is etc.) is incredibly difficult to criticize, without unintentionally praising it at the same time. Stunning."
667,Adaptation.,8,14 March 2003,"Adaptation.-8/10 is a superbly inventive, funny and poignant film...","Possible SpoilersAdaptation. is a superbly inventive, funny and poignant film about life, love an screenwriting, from the creative team of Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman who brought the amazingly, original 1999 film Being John Malkovich. This follow up really shows how genuinely original and great these two are. Instead of a story about a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich...this time we get a portal into the mind of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman in a matter of speaking. Nicolas Cage plays Charlie...he's fat, balding, ugly and sweats a lot. He is obsessive, shy and kind, and coming off the success of Being John Malkovich ,which has some nice behind the scenes sort of stuff, he has been asked to adapt a book called The Orchid Thief by Susan Orleans played by the wonderful Meryl Streep. The trouble with this is that he can't find an original way to adapt the book. ""You can't make a movie about flowers!"" Unfortunately for Charlie he lives with his twin brother Donald Kaufman also played by Cage. Donald is the complete opposite of Charlie, cocky, self-confident and without originality. He also is writing a script...a by the book serial killer thriller that naturally follows all conventions and formulas and of course is a hit with Hollywood executives. I will say that Nicolas Cage's perfomance in this film is absolutely astonishing in creating two completely different characters who are both look a like and are equally likeable. It's an amazing feat that you can always tell them apart eventhough they look the same. Charlie's dilemna leads him to find out more about author Susan Orleans and the a man the book is written about. That man is John LaRoche played by Chris Cooper in a fine performance, who on the outsde seems nothing more than a redneck hick living in the swamps of Florida, but there is a lot more to him than meets the eye. Susan also sees this and they develop a strangely hipnotic attraction to each other, while she was writing about him three years earlier in search of a very rare and barely seen Orchid called the Ghost Orchid. As with Spike Jonze's Being John Makovich there are quite a few surreal and amazing things about this film and the way it draws comparisons to people, life, flowers, Hollywood, love, writing etc. are endless and just stunning. Overall Adaptation is one of the best acted films of the year with all 3 people giving great performances especially Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep and features a totally inventive and amazing story. The only reason I'm not rating this higher is the rather arbitrary and derivative action-oriented ending. It just didn't feel like the proper resolution to this film. Still a very good film."
668,Adaptation.,,14 March 2003,Another fun psychic trip. See this movie and evolve.,"(SPOILERS)OK so you know what the content of the movie is and how brilliantly it was executed and how the storyline is mixed with the story of how the script got made etc but what's it really about? Well for me this film is about the mental anguish of creating and thus living.Charlie the screenwriter is split in two, struggling to come to terms with his need to create and express himself artistically and his need for (if you like) instant gratification. As with Being John Malcovich this film is a head trip - A two hour work out for the brain and therapy for the soul. Only when he has satisfied his artistic and commercial bent does Charlie become whole again. And then his life is complete when he gets the girl ...blah blah blah etc. (Until the next crises....? Ha Ha Ha!)The first part of the movie explores Charlie's artistic side as he tries to create a worthy script and the second/last part is Charlie selling out to finish the project. This changeover had me thrown for a while but, its the film makers genius that you cannot let yourself be led by the nose on this one, this is not an example of film making by numbers.
Jonze and Kaufmann use the full cinematic paint box and have shown themselves with the ability to stretch burn, cut displace misplace replace build and burgle splice and dice the whole canvas. This is done with an effortless touch that belies true talent. They are just beginning to explore what can be done.True cinema should be able to talk directly to the brain, enter and be understood without speaking. Not only do Jonze and Kaufmann seem to understand how this is done but they are so good at it that they can warp, mold  and manipulate the language of cinema in new ways that leaves your brain out of breath, sweating, invigorated and smoking a cigarette.But hold on, I've lost my train of thought... ""A cup of coffee to help me think .... yeh a cup of coffee and a muffin."" Who did not laugh at that, come on tell me, give me another laugh!Interesting question - When you think about this movie do you concentrate on : Crashes, fulfillment, flowers, farce, structure, editing, technical qualities, acting, directing, secretary with hearing problem, one-guy-two-characters, artists p/blundering of the self to create etc OR do you take them as a given quality and move onto an appreciation of this as an exploration of the human psyche?For me the Orleans character is there to tell us that fulfillment is gained by living YOUR life not by living THROUGH someone elses.
The deconstructionist joke had me in stitches and still gives me a chuckle. This is a black comedy that highlights aspects of the human condition with delicious hilarious inventivness. Neurosis and ego battle it out for control over the author and the script. For example - Charlie the artist is sweating blood trying to get a script out of himself and his self-confident but shallow brother blows into town, decides he wants to be a script-writer as well and succeeds superficially/commercially. This prompts Charlie to doubt himself even more. His mind has been so bent out of shape by this process, he has f***ed it up so badly that he has put himself into the script (One of the funniest parts of the movie). For me he has just entered his own head (a brilliantly executed mind f***) - it takes over from where John Malcovich enters his own head in Being John Malcovich. Here in Adaptation we go straight into Charlie K's head - population - Charlie and the characters he is creating. He is so wrapped up in the task at hand, reality and fiction are so intertwined that he has entered the story and his own head completely and cannot find the exit without the help of his more ""seize-the-day"" type other-half.Some people think that the ending was a let down. But it was Donald's ending, that should be enough explanation - but for me it was true to itself and provokes thoughts about Hollywood giving us happy endings and what we want. Be careful what you wish for. In art and life you might have to compromise to get things done at the very least you come to terms with opposite needs. Is the satisfaction of these needs the root of all self-doubt and the seed of artistic endevours? Charlie has satisfied himself somewhat but the fulfillment he finds is uneasy. Is Donald exorcised from Charlie or do they both merge to become a new Charlie Kauffmann? Is compromise and a persons ability to change/adapt the way to achieve fulfillment? Charlie seems at ease with his sellout ending and thus himself but I'm not convinced. He has made an uneasy peace/alliance/truce with himself. Charlie does not look completely contented at the end and I don't think it's Cage's inability to show this.
Is he a neurotic junkie anxious about his ability to handle the next fix but driven like all artists to persue it even if it kills him or warps his mind even more?.The film is an expression of the human condition and life as never experienced before. Just sit back and enjoy the intensely funny and poetic trip that Charlie is going through to find himself and a story. See this movie and evolve.Jomojo"

670,Adaptation.,,11 March 2003,A story about an Adaptation: Innovation at its best,"Cameron diaz said before the release of 'being John Malkovich': ""They say there are 14 scripts in hollywood, well this is the 15th"". After seeing Adaptation you can easily that this the 16th and will surpass any of the earlier 15 in brilliance. story starts with charlie kaufman and his twin brother Donald(both portrayed by nicolas cage). Cage has played both parts wonderfully well which shows the depth of his acting abilities. The story revolves around charlie who is trying to write an adaptation of the book ""The orchid thief"" written by Susan Orleon (Meryl Streep). The orchid thief in turn is about a man John laroche(Chris cooper). Story unfolds the reality which is untold in the book and at the same time maintains a certain closeness with the characters of Charlie and Donald.The direction by Spike Jonze is very good. The sequences of events has been carefully paced. So you will never feel bored. Script has been carefully written so as to give good weightage to all characters.What is most amazing about this movie is that the direction takes the helps of flashbacks at his will, and still you never feel confused at any point of time. There are some 7-8 flashbacks in the movie which are the life of the movie. All in all it is a brilliantly told story.direction  ****acting     ****1/2story      *****camerawork ****overall    ****"
671,Adaptation.,,11 March 2003,Go see with an open mind and be entertained.,"I went to see this film four days ago and can't get it out of my head.  I did not know what the film was about when i went to the theatre but saw comedy and went for it. For the first 30 minutes i wondered what the hell was going on and i admit pretty bored, people even left the theatre. But then it got good, really good.SPOILEROnce the car crash takes place, flowers, Merryl Streep starts getting high,flowers, Donald and Charlie become spies, flowers,the alligators attack, the film is really gets going. I found the script to be genuinely warm and funny. This is the strangest movie I've seen so far this year but the first to get me thinking. If you like your movies that mix the mainstream with the art house movie, then give this film a go. Its not a film that you can easily explain to others (see 'magnolia', 'Being John Malkovich')and your friends will probably hate it. With an open mind you'll leave the theatre somewhat bewildered but you will have been genuinely entertained."
672,Adaptation.,8,9 March 2003,a very good movie,"Nicholas Cage is very good in his dual role of 2 such different characters and Meryl Streep is her usual outstandingly wonderful actress.  The whole thing is credible and runs well, but I have found a trifle too long - it would have benefitted from a bit of editing."
673,Adaptation.,,10 March 2003,Smart ass film making...,"Not a fan of Being John Malkovich, I therefore had reservations about this one, well founded as it turned out.Nic Cage is one of those actors (Kevin Spacey is another) who can only act in one dimension. So if he's meant to be insecure, lacking in confidence? That's what you get in spades.And Meryll Streep can do the uptight New Yorker in her sleep, straight from The Hours, and it showed.SPOILERSBut the film meandered along pleasantly enough for the first hour or so without really developing. After they moved to Miami, however it became farcical - Meryll waving guns around and swearing like a trooper, guys being eaten by crocodiles, car crashes. Ludicrous and almost unwatchable....I realise it was meant to be clever clever, Nic's brother taking over the script and so on, but the characters have to be believable.Seeing his brother killed in a car crash would have destroyed Nic 1, not acted as the trigger for a happy ending, script completed, gets the girl everybody's happy...And the final shot with Nic 1 driving away with a voice over is self congratulatory film making in the extreme...."
674,Adaptation.,8,10 March 2003,"If you like good films, see this no need to read further!","I mostly read reviews after I've seen a film, prefering to know as little about a film as possible before viewing. The first two thirds is amusing. We are distracted by this goofy Nicholas Cage. We marvel at the technical genius of having 2 of them!!. I looked for flaws here but couldn't find any; except for the standard CGI thing were people never stare eye to eye. The end seems a bit silly until later when you realise that that's part of the ""plot"". Yep funny without ever being self-indulgent! Cage has been Hollywood's wasted talent for too long"
675,Adaptation.,8,8 March 2003,Clever and complex,"A movie that teases the viewer as it moves back and forward through time following a complex storyline in which the characters all inter-weave. At first it is not clear where reality begins and ends - are there really twins or is one  just the writers alter-ego? The ending is predictable enough and this is an almost undefinable film that satisfies on a number of levels (it is even quite exciting towards the end)but more than anything, it makes you think and that can't be a bad thing. I could have done without the usual mannered and highly irritating performances by Meryl Streep and Nicholas Gage. No Oscars here please."
676,Adaptation.,,7 March 2003,"Interesting, smart and clever","Adaptation is a very troubling piece to comment on due to its complexity that is the script and the realistic characters that the film follows piece by piece. First off, Nicholas Cage plays a troubled Hollywood screenwriter whose terrible low self-esteem and writers-block assists him as he slowly drowns in his own misery and shame. Our character is set on a task to adapt a ground breaking novel into a movie that is supposed to live up to the semi-documentary style of writing that was portrayed by a women's quest for truth and passion through the beauty of the Orchid flower. During the movie we are pushed through both the characters minds taking us deeper into their passions, realities and eventually self-destruction.What satisfied my hunger for character development was the slow transformation as every character was slowly pushed over the edge with a sense of realism and complexity that is every human's reality through their darkest days and happiest moments. Meryl Streeps portrayal as a soft hearted reporter studying the beauty's of the Orchid flower and everything she ever wanted, is without doubt one her finest performance to date. The film is filled with a dark sense of comedy as we see our main character played by Cage, as he's tries to overcome his difficulties on his quest to enter the mind of the writer and the way we follow through all his situations as his inner monologue narrates bringing constant laughs. The film focuses strictly on the characters and every person who can successfully maintain an open mind through out the film will be able to walk off feeling they've had there share of sophistication and in-depth complexity, depending which character they decided to focus on more. Spike Jonze's piece can only be viewed so many times and can be compared realistically to his previous well-known film `Being John Malkovich' which surprisingly enough the film is related to and mentioned numerous times, as the film, within the film. Unfortunately there is no straight answer one could gain after viewing this film; it is undoubtedly a film that grows on you and a film that has different perspectives through out almost every scene. But one thing is clear and that is that it is one of the most interesting and unique cinematic experiences of the year that no one should ever turn there back on."
677,Adaptation.,,7 March 2003,A doll's house of a movie,"A news item about the arrest of an American orchid thief becomes an article for the ""New Yorker"" magazine which becomes a successful book which in turn is optioned for a film. The scriptwriter finds it so difficult to turn the book into a screenplay that he finishes up turning the film into an account of his struggle to adapt the book with himself as a central character in the movie. Confused? Well, this is the writer (Charlie Kaufman) and the director (Spike Jonze) that created the critically-acclaimed ""Being John Malkovich"", so this Russian doll of a movie is perhaps not a total surprise - but does it work?It is certainly pretentious and self-indulgent and the ending is a disappointment, but what lifts the film into a must-see category is the superb performances of its actors. I am an enormous fan of Meryl Streep (who plays the author of The Orchid Thief"") and ""Adaptation plus ""The Hours"" makes this is a great time for us devotees; I don't always like Nicolas Cage, but he is impressive as both Kaufman and his (fictional) twin brother; however, the revelation is Chris Cooper who shines as a man whose life is defined by his absolute passion for orchids."
678,Adaptation.,10,6 March 2003,One weird mid trip,"Talk about a movie that plays with your head. This movie takes truely unseen plot twists, and by the end, you wonder how it all happened so fast. Nicolas Cage is a great actor and is finally given a chance to prove himself again. And Chris Cooper...... wow. He stills the show as the con man with a brain. His character is funny, sad, and sometimes likeable. This movie is being snubbed at the oscars this year! Sure the actors were nominated, but why not the movie? Oh well. Check it out."
679,Adaptation.,,4 March 2003,excellent,"there seems to be a lot of debate about the validity of kauffmans use of himself as a character, the story in a the story methos etc. a few of the comments ive read seem to be scathing of this device. in my opinion this film is excellently written, and the device is quite sound. paul auster uses a similar device in the new york trilogy (city of glass). the whole thing is well versed in cinematic and critical theory and is refferent to roland barthes idea of the death of the author. to write a screenplay about oneself writing a screenplay is also a good way of displaying hollywoods facination with itself, a theme picked up by being john malkovic, and is therefore consistent with kauffmans previous body of work. aside from the arguements about the ending, which i do think is a touch weak, despite the sound theory behind it, i thought the film was also well directed and superbly acted, particularly by nicolas cage, who has certainly crept up in my estimation as a result. it is very encouraging to see big stars who could quite easily cash in with bland hollywood thrillers speniding their time on more challenging projects. tom cruises recent work is another example, as is selma hayeks new film ' frida.back to adaptation, i woud give it an eight, though gain, it would have been more had the ending been a little more challenging."
680,Adaptation.,9,4 March 2003,Excellent,"There is not much to say when you run upon a very good movie like ""Adaptation"".  If you liked ""Being John Malkovic"" you will like this movie. The last third of the movie will throw you for a loop but it is all worth it. 3 and a half stars."
681,Adaptation.,5,5 March 2003,NO WRITER'S BLOCK,"About thirty minutes into this film I was bored. Another self-indulgent tale of writer's block. But stick with this because it ends up as one of the most intelligent comedies in years. Not quite as good as ""Being John Malkovich"" but still really good.Cage is an enigma, but this him on form. Even Streep isn't too irritating."
682,Adaptation.,10,4 March 2003,The New 2nd Best Film of 2002,"This has just beaten The Two Towers and Catch Me If You Can as the 2nd best film of 2002. It was brilliant, every minute of it. The Screenplay was so well written it has to win the Oscar for adapted Screenplay. It just has to.Nicolas Cage gave a brilliant performance as both Charlie and Donald Kaufman. Chris Copper was excellent as John Laroche, he will no doubt win Best Supporting Actor. Meryl Streep was also great as Susan Orlean, she is my 2nd choice for the Supporting Actress Oscar. Overall, 10 out of 10."
683,Adaptation.,9,3 March 2003,Deserves ACADEMY AWARDS!,"I will have to think about this movie for a long time and watch it over and over again. It was so cleverly written. It has so much to say about life and everyone who finds himself lost in it. Great movie, great acting and great screenplay!"
684,Adaptation.,,3 March 2003,Screen Adaptation,"Interesting insight into the inner torment of a screenplay writer, particularly a Jewish-American writer. The superimposed figure of Nicolas Cage was clever, having him appear as two different characters in the same scene (shadows included), and the realistic inner life of a masturbating single writer."
685,Adaptation.,,2 March 2003,Pure cinematic joy,"Adaptation.
Once I was trying to write a short story and was stuck. The old advice to budding writers `write about what you know' came to mind, and what I knew about at the time was a budding writer trying to think of an idea for a story. So I began to write a story about a budding writer who was stuck and began to write a story about a budding writer who was stuck and began to write about  you get the picture. There were various other twists, by the way, if that summary sounded exceptionally boring (you don't think I'm going to reveal them here, do you?). But I abandoned the story, because of the ridiculous belief that fiction should be about Emotions and Great Themes and The Famine and Difficulties With Girls.Adaptation is the best film of the year so far and made me wish I stuck with my story. It is manages to be intricate and amazingly clever but also, through not even trying, moving and emotionally true. It begins on the set of Being John Malkovich with a (real) out-take of Malkovich ordering the crew to cut the dead time between takes. The camera follows various real-life figures from the Being John Malkovich set, finally focussing on `George Kaufmann', the screenwriter of (he really was) who is played by Nicholas Cage.The George of Adaptation is a neurotic bag of self-loathing and doubt, hired to adapt New Yorker writer Susan Orlean's elegiac, and apparently action-free, tale of orchid obsession The Orchid Thief. George's happy-go-lucky/annoying (delete according to taste) twin brother Donald (also played, naturally, by Cage) decides to become a screenwriter too and becomes a devotee of a screenwriting guru, much to George's initial disdain. I don't want to give away anymore of the plot, as much of the joy of the film lies in the brilliant way it perfectly predicts itself and contains itself, the way the Adaptation of the title refers not only to adapting a book into a film but to Darwinian natural selection, to personal change, and most dizzyingly of all to the film itself.
Reality and the world of the film merge confusingly; for example the screenwriting credit goes to `George and Donald Kaufmann, adapted from the book The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean'.  Characters within the film talk about their portrayal in the script and constantly wonder who will play themselves. Oddly, despite its cleverness the structure of the film is actually quite linear, aside from flashbacks that are more traditional than they seem. And for all its avant garde, mess-with-your-head aspects, Adaptation gives the same kinetic rush of joy as Singin' in the Rain and Bringing Up Baby. It manages to be hip and vastly thought-provoking while `having a heart' in the most unsentimental and least manipulative way possible. In the end one has to stop writing and lay it on the line: see this film now, five times at least."
686,Adaptation.,,2 March 2003,OK,"OK, I get it! I understand what the writer and the director were thinking, but this one bored me quite a bit before getting started. I did not find it much funny until about halfway into it. If you want to laugh at the movie industry, it's fine, and some people will really love this one, but it misses the mark for me, at least for most of the first half. I suppose the sad brother was a bit overdone. Too bad, for it is a good idea, and I did enjoy a lot their previous film. If you want to think hard, go for it! I must say I did find the way it ends just great!"
687,Adaptation.,10,28 February 2003,Original and daring,"I agree this movie is not intended to satisfy all tastes, but I was amazed at its originality and the sequences they use to get into the story and transform it from a deep reflection into an adventure. Streep is (again) perfect, she always gives a high added value to her films. Cooper is incredibly good too. I also admired the reality that Cage projects to his character. I found the film challenging and smart."
688,Adaptation.,,27 February 2003,"Blurs the lines, pushes the envelope, and amazes","This film is quite a ride and even better than the original Jonze / Kaufman collaboraton that was Being John Malkovich.  Cage is wonderful as the Kaufman twins, representing self cofidence and self doubt within the two brothers.  Cooper is unbelievable in his role as the orchid theif I love his line when the orchid theif author tells him her book is going to be adapted into a movie ""I THINK I SHOULD PLAY ME"".  What an absurd thing to say in the movie, but its hilarious.  All three of the stars are oscar nominated and all three deserve the oscar.  Its a wonderful film."
689,Adaptation.,,26 February 2003,The start of a new era in screenwriting,"This movie is certainly not perfect. I can't really pinpoint it's flaws, but some things just seemed to 'clever', not natural enough.But I think it is a genuine breakthrough in screenwriting, probably the biggest since ""the usual suspects"", which as far as I know was the first movie experimenting with images which turned out to be contradicted by the movies' own reality. ""Adaptation"" goes two steps further than that. It makes interaction with the world outside of the movie, with the making of this movie, etc. The opening shots (at the set of ""Being John Malkovich"") took me completely by surprise, as this was supposed to be fiction, and here was John Malkovich talking between the shots!Cameron Diaz has said about ""Being John Malkovich"": ""Some people say there are only 14 scripts in Hollywood. Well, this is number 15."" I'd like to adapt that for ""Adaptation"": There are only two scripts in Hollywood. One of them is Adaptation's. But I really hope for many more to come!"
690,Adaptation.,,25 February 2003,Sympathy,"I really do sympathise with the people who thought and wrote that they thought the ending got too over the top. I agreed but luckily my friend revealed the twist before I could embrarass myself. This is the first time this has happened to me and I think it raises questions about the lengths the creators went to in order to keep the twist secret from the audience. So although I enjoyed the film its now tainted by the fact that I left unfulfilled and the reason for this, I didn't get it. Everything else about this film is highly enjoyable but the question marks are there."
691,Adaptation.,8,26 February 2003,Very clever script,"This is easily one of the most unique and clever films I have ever seen and its the type of film that requires patience from the viewer and probably some discussion afterward. Nicolas Cage is excellent and once again proves what a good and solid actor he is. Yeah, he does his share of big budget Hollywood junk but every once in a while he does get involved in something artistic and it pays off! This film cleverly picks up where ""Being John Malkovich"" leaves off and Cage plays the writer (Real) Charlie Kaufman and also his twin brother (Not real) Donald who is a hack writer who writes junk that movie studios like! Chris Cooper probably gives his best performance with the exception of ""Lone Star"" and its a great role. He usually gets typecast has the bad guy so its refreshing to see him play something else. Meryl Streep plays writer Susan Orlean who's book is driving Charlie crazy as he tries to adapt it to the screen and then falls in love with her!*SPOILER ALERT* I am about to comment on the last part of the film so your warned! I know some viewers didn't understand why the film shifted gears and changed so drastically but the reason it did that was because Charlie had asked his brother Donald to help him with the script and when Donald took over, the film changed to his cheesy style of writing. Thats why you had the action sequences, gun shooting, chases in swamps and other traditional Hollywood formulas! So it is a very clever and imaginative script and film with some very good performances by all! This film stands a good chance of winning an Academy award for its script and maybe even Cooper for his supporting role."
692,Adaptation.,,24 February 2003,I must adapt,I have to adapt. In order to understand this film better. I plan on seeing this again. Now like a virgin I was being it was my first time seeing this film in the theater. I never thought I would be so puzzled afterward. I thought I might as well go and see what it was all about and then I was like afterwards scratching my head trying to figure out its meaning. One should be advised that it is about writting screen plays. I write screen plays! It is about writters block. I have writters block! It sends a good message to me that if you wish to be a good writter you must adapt your style and look to writting the way you feel. Make it interesting yet puzzling so that it screws around with the minds of its audience into thinking about the film afterward. Please go see this film as it is in theaters or even when it is not. You may find you understand it but you may find it over your head. Thats such the beauty of it all!
693,Adaptation.,7,23 February 2003,"Clever and sometimes moving, but let down by the climax.","How exactly do you describe the plot of Adaptation'? It is the work of Charlie Kaufman, the mind behind the delightfully weird Being John Malkovich', a screenwriter who a while ago was struggling to adapt Susan Orlean's rambling, philosophical novel The Orchid Thief' into a script. So instead Kauffmann decided to write a screenplay about himself struggling to write a screenplay. Sound warped? Well, in the movie Charlie (an outstanding Nicholas Cage), describes his decision as self-indulgent, narcissistic, impossible to film'  fortunately he's wrong. What we get is an amusing, interesting, sometimes moving and above all clever film. It's centred around the struggles of Charlie, portrayed as an overweight, balding, self-loathing introvert, and his relationship with his fictional twin brother Donald (Cage again), who is Charlie's opposite: outgoing, confident, charming, a bit thick. Donald is also writing a screenplay  a hilariously corny and clichéd thriller that naturally sells for megabucks. This is Kauffmann contrasting the artistic and commercial sides of himself  Donald is also credited as writing the screenplay. Intertwined with the story of the Kaufmans is the tale of the troubled Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her relationship with the bizarre, egotistical subject of her novel, John Laroche, the actual orchid thief. What we have is a movie that works on several levels, blending fiction and reality in an entertaining mix. It's about flowers, it's about screenwriting, it's about loneliness, love and a bunch of other things.  It does not hang together perfectly, but it is a tribute to Kaufman's skill and that of the actors that it's a coherent and enjoyable as it is. Like Memento' playing time backwards or Groundhog Day' repeating the same day over and over, Adaptation' is one of those concept movies that's worth going to see just to admire how something so unusual is made to work. Unfortunately it is let down by the climax, which is unsatisfying. Seen in relation to a conversation Charlie has with a screenwriting guru and some of the comments both make about plotting, it is a clever way to bring the strands of the plot together, but it is perhaps too clever. With a too-sudden change from the tone of the rest of the movie it is neither comic enough to be funny nor believable enough to be satisfying. However overall Adaptation' is a very good film and one film fans with a taste for post-modern culture will particularly like.

694,Adaptation.,8,23 February 2003,"The Academy missed out on a real opportunity, here",Nicholas Cage should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Donald. Imagine the flap over that if he won for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for the same film. Almost as intriguing as having Donald be the scriptwriter and win an Oscar for Best Screen Play.
695,Adaptation.,10,24 January 2003,This movie changed my life.,Have you ever left a movie theater and for hours after you couldn't speak? Your mind races to try and keep up with the visual stimulation that you just saw and when you finally utter words out of your mouth to the people you saw the movie with the conversation if so deep that you don't know where to begin. You will be debating and talking about this movie for days to come. It truely changed my life. I just saw it a few days ago and I will be going back there is so much to take in and I can't wait for it to come out on dvd.
696,Adaptation.,5,29 January 2003,"Slow, but clever","A slow but rather clever twist is the theme of this movie.  Nicolas Cage plays a screenwriter twin.  Each of the twins is overweight to the surprise of  most of the audience.  However, Mr. cages facile acting job overcomes a slow film.  It is o.k. and cute, but now a great masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination."
697,Adaptation.,,25 January 2003,ingenious script hampered by weak closing act (spoilers),"Having trouble coming up with an idea for your next movie?   No problem. Just make THAT the subject of your next film.  Find the inspiration you need in the fact that you HAVE no inspiration.  Make yourself and the movie you are creating the focus of this new project, thereby turning bitter-tasting lemons into sweet-tasting lemonade.  Who knows?  It worked well for the Italian master, Federico Fellini, when he made ""8 1/2"" forty long years ago, and it might very well work for you.Both `8 ½' and Spike Jonze' new film, `Adaptation,' deal not only with the creative process, but also with what happens when that process suddenly stops dead in its tracks.   In this case, it is writer Charlie Kaufman who, fresh from the critically acclaimed hit `Being John Malkovich,' is confronted with the need to move ahead onto his next project.  Only his creative well has run dry.  Fearful of failure and riddled with self-doubt, the writer, played by a paunchy, balding Nicolas Cage, struggles with adapting a nonfiction magazine article, Susan Orlean's New Yorker piece entitled `The Orchid Thief' (about, you guessed it, orchid collecting), into a commercially viable screenplay.  Meanwhile, as deadlines approach and tensions mount, Charlie stares at blank sheets of paper curled up in his typewriter which seem to haunt, taunt and mock him for his inability to bring it all together.  Charlie wants nothing more than to finish his work, yet he refuses to compromise his integrity by going for the obvious in his screenplay.  He wants to distill the essence of Orlean's work and to capture on film the exquisite beauty of the flowers without recourse to phony melodramatics or manufactured conflicts.  The problem is, of course, that film, by its very nature, virtually demands drama and conflict, so Charlie is left with little to work with from the source material.  More galling even than that is the fact that his twin brother (the fictional Donald Kaufman, who earns co-screenwriter credit on the film) is feverishly writing his own screenplay (no writer's block here), a crassly commercial, by-the-numbers, formulaic affair that is the direct antithesis of everything the highly principled Charlie is trying to accomplish.  After all, in the world of commercial moviemaking, `compromise' is the great force that ends up moving mountains  and it is the rare artist who can have a successful career without it.   The third major character is Susan Orlean herself, a celebrated writer who discovers that, in spite of all her talent and acclaim, she has never found any one thing in her life to be truly passionate about.   In many ways, it is this lack of passion and this tendency to over analyze and over intellectualize every aspect of life that is inhibiting Charlie's creative impulses as well.  When Susan hooks up with this simple orchid collector, John Laroche, she feels that she has finally met a person who, through a profound dedication to a single cause, has unlocked some of the meaning of life.There is certainly much to praise in `Adaptation.'  The Pirandellian, film-within-a-film narrative structure is clever and challenging, as the moviemakers consistently cross over the line separating fiction from nonfiction. The sly movie industry `in' jokes (especially those concerning the `art' of screenwriting) are often sharp, witty and incisive.  Kaufman is not afraid to take a few good-natured jabs even at himself, as when Charlie admits that only the most pretentiously self-indulgent and vacuous storyteller would make himself the subject of his own work.  The relationship between the two Kaufmans, both expertly played by the same Nicholas Cage, is fascinating in the way the men can be so alike on the outside and yet so different on the inside.  Charlie is ingenious, introspective and paranoid, always second guessing his every move and evaluating his every action in terms of how they will make others see or judge him, while Donald is the exact opposite, prosaic, happy-go-lucky and openhearted, letting life just happen to him and not giving a damn what anyone else chooses to think of him.  Perhaps, the fictional Donald is really the alter ego Charlie wishes he could be.  How much easier it would be to be comfortable in one's own skin and to be able to conform to Hollywood standards with no nagging conscience to worry about.  The juxtaposition between the two men provides some of the wittiest and, yet, most moving moments in the film.  Meryl Streep does a fine job highlighting the basic emptiness of a searching soul, and Chris Cooper has charm to spare as the toothless orchid collector who serves as the focus of Susan's article and, ultimately, her life.The controversial aspect of `Adaptation,' and the one that has proved most troublesome for a large segment of even its most appreciative, receptive audience, is the direction the film takes in its final half hour.  As I see it there are a few possible explanations as to just what Kaufman and Jonze are up to here: a) they simply ran out of inspiration and didn't know how to bring their story to a proper close (unlikely); b) they are doing a parody of the infamous Weak Third Act Syndrome that has haunted writers from the very beginning of recorded history (possibly); or c) they are trying to show - as the theme of the film implies  that in order to survive and move ahead in this life, we all end up `adapting' ourselves to our environment and situations, just as Kaufman himself is doing, finally providing the kind of melodramatic superstructure this essentially nonlinear story about orchid collecting needs to make it saleable.  Yet, regardless of which interpretation is correct, the fact remains that the final act of this film really IS bad and goes a long way towards undercutting the value of so much of the rest of the film.  Or does it?  I think maybe we are SUPPOSED to hate the final act of this film. Perhaps it is a way of condemning the wretched excesses that define the kind of formulaic screenwriting Charlie is so opposed to on principle.  Yet, why is Charlie so seemingly enlightened at the end?  Why the sense of epiphany?  Or is that the point too?  That Hollywood wins over another soul to its side and the ending is really not a happy ending at all?  Could the point be that artistic compromise can never bring true satisfaction either for the artist or for the observers of that art?  Have Kaufman and Jonze succeeded in completely pulling the wool over our eyes?  Are we being made the fall guys for their angry little joke against both the Hollywood Establishment and the easily manipulated audiences who so crave a feel-good, happy-ever-after ending that we fall right in line in our responses?  After all, Jonze and Kaufman could hardly be accused of making formulaic films!  Who knows?  And maybe that's OK too.I wish I could say I loved `Adaptation,' but the truth is that Kaufman and Jonze seem to have fumbled the ball right as they were crossing over the goal line. Or did they?  I admit that the jury here is still out on this issue.  I am willing to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, if need be, and spend a little more time thinking about all this.  In the meantime, I will simply state for the record that `Adaptation' is an enjoyable, clever and entertaining work, but that it just might fall short of being the masterpiece so many critics acclaim it to be."
698,Adaptation.,7,12 January 2003,"Good, but doesn't live up to hype","I liked Adaptation, don't get me wrong, but, like Kaufmans theory on The Orchid Thief, nothing really happens. There is no plot. It's characters moving around doing things. Then the ending.The ending is my major complaint. It leaves the audience unsatisfied. What happens to Orlean? What about Amelia and Charlie? What about...Too many loose ends are left, which, might be a good thing if this were a thinking movie. I was too focused later on why it has all this Oscar Hype. Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper deserve the nominations the will likely get, but the nomination for Best Picture (Which, again, it will likley get) is not deserved.Good, but could have been better. 8/10"
699,Adaptation.,4,10 January 2003,Utterly Forgettable Conceit,"Lots of gimmicks, lots of pretense, lots of MTV camera, lots of hip actors, retro songs. Lots of flash n' trash.An offensively empty waste of my time. And I SO wanted to like Adaptation, so much hoped it'd be intelligent. It is not. It's dumb.Hey, NOTHING more boring than hearing a writer whine about not writing. I didn't ask to be made captive audience for Kauffman's therapy session - that was not the agreement. His job is not to use me to vent. His job is to write, not complain about being unable to.Wanna watch me sit on stage with my cello while I snivel about not being able to play?Critics here loved this fluffy confection - why? I guess because critics are writers. Or because they know Charlie Kauffman. Or because these two guys are hipsters. Or because critics are dumber than I give them credit for and easily seduced by clever-appearing gimmickry.Chris Cooper was good. Meryl is always excellent. Nic Cage doesn't know how to play Jewish.Hey, was that ending spozed to be a joke about har har here are the chase scenes/drugs/guns/sex/character arcs after all? Shtoopid, really really shtoopid.I've already forgotten this one."
700,Adaptation.,,7 January 2003,Great premise and build up fails in 3rd act,"***SPOILERS AHEAD*************I was very upset by the third act.  It left a very poor taste in my mouth. It was cheating.  Instead of summoning something from deep inside his soul to create a (possibly) magical third act, Kaufman decides to wuss-out, marked most clearly by the line ""We have to kill him.""  Give me a f***ing break!  The first 60-70 minutes of the film were absolutely delightful as Kaufman struggles with himself and his life and the task at hand.  I empathized with Kaufman's plight of a nearly impossible task (and not just because I'm an aspiring writer; this type of nearly impossible task is someone everyone can relate to).  I enjoyed the scene in the elevator when Kaufman simply cannot talk to Orlean, I enjoyed the McKee scene.
In fact, I am in the process of reading McKee's Story, and I doubt very strongly if he would have sanctioned the third act as it played out on screen.  The third act was absolutely disconnected from the first 60-70 minutes of the film and a genuine disappointment.
What should have been a thoroughly satisfying film ended up as bad as any cliche-filled movie I've seen.  I realize some people have said that this was their point, to cleverly take off on cliche'd endings.  But this is a little too self-congratulatory."
701,Adaptation.,7,11 January 2003,"First half great, second half embarrassing","As a writer I loved the first half of this movie.  Great opening!  The movie kept me guessing, surprised, and delighted till it took a sudden turn into mediocrity and melodrama.  Did the writer get drunk and couldn't finish the script?  Decide to satirize his own movie?  Or just cop out and decide to supply a standard cliche violent ending?????  You decide...I did, and I should have stuck to my decision to walk out of the movie when Meryl Streep pulls a gun out.....too bad...could have been a wonderful movie, now it's just another loser..."
702,Adaptation.,7,7 September 2003,Was there something I missed?,"As a film student, I can really appreciate the writing in Adaptation and theremarkable acting by Nick Cage and Chris Cooper. They were amazing, nobones about it. But where I got lost was nearing the end when it became almost like Kaufman's imagination ran wild, and when there was no return to reality, I felt deprived of structure. The entire movie is a lot to take and obviously isn't for everyone, but I feel bad because many people claim it to be astounding, great and wonderfully humorous. But I just didn't get it. Was there something TO get?"
703,Adaptation.,4,30 December 2002,A good idea gone wrong.,"This freaking mess of a film does have its interesting moments. I will admit to thinking about several other noteworthy films while watching. I thought about how much better 'Fight Club' was, how much better 'True West' was, how much better 'Moonlighting' was. This film has nothing in common with 'Moonlighting' apart from Nicholas Cage, but as I was sitting there getting angrier and angrier at the laziness and sloth built into this film I simply drifted off into happier thoughts. I see this film as an interesting first draft that might have been okay for a film school project but which should never have been allowed into theaters."
704,Adaptation.,10,6 September 2003,Its Great; A Big Improvement Over Malkovich,"My Rating:**** out of ****. Charlie Kaufman has great ideas in his head, Being John Malkovich was a damn brilliant premise, but the dialogue wasnt that great. Now he tries to adapt a book called the Orchid Thief, Kaufman failed to adapt the book. So he writes a screenplay about his failure to adapt it. Its a brilliant idea.
But this is just not another brilliant idea with just average dialogue. This is a brilliant idea with great dialogue. Charlie Kaufman is now one of the best screenwriters of today. Spike Jonze teams up with Kaufman as director of Adaptation, Jonze's direction is superior to his direction in Being John Malkovich. The acting is superior in Adaptation. Nicolas Cage is brilliant in a dual role as Charlie and Donald Kaufman, he gets both their personalities right. Chris Cooper does a great job as John LaRoche, a man who lost everything in a car crash. Meryl Streep also does great as writer Susan Orlean, she and Cooper have great chemistry. The rest of the cast does great.
One thing that has always been complained about Adaptation is the ending. Many people think this is cliched. There are many ways to analyze this. Think of Donalds screenplay for one. Overall, Adaptation is not for everyone but those who are willing to watch will get much out of it."
705,Adaptation.,,30 December 2002,Analyse that!,"Saw the movie, and at the end of it, it felt as if I'd paid for C. Kaufman's therapy. He bares himself and it's not very attractive to watch, especially since he seems to be taking himself a little too seriously (in spite of the several self-directed gibes)."
706,Adaptation.,10,1 September 2003,Amazing!,"Adaptation is a fantastic movie that had me gripped from beginning to end. Meryl Streep is as ever brilliant and Nicholas Cage and Chris Cooper are superb. The film is funny, interesting, unusual and great all at once. Definatly one of the best films of 2002 and in my top ten for sure."
707,Adaptation.,,6 December 2002,To quote one of the characters - a waste of 2 hours of my life,"Irony is a delicate means of communication.  It requires wit and intellect to both send and receive.  A movie that uses irony to tell a story about irony by definition stands on a precipice overlooking a long, 2 hour descent into boredom.  And ""Adaptation"" plummeted over the edge in a swan dive of indulgent and obtuse incoherence that must rank it as one of the most pointless bits of celluloid drivel I've seen.  The humour, inspired by Woody Allen's self deprecating insecurity, never achieves the necessary degree of subtlety to create more than a polite snigger here and there.  The plot, such as it was, was predictable, banal and oh so slow  (and yes, the point of this tedium ad nauseum is noted as part of the overall intention), and ultimately utterly fails to entertain.  US audiences may derive some cynical pleasure from a tedious movie about a tedious movie, but for those of us who are already bored by Hollywoods eternally regurgitated themes of sex and violence, it simply tells us what we already know.  Cage barely got out of first gear, Streep is past her ""use by"" date, and Cooper embarrassed them both.  To make the irony complete, this garbage MUST get an Oscar."
708,Adaptation.,10,25 November 2002,What comedy should be.,"A truly clever, very funny film.  If you thought Sienfeld made something out of nothing, wait till you see this.  I cannot remember a movie where writers' block has been explored/exploited with as much wit. Brought to you by the same director (Spike Jonze) and writer (Charlie Kaufman) who made ""Being John Malkovich,"" this is a direct descendent, if not exactly a sequel, to that film.  (Malkovich, Cathy Keenan, several others, make brief guest turns in this movie.)  What sets the movie spinning (as opposed to a traditional plot) is a question; How do you make a movie adaptation of a book that is impossible to film?  The answer is, make a film about the writer trying to make an adaptation of a book that is impossible to film.  Oh, and while you are at it, make the movie of the book, make it a little autobiographical (in your own parallel universe), and, just for the heck of it, give it a Hollywood treatment.  It is as loopy as it sounds . .. and that is a very good thing. All of the actors turn in terrific performances.  Cage reminds you why you thought he was such a great actor.  (Tell the truth, didn't his last few movies have you wondering?)  Meryl Streep is a joy to watch and should be congratulated for throwing herself into a role they have not often asked a ""woman of a certain age"" to do.  She does so with considerable abandon. Somebody, please, find more rolls for this cinema treasure!  (OK, I am the same age as she is and have had a crush forever, but she is great!) However, a Best Supporting Actor award of some stripe is going to go to Chris Cooper.  His performance almost steals the movie from under everybody else's noses. A word of caution.  This is another in a very long line of ""inside Hollywood"" movies.  It is even more inside than ""The Player.""  I got to see it in a theater full of young men, dressed in black, speaking on cell phones, in the heart of Hollywood.  Yes, an audience of insiders.  The place was roaring with laughter.  (Jonze, Kaufman, and Cage were in attendance and gave a terrific post-showing Q&A.)  How this will play in, say, Kansas City, is another question."
709,Adaptation.,,14 November 2002,Someone call a script doctor,"After half an hour I was delighted. After an hour I was ecstatic. After an hour and a half I was glowing. After two hours I was depressed.This film is an enigma. I don't understand how the same person who wrote the first two acts could have written the last one. But then again, that may have been what the writer was going for.The film begins with a blast of Charlie Kaufman's inspiring comic energy. It later resolves into a poignant picture of human souls caught in their own confusing character arcs. But in the end these arcs fail to curve. They only convulse. And while this shakes up the story, it ultimately forsakes the truth of the characters. The film loses its emotional resonance, betraying its own wisdom, and losing the faith of its audience.I was almost inspired, but ultimately deceived.Love,Edward"
710,Adaptation.,10,15 April 2003,A Rare Treat,"A story within a story, Adaptation is a rare treat inside screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's talented yet tormented mind as he attempts to carve out a screenplay from Susan Orlean's publication The Orchid Thief.  Her book, while an intriguing true account of botanical expert John Laroche who collaborates with Seminole Indians in Florida to exploit rare ghost orchids, apparently doesn't have enough of a storyline to translate to the big screen.  Kaufman and Director Spike Jonze take us through Charlie's own mental gymnastics by offsetting his character with a fictional twin brother Donald, who is a less talented but more outgoing and pragmatic screenwriter, and by brilliantly interweaving pieces from Orlean's original story.Nicholas Cage gives one of his finest and most convincing performances as twin brothers Charlie and Donald.  He descends deeply into their minds and souls in order to capture the fine yet distinct differences in their approaches both to screenwriting and to life.  Cage is more than aptly supported by Meryl Streep, who as Susan Orlean transitions brilliantly from understated writer to an equally tormented soul of Kaufman's imagination and by Chris Cooper, who as John Laroche gives us a healthy dose of someone unwavering and a bit unsavory in his motivations.  The juxtaposition of these characters is what drives Kaufman to the brink of insanity and ultimately this film to its lofty heights."
711,Adaptation.,,15 April 2003,I think it's not so serious as the authors tried to present it,"It's a pity that Cage didn't get Oscar for his role - I think it was the best personage in his career. (2 best personages). But I'm sure that this movie seems much more serious than it is. A desire of any passion - may be it's flower passion or writer's passion - is it anything new? But the screenplay is excellent, Cage, Streep and Cooper are so exciting. My congratulations to Mr Cooper."
