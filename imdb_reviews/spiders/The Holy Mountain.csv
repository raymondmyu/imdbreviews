0,The Holy Mountain,10,24 April 2005,"Not just a Film, an Experience!!!","How can the average person describe the Holy Mountain? They can't, It's one of those films that is so bizarre that one has to witness it at least 5 times to fully appreciate it. Alejandro Jodorowsky takes every form of religion and mysticism and puts it into symbolic imagery, that turns into a two hour mind trip. The film is not thrown together, each scene is so chock full of strange imagery, yet each image has a particular meaning. The plot concerns, the thief, who seems to be representational of Christ in modern times. The thief awakens in the desert, almost crucified by children, he is then rescued by an amputee dwarf. After him and the dwarf share a joint, they travel through different scene after scene of surreal images. In one scenario a police state has taken over downtown Mexico. Innocent people are massacred, and birds fly out of their bullet wounds. The conquest of Mexico is reenacted by frogs and iguanas. The Christ character gets drunk with Roman soldiers, and they make a mold of him to produce statues for profit. And this is all in the first twenty minutes. The occult science of alchemy is another factor of the film. The thief finally meets the alchemist, played by Jodorowsky himself, and the alchemist turns his excrement into gold. The black magic of alchemy involves the nine planets of the solar system. We are then introduced to 7 of the most powerful people in the world named after the planets of the solar system. Each person is corrupt and greedy involved in politics, war or mass marketing. Each person who has their own planet, and a weakness is willing to give up their money and be reborn as a Buddhist monk. In a way these people are alchemists also since they have the ability to turn worthless items such as weapons and cosmetics into riches. Since money is just paper, in a way the magic of alchemy in everyday life convinces us that the dollar bill is of value. Many aspects of life are just an illusion, just as in cinema. In the Holy Mountain Jodorowsky proves to be the master of illusion like a magician. Also his character, the Alchemist has the job of spiritual leader to lead all of the 9 people to the Holy Mountain including the Christ character and the women with the Kaballah tattoos. Also the film is indulgent at times in it's Frued like sexuality and nudity. It is both strange and intriguing, both hilarious and horrifying, and one of the weirdest films your most likely to see. Their is so much that happens in this film, that it's almost impossible to describe. People who are looking for deep meaning in films like Donnie Darko need to keep searching, the films of Alejandro Jodorowsky would be a good start. The Holy Mountain is not only a masterpiece, it's a spiritual journey, and it just might very well change the way you look at the world. Not everyone will like it, so sit back and watch with an open mind. The Holy Mountain is one of the most underrated and important films ever made. 10/10"
1,The Holy Mountain,,18 June 2003,Come prepared to chuckle,"If you liked ""The Wall"" (you know, the Pink Floyd movie), but thought it was a bit of a downer and suffered from the lack of a fat woman humping an excitable, legless, animatronic horse, this movie could be for you.Despite what you may have heard, ""The Holy Mountain"" is more absurd than surreal, more funny than disturbing. Don't worry if your tarot cards are gathering dust and you can't remember the difference between wands and swords--such occult knowledge might help you achieve a few ""Oh I get that!"" moments during the middle of the film, but the heaps of blatant symbolism aren't really the point. In fact, it may just be that the point is: there is no point. When you see a fat man dressed as the Virgin Mary handing out crucifixes under a sign that says ""Christs For Sale"", you can rack your brain trying to figure out what kind of statement that makes about society--or you can laugh. When you witness ""The Government"" indoctrinating children with a hatred for the nation of Peru by printing up comic books called ""Captain Captain Against The Peruvian Monster"", you can lament the plight of innocents being manipulated for selfish ends--or you can laugh! This film bombards the viewer with outlandish images and juxtapositions like these in rapid fire throughout, so it's easy to get bogged down or confused or numb. The secret to appreciating it all is to come prepared to chuckle--some things you'll ""get"", some things you won't, but most everything is twisted and absurd and, in some way, funny. Now when you get to the end and Jodorowsky winks at you, you can wink right back.Basically, if you can appreciate absurdity and profundity and the absurdity of profundity (not to mention enormous, colorful sets), you'll find a lot to like here.PS: If you do like ""The Holy Mountain"", head down to your local comics shop (or browse over to your favorite book/graphic novel e-tailer) and pick up a couple of volumes of ""The Incal"" or ""The Metabarons"", both of which were also written by Jodorowsky. They're like this movie--every bit as garish and violent and thought-provoking and funny--but they have actual plots (epic space-opera plots, no less)."
2,The Holy Mountain,,28 June 2004,"Dated, pretentious, astonishing","I don't think this film can be ""reviewed"" in the normal sense of the word, only experienced as one would a painting or a piece of music. Having only seen it two nights ago, I'm not even sure I've fully processed it. In any case...To begin, the images, the images. The first 20 minutes contain some of the most astonishing images I've seen, combining Christian iconography, Latin American history, futurism, mysticism, and political commentary. As if Fellini had a sinister twin working with his leftover film and props. As the film progresses I thought the set pieces became a little dated and, frankly, I experienced sensory overload. I'm sure a lot of viewers would reject this film as pointless or indulgent. Yeah...so? I can't say I understood exactly what Jodoworsky was getting at (if anything), or if it would even make an impact on my view of the world. But if film is to be defined as image over everything else, then Jodoworsky is certainly some sort of master filmmaker. I'd rather watch something like this, filled with ideas (however pretentious), than a plot-driven movie with nothing more on its mind than wrapping up loose ends for the audience. Now, off to rent Santa Sangre."
3,The Holy Mountain,10,15 September 2014,My favorite movie!,"There is probably nothing on earth that can prepare for Alejandro Jodorowsky's masterpiece, holy mountain. The synopsis, as bizarre as it sounds doesn't even come close to describing this amazing film. The film introduces the viewer to an array of characters and freaks unlike any seen on the cinema screen. The Holy Mountain is in turns hilarious, confounding, disturbing and perplexing but this Jodorowsky's love letter to the art is never less than entertaining. Filled with alchemical illusions, tarot symbols, existential ideas, explicit gore and violence, gratuitous nudity, sacrilegious imagery, and perverse beauty, this movie will make you live an unusual experience. MUST SEE!"
4,The Holy Mountain,,6 February 2000,"Astonishingly beautiful, bloody and strange","Astonishingly beautiful, bloody and strange surrealist film.  Roughly, about a spiritual quest for enlightenment, truth and immortality; but that doesn't begin to describe Jodorowsky's Fellini-like flood of imagery and symbolism. Jodorowsky himself plays ""The Master"", an occult adept who assembles a group of people representing the planets of our solar system (a Christ figure for Earth) to ascend the Holy Mountain and gain the secret of eternal life. The qualities of the individual planetary cultures are both based on, and distorted from, their classic meanings in astrology and alchemy - you really need to have some basic reading in occultism to follow this movie - and the stunning ending shot takes the theme of illusion vs. truth to a completely different plane."
5,The Holy Mountain,7,22 August 2007,Art  - Don't Blame the Messenger!!!!,"Alejandro Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain is worth seeing once in a while. Not because it's difficult to figure out (it really isn't, unless you insist on figuring ALL of it out at once). But because you will be seeing a different movie each time, as your own perspective, mood and life changes.Holy Mountain is a meticulously made work of cinematic art. It is simultaneously a brilliant absurdist farce, a cynical satire which lampoons religion and capitalism, an affirmation of faith, an indictment of humanity for its cruelty, ignorance and greed and a celebration of life and the human spirit. Who and where you are will determine your interpretation, so don't blame Jodorowsky! He's just the messenger.Ostensibly, the film is about a fantastic spiritual journey undertaken by an apparently psychologically disturbed young man who looks a bit like what many Christians believe Jesus to have looked like. This young man begins his journey with insects swarming his face. He is either dead or passed out. Some naked children find him and decide to crucify him for fun. He yells at them (incoherently) and they run away. He then meets an amputee with just a couple half-limbs who becomes his friend for the beginning of the film.This describes the first five or so minutes of the film's plot. Although the film remains somewhat linear and simply plotted from this point to it end, it also draws deep on all manners of symbolism, mercilessly pokes fun at Christianity, its exploitation and its commercialization, and even throws in some pop-Buddhist concepts accompanied by a prophet with a talent for Jiu Jitsu. The entire crucifixion story is repeatedly portrayed, but with levels of absurdity that would probably have some Americans calling for its censorship today. Later, our protagonist will embark upon an apparently meaningless quest to climb the Holy Mountain with ten powerful companions. Though likable enough, the hero of the film is neither a hero nor a clearly developed character. His (at least) neurotic behavior, his uncertain sense of justice and sometimes animalistic approach to events make him a difficult character to like, but you will feel compelled to follow-through simply to discover what bizarre reality he will encounter next. Holy Mountain has some of the most impressive sets and surreal to psychedelic imagery I have seen in films of its vintage. Its soundscaping and soundtrack is also very impressive. The amount of dialog is refreshingly minimal, which also helps the director keep his audience focused on what the film does with sound and vision.Although the film is gorgeous, sensitive viewers should be aware that there is some fairly disturbing imagery in this film. It is meant to be watched while wide-awake and receptive, but strong.You can find all sorts of meanings in this film. You can label the film many different things. And you can understand it in whatever way works for you. But please do not make the mistake of thinking you've got it right or that your interpretation is anything but your interpretation. Holy Mountain, like many works of film art, does not work that way.Highly recommended for intellectuals, connoisseurs of film art, and those who enjoy cult films. Definitely not recommended for those who approach film solely as a means for entertainment, and not recommended for a first date (unless the couple has a strong intellectual bent and an interest in film)."
6,The Holy Mountain,10,22 April 2007,"Are you experienced?  Jodorowsky's ambitious Rorschach motion picture tests human's connection to spirituality, and cinema","How does one start describing writer/director/star/master-of-ceremonies Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain? Sensational, outrageous, in-your-face, (the much overused phrase) one-of-a-kind, hilarious, self-indulgent, dangerous, and enlightening could be some words, and there could be more. But these are just symbolic of what one goes into seeing the movie. And what is it to see a movie, to experience it, Jodorowsky, I think anyway, is essentially asking? What about faith, or belief that there can be a way to surpass mortality and live forever? Is there truly any basis to become more than just flesh and bones and organs and love and hate and desire and greed? Perhaps, in the end, it might just be art itself. The Holy Mountain is one (bleeping) crazy art-house picture experience, where the filmmaker asks it's audience to either go on the journey and be open to whatever he's liable to let out of the floodgates of his consciousness, or if to be closed off then to might as well leave. So as it goes, really, with organized religion, which his own character Jodorowsky plays- the Alchemist- could be identifiable as.As I left the theater I kept on thinking about what it is to put total trust and confidence in a ""master"", someone who seems to have all the knowledge and experience to take people to higher planes. At the core, is what the Alchemist can do for the nine ""planet"" representatives any different than what a priest or a rabbi or a monk can promise? There is a level of intellectual stimulation, aside from the obvious emotional connection to the immense level of surrealism, that keeps one from thinking that this becomes all weird for its own sake. Unlike El Topo, however, Jodorowsky this time is much more in control of his own delirious dreamscapes and, in a sense, the genuine consciousness he creates in his Holy Mountain. He gives us, at the start, something a little much akin to El Topo with piling on Christian symbolism and imagery like its got to get into our heads right away. This part, actually, might be somewhat weaker in comparison with the rest of the film, if only because one wonders where the hell this is all going; a Jesus-figure, who comes into a village loaded with circus 'freaks' and gawkers at such 'freaks', and is put into plaster-casting to make more Jesus figures, which he demolishes except for one which he carries with him for a little while.There's more than just this, but for the first twenty minutes, which is practically silent and without dialog, we get immensely rich but sort of free-form symbolism, some that is great (the scene with the frogs in the representation of the Spanish conquistadors is absolutely uproarious), and some that isn't, like a strange scene in a church. But soon Jodorowsky moves it along to 'Jesus' entering the realm of the Alchemist, and going under his tutelage (and learning how, mayhap, gold can be the end result of literal excrement), learns about who the other members to go on the journey to the holy mountain will be. It's here that Jodorowsky digs deep into the nature of the period he was filming in and how fascinating and perverse human beings can be. These other members are all shown in vignettes to be ""manufacturers"", for the most part, of weapons, clothing, architecture, political espionage, and as a police force of a sort. More than ever Jodorowsky throws out the outrageousness to eat up, and really it actually never shows (and maybe it's just me as a jaded 21st century guy) to be as shocking as one might expect. Yes, it's extremely violent (watch out for your genitals, by the way, when around these folks), extraordinarily sexually charged (sex machines anyone?), and meant to be in poor taste and so over the top you don't know what is up or down. At first, I thought it couldn't get much better, as far as sheer surrealist entertainment value goes.Yet as the last section develops, as the Alchemist takes his pupils to the mountain to meet their promised fates, there's more depth than I would have expected, even from all that preceded it as already containing cast quantities of rich socio-political-sexual commentary and prodding knife stabs at correctness. Religion itself, as Bunuel did in the past, is questioned very strongly and seriously, however still in the context of Jodorowsky having his own subjective approach. Of course, the director- who happens to be at the top of his game here stylistically, second only to Santa Sangre as perhaps his most accomplished effort- did become a shaman himself to make this movie, so there is a level of legitimate connection to what religion says to provide us. At the same time, Jodorowsky is, all the same, questioning what it means to submit yourself to indoctrination, to ""nothingness"" as the Alchemist says to his pupils in their trances. It's not just Christianity that needs to be taken with a grain of salt, although that is very significant in the final section (the 'monster' over the boat, for example, has a lot that can be read into it, ala sin), but that it has to be in the person to understand what immortality REALLY means. The final revelation at the table on the mountain nails it on the head, and suddenly (or not so suddenly) things become clearer; the final lines by the Alchemist (or rather, Jodorowsky himself), make it a very poignant end to what has been a delirious, hilarious trip into consciousness expansion...In a word, or a few, what it means to 'experience' a film itself, and once it ends, you step back into some kind of reality. The Holy Mountain is a true love it or hate it movie. I loved it, even as I still wonder what the hell it is I just saw/felt/heard/experienced, and of course if it should be believed."
7,The Holy Mountain,8,10 April 2008,I'll be damned,"A few months ago, I finally got to see El Topo, Jodorowsky's legendary western-on-acid. Quite simply, it blew me away. It was just so strange, so weird, so utterly crazy...I don't know, seeing El Topo on one viewing doesn't mean you'll be able to comprehend it well enough to describe it properly. I'll give it a second view some other time.Anyway....why I mentioned El Topo was because it raised the bar for what I could expect from The Holy Mountain, which promised to be even more of a mind-bending surrealist work than El Topo. For this is how, on the basis of a single viewing, I was prepared to judge The Holy Mountain - on just how bizarre it would get.This may sound a little shallow, but The Holy Mountain is one of those films that requires several viewings to properly comprehend pretty much everything that goes on. On one viewing, all you can do is try and keep your eyes on screen and try to take in as much of the film as possible. Even if you don't fully understand what's going on, take in the experience. That's what I did when I watched The Holy Mountain.The Holy Mountain begins by following a man who's best described as Christlike as he engages in his own journey from dying in the desert to a tall tower, where he meets a mysterious figure known as the Alchemist. The Alchemist recruits the man for his own plan, which involves bringing together several ""thieves"" from around the world so that they can embark on a quest for immortality atop the eponymous mountain.All this is a loose framework for Jodorowsky's trademark elaborate set-pieces - they're big and they're utterly loony. I don't think I'll bother spoiling any of them, but take any scene from the movie and it'll likely have a large, weird-looking set and at least one or two freaky-looking people drawing your attention. One thing that kept preying on my mind the whole time was just how unbelievable the whole idea of The Holy Mountain was. Like El Topo, it was an epic without a wider appeal, and that jarred me for some reason. It just keeps getting stranger and stranger until the end, which I will have to say was utterly unpredictable.The Holy Mountain is truly one-of-a-kind. It'd be pretty easy to say this film isn't for everyone, but it isn't. If you're into movies that don't make sense on the first time (or even the 10th time), I'd recommend this. Or if you're just looking for one intense filmic experience, it doesn't get much more intense than the imagery of The Holy Mountain.I'll end this review now - I've run out of synonyms for crazy.8/10 - this is after one viewing, it'll probably go up after about 7."
8,The Holy Mountain,10,30 October 2001,An absolutely brilliant film both in concept and execution.,"The Holy Mountain is an epic exploration of religious experience and global socio-political trends. A scathing indictment of the abuse of power by both first and third-world nations, while simultaneously a wonderfully clever fantasy that exposes art and religion as hilarious tools of mass-mind-control. It is a truly sweeping masterpiece full of amazing imagery and even more impressive thought. And it also has one of the best endings you are likely to see -ever. Too bad it is almost impossible to find."
9,The Holy Mountain,,18 December 2000,"Lush, Hallucinatory, Visionary.","Alejandro Jodorowsky's sprawling, psychedelic opus almost defies interpretation in any conventional sense. Steeped in symbolism and spirituality it is a piece of art that attempts to redefine the psyche and the human condition through a celebration of the surreal, the grotesque and the beautiful. Its inner meaning is deliberately vague, allowing personal interpretation to take the place of empty preaching and contrived moral messaging. Simply breathtaking."
10,The Holy Mountain,1,9 March 2014,A boring art house film delivering the wrong message,"What can you say about such a film? Some liken it to art, but as another reviewer said all film is art so that is not an appropriate justification. There is good and bad art and you'll have to do better than you just don't 'get' it. I hate when people have to justify that they 'got' a film before criticizing it.This film is on the most tasteless level of film making. I think people have fooled themselves into liking it. I almost did, I really had to think about the rating I would give this for a while. In the end I based my decision on the emotional impact, nil, and the amount of depraved muck I had to watch to 'get' the satire, the satire being the redeeming factor of the film for me until I realised that it wasn't satire at all. It was glorification of debauchery. In films that satire a particular group such as the politicians in Dr. Strangelove we see them as inept fools and know exactly the people in real life they reference. At no point do any of the nine depraved rich come across as fools or can they be referenced to a particular person in reality. Only the Jesus character comes across as a fool. The other fools portrayed in the film are actually the normal people, i.e. you and me, who buy into the nine's images and marketing strategies. The audience. And that sickens me to the core. That he mocks the people of the world while at the same time the film is lauded by those same people buying into it's 'image' even when it is so obviously gross and depraved.So the evil rich at the end gain enlightenment or truth, while the rest of us wallow in the mire forevermore. A purely evil theme if ever I've seen one and obviously I can't get behind that.I probably went into this film way too open minded first time around, to the point where I had convinced myself I just needed an open mind to enjoy it. I had a chuckle at the art (satire?) scene where asses paint the new 'masterpieces'. But for a two hour film with only one memorable scene, the scene that is probably an allegory for the film that presented it, that's not good enough.My conclusion is that unlike real art from the renaissance period where artists tried to capture the real world as perfectly and beautifully as possible, the same can be said of poetry trying to capture emotion or books trying to create fantastic adventures etc, this would be art, however, the advent of 'modern' artists in both the painting world and the cinema world has left an ongoing legacy of pure muck on canvas and film reels parading as art, this film achieves nothing artistically, it is not moving and emotional, it is not epic, it is not beautiful, it's not even entertaining for most of it, it's just a shock to the system for most people and fear of calling down the wrath of the critics or for being called out for not 'getting' it people laud its brilliance. This sort of 'art' is forced and is clearly not made to inspire and invigorate the soul and for all these reasons I'm out.Even if this was art, what can we compare it with in our own experience to say that it is beautiful, there is no reference point in reality for something like this, not like a symphony stirring up emotions, or the awe of amazing landscape or portrait paintings or an uplifting or sombre story. This has none of the above, If this is solely an intellectual film, then I say to all these pseudo intellectuals to go out and get a PHD in physics or something and stop convincing us of your great intellect by saying you 'get' this utter nonsense."
11,The Holy Mountain,1,24 March 2009,More Like Holy Crap!,"Forget about the war on drugs and the war on terror! It's about time someone declare a war on pretentiousness!The emperor has no clothes, people! Some pretentious eggheads shout down from their lofty perches, telling the masses that this is the movie for the ""in crowd"", for the intellectual, for the enlightened, and you all jump on the bandwagon! Nobody wants to be left behind.Surrealist imagery without a real plot is but a trick by the untalented to steal your money without having to write a real screenplay or tell a real story. It makes people wonder if they're ""too dumb to get it"", so they fill in the holes themselves, all so they can be smart too.In reality Holy Mountain and it's predecessor Fando & Lis are just silly garbage from a silly, so called director. The only thing that separates him from other bad directors is his shamelessness when it comes to using the moving image as a grift.In other words, if you try to make a good movie and fail (like Ed Wood), then you're a hack. Sling a bunch of silly ""surrealist"" images together without trying, then you're considered a genius by a bunch of sheep.Jodorowsky is a con man who should return the money he stole from unsuspecting movie-watchers."
12,The Holy Mountain,1,14 January 2014,"Gawd, I hate hippies trying to be interesting/spiritual/controversial!","Animals were harmed while making this movie. But it's ""art"" so that's okey, right?! My mood was also seriously harmed by this movie by the way. The entire two hours or so is nothing but obnoxious drivel. ""But we're not trying to force a meaning onto you..."" Whatever! Everybody who was involved in making or spreading this movie ought to be shot in the neck! Wasted time. Wasted money and resources. I love weird films: Brazil, Stalker, Naked Lunch, and many more, I even sat through Enter the Void(!). A good movie should provide with either a good story, beautiful cinematics, interesting dialogue, provoking ideas, stuff like that. It should please either the eyes or the mind, this piece of junk insults both.Yes, this is my first review and I made an account just to warn people for this pretentious crap, many of the other reviews going like ""Wow this is so deep and beautiful and intellectual!"" NO. IT'S. NOT! It's just random crap from some bunch of hippies who feel they got too little attention in art school and are afraid of not sticking out in the big bad world of normal serious good people going about their actually interesting lives."
13,The Holy Mountain,1,23 November 2006,Russ Meyer  on LSD,"This has to be one of the most disappointing films ever made. The beginning promises well with some low-grade Bunuel rip-offs, but quickly descends into exploitative pseudo-meaningful porn with some deliberately sensationalist sequences that undermine the quality of the stream of random set-pieces with which it begins.The film takes a massive downturn when the director cops out and introduces speech, which makes it appear that he has run out of ideas and cannot sustain the momentum. The dialogue that ensues is pretentious and insubstantial, which makes it appear as though the director is so unhappy with having had to introduce a narrative that he has attempted to mask the comparatively tedious action with it.This film is definitely of its time and indebted to the 60s notion of free love that in actual fact meant free love for men who exploited women in the process. The imagery towards the end of the film becomes repetitious and most of the acting is appallingly bad and at times laughable. If this film perhaps did not take itself too seriously then we might have had a half-decent curio, but as it is, it becomes a self-indulgent piece of tawdry exploitation.Unsophisticated drivel."
14,The Holy Mountain,1,19 December 2010,What a load of crap,"I'm sorry, but this ""film"" (if it can be called that) is the biggest pile of you-know-what I have ever seen. And trust me, I have seen some absolutely shocking films.This is supposed to be an ""Art Cinema Classic""? If I took enough LSD whilst holding a pen and paper, I can cook up enough references to religion, politics and spirituality and come up with something a thousand time crazier than this, but at the same time keep it simple enough for everyone to understand just what the hell is going on. And if a film maker wants to pay me a load of money to turn it into a film, it would contain imagery that'll blow even Jaradowsky's brain into pieces.Basically the formula for coming up with film can be simplified into this;LSD + A hippie director + 70s +naked men & women+ some crazy times = The Holy Mountain.There are a lot film down the history where I really wanted to get back the 2 hours I'd wasted watching it, but this one took the biscuit. Please oh please from now on when releasing the film like this, can the censor board make sure to put the ""DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS FILM"" in big red writing on the advertising and the DVD package before release.Absolute load of crap!"
15,The Holy Mountain,,31 October 2001,"Pretentious, Boring, but not a total waste","I refuse to be condemned by the art-house snobs for not liking this movie. People read way too much into a lot of different art, and it doesn't make them some special visionary. Sometimes artsy fartsy crap is just that. This movie is not ""above"" you intellectually or artistically. The Holy Mountain is essentially a collage of wacky, strange, self-important images and scenes that really don't mean anything. Don't you ever wonder? There's a reason these rare, cult movies have only been seen by a small percentage of the population. It's not because we're better than the ""unwashed, uncultured masses"". It's because if the movie was actually really good it would be more widely seen. It's because some of us heard about these obscure, cult movies and actually took the time and energy to seek them out. And sometimes we just weren't that impressed. (Okay, and maybe it's because some jerk has held the release rights hostage for entirely too long).Now having said all of that, I still don't think it is a waste of time to watch. How can I say that? Well, the bottom line is, people forget the notion that at the end of the day, not everything has to mean something. Shouldn't we be allowed to take in interesting or different images, films, etc...without decoding their grand vision? Yes, we should. So there are some pretty weird scenes and visions to behold in this movie. And for nothing more than the novelty of it it isn't a total waste of film. I also liked some of the music. But please spare me the ""so far ahead of it's time, magnificent work of artistic expression"" crap. You're taking it way too seriously. The Holy Mountain is not a landmark, it's a novelty of bizarre underground cinema. Nothing more."
16,The Holy Mountain,10,9 May 2016,A rare film in so many ways,"While some may see this as an overblown art film, I've seen a lot of art films (I'm looking at you Matthew Barney) and this surpasses that, or perhaps sets the standard. People have written their Master's Thesis on this film, so reviewing it seems almost superfluous, but since it's one of my standard films to show people who are willing to watch it, and since I've seen it more times than I can count, I thought I'd start this new account with this film as I re-watched it yet again recently and it's been on my mind. I've come to the realization that whatever you get out of this film, and whatever you take away, it's still worthwhile. That isn't some ambiguous ""all interpretations are valid because art"" statement. There are some pretty clear things in this film, it's just that whether you see it as disgusting, pornographic, bombastic, silly, weird, trippy, brilliant, or transcendent you're kind of neither right nor wrong. It's also hilarious. I think this is one of those films where people think they aren't supposed to laugh, but please do. Laugh, it's part of the process. There are parts in this film that are really just very funny, and that's probably no accident.If I recall this film was uniquely sponsored, and due to the backing and free reign Jodorowsky was able to largely do what he wished with it, which is often the kiss of death for a film but in this case allowed a unique creation that may in some ways define the potential of film to this day. It's a low budget film that uses that exact quality to full potential, spending on what needs to be stunning and offering a level of surreal and poetic imagery that blows most films in the genre away. Whether you see this film as a skewering of spirituality or a sincere attempt to get one to consider it and what a film can mean in that context, it still proves a valuable watch.This film is very confusing and works both on a confusingly direct level and a strange subconscious one. One note is that this was definitely not made in a time and place where nudity or violence was off the table. No one can say no animals were harmed in the making of this, and it's questionable whether any people were too.Still, if you have any interest in watching what is pretty much the iconic film-as-art standard bearer, don't skip this one. In fact, watch it as many times as you can."
17,The Holy Mountain,4,18 June 2007,"Not amused, to say the least","Following Jodorowsky's 1970 movie ""El Topo"", ""Holy Mountain"" presents more of the same: a post-modern reworking of reworking, a continually tangential relationship of story and aesthetics, a musing upon the nature of symbols religious, political, social, and economic, and a carnivalesque drama featuring dead or dying animals, freaks, tarot-cards, mysticism, and just about anything else he wants to shove in there for good measure. It's a lot more structured than ""El Topo"", but it's still the same idea... allow a character to travel through many different spiritual contexts to come to some ultimate understanding--wait, no ultimate understanding, and no ultimate ""coming to"", because as soon as it seems like the movie might actually be concluding, well, there's another whole continuation to take into account.Once again I find myself caught up with my own desire to see more pretentious art-house style experimental movies and the inability to appreciate Jodorowsky's film. In this case, his ""ah, but this is actually just a movie after all"" ending, which fits perfectly with his post-modern intentions, is still an almost insulting let down to an audience that has been following this guy for TWO HOURS! To have the sum of all the individual parts add up to, ""But this is just a movie and it can't answer the questions we have about the nature of the universe"" is not only a let-down, but obnoxious... we know it's a movie, and frankly we're here to see what Jodorowsky thinks about it. Tellingly, he doesn't come to any conclusion at all... it's just a play of images and motifs, restructured symbols and deconstructed signs, with a few tongue-in-cheek flippant disregards for commercial value.So sure. He can have his fun. But if I'm going to watch something that goes nowhere, I prefer it not actually go anywhere instead of literally leading me on a pilgrimage to do it.--PolarisDiB"
18,The Holy Mountain,1,4 October 2010,An Artist Honest Review,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, and is the perfect itemized list of everything wrong with ""ART"" Films. I'm an Artist, I studied painting at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. While i was there i had (was forced) to watch this film 3 times and not only can I say how much I disliked it but I'll tell you from the Bottom of my heart that this is the symbol of everything thats wrong with Modern Art.As an Artist I made 1 very important rule that I'll live by for the rest of my life. Never EVER make art for Artists. Anyone of you other reviewers who gave this a great review, let me ask you. If i were to take the movie and play it for random people on the street of downtown Chicago, New York, LA, do you think the majority will like this film? how about understand this film? will it change their lives? will it inspire them? will it give any idea what so ever in their heads besides ""what's the quickest way to run away from this garbage""????I Guarantee, GUARANTEE!!! they won't. They'll be asking Who, What, When, Why, and How so much that it really defeats the whole purpose of ""Visual Communication"" doesn't itThat is the key here, ""Visual Communication"".... This film communicates to people the same way a stereotype homeless crazy person does. So if you understood it, you'd have to be crazy or delusional. Don't dare say its an Artist thing either, I'm an Artist and I've seen it 3 times and still don't understand it. In fact all it did was fuel my hate for this movie. Art is a powerful thing that shouldn't be used to describe a film that makes no sense to a common-minded individual.All films ARE in fact ART. and using Art as the only description for any movie should be the word of warning of how ass it will be, and the director should be labeled as a total pretentious prick from now till the end of time, space, and matter.I'd sooner recommend castration than watching this movie for any normal human and I'm Dead serious. If you want to know how not to make a movie I'll save you the trouble of watching this movie. JUST MAKE SENSE TO A NORMAL FREAKING PERSON YOU JACKASS"
19,The Holy Mountain,,16 November 2004,Surrealism with symbols,"The major problem with Alejandro Jodorowsky's films is that the imagery does not stand alone; it stands for something else. The essence of surrealism, of course, is its lack of rational coherence, its absence of logic and meaning. The images in 'Un Chien Andalou' were dreamt up, while Jodorowsky's are contrived. He imposes meaning and does not seem to believe in free association. He is, in a word, didactic.'The Holy Mountain,' an improvement upon his muddy cult epic 'El Topo,' begins promisingly enough with an eerie, wordless prologue in a temple in which the heads of two women are shaved by a cloaked deity as an initiation rite. The imagery here is striking, as is the imagery throughout most of the film, but I dare say it'd all be a lot more significant with the volume muted.What follows is, initially, strained attempts at blasphemy serving alone as satire on Christianity, with a Christ-like figure smoking herb and making kissy-kissy with a limbless midget, and then happening upon a Christ factory (representing Christianity as a commercial product, in case you're slow). Following this, we see a reenactment of the Mexican revolution with a cast of frogs. After this display, our hero is led into the peak of a tower through a rainbow-colored corridor, where an alchemist locks him in a retort and his excrement is transformed into gold. Pelicans appear. The movie evolves again, this time into a satire on consumerism.This initially striking feature becomes more grating as time wears on, and the juvenile tone of its satiric statement seriously compromises the power of its visual compositions. My heart sank as the film drifted further away from ambiguity and abstraction into the land of the cerebral and polemical. Jodorowsky is more suited for comic art and graphic novels than films, as the reconciliation between literal ideas and otherwise abstract images here is poor. Jod himself appears unmasked in the final scene, with a revelation that seems wrongheaded and smug."
20,The Holy Mountain,,21 August 2007,John Welsey Harding,"For me, there are a variety of ways to encounter a film  or any piece of art  and consider it worth existing in my life.Perhaps the most sought is art that is like a lover: honest, direct, deep, challenging, attuned. Then there are all sorts of seductions that play on these harmonies. Jodorowsky isn't interested in being true; he's interested in the seduction, in a sort of truth lingerie that teases and charms.I knew this of course. I've seen ""Fando,"" which I considered without merit, in large part because it was uncinematic. I wondered what this man would do once he learned the vocabulary. Now I know. The first part of this project has some of the most creative and effective cinematic stretches I have seen  and I've seen a lot. They are weighed down with an adolescent cosmology, but its acceptable because its a proudly Mexican film, and the Mexicans are presented as similarly limited.So I'll recommend that you watch this, for all the bits from the beginning up until roughly the middle act where his new Tarot is presented. These are more well thought out than it appears. Its a strange, polar mix: the general impression is that this is wholly ad-libbed with a deep anarchist philosophy. Yet some elements  and particularly his redrawing of the more colorful segment of the Tarot  show some similarly deep understanding of what he undercuts. Its a very appealing thing, this bicameral scintillation, and done with cinematic immersion.Its the third act that drags. This is not a man who understands long form and its demands. Perhaps the Quay brothers are his successors and they suffer from the same problem. Anyway, the effort gets dreary as the social commentary is paraded before us, almost as if he cannot help himself. The lack of restraint is an art in itself, the art of disappointment, but I can get that in daily life, and with as much pride and flourish.The end isn't novel: the crew is revealed as the ""final layer"" is peeled off the onion. But it is effective, and underscores the similar, earlier folds.What's interesting is wondering now how this could be done better if it were done now. Quite apart from the structural flaws, would the ability to use special effects technology and computer reality help? Would Rodriguez, for instance be able to sharpen and deepen this?And the sexual bits. There is a fair amount of nudity, but it is the ""Catholic nation"" kind: sterile, even when actual sex is supposed to be shown. For such a committed anarchist, one wonders. Its one thing to be just outside of the bounds of acceptable behavior in a theater setting: simple nudity and confrontation works there. But here, in a cinematic world that dips beyond the theatrical, is it enough to merely pretend you are committed, showing that you are not? Winterbottom? Greenaway?If you see this on the restored DVD, there's a nice short feature on the Tarot, just the 22 cards. It oddly doesn't show the Jodorowsky version of those cards, which you can see in the film. Those cards are every bit as engaging as the film is, even though to look at them you have to stop and leave the film to see them. They aren't just an interpretation, but a whole new reimagining.Here's a little known bit of history that I participated in. The Beatles wanted to reinterpret Tarot in an album, and had more success than here. Dylan too, and several other artists in their respective worlds. Jodorowsky was a part of this, a bit later. If you look, you can see that he is not just reinterpreting the Marseilles Tarot, but the Beatle/Dylan/Fowles one as well.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
21,The Holy Mountain,1,11 December 2007,"Pink Flamingos minus white trash, plus Jesus.","I am shocked. I am sickened. I want the last 2 hours of my life back. I want to get at my brain with an eraser. Some images should probably not ever be put on film. I truly hope that as I mail this back the red envelope gets lost and they don't ever press any more DVDs of this. The ATF could use this film to torture people out of their homeschooling arms-hoarding compounds if they could figure out how to put it on every TV screen in the compound. Not only am I aghast that this film was made in the first place, but someone took the time to restore it for a DVD!?! (by the way, I would say that they did an excellent job of restoration). There were some minorly intriguing scenes, and the film is a bit of a quest for something. I won't give away the ending, but I can say that you will either laugh yourself silly or be sorely disappointed."
22,The Holy Mountain,1,18 May 2010,A piece of sh!t,"This movie is utter crap. How on earth it has got a ratting of 7.8/10 is kind of inhuman thinking. This movies is so bad that it could be used as a torture material by the secret organizations of different countries.I have no words to explain how crap this movie actually is. The only other crap movies of the recent years that can even come close to this garbage are Freeway (1996), Mognolia (1999) and the lost Highway (1997).My recommendation: Don't skip it. Download using torrents for free (don't spent a single penny on this sh!t by buying DVD etc)and watch its starting 20 minutes & then if you can't handle its dullness any more, watch it in fast forward to save your time from wasting, but at the same time you will get an idea of how low a movie can get.Absolute disgusting movie with no point what so ever. My ratings 0/10.IMDb please introduce '0' (Zero) on your rating scale for crap movies like this.And IMDb users please, don't be afraid of giving a high-rating-movie on IMDb like this, the actual low ratings which it really deserves. 7.8 for this movie is a crime. Cheers!"
23,The Holy Mountain,10,6 December 2010,Victory,"If i were to try an even attempt to explain any movie Alejandro Jodorowsky has done i would be way off, totally incoherent, babbling. This was the first flick of his i saw, and was IMMEDIATELY blown away. From the opening ten minutes I'm both disgusted, and intrigued. From religion to politics his films capture high volumes of both topics in a very stylish, brutal form. What these films capture on the budget presented is noteworthy, the sets are incredible, the animals used, the freaks, everything plays into the surreal, third eye storm that blows up in your face. It's one of the most conversational movies ever, it forces all of us to think of the implications of the institutions that have been erected, love, hate, all that jazz. I love these films, even though i don't really understand what their about, it's the quest that keeps me coming back. ten stars."
24,The Holy Mountain,7,3 December 1999,A visually stunning but seemingly empty film,"With ""The Holy Mountain,"" Alejandro Jodorowsky creates a film that is visually creative, inspiring, and surreal. It is worth seeing just for some of the beautiful, surreal, and horrific scenes. The music adds nicely too. However, the large part of its beauty is confined to the first thirty minutes or so. The plot and the meaning are somewhat clouded- that assuming there is some reasoning behind it all that this viewer cannot grasp or will not buy. To me, the film seems meaningless and empty- but it comes in a beautiful vase."
25,The Holy Mountain,2,2 November 2014,I cannot understand why people like this movie.,"To each their own I guess. I watched this movie after seeing all you people's 10 ratings and how awesome and life changing it was. One of you went so far as to say it should be considered a ""sacred film"" held equally in esteem next to the Bible and other sacred scriptures. So I gave in....And to you IMDBers who gave this movie a 10, my first question is, what are you people smoking and secondly, how can you call this trash a masterpiece?I get it, society is corrupted and war profiteers and military industrial complex are cancers to our planet and humanity. Reality exists beyond the physical and we are dreaming. But how are cows screwing and old naked guys giving other guys facials relevant to that? Is all this blood, feces and cow semen really necessary to enlighten us of a core message? The only reason I'm rating it a 2 is because the kernels of truth about the corrupted system Alejandro weaves into it and the good intent he seems to have had making this film, I'll give him that.Other than that, it's pretentiously artsy and viscerally offensive garbage, guaranteed to give you a bad trip with or without drugs. This is just one man's opinion, to each their own maybe you'll like it go and see.."
26,The Holy Mountain,9,22 July 2008,Turning excrement into gold,"""The Holy Mountain"", the third film of Alejandro Jodorowsky after his controversial cult-film ""El Topo"", is probably his most polished and interesting work. Basically it combines surrealism, satire, and religious and sacrilege imagery to create a bizarre tale of a group of eccentric characters in their search to reach the immortality. Just like ""El Topo"" the characters have no deep, they are mere symbols to serve the purpose of the story, a story that could be find by some people as pretentious or too strange, but the direction of Jodorowsky made this film something original and unique. There are several elements of satire of modern society, that work very well to introduce us the characters of the story (each symbolizing a planet) their way to reach their goal until a surprising ending (I won't reveal it, but I want to mention that the ending is one of the best that I've seen in a movie, working very well with overall tone of the movie) ""The Holy Mountain"" is a unique film. It was ahead of his time and it is the best work of his director."
27,The Holy Mountain,7,18 April 2008,Hurz,"It must have been some kind of perverted fascination, that kept me watching this work. I won't say movie, because The Holy Mountain defies this definition. It is like Fantasia on a very bad trip, without the beautiful music but with tons of creative imagery.It goes from simply strange to disturbingly revolting back to bizarrely funny and hypnotizingly symbolic. And after that, it does all those things at once. You need a VERY open mind or you won't even begin to feel anything remotely positive towards Jodorowskis piece of art. And art it is.There once was this German comedian who performed in front of some art critics. He sang a very simplistic song about a wolf and a lamb. Than he screamed the word Hurz. And continued singing. That's not art in its common understanding. Hurz doesn't mean anything. It implies a deeper meaning where there is no meaning at all. It distracts from the real intention of the artist.What is the real intention? To fool the audience.This movie is 109 minutes of Hurz. You can over-interpret the symbolism and search for a meaning until your brain hurts. But you will never know the directors intention, because there is no way to tell what is earnest commentary on society, religion or similar important matter and what's just complete and utter nonsense.You think, you found the meaning? You were fooled! You think, there is no meaning? You were fooled!Hurz!"
28,The Holy Mountain,10,12 August 2006,Speechless,"People hear about this movie and its crazy plot and are usually disgusted. Don't let this get to you. Yes, it can be hard to watch at times but it's metaphorical language will begin to grow on you.If you have heard about the extremely sexual premise of many scenes and the esoteric set designs and acting, you heard correctly. There are points in this film that make you wonder how the director went about casting people into these rolls. ""The Holy Mountain"" will open up your mind to new ideas and philosophies. It may even make you more interested in subjects of taboo. Alejandro Jordowsky's other film, El Topo, is great, but not as edgy and wonderfully strange as ""The Holy Mountain"". Pick it up A.S.A.P."
29,The Holy Mountain,,30 May 2001,Holy Hill of Beans!,"This film really is - to use one of Jodorowsky's favourite metaphors - excrement, but I will at least give it some credit for some innovative art direction.  But come on! Everyone's calling it brilliant but no one can really say what it's about.  That's okay, a lot of art is a personal thing that reaches people in a myriad of ways.  But then they claim that it can only be appreciated by those who are well read on a variety of religions. Oh, it's elitist art!  A-ha!  If you don't ""get it"", you must be pretty illiterate, except gee, they can't figure it out either. Well, as a Jewish-born Buddhist who has done an extensive amount or reading and traveling in my lifetime, I got it.  ""Life is an illusion"". I'm so glad I'm well-read, I never would have figured that out!Like ""El Topo"", this film bombards us with shocking imagery, but that film didn't disguise itself as anything other than mere entertainment with some fashionable religious allegory thrown in.  That film said more about religion than this one because it was a nice balance of light and darkness. Here, it's all dark.  People are s**t (and people eat s**t - hey, this is a Jodorowsky film!). We see countless examples of man's inhumanity to man (notice it's not woman's inhumanity to woman or to man. It's amazing how it never even occurs to these directors to address that issue!).  Jodorowsky has nothing new to say and again, uses piecemeal of religious-babble (including the Tarot which like the I Ching, has pretty much gone out of fashion), to state the over obvious about losing oneself (one self) in order to find oneself.  It offends me as a Buddhist because the film exhorts Buddhist philosophies, but Buddhism is about balance and this film is waaaaaay off balance!  Really, every religion and mythology throughout history has created great stories of beauty, sacrifice, compassion and heroism among the endless stories of cruelty and human slaughter.  Well, you can see which parts have been Jodorowsky's favourites!  This is comic book religion pure and simple.  If David Croenberg was a hippie he would be making films like this.  There's no sense of tragedy for the endless human suffering we see. One can't just dull the audiences senses with grotesque images about the sickness and perversion that is (allegedly) humanity and then stick five minutes in at the end of the film where everyone laughs on a mountaintop.  It's actually quite frightening how people will call depravity without any kind of perspective art, simply because they don't want to feel that they are somehow shallow or stupid or weak or (eegad!) uncool.  It's quite silly really, when can see worse offences on the nightly news.There's a scene in this film early on when Christ (who is always walking around in a g-string, the usual example of Jodorowsky's fear of really exposing the phallus) awakens in a room of hundreds of statuettes in his likeness.  He screams in terror at what has been made of his teachings. I've no doubt that he'd have the same reaction if he saw this film."
30,The Holy Mountain,10,30 November 2016,The Holy Mountain: Review/Analysis,"The Holy Mountain is a 1973 Mexican-American surrealist fantasy film directed, produced, edited, and co-scored by Alejandro Jodorowsky. The film stars Jodorowsky himself as the Alchemist alongside a dearth of diverse and unique characters. The Alchemist enlightens a lost Christ-like figure known as the thief and leads him along with a group of planet leaders (who are all also thieves) to The Holy Mountain to find a group of immortal wise men. In this film analysis, I will explain how the film represents a reflection of our world and how we use religion, society, vanity, war, and material objects to keep us from achieving true enlightenment. After the opening of the film, we are introduced to the thief. The thief is a representation of the tarot card, the fool. When first created, tarot cards were used exclusively to play games. But after a while, tarot cards were used heavily in religion and spirituality. The Fool's tarot card number is zero. Upright, this means innocence. Upside down, it means foolishness. These two readings of the card embody the characteristics and ideals of the thief. The thief meets a dwarf with no hands or arms. The dwarf represents defeat, another tarot card. The thief embraces defeat, innocence, and foolishness until he is captured by the townsfolk. The town is never explicitly named but the town is a representation of the entire world. In the town, people profit off selling religious beliefs as well as the war economy seen through the death of hundreds of toads. Based on the human urge to consume and indulge, tourists throw money at the depictions of religion and war. The thief is taken by the townsfolk because of his uncanny resemblance to Christ. When he wakes up from his drunken state, he sees that his body has been molded hundreds of times over. He becomes very angry and destroys these molds realizing that he was played for a ""fool"" and was used for the profit of others. The thief's reaction can also be seen as a commentary on how Jesus himself might have reacted to such fandom when seen as the messiah. The thief keeps one of the molds to symbolize the burden of being looked at as the creator. The thief gets in a dispute with a priest because of his resemblance to Jesus and is thrown out of the church. The thief then eats the mold's face (eating the body of Christ) and sends it to heaven. The thief becomes the Alchemist's apprentice and is shown other leaders of different worlds who will be taking a journey of enlightenment and immortality with the thief and the Alchemist. Each world leader represents a thief of their own craft. The leader of Venus is the thief natural beauty. The leader of Mars is the thief of peace. The leader of Saturn is the thief of purity. The point is not what they represent, but that they all are thief's and in many ways authoritarians of their worlds. The thief of Earth or the fool represents the thief of forgiveness of sin and punishment or Jesus Christ himself. The opening of the film is a pretext for what steps the world leaders or thieves must take to go on the journey to The Holy Mountain. In the beginning of the film, two beautiful women are stripped of their beauty and self-worth. The leaders all must abandon what connects them to their worlds making them human. This is shown through the burning of their money and molded bodies.The thief and the world leaders (alongside the Alchemist) make their way to The Holy Mountain. On their way, many things happen. The thief is told that he must abandon his relationship with defeat by throwing him overboard. This is when we are shown that defeat isn't real and is merely a burden that the thief has held onto. The group discovers the city below the mountain and it's inhabitants. The group discovers these people think they know of The Holy Mountain and what it means. What the group discovers is that these people are delusional and are lost to their vanity. One man thinks it's about drugs. One man thinks it's about strength. And one man just likes hearing the sound of his own voice. The idea is that these things are what are holding them back from true self-enlightenment. This is why the Alchemist had the group detach themselves from what they were in order to take this journey. On their way up the mountain, each member of the group sees their deepest fears and desires. This shows that they too still are clinging on to their past humanity. Once the group finds the immortals, the Alchemist takes the thief aside to send him home. The thief is sent home because he as a Christ figure couldn't properly understand what comes next. What does come next is the realization that it was all a hoax. Or so it seems that way. The Alchemist explains that the journey was never about immortality. But rather, reality. Reality is the true enlightenment. Trying to understand religion or immortality is a useless task. Understanding what is, is what is most important. The Alchemist tells this to the audience because the film isn't about the enlightenment of the people in the film. It is about the people watching it.The Holy Mountain is Alejandro Jodorowsky's most acknowledged and acclaimed film for a reason. It has so much to say with such a simple message. The confusion of understanding the film is the confusion we all have understanding reality and ourselves. It may seem so simple. But without the proper knowledge, we become lost to the world. It was the film Jodorowsky was put on this Earth to make. It truly sets the standard for symbolism and surrealism in film and remains one of the most important films ever made."
31,The Holy Mountain,10,6 September 2016,One of the best movies ever created,"My personal favorite of the Alexandro Jodorowsky's films I've seen, and one of the current three films I have given a 10/10. The movie stars a cast of mostly silent characters who search for something beyond mortality and the ignorance of mankind, only to discover something even greater. This movie has some of the best surrealism I have ever seen in a movie if not the best. However it should be said that surrealism doesn't work just by its own. If it's just random iconography disbanded from a context, It looses all importance and meaning, effectively rendering it to be pretentious screen fodder. This movie however uses its stunning visual effects to convey messages on a level deeper and more complex than blatantly shoving it in your face. It's well used and effective. This movie plays with the themes of war, violence, conditioning, love, art, sex, humanity, fear, sorrow, childhood, and experience. The movie represents different cultures, ideologies, factions, and arts as their own planets to show how alien each is from one another, yet how they all come together to achieve enlightenment. 10/10 movie and a must watch."
32,The Holy Mountain,10,20 March 2016,Almost Impossible to Capture in a Review...,"""The Holy Mountain"" is a film that one must truly experience to get a grasp of. It certainly isn't anything you could describe. it's simply just too strange, beautiful, and brilliant to give a mere description of!In ""The Holy Mountain"", Alejandro Jodorowsky manages to make something that is truly new and original; it is something that only Jodorowsky could make. It is a weird, surrealist experience! At times it can be mystical and magical, at others it is quite disturbing and horrifying. There's definitely certain visuals in this film that you will never forget, whether that's positive or negative depends on your personality.Experimenting with various concepts and visuals, ""The Holy Mountain"" is an avant garde masterpiece full of fascinating symbolism, satire, and surrealism."
33,The Holy Mountain,10,25 October 2015,"""Real life awaits us"".","The Alchemist: ""We began in a fairytale and we came to life, but is this life reality? No. It is a film. We are images, dreams, photographs. We must not stay here. Prisoners! We shall break the illusion. This is magic! Goodbye to the Holy Mountain. Real life awaits us"".The story is about a Christlike figure wanders through bizarre, grotesque scenarios filled with religious and sacrilegious imagery. He meets a mystical guide who introduces him to seven wealthy and powerful individuals, each representing a planet in the solar system. These seven, along with the protagonist, the guide and the guide's assistant, divest themselves of their worldly goods and form a group of nine who will seek out the Holy Mountain, in order to displace the gods who live there and become immortal.The Holy Mountain is one of those movies that not everyone is going to like, as through out the years the movie has been a mix bag for a lot of people. Many called the movie ""A pretentious arty film, with no plot and nothing to gaps on to"". If you don't like this movie then that's fine, I mean everyone has different taste in movies and not everyone can like the same thing as other people because that will be quite dull. But in my personal opinion, I love The Holy Mountain and I would actually rank it up as one of the best movie I've seen in years.Alejandro Jodorowsky (The director of the movie) is what a call a ""spiritual director"", and what I mean is that Alejandro is a very spiritual person and I'm not such a spiritual person myself but I do admire his work. Alejandro Jodorowsky work of art is so open and so transparent that it makes his movies truly unique to watch, and that's why I think The Holy Mountain is a great way to start watching Alejandro films so you can get use to he's style of film making. Everything Alejandro Jodorowsky puts into his art as a personal sense of purpose in them and the ideas he's got isn't difficult to make out in each scene of the movie. The Holy Mountain is a work of art and Alejandro Jodorowsky directing is freaking superb.What I love about The Holy Mountain is how every single scene in this film is so true on reality and how detailed the movie is, and all of that is shown by Alejandro artistic look on life. The movie is absolutely absurd and what I mean is without spoiling anything; these a scene where a women is sitting on this super tall toilet and I'm not going to break it down like most people have by saying, ""The toilet is suppose to represent her as an upper class citizen to everyone"", no, what the movie is trying to get across (In my opinion) is how absurd it is and to make you think twice about the things we take for granted, I mean just look at everything that's still current in present day life, back in the sixties, seventies and eighties are still present today and all the things we do are suppose to me you think ""Wow, that's retarded"", and the point of the movie is to look at all the things that have become normality makes you realize it's absurd.These a lot that you can interpret in terms of statements that's in the movie like politics, religion and social life, and the movie says so much about every issue and it's so true and timeless. Every single second of the movie is making a statement and the movie has some much to say that it doesn't waste it's time doing so.The soundtrack in this movie is one of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to. Alejandro Jordorowsky, Don Cherry, Ron Frangipane and Andrew Arnold were the composers and I thought they did a magnificent job. The music in the movie really dose help on what type of emotion your suppose to be getting from the scene. Once you watch it a few times and you understand everything that's going to happen in the scene and you get the music in your head at the same time really adds to the experience, well it did for me. Now for the problems: I have none.Overall The Holy Mountain is a fantastic movie that really connected with me as a viewer. The movie never sloppily pretends to be doing anything different; all of it is completely self-ware of itself. The movie isn't for everyone so if you didn't like this movie then that's totally fine, but I freaking love this movie."

People who hold this film in contempt, are not going to be much fun. I've seen ""Fando and Lis"" but not yet ""El Topo."" I'm happily surprised to see that a sequel to ""El Topo"" is evidently in the offing per IMDB. Or maybe that has been the case for the past 20 years...If you typically like ""experimental"" film (and I mean stuff like what the Ann Arbor Film Festival showcases not say Cronenburg's ""Spider""), then you should be able to sift enough gold out of this film. But there is plenty of gold's alchemical opposite as well.Imagination erupts out of this film like birds out of bullet holes. The plot with its quasi-mystical, anti-corporate kaleidoscope of world religions is there just to connect the dots between artistic film. As such, you could call this a fantastic film, but a horrible movie. In fact, the more seeming contradictions you can utter and pretend to understand, the more you will enjoy the spare dialog throughout this.The fact is you will be lucky to find it, at least for now. The japanese version I came across did have genitalia replaced by white splotches...it did sort of dampen the hippie heresy vibe, but the Don Cherry assisted soundtrack more than made up for that.A lot of the set design, especially when then set spinning was visually inviting for me. It would be fascinating to know more about this film, what did the extras think as Jodorowsky was guiding them on his very obscure personal vision? How much did this film cost him to make...despite its off-the-cuff vitality, it clearly was not made with spare hubcaps and rubber bands.The mingling of myth is fun, and while some folks may use this to slake their spiritual thirst, or satisfy their supernatural hunger, I'm not yet ready to buy into the chakra and awe. Who are we? Why are we here?For me, I just wondered, how did Jodorowsky make this film?And yes I am glad that he did...6/10"
36,The Holy Mountain,4,11 November 2008,"Beautiful images, barmy action","Finally I have had the opportunity to take in this reverently spoken-of film. It is clear that Alejandro Jodorowsky, the creator or perhaps the magus at the centre of the film is serious but not sombre. This attitude permeates this film, a narrative study of the alternative life philosophies emerging from the previous decade: there is humour to be had.The basic story is one in which a fallen Christ joins a group of acolytes on a journey to the mountain of the title. The images are wonderful. Full use is made of the strong Mexican light, locations and colours to create a cumulative tableaux of surreal images. The acting is an odd subject as it's clear that the cast regard Jodorowsky not only as director but also as more or less the guru he is acting. Their roles are treated with the reverence that one finds in the theatre of religious services.I take nothing from the narrative or its propagated beliefs. I didn't much care either for the hackneyed (even in 1973) sexual/corporeal fetishim deployed as an antagonistic substitute for drama at the opening and beyond. It's the extraordinary images and scenes constructed with care and conviction that I absorb, gratefully, from seeing this film. 4/10"
37,The Holy Mountain,10,7 June 2002,Either you get it or you don't,"This film is profound on so many levels (whether you agree or not is your opinion - the fact is that it is) but at the same time it doesn't want you to read too much into it. The ending is the main thing that totally blows you away. This film is not crap. It is a significant piece of cinematic art.  Most prints are duplicates of the Japanese laserdisc (widescreen with the nudity fogged out and Japanese subtitles). Most people who have seen this movie ARE, in fact, intellectuals. Let's face it - mainstream films are mindless violence or idiotic teen movies - not much more. I looked for this film because I found El Topo and Santa Sangre highly appealing. Thank God for eBay is all I can say - it's been a Godsend in finding these rarities that belong to the truly deserving people who appreciate them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
38,The Holy Mountain,6,1 August 2000,The ascent of Mt. Carmelo with surrealistic dressing,"The film is based on The Ascent of Mt. Carmelo, by the spanish mystic San Juan de la Cruz, one of the closest catholic relatives to new age and buddhism. Only instead of Mt. Carmelo, we find Jorodowsky climbing the towers of Satelite, the shrine of suburban mexican middle class! I found it a great idea that, hidden in those towers, there is a gate to nirvana (the characters are hairless, for they have given up their selves).The first scenes (the conquest of Mexico with frogs and lizards, in the middle of the Basilica de Guadalupe) are great; the ending gives some enlightment. In the middle, you get the usual Jodorowsky salad dressing: freaks, blood, meaningless words, put there to make you feel you're watching something sooo bizarre and sooo special you are, alas, a ""chosen"" person.P.S. I believe the date of release is 1974. But I am not 100% certain."
39,The Holy Mountain,10,27 September 2010,"psychedelic, surrealistic trip","It is very hard to describe this movie. This is probably the hardest review I ever had to write. (It's hard enough, since my native language is not English.) Everything is absolutely surrealistic and unusual. I have never seen anything similar. This movie even goes a step further than David Lynch or Terry Gilliam. Everything can be taken as a symbol - or even as persiflage, since everything is exaggerated or ridiculed. The visuals are partly so crazy, that it almost feels like a walk through a modern art museum. Sometimes you get the feeling, that the director had the ultimate brain storm experiment going on; taking the paint brush, not knowing what you are going to paint and simply watching your hand. - Your subconscious will start to combine the weirdest symbols with each others. Partly the movie is abstract art, partly it's self-conscious constructed. On this journey the movie will allude a lot existential questions - in the search of an answer. It will not actually give an answer though.This movie has more music in it than conversations. Something I really liked, because mostly the music fit perfectly. The visuals are experimental but worked out most of the time. Compared with other movies of the same age, everyone will have to admit, that the movie is visually on a very high level. I give this 10 points. For the courage of the director making a movie that is as experimental as this one, and because I still have to ponder about this movie 2 days after watching it. - And I actually plan to watch it again. This film might be the most interesting experiment in movie history."
40,The Holy Mountain,9,13 December 2007,Go Tell It From The Mountaintop...,"This is the Alejandro Jordowsky film not the old silent one about mountain climbing, anyway this film had pretty much everything I wanted out of a movie. I've had it now for about a week and I've watched it over and over. Every frame is visually engaging, it's probably the most symbolism heavy film I've ever seen, but not in an eliptic David Lynch, these are symbols, not emblems, and they represent ideas not included in the film as opposed to representing ideas in the film, simple right? Its a pinnacle merger of surrealism, satire, philosophy, and science fiction. The sets, the images and the story itself blow me away, and the ideas though chaotic at first flow together seamlessly in the conclusion.This is not a druggie film with no plot and a bunch of crazy stuff, it might appear that way if you view it on drugs, or with no attempt to think about what appears on the screen after it's gone, but the film itself is actually quite complex, almost too complex. Jodorowsky is weaving together a lot of escoteric threads and symbols(the first scene is the Japanse Tea Ceremony) together to tell an quite simple story about the various ways we(and the contemporary audience of the 70's) attempt to escape death. If you interested in watching a gifted film maker at the height of his game paint a truly unique portrait of the world, look no further. If you want something truly bizarre and different because you've seen everything, see it. If you don't care much for symbolism, allegory, or metaphor, avoid this at all costs, there is no realsim here, but there is brilliance, and I don't use that word lightly."
41,The Holy Mountain,,26 November 2003,"Fascinating, boring, beautiful, ugly, irritating, pretentious, witty and profoundly original. 'The Holy Mountain' will blow your mind!","'El Topo' is still one of the strangest movies ever made but Alejandro Jodorowsky amazingly managed to top himself with 'The Holy Mountain'. This movie contains some of the most weird and wonderful scenes in the history of movies. It is filled with bizarre images which draw upon many religions and occult philosophies, and seems to be inspired equally by Bunuel and the comic book sci-fi surrealism of William Burroughs.  It's a cliche but when I say you have to see it to believe it I'm not lying! The movie is roughly in three sections. The first documents the trials and tribulations of The Thief, a Christ figure. The second introduces The Alchemist (played by Jodorowsky himself) and his seven disciples who are each represented by a planet. The third sees all these odd people (and a chimpanzee) go on a pilgrimage to ""The Holy Mountain"". I found the third section to be much less interesting than the other two, and that, combined with the sensory overload of the earlier parts of the film, makes it not as successful as 'El Topo' for me. But there's no denying that this is an extraordinary movie and anyone who appreciates strange and challenging films will find this to be the strangest and most challenging of all. Jodorowsky makes David Lynch look like Michael Bay! I can't truthfully say I get 90% of what he's getting at but boy, is it a trip trying to figure it out!"
42,The Holy Mountain,2,21 November 2012,"Pretentious, doesn't do anything for me","The film for me wasn't so much a film as a series of imagery. Despite what the plot of the film states, it doesn't really have one. Much like ballet, if you aren't told what the plot is beforehand you wouldn't have a clue afterwards. Admittedly, there is some good imagery in this film, if you are interested in religion, however the imagery seems to have took precedence in the making of the film and has left the film in itself really quite poor. This, coupled with the many unnecessary scenes within the film has just led to ""The Holy Mountain"" as coming across as very pretentious, which is a trait that I personally cannot stand in a piece of film."
43,The Holy Mountain,10,25 November 2003,"A true ""head' film.","The Holy Mountain (1973) is an acid lovers nightmare. A strange film filled with some of the most intense imagery you'll ever gaze your eyes upon. It's one weird picture I tell you. On the other hand, it's a magical quest for one's true self. A quest to find out what's his or her own purpose in life. A look into your psyche and to experiance life. This film will either enlighten or puzzle you beyond belief. I recommend this film, like it's companion piece El Topo it has scenes that remain with you for a long time. Sadly, just like El Topo it has never been released officially her in the United States. You'll have to find a copy of this movie from your local underground video store.

44,The Holy Mountain,,29 December 2007,"A monumental achievement of philosophy, mysticism and surrealist satire.","The Holy Mountain was director Alejandro Jodorowsky's follow up to the cult western El Topo; a violent and deeply mystical dream play about a mythical gunfighter cleansing himself of the violence of his past, only to find that the world itself had already been corrupted by the bloodshed of the present.The mystical themes are fleshed out even further with The Holy Mountain, Jodorowsky's second of only three films produced in the 1970's, which, much like the preceding El Topo and the director's very first film, Fando é Lis, unfolds through a series of surrealist vignettes rife with religion symbolism, sardonic satire and distancing cinematic shock tactics. To some, it remains a monumental achievement of philosophy, mysticism and surrealist satire; a film capable of changing the viewer's entire perspective on life itself through the wisdom of its central character and the potency of its imagery. To others however, the film has already become a dated relic, with some viewers arguing that extravagant pop-art production design, casual nudity and notions of questing for inner peace and tranquillity have become throwbacks to the late 1960's flower-power aesthetic; which is always easy to discredit through blind cynicism.How will you react to it? I couldn't possibly say, though I would say it's best to approach the film with an open mind and with some familiarity with Jodorowsky's previous, and indeed, subsequent cinematic works, like El Topo, and in particular Santa Sangre, both of which offer an easier gateway into the filmmaker's heavily symbolic world than this epic rumination on life and the cosmos.What surprised me most when viewing the film for the first time was the tremendous amount of depth that can often be lost within the giddy barrage of sights and sounds that burst from the screen in a vibrant vivid collage of philosophy, art, sex and religion. As a result, I often find it annoying when people discredit Jodorowsky as simply throwing images on the screen to shock and disarm the viewer for no apparent reason. I find similar arguments regarding the work of filmmakers like David Lynch and Miike Takashi similarly offencive. Simply listen to the audio commentary on this DVD to hear Jodorowsky taking the film apart image by image; explaining the incredible amount of minor details purged from every religion, steeped in every form of art and combined in an attempt to overload the audience's senses and perceptions to effectively change the very fabric of their own personal universe. It worked for me, though as you can possibly gather from the previous reviews, opinions are mixed.Some will be more open to Jodorowsky's ideas than others. Some will enjoy the colourful scenarios of the opening 30 minutes, which depict the resurrection of a Christ-like character and his corruption by the modern world ravaged by war, dictatorship, organised tourism and the endless pursuit of money. The second half of the film introduces us to the other characters; a collection of evil, greedy business men, weapon designers, factory owners and foot-soldiers who, much like the Christ-like character we meet during the first chapter, decide to abandon the corrupt world in which they exist and quest with the mythical central character to the summit of the holy mountain.As you can imagine from this sketchy plot outline, what follows is fairly episodic in design, sometimes tapping into the cinematic absurdity of Luis Bunuel and at other times reminding me of the epic opulence of early Ken Russell (in particular, films like The Devils, The Music Lovers, The Boyfriend, Mahler, etc). For the most part though, the film is pure Jodorowsky, with the central character (played by the director himself) tapping into the intensity of El Topo's iconic gunfighter, whilst the constant barrage of cripples, dwarfs, freaks and geeks cut adrift against a processions of skinned lamb carcasses, edible Jesus effigies, dog fights and the recreation of the conquest of Mexico, re-enacted with frogs that are later blown to pieces, all recalling the fevered insanity of El Topo, the warped fairytale-like quality of Fando and Lis, the Gothic psychodrama of Santa Sangre and the empathetic compassion of Tusk.Obviously, it's not going to be a film for everyone, but those already turned on to Jodorowsky's ideas will no doubt take away a great deal from the film's central message, and from the dizzying kaleidoscope of visual ideas, interpretations and sight gags that explode from the screen in a veritable barrage of colour and movement."
45,The Holy Mountain,6,27 March 2000,Much of the symbolism was lost with me.,"Religion, mysticism, alchemy and astrology set the mood for this art-house movie, one not expected to win universal favour these days.  It's an episodic documentary that re-enacts much of the suffering and cruelty of past history and man's unceasing struggle to gain enlightenment and immortality which is said to be found on the top of the holy mountain.  The result of Jodorowsky's production is a bizarre mixture indeed.  While some scenes are entirely original and imaginative (e.g. toads in uniforms) other scenes concerning the planets go on for too long and become rather boring and pointless.  Jodorowsky seems to want to shock his audience at every opportunity, and at first he succeeds, but one tends to become immune as shock follows shock.  The version I saw was dubbed in English and frontal nudity severely censored.  Both aspects tend to nullify or distract and most of the impact is lost.  To appreciate this film one needs to be widely read to appreciate the symbolism which permeates the whole movie. I am still trying to figure out the reason for the presence of the little man without hands and feet, and why one needs to surrender body parts to attain immortality.  Man is a most contradictory being.  In the days of the alchemists, he sought the magic principle that would turn all matter into gold, and later through the influence of religion, he had to divest himself not only of his gold, but also of all his earthly possessions before he had any chance of enlightenment.  I think the film starts well but gets lost in its maze of tangled ideas and symbolism."
46,The Holy Mountain,8,7 January 2018,Holly Jodorowsky,"Alexandro jodorowsky, we can do a cinematograph world analysis. a world of moviegoers seeking a new name without stopping, a new name that others do not know. we have to ignore some deficiencies in order to bring up the name that others do not know. we must find the seijun suzuki without ending the mizoguchi, kurosawa. or we should consume 60s of Japanese erotic cinema. ozu, mizoguchi and kurosawa have not been consumed. I am also pleased to have discovered suzuki by means of this mind-blowing fashion designer. but it's always the same: this is the undiscovered ore director, suddenly japanese cinema, korean cinema, and so on, a must-have, mediator iftar, great master. ok suzuki's psychedelic cinema is so much fun, it's impossible to approach a mediocre kurosawa movie. suzuki does not have good movies, has interesting films.a jodorowsky who became a drug sponge in the 1960s and '70s is likewise introduced as the antithesis of the name, ""wow how you do not know, one of the most important directors of the world"". I do not know ... I did not know ... I did not know the valhalla ... now the person who introduced me to the holy mountain is infinite and I'm very happy to watch the movie, I bought a lot. but everything is a native rather than a seat.an interesting film at the outset, not a good movie, the holy mountain. ha is a very interesting movie apart from it. From a visual point of view, Jodorowsky hits the top of the LSD he gets. The exciting fiction of some of the scenes is awesome. we are laughing somewhere, we are staring at arts management, camera management, mizansene admiration. ultimately it's worth the effort we've made to reach a Jodorowsky movie. we do not regret it.but a good movie the holy mountain? If you are not a Catholic, cheap metaphors that ""place"" the Jodorowsky's Catholic Church are not in the mood for a ""no more interesting things"". interesting things, model weapon factory, shudder, again the same cheap sensation, must be provoking in the account, but to its own provocation, to ""fuck you"", to the distance (unnecessarily, because it must be extremely conventional) but at least it's visual. it is not possible to see that the process of modeling, the way in which every image looks like, affects greenaway, and especially wes anderson. but when GreenAway and Anderson are complete artists, their films are ""artifacts"" for the whole, while Jodorowsky stays with the qualities that influence those films. the rest is a world view of hippie bullshit, let's become one with nature, turn into the superior man. the problem is not what you are saying, but the naan that overwhelms the person you are talking about, the uncertainty of your innocence in the cheapness, the knowledge of the whole world ... or the interview in the Filmin DVD is ""sensational, unseen!"" It was a terrific surprise last time in the form of lanterns. So we are destroying the illusion. What are you doing to create the illusion? We did not buy lsd, we are aware, we are not in a bad movie, illusion. it is not unseen, thank God we saw it.it is unlikely that you will end up with these highly effective Catholic films, if you have not taken any drugs. good sides, which are super interesting good things, if I put them aside, my message is shudder: there are very few people who are really good and rediscovered. terrence malick maybe, after the thin red line. or is already discovered a film of an unknown value of a good director; like after hours. please do not change your world with the excitement of discovering jodorowsky. but you can not change the whole cinema history with a director. I'm ordering."
47,The Holy Mountain,1,20 December 2017,huh?,I am so confused. I am a film student so I can appreciate surrealism but wtf is this? I don't feel well. I couldn't finish the film. This will lead me to chain-smoking. Thank you Alejandro Jodorowsky.
48,The Holy Mountain,8,28 August 2017,Visually stunning art movie,"I've just watched this for the first time but feel that it's one of those films that requires several viewings to do it justice, so my review will be brief & simple. A visually stunning, often bizarre movie that features sex, death, religion, violence, drugs, animals, excrement & of course a mountain. Each scene is played out like a work of art, it's a sight to behold. I think that I understood the point of the film but wouldn't dare attempt to try & put into words. Just go & experience it for yourself. ** I'm surprised that here in Britain the BBFC passed it without cutting the dog fighting scene, a ""sport"" that is illegal here & they are often quick to cut out animal cruelty. Yet another of their inconsistencies! **"
49,The Holy Mountain,1,24 July 2017,Insanity at its finest,"This FREAK SHOW never ends ... until the end. I don't think I have ever seen a more useless waste of time and effort. The cast seems to accept low pay in exchange for being in A real MOVIE. HOW can I drag a review on and on and on, as long as 2 hours of boredom. Blasphemy aside,,, NO amount of ANY drug would make this psychosis anywhere near watchable. Just say NO to insanity......"
50,The Holy Mountain,,22 June 2017,10/10 would mutilate again.,"A blokes dick gets cut off and a lady rubs Jesus's asshole. Jesus also throws a cripple in the sea, but the cripple is just a creation of his imagination.Quote of the movie. ""Rub your clitoris on the mountain!!!""I thank you for your read and this movie is most definitely worth a watch if you want a great laugh.(Hard drugs highly recommended before experiencing this masterpiece)Also a monkey"
51,The Holy Mountain,10,3 May 2017,"Dense, symbolism, relevant","The Holy Mountain is frequently described as a cult movie, probably due to its limited box-office success and its sort of new birth through message boards and viral shares. In an era of begpackers and idolized mortals, the film takes a new meaning.Symbolism is everywhere, overwhelming, just like it's meant to be. In this masterpiece, everything seems to have a meaning. The viewer's tossed from surreal costumes to trippy sets like a rag doll, something quite reminiscent of troubled minds, the marginalized of our society, starving for answers. There have been hundreds of Holy Mountains, senseless five-step programs, filthy gurus. Mysthicism always find its way to the suffering mind, suffering being a safe common ground."
52,The Holy Mountain,10,18 April 2016,We Really Need to talk about the Holy Mountain,"Let me just say, although I was not all that impressed by El Topo(I tended to enjoy Fando y Lisa little more), I'm glad John Lennon and Yoko Ono went to see it at a midnight showing. They convinced the Beatles' manager, Alen Klein, to bankroll Jodorowsky's next film, what some would call his most self- indulgent (and consequently most brilliant) the Holy Mountain.Does the film live up to the budget? Let's put it this way, Jodorowsky never made a better film since, even though his concept for Dune would have been brilliant. The Dance of Reality was a pretentious jab at communist discipline and any non-religious approachHowever, the Holy Mountain has always stuck with me as one of the most brilliant films of all of cinema history. I can't help, even as an atheist, feeling shame a being mocked by Jodorowsky's psycho-magic in the documentary about him, Consellation. He, the director who forced his actors to take Psilocybin mushrooms during the ""hump the mountain"" scene. He who, at the end of the film assures that all we have just seen was a film and not actual reality. He who can read your fortune in the tarot deck.I understand why some might be taken in by cults and cult films are called that for a reason. They offer the perfect escape from just the wrong situation. The Holy Mountain is one of those films. And it was genuinely, Babylonianally hedonistic and subversive. You can enter a world where it doesn't matter if you mutilate animals or make bombs into toys. The journey is the same. You might be Jesus of Muhammad, but you're still just in Olympic competition with Zeus and Aphrodite at the Pantheon Bar and it's Karaoke night. A drunk guy can go across the mountain, but he can't ascend because he can only travel horizontally.I love you and I'd like you to know, this film has not always or even often done right by me. As a matter of fact, strict, fundamental adherence to this film could result in some dangerous fundamentalism. Of course Jodorowsky free's you from all that at the end when he declares the whole previous hour and a half simulacrum of reality a film. Just watch it already.this review originally appeared at http://paranoidcinephilia.blogspot.com/"
53,The Holy Mountain,8,31 January 2016,Crazy and wonderful symbolism,"I am still not a 100% sure on the story after a second watch but whatever i watched was funny,crazy, well made and worth watching!It is quite long but stick with it! The metaphors and symbolism are a plenty and it didn't quite make sense in places but i think that is what gives it its charm. You spend most of the time baffled by odd acting and eerie silences! It reminded me a bit of 'Santa Sangre' in that it had a similar feel to it. There is no shortage of the use of dwarfism and limbless people, which i feel gives a strange edge to the film, in the way the characters themselves are perceived. I highly recommend this to people who enjoy similar films to 'el topo' and 'Santa Sangre'"
54,The Holy Mountain,10,25 January 2015,From Base to Summit,"The first thing that came to mind after The Holy Mountain was ""Wow, did that really happen?"". The Holy Mountain is an overwhelming display of genius in many forms, layered on top of each other. From start to finish this movie is surrounded in symbolism that I can't even begin to understand. Underneath is a musical score that pulls you deeper into the movie. The scenery throughout the film ranges from all parts of the mind, a true journey from start to finish. I am writing this review after only one viewing but hope to summit The Holy Mountain many more times and grow to understand it better. This movie is a trip through the surreal and may not be appreciated by all but I would say that it is worth the risk to find out if you will. 10/10"
55,The Holy Mountain,9,2 September 2014,Like nothing you've seen before,"A man dressed like Christ wakes up drenched in his own urine and with a face full of flies. He is awoken and nursed by a group of naked children and an amputee dwarf, the latter of whom accompanies the man into town where people are getting executed and raped while rich tourists take photographs and clap. The Spanish invasion of Mexico is played out with toads and lizards as a crowd watches. Fat men dressed like Romans sell religious paraphernalia, and, after noticing the man's resemblance to Jesus, get him drunk and use his body to make moulds of Jesus on the cross. The man awakens, surrounded by images of himself on the cross. He screams and begins to smash the figures with his bare hands. After this, things begin to get really weird.Hot off the success of his Midnight Movie, the psychedelic, ultra- violent El Topo (1970), Alejandro Jodorowsky was given a decent budget for his follow-up. Experimenting with sleep deprivation, spiritualist meditation and, of course, LSD, the result would be one of the most visually arresting films ever made, and also one of the strangest. The target is religion, but more of man's interpretation of religion to suit his own needs. The Holy Mountain of the title is the key to immortality, but the collection of capitalists, exploiters and thugs who embark on the journey seek all the answers in order to escape the horrors of the world they're directly responsible for.Jodorowsky has a real gift for the image. Whether it's the sublime, kitsch interiors of the Alchemist's (Jodorowsky himself) room, located at the top of a huge tower which the man dressed like Jesus, billed as the Thief (Horacio Salinas), has to ascend perched on a giant hook, or the truly grotesque sight of flayed goats paraded around a town on poles, he knows how to grab your attention. The film switches gleefully between horror, satire, farce and sometimes camp, like the machine that needs to be penetrated sexually with a huge electric phallus before it will open and allow you to operate it. This scene is part of a collection of vignettes that makes up the central section, as we meet the seven chosen to journey to The Holy Mountain.Unseen for around 30 years, The Holy Mountain found itself in distribution purgatory, until it was recently re-released and given the sort of remastering it deserved. It is a kaleidoscope of acid-trip imagery, and Jodorowsky throws politics, sociology and history into the mix to make one enlightening experience. Embracing the free-form storytelling of Federico Fellini and, especially, Luis Bunuel, it may frustrate with it's lack of narrative structure, but artists like Jodorowsky shouldn't be shackled with such formalities. Scandalous, beautiful, horrifying and often baffling, The Holy Mountain is an experience that will no doubt remain with you for days, possibly longer, but whatever your view, it's like nothing you've seen before.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
56,The Holy Mountain,8,21 August 2014,That Rainbow Hallway Is Unforgettable Imagery.,"When I first saw ""The Holy Mountain"", I said to myself I'm definitely going to see it again before I write a review on it. It is an Art film in every sense of the word, and never have I seen a movie of such provocative imagery that was hard to get through on the first viewing. And I've watched Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salo, or the 120 days of Sodom"" (1975). Watching it for the second time, I could finally give it a rating and absorb every prophetic sentence and scene only Alejandro Jodorowsky could execute so well. It's goal is ambitious and admirable and I loved how Jodorowsky managed to provide an ending statement so impressive, it was like Charlie Chaplin's speech in ""The Great Dictator"" (1940).A thief who has a bizarre resemblance to Jesus Christ, lies on the ground. After being strung up on a cross by children he befriends a footless, handless dwarf and both go into a city to make money from tourists. Some locals use the thief's likeness for the crucifixes they sell, by casting an impression of his face and body. The thief soon eats the face of his wax statue and sends it upwards with balloons, symbolising eating the body of Christ and offering ""himself"" up to Heaven. Shortly he notices a crowd gathering around a large tower, where a large hook and bag of gold has been sent down in exchange for food. Wanting to find the source of the gold he ascends the tower and breaks in, finding both the alchemist (Jodorowsky) and his female assistant.After a brief fight with the alchemist, the thief defecates into a container. The excrement is transformed into gold by the alchemist who says: ""You are excrement. You can change yourself into gold"". The thief immediately rejects the gold after being shown himself in a mirror, and the alchemist decides to take the thief on as an apprentice. We are then introduced to seven people who will accompany him on his journey, they are regarded as the most powerful humans on earth but like himself, mortal. These seven consist of a cosmetics manufacturer (Venus), a weapons manufacturer (Mars), an art dealer (Jupiter), a war toy maker (Saturn), a political financial adviser (Uranus), a police chief (Neptune) and an architect (Pluto). All are gathered together and instructed to burn their money and wax images of themselves. Once finished, their plan is to ultimately ascend ""The Holy Mountain"", to gain the secret of immortality from the masters who live there.Though my favourite of all Jodorowsky's works is ""El Topo"" (1970), ""The Holy Mountain"" at the time definitely feels like his most personal project. The only flaws I can find with this movie is the length of inevitable exposition when it comes to describing the seven people. A few scenes that come off unintentionally (Or maybe they were?) hilarious, never destroying the overall message and given the directors filmography, part of it always feels that you are suppose to find it unsettling and funny either way.Final Verdict: Other than that, the film is part eye-candy, part surrealist delight. I don't think I'll ever forget half of what I saw, and it's message never comes off forced and is explained more thoroughly as the narrative proceeds. I cannot help but find a movie of this calibre only comes once every couple of decades. 8/10."
57,The Holy Mountain,7,25 February 2014,your face will contort in confusion,when i began watching it my first thought was. 'ok... something isn't right here. did the reviews [7.8] somehow get screwed up?' then after the initial... lets call it (confusion coupled with mild shock) there was nudity introduced and that kept me watching a little while longer. now keep in mind i don't even like nudity in most films unless its appropriate and given the circumstance it blended in seamlessly.the (confusion/mild shock) continued and even perhaps increased as the video continued. it was about half way completed and 2am. i paused it and went to bed.i woke up and fed the cat etc. etc... sat down and realized this video had been paused and continued watching it. about three quarters of the way through i think i may have understood something. thats right... i had been watching this throughout without a clue. finally satisfied i had figured something out i felt obligated to see it through to the end.i then read a few of the reviews from the highest rated then a few from the lowest. it cleared up some of the confusion. i may watch 'holy mountain' again. why i feel the need to understand or even quasi understand it... i don't know.
58,The Holy Mountain,10,12 January 2014,"Brilliant! ""Seek and ye shall...""","I experienced more raw, refined and direct emotions with my entire being watching ""The Holy Mountain"" than I did by watching many hundreds of other movies... my entire organism participated in this experience: my body, heart, mind, plus whatever other faculties may lie beyond their realms.It's a great movie for Seekers of all levels, all Paths, all orientations, faiths and disciplines.Something about ""The Holy Mountain"" reminded me of the movie titled ""Eraserhead"" (1977); perhaps the level of successfully utilized bizarre imagery. But ""The Holy Mountain"" does not exploit the bizarre for the benefit of the bizarre alone, nor does it feature the bizarre just for feeding and fueling the Spectacle. There's complex feelings and teachings within every visual detail of the compositions, and within every twist and turn of the plot.Something about ""The Holy Mountain"" reminded me of the movie titled ""Circle of Iron"" (1978); it also is a story of Seeking, of being on the Path for spiritual self-realization; transcendence... but ""The Holy Mountain"" definitely goes deeper, and addresses the Seeker~Viewer from multiple, well-informed points of departure all at once.I found the music wonderful. I found the voices of the characters... superb, matching a genuine presence they conveyed that most modern actors today have a hard time rendering. In this respect the movie matches many movies of the counter-culture and the underground created during the revolutionary of the sixties-seventies. Most of the people in ""The Holy Mountain"" are so real that it's hard to distinguish if they are just regular people pretending to be actors, or actors so deeply aware, so brimming with artful dexterity that they appear to be just regular people. Echoes here of ""Zabriskie Point"" (1970), in the sense of having actors who are totally real - so real, that the movie might as well be a staged documentary. ""Obscured by Clouds / The Valley"" (1972) also comes to mind easily because of this quality (and for the them, a journey of discovery and Seeking): and for those who were disappointed that ""The Valley"" did not show enough naked flesh, there's plenty of honest nudity it in ""The Holy Mountain"": probably more than most viewers can handle.The photography is very high quality, and so is the editing. To be honest, I wanted the movie to be longer. And as soon as it ended I wanted to watch it again!"
59,The Holy Mountain,10,22 March 2013,Fresh n Breezy,"The point of the film is that instead of seeking solace in a higher power, or coveting religious, sometimes mystical symbols, you should put your trust in your friends and enjoy your surroundings. Simple. The film is an overload of quasi religious imagery to highlight the absurd hierarchy that exists in most organised religion.Its a very beautiful film and is, in a way, a rejection of 'El Topo', which presented religious myth in a more outwardly serious way. I think Jordorowsky needed to shrug off the shackles of El Topo which was taken very seriously by many, and just put things in perspective.and i don't really want to write ten lines of text, IMDb."
60,The Holy Mountain,8,7 November 2012,Quite a revolting epic expedition,"This is the 2nd most bizarre film to me, after Un Chien Andalou. An alchemist leads 9 people, representing 9 planets in the universe, on a spiritual journey to the Holy Mountain to conquer immortality. Alejandro Jodorowsky drills his surrealistic skill to mock lost mankind and their sinister religion, politics, industrialization, modernization through mystical symbols and sexual imageries. Inner part of the tower, toads' play, giant sex toy, Christ idols factory, ultramodern weapons, in fact the whole setting----an outstanding vision from the director. Every shot depicts a satirical explosion to shiver our mind. Quite a revolting epic expedition that elegantly ridicules modern society in all possible sarcastic ways :p___8/10___NB: the movie might not suit to all for its high (unique!) amount of sexual content and almost incomprehensible style___:/"
61,The Holy Mountain,10,3 September 2012,A movie which deals with a lot of thing and never been detached.,"Well. what can I say about this movie? Good is not enough.Bizarre, weird, surreal, anti religious, anti capitalistic, anti communist, anti materialistic, surreal, sick, cute, sarcastic. Every single shot means a lot. This movie rules. This is so special. And most of all, it sings the song of humanity and hope and love. If you like to watch some bizarre images, okay go on, you will not be able to get the movie, but you will like that for sure. If you want to understand this movie, and give this movie a proper view you will be amused with so many surreal and symbolic shots. You will get so many messages. The good thing is, there is enough space for you to think these things in your own way. I can differ with you about some things, but there is no absolute theory. This is the beauty of viewing multiplicity of this movie. The movie Starts with a Christ like man with a creep stranger. The journey starts. And revolve around the world and universe in search of immorality. In this journey, they collect people from different planets. The world is like a glass, and through their eyes, everything is so naked. What a sarcastic view! At the end, did they were able to get what they wanted? Actually, the question is id they need hat they want? The holy mountain is a mind provoking movie. Strongly recommended for every mature people."
62,The Holy Mountain,9,27 June 2012,What did I just watch?,"My entire perception of reality and what the medium of cinema means has changed since watching Alejandro Jodorowsky's sacrilegious mind trip The Holy Mountain. It's a bizarre avant-garde film that uses strange and sacrilegious imagery to evoke reactions of fear, disgust, wonder, and mysticism in its viewers. The film begins with a Christ like figure wandering around a destitute city. He then finds his way to an alchemist who forms a band of men and women who will seek immortality and utmost holiness from the Gods who supposedly live atop the Holy Mountain. It's an intense audio visual experience that absolutely blew me a way.While watching The Holy Mountain I had no idea what was going on and trying to decipher all the images in the film is a near impossible challenge. But what I did know is that I was watching a masterpiece. I could feel it in the grandiose way the film was presented and the profound subject matter at hand. One set after another absolutely floored me in it's innovative design unlike anything I've ever seen before. Jodorowsky's use of color is profound and the simple yet ingenious things he does with the camera are beautifully spectacular.The Holy Mountain is a beautiful film and a disturbing film at the same time. It has a thick air of mysticism about it that strikes wonder and confusion into the viewer like a knife. If you sit back and allow The Holy Mountain to take you at its will it will invoke intense emotional reactions in you, but you won't even understand why. The very end of the film takes an incredibly bizarre and unforeseen turn that I never could have expected. It ends so abruptly and when the credits began to role I found myself getting a little misty, and I had no idea why. This is a profound film that does unexpected things to the viewer. Watch at your own risk because The Holy Mountain just might change your life"
63,The Holy Mountain,10,4 April 2012,"Look beyond Jowdorosky's craziness, and comprehend his intellect.","I had watched ""The Holy mountain"" a few years back and I've forgotten why and how I came across this film, for the ""why"" i meant, ""The Holy Mountain"" was made 20 years before I was born, and there, really wasn't any reason for me to watch it except for my boredom. But I am glad to have watched it, for it exposed me to the insight of art, ""The Holy Mountain"" became a definition of ""Art"" for me, and besides being ""the"" definition of ""art"" for me; ""The Holy Mountain"" had me questioning on the modern perception of ""sanity"", I used to have, and in fact many people still defines ""insanity"" if the action a person action or the thinking that person has, that does not relate to us or compromise with society, as an act of ""insanity""; To think of it , even in retrospect , people have been defining ""insanity"", aforementioned. The definition of ""sanity"" should refer to a rationality of an individual; After watching ""The Holy Mountain"", I find the conclusion to the story, rational; The journey until the conclusion, surreal. The film and its imagery still lingers on my mind on a regular basis. You will need some exposure to Christianity in order to understand the surface of the story, and anything beyond that, is up to your interpretation - my summary will consists of minor spoilers and some of my own interpretation; For the first 20mins , there is no dialogue, Jowdorosky bring us to a tour, a tour showcasing human's ""insanity"". During the tour, a scene with soldiers and man dancing in each other arm, struck me with a thought, is ""insanity"" conditional? Is it okay for people to be irrational for the sake of finding peace and sanity amidst chaos and insanity? After the tour , the main character(The Thief) a Christ-like figure, ventures into the surreal realm of the Alchemist. The Thief deemed the Alchemist as an adversary and attacks him, The Alchemist exhibits his powers and remove an alien substance that was seemingly the cause of The Thief's violent nature; The Alchemist then says to The Thief: ""Do you want gold?"" and The Thief replied ""Yes"", The Alchemist then made The Thief defecate into a container - Yes , you will watch him literally shitting, naked.The Alchemist then had The Thief go through a hellish process, sweat and tears are flowing out from The Thief, in order to transform the excrement into gold, an idiom for ""working"", maybe? and he said to the Thief: ""You are excrement. You can change yourself into gold."" . The quote made sense to me, humans sort of is, an excrement and we're working hard to turn into something worthy. The Thief is then introduced to 7 powerful humans who will accompany The Thief on his journey, and each of their introduction conveys an emphasised sin, personifying Christianity 7 deadly sins. The Thief, The Alchemist and the 7 sins then embarks on their journey to The Holy Mountain to obtain immortality,and will they attain immortality? Not spoiling it for you. I believe that Jowdorosky's conclusion to the film, is an important underlying message, but revealing that message will spoil the essence of the film, I'm not spoiling it, so watch it yourself!I recommend this film to people who likes surreal imagery, because every frame is wallpaper worthy; people who have an open sense of humor, because religion mockery is always funny; and lastly, people who are bored out of their mind."
64,The Holy Mountain,,12 January 2011,A Feast for the Eyes {Alexandro Jodorowsky},"I first saw this movie in Paris on release in 1973. I had experienced Jodorowsky's oeuvre already as I had seen El Topo a few times and adored that movie. This prepared me for The Holy Mountain as I had become oriented to the meandering tempo of his story-telling techniques. I saw him as a mystical relative of Carlos Casteneda with a distinct flavour of Bunuel's Simon of the Desert , Exterminating Angel, etc. I saw this movie again tonight {37 years on} and I was also aware of the influence of Pasolini and Fellini. Although movies are always considered to be collaborative affairs - in Jodorowsky's case so much of the production has his imprint - costume, choreography, camera, dialogue, acting that he is extreme from the point of view of the ""auteur theory"",The tableaux, the processions, the Day of the Dead played out in every conceivable way. The care which was given to the symbolization of the saturating imagery, - I can only say that its all very Mexican. What makes this film special is the mastery of fantasy, that the ARTIST/pataphysician Jodorowsky offers his audience , in phantasmagoric detail, that is presented always from the spiritual point of view. It is a conceit, and there is no plot - only an attempt at revealing ""another way of seeing"". If this is what you desire then this movie has a HUGE amount to offer This movie is for those that value an intelligent sacrament to the Power of Life . Seek it out . It will certainly challenge your imagination. As Jimi Hendrix expressed it ""Are you experienced?"" -- {Posted 19 January 2011} - The middle section of the movie {the zodiacal tour of the governing Planets and their all-pervading influence}. This section departs from Jodorowsky's usual presentation as it has narrative flow. One feels the influence of Bunuel's Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie in a parodic exaggeration which could easily be termed the Indiscreet Charm of the Bourgeosie. This is the astrological Morality Procession from which the Magus sources 7 disciples {each corresponding to another Planet}. The two best known {to the modern mind, at least} Venus and Mars are both fleshed out and thought out in the most thorough manner. Venus, portrayed in a Kabbalistic palace, the rooms beautifully laid out, richly furnished, colored in strong primaries. Basically, the featured Don Juan character exploits the woman workers, who all crave sexual contact and have erotic yearnings towards him {in a surreal joke, if they are successful, they are promoted to secretaries}. There is also the falseness of cosmeticized appearance and the disguise of Death with the use of Dadaistic machinery - aka.The Cult of Beauty. Mars features an amazonian beauty who in contradistinction to Venus has crowds of male secretaries and is constantly manufacturing armaments and engineering conflicts {Dick Cheney-style} in order to make more money {the weapons are presented in a humorously surreal way}. Jupiter, the pre-eminent Planet is portrayed as a decadent, materialist, who runs an art factory and drives a stretch-limo, where he has sex constantly, while his workers make art with their bare buttocks, covered in paint, and then stamped onto paper, - Andy Warhol style.The interesting sex-aid type sculptures that are exhibited in Jupiter's gallery have a kinetic interactive appeal that showcases Jodorowskys plastic talents. Saturn, the dark influence, has the exploitation of children, at first shown innocently cavorting in circus setting, - this Planets influence is in the corruption of the child with toys of war and brainwashing techniques ""Know Thine Enemy"". Uranus, here in a welter of imagery, the capitalist vision is in the economy of numbers - if you kill enough people , there is less pressure on the economy and so more for the plutocrats to appropriate. It has an interesting scene with a jersey clad python. Neptune, features the Chief of Police, riots, demonstrations, mutilations, castrations, cruelty, barbarism in a fascistic orgy of totalitarian excess. Pluto, is illustrated as a modern building with spiral stairways and children in Mickey Mouse ears, - there is the proposal that the poor should not be offered homes with comforts but instead, shelters with no comforts and that no resources other than the most basic should be wasted on them. These then become the 7 reprobates that the Shaman leads to the Holy Mountain of redemption and/or salvation. This movie is a slow accretion of layer upon layer of thought provoking imagery. The audience is asked to contribute their intellect in a polemic of visionary ideals."
65,The Holy Mountain,,12 April 2000,Psychedelic with a twist,"Probably the strangest movie I've ever seen. The first 30 minutes are extraordinary in their images, use of symbols and archetypes. It's sometimes difficult to know what the hell is going on, and what the hell Jodorowsky is trying to tell us. But hang on! All will be explained near the end of the film. The final twist makes The Sixth Sense ea. seem like beyond predictable."
66,The Holy Mountain,,2 November 1998,Destruction of the mind and all that resembles it.,"Few films I've experienced manage to be as surrealistic and frightening as the first 30 minutes of _The Holy Mountain_.  We follow a Christ-like figure through parades of flayed and crucified lambs, frogs and lizards dressed as priests and conquistadors trampling a model Maya (?) city, a hall full of life-size plaster replicas of the main character (who remains nameless, I believe); eventually he is pulled from this chaos by a guru-figure, played by Jodorowsky himself.After much ado, a group of sorts is assembled for a quest; this is where the plot starts to bog down the beautifully surrealistic moments of the opening. There is a point to the plot and a few surprising twists, all informed by Jodorowsky's unusual viewpoints and eclectic bits of random religious, philosophical and occult traditions._The Holy Mountain_ pushes past the concept of avant-garde into the realms of the psychedelic, the transfigurative.  It's a movie so powerful, so strange that it STILL hasn't been released in the United States on video (look for import laserdiscs from Japan - it's worth it)."
67,The Holy Mountain,1,20 April 2011,The Holy Mountain (1973),"""If you watch this sh*t, we'll show you tities"", this movie seems to say.This is the kind of movie only a sex-crazed teenager would watch, if he had no internet connection. It goes something like this. Crap. Crap. Utter crap. Tities! Crap. Crap. Boring crap. Tities! Crap. Crap. Despicable crap. Tities!There is no plot, there is no story, there is only a relentless deluge of disgusting images, designed to provoke strong reactions (or at least that's what the director thought, I'm sure). I only watched for 5 minutes or so. Then I realized I've seen this kind of crap before and it wasn't worth it.Whatever you do, avoid this movie. At any cost. If a friend comes to you and says: ""Hey, I found this great movie, let's watch it""... drop everything you're doing and get out of the house. Get out. Leave!The Holy Mountain. If the producers refused to make this crap I would have given them a medal. But as it is... I give them a 0 (zero)."
68,The Holy Mountain,10,16 December 2008,"Jodorowsky's Most Bizarre, Profound And Ingenious Masterpiece - Unlike Anything You Have Ever Seen!","Alejandro Jodorowsky is, without any doubt, one of the most unique and unconventional filmmakers of all-time. As far as I am concerned, Jodorowsky is also one of the most brilliant filmmakers of all-time. Jodorowsky's bizarre and ingenious cinema is simply without comparison, as this Chilean master of the surreal never allowed himself to be narrowed down by Genre, or any conventional rules of film-making. Whether one likes it or not, it is undeniable that Jodorowsky's cinema is exceptional - and for a fan of exceptional cinema, films like ""The Holy Mountain"" are the most exceptional experience possible. I've personally been a great Jodorowsky fan ever since seeing ""El Topo"" (1970) and ""Santa Sangre"" (1989), both of which are masterpieces and instant personal favorites that I rated at a well-deserved 10/10. This film, however, impressed me even more than the two aforementioned films. ""The Holy Mountain"" of 1973 is Jodorowsky's most surreal and most brilliant masterpiece, and no other film I've seen (with the exception of Jodorowsky's other work) could possibly compare to it. The film is bizarre beyond comparison, and yet, even though one might never completely understand what it all means, it is ingeniously to the point in many aspects. The mere try to give a plot synopsis would be pointless, as ""The Holy Mountain"" is a film that cannot be described merely in words - ""The Holy Mountain"" is a film that has to be seen, or, more precisely, that has to be experienced, in order even to have the slightest idea what it is about.The film begins with the incredibly surreal and yet profoundly impressive scenes in which a Christ-like figure encounters grotesque situations and bizarre religious imagery... This is only a very vague description of the beginning of ""The Holy Mountain"", but describing it adequately simply isn't possible - and if it was, it would not be desirable to do so, as this film is a unique work of art which all that are even slightly interested in cinema MUST experience for themselves. Beatles legend John Lennon was reportedly so impressed by ""El Topo"", that he convinced manager Allen Klein to finance this film. The obvious higher budget allowed Jodorowsky to build up incredible settings for ""The Holy Mountain"". Jodororowsky's masterpiece is overwhelming in all aspects imaginable - be it the brilliantly grotesque imagery, the ingeniously bizarre plot that is impossible to properly describe, or the countless sequences and subplots in which the film spoofs all kinds if institutions such as governments, the church, or modern artistic pretentiousness alike. The film sarcastically points out the corruption, hypocrisy and brutality of the world in a most brilliant manner that is both shocking and ironic to a point that is sometimes hilarious. All that is presented in a unique, purely Jodorowsky-esquire atmosphere, accompanied by an insanely brilliant score. Jodorowsky never used famous actors in his films (except for ""The Raibow Thief"" which I haven't seen), in fact many of the actors in his films never participated anywhere else, but it is obvious that all those involved were absolutely committed to Jodorowsky and the brilliance of his work. Jodorowsky himself, once again, stars in the film, this time as 'The Alchemist', a role which, once again, cannot properly be described in words. Jodorowsky's trademark casting of people with handicaps and deformities in supporting roles (which was also the case in ""El Topo"" and ""Santa Sangre"") sometimes reminds me of Tod Browning's 1932 masterpiece ""Freaks"", and, as it is the case in Browning's milestone, it can never possibly be misinterpret end as voyeurism. On the contrary, these people are shown in an incomparably more positive light than most of the others, and then again, it is hard to determine whether or not anyone in the film is really meant to appear as 'positive'. On could possibly go on puzzling about what the film is supposed to mean, and never come to a conclusion, even after watching it ten times and philosophizing about it after each viewing. It is, however, without any doubt that this is an absolute must-see for every lover of film. The first twenty minutes alone are among the most unforgettable cinematic experiences one can have, and there is a lot more to come. My review of ""The Holy Mountain"" may not even vaguely point out what an overwhelming experience this is, but, if it encourages anyone to see the film, I will be more than satisfied. In short: ""The Holy Mountain"" is Jodorowsky's most brilliant film and one of the greatest cinematic experiences one can have. 10 out of 10, and if it was possible, I'd even reward it with a higher rating!"
69,The Holy Mountain,10,26 August 2008,Better than a trip to the MET Art Museum,"If you want to see a film with THE MOST AMAZING SETS constructed, see THE HOLY MOUNTAIN. The music is very atmospheric, and the accompanying imagery is so mind-bogglingly cool that I simply cannot describe it here. It cheapens it. Nude women, men, human excrement, real dead animals, who cares if you are offended, you shouldn't have time to be offended, what with all the gorgeous film-making going on here. Poor film-making offends me, not non-sexual nudity. Should you have the common sense to see this, you will be greatly rewarded. I suppose you should already enjoy movies like this, you know, good movies like 2001, The Wild Bunch, and Fitzcarraldo. The camera angles, the set designs, everything just reeks of GENIUS DIRECTOR, sort of in the vein of Stanley Kubrick (if he was alive and living in the movie Westworld)or a Bizzaro-World-Wes Anderson (the amazing attention to detail on the set designs). If you find yourself rewinding scenes in films not to check the subtitle on the dialogue or to zoom in on some cute girl but instead to go, ""Whoa, look at that (set design, outdoor panorama, etc)!!"" then this film is for you."
70,The Holy Mountain,10,4 September 2005,One of a Kind,"There's no other film like this. It is in a league of its own, standing out even apart from Jodorowsky's other films. It is a masterpiece. Many people may not be able to sit through this, since it has a rather abstract and philosophical narrative structure, and very little dialogue. However, I think everybody should see it. It has some very interesting and important things to say about religion and society. Not only that, but it is without a doubt the most visually stunning film I've ever seen. There are so many uniquely beautiful and thought-provoking images in this film--enough to fill a book. I'd buy that book, actually, if it existed. It's really quite a shame that there isn't a restored version of this film available on DVD. This should be required viewing for anyone interested in religion, film or art in general."
71,The Holy Mountain,10,26 July 2009,One of the most interesting movies ever,"This is perhaps one of my most favorite movies ever because before I ever watched this movie I briefly studied religion (my favorite being Hinduism and Buddhism) and as I watched the movie I find some of the most essential religious themes that corresponds with eastern philosophy (and religion) and Judeo-Christian religion. This film is perhaps the most profound film I'd watched, however I find that many would be confused and thus misunderstand the intention and message of the film. The film, I must emphasize, is not a purely arbitrary that results from bad acid trip. There have been moments in the film inspired by psychedelic drugs but this inspiration was used occasionally only as the means to portray and convey the a form of mystical aesthetic. The movie simply did not happen because of indulgent drug use, it was carefully and creatively written and filmed by Alejandro Jodorowsky who happens to be an expert (or at least well learned) in comparative religion and practiced Zen Buddhism and other esoteric practices.And I have to emphasize Alejandro Jodorowsky is not one of those hippies who tries to inspire the hippy movement, that is not his intention and style. Although Alejandro Jodorowsky can easily be labeled as a hippy because of his fascination with drugs, variety of religions, and liberalism Alejandro Jodorowsky did not necessarily make the film to carry out the political agenda that most hippies might have in common with him. Alejandro Jodorowsky's movie is emphasizing through the brief protagonist of the thief of a human person ""thrown"" into the absurd and surreal reality in which his existence is victimized by capitalism, religion, and society. Through out the whole movie the protagonist meets the alchemist and then strives for immortality among all other aspirants. Each of these aspirants reflect the problems of modernity, globalization, and basic human problems. They all strive for immortality in the cost of extreme asceticism to transcend their instinctual and mortal drive. Through out the movie they go through a psychological and spiritual journey of mortification and selflessness. However through their journey they slowly learn to make a distinction between illusion and reality, and in the end when they reached their destination they find themselves humorously disillusioned. There really was no immortality, it was simply an idea they had to strive for. This realization is inspired by zen Buddhism and Hinduism, when the person makes a journey he or she strives for enlightenment, salvation, moksha, or a certain ideal spiritual goal. But once they reach there they find that there really is no ""Enlightenment"", ""Salvation"", ""Moksha"" or any spiritual goal. This emphasizes the journey, but not only does it emphasize the journey but it emphasizes self-realization that there is no attainment but simply knowing who one is. The ""Holy Mountain"" and ""Immortality"" likewise are spiritual goals that the nine mortals tried to strive for but in the end they realize that there is no ""immortality"" to begin with, the real purpose of the journey is to help them find reality not immortality. It is to help them know who they are. The Buddhist make a similar illustration in which the journey men takes a raft from his village through a river bank to reach his destination. But when he reached his destination and looks back, he doesn't see the destination but the whole reality which he went through. He no longer sees his village, his destination, his river banks, and his raft, he sees the big picture that pales his experience in comparison. For me the theme of the film makes it very precious and profound to watch, and it certainly has proved itself unique and different from traditional Hollywood movies. Despite the fact that symbols and events have ambiguous messages this is simply because most of us are not fully well learned in religious symbols, but regardless of that fact I enjoyed the movie."
72,The Holy Mountain,10,3 May 2006,A lost classic!,"This was better than anything that came out that decade.Subversion, religion, terror, art...name it, it was here.Jodorowsky made great-looking films. Usually, they were hard to follow. But they were so beautifully shot, it was hard to turn away. Holy Mountain is an exception. The payoff was priceless. The characters were developed nicely. And his trademark imagery was as good as ever.I do wonder why most of his films feature firing squad executions of civilians though.And the use of animals (or fake animal corpses, at least I hope they were fake) might not go down too well among the squeamish.Jodorowski never made a bad film. THIS was his best. That says plenty."
73,The Holy Mountain,6,7 August 2010,Good Lord,"Like David Lynch's Lost Highway, The Holy Mountain is a film I'd be liable to recommend to a species of intelligence superior to man. This film is almost unclassifiable by human standards, except to call it a surrealist film, which is what we label anything that intentionally doesn't make sense. The film has a few neat sequences here and there, including a cute ending (even though it is a rushed one). What bothers me most about The Holy Mountain is that frankly it is in very bad taste. Its content is irreverent, and vulgar, and whatever the film is trying to say doesn't come out very well.The middle section I think is the best part. A number of individual sequences experimenting with allegory and art direction bode much better than the film as an entire hundred minute story. Art critics will probably look at The Holy Mountain, and be reminded of Hieronymous Bosh's Garden of Earthly Delights. Among other things both feature copious amounts of over saturated, unnatural colors and frontal nudity. The Holy Mountain can be plushy while at the same time kind of gross. The end result is a mildly interesting art movie, sometimes nice to look at, and yet it's also kind of repulsive, and not very smart. Might be of interest to art fans."
74,The Holy Mountain,9,24 March 2008,A Spiritual Journey Into the Absurd,"""The Holy Mountain"" is an unusual tale, deep in philosophical symbolism and imagery. On the surface, it tells the tale of a thief who enters the tower of an alchemist and is taught that he can turn his worthless life into one more meaningful. But then we get the symbolism: religious imagery, Tarot-inspired imagery and other oddities.There is a scene early on where the lead character, the thief, is thought to look like Jesus. His unconscious body was used by local merchants (including a cross-dressing nun) to make Christ statues. He is also followed by a teenage prostitute and a chimpanzee... and another part where he ""eats the body of Christ"" by devouring one of the statues. Just to give you a sense of the possible sacrilegious nature.We also have toads and chameleons dressed as Spanish conquistadors, a scene where the alchemist turns excrement to gold (the most blatant metaphor in the film), a gun made from a menorah, and a one-handed, one-footed dwarf. And this is just the beginning.Those who don't like excessive nudity should avoid the movie. There is an endless supply of male and female full frontal nudity, and a close-up of man's nether region being washed. Apparently, this movie was supposed to star George Harrison but he declines because of the nudity and specifically the washing scene. Harrison, along with John Lennon, largely funded this project (which was produced by Allan Klein).How to describe this film? Well, I'd say it may be the greatest film ever made if you like cult films. It's sort of like Danny Elfman's ""The Forbidden Zone"" meets Salvador Dali meets the Beatles meets a snuff film. If that sounds inviting, you need to check this out. If that scares you, run away fast."
75,The Holy Mountain,,9 November 2003,Beware of excessively deep surreality,"I consider myself a lover of strange, hard to understand movies. And I consider myself a fan of Jodorowsky's graphical creations. But this Jodorowsky's hard to understand movie has brutally disappointed me. Despite his known stances about art (how it should reach the masses and such), this movie needs an instruction manual to be understood, and trust me it would be very heavy. Certainly he didn't want to make a movie like The Seventh Seal, but there are points so extreme they aren't good anymore. This movie makes Mulholland Dr. look as Esopo's fables.The movie behaves almost visually, there is scarce dialogue which doesn't really add much to the extreme symbolic imaginery, often so twisted that I doubt the author was sure of what he wanted to say with it, if he wanted to say something specific, which I really doubt too. It's understandable that movies contain disgusting scenes, but The Holy Mountain has meaningless grossity, there's no real point in being gross if no one is going to understand why. I don't say that the movie has no meaning - I just want to remark that it's very hard, complex and difficult to understand due to the high amount of unintelligible symbols heavily used all around. And be warned - when you see a scene which has some sense and you think you are starting to get the idea, next scene will make you scream `but now where does that come from?'The argumental line of the movie, and certain scenes/symbols directly attached to it aren't so bad, they make sense. But overloaded by excessive burden, unneeded barroquery, it makes it fade away. Maybe a bit more polishment would have made this movie much better. The Holy Mountain looks like The Shrunken Hill.Having been studying lately the content and meaning of movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey, and in its day movies with dark, mysterious plots as Akira, I don't think I'm stupid to not understand the movie. I even like some of the things, since I like weird stuff and digging into my mind's reaction to the messages shot at it. But to me it looks just as a bunch of good ideas for scenes, with meaningful messages for the viewer, thrown all together without much thought and forming a shapeless sinking ship which fails to commit its purpose. Titanic? Probably.And what really makes me dislike this movie the most, is that in the end it's just a pretentious surrealistic voyage which ends nowhere. Is it all about wrapping anything into shiny paper? That will not make the content any better, instead it will make it look more meaningless. Excessive fireworks without any noise, and worse: chaotic. The well looks deep, but certainly it's dry. And following the movie's surrealistic line, I'll finish the lowdown with: Obese from the greedy meal, the boy starved and died. If you understood that sentence, you will know why I didn't like the movie, and why you will not like if you watch it.***This paragraph contains a small spoiler*** The end almost made me want to kill myself! Ok the message is very good: `there's nothing better than the real thing'. But then it rendered totally meaningless the characters' trip in search for immortality. So in the end, all the movie wanted to say was corrupted by the void morality of the final thought.It hits very low in my list, I'd give it 3 out of 10. Only watchable if you're really into very weird stuff. I'd recommend it to those, but no one else. I'm sure people is able to like this movie, but not me."
76,The Holy Mountain,,22 September 2003,A stream of consciousness movie,"The Holy Mountain is best described as a stream of consciousness--like a really weird dream.  It's the kind of movie that keeps you watching just to see what happens.  You never know where it's going next.  Some parts are certainly better than others, but every scene has something memorable about it.  Jodorowsky is part Luis Bunuel (An Andolousian Dog, Viridiana), part Fellini (La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, Amarcord), and part David Lynch (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet).  If you enjoy those three directors, you'll probably find this one worth your while.  But if strange, off-beat art films leave you cold, don't bother with it."
77,The Holy Mountain,9,11 November 1998,ooooooo...,It's very simple:  this film is one of the oddest and greatest films you will ever see!!  Not for everyone (THANK GOD) but an experience you will never forget...see it uncut!!
78,The Holy Mountain,10,28 November 2010,Instilled in me a deeper love and higher perspective for religion and mysticism,"For those of you seeking to cite this film an example anti-religion/morality, I'd like to say that you are very much mistaken.The Holy Mountain is as Open Minded and Tolerant as it is Ambitious. Jodorowsky demonstrates throughout the film a reverence for the humble seeker of truth. Even several (though not all) of the protagonists are furthered in their quest by the acceptance and study of religion.There are several scenes where priests, fanatics and pretentious philosophers antagonize the protagonist from walking the path of enlightenment, but they are illustrated as being a wolf in sheep's clothing and not representative as religion as a whole.To me, the infamous anti-climactic ending is an illustration on how there is no end to wisdom and enlightenment. We should not assume that through past experiences we are remiss of seeking further knowledge. In that way, you could possibly make this movie fit into your anti-religion agenda in that; complacency in religion-alone closes your mind off to truth as a whole."
79,The Holy Mountain,9,4 May 2009,What to say about this movie...,"I saw this movie years ago and it is without a doubt, one of the weirdest things I have ever watched (besides every other Alejandro Jodorowsky movie, especially Santa Sangre). The director decided to include many eastern religious symbols into the movie to try and make it more meaningful, but the symbols don't really make sense in the way they are portrayed, and it seems like the director just read the cliff notes of Hindu and Buddhist religions and tried to portray them for pedantic means (the symbolic metaphors of western religion are extremely obvious though). The movie, barring a few religious mix ups, is still extremely good, and I gave it a nine out of ten stars for a good reason. The imagery and characters, are whimsical, sometimes seeming like they are straight out of a dream. Unfortuneatly this dream doesn't take into account that animal cruelty is somewhat of a taboo these days, and several scenes are almost unwatchable because of this. Still the movie is great, and should be enjoyed, preferably wasted and with friends that have enough guts to sit through it with you. The ending is amazing and awe inspiring, so watch the whole thing from beginning to end without ruining it for yourself. You'll be glad you did."
80,The Holy Mountain,9,23 April 2008,You can change yourself into gold.,"How does one describe this film? How does one describe any film by Jodorowsky? Is there any explanation that will give a clue to the workings of his mind? Any attempt to interpret Jodorowsky's thoughts and ideas would be an exercise in futility. he uses symbolism, mostly religious, to make a point, but what point is he making? He certainly has no hesitation to use the human body as a statement, as a canvas, as a message, as...I don't know.The use of color in the sets and the costuming was spectacular. The costumes (when people wore clothing) were exquisite. The set pieces were mind boggling.Any attempt to explain this film would prove futile. It is not meant to be explained, but to be experienced, enjoyed, and, maybe, to create a sense of wonderment, awe, and, yes, freedom. Your favorite mind-altering substance would certainly enhance the experience."
81,The Holy Mountain,10,4 August 2007,"Timeless, Visually Stunning","I consumed morning glory seeds, prior to enjoying this film. It was probably the single most enjoyable movie experience I have ever had in my life, and I'm not just talking about the psychedelic experience. Simply put, this film is OVERFLOWING with amazing images and visualizations. Though this film is underground and seems a generally well-kept secret, it is a one-of-a-kind treasure.This film is a timeless gift, meant to be cherished. I first watched El Topo, which was also amazing. However, I must say that this one was quite a bit more rich, in a visual sense. I have yet to see Fando y Lis, though I will soon, as I am currently in the process of ordering the box set, which includes all three films, in addition to two soundtrack discs. Do yourself a favor and check out The Holy Mountain, as it is absolutely incredible!!"
82,The Holy Mountain,,24 July 2007,"It's a Less Personalized, but I Personally Feel That it is a Most Excellent Film.","***1/2 out of ****After Jodrowsky made EL TOPO, he would get better financing, more creative and artistic freedom to depict his vision, and the very handy use of more actors, set pieces, and music. It's not that EL TOPO didn't lack any of these things, but being able to make a more dynamic movie with more money kind of takes away from the ability to create things from the simplest sources, which is one of the things he did best with EL TOPO. Because he has all these great benefits and stuff, it means that his film will be less personalized. This basically means that it doesn't feel the same watching this movie as it did with EL TOPO.Aside from that flaw, this is a great film. It's a perfectly beautiful, unique, and intelligent film overall. It is really a joy to watch. If you haven't seen EL TOPO, it probably won't be a good idea to check this one out yet. If you did see EL TOPO and didn't like it because you thought it was too weird or messed up, avoid this film like the plague. Trust me, to you this will be far weirder. But for those people who liked EL TOPO and liked or appreciated it's weirdness, you will most likely like the film. This is really probably for people who appreciate the film making talents of Alejandro Jodrowsky. If you hated EL TOPO, or SANTA SANGRE, or FANDO Y LIS, chances are that you will loath this film.The plot, like EL TOPO, is impossible to describe without making it sound worse than it actually is. BUT, Unlike EL TOPO, this can actually be classified in a genre. Sure, it has several elements of different genres, but this film can actually be officially classified as a BIBLICAL SATIRE. Alejandro Jodrowsky has been the victim of religious intolerance before, and this film, THE HOLY MOUNTAIN, can be classified as his great revenge. In this film he pokes fun at different religious virtues and traditions as if it weren't such a powerful force behind worldly problems as celebrates and basks in what he feels is a funny and ridiculous subjective cult. He blows out of proportion the different religious practices and procedures by stating plainly with this film that it is all a joke and that people need to stop taking it seriously and enjoy life. You get this sense right from the beginning, in which Jesus Christ wakes up on the cross covered with bugs, climbs down, scares off a group of children that gather around him, and then smokes marijuana with a black midget with no hands or feet. It's really quite ridiculous.This film is definitely more elaborate than EL TOPO, considering it's massive set pieces. There are tons of chambers, electronic cityscapes, factories, forests, streets, and stages that are displayed in the film, and they are rich and full of color, life, people, and wonder. The attention to detail can occasionally be slightly overwhelming, However, i really quite enjoyed seeing this film. Considering that this is a lost classic that was just recently re-released, it's worth getting your hands on if you are fans of EL TOPO. But beware, this is considered to be surreal and chaotic cinema. These are films that have an extreme driving force behind all of the madness. Usually everything is personified. The directors of these film have been known to make personal choices in the making of these films by composing the music, dubbing all the voices themselves, editing and mixing the sound all by them selves, and even acting in them and being main characters. Alejandro Jodrowski and his films can be compared to in the likes of such directors as David Lynch(ERASERHEAD, MULLHOLLAND DR.), Peter Greenaway( THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, AND HER LOVER, PROSPERO'S BOOKS) and Luis Bunuel(BELLE DE JOUR, UN CHIEN ANDALOU). Alejandro Jodrowsky is considered to be one of the pioneers on personal and chaotic film making. The earliest example of this kind of film making is with Tod Browning's FREAKS(1932), and the latest example of this, in actuality, is with that annoying Tom Green dude with his debut film, FREDDY GOT FINGERED(2001), which i don't want to totally dismiss since i know a lot of people who like that movie. I don't want to throw rocks at anybody, so i won't criticize, although even i feel that just mentioning it in this review is giving it too much credit. Anyway, i guess what I'm trying to say is that these aren't the kind of films that can be considered typical or normal by anybody really. This is a very different type of film making, and i can only recommend it to people who are cinematically adventurous. I know that i like this film a lot and i am aware that i am praising it, but i hate the idea of the wrong person seeing this film. This is I can praise it but i do not recommend it to everybody. Having said that, this is a great film.Contains extreme violence and gore, strong sexual content and nudity, and drug use."
83,The Holy Mountain,10,2 July 2007,just watch it. . . decide for yourself,"One of the all time greatest films that I have ever seen.It was an amazing journey that I will take again and again. . .better than an acid trip. . . mostly because the trip is shorter, and I have often found myself in the middle of an acid trip wishing for it to end so I can do something more productive. . .then Voila! Holy Mountain on DVD. . .awesome. Never a dull moment. . . I want to make love to it. Is that illegal? If you are pontificating the pros and cons of whether you should spend the time to watch this flick or pass over it for something ""safer"". . . stop thinking! Just watch it. There are some over the top moments, but not as bad as some things that I've watched. . . It was definitely entertaining and funny and . . .and . . . just watch it already!"
84,The Holy Mountain,8,20 June 2007,Jodorowsky never lets you down,"What a difficult movie to write about! Always enjoyable with some sensational imagery, this is amusing, thought provoking, cynical and heart-warming (in the best possible way). It is possible that, as I did, it might be helpful to see the wonderful documentary, 'La Constellation Jodorowsky' (1994), before seeing this as it could otherwise appear a little naïve or pretentious. It is, of course, a film very much of its time so they is much nudity and talk of searching for the answer to the universe by sniffing flowers, but don't be misled - Jodorowsky never lets you down. It seemed just a little overlong but I think that was because I originally thought this was all about the ascent of a mountain and as we go through depictions of each various planetary influences, I began to think it would be more protracted than it was. Absolutely marvellous and an essential view."
85,The Holy Mountain,10,13 December 2006,A Psychedelic Experience.,"Jodorowsky is the top alchemist and brujo extraordinaire.This is an event of non-linear proportions. Visually traumatic and disturbing THE HOLY MOUNTAIN works its magic on the viewer like a good dose of magic mushrooms or acid ! Shamanistic symbolism abounds,reference to the esoteric enneagram system is made.An ancient occult system used by the Sufis. Alchemical process is one of the major themes in all Jodorowsky's movies,never so much as in THE HOLY MOUNTAIN. The cast of extras are always interesting in Jodorowsky's films,he out-fellinis Fellini.Casting cripples,amputees and weird fringe characters from the locales of Mexico. So many references to psychotropic compounds throughout this magik flick. Whatever technique Alexandro Jodorowsky uses to mesmerize and deeply affect his audience it is certainly effective. Beautiful and violent brimming with profundity."
86,The Holy Mountain,8,28 March 2006,...Wow...,"I must admit, Holy Mountain is one of the most bizarre films ever created. It took me several times to watch the movie to finally make it all the way through. This movie is such a shock to the senses and so unsettling it can be very hard to take it all in one sitting. I am not sure where the direction of the movie was going as the movie seems to be done in three different parts. The first part introducing this Jesus like character and a few of his strange exploits. After he climbs this tower (which at the time I thought it was the tower of Babel) he meets this sorcerer of some sort and then the movie shifts to something completely different. The second part is showing all these different people from different planets who seem to have extraordinary powers. The movie goes on like that for a while and then part three seems to kick in where apparently these people want to climb ""The Holy Mountain"" to become Gods. Now, I am not sure if that really helps to explain the movie, you really just need to see it for yourself and make the best sense out of it. But, like it or not, you will still walk away from this movie saying ...wow."
87,The Holy Mountain,10,25 August 2005,The most impressive movie from Jodorowsky (in an spiritual way),"I have seen this movie like 6 times, and each time I think Jodorowsky is really an artist. Just watch it and say. But it will be better if you read some of his books as: ""La danza de la realidad"" or ""El maestro y las magas"", edited this past years. This way you will understand better the universe this guy is moving in. There is a way of watching this,m without prejudices end trying to understand what is he wanting to say. There are scenes completely methaforics but with a clear interpretation. And the end is one of the bests in cinema history (in my opinion), it's something that has been used by some other people, but it has never been used with a complete reason. For the first time a deus ex machina has a real sense. What does this movie talk about? the way of living with a clear objectivity, ergo happy. Don't miss his other films, specially ""El topo""."
88,The Holy Mountain,,8 May 2004,Jesus in a g-string--what a flick!,"This movie has:**costumed frogs in battle **a guy pulling out his glass eye and giving it to a little girl **lots of nudity, often in close-up **lots of blood and yucky sound f/x **brunette fem-bots **skinned lambs on crosses **a mutant midget **Jesus running around in a g-string, screaming at statues of himself and eating his own face **a chimpanzeeAnd that's just the first half hour! I could care less what it all means (it's about a deranged fimmaker making a cool bizarro flick imho), this movie is fun. Mostly. Unfortunately, it was filmed in reverse--it starts with the exciting climax and works towards a boring, quiet ending. It's also long. And it's hard to find a decent copy. It's also really gross in many parts; I'd rather NOT know where gold comes from, thank you...This reminded me of ""Liztomania"" by Ken Russell, if you're in the mood it's a great ""trip,"" if not, it'll give you a major head-ache. It's equal parts Russell/Fellini/Bunuel and John Waters. Santa Sangre was more coherent and good prints are easy to find, but neither it nor El Topo are as spectacular or goofy as this journey into the excessive imagination of a truly unhinged director. I'm glad movies like this exist, even if only in bad prints."
89,The Holy Mountain,9,1 March 2016,Amazingly astonishing visuals... But kinda sickening,"The impression this movie made on me was like how I feel about Donald Trump: masterful propaganda that is bona fide genius in some ways, but at the same time gives me this uneasy feeling that it's really not all it's cracked up to be.A lot of glowing things people say about this movie are totally true. This movie has the MOST amazing visuals I have ever seen, and they were all done only using props and locations -- no CGI. Not even any particularly sophisticated practical effects like in a billion-dollar Guillermo Del Toro flick.And the ""symbolism"" very often does seem to point to interesting hidden truths. For instance, the protagonist resembles Jesus, but he is shown passed out and soaked in his own urine. Is Jodorowski encouraging us to have as much compassion for our debauched and unworthy selves as Jesus? Is his use of deformed actors a clever allegory for how we relate to aspects of ourselves which we consider inferior or unworthy? There's a lot of these sweet little rabbit-hole invitations throughout this movie. But then this profoundly allegorical vision-fest throws a whole lot of disgusting images and themes at me that don't exalt or provoke thought, they just repel. An army of people holding up skinned and crucified dogs? WTF does that have to do with anything? An old man giving his prosthetic eye to a pre-pubescent prostitute? A titan of industry who makes decisions based on whether the mannequin of his dead wife's pussy is wet or not? Oh yeah, and how seven of the world's most powerful and evil people are treated to a guided path to enlightenment rather than being punished. What's this supposed to mean? I guess that I should cheer them on because the movie is so visually amazing. Bleah. The whole thing is gorgeous and intelligent, but the spirit behind is just somehow decadent and sick."
90,The Holy Mountain,8,2 July 2015,Holy Moly!,"The only Alejandro Jodorowsky film I had seen prior to The Holy Mountain was El Topo. I thought El Topo was one of the weirdest films I'd ever seen with a gunslinger traipsing around the desert with a naked child on his back and encountering a corrupt town full of disabled people. Could things get much weirder than that? Yes they bloody could. You know a film is going to a little bit off the wall when it has the line, ""Your sacrifice has completed my sanctuary of 1,000 testicles."" El Topo seems as deadly realistic as a Michael Haneke film compared to Alejandro's The Holy Mountain. I made a list of weird movies a while ago and placed Eraserhead as my number one weirdest. If I were to revise that list, I'd definitely place The Holy Mountain directly behind Eraserhead. It's that weird.Casual moviegoers beware. This is a film funded by John Lenon and Yoko Ono so it isn't your average Owen Wilson cosy romcom. Within in the first half hour we're bombarded with bizarre imagery. A man who looks like Jesus walks around a dreamlike town full of frogs in clothes getting blown to smithereens, Jesus statues made out of sponge cake, armless dwarfs, sex in the street and eyeless paedophiles. All of this section is told without dialogue bar a few screams and Baldy Man styled gibberish.I was so taken back at the sheer amount of strangeness. Every single shot has severely strange imagery in it. It's like a Salvador Dali painting coming to life and the pacing is so fast, especially in the first act. There's no point trying to read the symbolism because too much happens, too quickly. The best thing to do is just let the film wash over you like some sort of fountain of oddness. Even after reading some ideas on the film I still have no idea what any of it means. However, my guess is that Alejandro isn't a fan of religion or weapons, but he is a fan of nudity and animals. In fact, I'm pretty sure that they cleared out London zoo to make this film.The second act takes a slower pace, but is no less bizarre. The production design in this section is pretty astonishing. I was particularly astounded by the rainbow room which seems like something from another world. A kind of plot does kick in with our Jesus hero meeting a 'master' (played by madman Alejandro Jodorowsky himself) who plans to take him and a bunch of increasingly bizarre misfits on a quest to meet the gods. We're introduced to nine new characters in quick succession. All of them have a detailed backstory involving everything from orgasm machines to testicle collections. This section does get a little repetitive and lengthy but it's entertaining nonetheless.The rest of the film follows the oddballs on the quest to meet the gods. Compared to the weirdness overload we've been having, this section does feel a little less weird so it's less memorable. I do have to say though that it acuminates into one of the best endings to a film I've ever seen. It's incredibly jarring and the most postmodern thing I've seen since The Cabin in the Woods.So what else can I say about The Holy Mountain? As its trailer states, it's a film which defies conventional plot and criticism. It's like a piece of art or music. It's something you have to feel and depending on what you felt, you either like it or you don't! As a connoisseur of the weird, I really liked it. It definitely leaves an impression and leaves you with an army of images you won't forget in a hurry. Unfortunately, it's not quite as hypnotic and dreamlike as it could've been thanks (or no thanks) to Alejandro's directing style. The film feels quite detached and objective. I think the film would've been stronger if it was seen more through the eyes of the Jesus character. The reason I love David Lynch films so much is that he takes us on an experience with the characters. Alejandro shoots like we're just spectators and so part of the experience is lost.The Holy Mountain is still an extraordinary film though. It's rich and full of surrealist imagery. It's almost like the ultimate surreal film with so much impenetrable symbolism crammed in to make your brain melt. Most average moviegoers won't make it pass the first ten minutes, but then again why would an average moviegoer attain a copy of The Holy Mountain? For the rest of us weirdos, this is unmissable!"
91,The Holy Mountain,9,18 March 2014,What a feeling!,"There are the obvious social themes and ideas that are pushed across in the film, which were relevant at the time, are still relevant today and a powerful message. But above all, above all! You have to just sit back and watch this film. Admire the care taken to construct a picture like this, of this caliber. The repetition, the color, the sheer beauty, really is unparalleled. The way Jodorowsky uses music I feel can't be compared to any other director. The way he uses tribal drumming and chanting to set a mood has your heart race in a way that builds suspense and keeps you on edge similarly to electronic music of present day. Such an eye opening and enlightening experience. This is how a film should be: an experience, a feeling. I was captivated and moved to tears. Lord, what a picture."
92,The Holy Mountain,9,13 August 2008,Holy Mountain... purely an experience made from awesome,"Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain is excellent. And when I say EXCELLENT I MEAN EXCELLENT. I can accept that this film may not be for everyone. But whilst this may be biased, it is moronic for those who CAN withhold the imagery to simply write it off before making the credits. Whilst there is debate on significance of symbolism and the like within the film, I feel that people who participate in such thoughts may be missing the moral of the story. The fact that Jodorowsky went to such an extent only furthers the message delivered at the end. (Which is what the whole film is built upon) I'd say its defintley worth some replay value, as they may have been some elements I missed on the first or second encounter with it. Moving on to watch other works of Jodorowsky, I'd say that this is easily the best. Plain epic.ALSO: I'm not sure about the validity of this, but originally Lennon was set to star in it?"
93,The Holy Mountain,10,26 July 2007,"Disturbingly beautiful, thoughtful, free from the cinematic boundaries","Much like Alejandro Jodorowsky's previous work ""El Topo"", ""The Holy Mountain"" is a deeply spiritual movie. Although here Jodorowsky takes that to the extreme, spinning a surrealistic tale about a man whose journey leads him on a quest for immortality. The film is a visual bombardment of the senses in which series of bizarre and often symbolic scenes are what is used to drive the plot forwards and Jodorowsky knits them together in a perfectly twisted logical way. Turning the film into a truly unforgettable experience.""The Holy Mountain"" is a confusing movie at first, but clearer and clearer as it moves to it's conclusion. And though chances are it won't make perfect sense after the first viewing, that is quite enough to spawn a general idea of what it is about.Jodorowsky has much to say about human nature. As seen from the early beginning of the film, a half hour compilation of violently humorous yet disturbing sequences that present several, uncomfortable facts about the world we live in. After those are through the movie's plot begins to move forward. As mentioned earlier it involves a man's quest for immortality. That man, The Alchemist played by Jodorowsky himself leads in his journey a group of nine other individuals searching for the same thing. Eight of them are leaders of a separate planet, each with a background explained. With them, Jodorowsky proceeds to further his criticism aimed at humanity. While different these backgrounds share one common and vital characteristic, those eight people are all vile repulsive human beings, drawing their gains from the suffering induced upon others. Though their motives are shallow and transparent their journey to the Holy Mountain where immortality lies will have a profound effect on each and every one of them. Thus leading into a conclusion that is equally satisfying yet unsuspected.Visually speaking Jodorowsky has made an work of art. Cinematography is perfect, set design is unbelievable, the music fits with the atmosphere and it's just oh so magnificent. Watching every scene, every shot, every movement of the camera, every weird act performed. Disturbing yet funny, perverse yet beautiful, violent yet touching the film carries so many distinct emotions that it become hard to categorize it in any of the known genres.Beneath all it's visual content - violence, disturbing and sometimes perverse imagery, ""The Holy Mountain"" is and forever will be one of the most morally conscience and humane movies made. A bizarre surrealistic satire that not only laughs at the diseased human nature but also offers a potential cure for it. Alejandro Jodorowsky's masterpiece achieves immortality."
94,The Holy Mountain,,18 October 2004,A strange film with no script and no characters,"The Holy Mountain is a piece of crap. The director Alejandro Jodorowsky seems to be still living in the 60's crazy days of Flower Power. However, the movie was released is 1975. The dream was over, the reality was cruel (the Vietnam war, America Latina's dictators etc), and there was no scape from the insanity of real life.This film is too symbolic that looks like some stupid story written by a 18 LSD addicted boy. There are no plot, no script, no characters, no performances. Some scenes resemble Pasolini's Salo (e.g., the faeces been boiled), but lacking the social context of the latter. Besides, the few dialogs resemble B science fiction movies from the 50's: ""I am from Mars"", or ""I am from Venus"". Come on, guys! Where is the so-called ingenious director? A mess of ideas is not enough to build a strong movie. A lot of people sweep the net in search for The Holy Mountain. Please, do not waste your time. The film is boring and an anachronism, a naive attempt to show the typical trait of a time that has gone. A good friend of mine told me this is a pop masterpiece. I guess he is out of his mind. Not even Jodorowsky should know what he did here."
95,The Holy Mountain,7,31 March 2015,"Holy crap, this movie is so weird. The movie is a bit like excrement. It can change itself into gold, if it wanted to, but it's still kinda excrement.","You really have to be an open-minded to kinda enjoy the film. If not, you might find, this art-house film to be turn-off, due to its very offensive, out-there bizarre nature. Directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky, the movie is loosely based on two books, Ascent of Mount Carmel by John of the Cross and Mount Analogue by René Daumal. The film is seem as either a spiritual or an outright actual sequel to Alejandro Jodorowsky's 1970 film, El Topo. A lot of similarity can be seem, between both films, but for me, it's look like a way different film. This movie tells the story of a thief (Horacio Salinas) that looks like Jesus Christ, living in a corrupt, greed-fueled fascism state-city, where everybody is trying to find enlightenment. Tired of people mistaking him, for a prophet, he seek out a real prophet, a powerful alchemist (Alejandro Jodorowsky), that will take him and seven materialistic God-like figures from other planets to the Holy Mountain, where they hope to achieve, the ultimate enlightenment and find the real reason of being. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found it to be a thinking man type of a film. The movie tackles religion, consumerism, depravity, and others. The movie is full of powerful visual symbolisms. There are too many to count. All of them, beautiful shot with the camera. Some of those symbolism were needed for the plot, but others just seemed unnecessary or random. Birds and fruits coming from wounds! Was that really needed?! A lot of the imagery are WTF moments, like the dead bodies doing a sexy dance or the robot ejaculating. It was cringe-worthy & jarring. There were some LOL, corny moments, such as the thief eating the body of Jesus Christ. Looks like a yummy cake. Then, there is a scene where the thief riding a giant hook, while dress in a speedo. It so remind me of 1974's Zardoz. While, some of the symbolism scenes are silly. Most of them, do make sense, if you, deeply think about it. The surreal fantasy film might sound preachy and judgmental, but this brilliant exposition of philosophy through art, was pretty alright for the most part. The things that I didn't like, about the film is that animals were harmed while making this movie. Lots of mistreatment. Watching frogs getting blown up is kinda mess up! PETA would had jumped on this film, if they knew, what they were doing. Another fault, I didn't like the movie is Jodorowsky instructing, the audience is take drugs for the purpose of spiritual exploration. I, for one, don't believe with Jodorowky's belief, that drugs are needed to gain higher spiritual meditation. Drugs do kill people and wreck lives. For him to administered psilocybin mushrooms to his actors during the shooting of the death-rebirth scene is illegal and wrong. I was deeply surprise that nobody overdose, during the filming of this movie. Still, in some recounts, during filming, an actor on LSD almost actually cut off the other guy's testicles with a real pair of scissors. Another near accident was when a actor actually struck Jodorowsky for real, cutting his neck and nearly killing him. Jodorowsky reflects that had the sword actually been real, he would indeed have been decapitated. That's dangerous! Another thing, I didn't like, is his use of child nudity. Like his previous film, 1970's El Topo, I was very uncomfortable, in seeing nude children for a movie made for profit. I can understand, adult women and men, because they have a choice in the matter, if they decide to go nude for the arts or not, but children aren't given that choice. Other people make that choice for them. In my opinion, I'm not for censoring, but if they were something to censor, it would be the exploiting of children. I don't care if, it's the hippie 1970s and the parents were OK, in showing their children nude. Showing nudity in children is wrong. That's a big No-no! The movie could have, really gone worst. A scene featuring a boy around the age of 10 stroking the naked buttocks of a girl his age while both are in bed, positioned as if they had just had sex, was deleted from the film. If they did, keep it. I would call this movie, 'trash'. I'm still, surprise, on how much of the children being nude, footage, they got away with. I'm deeply disappointed in Mexican law in this regard. They should have better, protection for children. Even people that fund the film, like Beatles George Harrison, was against all the nudity. He was originally up for the role of The Thief, but disagreed with the director over the issue. Jodorowsky stood his ground about it, prompting Harrison to drop out. Jodorowsky later expressed some regret over this, noting that Harrison's involvement could have exposed the film to an even larger audience. Sadly it didn't happen. The twist in the end could be surprising to some. Breaking the fourth wall was pretty bold. Without spoiling too much, the end tackles the issue of escapism. Jodorowsky is indeed attacking the world of images, of mana/samsara with this decision. In a way, Jodorowsky's film is one big joke on the viewer. It's reasons like this, why people might hate the film, as they felt it a waste of time. Even if one doesn't try to understand the movie, they should see the film for the incredible beauty and poetry. After all, it feels so dream-like. Overall: The Holy Mountain is indeed a complicated and visually stunning journey into spiritual transcendence. It eventually became a cult film. Despite that, I think the movie is little overrated. It's a bit confusing, and out-there. In my opinion, it's a good movie, but not that good. Still, I do recommended it. It's indeed an acid trip experimental film that need to be seen. At least, once."
96,The Holy Mountain,6,8 May 2008,A colorful journey to revelation,"Well, I needed to post a comment about this one simply because I was born in the year for release, 1973. I have studied film theory and mass media and found this film to provide interesting perspectives along obscenity. The main message here, is a critique against the commercialism of commodities in every land and society. Every commodity is possible to make profit from; sex, drugs, lifestyle, economics to warfare including religious artefact's. Somehow it gives you some sort of better insight upon complex matters that are as suitable to our modern world. It's a crazy, drugged-up ride with genuine characters nicely played by to me unknown actors. A real pity that the film starts to drag by the end, to much zen-Buddhism to new age-mysticism to keep me astounded..."
97,The Holy Mountain,7,22 August 2007,Best film from surreal master Jodorowski,"El Topo is better known, but The Holy Mountain is the best film of surreal master Alejandro Jodorowski (born in Chile, based in Mexico during his film career and now living in France as a comic book artist). Shot in luscious color, this little known masterpiece was unavailable for viewing for decades, due to a dispute between the director and the producer. To describe what the movie is about is close to a meaningless exercise: let's say that after a series of outrageous visual gags (the conquest of Mexico as performed by frogs?), some kind of plot emerges, as the Alchemist (Jodorowski himself) assembles a group of people named after planets (?) in order to prepare them to climb a sacred hill for some world threatening event. And when one less expects it, the movie's fourth wall emerges, in the film's funniest gag. This is free association surrealism: Jodorowski throws about ten visual jokes per minute, about only one really works, but this means you can stop laughing and marveling all the time. The movie is also highly sacrilegious and scatological, so it is obviously not for everyone."
98,The Holy Mountain,,21 November 2004,Allegory vs. Absurdity.,"I see a film like this and I'm reminded of W.S. Burroughs statement, ""the Word is a Virus."" Then again, this film's writer/director has background in modern theatre, for a start, he was staging ""happenings"" years before they became fashionable. All the set pieces in this film were inspired by that experience. If you aren't familiar with Artaud, Oldenburg, and Crowley, this film isn't going to mean much to you. This isn't a film for the ""average"" Ugly American, and frankly, as a veteran and an artist, I'm turning my back on the majority of my ""fellow"" Americans anyway. This is the Internet people, it's international, just like this film. The lack of exposition detracts from it all of a little, i.e. there's almost no dialogue, but after all, this is a film and I'm stunned at how set piece after set piece was shot.It works on purely intuitive and VISUAL levels, people, so don't take any of it literally. If it could be said out loud, why film it?"
99,The Holy Mountain,,18 January 2004,Warning: this film can trigger acid flashbacks,"It is not even advisable for just anyone to see this film. Not everyone is interested in this kind of experience. Personally I found it an illumination. Weird to the point of overloading your mind. I know these descriptions are so extreme that people will assume I am exaggerating. It saddens me greatly that it and ""El Topo"" are out of print. I think it needs to be made available now!"
100,The Holy Mountain,,27 December 1999,Very Strange!!!,"One word. Surreal!! I mean really Surreal!!!! I didn't realize what I would be experiencing when I rented this, but it is without question one of the most bizarre trips you'll ever witness in your life!!!!SURREALIST SPOILER In short, Christ explores a world with a near limb-less handicapped man (often carrying him on his back)....the two venture in to town where Asian tourists are murdered execution style by soldiers wearing gas masks....while on-lookers in Sombreros take photos. Then Christ and the little man get hired by small circus to showcase a battle between Frogs and Chameleons in miniature Spanish conquistadors uniforms ..... Christ then gets drunk with Romans who make a mold of him and duplicate him... Christ gets angry and destroys the duplications (but keeps one for himself)...then runs into an Army of Mary Magdalen prostitutes...... This film also explores a surreal point of view on Astrology. In other words the planets and their influence on this incredibly bizarre world!!! END SURREALIST SPOILERI realize that words can not even begin to describe this film, so I'll stop my self prematurely. You'll simply have to see it to believe it.The first thing that popped in to my head when watching this film was a video documentary I once saw about the ""1st generation of film-school directors"". When Martin Scorsese was in NYU's film school he described seeing films from ULCA and USC that were very ""psychedelic and ""slick"". The documentary then showed clips of dwarfs on psychedelic sets with very strange visual effects. One could clearly see that the west coast ""psychedelic"" style was much different than the east coast ""tough lower east-side"" style. Scorsese explained it with much laughter: ""They had more powerful drugs on the west coast than we did on the east coast.""I don't know much about Alejandro Jodorowsky film career, but I don't think this film was simply conceived out of a drug induced state. Jodorowsky is a masterful surrealist and of course, artist.  He had to be influenced by Dali at some point. As for the surrealist movement in general, cheers to those who stray from the beaten path, otherwise everything (much like Hollywood) would be the same story told over and over again in a different way. Surrealist film makers are the true engineers of film. Instead of advancing the technology of film itself, Surrealists advance the technology of telling a story by taking huge risks which may make the characters or outcome un-likeable by many. These so called ""risks"" are often regarded as crap by the more feeble minded and conceptual breakthroughs by the more open minded.
This film is astonishing, disturbing and just plain weird. I really enjoyed it!!!"
101,The Holy Mountain,7,2 March 2009,weird....yeah really weird,"OK, so this movie was by far the weirdest movie i have ever seen... i mean i know everyone is supposed to ooh and aahh at the would be profound, if edgy, symbolism, which of course there is to some extent. not that anyones really sure what everything means... i think (and i apologise to those who have said this before me, of which I'm sure there are many) that Alejandro Jodorowsky decided to experiment with a different cocktail of hardcore drugs at the beginning of every scene. lets be honest, it would definitely explain a lot. a lot more in fact than can be explained through metaphors... unless of course you too have ingested a highly dangerous substance while watching the film, in which case you also have a fairly high chance of dying from the plain weirdness of the whole situation. ultimately it was an interesting movie, certainly kept me guessing til the end. (but mainly making various contorted faces of confusion and often disbelief)"
102,The Holy Mountain,7,22 June 2008,The religion of the absurd,"Before viewing this Jodoroswy's film I had heard an endless number of adjectives describing it, in one way or another, the many characteristics of it. Far from being a subversive, anti-religious, spiritual or incomprehensible movie, the Chilean director decided to make a mockery of what we consider religion, of the beliefs that every human being has and the defects of cling to an absolute truth, that far from being unattainable, becomes unusable in the hands of people who are not ready to understand it, and much worse, the search becomes an obstacle to the significance of being, to the real meaning of life: happiness.So the film brings together a group of people representing the planets of the solar system and introduces us to the world of each, allegorical representation of the concerns and attitudes of modern man, to embark on a journey to the holy mountain in the company of master and the son of God made man with the unique result: to reach the only truth. This is where Jodorowsky masterfully gives an excellent conclusion: all religions are true until respect the mind and thoughts and the absolute truth is impossible to achieve, just enough to live.Despite all the analogies and symbolism that manages the film, the mistake of the actor-director-writer is desired to cover too many topics so this make baroque the film and convert it into something indecipherable or nonsense, devoid of symbolic value, Is there when one, as a spectator, feels tired for everything that has seen and that amount of useless information is which makes people miss the true value of the proposal.Still is an excellent film that breaks with the canons of cinema in all its facets, just, as said Jodorowsky just to finish the story, take this as a mere fiction, for what it is: a movie."
103,The Holy Mountain,7,16 July 2007,hippie trippy jodorowsky,"After having recently revisited ""El Topo"" after decades, and seen ""Fando and Lis"" for the first time, and finally seeing the legendary ""Holy Mountain"", I have a new appraisal of the unique and yet derivative Jodorowsky. His messianic complex is obvious, and his transfixing performances can be powerful or overbearing. But as a director of his time, he was at the center of an international hippie-trippy school of cinema.Not that hippie-trippy is a bad thing; I embraced and embrace the path of consciousness-expansion, which now is knee-jerked as the beginning of the druggy society but became a quest for meaning, awareness, and compassion. But when Jodorowsky practically shoves acid caps into the audience's mouths in one scene of ""Holy Mountain,"" he subverts his real message, which is nothing less than his exploration of the (Catholic) church and his vision of the real messiah, and a society that might exist if people followed that light.So profundity is natural to Jodorowsky as is farce and forced Felliniesque grotesques. ""Holy Mountain"" can be considered just as a trippy series of elaborate and often dazzling scenes, with random stories from characters from all the planets of the solar system (we're talking trippy!) but is much nobler in intent.It is obvious that Jodorowsky was influenced by Fellini and Bunuel but also by Kenneth Anger and the NY and SF underground, I imagine ""Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome"" was a big favorite, and Godard was influencing everyone with a political and visual bone, especially with ""Weekend"" which gave flower power even a greater activist streak. Jodorowsky's contemporary hippie-trippy auteurs were Makavejev with the great ""WR: Mysteries of the Orgasm"" and the completely outrageous ""Sweet Movie""; Conrad Rooks with the serious and stunning ""Chappaqua""; ""Zachariah"", a popular tripping American Western version of ""Siddhartha"" with a very interesting musical cast; Corman's ""The Trip"" that I've seen at least a dozen times, most in the late 60s, with the great cast Fonda-Hopper-Dern-Strasberg written by Nicholson on something lysergic; Roeg and Cammell's ""Performance"" which is as trippy as they come, as scary, as musically intense--sexual gangsterism and repression and true seeking with the aid of a mushroom. And I have to mention Gilliam's high-tech and high-tension ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", with Depp and the good Doctor sizing up the essential consciousness-gap of the 60s, and jointly creating a great document of the fringe of the movement of the mind.""Holy Mountain"" is worth the trip even if Jodorowsky overblows the message and then ends it with a Godardian twist. But the age of Aquarius is STILL dawning, my friends..."
104,The Holy Mountain,,6 August 2005,the circus comes to town,After seeing this film again after the first time i saw it a few years ago i came to new conclusions about the film. I understood Jodorowsky's circus background and could clearly see processions of people and props/displays being used--- similar to Fando y Lis and El Topo--- Still good in their own right.... Funny how trapped it is into the 60's counter culture and this sense of free love and sex freaks--- with today's different social climate this seems fairly unreasonable (possibly more fun) version of todays 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord of the Rings' escapists. I like how the spiritual energy kept the film at a high buzzing sound for many staged and well directed delusionals (iconic representations) of the internal world
105,The Holy Mountain,9,28 February 2001,this film knows no depths of interest....,"Occasionally a film comes along that totally blows your mind away.for me, The holy mountain is such a film.  full of bizarre yet somehow desirable metaphorical insights, sometimes helpful, sometimes totally perverting, this movie leaves your mind as a puddle by the end of it.At first i thought this movie's central character was the hopeful yet somewhat naive jesus character, but then once one has watched this movie all the way through, you realise that for your average youth, chucho-chucho, the led astray chimp, is the central character.  he/she is led to follow the journeys of the group of immortality seeking adventurers, through their own personal, perverted, sadistic paths.Very creative, boundary stretching, and totally unique. gotta watch it!    (but not too much)"
106,The Holy Mountain,9,28 February 2009,Unprecedented Visual Stream of Consciousness,"The Holy Mountain, from beginning to end, is unprecedented visual stream of consciousness. How to gather all the pieces of it together in order to describe it cohesively, I don't know, but that is not to say that it leads to nowhere. Though, that's not to say it doesn't either. There is a painting in the Cincinnati Art Museum that reminds me of its structure. It is apparently a portrait of the subconscious, colors, shapes and vectors seemingly exploding from an unassuming black dot in the middle. But what makes the film so astonishing is not simply its explosive, hyper-colorful, surprising, non-sequitary, often joyously sacrilegious juxtapositions, for it could hardly hold one's provocation throughout its entirety. The subject matter of which it's wildly composed is what ignites the spark.The tarot card The Fool tends to depict a man stepping off a cliff. This movie is The Fool's continuing adventures in the world of the occult and metaphysical. He lies face down on the ground, and is soon befriended by a basket case dwarf. He goes into a city where his resemblance to Christ inspires some to use his likeness for the crucifixes which they sell. Sooner or later, after a psychedelic carnival of non-sequitary fellowships between time periods and other spatially incompatible creatures, objects and ideas, he notices a crowd gathered around a large tower, where a large hook with a bag of gold has been sent down in exchange for food. Wishing to find the source of the gold, he ascends the tower, finding an alchemist, played by director Jodorowsky himself.The fool is introduced to seven people who are said to be the most powerful mortals in the solar system. They are related to the planets in astrological terms, each embodying the worst aspects of his or her planet's characteristics. The seven consist of: a Venusian cosmetics manufacturer, a Martian weapons manufacturer, a Jupiterian millionaire art dealer, a Saturnine war toy maker, a Uranian political financial adviser, a Neptunian police chief and a Plutonian architect. These segments are explosively hilarious depending on how acquainted one is with astrology; I happen to know quite a lot about it, and so these introductions are most of what make the movie for me. They are gathered together by the alchemist who instructs them to burn their money and wax images of themselves. Being a follower of astrology, this completely absorbed me. Never has there ever been a film that portrays the Zodiacal planetary alignments and influences, nor embellishing each configuration with such broad-brush satire.After several scenes wherein the characters are led through several rituals, they all journey to gain the secret of immortality from nine immortal gurus who live on a holy mountain. What the film seems to ultimately be about is how we are mobilized by how fascinated we are with spectacle, with which the movie is overflowing. Early on, I was beginning to feel that I was going to have no way of connecting to the imagery I was seeing, how it was going to tell a story, or be cohesive at all, except that I admired its richness and vivid imagination, and huge involvement of all kinds of animals. But I was soon enraptured by the mystical subjects the film uniquely tackles, and Jodorowsky soon has me going on this curious journey with his abstract representational characters and being surprised and provoked till the very stunningly self-reflexive end."
107,The Holy Mountain,10,26 June 2003,A Greatly Flawed Potential Masterpiece By a Mystic Visionary,"First off, I have to say that I felt that the first hour of Holy Mountain contained some of the most amazing scenes I have ever viewed.  However, once Holy Mountain starts to become a new-age sermon about getting back in touch with nature, the movie fell apart.  It's too bad because this movie could have been one of the best, most hallucinatory movies ever made, like La Dolce Vita, but on acid.  Nevertheless, I still believe that Jodorowsky is a genius, and I look forward to whatever future projects he may work on!"
108,The Holy Mountain,8,18 March 2003,holy acid trip!,This film is by the guy who said 'I am to film what LSD is to the mind'. That is exactly right in this movie.  It makes sense on a higher level of consciousness which most won't catch by seeing the barrage of symbolic images and scenes linked together..however it is a masterpiece of weird cinema.  If you're not into pretentious surreal art like Salvador Dali then this isn't for you.  He later did Santa Sangre which is an amazing film with a more coherent story.
109,The Holy Mountain,10,22 December 1999,A masterpiece of surrealist cinema.,"This is probably one of my 5 favorite films of all time.  The visuals are exquisite.  It can't be described, only experienced.  Roughly, it is about an individual's quest for enlightenment.  Not for everyone (i.e. the religiously uptight)."
110,The Holy Mountain,8,18 November 2000,"if you can find a copy, go see this movie!","jodorowsky said that he ""look for in films what north americans look for in drugs"".  and after watching this film, it shows.i don't know how to describe this film and i won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it, just watch the first 20 minutes and you'll understand why."
111,The Holy Mountain,9,15 August 2000,"A trip into the surreal, funny and just down right strange.",I really do not where to start with this film. Ok ill start with this. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!. This film has many religous refrences but ill be damned if i no what religion. There are many surreal moments in the holy mountain that make no sense they leave you with a blank expression on your face and you dont really no what to think. Here is an example of three such moments. 1. A old man is found under a big cloth on a mountain he has breasts. Then suddenly each breast turns into cheeta head and sprays milk. 2. A huge toilet with a fat naked woman on it and beside her a man in bed with a horse. 3. The hall of a thousand testicles.I really cannot describe to you what this film is like the matrix you have to see it for yourself.My verdict 9/10(after watching this film i was in a dream like state for about an hour)
112,The Holy Mountain,10,8 August 2000,Excellent,"It's hard to write a review for this movie because it is undescribable. There are scenes and images in this movie that will stay with you for a long time. This was the director's ""mescaline movie"" so it is hard to figure out at times, but if you pay attention is should all make sense. This was made 15 years ago and has still never once been released in the U.S. However the director's earlier movie Fando and Lis has been released on DVD, so there's still hope. But for now the Japanese bootlegs are good enough. Highly recommended."
113,The Holy Mountain,10,12 March 2008,Getting High with Jesus On Earth,"And exploring foreign policy with Eva Peron on Saturn. Actually, Holy Mountain (1973), despite common perceptions (yet it is undeniable that many filmmakers from around the time this film was constructed, apart form actor Cary Grant, perhaps Jodorowsky even, might have affirmed that Lysergic Acid Diethylamide was in fact the key to the locked vice that is the universe) is not a drug film. It's quite a shame, actually, that this kind of film-making that Jodorowsky was after is evidently a thing of the past. I don't know, maybe it's the Iraq War, but I think the modern viewer better relates with Jodorowsky's other substantially more unified piece of art, a sort of Spaghetti Western of a nightmare-breakdown, El Topo (1970), the director's other famous picture released not more than three years prior to Holy Mountain.Unlike El Topo, Holy Mountain has a tendency to shift gears much more rapidly and displays an openness (not necessarily in the spacial sense) to become something completely different at any given moment. At the start of the film, we're reminded much of Fellini's Amarcord (1973) with a little Satyricon (1969) mixed in. Then we're moved on to Satanic Ritual and visuals not unlike those found in the later films of Kenneth Anger. Mid-movie, the director starts to essay on industrialism and the factory-produced characteristics of modern art which of course is bought and sold but you know that.Every great art film director, particularly great European art film directors (Jodorowsky, while Latin American, lives in France) from the late sixties and early seventies wanted to make movies like Federico Fellini, however very few of them did. Antonioni sort of went there in that carnival direction at the beginning and end of Blow-Up (1966) however; he never took it as far as Jodorowsky advances the Fellini stylistics of cinema in Holy Mountain. Dusan Makavejev's Sweet Movie (1974) accomplishes something similar to Holy Mountain, potentially quite a bit better, but, in my mind, the jury is still out. I recommend viewing the two films in sequence or, who knows, maybe it is just better if you watch them both at the same time.If you're a bored cinephile, looking for new images, heretofore unseen images, and you haven't checked this one out yet, now might be the time. The new Anchor Bay DVD reproduction of the Techniscopic process is super clean. Once great aspect to film material is that it just gets better with time. But getting down with Holy Mountain, you must remember, with a piece like that: the confrontation-tension exists not up there on the screen between the ""characters"" but rather between the mystical light-specter, The Holy Mountain and YOU. So dig in and, ""Zoom back camera!"""
114,The Holy Mountain,6,8 May 2004,Will you laugh or cry - probably both...,"This is a film of exceptonal originality and achievement.  It goes generally unnoticed by film fans but deserves a place in cinema history as a representaition of cinema in its purest of forms.A highly visual and aural experience, with no real relevance or meaning. It's basically a mad head trip of a film full of freaks, freakish happenings and even more freakiness.The production values are high and it shows - Jorodovsky really let rip with this one.It's a quite disturbing film at times, with some of the exploits feeling unnessesary (but I suppose thats the point) so watch it when totally sh*t faced on drink/drugs/sunny delight and you'll have a great time!"
115,The Holy Mountain,10,29 November 2002,A real head f@*k. Amazing,You can almost forgive John Lennon for the terrible music he made in his last ten years when you consider he helped this film to be made through funding rounding up funding of £2million for the shoot.  This film rewards the viewer on repeated watching as you try to piece all the imagery with all those stories you were told in Sunday school. I have never seen anything like this film. Amazining and worth the attempt to try to obtain a copy.
116,The Holy Mountain,10,17 December 2001,Mind-blowing.,"I first saw this movie at a friend's house, who essentially sat me down in front of the TV, put this movie on, and made me sit and watch.  At first I was a little skeptical; I tend to be somewhat picky when it comes to the movies I watch, and the vague description of it he'd given me hadn't exactly piqued my interest.  Right from the first frame though, I was drawn in by the sheer visual artistry and deep symbolism, almost hypnotized by the magic on the screen before me.True, many people won't understand much of it the first time or two they watch; in fact few will perceive any of the underlying symbolism until several viewings later.  But with each subsequent viewing more and more becomes evident, even obvious where it had been obscure before, and the viewer will find themselves even more mesmerized and in love with the sheer beauty than previously.Truly a mind-blowing movie, that had an ~enormous~ impact on me, my life, and my mind."
117,The Holy Mountain,10,25 May 2000,A fulfilling allegory,"What is enlightenment, and how could people be brought closer to it through a film?  The solution is unexpectedly delightful.The way I see it, the Christ in this film represents the individual who, bombarded from all directions by the absurdities of life on Earth, embarks on a quest for higher meaning - a familiar story.  In this version, however, the author seems to be knowledgeable in esoterica:  turning (****) into gold, which is often thought of the ultimate goal of alchemy, is just a starting point here.  The film leads away from ""reality"", to death and beyond, ultimately coming to a new ""reality"" that can be digested to varying degrees, depending on one's state of mind (open/closed/other).  There are plenty of obstacles along the path, as well as plenty of entertainment, including biting sociopolitical satire and a very strong dose of 70's psychedelia.I don't mean to raise expectations to unreasonable heights, but I consider the film's conclusion a rubedo, a transformation that surpasses the simple moral that a story is ""supposed"" to have.  Though unoriginal, it works so well that I gave it a 10.  (Shakespeare wasn't original either - who cares?) Fans of Fellini and Bun~uel will probably feel quite comfortable."
118,The Holy Mountain,10,29 October 1999,A phantasmagoric experience to remember,"This is a film that will amaze the viewer with its phantasmagoric and obscure imagery, and will shock some with its over-abundance of crucifixes of Christ. It really is an experience to be bombarded with all the surreal images. The story, loosely, is about an alchemist (played by Jodorowsky) who gathers some followers to accompany him to the Holy Mountain to seek eternal life. On the way we are told by various gods how life is on their particular planets, and it is different on each planet with outlandish environments and characters on each one. Just watch this film with your mind wide open and let it astound you. It certainly will. It is one of the most surreal and bizarre films you will ever see."
119,The Holy Mountain,,31 January 2001,what?,"what, what what what what? Jesus? Lambs on sticks?Beautiful. Watch it This film is amazing"
120,The Holy Mountain,8,18 February 2016,"Brilliant, abstract film - relatable themes and comedy abound.","This is a really good movie, I recommend it and if you haven't seen it, go to your nearest film library or streaming service and look for it and then watch it and then write a review. That's what I did and look at me - I'm happy.This movie is made with a particular eye for cinematography; juxtaposition, symbolism and geometric set design create a rather abstract black comedy/fantasy film that hangs together stylistically, even if having no traditional plot elements.The film focuses on a single, relatable theme: a mystic or 'divine teacher' is taking a group on a mission to the Holy Mountain, and through the process they leave the mechanistic, predatory world of social evils, mass produced goods and the hysteria and negativity of our constructed ""real"" societies - to find enlightenment.Cleverly, the film doesn't suggest that there is a real form of spiritual enlightenment through mystical dogma or obscure, ancient ""beliefs"", but encourages the audience to think about the importance of withdrawing from the artificiality of our day-to-day world in favour of finding ""the real"".The film is legendarily odd in its treatment of satire, sexuality and the directors predilection for filming exotic animals.Far better than its rather minor reputation, I recommend seeing Holy Mountain, preferably on a large projector screen or at a theater viewing."
121,The Holy Mountain,6,12 June 2015,Hmmm Interesting.,"I might be in the minority of people who loved El Topo.. but I did. So I decided to check out, at least for a little bit, The Holy Mountain. By comparison, it makes the surrealism in El Topo look like a walk in the park. This is one of the most deranged, gratuitous and uncomfortable works of shock art I've ever seen. Every element of this picture is meant to outrage.. but at the same time, meant to stimulate the human mind, wonder the human soul.. and maybe turn us on? Who knows? It's too far out for me to even begin. I don't recommend sitting through it all, because again, to most people a lot of this is nonsense. But, it's a strikingly beautiful piece of nonsense. This film is gorgeous to look at. The colors, and textures. The mis-en-scene in it's entirety is mind blowing. This is Jodorowsky's most sensually effective picture, and it's amazing to behold, albeit absolutely discomforting."
122,The Holy Mountain,5,14 September 2014,Something for when you are really....really...high,"I don't think I would have liked this movie at all if it wasn't for the way it was recommended to me: a couple crazy French friends, both computer science grad students who loved to party, said this was their favorite movie to get absolutely blazed to. I might have immediately jumped to the judgments many others have made e.g. this is a masturbatory, campy, art-for-artists, hippie-dippy, and poorly made piece of trash. All that is true; luckily for me I had the image of two giggling Frenchmen, stoned to obliteration watching this beyond lunacy, and that helped me to shake my head, laugh, and actually kinda enjoy....though I wish I too could have been (very) stoned and in the company of those who were likewise. Of course it's always a cop out to say you need to smoke in order to like a movie, but one must admit that certain types of films fit like a puzzle piece into that category ""good while high"", for certain types of weird people. This is one of those."
123,The Holy Mountain,8,23 February 2012,Makes the Book of Revelation look like a Winnie the Pooh story.,"From the mind that brought you El Topo, and nearly Dune (oh, the tragedy!), here is The Holy Mountain, a reinterpretation of the agony of Christ through a kaleidoscope of apocalyptic vignettes, set in the modern day of some hellish parallel dimension.Those of you who saw and loved El Topo should skip this review and just watch the film. Those of you who haven't well... watch El Topo first. There is no chronological and narrative link, but since Jodorowski's films favor style and ideas (which might be putting it too politely for some people), El Topo provides a less chaotic narrative and something resembling relatable archetypes.Here we have near-total chaos. The massacre of the Aztecs replayed with frogs and toads to a leering crowd, shamanistic rituals in a rainbow-colored tower, proto-Nazis raping tourists... If listing it makes little sense, seeing it just might, and like El Topo, the only work you can really compare this to - whether favorably or not is another question - is Dante's Inferno. A passive protagonist travels down a maze of horrors to reach an ultimate revelation/salvation. If you can feast on the strength of the sights alone, it has unforgettable wonders and horrors to offer. If not, this is a great background video for a stoner party, where can skip through the more outrageous bits.On an inspired viewing, I would give it a 10 for its boldness, imagery and mere existence, but I can't. It's just too exhausting an experience."
124,The Holy Mountain,,4 January 2012,What the f*ck did I just watch?,"Written, directed, guru'ed, and starring Alejandro Jodorowsky, ""La Montaña Sagrada"" (""The Holy Mountain"") is nothing less than a trip. To watch this movie, you must have you heart, mind, and spirit open. Your spiritual and mental sensitivities will be affronted in both good and offensive ways.It's no surprise that Jodorowsky and Marylin Manson have become collaborators (Jodorowsjy even officiated Manson's wedding). Jodorowsky's visuals are clearly a precursor to any of today's undermining, anti-conventional, blasphemous GaGas or Mansons; yet quite in line with your Lennons and Onos (that's right, John and Yoko help fund this feast).I found this movie on a mind-f*ck list from Quora.com). However, there is nothing entertaining or clever about ""The Holy Mountain"" - it is a serious and viscerally artistic expression of the search beyond oneself for enlightenment. This isn't ""Inception"" or ""The Matrix"", kids - grow up.If you love to question faith, the fabric of reality, or have realized the factory chuck mundanedity of today's film offerings, let Daddy Alejandro whisk you off to 1973 to change you forever."
125,The Holy Mountain,,16 October 2004,the third is OK?why don't you like,"i appreciate your previous comment, but the last part it's OK for..me( :( ).the sensory overload of the first is disgusting, the man who don't know the true life, and in the third there's a lot of ""reflexionar"" .is the movie maya ?,best the real life.!but the real life (the movie) it' s maya also! i love the horizontal-man. great! but the thief is mercury?Jodorowski is a initiate, multiform the man who lost himself!the pure love of the thief for his friend, it's egoistic love!!!wonderful don't take him on the ship!alejandro you're(i m sure you read it:) ) incredible, but i don't know, you take your gnostic message whit movie, books, painting , tarots ,impersonal love. but i think that also ""the shadow"" of the success it s really dangerous, also if you can touch million of people!"
126,The Holy Mountain,,18 September 2002,"poifect, aint it?","First, take a deep breath. Now after a momentary pause take another deep breath. Do these (deep breaths) for a few minutes then open YOUR eyes. That's right, now open your eyes and watch Jodorowski's THE HOLY MOUNTAIN. After viewing this magnum opus of a film, really open YOUR eyes and really take a deep breath for it will do a body good. Enjoy!!!"
127,The Holy Mountain,,5 April 1999,zowie,"Watching this film made me really wish that I had more than simply a working knowledge of world cosmologies.  It was often a struggle to decipher Jodorowski's symbolism, though the visual language was always incredible. The entire film held me spellbound.  I thought the first and last half hours were absolutely brilliant, though parts of the last minutes seemed a bit muddier, both in visual and narrative impact.  All in all, however, it is a film that makes me view the world differently."
128,The Holy Mountain,,9 November 1998,One on the list of 100 most bizarre films of all time...,"Jodoworsky is not held back by anything, as he decides to criticize the search for the meaning of life and the forms it has adapted.  Starts off by insulting Christian religion, then various aspects of businesses and the government, then society. Of course, by the time the group the ""alchemist"" has assembled is training in the Andes and you are dismissing this as a hippie flick, Jodoworsky insults the hippies.  At the end of course, when the meaning of life is to be revealed, he pulls off one of the strangest endings ever, sort of a ""why should you care about a film?"" ending..."
