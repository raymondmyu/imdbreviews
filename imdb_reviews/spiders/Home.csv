0,Home,6,4 April 2015,"OK, but disappointed","Took my 8-year-old girls. It was cute. They enjoyed it well enough.But on the car ride home, when I asked about their favorite part, the best they could come up with was the cow joke (I won't repeat it).After all the great animated kid's movies of the last 10 years (Nemo, Shrek, Cars, Frozen, etc), this one is completely forgettable. In a month or two, my girls won't even remember it. Can't imagine they'll ever ask to get a DVD or watch it at home.I'm not sorry I took them, nor was it a waste of money. But we are so spoiled by such great animated movies that a mediocre one like this becomes disappointing."
1,Home,7,19 July 2015,Clever and above average..!,"This is not the kind of movie that will stay with you forever. I have seen better animated movies in the past. BUT it's a movie that you will definitely have a good time watching, laughing and laughing again. I loved the way this little alien was depicted, using Jim Parsons' ticks and facial expressions! The concept of the aliens taking different colors based on their mood was just to die for!The story was OK and the time it lasted was sufficient (I always root for longer movies instead of shorter). Overall, it was a cute cute movie in the end! We laughed a lot, and although we are genre-fanatics (being in our 30s watching these movies without kids), I think that the average movie fan will also like it. It was time well-spent on a movie and I sincerely recommend it!"
2,Home,5,6 June 2015,Forgettable music video,"As a fan of animated films and Jim Parsons, Home felt like something I would enjoy. When the first Rihanna song started playing, I grew skeptical. When the next one started, I got tired of it. There's actually 5 Rihanna songs in the film. 5. Five. Along with Rihanna playing one of the lead roles. And I should mention that her character is not singing these songs. She's just listening and dancing to Rihanna. Sorry, but nope. Home started feeling like a commercial for some Rihanna album or a very long music video. I don't think I will remember this film, but if I do it would be for exactly that, and I would forget the story. However, if you're not like me and don't care about such things, the movie itself is pretty cute."
3,Home,5,10 August 2015,Weak - Dreamworks can do better than this!,"Oh dear... if you can get past the first half of the film then you may just enjoy the second half.Story (concept) was good but scripts were weak.Graphics were great.Humour was desperate.OK, I love animation movies with my kids, but hey, at 11 and 9, they were really disappointed and had look forward to this for a while.As for Rhianna, well, one kinda considered she funded the movie because her voice over is a leading part (which was good) but the 5 Rhianna tracks during the film.... a tad OTT!"
4,Home,10,21 March 2015,An Excellent Adventure with some good lessons to learn,"I had not really high expectations on an animated movie, my son would probably enjoy something like this way more than me I thought. Huge Fail. The movie was from the beginning great and not only for kids. It is a feel-good movie for all ages. It is about family , friendship and that being different or just being yourself is not a bad thing at all. I found the movie throughout entertaining and very often funny.The Boov's are just too funny in particular Steve Martin as the voice of Captain Smek, whose firm leadership of the Boov people is undermined by his ridiculous fascination with human artifacts such as bubble wrap . He reminded me partially on King Julien from the Penguins of Madagascar.But even if you are not touched by the great story you will certainly love the Soundtrack. The whole movie was perfectly set and is for me the best Dreamworks movie since a long time. Take your kids and watch it on the big screen, they will love it! and you too, guaranteed.Verdict: A great story meets perfect cast and nothing can go wrong on this alien/ human road trip movie."
5,Home,4,10 June 2015,As a friend of animation - this made me yawn,"I'm 30 years old, but I still enjoy watching animation films very much. As I heard that there was coming a movie with Jim Parsons & Steve Martin I knew I had to see it - specially when it was a film from Dreamworks.From seeing the trailer I already knew I didn't like the animation style too much, but I didn't let that bother me watching the movie. Sadly, B class style was one of the lesser flaws of the film.Jokes are outdated, movie is full of bubblegum pop music, the characters are far from interesting and you can't really build a connection to them. Also, the plot... oh phew. Way too easy. I mean, in most cases of animation films the plot is more or less predictable - after all, we're talking about western animations. They have a prodigy, who doesn't fit in, misses his/her parents and gets a happy ending. But Home just made my jaws sore from yawning.It wasn't _all_ bad, I'm sure that many kids will enjoy this, but for me this was one of Dreamworks' biggest flops. The only actual fun I had thinking about Jim Parsons and how literally every one of his lines could've been said in The Big Bang Theory."
6,Home,10,31 March 2015,"Great Animation, adventure and comedy .","Assalum Alaykum.This is a great animation,adventure and comedy movie. I am not surprised it is number 1 in most countries around the world.Escaping from their enemy the Gorgs, the Boov have found a new planet to call home, Earth. Guided by Captain Smek (Steve Martin), they start their friendly invasion of the planet, relocating the humans to other parts of the planet while the Boov inhabit their homes.In this movie the series of incidents are great from the beginning to the very end and believe me all the scenes are wonderful,the adventure is pleasing and the comedy is totally entertaining.The lovely surprise is that the great singer Rihanna acts in it."
7,Home,10,20 March 2015,Great family movie,"I saw this movie today with the kiddies. I would say it is a really solid movie. It is the story of an unlikely friendship that forms when an outcast alien meets a sassy little girl on a mission to find her mom. I think the story is well thought out and there are many hidden life ""gems"" noted within. The theme of judging others sticks out as well as themes of ""being yourself"" and learning from your mistakes. It is a little predictable but I think all adults feel that way about children's movies. The acting was good and surprisingly Rihanna did very good (I had my doubts about that). The kids loved it and laughed a lot. They also enjoyed the music a lot and that is really what it is all about. I would recommend it for families."
8,Home,10,19 March 2015,Exceeded my Expectations by a Mile!!!,"I think everyone with a family and even adults need to get up and see this movie. In my opinion, this puts Frozen in a corner forever. Seeing as the lead character is a hero with black descent, supporting this movie would majorly encourage more animation companies such as Disney, Pixar etc. to follow in their footsteps. There were so many laugh out loud moments and the message with this was so beautiful. Always stand what for what you believe in and stand by your friends. Even though this was an animation film involving aliens, It felt so realistic especially with the character Tip. Tip is a normal teenager with ""not-so-perfect"" hair, a tomboy lookalike, sassy and that's what makes her relatable. Not some fake or over-enthusiastic girly-girl that wants to find prince charming BS. To add to that, The music team did an amazing job. If you don't like animations, definitely go for the soundtrack or even better, purchase it. You wont be disappointed. Good on you Dreamworks, your hard work deserves to pay off."
9,Home,6,22 May 2015,The movie is a 6/10 at best. IMDb is infested by phony reviewers.,"This is less of a review of the movie Home than it is a review of what IMDb has become...infested by fake reviews from fake movie makers. But hey, we are talking about the movie industry here...why would anyone involved actually be ""real"" right? Home is exactly what the less-than- 7 reviews say it is. IMDb still has it's uses but it's rating/review section is virtually useless now. Some movies entertain both the children and the adults...this one will entertain ONLY the children. The plot is predictable the acting is OK, the animation is excellent, soft and candy-like...etc. But unfortunately, it's not very funny at all. Steve Martin's talent is wasted on the character Captain Smek, Rihanna's character is straight serious and Jim Parsons' voice, while inherently funny, simply isn't enough to pull off the very unfunny jokes. The kids might laugh at the Saturday Morning slapstick but that's about it. There is simply no way that any of these glowing 10-star reviews can be genuine. It's shameful...I'm not sure how much longer I'll be coming to IMDb."
10,Home,10,19 March 2015,Great movie!,What a lovely movie! Great for both kids and adults. Rihanna and Jim parsons do a wonderful job as the leads with also Jennifer Lopez and Steve Martin playing great supporting characters. All and all it's a good movie to see with the whole family. Also it's amazing to finally see a woman of color be the lead character in a dream works movie. Please don't give this movie a pass for it tells a great story of how two completely different characters from two different worlds seem to not fit in where they are from but somehow they both find friendship with each other. It's a great story about trying to find your place and somewhere where you feel at home. Hope everyone watches it and enjoys it as much as I did! (:
11,Home,1,12 June 2015,Such a bad movie that the review doesn't deserve a clever title,"What baffles me more than the movie itself is the fact that there are so many ten star reviews of it on this website. Do you people like watching crap? Do you enjoy having your soul ripped from your body, mangled, then shoved back in? Are you all mad?This movie isn't the kind of blatantly bad movie that you walk out of snickering to your friends about. This is a new kind of bad; one that I have never encountered before. There is something so sinister, so manipulative about the way this story was executed that I left the theater confused and horrified.The movie starts of with our main character, Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory, talking in stupid grammar. Then he meets Rihanna, who is even worse at voice acting than he is. Badger from Breaking Bad is also in there somewhere. Steve Martin also joins this baffling cast, sporting a disturbing mustache. While the latter two did a good job with the awful lines they had to read, our two main protagonists, Sheldon and Rihanna, could not read lines naturally to save their lives.The plot was really strange; easy to follow, but strange. There was definitely something wrong with the editing, and I wouldn't be surprised if the editor wasn't even fully conscious when he was cutting and pasting the scenes together. The pacing was all over the place. The movie felt like it ended three times before it actually ended. The action scenes had no tension. The emotional scenes came out of nowhere and confused me with their weight. The jokes were forced and felt flat on their faces.The biggest and most glaring problem with this movie is the music. When they weren't playing EVERY RIHANNA SONG EVER, the movie treats us to the worst orchestral score I have ever heard in my life. Every time a song played, it felt inappropriate. The action scenes were either accompanied by bafflingly quiet Dubstep, or strangely quiet orchestral music. Every time an action scene started, the music got quieter. You don't DO that! Did the aliens IN the movie make this movie??There are so many things I want to say about the movie, so many questions about WHO made these creative decisions and WHY they are still allowed to roam freely on this earth. This was just abysmal! It's terrible! There are very small fleeting moments of genuine emotional weight, and there are a few slightly clever lines, but it's all wrapped up in a flurry of terrible jokes, and terrible music, and terrible voice acting that it's CONFUSINGLY bad. I wanted to like the main characters, I really did! And there were moments when I did feel genuine sympathy for them, only for all that sympathy to fly out the window and into space because the editor quickly cuts to a completely different scene with a very different emotional feel to it. Or a terrible Rihanna song starts playing and ruins the mood. The one good thing about the movie is the animation. I enjoyed the effect of the aliens' skin color changing based on their emotions. I liked the design of the ""evil"" aliens, for the most part. The main character girl's hair was very well rendered. The movie looked beautiful, just like a turd looks beautiful when you polish it.Overall, this movie is an absolute train wreck. It's kind of funny how Rihanna voices one of the main characters, and most of her music is featured in--WAIT A SECOND. BACK UP. BEEP BEEP BEEPRihanna plays one of the main characters and her music is featured prominently in the movie. HMMMMMMMMMMM SEEMS A BIT OF A STRANGE COINCIDENCE, DOESN'T IT???!!I digress. This is a bad movie. One out of ten, would never watch it again."
12,Home,6,27 March 2015,Generic and Uninspired. HOME delivers a haunting message but falls short of Contagious Humor,"There are several lingering messages that HOME intends to deliver, and the speakers are aimed toward the younger ears: conquer your fears, be yourself, and as the soundtrack says ""Feel the light"" and bring it all back, pertaining to the lost glory waiting to be reclaimed, and the HOME they eventually, should be going back to.It will be difficult to dismiss HOME's charm, specifically the colorful bubbly aliens called Boov, and equally endearing human characters, most of which voiced by popular actors like Jim Parsons, Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez. However, I'll be frankthere's really nothing else so special about the movie. The plot is generic, I mean we've seen these alien-invades-earth, extraterrestrial befriends-human formula, over and over again, and it's kind of tiring already. I almost don't care about the plot anymore. Worse, in HOME, the humour didn't feel natural, either. I had these many moments when I needed to pause and ask myself ""was that supposed to be funny?"" while realizing the confused laughter gathering volume around me inside the theater. I just find everything the writers seemingly thought to be funny, aren't really as funny as they seem to imply. HOME is a colorful movie, I mean literally colorful, and you may find some of the characters lovable, but that's all. In general, HOME is a generic movie with flawed storyline, just another version of what we've already seen from its genre, only forced and unnatural and yields a mostly unpleasant outcome, bereft of contagious humor it utterly needs to overshadow its overly familiar material.If it's any consolation, the movie has beaufiful soundtrack.Anyway, you wouldn't blame the kids for finding this wonderful movie, it's for them after all. And this will serve as a reminder about how they should be and should act like while growing up."
13,Home,3,18 June 2015,Daft storyline,"Dear, oh dear. I was expecting more from the studio which has brought us fantastic and hilarious films like Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon. This film ain't in the same ballpark.The storyline is plain silly. Aliens who invade Earth and relocate all the humans to a new city (which the aliens build) so that the aliens can live in the humans' old cities? A largely unseen villain driving a planet crunching machine, who, it turns out, is a puffy starfish who just wants his babies back? Earth's famous landmarks floating in bubbles ... why? Transporter bubbles which make holes in buildings?The script is lazy, too: I really dislike having a narrated segment at the start of a movie ... can you imagine a 007 film starting that way? The characters are weak, there are too few of them, and they are just not funny ... the visual 'humour' consists mostly of chameleon- like skin colour changes.However, the kids seemed to like it, and the themes were okay. A few memorable jokes and lines saved it from being a total loss."
14,Home,10,19 March 2015,Amazing!!,"I was fortunate enough to see a early screening of ""Home"" and I was completely shocked. GREAT MOVIE WITH A GREAT MESSAGE!! Take your kids to go see it and even adults could enjoy it. Rihanna's debut in a children's movie was amazing and will shock viewers, along with Jim Parsons. They are two truly amazing actors along with Jennifer Lopez and Steve Martin. They couldn't have picked a better cast,message, plot, everything was just perfect. ""Home""comes out worldwide everywhere on March 27th. Once again, this movie is perfect for not just kids but for all ages. Some of Dreamworks best work, not to mention this is their first movie with an African American lead character. GO SEE HOME MARCH 27TH EVERYWHERE!!!!!"
15,Home,10,19 March 2015,Brilliant!,"I went to see a preview of Home at the weekend and it was excellent!Dreamworks' casting of Jim Parsons and Rihanna worked exceptionally well. The two roles they played had a great chemistry, proving how well both stars worked within their roles.The film exposed how well Rihanna coped with voice acting. Not only was she able to carry the humour contained throughout the movie, but she was also able to convey emotion through a particular vulnerability in her voice, which made Home even more of a pleasure to go and see. She also contributed to the movie's soundtrack, with many of her songs playing during the film.As expected from Parsons' character, he was as funny as expected and really brought forward the quirkiness of the alien species invading Earth.Full of laughter, Home had elements of a lot of genres, including sci-fi, action, adventure and, of course, comedy.I recommend Home to anyone who wants to go out and have a great time."
16,Home,2,14 June 2015,Remind me again why this film was so great?,"I didn't like this movie at all. The music selection was complete junk, seriously its like they took someone's album and just used all the songs on it. Some of the songs don't even seem to fit together with the scenes. Also this is supposed to be a kids movie but I can remember a scene where they say ""Jokingly"" say the internet never lies. If your a child, your gonna believe that unless a parent steps in and says hey thats not true. But lets be honest here, 95% of parents are junk these days. Most people with children had them young and are really the type of people who never should have kids to begin with.Honestly there were a couple other spots where I was kind of struck that they thought it would be a good idea to put certain things in a movie.I've seen many, many movies and I can tell when it seems like it was rushed and sort of thrown all together just to make a film. This movie fits that description. When the movie was about half way done, it made me feel really bad like nails on a chalkboard.Is it worth a watch? Meh, maybe once if you can forget about a few parts. Other than that, junk."
17,Home,9,1 April 2015,"Cute, frothy kids movie","This was one of those kids movies that moved along at an entertaining pace and kept the adults interested as well. The humor is generally light but consistent and the soundtrack to this film was actually pretty cool too (Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez, providing voices to two of the characters, sing some of the danceable tunes on the soundtrack). Jim Parsons is great as Oh, the misfit alien who just wants to make friends but comes up short in the ranks of his regimented, antisocial species. Steve Martin also lends his voice as the hilarious but clueless leader of Oh's people, who decide Earth looks like a nice place to live, despite the little fact that it already has a native population (us). The forced relocation of the human population to ""happy human towns"" results in Tip (Rihanna) going on a quest to find her lost mom (Lopez) is the gist of this sweetly funny movie and it's worth seeing, kids and adults alike."
18,Home,10,19 March 2015,Best Dreamworks Movie Yet,"Iam a big fan of Dreamworks movie and this movie has really raised the bar for any other movies in the future. I wasn't expecting such a quality performance coming from the likes of a musical artist like Rihanna but she really impressed. Although I seen a early link I will definitely be seeing Home in theaters March 27th. Be prepared to be surprised like me ,A father of 2 when this movie hits theaters. I watched earlier to see if it was suitable for my kids and if I thought they might enjoy it. This movie will teach them valuable lessons that took me a while to comprehend as a child. Its great that movies can teach our kids nowadays and this movie is definitely a classic already."
19,Home,8,23 March 2015,Great Movie,"This is as simple as genial movie for all the family. Its impossible don't remember Alf or ET, mostly Alf for the laugh, its a great comedy whit very good moments to remember and enjoy forever. I really like the main character, and the cats!! At the end of the movie the people claps.. And me too! The 3 d is simple and and perfect for me (the best scenes are when the cats walk trough the city! And the Eiffel moments). The girl is lovely, and the chats, the dialogs between them are very attractive to keep. The kids love them and mostly all kind of people too. The music is OK... Not the best for me, but its OK. And of course, the second parts it will be coming soon!"
20,Home,6,22 March 2015,So-so,"Children will definitely like ""Home"" but I can't say the same about the parents and other adults watching it. The films lacks coherence, if you will, but hey, if it can get the kids smiling and laughing and having a good time, then who are we to heavily criticize it. We'd only judge it more if it didn't do what it was supposed to for kids and families.Jim Parsons voices a lovable misfit alien named Oh, his fellow Boovians don't want to befriend him because Oh is odd and he wants to have a party when other Boovians would rather do what Boovians do best, running away, just like their leader Captain Smek (Steve Martin) who thinks highly of himself. Rihanna voices Tip whose mother Lucy (Jennifer Lopez) gets relocated with other humans to some other place when the Boov invades planet earth. Tip is determined to find and reunite with her mother. These two characters bump into each other and they form an unlikely friendship through a series of comic adventures. Oh learns what it means to be human and Tip comes to understand Oh's loneliness.Adorable and upbeat are some of the words come to mind to describe HOME. Adorable because obviously Dreamworks Animation has created once again a series of characters, in these Boovians, that can work as huggable doll merchandises to sell to kids. Oh is so much fun to watch, when he hears a song, his body can't help but dance to the beat and the tunes, he wants to reject it but his body doesn't and that serves for a comical sequence. That also leads to upbeat, being that although this is not a movie musical, it's driven by Rihanna's much, in fact if I didn't know any better, I thought HOME was a huge celebration of Rihanna. If you are her fan, you've come to the right movie, I guarantee you that.It's both Jim Parsons and Rihanna's first rodeo in the world of animated feature film, Parsons' Oh in particular is strikingly different from his Parsons' iconic alter ego, Sheldon Cooper in ""The Big Bang Theory."" Sheldon knows it all and he'll tell it to your face, whereas Oh only knows what he's been told by Captain Smek and other Boovians. Rihanna sounds too grown up to voice a little kid like Tip, I think Rihanna did all right, but she's got a long way to go, her timing and reactions are not quite there yet. HOME will teach our little young ones about friendship, family, never giving up, and befriending those who may be different from us Read more at Ramascreen.Com"
21,Home,,3 April 2015,Kids Movie Fluff,"Home is one of the most standard family films you'd get, in spite of its likable character designs, colorful visuals and intriguing premise. The film doesn't seem to offer beyond those dazzling spectacles and unending comedic antics. While that's not a terrible thing, the overall film feels more of a distraction for children to see in cinema. There is a totally appealing world built here and there is a theme hidden somewhere, but Home rather just conforms to the typical style of CGI kids movies today that follows the fast paced energetic set of punchlines and action until it finally decided to reveal what the whole story is all about. The overall film is undeniably adorable, but we've come to love animated movies even better than this generic quality.It all sets in a friendly invasion by an alien race that is hiding from an enemy, since they are new in planet Earth, they don't exactly understand enough of the world thus they have to humorously misuse most of its objects, having a hard time using their language, and make a mess around every place, usually landmarks. The main character, Oh, then meets a young human girl who at first hated these aliens for capturing her mother after separating every human to an isolated civilization, but slowly earns trust after befriending with Oh. The center here seems to be about avoiding naivety and misjudgments or something. The ending also seems like it has this same sentiment, but the plot doesn't do much to build that up pretty well. Sure, most of it takes place in a car with the two heroes talking and learning each other's culture, mainly treated as a gag, but the narrative feels so uncertain, we're just stuck with these two fooling around and getting involve with more trouble until the film decided to jump into its third act. Like everything happens so randomly.It's full of energy, but at the same time it sort of feels lazy. The story contains some interesting ideas and themes that could transcend itself from its first impression, but the film rather prioritizes the most common choices to absolutely keep the children's attention, which are the ones that don't necessarily help making the storytelling compelling. It may have ended with a heartwarming message, but everything else is so drowned with sudden action and humor, and so little inspiration is left to the audience. But the animation is cute, it's definitely designed that way. Everything looks so whimsical; what could have been a disastrous alien invasion, rather makes the world look like some sort of an amusement park. And how the characters look is so cartoony that this studio might earn another memorable character. Too bad, those designs only go that far. The vocal performances are delightful enough to bring them to life.Home needs more tweaks, mostly in its own plot. So much potential surrounding in its world, the movie rather focuses on what the mass would usually get in these animated movies. It may be delightful, there is some creativity in its visuals and it's easy to like these characters and the enthusiasm behind their voices, but it's also forgettable, due to its really uninspired storytelling. It's like they just threw everything together and sat around, letting the cuteness and random sentiments do the talking, but they somehow forget how it works, or just lacks the care it deserves. But whatever, just like what I said, this is perfect to distract the children, but this won't end up being a classic or anything."
22,Home,1,12 June 2015,Only sat through it because my sister wanted to see it.,"My little sister begged me to take her to see this film when it was on at our local cinema, so after hours of saying no and her persistent asking I finally excepted. I really didn't want to see this film as I'm not a big fan of Dreamwork's animated movies, or most animated films in general, and I find Jim Parsons to be so intolerably annoying.From the opening narration I knew it was going to be bad and throughout the movie everyone else in the theater, parents of other children include, seemed to love the film and laugh at nearly all the jokes. By the time I thought the film was over we still had around 30 minutes left and by the end I rushed my sister out of the cinema before we could even see the 3rd credit. Other people may like this film but it wasn't my cup of tea. If your a parent I'm sure your younger child of around (1-9) will probably love it."
23,Home,3,16 June 2015,"Really, really stupid!","'HOME': One and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new hit computer-animated kids flick, from DreamWorks Animation; about an alien outsider, who's become a fugitive with his people, that befriends a young girl, on a mission to find her mom. It was directed by Tim Johnson (who also directed the hit animated films 'ANTZ' and 'OVER THE HEDGE') and written by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember. It's based on a 2007 children's book, titled 'The True Meaning of Smekday', by Adam Rex. The film stars the voice talents of Jim Parsons, Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez and Steve Martin. I can see why this movie might be entertaining, for small children, but it's also really, really stupid!An alien race, called the Boov, invades planet Earth and takes over all our homes; while relocating all the humans to other, isolated, areas. An unpopular Boov, named Oh (Parsons), decides to invite all the other aliens to his new apartment, for a party. He accidentally invites every alien in the galaxy, including the Boov's enemy; the Gorg. His people want to 'erase him' for this, and many other mistakes, and Oh becomes a fugitive on the run. While fleeing, he runs into a young girl, named Tip (Rihanna). Tip is desperately looking for her mother (Lopez); who she was separated from during the invasion. Tip and Oh decide to reluctantly team together.The movie is filled with silly jokes and bad animation. The alien, Oh, also speaks really bad English; for some painfully annoying reason. I didn't find the movie funny, or entertaining, at all. But I'm also not a four-year-old little kid. I guess movies like this are fine, for really young children; but I think the filmmakers should put a little more effort into making something with more substance, and entertainment value, for everyone.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/uINe8REiZw0"
24,Home,,21 May 2015,When's the last time you had to walk out of a movie? This was it for me.,"DISCLAIMER: I love animations, I love kids movies. I saw this with my wife to see if it would be fun for our kids.We made it through 5 minutes and were groaning.After ten minutes I wanted to be anywhere else.After that we walked out.That's not something I do a lot - hardly ever.It's one of those movies that had a not awful premise but no soul and painful to endure.I'd even skip it on TV.Everyone is better off just rewatching Monsters Inc. imho."
25,Home,10,19 March 2015,Brilliant,Watched This On Mothers Day In The Uk With My Friend Thought It Was Brilliant Really Funny And Definitely Would Recommend To Watch. A Proper Family Film Kids Would Love It. You Will Laugh Throughout And Maybe Cry At Some Points It's An Amazing Movie Which I Believe Everyone Will Love DreamWorks Did Great With This And Also Rihanna Jim Parson And Steve Martin Embodied Their Character In Their Voices. Also Got To Hear Some Snippets Of Great Music From Rihanna Jennifer Lopez And Many Other Brilliant Artist. A Great StoryLine And Funny Jokes Throughout.Rihanna Jim Parsons And Steve Martin Did Amazing With Their Voices And Different Changes To Represent Happy Sad And Funny. Go Watch!!!
26,Home,6,27 March 2015,A Rihanna Commercial,"Part of the joy of an animation film is to escape into a new world with hope that you can forget about everything in the real world for an hour and a half. The problem with Home is not it's world building, but the constant Rihanna songs that unnecessarily play throughout the film. Besides some annoying characters and too many songs, there's a touching and cute story underneath. It's a film that had a lot of potential but didn't quite execute it well enough.The film was produced by the same people who brought us The Croods and How to Train Your Dragon so I hoped that this would bring the same level of joy and heart that those films did. Unfortunately Home succeeds only sometimes. The story of a girl finding her mother and having a likable creature to tag along with her is a great story on the outside but it didn't work out like that. Jim Parsons can be hilarious, but the combination of his semi annoying voice with the incorrect grammar made for one irritating character. Don't get me wrong there were great moments with Oh and Tip on their road trip, but I just wish it was executed better. The first 45 minutes or so are pretty uneventful and drag quite a bit. By the time you get to the last 20 minutes, which is by far the best part of the film, you feel pretty fatigued with the world.Like I said, there's a lot to like with the story underneath all the unnecessary pop songs and out of place dub-step music. I just hoped for more considering the people involved. I don't have any problem with Rihanna as the voice of Tip, but I wish she didn't have as much input with everything else in the film. It was just one big Rihanna commercial, especially considering they added in that the character is from Barbados, just happens to be where real life Rihanna is from.+Touching story underneath +The actual score -Not the redundant Rihanna songs -Drags, and without much focus 6.0/10"
27,Home,10,19 March 2015,"Home a very family friendly movie,with great characters","Home is a very family friendly film.you can take your small children to your teenagers to go see this film.its a fun movie that will have you laughing and crying at the same time. the music soundtrack is great and advise everyone to go and see it.Rihanna to me is the star of this movie for her first time being the leading role an animated film ,i think she turns out to do a very excellent job.Jim Parsons who we all know from the Hit Television show ""The Big Bang Theory"" is very likable and very clever in his delivery. Steve Martin who also is the movie does a very good job at selling the quote on quote ""Villain role""this movie is so good i would even say to go see it multiple time."
28,Home,2,11 July 2015,Watched it until the end... I must be a masochist...,"Did Rihanna pay for this movie? I'm pretty sure she must have... This is by far the worst Dreamworks movie I've ever seen. Terrible jokes, laim story... suited most definitely to 5 year olds and that's the only reason I gave it a 2 rather than a 1... From song to song this movie seems like an attempt to brainwash young children into enjoying Rihanna's (or J Lo's) sterile pop songs than to actually enjoy an animated movie, so if you like animation but already ride a bike with your training wheels off, you probably know better ways to spend 90 minutes of your life.... If you like Rihanna and J Lo or just like to watch multicolored cgi movies just for the sake of it, you might like ""Home"". If not, for goodness sake, please avoid watching this..."
29,Home,10,12 July 2015,This movie is great and I'm disgusted by these reviews,"First off I'm a 14 year old girl with more maternal instinct in my pinky than any of these other commenter's and as a girl who recently lost her 2 year old sister this movie hit home with the emotional points of family and its importance!Secondly in regards to another stupid review I believe the voice actors where great and the aliens awkward-ness was a comedic point not bad acting if you have seen Big Bang theory you would know the man who plays Oh is know for is great likeness of an awkward outcast which is Oh and Rihanna played tip perfectly for a girl who has seen bullies and is not from America. Continuing on with the plot it is one of the best for a child's movie considering that it is not meant to be taken seriously as a comedy and of course it is not perfect but no cartoon is! And this one took the time to tie up all plot holes its moral is great lesson for children as it touches down on bullying,family,and taking responsibility for yourself and actions and if you can not see that you are blinded by your hatred for the personal life's of some of these actors or your obsession with ripping apart any shred of light in this nasty society"
30,Home,10,19 March 2015,Incredible!,"watched this in London (thank god its out a week earlier than in the us) and its amazing!!!! really done something different with the animation and it's brought the characters to life. Soundtrack is incredible as well and you can definitely sense the amount of effort that was put into the film. So glad i had the chance to go to the premiere viewing! At first i was hesitant after watching the initial trailers thinking it would be very boring and unoriginal, but the plot is different to what has been done before! I'm glad Steve martin was on board too as his character is hilarious and my child loved it and his character. Also very relatable in an odd way. All in all this movie is definitely worth watching."
31,Home,7,22 March 2015,Charming.,"There's nothing particularly new or fancy about Dreamworks' latest animated affair. There are no breathtaking action sequences like in their How To Train Your Dragon and Kung-Fu Panda franchises. Nor is there the amount of laughs you'll find in their classics Megamind or, again, the Kung-Fu Panda films. Yet there's something so utterly sweet and innocent about Home that it zooms by with an enchanting charm. When people tell you to calm down by going to your happy place, it probably looks something like this. It's arguably the most child-centric movie Dreamworks have produced for a few years too. The adult-targeted humour is kept to a minimum and the physical comedy is amped up to levels that is normally irritating but here works an absolute treat. Its success can be attributed, in a big way, to the lovable alien Oh (Jim Parsons). A clumsy go-getter with endearing optimism, cuddly colour-changing looks, and amusing speech patterns, Oh steals the spotlight whenever he is on screen, which is about 95% of the time. As his plucky partner in adventure, Tip, Rihanna's precocious human child is fairly stock standard, whilst Steve Martin's dim-witted leader of Oh's Boov race lands a few hilarious moments among some dull ones. Vibrant, energetic and with an unexpected tear-jerking finale, Home falls on the right side of simple."
32,Home,7,27 March 2015,Satisfactory CGI animation for youngsters,"The Boov are a race of annoying idiot aliens who spend their time fleeing enemies: they are ""hiding"" in plain view on Earth, having taken over the cities following relocating all the humans in Australia, except teenage girl Tip. Oh is an even more annoying and idiotic Boov, to the extent that he is ostracised by his own people. He and Tip are thrown together and form an initially reluctant partnership to help each other: Tip is looking for her mother and Oh is trying to recall the cosmic email party invitation he sent which will let their enemy know where the Boov are hiding.This CGI animated movie is full of colour, action and humour, and colour is particularly well used. The two central characters, Oh and Tip, are nicely designed and well realised. The voice talent is good - Rihanna does well as Tip - and if I were to be critical, I would say that the individuality of Jim Parsons' voice does rather overpower Oh's personality at times.But this is good fun, especially for youngsters (who, after all, are the intended audience)."
33,Home,1,22 October 2016,"For shame, Dreamworks!","This is, without a doubt, the worst book movie ever. Not only that, but it has to be an adaptation of ""The True Meaning of Smekday"", one of my all-time favorite books. This movie takes all the emotional depth, clever humor, and creativity, and replaces it with endless pop music, a plot more 2-D than a Barney episode, and pop cultural references that were dated 2 weeks after this movie's release. Plus, the animation is so bright and gummy the characters look like Jell-O. The moment I saw the trailer for this film, I knew it was the worst book movie of all time. They were showing it at a school assembly, so I had to sit through it. While watching this film, I felt like someone was giving me the finger. I highly recommend The True Meaning of Smekday, but stay away from this pandering nightmare."
34,Home,1,24 September 2016,Maybe my last animated movie,"Rethink the watching. Horrible it is.The aliens in this movie use an awkward English syntax that feels almost like a genuine conversation with a non-native speaker, but it's not enough to make the characters seem real.Some of the animated motion is impressive and if this was the first animated movie, much could be forgiven as the physics of dust clouds and jiggles are very realistic. Still, emotionally it is very hollow.Time moves in near slow-motion so that you'll have time to wonder why you're still watching.The cat is cute but not enough to rescue this movie.Feels to me like a complete failure of the otherwise decent rating system of IMDb."
35,Home,5,27 November 2015,Nothing to write home about,"The ""home"" for the Boov, a race of cute, conformist extra- terrestrials, is actually our home, Earth, which they invade as a means of hiding from their arch-enemy, the Gorg. After transporting all the planet's human inhabitants safely to fun-filled communities in specified areas around the globe, the Boov are free to move in and take over what's left of the planet, replete with all the creature comforts left behind by the departed. Oh (Jim Parsons) is a bumbling, friendless alien - a self-described ""misfit"" among his peers - who becomes the target of a worldwide search after he inadvertently sends an e-mail invitation to the Gorg to come to his party. Tip (Rihanna) is a seventh-grade girl whose mother has been deported to the human colony, leaving her alone to fend for herself in this familiar world of unfamiliar faces. Despite their adversarial relationship, the two of them take a flying car to Paris, he to intercept the email before it can reach its destination, and she to find her mom. Steve Martin and Jennifer Lopez also contribute to the cast of voices. Directed by Tim Johnson, ""Home"" is a relatively undistinguished entry in an already overcrowded field of computer-animated feature films. Though fast-paced and energetic, the movie lacks the cutting- edge humor and imagination one finds in the best of the genre. Moreover, the grammatically incorrect dialogue uttered by the Boov quickly loses its novelty and just becomes irritating over time. There are edifying morals and life lessons galore for the kiddies to chew on, but, sorry to say, adults are likely to be bored silly through most of ""Home."""
36,Home,2,26 October 2015,A Dreadful DreamWorks Animation,"It's ironic really. In the past week I revisited the Star Wars franchise and thought I would never come across a more misjudged character than Jar Jar Binks in Episode I. But with Home, I have discovered some very strong competition.The Boov are on the run from their enemy the Gorg whom will stop at nothing to destroy every last one of them. Therefore the Boov decide to leave their planet and relocate to Earth where they believe it will be safe  at least they are happy. That is until Oh (an excruciating Jim Parsons) accidentally informs the Gorg of where his species are. Oh teams up with a young girl by the name of Tip (a bubbly Rihanna) to avoid the Gorg whilst finding Tip's mother who was presumable captured by the Boov.With a film like 'Home' it is best to list the positives first because there are not many of them. As predicted, from a high budget Animation Company 'Home' looks flawless with first class computer work and bright visuals to appeal to young viewers. But that is the only target audience for 'Home', the very young and that's the problem. There is no attempt at sly adult humour and in jokes. Just obvious gags that youngsters will find hilarious and any older audience member will not.The gags themselves are centered on Oh and his inability to speak legitimate and meaningful English. This grows tiresome quickly as there is only so much a human can take of this painful dialogue. Here's a sample if you are curious; ""You are driving me to the crazy"". Well with lines like this any sane person would lose their minds.It's not Home's blandness that's offensive but the fact that it always tries to promote Jennifer Lopez's songs in the film. I am led to believe that the only reason she participated was to include her new album. I did not think before I had seen this film that animation fit for children could be this cynical but there you have it. Home in the end does not feel well thought out and constructed. The plot is dire and leaves little room for fun and thought provocation. I'm not saying that all animated films should go by this basis but 'Wall-E' and 'Shrek' certainly did.Add these problems to an unending runtime and you are left with a film that is not just poor by DreamWorks standards but film in general. In the next few months everyone will have no memory of 'Home' so I guess that's something I should be thankful for.Despite great animation work and punchy visuals 'Home' relies far too much on dumb jokes, a simplistic plot and Oh the worst character in the history of Cinema since the infamous Jar Jar Binks of 1999. If this film is telling of what animation holds in store for us for the next year then lock your door and do not leave your home."
37,Home,4,13 September 2015,"Friendly, out-of-place alien befriends girl from Earth who searches for her mother as a result of the aliens taking over Earth in their attempt to hide form ""Gork"".","First ever Dreamworks production I have been disappointed to watch. It is definitely below average and their own, normally high, standard. Jim Parsons does a decent job at voicing ""Oh"", but Rihanna is just plain awful and her being a part of the film ruins the experience completely: she has no natural flow and it appears awkward. From the producers' point of view it would seem the obvious choice to let her do the music as well, but it fits horribly with the film and it comes off as loud, misplaced noise. (I'm normally a fan of her music!) The plot is boring as well and it seems very obvious the way it follows a certain model for these kinds of animated children's films.Overall a disappointing use of 90 good minutes :-("
38,Home,3,1 September 2015,Nope.,"This isn't a patch on the work by Pixar or Aardman.The graphical content/animation is done quite well, but the story line is poor, and uncomplicated. It's quite typical of cheap TV animation, and has none of the layers of storyline that are common in the Pixar and Aardman productions,Kids will like it well enough, I suppose, but there isn't much for grown ups, and the movie will soon fade into the list of forgotten kids movies. You won't be humming anything like Hakuna Matata, and your only ""I like to move it"" will be towards the exit. Nor do the Boov have the wide and eccentric appeal of the Minions, and although the Boov leader does have his moments as a character he doesn't have the memorable style of, say, the Madagascar Penguins.The whole thing seems to have been hastily written as a blatant vehicle for merchandising, product placement and a new set of songs from Rhianna.Ker-ching. So it's OK for sticking the kids somewhere out of the way for an afternoon towards the exasperated end of the school holidays, but then again, you could get a DVD of something much better for a lot less moolah!For grown ups, it's unfortunately quite a waste of an afternoon."
39,Home,5,29 March 2015,"OK movie, MANY BOGUS 10  scores!!!! Beware!","This was an OK animated movie - not a great story at all by any stretch, very predictable BUT the two lead characters were voiced well and were very appealing. Rihanna and Jim Parsons are carrying this movie for sure, which is a good thing.Now to the BOGUS ""10"" score reviews - check out how many USA reviewers gave this movie a ten score and have been members of IMDb for the EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF TIME - at the time of writing this I believe it was 1 week and 2 days for every single USA IMDb member review that gave it a ten and they NEVER reviewed any other IMDb movie at all - only this one - ooh spooky? Or ballot stuffing? you decide!This says to me that the studio got a whole load of their people to create accounts and log in here and ""big up"" the review score because they didn't think it was going to do so well by itself.Make sure when you're reading reviews they are from someone who has reviewed SOME OTHER TITLE and not just this one single movie as their first movie and they just joined a week ago.Bogus 10 scores to get parents to take their kids - very uncool! So, my review is, if you have a little extra cash and your kids are really bored, they will probably like this, just don't expect a Toy Story level movie, because if Pixar gets an A, then this gets a D+, maybe a C- at best because the script wasn't well developed at all.Congrats to Rihanna though, she did a great job!"
40,Home,5,27 March 2015,DreamWorks needs to find a more promising formula and soon,"While DreamWorks Animation is by no means in jeopardy of closing its doors, it's definitely not in the cushy place it once was, back in the middle of the 2000's. During that time, DreamWorks was exercising its ""Shrek"" franchise as much as they possibly could, in movie sequels, spinoffs, and merchandizing, while treading water with ""Madagascar,"" its latest money-maker. Since the turn of the new decade, those two franchises have run their course and, unlike Pixar, a studio that churns out winner after winner critically and financially, DreamWorks occasionally falters in both departments. After the mixed critical reactions and financial shortcomings of films like ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman,"" ""Rise of the Guardians,"" and ""Turbo,"" DreamWorks needs a winner now more than ever, and preferably a new entity they can build another long-term franchise around.DreamWorks' ""Home"" will not be that film. It's a film that DreamWorks could've made as a momentary diversion from catering to larger franchises. It's harmless, colorful fun, with a great sense of whimsy, but nothing more. Its inclusion of tired ""be yourself, be different"" morals, its infatuation with hope and optimism, and its abundance of Rihanna (not only is she a voice actress, but several of her songs are also included, making it feel like a vehicle for someone who doesn't need one) make the film difficult to see as anything more than a pre-game for what looks to be another Pixar masterwork come June with ""Inside Out,"" or even Illumination Entertainment's ""Minions."" The film begins with an alien race known as ""Boovs,"" lead by Captain Smek (voiced by Steve Martin), invading planet Earth, vacuuming up humans and sending them to Australia so the Boovs can take up a central portion of the planet. The Boovs foolishly believe they are doing the humans a favor, as they are a conforming, unquestioning squad of aliens that are easily mislead and don't do a great deal of questioning. One of the Boovs is Oh (Jim Parsons), a goofy, trouble-making, but well-meaning alien who winds up being banished from his species' newfound community after mistakenly notifying their enemies of their whereabouts. Oh winds up meeting Tip (Rihanna), a young girl, and her chubby cat named Pig, as she tries to track down her mother, who was separated from her in an attempt to avoid the large gravitational vacuum. Tip reluctantly allows Oh to help her find her mother, and the two strike up an amiable friendship as they both try to do what they can in a confusing, bad situation.Parsons' Oh character is an effortlessly likable one. He speaks in broken English, almost like Yoda, he's adorably naive, and he has received his name by his ""friends"" who groan and sigh whenever they see him enter a room. Parsons is an ideal voice for this character because of his ability to be obvious in his mannerisms and behavior yet all the more genial. Rihanna is another interesting choice for Tip, and shows that her voice acting abilities aren't as distracting as some other pop singers have proved. Their characters and the chemistry they create are the foundation for why ""Home"" is a bit better than it almost has a right to be.What soils ""Home""'s long-term impact is how ordinary the entire film is. There's nothing inside the film worth getting excited about, no real charm or magic in the film's plot, and its themes are destined to seem tired and worn in the eyes of most, even young children. They've heard the message that being different is okay and that having hope is something that makes us human from the ample amounts of PBS Kids programs they've been watching; they didn't need to go to the theater to be told the same thing in an unremarkable sense.To state how colorful and texturally vibrant ""Home"" is shouldn't be saying too much, as gorgeous, candy-colored animation has more or less become a standard in contemporary times. The benefits of ""Home,"" again, rest amongst the characters, who are charming to spend time with and are at their most engaging when we watch them interact with one another, be it Tip explaining to Oh what dancing is or Oh trying to decipher Pig's ""vibrating"" motions (his purring). These, again, are more or less forgettable attributes to a film that is unfortunately only brought down by the familiarity of its morals rather than lifted up. These next two years will be an interesting couple years for DreamWorks, who are either going to need to find a new franchise or get really good at giving us new stand-alone entities."
41,Home,7,24 July 2015,Just a good little animation movie,"Home is a good animation movie, nothing more and nothing less. It is not as horrible as some are making it out to be. It does start off slow but then it picks up and you start liking it. In the end it depends a lot on how much you like the 2 main characters and the music. I did like the characters enough to care about them. The music was just OK except one song which was great. Home is not what I would call a great movie though. You can't compare it to the likes of Beauty & the Beast, Lion King, Tangled, etc.My advice to anyone who is planning to watch Home is to be patient at the start and follow the interactions of the main characters closely. This is a movie about relationships. If you liked Frozen then chances are you will like Home."
42,Home,6,23 March 2015,It grows on you.,"From the start I was skeptical about viewing this movie, and to begin with I was not wrong.The pacing was erratic, the humor was cringe worthy at times and the characters were uninteresting. The dynamic between the two protagonists, Oh and Tip, becomes the main focus for the first half of the film however, most of the banter is almost inconsequential until the last half of the film.After the Paris scene, the story begins to pick up pace and the bond between Oh and Tip is tested constantly. This leads to a great final climactic scene that almost somewhat redeems the film. The first half of the film will provide nothing but some small laughs and a few touching moments, but the second half cranks up the dial and may lead many to a few teary eyed moments.Great movie for kids and adults, if you're willing to tough it through the first half.(Please understand that this is my first review. I hope to do more in the future, but right now i'm trying to work out a layout.)"
43,Home,1,25 May 2015,Great visuals but...,"The visuals are up there with the best and has amazing attention to detail the down side? They tell the story far too quick, and leave out a lot of very useful information. The comedy is weak and the voice acting is atrocious (Steve Martin was great). I gave this movie such a low score because they had major potential but did not use it, the instead decided to rush through it just rake in money. The soundtrack was boring, it sounded like a Rihanna album. If I were to have watched this in the theaters I would have been very disappointed. My daughter was yawning and nearly fell asleep. I only wish they would have taken more time on the script.."
44,Home,5,5 May 2015,Loses a star because of the shameful Rihanna soundtrack plug,"This is my first review for a very long time - can't even if I left one under this account before but the whitewash reviews on here are forcing me to do this.This movie is OK. Kids will enjoy it, you will get maybe a few laughs out of the whole thing. It's good for a matinée. Jim Parsons is being Sheldon Cooper so that's funny. The Boov's are hilarious. Story is simple and you can guess the plot from about 10 minutes in but that's OK.. It's all about the journey right? That's the plus points.The negative and (it's a real negative), is the awful soundtrack and the deliberate catering to Rihanna by changing the character's background to be the same as her's. It smacks of narcissism - not something you want your kids to be learning. The soundtrack liberally features ""hits"" from Rihanna's and J-Lo's catalog and honestly they stand out like a sore thumb. It's like they managed to get Dreamworks to contractually agree to use a certain number of songs in the film if they were to do the voice over.Someone at Dreamworks needs to be fired for this. Rihanna is not a box office draw. Look what happened when she was in Battleship. Jenifer Lopez isn't much better - ever since Out of Sight she's been so-so. There's lots of talent out there that deserves a shot at voice over work. You get the feeling a suit somewhere in that organization said let's either get Nicki Minaj or Rihanna to do the lead character and they picked Rihanna because at least she's human. Anyway I digress. Her voice work isn't bad it's just that they could have got someone better who didn't insist on poisoning the soundtrack with their work - same accusation can be leveled at Jenifer Lopez.The ONLY catchy song on the soundtrack was Red Balloon by Chali XCX. The most annoying thing on this movie's IMDb is the paid Rihanna / J-Lo bots plugging the soundtrack in the reviews as a positive. Come on guys, is it really worth taking the $2 you earn for writing the review to spread such misinformation?"
45,Home,10,19 March 2015,"The greatest movie for all audience, enjoyable and adorable","This movie is the most awesome cutesy family-friendly animated comedy for all audience, big and small. I like it a lot first of all because Rihanna is the voice of the main character. She created a concept album for this movie and so far it's flawless. It has 8 songs that will be played during the movie. The characters are so adorable and you'll fall in love with them instantly. Their bond is weird, funny and special. The movie does throw up some important lessons for children, which is always a good thing. And of course the Boov seem to know everything including human language and even emails, yet have no idea what objects like toilets or baseball bats are? You should definitely watch this movie, i give a rating 10 of 10. It's an enjoyable film with a positive message."
46,Home,3,21 March 2015,"Boring, unoriginal, unfunny, annoying","I'm baffled by some of the reviews on here saying this movie was ""amazing"". It was boring and pitifully unoriginal.My eldest daughter is 12, so I've seen a lot of this kind of movie, and ""Home"" was really nothing special; just another instantly forgettable generic plot that was stretched so thinly it was tragic. It reminded me a lot of ""The Croods"".We were in a huge cinema with kids of all ages and so many of the 'jokes' fell flat to absolutely no laughing whatsoever, I was looking around for the tumbleweed. At one point I heard a child behind me say out loud ""was that supposed to be funny?"" at the ""number three"" gag.The writers were obviously so pleased with themselves over one particular joke involving the name of a slushie that they kept repeating it over and over, desperately hoping for a laugh. It didn't get any that I heard."
47,Home,2,28 March 2015,Pure Garbage,"All Rihanna, all the time. Lost my attention within 5 minutes. If your a fan of Jim Parsons, just maybe you might want to take a chance on it. The alien is basically his character from Big Bang theory, but smaller and purpler. Or if your a Rihanna fan.....crickets...you might enjoy the soundtrack.The story is predictable, laughs are hard to come by and even the visuals/soundtrack were uninteresting.As a parent, I watch all the animated titles, and usually enjoy them right along with the kids. I have noticed a drop in quality over the past couple of years and with this lemon, I pray it doesn't get much worse.Save your money and read your kids a book instead."
48,Home,10,30 March 2015,"Heart-warming, funny, touching.","Though there may be a fair amount who agree that the movie 'Home' isn't as interesting for adult audiences, others could disagree. When I went to see it, all that could be heard was laughter and positive comments from the audience after it finished. It should not be labeled as 'not heart-warming,' 'jumpy' or 'annoying,' because what about those who actually did enjoy it? Articles are discarding parts of the film that made it... amazing to watch. It had encouraging and meaningful messages, that some reviewers obviously did not catch. The movie was filled with love and memorable characters. Honestly, who could dislike them?"
49,Home,10,30 March 2015,Great movie,"Great movie! the kids loved it, some people need to understand that this movie is made for kids. There's no need to look for the plot of the century in a film targeting a young audience. Going back to the movie, its everything I was expecting it to be. The kids loved it and are eager for the DVD release. Predictable maybe but that is what makes it good family movie, the lesson is something we all have to learn in life Great movie! the kids loved it, some people need to understand that this movie is made for kids.

50,Home,2,25 April 2015,Snooze fest even for kids,Took my grand daughters to see this movie and fifteen minutes after it started I wanted to get my money back. This was the worst children's movie I have even seen. I don't know who wrote this mess but it wasn't cute or funny; it was just annoying and predictable. I knew what was going to happen at the end. To me it was just one long colorful music video for Rihanna songs. The whole alien stuff was just a copycat of so many other movies. Yes it was pretty animation but if there's no engaging story or characters its just color on the screen. I wish that they had made the characters more life like and not so much cartoony. Or maybe the story was just bad. Too bad.
51,Home,9,25 March 2015,Superb,"I very rarely, if ever, post reviews of films, but having seen this today I really wanted to say how fantastic this film is.I have been waiting for this film for years, ever since I first heard about it. The trailer looked great, but I was a bit worried my expectations may be a bit high. Most of the critics' reviews seem to rank it as pretty mediocre, one for kids only, lacking in laughs, etc.I have to admit I was a little concerned at first: Home starts off pretty slowly (though the animation is fantastic throughout). But once it gets going there are plenty of laugh out loud jokes, and they are delivered brilliantly by Rihanna and Jim Parsons. Home gets better and better as it goes on, but I spent the whole film with a smile on my face and left the cinema in such a good mood.In addition it has a great soundtrack produced by (and primarily performed by) Rihanna.This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen and seems to have been really under-rated by the critics. I highly recommend it."
52,Home,10,22 March 2015,Amazing!,"Watched this today in the cinema and was impressed. Rihanna, Jim, Steve and Jennifer did a brilliant Job of voicing the characters. I would recommend this film to anyone as it is funny and meaningful at the same time. The music used for the film fits perfectly and is included on the soundtrack which is available on iTunes and the film is in cinemas. makes a great day out so i highly recommend watching it. The film is also in 2D and 3D so you can get a better experience of seeing the characters and feeling more connected. The movie is brilliant for kids and adults and has a lot of catchy songs included by artists such as Rihanna, JLO, Charli XCX and Kiezsa."
53,Home,10,22 March 2015,Great Movie!!,"I have seen Home Several times (I was lucky enough to see the work in progress before its completion). I can say without hesitation, that this is a great movie! The story and characters really came together well. It is funny, and above all, has heart. I just took my 4 year old son to see it for a final screening before its release next week, and he loved it. In fact, he was more excited about this than any other animated movie that we have seen in theaters. That is saying a lot, since we last saw Big Hero 6. It has a great adventure story, and is definitely fun for both adults and kids! The music works well too, so please go see HOME, you definitely wont be disappointed."
54,Home,4,30 March 2015,"This film was cute, but fell flat.","Home is the story about an eccentric citizen of a cowardly alien race (named Oh) and his interactions with a young girl (named Tip) who is trying to find her mother. This movie has very good intentions. Almost every movie designed for children has a moral lesson to teach and this is no exception. Home deals with being different, standing far outside of your stereotype, being brave in situations that seem like they will end in failure, the familial bond of a parent and their children, and coping with negative emotions like anger and sadness. I must applaud the introduction and overall concept of this film. It went to places and executed ideas that I was not expecting and was excited to see. The first twenty minutes of the film surprised me and made me want to know what was going to happen next. The alien technology was uniquely simplistic in its design and it was fun to see it all work. Unfortunately the film does not execute the plot or characters very well. This is not a family film; meaning only the children will enjoy it while the adults will probably not. The overall tones of the plot are cookie-cutter. A few scenes felt very forced like they needed some sad moment or heartfelt moment so they just threw one in there. Most of the jokes fell flat and relied on the aliens (known as the Boov) not knowing what earth objects are supposed to be. While it was kind of cute to see them eating footballs and wearing tires as headbands, it gets old fast. Most of the humor unfortunately just doesn't work. The characters are inconsistent in their motives and personalities. Tip spent a few weeks looking for her mother and still had hope that she will find her, but later in the movie when she believes she is in the same neighborhood as her mother she gives up after about five minutes. Tip and Oh initially stay together due to a mutual agreement but stay together later for no other reason than they need to stay together for the movie to continue. The voice acting was fine, but I have to talk about Jim Parson's performance as Oh. He is just playing the character of Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory, where the only difference is that Oh wants to make friends. There is nothing substantial added to the character to make him unique. There is also an odd use of music in this movie. At many moments, all sound will fade and be replaced by the soundtrack. This might not sound like much but it just felt like a music video instead of a movie. People will be crying and all of that will fade into a song that ruins the emotional weight of the scene. In the end, children might enjoy this movie, but parents will probably not. Nothing is consistent and scenes are set up just for a flat joke to arise or forced emotional moments to happen, but the pretty colors and silly aliens should keep very young children interested.P.S. I have received a lot of hate for critiquing child films so harshly. While it is true that children are easier to please than adults, it does not excuse flaws in their movies. That is what makes movies like the Lion King and How to Train Your Dragon so special. They have realistic characters with flaws and personalities and the plot flows seamlessly from one scene to the next. They are good movies that happen to portray content that is inoffensive enough for children to watch."
55,Home,1,12 April 2015,"Awful, to be avoided at all cost.","After reading the other glowing reviews on IMDb, there is little to no doubt that the other reviewers are either paid for their reviews or are somehow affiliated with this movie. It is Terrible!. Next to no plot, it comes across as something that was thrown together in a few hours and the screenplay in less time, The acting goes from flat to down right annoying, not even the kids found the jokes mildly amusing. This is as flat and forgettable as it comes, Even the animation comes across as cheap. Save your $$ and avoid this mess.I can see how anyone could find anything redeeming at all about it, Pure garbage! It is apparently based on a book, I won't be looking it up to see if a injustice to the source material has been done, I have never been compelled to write a review before, but If I can save someone from sitting through this garbage, then mission accomplished."
56,Home,10,29 March 2015,What an amazing animation film it was,"I was really looking forward to watch this movie because it's been a long time since I've last seen an animation movie.. and WOW! I was blown away! It was a witty and emotional movie and somehow was trying to bring tears into my eyes. It was an exceptional movie with voice overs from Jim Parsons Rihanna Jlo and Steve Martin and the characters where well implemented. I wish there was a 2D version at my movie station instead of a 3D, I'm not much of a 3D movie fan but overall it's a good movie for every age and family! I recommend it to every single kids around the world to go watch it because not only is it inspiring, it brings a message forward to what really is the most important things in our lives aside from every single thing we already may have!"
57,Home,10,28 March 2015,MUST SEE for your kids: a beautifully crafted film w/ a powerful message,"HOME was an excellent movie. Not only did it provide us with a powerful message, it featured THE first African American lead role in an animated film for dreamworks. That is great to finally see on the big screen. I don't want to spoil anything in particular but this is a film that everyone should give a chance. I will say the humor might be a little dry for our older generation but I can guarantee you'll still enjoy it as a whole! Moving on to the magnificent soundtrack executive produced by the beautiful Rihanna, the soundtrack is what makes this film so beautiful. Even the a couple of the songs explain that you can never give up on what you want and to never ""let the shadows find you"". Overall, give this movie a try. My kids LOVED it and so did I..enough to come make an account and spread the word ;)"
58,Home,7,24 March 2015,Billing,"The order of top billing in this movie supports my personal observation over the years. Namely, that no matter how famous & well-accomplished the ""Black"" person, they ALMOST ALWAYS take 2nd billing to the ""White"" person. Even in cases where the White person is LESS famous or accomplished. This includes everything from officially listed credits to press publicity. For example, music icon, Kanye West is always mentioned AFTER Kim Kardashian, although she's not know for having any discernible accomplishment. Or, In the New animated movie ""Home,"" voice lead & international star, Rihanna is mentioned AFTER her co-star & the less famous, Jim Parsons. These are just 2 current examples that pop to mind. But the list is extensive & pervasive. I can only explain this alarming discrepancy in billing as either conscious or subconscious racism. In either case, it's still bigotry on blatant display."
59,Home,4,28 March 2015,Predictable,"This is one of those movies you desperately want to fall in love with but you're disappointed they didn't give you enough to do that. It's kinda cute, not very funny, definitely predictable and well, sometimes boring.I question one of the casting choices too. I love Jim Parsons as Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory, but I thought actors changed the nuances and inflection of their voices to tailor it to a particular character. It was unsettling for me throughout the movie, because it felt like Sheldon Cooper was hiding somewhere nearby, lending his voice to the purple puppet on the screen. But maybe that's just me.To sum up, I think they could have done a lot better with the script."
60,Home,5,27 March 2015,I expected more from it.,"Just got home from seeing HOME in 3D. After reading a lot of the reviews here, I was expecting it to be much better than it was. It started slowly, and the characters and plot never really engaged my partner and me. I guess the best way to describe it is ""cute"".Oh was well-voiced by Jim Parsons, but the character got on my nerves after a while, like a persistently bratty child. The others in the cast were ciphers, nothing more. Even Steve Martin was wasted in his role.The animation was colorful and the 3D effects were unobtrusive, but there was nothing eye-popping about the 3D or the plot. In short, I was very disappointed. Several reviews reference Disney and Pixar as comparisons. I will too. Compared to most of those studios' releases, this film lacked soul and failed to touch my heart.I doubt that I'll be adding this film to my collection when it's released on video."
61,Home,10,21 March 2015,Best animation of this year so far,"This movie was amazing! Rihanna, Jim, Steve and JLo did a great job voicing the characters! I would really recommend this movie for children and adults. It's funny but it has a big meaning behind it, I think that's important for the kids to learn off it! I also think Rihanna and Jim did a great job for their first ever animation movie. ""Oh"" and ""Tip"" have a great chemistry in the movie. The animation itself was amazing! You have the feeling like you can almost touch the characters. Also the ""HOME Soundtrack"" is amazing, with catchy and sad songs from Rihanna, JLO, Keisza, Charli XCX and more! The soundtrack is now available on iTunes: http://t.co/TPrW0ncktn Rihanna has 2 songs on it ""Dancing In The Dark"" and ""As Real As You And Me"". My favorite song is ""Dancing In The Dark"", it's catchy and it makes me wanna shake my body!So don't hesitate to go and watch it! You'll absolutely LOVE IT!"
62,Home,10,31 March 2015,More than I expected. definitely worth seeing. who knows what others are talking about.,"I went into this movie actually expecting very little based on having seen the trailers. We weren't even entirely sure what the movie was about other than an alien and a little girl. However, it was date night with my fiancé and as I'm a fan of Big Bang Theory we decided we would give it a shot. We were very pleasantly surprised. We were in a large fairly full theater especially for a Sunday night. People responded to the jokes and the actions of the characters how you would expect. The playing with words and the consistency and playfulness of how the Boov speak just puts a smile on your face and makes you fall for the adorable characters. You also can't help tapping your foot to the soundtrack which worked very well to set the atmosphere throughout the entire movie. What really surprised me though was the adorable characters and everything that was used about them to build a consistent and well thought out story with a wonderful and moving message. While they fell flat in the trailers we had seen they were very lively and cute in the actual movie. They were a lot of fun and they made you feel for them. Especially Oh played by Jim Parsons. While different in many ways, in some ways it kind of reminded me of Lilo and Stitch. Especially the family message. Definitely a worthwhile movie to go see with or without kids."
63,Home,1,30 March 2015,I am curious just What Movie the 10ers actually saw!,"*** Spoilers may be interpreted as being Listed*** ""Home"" has the feel of a movie that had extensive trouble with the Scriptwriters, as in several quit and others tried to fix it and then they quit, etc. While the Animation was as expected from a DreamWorks Animation, I was very disappointed in the final result. Don't bother watching in 3D because except for a couple of the usual ""pointed Objects poking out of the screen"", the rest of the film WAS 2D, so much so that When I took off the glasses, there was no double vision! OK, Plot - Its a Girl and her Dog Movie, with Oh being the Dog! What is the Message of ""Home""? First, it is good to pick on someone different - Everybody does to Oh and nobody ever apologizes. Second, It's all about Family - Except the Boov don't have Family. Third, Bad Guys are only Bad because the Good Guys did something bad to them and the Bad Guys have a Heart of Gold. Which brings us to the Captain, Smeck - a real Dick who gets his just punishment but seems as happy as everyone else in the picture at the end. If all this sounds confusing, you have arrived at the message of this Movie - We don't know what we made, but spend your money anyway cause we need a Hit Movie this year!At the Theater where I watched this movie, there were few laughs from the kids, most seemed bored with the whole thing. Frankly, the adults were too! It's one thing to be bored watching an obviously Kids Movie with no hidden Adult Humor, but if there was supposed to be humor in this film, both the Kids and the Adults missed it! And the main Boov Plot being based on locating the Outcast Boov, Oh made no sense at all. The latest Trailer for ""Minions"" was shown before the running of ""Home"" and there were laughs from both Adults and Kids and then almost total silence through the playing of ""Home"". Don't bother going to see this mess and wait for the Discounted Rental once it is released on DVD. Or look for it in that $5 bin at WalMart for Christmas."
64,Home,6,28 March 2015,Enjoyable Family Fare,"I saw ""Home"", starring the voices of Jim Parsons-The Big Bang Theory_tv, Garden State, he was born in Houston, Tx; Rihanna-Annie_2014, Battleship; Steve Martin-The Pink Panther_2006, The Jerk, he was born in Waco, Tx and Jennifer Lopez-The Boy Next Door, In Living Color_tv.This animated movie is based on a book by Adam Rex called 'The True Meaning of Smekday'. It seems that there are 2 alien races that have been in a conflict with each other for quite some time, now; The Boov, a marshmallow looking friendly race of cowards that run at the hint of danger and the Gorg, a big scary looking race that want something that the Boov stole from them. Jim plays a Boov named 'Oh'-whenever other Boov see him coming, they usually say, 'Oh' in disgust. When the Boov make it to Earth-while trying to outrun the Gorg-they settle in and put humans in little concentration camps. Rihanna plays a 12 year old girl that gets separated from her mother, Jennifer, and meets Jim, who becomes her friend. Steve plays the captain of the Boov. There are lessons to be learned by Jim about humans, with being different and making mistakes on the top of the list. The Boov also change colors a lot, depending on their moods. Rihanna and Jennifer do perform songs in the soundtrack-more from Rihanna than Jennifer. I think the little kiddies should enjoy it. It's rated ""PG"" for some mild action and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes. It was enjoyable enough that I would probably buy it on DVD."
65,Home,10,28 March 2015,Sam,"well i must say that i really loved the movie, the animation was amazing and colorful and it's definitely one of the best animated movies i have ever seen. Rihanna as Tip and Jim as Oh did a wonderful wonderful job. Rihanna surprised me with how she was.I really enjoyed the movie. this movie is not even just for the kids. Tip's and Oh's friendship is actually everything.i will probably go watch it again and I suggest everyone to go watch it, you won't regret it, it's a cute movie with a nice message.oh yes, and the soundtrack fits the movie perfectly. i enjoyed the music."
66,Home,8,27 March 2015,"Home of the Adorable, Kid Friendly, Fun","When you think of Jim Parsons what comes to mind? Most likely it is Sheldon Cooper from Big Bang theory, as this character become one with the young actor. This weekend, Mr. Parsons has lent his voice talents to the latest animated movie entitled Home that is sure to be a delight for your young ones. This tale is about an alien named Oh (Jim Parsons), who is united with a human girl named Tip (Rihanna) while running from his people. What adventures will ensue in this latest computer generated quest? Read on to find out. If I had to sum up this movie in one word it would be adorable. Names like Oh, Tip, and Pig are just the surface of the theme of this movie. In what is sure to be the next wave of plush animals, Home contains colorful, cute characters with big eyes, adorable smiles, and cherubic designs. Little kids will love the explosion of rather bright colors in a world that looks very similar to something out of a Dr. Seuss book. Many in my audience loved the Boovs, the aliens essentially walking mood rings that changed from purple to various colors depending on their emotion at the time. Others loved the fat cat named Pig, whose curly tail and rotund form had little girls pining to own a ""Pig"" of their own, poor parents. Yet despite the adorable presentation, Home surprisingly has a good emotional spectrum spread in the short 94 minute run time. A majority of the movie is indeed silly fun, where Oh's childish antics and experimentation with Earth objects had both young and young at heart laughing. Eating urinal cakes, potty humor, and slapstick stumbles had everyone, including myself, laughing at the fun this movie was. For the more adult humor group, there aren't too many hidden jokes in this film (i.e. Shrek), but there are some clever puns and references in the tale that I think will get a chuckle out of you. Fun aside, Home also has a combination of happiness, sadness and love. Happiness is the dominant emotion of the movie, and the cast promotes a positive message of hope, kindness, and fun that kept me smiling. Those feelings were occasionally extinguished when the sadder moments hit. In particular when Oh was shunned by his society, despite his good intentions, I could feel my heart breaking at the relatable situations Oh and I share. Fortunately an awkward guy like m loved seeing he and Tip promoting friendship, and promoting the concepts of truth, loyalty, and kindness to have a successful friendship. Sure there were moments this tale got preachy, but the theatrical magic helped taper the cheesiness down, while still keeping the lesson. All of these great qualities would be nothing though without the voice acting to bring these digital characters to life. Parsons in particular steals the show, integrating Sheldon in both mannerisms and vocal context into Oh. The little alien has all the qualities of our physics genius, and brings plenty of the familiar laughs we fell in love with years ago. Rihanna on the other hand was okay. The songstress's voice sounded too out of place on a young girl. She didn't have Parsons' finesse and thus didn't bring the edge others brought to the movie. Oh well, they got some plot elements and a soundtrack from her involvement, the latter adding a little extra to the film.. As for Steve Martin, his voice fit well for an egotistical leader, and had a nice delivery to make me laugh, though his character's creative use of mundane objects was funnier. The final things to report are the animation and story. Home's design team did a great job with their work. Characters flowed, lights flashed in a sea of color, and the world was a beautiful, albeit cartoony, piece of work. The story though is very formulaic though, lacking little twist or surprise that I was hoping to see. The tale is definitely designed with kids in mind, and what little suspense that exists is not that thrilling, but more humorous. Home is a great family movie that I feel most audiences will enjoy. The cute characters, colorful world, and fun adventure are all elements I feel will rope your little ones in and the great animation will keep them locked on the screen. While the story is not the most engaging, and they rely heavily on Parsons to make the movie, Home is just a movie to have a good time with. I recommend catching this movie in theaters in the near future, especially for a family night out. My scores are: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5"
67,Home,10,24 March 2015,As real as you and me,"Well, this movie. I watched this, March 14th. Previews. The reason being, I am Rihanna Navy. And this factor being aside, the movie was amazing! The best animated movie I have ever seen. Before that? The incredibles. This actually created tears, made me laugh, sing and put my hands in the air like I just do not care! The cast is a very very strong one and makes it even better to watch! The soundtrack is another factor that adds to the bubble magic of the Boov world and makes you feel emotion. I love it! It is defiantly a must see! And the Boovs sure do give the minions a run for their bananas! So if you are with the family, on your own, with friends or are just obsessed with Rihanna like me, this movie will make you very happy!"
68,Home,6,7 April 2015,Great movie ruined by ...,"This was a fun movie, the kids enjoyed it, the wife mostly enjoyed it, I almost enjoyed it. Except for one thing. This otherwise fantastic movie was ruined by the worst soundtrack I've ever heard in a movie. I can only assume this otherwise wonderful movie was nearly completely destroyed by Rihanna's insistence that the studio pay for the rights to her entire catalog. There's no other explanation. The songs never seem to match with the movie.The soundtrack is vital to any movie. Don't think the soundtrack can make or break a movie? Watch Donnie Darko and imagine they replaced every song with some Rihanna track. Yeah, sacrilege. And that is what happens in this otherwise enjoyable family comedy.Seriously, this movie would be a strong 8 or 9 if they had a halfway decent soundtrack that matched in any way the action on screen.Jim Parson's Boov Death Song, however, was fantastic.If you love you some completely out of place pop music playing throughout the entire movie for no reason, then this is a perfect movie for you. I can only lament at what could have been if someone had the backbone to stand up and say, ""Not every song needs to be a Rihanna song! End the madness!"""
69,Home,2,28 March 2015,There was tears... Of boredom,"I don't remember the last time I was counting down the minutes till a movie was over. The theater is silent through the whole movie, no laughing, no excitement, ext. it was echoing my exact thoughts.I love Sheldon, but ugh it was over done. My husband, TBBT lover even started rolling his eyes, and the ""I comes into the outs now"" and how much the alien and Sheldon are the same roles.The same jokes, over and over, enough! The only part I enjoyed was pig, the cat.Other than that, one of the most boring movies I've been to in a long time."
70,Home,6,5 August 2015,"So much potential, not enough utilization","This movie seemed like it would be super entertaining and with some great characters. Especially Jim Parson's 'Oh'. He was an adorable alien with too much of a need for social acceptance, whose quest to invite all for a party backfires.Go back a little in the plot, and you find out that the Boov are aliens who want to settle on Earth (b/c you know when have aliens NOT wanted Earth). They relocated the humans. BUT alas, one human girl is left behind. Guess where she is from? Barbados. Guess where Rihanna is from? Barbados. What a coincidence.Anyways, i feel Dreamworks sorta took money to do so much blatant advertising for Rihanna. Like another reviewer noted, the girl protagonist (TIP), is voiced by Rihanna and listen to Rihanna songs on the radio. And the background music for some of scenes (including closing credits I think) are all, you guessed it, Rihanna songs! I do believe there may have been one Ariana Grande song snuck in there somewhere. ANYWAYS, the point being...it was annoying.The graphics were amazing and wonderfully made. The humans looked a little head heavy, but it's ridiculous to expect human proportions in a kids-animated movie. The humour was never LOL but more like a smirk here and there.This movie had many voice talents and could've used more character development, and less Transformers-like advertising. Overall, this movie is a one-time watch with little rewatching potential, except maybe to hear the infectious music of the Slushie car."
71,Home,2,30 March 2015,Home is not where the heart is (unless your under four),"The world of performing arts is just as punishing as it is rewarding. We've gotten the spiel on those that go to Hollywood to be rejected or end up working behind the scenes, but I want to refer to a problem that many face they become working actors; that their usually stuck within their medium. Very few can bounce back and forward, but it is usually the case for someone to find one set media form and stick to their knowledge. One may join up on a sitcom comedy yet find it difficult to become the next Broadway sensation or those in Film may try a talk show only to last a few episodes (guys like Chevy Chase for example). Part of the reason we don't see as many transitions from television to film is the usually reason; money. Studios are smart to stick with what works and keep their George Clooneys or their Angeline Jolies and not have to search high and low. The best chance for TV actors to make that change is to build up their popularity and really make themselves the talk of the town. This method has gotten Clooney from E.R., Katherine Heigl from Grey's Anatomy and Pratt from Parks & Recreation. Now let's see if Jim Parsons from The Big Bang Theory can make his transition from the latest from DreamWorks Animation, Home.The alien species, the Boov, are on the run from their enemy, the Gorg, and have set out to find a habitable new place to call home. They pick Earth under the guidance of their leader, Captain Smek (played by Steve Martin), decide that the humans are primitive and rather then get rid of them, relocate all of them to Australia while they take up the rest of the planet. The Boov take their new home quite nicely and try to make use of the former homes of the people.One such Boov, Oh (played by Jim Parsons) is more eager and free thinking the rest, vowing that his time on Earth will be his time to be popular. When a homecoming party he pulls off fails with no one showing up, he hits ""send to all"" on his e-vite, accidentally sending it to everyone in the universe including the Gorg. The Boov declare Oh a fugitive, but he manages to escape. Meanwhile, a teenage girl Tip (played by Rihanna) remained hidden from the massive relocation and hopes to find her mother Lucy (played by Jennifer Lopez). The two cross paths and Home becomes a buddy road trip movie.With the story set, can Jim Parsons carry a movie? I don't know as he basically played a similar character of his Sheldon Cooper persona from Big Bang. I guess there were some differences, though I saw mostly Parsons instead of an alien creature. So for now, the answer is no.DreamWorks Animation has really needed not just a hit, but a big hit as their last set of movies had not done that well in theaters. Home is the last kind of film they need. What could have been an interesting satire on modern human culture and conformist societies is pretty much a lazy and underdeveloped story about outcasts that we've seen many times before from DreamWorks. The explanations of the Boov coming to Earth are rushed and character development is barley visible as more focus is set of doing slapstick and toilet gags that are not funny. Even the animation, though with some creative ideas like Tip's floating car, seem more like a marketing ploy then something from a creative mind (rather then thinking of a cool looking alien, all I saw was a plush toy)I'll give this two Boovs out of ten. Home is a very pandering movie that has little appeal for the adult and will only serve as a distraction for little kids, and I mean toddlers maybe. So unless you're a few years or younger, Home is an absolute skip."
72,Home,3,29 March 2015,Forgettable and uninspiring,"I just read somewhere that Home is the only movie that Dreamworks is releasing this year. Think about that. The studio needed this movie. Execs at the studio green lighted this. And unfortunately for them, I don't think anyone will remember it after a month. Think Escape from Planet Earth, an equally dreadful aliens to earth animated snooze fest. We had intended to skip this entirely, but thanks to incessant previews on Nick, my 8 year old cashed in his ""good behavior"" reward on this movie. So we acquiesced. Even he was bored during the movie and showed more excitement after the movie to the previews shown prior. I could see what this movie was trying to do, but it didn't get far past the ""ok, so I'm thinking a misunderstood alien teams up with a sassy kid and her cat and go on adventures"" concept pitch. Sad really, given how fun Dragon 2 was. Also, slightly related, how far has Steve Martin fallen to consider his role in this mess?"
73,Home,1,8 July 2015,"Shame on you Dreamworks and writers. Bad bad bad, banking on TV characters to end up with such CRAP!","I would have given this movie a 0 but I love both Steve Martin and Jim Parsons. Sadly, Dreamworks and the screenplay writers Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember (the screen play writers) decided to make a film based on clichés and to bank on a cartoonized alien version of Jim Parson's character from The Big Bang television show (the series, I love). It was cheesy, predictable, annoying and boring. At some points I was not sure if the film was trying to make illusions about countries and peoples that are victimized who then victimize, invade and take over other countries and peoples. I do not think this was the intent of children's book author Adam Rex. His book appears to have received fairly good ratings, though I am doubtful about that especially after finding a short video clip this author used to enhance his book. Also, the quality of the animation was horrible. Shame to write and produce such crap. Flat and not worth watching."
74,Home,7,16 March 2015,A Pleasant  Surprise,"After the amazing epicness that is HTTYD2, Home looked funny but not as awesome. Then I saw the film, and came out smiling.It's no HTTYD or Shrek, and won't be a mega hit like them either. It's a sweet, funny children's film, with genuine heart and emotion.It tells the story of a little alien named Oh (Jim Parsons), who is a member of this alien race called the Boov. The Boov are a bunch of cowards who run away from trouble and don't believe in fun. Oh, while cowardly, wants to have a good time, and ends up getting into plenty of scrapes.In a mission to escape their enemy, the Gorg, the Boovs, led by Smek (Steve Martin)take over earth, placing all the humans in Australia - all except one. Oh accidentally sends a party invite to Gorg, which, if not deleted in time, will lead to him finding the Boov's new home and destroying it. Now a fugitive, Oh goes on the run with a young girl named Tip (Rihanna), and promises to help her find her mother, who was inadvertently abducted by Oh's kind.The opening twenty or so minutes are rather eye rollingly silly, but after that you get a quirky little adventure with a range of emotion and quite a few laughs. Some of the jokes are hit and miss, most are genuinely funny. The animation is beautiful in certain stand out ways; the cat, Pig, the Boov's skin colour changes due to their emotional state, and Tip's hair, among other things. It won't be nominated for awards, but it's still pretty.The voice acting is overall great; Parsons is as idiosyncratic and geeky here as he is as Sheldon on TBBT, Steve Martin is unfortunately the weakest link. What surprised me most, is Rihanna; I'm not a huge fan of hers (there's a few songs I like, including some in this film), but she blew me away with her talent here. I hope she gets more voice acting rolls in the future. This is one big name star with a lot of promise in this field.The morals are good; there is such a thing about being too positive or negative, you have to balance the two, take a chance and have some faith and hope. I learnt a thing or two from Home, you could too.Give it a chance, it may abduct your heart :) 7.5/10"
75,Home,7,7 July 2015,It is indeed recommended for you and your kids if you have any Or just for you if you're just a lonely Boov like me and you just love watching movies.,"One of the funniest Animation movies this year so far, The plot is vibrant and story is so fresh and funny, there are a lot of balanced comedy and of emotional scenes, the writers did a great job on the screenplay (worked before on Get Smart and Epic) with multi funny scenes and full of extrinsic and adventitious jokes. The events flowing smoothly in the movie and when you first think the troubles are over well it appears it still far from it.As a big bang theory fan, Casting Jim Parsons was kinda weirdly Adventurous but seeing the role itself needed a hesitant yet confident kinda snobby chatter voice like Sheldon Cooper, then you hear a lot of recognizable voices like Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez and Steve Martin a really highly paid cast ;)Overall, i loved watching it and it is indeed recommended for you and your kids if you have any or just you if you're just a lonely Boov like me and you just love watching movies. ;) enjoy it guys."
76,Home,5,8 June 2015,No wonder it's a mediocre movie,"As an animation movie this one seems to be caught in between the classic problem of targeting the smaller kids and incorporating so many concepts that those kids don't really grasp yet. There are concepts with varied depth that don't necessarily interest kids that small age such as the psychological burden of being alienated and the premise of having an alien invasion itself. It's quite a shame seeing that this movie has a lot of potential if it was exploited more. The character designs are new and unique. Yet the absence of real characters beside the five main characters really made this movie felt lonesome. Furthermore the production house just didn't do well in the marketing. With all those potential and the offline move on releasing the Boov toys, it's quite bad to see that this movie looked like it's only a lucky shot by the production house. Aside from Jim Parsons, the voice acting overall really needs major improvements. Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez really need to dive deeper into their characters and explore more on the characters' facial expressions and how loud their sound should be."
77,Home,10,29 March 2015,It's all about the kids,"One gage I use in judging an animated children's movie is how my 9 year old grand child reacts. Although, as many comments suggest, this was predictable...for adults, the fact is that my 9 year old grand child laughed throughout the movie, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would call that a success, because it's all about the children.I thought Jim Parsons was the perfect choice in his role.The 3d affects were not bad at all.The humor at times was also aimed at the adultsI recommend this to all with preteen children"
78,Home,,18 January 2016,Uninspired,"A group of cowardly aliens with superior technology invade Earth in order to hide from a much more sinister race of aliens, relocating every single living human to Australia. If that doesn't scream Dreamworks animated film to you, you haven't seen a lot of their films. As a little girl left behind tries to find her mother with the help of one of the boovs, the cowards, hijinks ensue, odd creatures are met, moral lessons are learned, all that good stuff.So yeah, the basic plot is actually pretty good. Lots of opportunities for cultural clashes, misunderstandings, comedic situations, surprising twists, and so on. Unfortunately the film doesn't take advantage of its premise, turning the whole movie into nothing more than an extended road trip and a very black-n-white message about getting along with all sorts of people despite their outer and first appearances. I mean, why relocate the humans? It would have been so much funnier if the boovs had simply started living in the cities. Perhaps on top of the roofs, needing constant open air or something. They would have gotten on the way of infrastructure, annoyed people, caused mayhem, all that good stuff. Now there's no cultural clash because the cultures are never allowed to meet. That's boring.On the technical side of things, I have no complaints. The animation quality is very nice, the character designs are nauseatingly colourful and cartoonish, but objectively fine, and the voice acting works okay. Though I do claim that it's extremely distracting having Sheldon Cooper's voice coming out of a bug-eyed alien. It just pulls me out of the immersion, but I think that's just me.All in all Home's biggest fault is its lack of ambition. It was clearly made to churn something out instead of making something because they had a story that absolutely needed to be told. Nothing in it is outright wrong, but neither is it very memorable."
79,Home,6,2 January 2016,pretty good,"The only con I have to really say about this movie is,All the Rihanna songs. It felt like every song on the soundtrack was one of hers. If you're a huge fan and never get tired of her, take it as a treat. Otherwise it is excessive. It'd be fine with a couple songs, and maybe one more playing on their TV or radio, but as the only music at all?The morals were very impressive. But somehow, in some very strange way, they felt miss-able, even though they were right there, highlighted. It may have been partly due to the movie feeling slightly detached. I'm not sure how else to put it. And... all the excessive distracting Rihanna. In important scenes I felt myself paying more attention to the fact that it was another one of her songs playing, again. Shes definitely not a bad artist, and I don't dislike her. Even if it was one of my favorite bands instead, I'd probably feel the same, hoping they play something else.The movie had a lot of highly creative elements, which I always appreciate in an animated film. Dreamsworks does a fine job with its characterization as always, even with Tip coming out with a character trait we all saw coming (every single movie has one.) The antagonists and lessons were great, how the characters treaded the planet's 'renovation' was fun to watch. The relationships and character growth was exceptionally well done.I'd give it a 6.5, but no decimals. It was there, yet it also wasn't? I'd still watch it again. Just takes a little push for this movie."
80,Home,6,9 December 2015,"Will not be a classic, but it does have a good message for the kids","This movie will distract the kids with the colorful CGI sequences and adult will buy into it because it seems to have a really good message for the kids to take in. I thoroughly enjoyed the message of this movie, which is about not abandoning friends and facing your problems head on instead of just constantly running away. About taking a chance and taking on new challenges. I thought in that regard the movie succeeded with it's message. However the rest of it, is very formulaic, straight by the numbers and easily forgettable. So the plot is about a alien race who's motto is to conform and just run away from problems invade earth in the most friendly way possible. But still try to take over it regardless. However one of the alien named ""Oh"" who becomes a fugitive on the run because of a misunderstanding befriends a human girl. However like I said, everything is straight by the numbers and very predictable. It didn't even have much clever or impactful moments. So everything becomes generic. It's one of those CGI films that will at least be a okay watch. But will not become a animated classic the family will continuously revisit or anything like that. I personally was bored with this one and felt like I was just sitting through it because of the message and since it's watchable at least.6/10"
81,Home,5,31 August 2015,Well...it could have been worse.,"Warning: The following contains spoilers, if you you haven't seen this movie you may want to before reading this review. Before Home, my least favorite DreamWorks animated film was Antz; while not a bad movie, it felt like an immature film for adults rather than a good movie for kids. Home is for kids, but not in a smart way; the jokes are kinda meh, the two main characters have their roles reversed and the story really flawed (like problems within the first 5 minutes flawed). So let's talk about the story; aliens called the Boov invade our world and conquer it easily...too easily. First off, where's our military? Why didn't we humans, who are naturally afraid of the unknown, fight to protect our planet? The story is really unrealistic and it gives kids the idea that if we were ever invaded, we wouldn't fight back (Independence Day this is not). Anyway, after the Boov invade our world, they male themselves at home and the film focuses on one Boov, Oh. He sends an invitation for a party he's hosting, but accidentally sent it to everyone in the galaxy, including the Boov's main adversary, the Gorg. Wanted by the Boov empire, Oh is now on the run to prevent from being arrested; along the way, he meets a girl named Gratuity ""Tip"" Tucci and her pet cat Pig, who are looking for her mother who like everyone else on Earth was relocated to Australia. I'm not making that up, the Boov literally placed all 7 billion people in the land down under. That makes no sense because while Australia is a big country, it's not big enough to hold every body on Earth. Not only that, but it's also not stable enough because most people aren't used to the warm climate nor are they used to seeing animals like kangaroos, echidnas, koalas, or wombats. Anyway, Oh agrees to help Tip find her Mom while at time, correct his mistake. To find Tip's Mom, they had to go to the Boov hub at the Eiffle Tower where not only do they find Tip's mother, but Oh kills his email before it reaches the Gorg. They then head to Australia, but it turns out the Gorg found the Boov and they go into battle. Oh leaves Tip, only to come back 5 minutes later and helps Tip reunite with her Mom. The reunion is short lived when the Gorg mothership arrives on Earth. They then realize the Gorg doesn't want to hurt anyone and only wants the stone the leader of the Boov, Captain Smek, took. After an anti- climatic climax, Oh gives the stone back to the Gorg, he leaves and they all have a party. Now that the story's out of the way, let's discuss the characters; now unlike most films, this has only 7 main characters and it's sort of a mixed bag. Oh (played by Jim Parsons from The Big Bang Theory) is our comedy relief who's the main character; the reason why this doesn't work is because he comes across as annoying rather then funny. That and he doesn't have that much character development, unlike Tip, whom this movie should have focused on. Tip (played by R&B singer, Rihanna) is a young girl who 's trying too find her Mom after they got separated during the invasion; she was a pet cat named Pig, but he doesn't do anything except act like a cat. Tip has the most character development and is more likable than Oh, but the movie doesn't focus on her and instead focuses on Oh. Let's talk about Tip's Mom, Lucy (played by another R&B singer and DreamWorks Animation veteran, Jennifer Lopez), despite being the macguffin to Tip's journey, the movie never gives us an insight on how she feels being separated from her daughter. I mean, she looks concerned, but I feel like the makes of this movie cut out a scene showing how she felt. Moving on, Kyle (played by Matt Jones) was supposed to arrest Oh, but after having enough of Captain Smek's idiocy, he becomes Oh's friend. Speaking of Smek (played by Steve Martin), he's really unlikable; he's a coward, a thief and a bully. How did this guy become captain of the Boov? Last but not least, the Gorg turns out not to be a bad guy, but an alien starfish that wanted his stone back because it held all his children. The humor really doesn't work; it's immature and dull, although Tip's lines were enjoy able. This movie's saving grace is the animation; the characters are designed really well and the flow is just so natural. I also like how the Boov change colors to express emotion; thoughts it's been done before, it's still really nice. Overall, it's harmless and appropriate for kids, but it suffers from a flawed story, and annoying main character and an unlikable antagonist. I recommend having your kids watch this while you're reading a book or something; your kids will have something to stare at and you'll have peace and quiet."
82,Home,10,28 March 2015,Amazing 5/5,"This is one of the most enjoyable Dreamworks movie I have ever witnessed in my time on this earth. The movie is amazing!!!! If you have children this is a must have!!! The plot is so creative and it was like every dreamworks movie smashed into one mega movie. It had incredible twists and turns. Critics are giving it bad reviews, probably because they AREN'T children. Remember, everybody this movie isn't aimed towards 45 year olds, so you people giving Grammy-criticized reviews are just plain stupid. Anyways, this movie is one that I always will remember and at the end it seems unknown if there will be a sequel or not, but the ending was significant, compared to current movies I have viewed lately. Anyways, overall this is a MUST-SEE for anybody with children, and for adults it is quite enjoyable too with voices like Jim Parsons, Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez! GO WATCH IT, IN THEATERS NOW!!!"
83,Home,4,6 March 2017,Just another generic kids movie.,"We have seen many movies in which kids have interact with extra terrestrials before. From E.T. to Lilo and Stitch, we have seen this been done before. ""Home"" is a movie that tries this formula, and fails. It wants to be a funny and smart animated movie and it turns out that the film is nether funny nor smart. It's the basic kids movie formula disguised as a DreamWorks movie and that boggles me. This was the studio that brought us great movies throughout the past decade, but sadly, this film surely ain't one of them.The film begins with a ""friendly invasion"" (as the movie puts it) of Earth by an alien species known as the Boov who are led by Captain Smek (Steve Martin). They have been chased from planet to planet by the Gorg, the Boov's enemy. The humans have been relocated so the Boov can move into their homes. One Boov named Oh (Jim Parsons) is trying to make friends with the Boov, but none of them seem to like him. He decides to throw a housewarming party and invites everybody he knows to his party, and I mean everyone. Everyone in the galaxy, including the Gorg. Oh is then a fugitive on the run, and later bumps into a fourteen year old girl named Gratuity Tucci who goes under the name Tip (Rihanna). She is the only one not to be abducted and relocated by the Boov and is searching for her mother who was abducted along with everyone else. So, the two of them go off on a journey to find Tip's mother and clear Oh's name.The film is based off the book ""The True Meaning of Smekday"" by Adam Rex and having not read the book, I don't know how much of the book was kept in the film or not, but that still doesn't excuse the film's poor story and characters. The story is about as cliché a kids movie you can get. It's not awful, but certainly not great. The characters are cut outs. We have seen all the characters before. The screw up that has a good heart, the girl who tries to be tough but has a soft side, the bully captain that has a giant ego. It's nothing new. The performances of the characters is what I'm split over the most about them. Jim Parsons' performance as Oh sometimes gets a laugh, but sometimes watching him I kept thinking of Sheldon from Big Bang Theory and wishing he would have funnier things to say. Tip is a really well written character. She is written like a proper fourteen year old girl, but Rihanna's performance is what sinks her chances of being a good character. Her performance as Tip is so bland and unemotional that I'm really surprised that she got cast in the role. The only character in my opinion that actually has something funny to say and has good delivery of the lines is Steve Martin as Smek. He steals every scene of the movie he was in and was actually pretty funny in his role, maybe because he was the only Boov that could talk normal. Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention. The Boov talk like that ""Can I has cheeseburger?"" meme throughout the whole movie and it gets really old fast. ""Home"" is a film that in my opinion is in the wrong studios hand. I kept thinking that this film should have been in another studios hands like Illumination or maybe even Disney. Maybe they could have made the film much funnier and smarter than what DreamWorks had turned out. I don't know and I guess I never will. I don't think it would be bad to show ""Home"" to kids, but personally, I would just show them Lilo and Stitch instead."
84,Home,4,15 January 2017,For small children,"Home, go home.Home has good animation, quirky characters, a very interracial movie, an original story, some funny moments (very few), and Rihanna and Steve Martin are quite natural and credible in their respective roles. A priori, the story has a good message: it tries to see the good things in humanity, speaks of what being a friend and being family feels like, and how important is keeping your word. I really liked that the Boovs change colour depending on their mood.However, the characters are poorly developed, the story is not engaging enough for adults, too many clichéd twists and turns, and then there is the dubbing. I love Jim Parsons, but he is not good as Oh because, as soon as Oh opens his mouth, we hear Sheldom Cooper from The Big Bang Theory with all his quirks and voice inflections, not Oh, so that ruined the movie for me from the very beginning. This movie would have been great, it had good things a priori, but it ended being something all right.This is an example of how a big production company can spend millions on animation to make a feature film and get nothing that will make you have a great time unless you are a small child, nothing that will make you lol, nothing that will touch your heart, nothing that will stay in your head for too long, nothing that will make you include the film in your fave list of animated films, and nothing that most animation lovers will find good or will be willing to see for a second time, even for free. I personally struggled keeping my attention when I first watched it."
85,Home,5,7 July 2016,You can never go Home again.  Never.,"Yes there are spoilers here. There are always spoilers here.It's a shame when you see a trailer and realize that everything you're seeing is the best of the movie. Sometimes you can't see that until you actually watch the movie, and sometimes you already know that what you see is all you're going to get.In the case of HOME, you get neither.Oh is an alien who is oblivious to Everything. He's part of the Boov race, a race of aliens that have decided to move in and take over Earth because They're universal cowards, running from a much more advanced adversary that is desperately trying to destroy them For some reason. Although, to be fair, considering how annoyingly stupid they are, there could be any number of reasons I'm digressing.The good in this movie is Jim Parsons. His voice acting and comedic timing are spot on, so watching Oh prance about and speak his one-liners is actually pretty enjoyable.The bad is the part where you realize, if you are like me, that your suspension of disbelief gets shot out the window when you notice that Rihanna is not only voicing Tip, who seems likable enough, but is also promoting her music. The scene in the (flying) car when she turns on (her own) music suddenly made me realize that Rihanna was doing Tip's voice.And promoting the soundtrack.This is not a good thing for a movie that barely had my attention in the first place. It destroyed the flow of the movie, and made me cringe as I watched the scene. See, suspension of disbelief is the very CORE of all visual art. What you see on the screen is fake, it's artificial, it's made up in such a way as to sweep you along for a ride that your brain, if it was looking at it from the outside, knows that it cannot be real. But we surrender it to fall into the story, to embrace the colors and the characters, to trick our brains into buying something that is, essentially, a collaboration of illusions.Done correctly, you buy it in WEIRD SCIENCE when Gary and Wyatt create Lisa with their puny 1980s computer software, because you WANT to.Shoving Rihanna's music in your face while Rihanna is driving the car makes you realize you're watching a fake light show. And worse, if you're like me, it makes you feel like you're watching a commercial.Nobody likes commercials. Nobody.What could have been awesome is the plot of the movie itself. The setup was strangely sinister, considering the soft, plushy Boov and their less-than sinister appearance. Relocating Earth's population and taking everything over without asking was a strange kind of surprise that had me intrigued. Tip's part in bumping into the oblivious Oh worked for me, as well. I cringed slightly at some parts, like the redesign of the car with Seven-Eleven fountain-works that of course made zero sense, but I swallowed it because of the type of movie I was watching. Rihanna's music ruined the flow of the movie, but I liked where it went after that, and I even liked the final delivery at the end.What was nauseating was Rihanna's music. She's always been, how shall I say, fond of sexuality, and to hear her music played in kid's movies wears a little on me. Even ""Shut Up and Drive"" in WRECK-IT RALPH had me cringing a bit, especially if you pay attention to the lyrics. Rihanna is the car, and she wants you to drive her. And she wants you to shut up while you do it. So to hear her music here, especially HOW it was done, was horrible.By itself, I have no problem with Rihanna. Or her taste in music. I just don't think it fit here. Or in any kid's movie, to be honest.Like THE BOOK OF ELI, this movie is a pile of wasted potential. It could have been magnificent, grandiose even. It was a pale, Seven-Eleven soft drink, wrapped in bright colors and filled with sugar to make you laugh.Until you realize you drink it too fast, and get a headache for your trouble."
86,Home,1,30 June 2016,Awful,"Actually it's more of a 0 out of 10. The movie was not as good as I expected it would be. The only thing I like about it is that the cast was really good. The film is so boring and predictable. And the worst thing about it that they just keep playing the same song for every scene. And the scene that is thought the most emotional in the whole film wasn't that emotional. It's just so predictable, They can still make the movie without that death scene, it doesn't need to be added in to the movie. Even if Oh did died, it still wasn't meaningful and i can't believe someone cried when watching that part. And I hate Tip, she's a bitch, Oh fixed her car and she didn't even thank him, she kicked him in the face while he was just trying to be nice to her. Also the jokes in this movie sucks and NOT FUNNY. I thought a movie made by Dreamworks would be cool so i'm very disappointed. Also, i hate that they used the same song in every scene of the movie. And we only need ONE emotional song for that ONE emotional moment Because the song was used before so when they used it again in THE emotional scene, I didn't feel sad or anything. So this is a failure.Again, I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE this movie"
87,Home,6,31 March 2016,"Did you notice that Rihanna was in this movie? Don't worry if you didn't, it was easy to miss, I know!","Rihanna, sorry  I mean Home, is a story of likable aliens who invade earth in order to hide from evil aliens. They relocate the entire human population to Australia, rehousing them in camps. (geographically impossible I know, but it's a kids film so just go with it). Oh (which is the name of the main Alien) has a reputation for being clumsy and stupid, he is ignored by his peers and when he makes a catastrophic error on earth, he goes on the run! Here, he bumps into Rihanna  sorry, Tip! Her name is Tip, not Rihanna. She is a teenage girl who has been left alone with her cat in the alien community as her mum got relocated to Australia. The pair bump into each other and partake on a worldwide road trip in a flying car to find her mother and also keep Oh from being discovered by his own kind.As is the case with most Animated movies, the story is simple and the humour is predominantly child orientated with some subtle adult references. The messages are less subtle but well intended all the same. It isn't a bad movie, I enjoyed myself while watching it I just didn't see it as anything special.It looks visually great with lots of vibrant colour and impressive settings. The main character 'Oh' is extremely likable, he's cute for the kids and also surprisingly witty for the older viewers. He changed colours on dependent on his mood, pulls some funny facial expressions and made me laugh many times. The story line is simple yet has enough about it to stand up for an hour and a half. Also, the overall message is a good one, mistakes are going to be made, by everyone, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing it's just a part of being human. As with nearly all kids movies, friendship, loyalty and courage are all at the forefront of this movie, despite that being very overdone, it does fit well with Home.Rihanna/Tip/Rihanna. The kid looks like what I would imagine a young Rihanna would look like, she's would by Rihanna and it is distinctly annoying how recognisable this is  she's screechy and unbearably annoying at times. The soundtrack is essentially a Rihanna CD, every opportunity possible we are forced to listen to one of her songs, often with the Rihanna character twerking with her pet cat  it got tiring. There were 5 Rihanna songs in this movie, say what you like, but you cannot argue that that is ludicrously excessive. I imagine they approached Rihanna to voice the role, to which she agreed but upon the conditions that the character must look like her and the entire soundtrack must be recorded by her. God knows why they agreed to this, but I doubt Rihanna minds, she must have made a fortune starring in her own personalised movie.Overall, Home is a pleasant enough kids movie, it doesn't have the wow factor I have gotten from other animated movies (Shrek, Ice Age, Pixar movies) but it does its job well enough and it was better than I expected. If you aren't as irritated as I am by the Rihanna love-in, you could well enjoy the movie more than I did.6/10"
88,Home,4,12 April 2015,Cute movie: with some flaws,"This was a cute movie, yes, but it had some flaws. I assume you know the plot already, but if you don't, read someone else's review and then come back here. I'll wait. Okay? Okay. I think the worst part of this film is the soundtrack and the voice acting. Jim parsons did a great job, but Rihanna was a bit shoddy. Also, the entire soundtrack was Rihanna, maybe a JLo song in there somewhere, but it was annoying and almost always out of context. There would be a sad scene with some hip Rihanna singing in the background. Hooray. Also, most of the jokes were kinda iffy, just getting a hmmph or nothing at all, leaving you to wonder if it was supposed to be funny. Some jokes (only one or two) were funny (the joke about the metric system), but they weren't as exaggerated as most of the other jokes in the film. Also, just from watching the trailer, you get almost nothing of the plot. And the ""my arms are in the air like I just do not care"" joke was REALLY exaggerated and nobody laughed because they had already laughed the first hundred times they saw the trailer. Overall: animation was on point, 10/10. Story: 5/10. Humor 3/10. Soundtrack 1/10. Actors 4/10. You can watch this film without being overly bored, but I wouldn't buy the Blu-Ray collectors edition diamond edition super fun pack after watching this in theaters."
89,Home,5,5 April 2015,"Boring, predictable and overused","Honestly I hated it. When I first saw the trailer, I was so confused about the plot.Went to the theaters with my little kiddy cousin, hoping for an enjoyable movie. Disappointed...Even my little 7 year old cousin was bored out of his mind.The jokes are based on the alien not acknowledging our human culture. And the same gag get so boring and repetitive. I have to admit I chuckled a few times but it was still dull.Rihanna's voice acting is as prosaic as the jokes. J'lo's voice acting was average for the 1 minute of screen time.During the movie I kept thinking of other movies like E.T or Lilo and Stiche, even Open Season. Why Open Season? It's because the plot of Open Season is based upon an outcasted character seeking for friends\family and a character seeking the mother figure. The plot is very predictable, so predictable, I nailed exactly the plot twist. Finally, kids might laugh a few times, adults and teenagers will check the time every 5 minutes to see when will this movie end..."
90,Home,5,1 April 2015,For Children 10 and Under,"""Oh, no! My hands are in the air like I just do not care!""DreamWorks' latest animated film will please the younger audience with its colorful visuals and likable characters, but I'm afraid parents won't be too entertained by the predictability of the story, neither kids above the age of 10 for that matter. That is unless you are a fan of Rihanna who voices one of the main characters and sings the entire soundtrack for the movie. Home introduces us to an alien race known as the Boov who are always fleeing from their enemies, the Gorg. They flee to new planets where they can hide from the Gorgs and their next destination is Earth. Under the leadership of their most respected coward, Captain Smek (voiced by Steve Martin) they relocate the humans to other parts of the planet believing they are an inferior race and install themselves all over the globe. Oh (Jim Parsons) is a Boov misfit who is desperately in need of a friend and when he accidentally sends a message across the universe to a welcoming home party he puts the lives of everyone at risk. Realizing that he has made a terrible mistake, Oh goes on the run and that is where he runs into Tip, a young human girl who has managed to escape from the Boov relocation. She is searching for her mother (Jennifer Lopez) and after befriending Oh the two realize they can help each other out on their quests and embark on a journey that will take them around the globe. The premise of the story isn't very original and we've seen this scenario played out many times in the past with films like Lilo & Stitch or ET. The concept of teaming up a young child with an unknown alien seems to be appealing to kids who might feel like everyone around them is an alien in some sort of way. It has worked in the past so the producers aren't really trying anything new here and they don't provide a fresh spin to the well known story either. Ten minutes into the film and you already know how everything is going to turn out in the end. There aren't any surprises and the only treat that Home offers are the colorful visuals and some few funny scenes. I didn't get to watch this film in English so I couldn't enjoy the voice work from Rihanna and Parsons, whom I'm a fan of his series, The Big Bang Theory. The Spanish voice work was solid and some of the jokes translated well. The film does have some heartwarming moments and seems to remind children of the importance of facing their fears and taking risks. Tip is an adventurous character who teaches Oh to have hope despite the odds. She also teaches him about the true meaning of friendship which is thinking and caring for others instead of oneself. The message is well intentioned although a bit light, but in the end the simplicity of the story will hurt the film's chances of remaining in the child's memory after a few days have passed. Young kids will be entertained, but parents might prefer to take a nap while their children watch the movie. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
91,Home,6,19 March 2015,At home anywhere,"Perfectly could adapt the title of my review of that expression after seeing this movie on film, I enjoyed but if the would have been at home I would not assume anything wrong simply because before analyzing Home'd say it's not a film to pay in the cinema without despise, do not get me wrong. Home has its virtues, funny and touching moments but no more than a peaceful, simple and correct film that does not take steps, no risks, shows good ideas, done that marginalize human and aliens dominate our planet in its own way it seems Original but once stereotypes appear, characters thousand times viewed and topical ends up being a conventional tape. No breaks The Croods emotionally and How to Train Your Dragon 2 and much less fun as Rise of the Guardians and Turbo by putting Recent examples of Dreamworks. It goes in the interesting line Peabody and Penguins, simple movies with your points but are be forgotten over time more than obvious manner. Tim Johnson redirects years after the great and undervalued Neighbors invaders from which other films have drunk it. Home serves as commercial vehicle for Rihanna to try to take off even more in the film that resists Jennifer Lopez that although this takes more Weather and movies. Your excess Music makes no more than that, a hybrid Monsters Inc., Monsters vs. Aliens and ET The alien who is friendly and charismatic character Oh, but not off so that you can get to remember more than anything because humor abounds especially for younger, not used a family mood which Gru and other films but sticks to what Preschool practically. Errors and holes because of a mounting confusing, let loose ends and licenses taken as to cover the other aliens because they are fugitives and when they want it camouflaged by side regardless of the surroundings. The band sound achieved success and characters are even seen a thousand times nice, the story is funny at times and there are beautiful moments so to speak but nothing more than an over the factory. I am generous with animated film because I tend to earn enough to a couple of smiles but I see that is going to take many blows therefore the public and critics and partly justified. You can have good ideas and not exploit them."
92,Home,,16 April 2015,Pixar-lite with yodaspeak,"Don't expect Pixar-like interactions or emotions, and if this is filler for you and your family until Pixar's 'Inside Out' releases later this year, it's not a bad thing to sit thru.With a plot that is pedestrian as it is predictable, what holds this together is the quality of animation, the 3D, and a few 'jokes' and life-lessons scattered throughout. It also gives Rhianna a chance to showcase her new tracks, and while her crooning is music to the ears, literally, it does smack of pandering to her fan-base, something actual movies should perhaps consciously avoid doing if they want us to empathize with their characters. Now, if you have indeed chosen to go that route, why cast Lopez in the voice of her mom, and not have them do a duet, have something like a Frozen-kinda vibe to it all? Seemed like a wasted mainstream opportunity, and that is surprise, since the purpose of all those writers' meetings is supposedly to milk out everything creative within the context of any plot. I guess there was far too many Dorito snooze-fests on, without getting a Red bull wake up call.There were a few things that appealed to me:+ The (literally) juiced-up car.+ The final truth about the bad guys. + Oh's attempts to fit in, being optimistic most of the time, which I worried was going to turn grating, fell just short of that.+ The art design of most of the cityscapes and the countrysides on Earth.+ The scale of the movie suddenly changing in-between. Might cause whiplash for some, though.I've covered the minuses, so I won't go into them again, but do feel sad about all the missed opportunities. Ah, there's also no explanation for why the Boov's speak the way they do, and a little more backstory for both leads would not have been a waste of runtime.All in all, definitely a decent watch for the entire family. Disposable, guilt-free entertainment."
93,Home,4,29 March 2015,"Strong Voice-Overs, But Premise Chews Much More Than It Can Swallow","Both 'Sheldon' and Rihanna did a good job with their respective characters. Unfortunately, the trailer for this move is a lot more promising and entertaining than the entire actual movie.Some of the jokes were actually good, but the ridiculous premise and the terribly bland and pointless soundtrack spoiled everything. Before the movie started, kids in the theatre were laughing loudly at the short preview for the Minions - the same enthusiastic bunch nary made more than a sympathetic giggle throughout the whole of Home, which tells you how poorly done the execution of the movie was.Having aliens (no matter how likably silly they are) take over the world and then slush off the entire human population to a desert commune in Australia, where they roam around in holiday garments like useless emotionless game avatars - just totally unfunny, pointless and lost on kids. The movie can't decide if it wants to be a nerdy serious sci-fi or a fun inspiring kid movie - it veers all over the place, and falls flat, throwing the audience into whatever-whoever uninspiring territories, where even good jokes go splat.By comparison, a good dose of The Jetsons would have been more fun."
94,Home,7,27 March 2015,Great Movie for the Kids,"I just watched this movie today with my 4-year-old daughter, and I thought it was a cute movie that carried a good meaning, such as the importance of family and friends. I did think the movie was going to be a bit funnier considering that Jim Parsons voiced Oh, but it was sweet and heartwarming. I did have my doubts about Rihanna voicing ""Tip"", but it did meet my expectations. Although the movie seemed to include way too many Rihanna songs up to the very ending. More important though, it's a good movie to bring the kids too, since they will love the animation and creativity, and it will carry their interest. I definitely recommend to others with children 12 and under."
95,Home,7,25 March 2015,"A bit of fun, superb soundtrack","25 March 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Home. The latest offering from Dreamworks had adults and children chuckling throughout, in fact some of the children giggled most of the way through. This is the story of Oh and Tip, Boov and Human respectively and how their two worlds collide. The Boov are always running from the Gorg and take over each planet they come to. This time it's earth's turn and having relocated all the humans the Boov move into their homes. Tip has been left behind and together with her cat Pig, she is trying to find her Mother. When she meets Oh, a most unpopular Boov, all kinds of Chaos ensue. Tip is voiced by Rhianna and Jim Parsons provides the voice and very much the character of Oh. Fans of The Big Bang Theory will breath a little sigh of contentment as they realise what they are watching is indeed and animated version of Sheldon, not quite so OCD but he's very much their in colour changing fabulousness. A bit of fun, and a superb soundtrack, my feet were tapping all the way through."
96,Home,9,27 March 2015,Logical and sensitive Oh: a wacky apocalyptic story of hope and friendship,"From the start, I cared about Oh. You will love him! His expressive face and his show-my-emotion chameleon colors, his misfortune, clumsiness, and naive-ways gets him into trouble. We pity Oh - he's an alienated alien. And this is what's fascinating about Oh: we care about him and his journey of growth and discovery. When Oh meets Gratuity Tucci, his transformation begins. Eventually Oh behaves like a human-Boov (or Boov-human?) and Gratuity-Tucci learns to tolerate and even appreciate the Boov Oh.Overall, Home was more about drama than laughter. Somewhat funny! But it is truly moving. The film is an adaptation of the middle-grade novel, ""The true meaning of Smekday,"" by Adam Rex. The main focus is the gradual understanding between Oh and the left-behind girl, Gratuity-Tucci. Nonetheless, Home promises to be a silly explosion of science-fiction, colorful wackiness and imaginative alien devises. But behind all that, there's a sensitive subject of invasion, abduction, war, threat of extinction, the clash of cultures, humans taken to reservations (or happy concentration camps in this case), and the triumph of human virtue. Serious! The synergy of Heart and logic is more powerful than logic alone. Scenes-wise, I love the fixing-up-the-car, which is one hilarious moments, literally dripping with creativity! I also like the visuals of what the Boov considers ""useless,"" and how they ""remove"" such items. Another great scene is the joke scene - so sweet and cute! But the most memorable scene is when Oh finds out that he doesn't have to run away if the probability of success is less than 50%: there's always hope, as Gratuity-Tucci teaches him. I also love the scene when Oh discovers the significance of human boding: family love. Oh determines that Tip's condition is that of a ""Sad-mad,"" girl, because she misses her mother and she hates the Boov for what they have done to her Planet. In the end, Oh unearths his true heart, and through his goodness and logic he becomes a key player in the Human-Boov-Gorg conflict. Gratuity Tucci's character shines with forgiveness and kindness and she's smart! And another discovery that Oh makes is when he realizes that this ""humansgirl"" accepts mistakes as part of being humans...This is an epiphany to Oh. I love the character growth!About the performance: The choice of Jim Parsons to play the voice of Oh is perfect. Parsons already plays a very logical scientist that behaves more like a robot than a person (Big Bang Theory TV show). Rihanna also is a great match for Gratuity-Tucci: feisty, playful, sentimental, and strong-willed. Jennifer Lopez pours some great emotion and attitude into her Gratuity-Tucci's mother character as well! Stories between an alien and an earthling are not new: remember the classic TV-show ""My favorite Martian?"" The movies ET? Echo? Planet 51? Terra? Even Distric 9 shares some elements with Home. But what's new about Home? It's all about its true meaning: the discovery of hope and friendship and forgiveness and its life-changing consequences. One more thing, Oh also reminds me of Beegu: a lovable alien character in a children's picture book written and illustrated by Alexis Deacon.Perhaps Home won't make you laugh as much, but it will give topics to think and talk about, all amidst bubbly and silly entertainment! And you will smile and get teary-eyed at the end...Home is strong storytelling: it will touch your heart! Cheers!"
97,Home,4,16 May 2015,"A few funny parts and creative visuals don't make a great movie, people.","According to the user reviews on here, they seem to like it more than Guardians Of The Galaxy(which has been getting WAY too many haters, I thought it was a perfect movie). If this is what passes for the general public today, I'm out. Home is a movie only for 7 year olds with colorful character designs and juvenile comedy. While I will admit I do like the art style of the technology, Steve Martin's performance as Captain Smek is hilarious, and there is the occasional joke that gets a laugh, Home is mostly just a cash cow to sell toys and Rihanna songs that has childish humor that is mostly just gross-out gags and slapstick with silly noises, a lowbrow performance from Jim Parsons(who is a funny guy in my book), and a cheesy subplot with Tip and her mom. I'd choose Guardians Of The Galaxy any day if I would watch a sci-fi comedy, no matter how many negative comments it got. As for Home, it's a bland, kiddish, and undeniably poorly written film that has its funny moments and inventive visuals, but is not particularly a film worth spending your money on. Please don't tear GOTG apart and just give it a chance, because if this is what you call good, then you are extremely mistaken"
98,Home,,30 March 2015,"Twentieth Century Fox, why would you advertise an upcoming 3D DreamWorks computer-graphics-animated movie called HOME?","Twentieth Century Fox, please explain to every Australian, why would you advertise an upcoming 3D DreamWorks computer-graphics-animated movie called HOME, when Twentieth Century Fox had no intention of ever showing that film in 3D? ABOUT HOME was released from 7 March 2014 by Twentieth Century Fox, to be then screened with each new DreamWorks children's' movie. I have seen this fast-paced, wonderful, charming and captivating 3D DreamWorks computer-graphics-animated four minute comedy short called ""ALMOST HOME"" several times now. Before the 3D Mr. Peabody and Sherman, and 3D Penguins of Madagascar, plus the Blue Sky Studios film 3D Rio 2.The Boov's ship runs from several ""safe"" planets, where the dictator leader of the aliens called the Boov, their Captain Smek (voiced by Steve Martin) had assured his fellow Boov that there was no possibility of any danger to the Boov, however again and again, each new safe planet turns out to be very unsafe. Captain Smek, is very funny as the forever lying dictator who continually takes credit for finding each new planet, however when each planet turns out horrible, suddenly Captain Smek denies responsibility. The trouble is that on 19th March 2015, I went to see the full length 3D version of HOME in my local multi-screen cinema, but if you live anywhere in Australia, then Twentieth Century Fox has chosen to never ever allow screenings of the full length 3D version of HOME in any of our 2,057 Australian Cinema screens."
99,Home,5,27 March 2015,"""Home"" is a pleasant enough diversion, but not all that special.","Ah, Home Sweet Home. It may not be perfect and we may take it for granted, but at least it's ours until it isn't. What happens when someone else without a home decides that your old home is going to be their new home? You might not like it very much, but if the newcomers are numerous and technologically advanced enough to do what they want, you just might have to move anyway. Now, it occurs to me that the scenario I just described should sound familiar to anyone who has watched the news ever. But that scenario is actually the basic plot of the animated adventure comedy ""Home"" (PG, 1:34). However, in this case, the invaders do a lot more than cross an invisible political boundary line to arrive at their new home.This film is a story of displaced beings, culture shock, misunderstandings, mistakes and misplaced priorities. The main character is ""Oh"" (voiced by Jim Parsons). That's Oh, as in ""Oh, Brother!"", ""Oh, no!"" or ""OMG!"" Oh isn't very popular among his fellow short, stocky, color-changing, grammatically-challenged aliens called the Boov. Oh makes a lot of mistakes, but he's also not your average Boov in other ways. The Boov are very practical, pessimistic and not very friendly. As the song says, ""Two Out of Three Ain't Bad"", right? Oh believes in the regimented nature of his society, but he wants to be everyone's friend (even though no one wants to be his) and he's an optimist. He's excited about the adventure of moving to the planet called Earth. For everyone else, it's just another Boov move to hide from their deadly enemy, the Gorg. No one really knows why the Gorg are after the Boov, but the Boov leader, the arrogant, but clueless Captain Smek (Steve Martin), tells his followers that earth is the place where the Gorg won't find them. But the Boov have to make room for themselves first. You see, earth is rather well inhabited.As a race of extraterrestrial refugees, the Boov've developed the technology and the procedures that can clear a planet quickly. For the beings being cleared, it's a painless, if unwelcome process. The Boov space ships basically vacuum up all the people and consolidate them in one location and give them newly-built homes. In the case of earth, the humans are all resettled in Australia in a group of communities called ""Happy Human Land"". Sure, they've been taken from their homes, but at least they get free ice cream. And the Boov get to inhabit the ready-made human cities, while trying to make sense of cultural artifacts like spare tires and charcoal grills. The Boov are very efficient relocators, but this time they missed someone. Tween girl Gratuity ""Tip"" Tucci (Rihanna) was shielded from the Boov's sensors by her fat cat named Pig, but Tip did lose her mother (Jennifer Lopez) to the Boov's vacuums and she thinks that really sucks. (See what I did there??)Oh and Tip soon meet up and start helping each other out. Tip isn't very happy with the Boov, but she realizes that Oh can help her find her mother. Oh has just made a mistake that endangers the existence of his entire race, so he's on the run from his own kind. Oh turns Tip's mother's car into a hover craft, and they're off. First, they have to stop in Paris (where the Boov have set up their headquarters and converted the Eiffel Tower into a giant antenna) and then start flying Down Under. Still, Australia is pretty far off, even by hover craft. Along the way, Tip's music teaches (read, forces) Oh to learn how to dance. And that's just the Tip of the iceberg (you did catch that one, right?) when it comes to Oh's growing understanding of human culture and human emotions. Oh, and Oh doesn't really plan to go to Australia. He wants to get to Antarctica, the only place on earth where there are no other Boov. You see, the Boov place survival (of their race and themselves as individuals) above all else, including promises made and the needs of others.""Home"" is fairly entertaining, visually attractive and even kind of deep, but isn't terribly original. The plot has noticeable aspects of ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and, obviously, ""The Odd Couple""  all with a child-friendly sensibility, of course. Adult audience members may notice parallels with world problems (like I described in my first paragraph) and messages that range from anti-colonialism to pro-family, but this movie is primarily meant for kids. Kids that were unusually quiet audience members. The one baby in the audience made more noise than the kids who could talk. And I know there were other kids in the theater with me, because they were yucking it up at the ""Minions"" trailer before ""Home"" started. The movie looks very good (especially in 3-D), the computer animation is as outstanding as we've come to expect (from the detail in the spaceships to the texture of the aliens' skin), but there weren't that many truly funny moments  in my opinion or the opinion of those kids sitting around me in the theater. This movie is a pleasant enough diversion, but you might be better off waiting until this one comes out on video and just watching ""Home"" at well, you know. ""B-"""
100,Home,7,26 March 2015,Fun for kids,"Greetings again from the darkness. Depending upon your expectations for animated films, you will either find this latest from DreamWorks to be nice entertainment for kids, or a bit too simplistic for adults. Twenty years ago Pixar ushered in a golden age of animation with the first Toy Story, and the grading curve was forever changed. If you can accept that not every animated film need be an instant classic, the odds are good that kids will find this to be a very enjoyable hour and a half.Oh (yes, that's his name) is the friendliest and most energetic of all the Boovs, a society of technologically advanced aliens who change color based on emotions (similar to a mood ring). The Boovs also excel at running from adversity  especially when their enemy Gorg is chasing. When Captain Smek decides his Boovs will take over earth, he orders the banishment of all humans to Australia (kind of funny when you think about the history of that continent). Left behind is one youngster named Tip (short for Gratuity Tucci, one of the oddest ever screen names for a kid) and her pet, Pig the Cat. It turns out both Oh and Tip are misfits in their own world, and are forced to team up so that Oh can redeem himself and Tip can be reunited with her mother.The main (and obvious) themes are: stay true to yourself, accept others for what they are (even if they are different from you), and family is important and worth fighting for. Tip is kind of a confusing character because she knows how to drive a car, but admits to being a 7th grader originally from Barbados. Oh has no Boov friends because he is so darned personable and he is always making mistakes  usually due to his desire to connect with others. Captain Smek's false confidence catapults him into a leadership position, based mostly on his ability to retreat from the difficult decisions. Even the villain Gorg (who looks/dresses like Shredder from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) is simply misunderstood.As you would expect, there is humor throughout  most of it at a level that those under age 11 will appreciate (that's not a bad thing). These laughs come courtesy of bubble wrap, a cookbook, awkward dancing, and a hover car that runs on fast food staples like Nacho Mama, Busta Lime frozen drinks, and Burrito Torpedoes. There is a recurring gag showing clumps of earthly items deemed unnecessary by the Boovs, and this gives adults in the audience something to track.Crucial to the film's success is the voice acting. Oh is voiced by Jim Parsons as an E.T. version of Sheldon Cooper from ""The Big Bang Theory"". His twisted version of the English language (""sad-mad"") is good for a few chuckles, but mostly his eagerness and openness make Oh a character kids will care about. Rihanna voices Tip, and has at least 3 songs on the soundtrack. She does well in capturing the strength and vulnerability of this character who is on a mission to find her mother. Also fun is hearing Matt Jones as Kyle, the 'is he or is he not' friend of Oh. Fans of ""Breaking Bad"" will recognize Mr. Jones as Badger from that series. Not quite as effective are Jennifer Lopez as Tip's mother and Steve Martin as Captain Smek. Mr. Martin especially could have brought more spark and color to his role.Director Tim Johnson (Over the Hedge, Antz) took the source material from Adam Rex's book ""The True Meaning of Smekday"" and delivered an animated film with a refreshing approach  it doesn't feature violence, inappropriate humor or a smart-ass kid that disrespects adults. It's a shame that the unique color palette is quashed by the 3-D technology  and what's up with the awful title?  but overall, this is one the kids can enjoy (especially if they are struggling to fit in)."
101,Home,8,26 March 2015,"A minor home run for DreamWorks, but a home run nonetheless.","Is there a blander title in the world than Home? It's a curiously boring choice for the latest animated effort from DreamWorks Animation, which once bore the far more irreverent and intriguing name of Happy Smekday!. Look beyond its title, however, and you'll find a smart, sparky movie that isn't afraid to be gleefully dumb and deeply heartfelt in telling its story and finding its characters.The film takes place against a backdrop of benign intergalactic invasion. With all humans swiftly relocated to camps in distant parts of the planet, Earth becomes the latest home for the nomadic Boov  a cheerfully clueless race of colour-changing aliens who have a history of avoiding confrontation. Oh (voiced by Jim Parsons) is a well-intentioned misfit who accidentally alerts the Boov's enemies to their new whereabouts. When Oh tries to run away from his mistake, he meets Gratuity 'Tip' Tucci (Rihanna), a brave, resourceful teenage girl who just wants to be reunited with her mother Lucy (Jennifer Lopez). Together, this odd couple bicker their way into becoming friends.There's a zany, offbeat joy threaded throughout Home that's impossible to resist. It takes a story with a real heart of darkness and finds the light in it  primarily by allowing the budding friendship between Oh and Tip to take centre stage. Both characters are a great deal of fun to hang out with. The endearingly goofy Oh  a bumbling fool with a heart of gold  provides us with his outsider's view of the Boov narrative. Tip, meanwhile, is as fierce, feisty and fantastic a representative of the human race as anyone could wish. As they travel across the world in a car powered by the electric power of sugary drinks, with purring rumble-machine Pig the Cat in tow, Tip teaches Oh about courage, humanity and the true importance of dance. It's a relationship that feels real, progressing as it does from mutual hostility to genuine respect and love.These more heartfelt, thoughtful moments  which extend even to the grim and relentless Gorg, sworn enemies of the Boov  are balanced with humour that dances between sharp and silly. Oh brings apparent doom to his people when he sends a housewarming party invitation to the whole universe: a catastrophic security loophole in his e-mail settings that's almost gloriously ridiculous, and one that pretty much anyone who's run afoul of the 'reply-all' function can appreciate. At the other end of the comedy spectrum, Captain Smek (a manically delightful Steve Martin), the pompous, cowardly leader of the Boov, capers around in increasingly silly hats, relieving stress by rolling himself across a sheet of bubble wrap.One might wish for Home to be a little bolder  to dare to look, at least a little, into the monumental darkness of its premise. Instead, the Boovs' collective lack of empathy and callous treatment of the human race is reduced simply to a turning point in Oh's character development. The film's soundtrack is also overly crowded with a clutch of original Rihanna songs, none of which is particularly inspiring or as immediately catchy as Lopez's hit single for the film, Feel The Light.Nonetheless, Home is a colourful blast of fun for kids  not to mention adults who are willing to give it a chance. This touching story about the power of friendship and empathy unfolds in both goofy and sincere fashion, through a skillful blend of good-natured humour, gravity-defying action sequences and moments of deep emotional truth. The narrative beats of this road-trip movie might feel a little familiar at times, but it's also smartly subversive in its own way: it readily celebrates a pair of protagonists who don't fit or reinforce the Hollywood norm, and it recognises that stories of families and friends can power stories just as well as romance can."
102,Home,10,28 March 2015,10/10,"Home is one of the best animated movies I've had ever watched. Thumbs up to the studio and congratulations on such an inspiring & cute movie.People, watch the movie, it's really worth to watch and also have fun with your kids, friends.. I don't want to write some spoilers so.. all I can say is that this movie is much better than the rest of the animated movies which came out before HOME!!! I literally fell in love but some of you always find something to criticize a movie which has been released by dreamworks, right? Just chill and enjoy this wonderful movie instead of hating and criticising every aspect of it, it's a kids movie, so chill."
103,Home,10,13 July 2015,Such an amazing movie,"The reviews i saw disgusted me. I thought this was such a good movie, and I am totally obsessed with it. I have seen it around 7 times and I am still not tired of it. Of course it's not perfect! Nothing is. I have seen people complaining about the bad English of the movie : Boov are aliens, of course they don't speak fluent English. The bad English makes it even more realistic. Then I saw people complaining about the humour. It is true that the movie isn't hilarious, but instead of focusing on the humour in the movie, try focusing on something else! The jokes are not what makes a movie enjoyable, the story makes it enjoyable. Of course this movie will not be a classic. It doesn't mean it is bad! The producers and the actor's don't deserve such reviews as the ones I saw, they spend around 3 years making this movie. And even if you don't like the movie, you have to admit, the animation was amazing. Tip's hair looked real and you can see the pupil's pattern in Oh's eye.I think everyone should give this wonderful movie seconds thoughts."
104,Home,1,5 July 2015,Worst Cartoon I've ever seen,"No spoilers, just warning you to not waste your or your child's time with this movie that made no sense and had no humor whatsoever. It was SO STUPID. The voice overs were terrible. The actors only used this movie to promote their own music agendas. (Rihanna, seriously???!!!?) She is an almost 30 year old woman trying to play a CHILDs voice?! Are the people who choose these character voices deaf?? it was just horrible. I sat through the whole thing for the sake of my children and I TRIED to enjoy it. Really. I just hated it. Watch any other move ever created. ANY OF THEM! No creativity. No humor. No entertainment whatsoever."
105,Home,5,8 June 2015,A contender for Dreamworks' weakest,"As much as this viewer wasn't crazy about Shark Tale and Bee Movie and had mixed feelings on Penguins on Madagascar, she found herself less impressed by Home than any of those three films put together. Home is not an awful film and there are far worse animated films about, it's just that it was from personal view felt very average at best on the whole.The best asset of Home is the animation. With its rich and bright colours, smooth character designs, colourful visual flourishes, visual depth and meticulously detailed background art, the animation here is terrific and the only thing about Home that was really great. The voice acting was a very mixed bag, but Steve Martin and surprisingly Jennifer Lopez fare well. Martin, while not having a lot to do, is very good and amusing, while Lopez brings heart and compassion where the film very much needs it(this was surprising considering that I, like many others, do not rate Lopez particularly highly as an actress).While one wishes that more was done with the mother-daughter story, it did give the story some heart and it is something that a lot can empathise with. Home also has a few amusing spots, the Boovs are mostly cute and fun and there are splashes of creativity towards the end.Jim Parsons' voice acting on the other hand was incredibly obnoxious, almost as annoying as Will Smith's voice acting for Shark Tale. One reviewer described Parsons' voice and character here as Sheldon's(The Big Bang Theory) annoying factor multiplied by a hundred, and that couldn't be a more accurate description. Rhianna does not fare quite as problematically, because at least she tries to emote, but the voice to me didn't really fit her character, sounding rather too grown-up and trying-too-hard. Tip is also never really developed enough to allow one to properly relate to her, and while she is nowhere near as annoying as Oh she isn't very likable either and the chemistry between the two characters lacks natural charm.Home has a few very mildly amusing parts, but on the most part the humour factor is low and too many of the jokes are forced and juvenile, and much of the dialogue is tired and high in predictability and clichés and low on humour and emotional resonance. Likewise the emotional parts could have been better executed, sometimes heartfelt but too often saccharine. Admittedly more of an effort was made here with the mother-daughter but even that despite a heartfelt atmosphere didn't feel developed enough. The characters and their personalities range from flat to annoying, the pacing is constantly erratic with one part feeling rushed and the next feeling dull, and the unnecessary and tacked-on-at-very-last-minute-feeling end twist undermined the creativity that went into the final act. The predictability of the story would have been forgivable, if the humour and emotional factors were handled well, the characters were engaging and if there was more evidence of effort going into the film outside of the animation, seeing as neither are done particularly well here in Home that wasn't so easy to forgive.The story was also not the easiest to follow, changing shifts and emotions so often it was almost dizzying, and at other times it was simplistic and like they were running out of ideas too early so added more to pad the running time out. But the worst aspect was the soundtrack. The songs themselves range from decent to just okay with a few forgettable ones(nothing too god-awful), and would fare well on their own. Within the film however, the soundtrack just doesn't gel, it did feel over-scored and like there were too many songs incorporated and most of the songs sounded horribly out of place as a result, coming over as more of a new album promotion or a Rhianna vanity project.Overall, Home is not an awful film but not particularly good either. Of Dreamworks' hit-and-miss(mostly hits actually) output it is a contender for their weakest, The Prince of Egypt, How to Train Your Dragon, Shrek and Antz this isn't. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
106,Home,7,11 April 2015,"Not Bad, don't like the voices.","The movie was alright. Unlike most people, I don't like the voice of Sheldon Cooper as the alien creature, and I think there is too much Rihanna in the movie, pretty much all the songs and the girls voice. Although she did she surprised me with her voice acting, it wasn't bad at all. The story was alright, I was bored in the beginning, but got more interested later on. Not quite Disney caliber, but not bad at all. The emotional bits in the movie weren't bad either.As with most movies, I will not voluntarily see the movie again, as it wasn't super amazing."
107,Home,7,10 April 2015,"A fun movie but, definitely not one of DreamWorks Animation's best.","Home tells the story of Oh(Jim Parsons), who is part of an alien race called the Boov. Oh is declared a fugitive by his fellow Boov & is on the run from Captain Smek(Steve Martin), who is the leader of the Boov, Kyle(Matt Jones) & the rest of the Boov for committing a huge mistake. While on the run, Oh meets Gratuity 'Tip' Tucci(Rihanna) who is looking for her mother Lucy(Jennifer Lopez), after they get separated when the Boov take over the Earth. Oh agrees to help Tip find her mom & Oh must also find a way to correct his mistake. Home is an entertaining film that the whole family will enjoy. However, kids will enjoy it more than adults. Usually, animated movies have a lot of humor in them to make sure the kids & the adults have a whale of a time. However, Home mostly consists of slapstick jokes that kids will appreciate much more than adults. There's a running gag in the movie where the Boov speak in slightly defective English. This is funny at first but after a while, the gag gets old. DreamWorks Animation's previous movies like, the How to Train Your Dragon series, Mr. Peabody & Sherman(2014), the Shrek series, the Kung Fu Panda series, The Croods(2013), the Madagascar series & so on are better. The highlights of the movie are the adorable characters & the strong relationships depicted between Oh & Tip & Tip & her mother. The animation is magnificent. The 3D is great! Jim Parsons is spectacular as Oh. Parsons is adorable as the lovable little Boov who changes colors whenever he experiences a different emotion. This proves that Parsons can portray any character & not just the know-it-all Dr. Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory. Rihanna is amazing as Gratuity 'Tip' Tucci. Steve Martin is funny as Captain Smek. Jennifer Lopez is awesome as Lucy. Matt Jones is good as Kyle. Home is not a must watch but, it's the perfect film to watch on a day out with your family."
108,Home,8,29 March 2015,Awesome Family Feel Good Movie,"I went to see this today with my family (wife and daughter) and as a 39 year old dad I loved it. Funny in places. Sad and moving in others and always heartwarming and held my attention from the start.Stunning animation and the movie has a great sound track.Any family movie that takes you on a roller-coaster of emotion is Pure Gold.This is the equal of Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc or Despicable Me.In a world full of cynicism, violence, hate and crime this is 90 minutes of wonder and escapism that makes you glow inside as you leave the Cinema.Go and see it, you won't be disappointed.Ignore the negative reviews from so called 'professional critics'. They get paid to find fault and never give the credit something deserves."
109,Home,7,30 March 2015,Home is a funny and touching animated film about loneliness among different races and species,"Last year, me and my movie theatre-working friend saw a short called Home Again which seemed rushed though we later found out it was a preview of this feature. What we now just saw was a pretty funny and touching tale of one alien from another planet and a little girl who's been seemingly abandoned bonding together and finding out their destinies. Jim Parsons is the voice of Oh who is often shunned where he's from and Rhianna is the voice of Tip who's looking for her mother who-like other Earthlings-has been relocated after Oh's planet's leader basically invaded this world. Nice parable of loneliness and alienation that should provide some good thoughts to viewers who can relate. So on that note, me and my friend recommend Home."
110,Home,8,29 March 2015,If E.T. had a lot to say,"In this wonderfully animated world, where small aliens named Boov, take over earth, they move the earth people to a different location, this alien race change color when ever they show different emotions. But one of them named Oh(voiced by Jim Parsons) accidentally set off a signal that could lead there enemy called The Gord, Oh soon goes on the run, he meets up with 13 year old human girl named Tip(voiced by Rihanna), who is looking for her mother, they must learn to trust each other in hopes to survive, but the question is will they? Jim Parsons brings the same comic appeal to this, that he brings to the Big Bang Theory. So does Rihanna, and supporting cast like Jennifer Lopez and Steve Martin to name a few. It kind of feels like a parody of those kid friendly alien movies and alien invasion films also. Still an enjoyable film for the whole family."
111,Home,8,4 April 2015,Close Encounters of the Fun Kind,"HOME (2015) *** (Voice of: Jim Parsons, Rihanna, Steve Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Matt Jones) Sci-fi animated fare about a race of cowardly aliens that take over Earth but find immediate jeopardy when their most well-meaning but socially awkward members Oh (high octane Parsons) gives the enemy their new location. Hoping to rectify his wrong he befriends a human tween, Tip (a surprisingly energized Rihanna) who needs him to help her relocate her displaced mother inevitably leading to an odd couple bonding into BFF scenario. Colorful, funny and indeed warm-heartedly uplifting with its universal message (love yourself and your family even if family is your friends) for all ages to enjoy. (Dir: Tim Johnson)"
112,Home,6,31 March 2015,Corny Confection,"When I first saw the trailer of this new DreamWorks animated film last year, I felt I might not like it. The title was indistinct, the alien character looked corny and the girl character had zero charm. But I had made wrong first impressions about previous DreamWorks projects before, like ""Shrek"", ""How to Train Your Dragon"", and ""The Croods"" which all turned out to be very enjoyable and heartwarming films despite the ""unattractive"" animation styles. Even ""Spirit"", ""Megamind"" and ""Turbo"" turned out much better than what I expected them to be from the trailers. So, not wanting to judge this book based on its cover, we also gave ""Home"" a chance.The Boov were a cute alien race who prided themselves with being cowardly and indifferent. Running away from their sworn enemy the Gorg, the Boov, under the leadership of their dictator Captain Smek, occupy Earth. One particularly odd Boov was known as ""Oh"" because of the exasperated groans of other Boov who could not stand his sunny friendly ways. Oh just wanted to send an e-invitation to his ""warming of house"" party but he inadvertently sends it to the whole universe, including the Gorg. Because of this costly mistake, Oh becomes a fugitive.Meanwhile, a young girl named Tip apparently escaped the vacuuming machine which extracted all humans from their homes, including her mother Lucy. She and her fat cat Pig were constantly on the run from the Boov which had overrun New York City. When Tip meets Oh, she pleads with (or coerces) him to help her find her mom. From there, the two go on an adventure that brings them around the world from Paris to Australia, developing an unusual friendship and saving the world.Initially, the very bright color palette and cute marshmallow-like alien design make this very attractive. The visual comedy did not always come off successfully, like the globes of toilet bowls and garbage cans, or the landmarks with Smek's face. Unfortunately, the story did not really develop into something memorably funny or interesting. The friendship that bonded Oh and Tip together seemed shallow and forced, not very well-developed in the storytelling. The final resolution of the problem with the Gorg was an overused plot point. There was only one scene that I could call truly touching.Jim Parsons voiced Oh like he was playing his signature Sheldon character on his hit TV show ""Big Bang Theory"". It was occasionally cute, occasionally annoying. Many of his jokes in broken English actually felt flat. Aside from the dancing scene (which we already saw in the trailer), I cannot recall any other really big humorous moment from him. The voicing of Tip was okay, but it was made more remarkable when the end credits came up and you see that it was pop star Rihanna who did it. Steve Martin unfortunately did not get to do anything distinctive as Captain Smek's voice. Jennifer Lopez's very short stint as mom Lucy could have been done by any other voice actress.For me, the film itself was just mildly entertaining at best. Not the worst film by DreamWorks, but not one of their best. 6/10."
113,Home,,14 March 2015,"Aodrable, colorful and well done!","DreamWorks Animations Home shows some in-roads in animation. Through use of some new technology that allows for character close-ups, as well as improved character movements and textures, the story was more powerfully expressed. Emotions were stronger and more pronounced as a result.Home is a delightful tale and an important tale about how we tend to judge others before getting to know them. However, if we take the time to get to know the person(s) we prejudged, we find that we might have missed out on a great friendship(s).Home, while a children's tale, is entertaining and enjoyable for adults. Visually it is wonderful and the animation is colorful, cheerful and creative. The character architecture was brilliant and technically superb.The audio balance was perfection. For once I could hear dialog without the music overpowering and drowning out dialog. Music was appropriate and natural with scenes.The voice characterizations were well performed. It was easy to become immersed into the fantasy world of Boov aliens trying to take over Earth.I highly recommend this film for everyone. There is a little something for all ages."
114,Home,8,22 January 2016,Brings the kid inside you,"That movie earned with me the highest I can ever give an animation movie, 8. Between the childish pop songs and the free spirit of 'Oh', they main character, this movie brought a child that was deeply buried in me underneath the problems of my everyday life.The characters are surprisingly well developed, and the comedy, though cheesy, is still very sweet and funny.It is the perfect movie for a child/family time, but also if you are looking for a pick me up.I don't understand why some people have a problem with this movie, but I would definitely recommend it."
115,Home,8,4 January 2016,"Fresh, funny, fast-paced, entertaining","The trailer was promising, but I was very pleasant surprised by the film itself. Today it is rare that a trailer looks promising while misleading, without giving out the actual story. The whole film was entertaining, funny, and full of fresh ideas. Spoilers follow. There is Earth, and there are a group of funny looking Aliens called Booves looking for a new home. Just in the beginning of the film, the Earth has been invaded just like that in a non-violent manner. Humans were move to a remote place on the same Earth, but not killed.Witnessing this I was not sure if this is really happening or is a simulation or something, because they invaded Earth so quickly I could not properly adapt to the development of the plot. In other films invading Aliens are depicted as evil and destructive. Here it was like a conflict: Friendly looking aliens, highly advanced in technology, while a bit of naive and stupid, invading Earth for no clear reason but searching for a new home, while having quite a good home on their ship. They do not need energy, and do not really need our stuff. Instead of using our gadgets, they make fun of them...The twist coming at the end is a pleasant surprise and will soon be topped by yet another twist surrounding the identity of the other Aliens who are chasing the Booves for apparently no reason but being bad by definition.The alien technology presented here is, while not to be taken too serious, refreshing and really advanced in contrast to the futuristic human technology presented as super advanced alien technology in many other films. The animation is not quite state of the art (other humans look like dolls except for the main characters), but still good. The film makers appear to be inexperienced in building emotional moments: The girl is supposed to be worrying about the Boove taking a swim, but I could not really feel that. The film built up to the moment where the girl meets her mother, that is supposed to be touching, but it did not felt this way to me despite of the epic music."
116,Home,10,23 December 2015,what's with all the hate??,"This movie was good! not fantastic like shrek but good! When this film came out I loved it. its like movie critics ruin other movies for other people! just think about it. what if this was the only movie in the world, and you can only watch this?? APPRECIATE WHAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE, the movies may suck but still.. Directors bring these films to you and you have a fit?? Imagine if we didn't have ANY movies to watch. Learn to appreciate what you have. i'm not saying you can't hate on these films, at least appreciate them! I bet if all of the movies we have today didn't exist, we would be dying of boredom. Appreciate! I shed a tear watching this. I don't know how people are like this..."
117,Home,10,24 August 2017,Beter than expected!,"When the movie began, i thought the story wouldn't be so nice etc. But, wow the movie was really good and i just loved the English of Oh. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so i'm not gonna say much. For me a movie gets a 10/10 when the movie gets me glued to the sit or makes me cry or laugh really hard. This movie made me cry in the end but i don't want to reveal why see it for yourself."
118,Home,9,5 August 2017,A great movie that's giving you a special feeling,"When I started watching this movie, for the first few minutes I thought this was just going to be another modern 3D animation, falling into non- sophisticated family drama and dry but OK comedy, but Home truly amazed me.Because the way it makes you feel, is special and unique. The feeling started since the beginning of their advantage(Tip and OH) with soundtracks played in their bubble-flashy flying car, I noticed people blaming there were too many songs of Rihanna's, but I didn't notice and did not care.It's like swimming in a colorful pool and you can see rainbows while feeling potentially being suffocated but not really. The adventure was not intense at all, but with the special background music it makes me feel like the movie makers were intentionally making it this way and it's really special and unique, in a great way.The movie is not just for children, actually I tend to think there was something in Home that's only for adults to taste and understand, family, bravery, love...But beyond that, the loneliness of being an outcast in a social environment being eliminated by those who care about you, and henceforth the thing they give you which you would cherish forever----hope. And then, you get to feel the warmth, the ""temperature"", the HOME.Indeed, why isn't it called Planet Earth or A Friendship Between Me And A Poov? Because, there's something worthy of your thinking, and it's what's called home.The only drawback I think is the length of the movie is a little short, it feels like the makers were trying to condense it, so sometimes I feel the inconsistencies between several subsplots at the end, but the feeling did not fade away. Overall, I give it 9 out of 10."
119,Home,6,21 May 2017,It was mehh,"The plot, animation,and connection between the characters were cute, but honestly, it wasn't Dreamworks's best work. The movie was decent,and I want to love it, but Rihanna's role pretty much ruined it for me. I felt like Tip's age and persona didn't match with the Rihanna's voice too well in my opinion, and her character in general seemed so basic. ""Oh"", the other protagonist, was adorable, and I think had more character development than Tip's, and he seemed much more interesting. The film wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either, they tried, you can tell, but they didn't pull it off all too well in my opinion, DreamWorks could've done better. However I do like their Netflix original series (same name), the humor is much more fluid, the characters are much more developed, and in each episode they have such an original plot, so at least they've had a positive outcome from the movie."
120,Home,6,30 March 2016,Forgettable But Entertaining Family Flict,"Story: After a hive-minded alien race called the Boov conquer the Earth, they relocate the planet's human population -- all except for a little girl named Tip (Rihanna), who's managed to hide from the aliens. When Tip meets a fugitive Boov called Oh (Jim Parsons), there's mutual distrust. However, Oh is not like his comrades; he craves friendship and fun. As their distrust fades, the pair set out together to find Tip's mother, but, unbeknown to them, the Gorg -- enemies of the Boov - - are en route.My Opinion: 6/10 (Okay)Critics: Colorful, silly, and utterly benign, Home is a passable diversion, but there's no shortage of superior animated alternatives.I thought the film was okay, but there are far better family films."
121,Home,5,29 February 2016,"Like My Tea, Half and Half","This film is about as middle of the road as you can get There is good, and bad to be had in this film. First, the good. The one thing you can count on from DreamWorks is their stunning animation. They can easily rival Pixar in terms of delivering breathtaking animation especially for the backgrounds and foregrounds. The voice acting is very well done especially Jim Parsons as Oh, and Steve Martin as Captian Smek. Also the character animation is also very good. While the design is very simple for the aliens as they're not a creative as some other aliens in movies. But they are unique for the fact they are so simple, and I think it makes you better understand the vibe they want you to get off of the simplicity. Now, the negatives unfortunately have to do with the story. How many times is DreamWorks going to do the same storyline over and over again, I will spoil a little bit here, but if you've seen DreamWorks previous work How to Train Your Dragon 2, you will see what I am talking about. The child must find his/her long lost parent. Sure that's great the first time, but don't go all stale on us, be creative with the story instead of the same thing. And I don't get how old Tip is meant to be, is she in her teens, I'm not sure because Rihanna doesn't sound like a little girl. And stop doing films about aliens DreamWorks, this is the third film about them in less then a decade (Monster vs. Aliens, Megamind, and now Home). After DreamWorks incredible groundbreaking film HTTYD 2, they have managed to take the biggest step back that they could. Sure it brought the kiddies in, but after HTTYD 2, I was thoroughly disappointed. Hopefully DreamWorks can bounce back, because we need more companies like them, a company that takes chances and has variety, and keeps us guessing. FOr kids, this is for sure a safe film for them, so if you are looking for a harmless film to enjoy the family with, you can't go wrong with this. But as an adult, I will probably never see this again. Now to grade. Animation: A+ Character Design: A- Characters: B Music: C- Voice Acting: B+ Story: D+ Overall: C+"
122,Home,9,11 February 2016,i just can't understand,"well i feel bad for this movie to get only 6.7 it's a pretty good one and i don't know why all that disappointing of people it was a good one well maybe the only thing that songs of Rihanna demonstrating the movie but i think it was cool and good songs BTW ,it's a good movie from several ways the story the performance of Jim parsons ,the music ,the emotions and of course the cow jock (you'll know about it in the movie ) . if you want to feel good and escape the world if you want to feel a combination of joy cry happiness excitement and other great feeling this is the movie you wanna see and don't forget to grab some snacks for extra fun :P"
123,Home,5,22 November 2015,"Agree completely with other guy but he was being kind, 5/10 at best","I watch a lot of animations and cartoons and love me a feel good film. This movie had some basic elements and the overall moral was quite nice. But this movie had been done a million times before and in a million better ways. The main thing about this is that you have Rhianna.. If you like her you will probably like this film. I think all of the music was her. It annoyed me. Anywho, it was alright. It is a movie that you could watch to pass the time. Or put on at the back of the car for your kids. This movie is in no way great. or noteworthy in anyway. Unless of course you love Rhianna... then that would be it. And I guess that was all this movie was aiming for. Using that name to bring you all in. I wouldn't waste the time watching this again."
124,Home,5,12 November 2015,"Not bad for kids, don't expect too much","Dreamworks Studio is known for some pretty amazing animations. Kung-Foo Panda is probably their most well known, and I'm sure many of you have that film in your collection at home. I'd say the kids would love this short little flick, but there wasn't much going on in it. I certainly didn't get 'the feels.' I didn't want to pick apart the film for family viewers. If you're like me, and you simply watch films to get into them and distract yourself for an hour or so, then you'll probably get into this one. I found myself pretty bored after 30 minutes. I do like how Dreamworks took the initiative to put an African American girl as the main character (voiced by Rihanna, who of course is known for her music career rather than acting).I suppose it was more of a platform to get big name hip-hop artists, into a new medium. Kind of like 50 cent, and Eminem, and Ice-cube to name a few who have made that transition. Lots of Rihanna's music on the soundtrack so don't be surprised when her singing interrupts from time to time. The sound guy really cranked it up on this one.A couple of cute jokes, and some pretty decent animation, and some nice family moments, but overall a forgettable little movie.5/10On a side note: There were only Caucasian and African Americans in the film... and it got a little weird. Where were all the Middle-Eastern, Jewish, Asian, and Indian people? I mean... if the studio was pushing for multiculturalism... I didn't see a single one in the whole movie. Or homeless people for that matter. Ah well... don't expect too much."
125,Home,4,2 April 2015,Easily forgettable,"Generic Hollywood fluff basically what this movie is.The story to Home is about a group of friendly aliens uses Earth for their new hideout. But when one is inadvertently discovered by a human, he has no choice but to join forces with the teen and the two embark on a globe-spanning adventure to right his wrongs - and maybe find out the two races have a lot more in common then they thought.I remember back in February 2014 when I went to see Peabody and Sherman at the theater and when all the trailers to loads of different movies where over, then a short animated movie came on called Almost Home and it was only a couple of minutes long and it was a fine little short film...way better than the movie itself, I mean I'm being nasty but hey that's me being honest for you right here and it's not like I wanted this movie to be a generic kids movie.Jim Parsons does the voice work in this movie for are main character. Now I like Jim Parsons as an actor and him being in the Golden Globe wining TV show The Big Bang Theory, but in this he just plays Jim Parsons with a little salt of Sheldon Cooper. He didn't do horrible or anything like that he just didn't hind his voice while playing the character because although out the movie I had an image of Sheldon Cooper in my head every time the character speaks.Rihanna as we know isn't the greatest actress on the planet, actually she's horrible but now in this she voices a character that even when shes not in front of the camera she still can't pull of a good voice performance, because I didn't buy for one second that she played a young girl in this movie.The jokes in the movie felt really flat to me and I know this movie is for kids but I'm not sure if the kids will enjoy it, maybe they will or maybe they not at least the movie pretty animation to keep them focus and not get bored.Without spoiling anything in the movie I just got to say that the movie ended in such a cliché way that always happen in kids movies towards the end and that's character's dancing over their success and their victory. Every time that happens in kids movies I simply roll my eyes.For the only good things in the movie are the animation as it looks pretty and colorful to look at and the voice acting for the most part isn't as bad as I said early. Overall Home is an generic, cliché, playing it safe and easily forgettable."
126,Home,8,29 March 2015,"The ending might be predictable, but there's nothing predictable about the way we get there","It's another proof that well written characters can do wonders for a movie. I sometimes think that in certain movies there's nothing more important than the way the characters are written. Basically this cute and almost predictable story, is the Dreamworks way of telling us what they think is being human all about. It has only four and a half characters, but the way this story was written it makes sense. And as my title says, though often predictable - it's Hollywood one has to expect some predictability - the way we get to the predictable bits, is always original, and that's not all that simple. So I like the characters, I think the story has a point, I don't think the predictable bits hurt it too much. I also like the acting, I was positively surprised by Rihanna, who sounds like a kid without making us (or at least without making me) feel like she's an adult pretending to be one. I also loved Jim Parsons, though it could be argued that he's almost an alien in his breakthrough role at BBT. He's perfect as a would be real alien learning about being human. Steve Martin also repeats other roles he already did, but none of this matters. The entire concoction works, it's funny and moving when it should be, and it's not pretending to be anything more than good fun.I like good unpretentious fun, I think we should get more of it."
127,Home,4,27 March 2015,eh.....,"Cartoon for KIDS only! I am 24, animation movies lover, found it more appropriate for people under 16. Also seems like the scenario has been intentionally written for Rihanna; I would rather call it ''Marshmallows and Rihanna"".If you are not huge fan of her, just don't watch. Little bit sorry for the money spent on the ticket and the time wasted in the theater.As was expected something entertaining and exciting, something like ""Finding Nemo"". Unfortunately, it was somewhat boring and poorly written.Although it made me cry a couple times and think about how I was a little girl and watched short movies that taught me something good."
128,Home,7,15 April 2015,A cute and cuddly entertaining ride!,"A delightful movie buffed up real good by Jim Parson's voice. You see one of the most adorable aliens 'Oh' come alive through outstanding CGI. Not only that but you also see him change colours as per his ephemeral mood swings. Oh speaks with broken phrases, bizarre words and incorrect tenses but not for a second does he stop being adorable. Jim's voice just fits in the right grooves to impart the alien, a goofy yet an endearing sweetness.The movie is all Rihanna if you give the flick a close scrutiny. She has needle dropped her own songs in the flick to strike the right vibes along with giving her voice to a crucial character named Tip. Steve Martin sounds just as great as Captain Smek. The movie is packed with adorable aliens, cute acts, good laughs, plushy clumsiness and morality messages.The story however is really vapid and predictable. Jokes seem to be intended and aren't properly placed. The theme on which the movie runs is also quite clichéd. Being primarily a kid's movie, nothing dark covers the plot. All objects in the story are harmless. Sometimes the humour turns too cheesy and immature. But hey! If the child sitting next to me is laughing like crazy, who's complaining?Home is basically a movie for kids, and for you, provided the kid in you is still alive!"
129,Home,10,13 July 2015,awesome movie,What an amazing movie seen it twice now and the story line and screen play is amazing its am epic story and brings me to tears every time id highly recommend you see it if u can as you would be a fool to miss out on it thats how i find it so hard that some people are saying they yawned watching it its one of the best animations I've seen in a long time and has much more of a better storyline amthan any of the other animations I've seen over the last few years If i was given the choice of watching this over any of pixar animations then id choose this all day its way better than cars or toy story has much more of a realistic storyline and is more believable then you have the amazing musical tallents of jeniffer lopez and rihanna tho rihanna is the main carachter Throughout the movie For a 20th century fox production its amazing i deffo want to see it again and again the music is amazing as well you got a lot of amazing songs in this movie
130,Home,10,19 December 2015,My favorite animated movie.,"I saw previews for this movie and just kept moving. I never saw it in theaters. Something kept drawing me to the title when it was released in home media. I couldn't figure out why, but something made me want to watch the movie. In a moment of disposable income and inhibition, I bought the film and watched it at home. I was a sobbing mess by the end of the film as Rihanna's As Real As You And Me flowed from the TV speakers. I watch this movie about once a week, trying not to cry as the movie begins. Something about this movie hits an emotional spot for me. I do not know why, but I love the movie.With some animated films, I feel the plot is weak or I feel that it is a marketing ploy to sell toys. Not in this case. I felt that this was a well planned story. And the music melts me. I just bought the soundtrack this evening. I haven't paid for music since the days of Napster and BearShare. Give the movie a chance. Your box of tissues need to be held once in a while. :)"
131,Home,8,10 July 2015,"Enjoyable and cute. Not perfect, but it's okay.","I think Home is a pretty good original movie, all things considered. Older audience might not enjoy this as much as the kids, but animated movies are typically catered for children anyway so they shouldn't be expecting complicated plots or thrilling action sequences. It's made to be simple and straightforward so that kids can follow it easily. We follow two protagonists, who are both had problem fitting in. Against all odds, they fit together and their friendship saved the planet.The takeaways are simple, that you can't reap the rewards without taking risks (Tip & Oh approaching a Gorg drone and got a super chip). Family is important. Assumptions are dangerous (the Boovs assuming the humans are simple and helpless) and more likely wrong. Fear is often greater than the danger. And even when the odds are low, never give up.The Boovs are shown as a jittery, panicky creatures (the best at running away) and this movie shows how fear often leads to people (or aliens) making stupid assumptions and endangering themselves or others. On to the technicalities. I think this movie is well-animated, and it's very well- directed too. Especially around the last scenes when Tip arrived at the human settlement, and when the dust settles during the climax Gorg scene. In terms of character design, the Boovs are lovable enough. Would I want them as a plushie? Maybe not, but their character is more aimed towards comedic than adorable. Tip is a strong, brave girl that is adorable/vulnerable enough to be a kid, but still shows strength that should inspire young girls. Representation matters, and I think Tip is doing a great job of it. Now to the grievances. I'm not sure how much acting experience Rihanna had, but from this movie it seems like she didn't get a lot. Tip's tone of voice seems to only have two settings: angry or neutral. There's not a wide range of emotions in her voice, and I think that's why the animators are trying to compensate by showing Tip's emotions through gestures and expressions. She did a far better job at the soundtrack (which is totally understandable because she's more of a singer than an actor), but despite the amazing soundtrack at the near-end scene at the human settlement, some songs seems a bit off for other scenes.Also it's a bit obvious that Rihanna is one of the highlight in the movie because the main character is voiced by her, the soundtrack is by her, and every time someone turn on a radio, it's her singing. It's totally fine, but it throws me off just as much as when I see a brand featured prominently in a movie (product placement pays for the movie, I know)So bottom line, good children's movie with good morals. Voice acting is a bit wooden but it shouldn't bother younger audiences. Well-animated and interesting."
132,Home,6,27 May 2015,Home and Away.,"With the half term holidays about to arrive,I started searching round for a movie that a friend could watch with her kids.Taking a look recently for details about when Rihanna's new album is due out,I was surprised to find out that she had recently voiced a lead role in an animated film,which led to me getting ready to head home.The plot:Angering a powerful alien race called the Gorg,an alien race called the Boov find that whichever planet they choose to call their new home,the Gorg tracks them down,and blows the planet up. Franticly searching round for a new planet where they can hide away from the Gorg,the Boov spot a perfect looking planet called earth.Wanting to become the dominating race on earth,the Boov decide to invade the planet and transport most of the humans to isolated parts,so that they can use all of the technology left over.Recently getting his first ever flat,a Boov called Oh decides to send a housewarming E-Mail invite to his friends. Accidentally pressing ""send all"" Oh not only sends it to all of the Boov,but also puts it on a long-distance trip to the Gorg (Oh dear!) Under threat of being killed for putting his fellow Boov in danger,Oh goes undercover.Entering a shop to grab some food,Oh runs into a young girl called Gratuity 'Tip' Tucci,and her cat Pig.Since her mum got transported away from her home by the Boov,,""Tip"" has held a deep hatred for the Boov. Desperate to escape from the Boov,Oh tells ""Tip"" that he will help her to track down her mum,in exchange for keeping him undercover from his fellow Boov.View on the film:Supplying the catchy soundtrack,Rihanna gives a good performance as Gratuity 'Tip' Tucci,with Rihanna giving ""Tip"" an anti-social bite,which fades away as ""Tip"" starts to become friends with Oh.Joining Rihanna, Jim Parsons gives a terrific performance as Oh,as Parsons gives Oh a real self-righteousness in his belief that the Boov did nothing wrong in transporting the humans,whilst Steve Martin gives an explosive ,energetic performance as stuck-up boo- hiss baddie Captain Smek.Adapting Adam Rex's novel The True Meaning of Smekday,the screenplay by Tom J. Astle & Matt Ember impressively does not shy away from putting its characters in a grey area,as the writers reveal the Boov to be the major party who has caused the continuing feud with the Gorg.Despite the friendship between ""Tip"" and Oh features a few too many sudden changes (such as there being no mention of Oh changing the destination) the writers make sure to keep things moving along at a good pace,with ""Tip""'s adorable fur ball Pig keeping the friendship away from becoming sickly sweet.Covering a number of planets,director Tim Johnson gives the title a dazzling, vibrant appearance,thanks to Johnson giving each of the characters a minimally detailed design,which allows all of the Boov's to pop out on the screen,as ""Tip"" and Oh head home."
133,Home,6,16 March 2014,Almost There,"This short animated film hit the screens as a short subject with MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN. Apparently Dreamworks has decided that Pixar's habit of releasing a short along with their features is a good idea, both for trying out new talent and as a bonus to their features.While this is a well-animated effort recounting the efforts of a ship of aliens to find a new world when their old home has been destroyed, it never goes anyplace. True, the gags are well constructed, but the payoff is both predictable and aborted. Unless, of course, this is meant to be a teaser for Dreamworks' next proposed franchise. In the meantime, it's short, it's harmless and you'll chuckle a few times."
134,Home,7,30 March 2015,"""Happy Human Town"" seems as easy to set up as 1-2-3 . . .",". . . as the ""Boov"" flesh out all those age-old hypothetical questions beginning, ""Pretend that you've just arrived here from Mars . . . "" in HOME. Some people in the ""Red States"" (formerly known mostly as The Confederate States of America) may be bamboozled by a cute advertising campaign into taking their Next Generation to see HOME. After all, HOME's end credits list the names of 120 people developing HOME products such as pop-up books, pillow cases, cups, dolls, lunch boxes, and board games, not to mention all the Apps and graphic novels the 21st Century has to offer. Additionally, 33 people are named to market all this stuff. So what's HOME's message or theme for our impressionable kids? In a word, Redistribution. All human beings can fit in a cluster of Australian ""Happy Human Towns,"" if each person is willing to settle for their fair share of free food, free lodging, and free amusements. No one has to work. You can throw out ObamaCare, too; no one will ever be ill again when everyone is eating fresh fruits and vegetables exclusively, rather than Big Food's processed products and meats. Best yet, the remaining six continents become Disney Nature Trail Cam Wildlife Preserves!"
135,Home,8,14 August 2015,You Don't Have to be a Kid to Like This,"I don't get all the hate for this movie. I was hesitant to watch it. Yesterday with nothing to do watched it and loved it. Way better than Minions in the aspect of being cute. Loved the plot. Yeah it was cliché, but it was a unique kind of cliché. I loved Jim Parson's voice in this Rihianna was not bad as well. The animation was great I loved the style. And the characters along with the props were creative and semi-believable. Laughed through out the whole movie did not even get one bit annoyed by the bad English. For some reason I actually liked it. There were some childish jokes which is expectable from movies like this but they were not that often. I usually like animations but I am picky with my favorites. This movie was perfect for me and it is up there if you are hesitant to watch like I was definitely give it a try."
136,Home,,15 March 2015,Smek-tacular,"In a vivid and hugely entertaining outing from Dreamworks, ""Home"" combines a fantastic science-fiction world with a heart-warming tale of unlikely friendshipand enough bubbles to soak a spaceship. Jim Parsons (best known as Sheldon from The Big Bank Theory) voices lovable alien Oh - a disastrously clumsy member of the Boov race, who come to earth and displace its human population in order to make the planet their own hiding place. The Boov, best known for their cowardly attributes, are on the run from a formidable-looking enemy, but when Oh invites everyone to his house-warming party, he accidentally sends the E-vite to the entire galaxy (seriously, why would they put the ""Send"" button right next to ""Send To All""?). Becoming public enemy #1, Oh goes on the run from his own people, hoping to find escape in Antarctica, after fantasising about a group hug with a bunch of penguins! However, Oh bumps into Tip (voiced by Rihanna), a young girl who has managed to elude the Boov invaders whilst searching for her mother. The two social misfits team up, and through their amazing adventures, discover the meaning of finding Home. The opening ten minutes of Home promise a fantastic premise which is utterly engrossing - the idea that the human population could so easily be ejected from their own home into a land of ice cream and picket fences, whilst the invading alien force sets up shop is genius. A truly sci-fi animation caper would be greatly appreciated across all ages, and the scope for imagination is enormous. However, where the story journeys to is a little flat in comparison, relying on a typical buddy-road-trip formula with added modifications - such as a car completely transformed by items you would find in a grocery story (there is even a lottery-ticket dispenser, how awesome would that be?).That being said, Home is absolutely delightful to watch. The slapstick comedy is pitch-perfect, and some of the characters are excellently developed - in particular Captain Smek (voiced by the legend Steve Martin), whose firm leadership of the Boov people is undermined by his ridiculous fascination with human artefacts (such as bubble-wrap and a wheel-barrow). Jim Parsons delivers a wonderful vocal-performance as Oh, in particular a scene where he involuntarily dances along to human pop-music which proves Dreamworks can still provide animated gold. Colour is used with splendid ferociousness, especially the Boov who change colour when feeling different emotions. The visual depth is not only great to watch, it also adds pathos to their characters in an ingenious way. The music will appeal to the younger generations, and acts as a sales pitch for both Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez (who voices Tip's mother), whose songs populate the movie like an everlasting bubble machine of pop-tastic ooze. Although, on balance, the original music which is provided by Lorne Balfe creates some entrancing and moving moments in the film, with its enriched emotive score. A wonderfully imaginative and genuinely funny film then, Home is Dreamworks' proof that they can still compete in the razor-sharp leagues of animation. What could have been a five-star film had they continued with a stronger premise, is still a hugely enjoyable family film that lands a lot of laughs, and boasts a bunch of bubbly brilliance."
137,Home,3,9 January 2016,For ages 4 and under only.,"""Home"" is a terribly misguided CGI movie from Dreamworks. While it could have been a nice film featuring a black protagonist (a first for this sort of movie), instead it's simply a chore start to finish to watch unless you are too young to realize you're watching crap! The film is extremely colorful (to the point of being a bit garish) but the CGI is nice...but the story and characters are about as welcome as gum disease!When the film begins, the 'nice' aliens, the Boov, come to Earth and kidnap all the humans and drop them in a tiny portion of the globe and keep the rest for themselves. This might have worked if the Boov were supposed to be malevolent and evil...but they are supposed to be kind of charming! Well, they aren't very nice at all and they speak in a backwards/mixed up manner that immediately becomes tedious.Somehow in this new hellish Earth, the Boov missed one...a young girl voiced by an adult. She meets up with THE most annoying Boov and they have adventures. Adventures with the most annoying character from a selfish and jerk-ish race...what's not to love?!! Well, pretty much everything. The bottom line is that the characters are unlikable and the way they talk simply annoying...and after a while I simply had to stop because the film was unwatchable for anyone older than about 4 or 5. Awful...and inexplicably bad."
138,Home,5,27 May 2015,Bad role models,"The animation, pace and dialog were of a high quality. At times this is a genuinely funny film. BUT there are too many clichés, redemption monologues that you want to fast forward through and little suspense. That aside my main complaint is that the female lead represents such a poor role model that I don't think this can be classed as a family film and so misses it's intended mark. The film's star, Gratuity, lashes out at her counterpart 'Oh' as if he were a comedy punch bag. Is it OK to be violent when you're upset? Is it OK to be unkind, rude and aggressive to those weaker than yourself? I watched it with my young daughter and really thought it set a bad example in terms of behavior. I've seen this recently with other films that try to have sassy urbane child heroes. I must sound like a Daily Mail reader but I didn't think it appropriate for young viewers."
139,Home,3,11 July 2016,"Good music video, Uninspired and stale movie","DreamWorks Animations film 'Home' feels rushed and underdeveloped. Despite the delayed release, 'Home' barely holding a candle to the intended franchise potential of previous DreamWorks Spring releases such as 'The Croods' and ""How to Train Your Dragon'. This is mainly due to the uninspired script, bland two-dimensional characters, and the overbearing use of Rihanna's 8 original soundtracks segueing almost every scene. The film attempts to project individual concerns and hardships onto a new and interesting alien protagonist, Oh, through his continued ostracisation and inability to make friends. However, from the start of the film every detail about Oh's personality and character traits are spelled out through the unnecessary insight given by his narration, removing any subtlety in the character and spoon-feeding the audience. While I understand that the film must cater to the younger target demographic, the studio's tactics of delivering information to the audience seem simplistic and uninspired as the film spells out literally every detail about the characters and events, consequently allowing the audience to guess exactly what will happen for the next 5 minutes of any scene. As if the cookie-cutter scaffold of the film isn't enough, the excessive use of upbeat and lyrical soundtracks during every scene makes almost any character emotions null and redundant, as their connection to each other is dependent on the soundtrack propelling the story and character development, rather than the motivations of the characters in relation to the over-arching plot. All in all, this movie is lazy, uninspired, and overly-dependent on Rihanna's 8 original soundtracks in order to market and shape the story."
140,Home,1,26 March 2016,Waste of time! Watch paint dry its more entertaining than this.,"What a bag of garbage this film is! Hate the main actor and actress who voice over this, it made it very annoying to watch. I just feel like it was a film to promote the singer Rihanna. A song of hers gets played every 10 minutes in this film it is ridiculous. The plot is rubbish and me and my little sister were extremely bored watching it, watching paint dry would have been more fun for us both than wasting our time on this rubbish ! I do not recommend watching it unless you cant put up with an annoying voice and rubbish plot. Would not waste your time we turned this off half way through as it annoyed us so much we could not bare it."
141,Home,5,8 January 2016,"Fun, but lazily written","Well I just watched home. I expected a horrible film, but what I got was a fun film with likable character but awful plot, music and directing.While I thought the film was fun and I did care about the characters, the plot made no sense, and what just un-interesting. The music also really annoyed me. It was basically one giant music video. And some of those songs REALLY didn't fit certain scenes.I also thought the directing was just un-inspiring and just average and in some scenes, bad.Although I mostly liked the voice acting, the main girl did sound too old for her age and at times Rihanna's performance was a bit stale. Jim Parsons was really good though, as the alien species Boov.Overall not a good film. But not completely awful. Pleasantly surprised actually. Expected to give it a very low rating, but my rating is 5/10"
142,Home,8,19 December 2015,"Fun, with a fault.","Personally, I really enjoyed this movie with one major exception: the music. Using a bunch of Rihanna's songs, especially with repetition of the same song, was incredibly distracting and annoying. Otherwise, I think it's well done and can appeal to almost any audience. We have a protagonist who is misunderstood, earnest, and funny (Oh). We have another protagonist who is heartfelt, compassionate, and courageous (Tip). Their dynamics are interesting and compelling. Tip's relationship evolution with her mother is touching and meaningful. The end had me literally sobbing, and I watched the encounter between Oh and the Gorg multiple times, it was so well done and emotional. This movie truly made me think about my life and how people interact with each other. Plot 10/10 Characters 10/10 Unpredicatability 10/10 Music 2/10 Overall 8/10If I could just change the music this movie would be nearly perfect."
143,Home,6,28 July 2015,Interesting Script could have delivered in better way,"Script of film is not new, as we have watching through many of Hollywood films, But expected screenplay should have been better. As Animated film, targeted mainly for kids and young-adults, it's boring of seeing main characters are always talkative, which is not expected. Films story contains all possible elements for adventure riding, but in my point of view, it is not utilized completely. Characters in this film left unnoticed without proper introduction and it's purpose. But, nonetheless to say, Kudos to Animation Department where each and every minute particle in this film are crystal clear and good. In total, a film with very interesting script, but could have delivered in better way !"
144,Home,9,12 August 2015,Kidults & tiny monsters will love it,"Dreamworks stuff. I'm the very definition of Kidult and I don't understand grown-ups that don't share my love for these movies. So if you have an appreciation for them too, listen to me! But I'm not a cranky, judgemental reviewer either so if you want me to dissect a movie apart, please move on to the next review- I watch movies and review them for what they are outright, not for technical aspects and how much what made.Being a huge animated movie fan, I have to admit my biggest reaction upon seeing the trailers was ""meh"", and I passed over it for awhile after it came out. I finally sat down to watch it the other day, and I loved it!! Yet another movie I sincerely regret not seeing in theaters. During the first 10 minutes I thought I might get annoyed by the Boov speak, but found it funnier as the movie went on. I'm not going to claim this is one of the top animated movies of the decade, but it's nothing you should skip! I loved the story line, it steps away from the usual kid plots just enough to keep the interest of an adult, the characters were a lot better than the previews lead on (and I'm definitely not Rihanna's biggest fan, so that's saying something). What got me laughing so much in this movie was the Boov color changes. They change with their moods (I don't think that's a spoiler?) and in one scene he's dancing involuntarily, I was in stitches. Oh and I definitely cried at the end...three times. Anyone that knows me won't be surprised by that, but I was! This is a movie worth watching if your mind is free of pre-judgement and your not a cranky pants. If you don't think this movie is funny, even for a couple of minutes, good luck with your life cuz your nothing but a bunch of sour grapes."
145,Home,10,7 August 2015,This is one of my favorite kid's movies ever!,"I blogged about my feelings from this excellent movie here:http://www.ablisscomplete.com/enjoyin g-uplifting-entertainment/to-be-a- humansperson/Here is part of my review: Dreamworks' Home is one of my new favorite movies of all time. We saw it twice in the theater and have watched it twice at home since it came out on DVD. Every time I watch it, I laugh and cry at the same points. I truly feel the intensity of the characters' emotions, and their journey is one I would take with them over and over.This movie is so real because its characters are real, and it helps remind us what it is like to be a human."
146,Home,10,2 August 2015,Adorable,"This is a wonderful movie. Lots of laughter, touching moments and good concepts. Surprise twists add to the storyline. Overall, made with sensitivity and understanding. Great animation. Can't imagine why there's so much negativity in some of the reviews. Maybe they didn't get it. Or believe they are better equipped at making movies. But it was cute, fun and had some really good lessons for little ones. Heart warming. The music is fabulous too. Jim Parsons delivers as always (what's not to like!) but the real (pleasant) surprise is Rhianna. Colors galore! So glad we got the DVD too, to replay all the fun moments again. Highly recommend."
147,Home,10,25 July 2015,Touching and beautiful family movie,"This is a very good movie, it melts your heart. I had tears in my eyes while watching it, tears of joy and tears of sadness. I am upset with the bad reviews this movie has..I didn't want to watch it at the begging, due to all this bad reviews, but gave it a try and boy it was such a nice surprise. Actually I just finished watching it and I might watch it again right now. And since Minions is out, I must confess, Home is SO much better then Minions, even though I was a huge fan of Minions, but without Gru, Minions have no charm.So go for Home, you will love it, the character, the soundtrack, the lessons"
148,Home,10,26 May 2015,Worth a watch!,"I was going to give this movie a 8 but seeing as how the score is unfairly low I'm giving it a 10 to boost it up. I'm not sure why people are so stuck up about this movie. Is it for the sole reason that Rihanna is in it? I'm not a fan of her work either but people shouldn't let that in the way of enjoying this movie. Dreamworks has created something special here. The highlight is Jim Parsons as the protagonist 'Oh' . He is funny throughout the movie and the character is very likable just as I had previously read on some other reviews. The plot is surprisingly good. It's just plain fun. Sure, you think it's about aliens invading earth..like that hasn't been done before. However, I think that's not the focus here. There's a valuable message in the end of it all and I was satisfied with it. If you enjoy animated movies for their lightheartedness and just need to put a smile on your face I guarantee you this movie can deliver. A lot of people nowadays just want serious, mature, gore infested movies but they forget that they were also kids one day and movies like these never get old even if we do."
149,Home,4,28 March 2016,Its OK,"This movie is OK. The plot is pretty strait forward: find Tip's mom. Its laid out pretty good but it sometimes doesn't make sense. The animation is good. Its voice actors are good. The writing is OK. I know what some of you will say ""its because its animated"" or "" its just a kids movie."" but that still doesn't count, there a lot of good animated/kids movies out there like Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, How to train your dragon 2, or The Incredibles. So don't say that about animated kids movies. But other than that, I'm sorry but thats really all I can say about this film, its just OK. I can't think of anything else but IMDb has a minimum of 10 lines of text in a review, so ya........"
150,Home,6,7 December 2015,A Mediocre but enjoyable Children's film,"Home is a children's/family film about a race of Aliens who always run away from there problems, in this case another race of warlike beings, and flee to Earth, where they displace the human population and settle down. Oh (played by Jim Parsons, of Big Bang Theory fame) is a clumsy alien who accidentally alerts his peoples enemies of there new home, and is hunted down by his own people in order to be erased. He escapes, however, with the help of Tip (played by Rihanna of music fame), a young human girl who was separated from her mother during humanities displacement. Together, the two pair up and go on an adventure across the globe in order to find Tip's mother, and clear Oh's name, all while being hunted by Earth's new inhabitants.Here is what I enjoyed. The premise to this film is pretty simple, and provides some interesting family-friendly science fiction that is surprisingly enjoyable. Some of the aliens and their spacecraft are well conceptualized and interesting. The thought that went into the design of the aliens is well done. Another plus is the relationship between Tip and Oh. They develop their relationship in a fairly well written series of adventures, where they come to rely on each others skills, abilities and company. The story itself is interesting enough to be watchable for an adult, and definitely appropriate for the kids to sit through and enjoy. There are some laughs to be had for all age groups, and the heart warming moments are sometimes adequate to not feel entirely forced or fake. Finally, the animation for this film is often quite well done. There is a particular scene in the ocean that was quite breathtakingly animated.Here is what I did not enjoy. Jim Parsons and Rihanna are both talented individuals, judging by their success on television and in the music scene, respectively. However, they do not bring their A-game to Home. Both parts often feel forced. Both Tip and Oh are a bit annoying, especially the Tubsy-Wubsy cuteness that Oh's character regurgitates regularly. Another downside was sometimes the overall story. Although interesting, it was never truly engaging, and in the era of amazing children's films like Up, the Lego Movie or Frozen, Home falls well short of interesting and falls within the mediocrity category. The story often jumps around through montages, with a Rihanna song playing in the background (the obvious corporate shilling of Rihanna's music is not subtle, but I won't subtract points for it). It seems the film was also written with mediocrity in mind as well. This is a story we have all seen before, with two supposed enemies getting together and learning to understand their differences, and rely on each others friendship and strength. This is a cookie cutter children's plot, and is in no way original or refreshing.Concluding thoughts: This is a mediocre and watchable children's film that is enjoyable enough to sit through. The kids will get a kick out of it, and the adults in the family may find something to like as well. There is good clean humour, interesting animation and a passable story to keep you watching. However, the films mediocrity scores no points, and by the end you might feel like you've seen this all before. And you may be considering punching Oh in his cutsy-wootsy face. All in all, this is the definition of a mediocre family film, but may be worth a watch for a few chuckles and a passable story."
151,Home,9,15 November 2015,Silly things does have meaning <3,"Some quotes and silly jokes does lighten up the movie. I think this movie wasn't meant to be taking seriously, it was meant to be silly. But the most important things, from my perspective, everything in the movie is a metaphors to being human.When I first watched it, the only that was on my mind was ""This is really funny"". I found it pretty interesting so I decided to show it to my three years old cousin. Re-watched it with her more than twice, and I started to realized what the movie was all about. It was beautiful and amazing to be honest.Home is by far my favorite movie."
152,Home,6,21 August 2015,Rhiana Sing Along Movie,"This is just another run of the mill Animated Movie - it entertaining but in no way would I consider this film memorable, even the kids we took with us couldn't really begin to explain exactly which part of the film they enjoyed. I must say Rihanna sings well, but after 5 songs it was just getting to be Rihanna the musical for me.The plot was a little weak even for the kids, I mean anybody I guess over the age of about 10 would be able to figure out what was going to happen. So lets just say it relies on its beautiful animation lots of bright colours and cheesy songs to keep the really young kids entertained but not for the older ones."
153,Home,3,9 August 2015,Didn't really work from an adults point of. 3/10,"Review: This is definitely one for the kiddies! The jokes are pretty weak at that Oh character becomes pretty annoying after a while. Its about an alien race, the Boov's, who take over earth so they can escape the evil Gorg. The Boov's spend time reorganising earth by getting rid of things that they find useless, whilst Oh is struggling to find friends and is unable to fit in with his fellow Boov's. Tip, voiced by Rihanna, manages to escape from the Boov's with her cat and she is finding it hard to cope with the fact that they had taken her mum. She then bumps into Oh, who is on the run because he sent out an invitation for his party, to the whole of the Boov colony which will blow there cover and eventually reach Gorg. Oh and Tip then end up on a mission to find Tips mum and save Oh's planet. I did find the jokes more silly than funny and it was extremely corny in parts. There's not that much material for adults and it amazed me how intelligent Oh turned out to be towards the end. On the plus side, the animation does look great and the attention to detail is impressive but I found myself cringing through most of the film. Don't get me wrong, it's the perfect movie for keeping the kids quiet because they will definitely love it but from an adults point of view, it just didn't work for me. Average!Round-Up: I've always found Jim Parsons voice pretty annoying, after watching a few episodes of the Big Bang Theory and you really can tell that they modelled the Oh character around his mannerisms and weird one liners. He was a good choice to play Oh but it just became a bit too much after a while. There wasn't that much to Rihanna's character (Tip) but I did giggle when Captain Smek (Steve Martin) was using earth things, like a hoover and a hair dryer, in the completely wrong way. Anyway, the movie was directed by Tim Johnson who also made Antz, Over The Hedge, Sinbad: Legend of the Seas and Kung Fu Panda Holiday. Because of the time that it takes to makes these animation movies, I'm not surprised that he hasn't made that many but he has made enough profit from this film and Antz, to bank roll other projects in the future. Although this movie wasn't for me, it's great for a family day out and it's harmless fun for all ages.Budget: $135million Worldwide Gross: $390millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/comedies about an alien who is on the run from his own people and a human who is searching for her mum. 3/10"
154,Home,7,17 July 2015,Just above Average,"Home is a simple animation comedy which will give you some smile in the end and will become a favorite of your kids. Nothing more. A usual animation comedy which talks about the value of relationship and bonds. This is a story of Boovs, tiny alien creatures (Right now am hating Minions for introducing these kind of creatures to Hollywood) who invades the Earth by evacuating Humans and relocating them to other area. A boov named ""Oh"" is on run from the Boov Police and finds a girl with her pet looking for her mom and they together start their journey in search of her mother. Movie will give you some laughs but it is simple plain. As i said earlier its for kids and its not much enjoyable for an adult. One time watchable My rating : 6.8"
155,Home,9,5 July 2015,Oh My God! Dreamworks was rights!,"I just wanna start off by saying I did not enjoy this movie, terrible plot, annoying forgettable characters and awful dialogue. This is coming from someone who loves all of dreamworks animations and honestly prefers them to Disney crap. When every one was getting excited over frozen I was laughing my butt off and having fun watching turbo!But it comes down to what dreamworks said after Mr. peabody and sherman didn't do well financial-wise, people don't want smart and intelligent shows,Mr. peabody and Sherman was too intelligent for the audience... or something like that. so their answer was to make HOME, a bad grammar, terrible plot, thoughtless character design animation... and they love it!Nice one dreamworks! your deserve a 10/10 for that, but i'll give a 9 because I really didn't like it. And please go back to making smart movies."
156,Home,7,30 March 2015,Good one,"Jim Parsons brings his the persona from. The Big Bang theory that made him a small screen star in voicing the character of Oh, an awkward alien trying to make friends and finds one in Tip an earth girl played by Rihanna. Parsons and RiRi radiate chemistry, despite it only being their voices on the screen. The animation was not that impressive, but the story was really good. I don't know about Dreamworks Classic here, but It was a good, funny animated feature to see with your family.I would recommend not seeing it in 3D, it's not that good."
157,Home,7,28 August 2015,Cute Alien Takeover,"Earth has been invaded by a benign, altruistic race of yellow-bellies known as ""boov"". In their attempts to hide from their nemesis they inhabit Earth and displace all humans. The Boov think that all of their problems are solved except for the clumsy, well-intentioned nuisance: ""Oh"" (Jim Parsons).If the movie is anything it is very kid friendly (unless you happen to believe that Rihanna songs don't belong upon child eardrums). The Boov are a cute race of aliens with a penchant for mixing up their words in a Yoda-like fashion. The humor all seems to be especially for kids whereas many animations tend to throw some adult humor in there just to keep the parents happy.The story was decent enough but the acting was bland. You may wonder what kind of acting is there in an animation; it's in the voice. Jim Parsons holds his own but Rihanna sounds like she's reading a script. Still, I'd recommend this movie for a family night out."
158,Home,7,26 August 2015,Two unlikely friends in an unexpected adventure.,"It was a good movie, but just like 'Turbo', it was turned down by the critics and so those who follow them. Besides Disney and Pixar, DreamWorks Animation ain't that bad at all. Technical side of this film comes under same league with the other two top production house, but the story and the character are not strong enough. Comedies were awesome, and so the dialogues, the innovation in narration falls short with the same old cliché in the alien theme. The soundtracks were good though, especially that one used for the promotion, 'feel the light'.For a change, the lead girl character was different and voice rendered by Rihanna. I said it many times that my first ever 3D animation was 'Ants', despite 'Toy Story' was the first feature length. And this film has been the best work of the director to till date since his first flick 'Antz'. As usual like any animated movie, it was targeted for children, but I enjoyed watching it. There won't be a sequel at least for now, but I would love to have one. For a change you can try this to get a break from the fairy tales and princess stories.6.5/10"
159,Home,,11 August 2015,Good choices of character voices.,"I like all the actors who voice for this animated movie and they all are good here, although it took me a few minutes to get the image of Sheldon (""Big Bang Theory"") out of my mind whenever Jim Parsons delivered his lines. After I did I found him a great choice for the main character, a little alien named Oh.Oh and all the others like him have decided to take over Planet Earth for themselves, in a completely non-violent way. They simply suspend the force of gravity for a time, vacuum up all the Earthlings, then deposit them in idealistic prefab villages.This of course causes problems for most Earthlings but in particular the singer Rihanna as Gratuity 'Tip' Tucci. She has been separated from her mother, Jennifer Lopez as Lucy, and she needs to enlist the help of Oh to locate Lucy.The other famous voice is Steve Martin as alien Captain Smek. He is fine, nothing special though.I found this on DVD from the public library and was prepared to be disappointed. It seems most animated features over the past few years just don't work very well. However not only was I NOT disappointed, I found it to be a very charming and entertaining 90 minutes. And the sound track is very good also."
160,Home,10,7 July 2015,An  Excellent movie with Amazing soundtrack !! I  loved it.,"It was a very great dream works picture don't care about bad reviews.Must watch film of the year.A great story with great voice acting especially Rhianna's character.It was way more entertaining than inside out (which was not so great)and Epic (2013).This is a great animation,adventure and comedy movie.I love all the scenes IN MOVIE which are wonderfully designed,the adventure is pleasing and the comedy is totally entertaining.The movie was from the beginning great and not only for kids.It is a GOOD ENTERTAINING movie for all ages.One of the most greatest film of the year.I recommend Home to anyone who wants to go out and have a great time."
161,Home,8,5 July 2015,Delightfully Heartwarming and Innocently Introspective,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsA surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous animated, sci-fi comedy. The combination of ""Home's"" layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.When Oh, a lovable misfit from another planet, lands on Earth, and finds himself on the run from his own people, he forms an unlikely friendship with an adventurous girl named Tip who is on a quest of her own. Through a series of comic adventures with Tip, Oh comes to understand that being different and making mistakes is all part of being human. And while he changes her planet and she changes his world, they discover the true meaning of the word ""Home"".There's a lot of goofiness, to be sure, much of it having to do with Oh (Jim Parsons) and the Boov's silly syntax. But the film pulls back at points where others might double down. Instead, Tip's (Rihanna) longing for her mother and Oh's longing for acceptance start to weigh more heavily on the plot, and the film gradually captures a sense of gentle, but very real, desperation. Warming hearts and jerking tears are par for the course in kiddie flicks. But it's rare to find one that has this many emotional crescendos, and manages them all gracefully and cinematically. It also probably helps that the film features a wonderful soundtrack, which includes Rihanna's otherworldly ""Towards the Sun"". The song works well, particularly with the finale's images of apocalyptic grandeur. ""Home"" is corny and sentimental at times, but the corniness never feels cheap and opportunistic. More importantly, it's a poignant tale of emotions, the little things that make us truly human, and not bothering to fit into conventional molds."
162,Home,7,21 May 2015,Home is Where the Heart Is.,"Home (2015): Dir: Tim Johnson / Voices: Jim Parsons, Rihanna, Steve Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Matt L. Jones: Animation about appreciation of homes everywhere. The Boov aliens are notorious for running from adversary and seek shelter on planet Earth. They seize human beings in bubbles that rise out of sight and then hope that the Gorg force cannot find them. Jim Parsons of Big Bang Theory fame voices a friendly Boov named Oh, who is delighted when he encounters a girl named Tip, voiced by Rihanna. She has avoided abduction thanks to her cat being on her head, and she searches for her mother, who was abducted. She realizes that Oh is good natured but fails to realize that he isn't popular amongst his race. This occurs when he sends invitations to his house party but the Boov leader fears that the Gorg will receive this and know their whereabouts. Director Tim Johnson has made superior animations with Sinbad and the Seven Seas and Antz but he achieves great success here with animated detail that goes beyond expectations. Despite playing off his sitcom vibe, Parsons provides charm and comic wit voicing Oh, who goes beyond when forging a merge between Boov and Gorg in a great climax. Tip, voiced by Rihanna is cardboard and straight forward. Steve Martin steals the film voicing the flamboyant Boov leader whose motto is to retreat. Jennifer Lopez as Tip's mother is as lifeless as her role in the dreadful Boy Next Door. Matt L. Jones voices Kyle, the police Boov. While hardly demanding, families will appreciate the colourful animation and theme that drives home facing fears. Score: 7 / 10"
163,Home,9,5 September 2015,Super Home with friends,"This movie is hilarious, no doubt. I don't know why many people didn't liked it? First of all this movie is completely filled with ultimate and creative animation, secondly, this movie is touching in the sense of simple relationship with alien as a friend. The talking expression of aliens is so humorous and funny, that I was simply stuck in admiring Boov and his colleagues. The traveling and historical monuments make this movie a boon. The story line is very predictable and straight, but, the movie is well made to be loved by every child and elders. The last Gorg is so nice and adorable when actually comes into vision in the end. Boov's party scene is rock solid with excellent soundtrack of Rihanna. I liked the way Boov smiles and speaks so confidentially with scientific and intellectual talk, that gives complete meaning and powerful adventure. I will really remember this movie."
164,Home,10,30 August 2015,Awesome!!,"I absolutely love it!! The music is great and I love Jim parsons acting he's so funny!! I've been watching him on The Big Bang Theory which is my favorite show and when I found out he was in this movie I knew I definitely had to watch it!! It is definitely way better than the book. I read the book after I watched the movie and I felt like the movie was better. It had a different story and the movie is more interesting. And the song ""dance in the dark"" is such a great song. I listen to it all the time and watch the movie almost every day. It's amazing!! It's one of my favorite movies. Rihanna isn't the greatest actress in the world but she was okay in this one. Oh is so adorable and lovable!!"
165,Home,,30 July 2015,Not Great but It's Entertaining,"Home (2015) ** 1/2 (out of 4) An alien colony escapes from their planet when another evil alien group is about to attack. The aliens travel to America where they take over the planet and send the human creatures away. Oh (Jim Parsons), a nice but friendless alien, ends up on the run and teams up with a young girl (Rihanna) looking for her mother.HOME isn't up to the standards of Pixar but for the most part it's a pleasant entertainment that children and their parents should enjoy. I think the majority of the charm has to go to the alien creatures as their design was quite good and made for a lot of fun and especially the Oh character. He was certainly extremely well-written and Parsons had no problems in bringing this to life. Then there's Rihanna voicing the young girl and she too is good. Steve Martin makes for a good dummy and there's also Jennifer Lopez in support.The film has some nice animation throughout but at the same time one wishes that the story itself was a little better. There are some mild chuckles throughout but there wasn't anything too funny here. Again, it's not a classic and I'm sure it'll eventually be forgotten but it's a decent time killer."
166,Home,7,17 July 2015,Home wins,"For the first 3-D animation with a black female lead, this was a success. It was funny, heartwarming and I thought Rihanna and Jim Parsons had great chemistry.After seeing A Normal Heart, I realised that Jim was a great actor with so much potential if he's not doing his usual Big Bang Theory schtick.He shows another dynamic here that was funny and cute.Rihanna did great in her first lead role.Is this the greatest animation of all time? Does it hold a candle to Finding Nemo and Incredibles? No, but Hollywood has half-pulled their finger out of their ass and are attempting to give us more diverse stories.If I had a daughter, I would show her this before anything Pixar has ever done... Well done Dreamworks. Kinda."
167,Home,7,11 April 2015,Great movie but musically ruined,"I just finished watching this movie and I have to say it was brilliant. I would be more than happy to see it again however i am disappointed with the overall music in the film. Using Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez's music throughout the film seemed more like a lame promotional tactic for their albums than anything else and I believe the situations created within the film deserved a more fitting musical selection. Although the music was a little unforgivable in my point of view, it hardly hinders the quality of the movie and I would recommend it to anyone."
168,Home,4,6 July 2015,The Vidiot Reviews...,"Home  If aliens hope to stay in America undetected they had better not  disguise themselves as Mexicans.  Surprisingly, the immigrating ET's in this animated movie opted for no  disguises.  Searching for a home after fleeing their planet due to a conflict with  the monstrous Gorg, Captain Smek (Steve Martin), leader of the Boov  species, proposes they live on Earth.  Imprisoning the humans, the Boov move into their homes and begin to  live their life anew. That is until an absentminded Boov, Oh (Jim  Parsons), sends out a party invite that reaches Gorg.   Teaming with a human girl (Rihanna) in search of her mother (Jennifer  Lopez), Oh hopes to abate Gorg's attack and rejoin his race.  While the inarticulate aliens are an annoyance, it's the rambling  montages featuring Rihanna songs that really ruin this middling movie.  Furthermore, all extraterrestrials are welcome on Earth as long as they  pay the billion-dollar visitor tax.   Red Light"
169,Home,6,5 July 2015,Not the Best - Not a Failure,"Home is a an average plot, character animation and storytelling movie. The nice colors, the action,the places,the humor,the music,the deep-emotionally rich- characters and the strong,powerful message make Home totally recommended for young kids. However, the simplicity and predictability of the plot make Home sometimes a bit boring. The plot is very fast, resulting in some storytelling gaps at the characters' development and their journey. Rihanna's acting skills were poor. However, Jim Parsons, with his excellent acting skills as Oh, saved the day! In conclusion, it's definitely not an asset to Dreamworks studios. But this does not indicate that Home is a failure."
170,Home,7,4 July 2015,"Why Rihana , why ????","Too much Rihana , that is overall impression. They spoiled movie with promotion of her,her songs,Barbados, ""family stuff"" , like the movie is made for her. So LAME , like annoying commercials.Sometimes, less is moreJames Parsons is a star in this movie , worth watching because of his voice, and good animation. Also very good facial expression of Boov ,nailed it with changing color by mood. Story is not so bad.Thanks you for almost 10 movie I really wanted to ""see"" more James in this kind of animations,his voice is really uniqueOverall 7 for story, 10 for animation, 1 for too much Rihana , 10+ for James"
171,Home,8,18 June 2015,Near-perfect family movie,"Dreamworks never manages to disappoint with its beautiful animated films, and Home is another it can add to the trophy case alongside Kung Fu Panda, Shrek, How to Train Your Dragon, and Madagascar.The all-star cast bring such life to the characters, and the animations hold up so much emotion even without the voices that it's easy to get lost in the story. I even found myself tearing up at the end.Jim Parsons makes a perfect Oh; the lovable and intellectual, but confused Boov. His voice is unfortunately very recognisable; and this is certainly a type-cast for him.On the other side of the screen; Rihanna brings such a wide range of emotion to Gratuity ""Tip"" Tucci; it's impossible to not fall in love with the young protagonist, and feel true empathy for her as the plot unfolds.The story itself offers several moral lessons, and while they're reinforced; they're also not blunt. Other methods of communicating the story - such as the Boov changing colours to match their own moods and emotions; are both incredibly creative and clever, but also allow even small children to follow the story easily, without bland dialogue telling the audience what they should be able to see.In the end; this is definitely a movie I would recommend, and I would gladly have my kids watch it over and over, because I know I would enjoy it just as much as them."
172,Home,5,1 June 2015,"Good characters and a lot of heart, but a predictable plot and silly jokes let it down","Home follows Oh and Tip played by Jim Parsons and Rihanna (didn't think i would ever hear those two names in one sentence) as they travel across the earth on adventures of their own. Now although this wasn't a very great film it was still an OK film that i didn't hate as much as i thought i would. It actually had a lot of heart and quite a bit of time spent on conveying messages about family and emotions and i didn't mind those sections, the fact that they were able to work them into the film without feeling forced was well done. I also enjoyed seeing Oh and Tip interact, their relationship was an interesting one, there were times where it was pretty silly but also some pretty entertaining stuff that they go through that keeps you awake. Now apart from the characters and a pretty good soundtrack (with its fair share of Rihanna songs) there really wasn't anything else that good about the film. I mean, you can't expect a whole lot being a film directed towards kids but the plot still has to be a good one. It was very predictable and at times it got a little slow, there was one point half way through the film where it looked as though it was ending because they had done almost everything they set out to do and then the film realised it had only been 50 minutes so they figured out how to extend it for longer. Being a little more creative with the story could have benefited the film slightly. What else would have greatly benefited the film was the comedy, you can kinda imagine the comedy you are going to get having Jim Parsons as the quirky, weird guy but pretty much all of the comedic elements were very silly and obviously done only for the kids. There were a couple of moments that made me chuckle but only a couple, and the lack of laughs was a big disappointment. In the end, the characters and pretty good relationships were not enough to completely save this film as the plot and jokes were too predictable and silly and that took some of the fun out of the film. So if you've got kids they will probably get something out of it, but i don't think there is much in this for anyone over like 13. - 5/10"
173,Home,7,24 April 2015,Way Better Then I Expected To Be.,"After the humongous flop Penguins of Madagascar, Dreamwork's next film I thought was going to be another All Style No Substance film where stupid slapstick happened and the characters say stupid things and are very unlikable. But it is not the case with Home, which is a much smarter film then The Croods, Penguins of Madagascar and Shrek Forever After.An Alien Race known as the Boov take over Earth after running away countless times from their enemy, they put all the people on Australia and take over 98% of the Earth. After a misfit Boov named Oh (Jim Parsons) accidentally sends an invite to a party to everyone in the universe, he is a fugitive. He also meets Tip (Rihanna) who is a teenage girl who managed to escape the Boov. The two go on the run to find her mother and stop the invitation from getting mailed.It certainly is not a original movie. It is reminiscent in the sense of Lilo And Stitch and other movies involving Aliens befriending Humans, but there is something charming about this alien race. Mostly for their cowardice, which is amusing, but I think it's the character of Oh because of his language. His internet jargon is so fun to listen to and Parsons makes the role great.I was also surprised by Rihanna in this film, her voice acting work is really good. She pulls off the teenage girl shtick quite well.The animation and 3D is great. I mean, really great. The character designs are unbelievable. So much originality to the alien race, how they change color when they show their emotions and how the other race that is trying to get the Boov is so imaginative. In the end, you will not believe how amazed I was with what they actually look like.Of course, it's not without flaws, predictability and low brow humor is in this of course, trying to impress young kids which worked with the audience I saw with. It's not necessarily funny, but I learned that a animated movie or comedy like Last Vegas doesn't have to be hilarious in order to enjoy it. But other than that, I liked it and maybe after a second viewing which I plan on doing, I might even love it. But for now, I'll just give my original rating to this film. Home is a good film for young kids and even older people.72/100 B-"
174,Home,6,15 April 2015,Confusing trailers but interesting film,"The movie started with short history of the Boov's adventures to find a home, which basically is the short film released a few years ago, but the film itself is different from what the marketing made it out to be.From the trailers and the short film, I thought that Oh (Jim Parsons) was running from his fellow Boov - which he is - after making one too many mistakes and landed on Earth while he was running away from them, causing all the Boov to come to Earth because they were looking for him but that's not the case. The movie went in a complete different route, either the studio changed the story-line at the last minute or I saw another movie because the trailers was for an alternate movie not the one I saw.So the movie was confusing for a little while but it doesn't change the fact that the Oh and Tip grow on you, the little Boov Oh, like his counterparts, is quirky, a bit silly, and sometimes funny. The Boovs may not be as funny but they are as endearing as the Minions. Home is solely destined for kids though, the jokes and gags are aimed to please them, and after a few minutes you know exactly where the story is going. The message ""accepting people for who they are"" may not be original but for a kids' movie it's never a bad idea to remind them that being different is OK.Home is fun to watch and could be a nice afternoon trip to the movie theaters with your young kids, nieces and nephews. @wornoutspines"
175,Home,9,12 April 2015,"A amazing, beautiful film","Yesterday I went to watch Home expecting to just see a normal Disney movie. Instead, I saw possibly one of the best films I have ever watched. The whole film and storyline was created beautifully. Anyone at any age will enjoy watching Home, and like me, love Oh especially. The characters, music, etc. were all created amazingly. I felt so... In the film, I guess, and I haven't really felt that with a film in a long time.Overall, Home is a magnificent movie for all the family to enjoy together. I would definitely watch Home again, and that visit to the cinema was the highlight of the week."
176,Home,7,5 April 2015,Average Plot but Overall a Moving Tale about Friends and Family,"Home The creation of Boovs seems to be smaller in size, change of color and diverting appearance of the famous Shrek series; the whole thousands millions of Boovs replicate is however another repetitive mistake of the studio since Penguins of Madagascar trying to follow the success of Minions but it turns out to be just within expectation. The story is again the same formulaic of a main character being abandoned, experiencing some great lessons in the middle part, starting to brave itself and finishing happily by becoming the hero of everyone. Overwhelmed by its averageness in term of plot and character developments, the production team has indeed heavily focused in presenting nice, charming and enjoyable electronic pop-style musics throughout the entire film. Dreamworks might have lack in originality, but this simplistic benign alien invasions with rainbows of colors and cuteness is surprisingly a moving tale about friend and family that will certainly melt the hearts of all moviegoers of any age."
177,Home,10,30 April 2015,Very heartwarming,"Very cute film. Boov is a family of aliens, or more so species of aliens. Last year the Animated Short showed that Oh(Parsons), kept making mistakes ""64 mistakes"". He kept blowing up planets that they were to settle on. They found one - Earth. Great music unreal. Not the normal Musical score like Hans Zimmer, but more so pop music. Music suited the film. So great film overall. The film tells the story that the Boov aliens have settled on Earth. They move the Humans to Australia(Of all places - haahah). Oh being the alien in question keeps making mistakes. While trying to make friends, he encounteres a friend Kyle. He sends the invite EVERYONE not just Kyle. Oh states why can't they have the send all button away from Send button etc., etc., So Oh has put them in further danger with Gorg. It is found thou that at the end that Gorg is after something that the Boov or Captain Smek(Martin) stole. So then Oh bump into Tip(Rihanna) which Tip won't let Oh ""into the out now"". because Tip's Mom(Lopez) was taken by Boov. So the film surrounds GOALS by two main characters Oh and Tip. Tip wants to find her Mom and Oh wants to UNDO his mistakes. Tip and Boov bond, when they hang out. During one of which being Oh is too hot, so he jumps into the ocean, Tip gets mad or ""Sad/Mad"" as she got worried. Then another classic scene is when the car has been broken down, Oh learns a VALUABLE lesson in that ""Your mistakes is what makes you human"". He does so when he realises that the mistake BOOV made by stealing the Gorg's yolk(honestly don't know what it is) which we are explained to that Gorg is the LAST of his species and the yolk that Gorg wanted back what was his livelihood etc., etc.,So overall fantastic film, very moving, no doubt especially to those whose adopted or fostered etc., etc., such as myself."
178,Home,7,22 April 2015,The Boov are on the move.,"Jim Parsons and Rihanna are impressive in their animated film debut. If there is a movie you are going to have to be dragged to...this one, you should and will enjoy. The Boov are interstellar nomads; they speak English, but their sentence structure is not well arranged. Their leader, Captain Smek(Steve Martin)excels at running away. And the Boov are running for sure. The Boov are trying to escape their mortal enemy and they pick Earth to make their new home. One major thing is that they will have to move all humans to Australia.Oh(Parsons)is one excited Boov; but he is not very popular, because the rest of the Boov feel he is so unaware of how his manner and innocence is so irritating. Oh will meet a young girl named Tip(Rihanna), who is looking for her mother(Jennifer Lopez)lost in the shuffle of relocation. Oh agrees to help Tip find her mother as long as she helps him hide from his fellow Boov.Animation and color are top notch; the story is sustainable. There is some mild, rude humor...but hey, this flick is fun for everyone. Some of the music featured: ""Dancing In The Dark"" and ""Only Girl In The World"" by Rihanna. And there is ""Feel The Light"" by Miss Lopez.Others lending voices to characters: Brian Stepanek, April Winchell, Matt Jones, Derek Blankenship, Stephen Kearin and Lisa Stewart."
179,Home,9,6 April 2015,Loved it,"I really enjoyed the film. The animation is beautiful and detailed. The main character Tip is a well written and Oh is adorable, they're both quite easy to empathize with and the story is compelling. There are several plot details that I can see striking a chord with a lot of youths like they did with me. The music is great and although it is slightly out of place in the odd scene it is fitting if the fact that the music is frequently being played from the stereo in Tip's car and is accurate to her music tastes. Its also great to see an animated female Poc lead particularly since shes quite young and depicted as a fairly normal kid."
180,Home,8,6 April 2015,"Good, but long","To my surprise, this was actually a good movie. The idea was unoriginal; aliens vs humans (kid version) but the development and characters were pleasing. The events were relatively straightforward and easy to understand, but there was no great lesson to be learned from this movie. Unlike many children's movies, there was no lesson like don't be afraid to achieve your dreams. The movie was funny and 'Oh' was too cute not to love. The girl, whose name I forgot, looked so normal that I felt good and inspired watching her. She was not thin, you will notice that she has some hips and a belly, she wasn't wearing no fancy clothes, just some pants and a flannel shirt, and her hair was an accurate representation of the traditional African hair. It was the first time that I ever seen a girl in a cartoon looking this much like an average girl and I LOVED it. So props to the design team for doing this. They both go on adventure and slowly combat their fears of seeing and exploring new things. This was another thing I loved, they both ventured out to the 'real' world and used their brains to survive instead of doing what their parents taught them to do. My only negative comments are: the movie was too long. It could have been cut down by 20 minutes and have a fantastic movie from start to finish, but there were really long moments that didn't end no matter how much you wished them two. The last thing is the soundtrack, I get that Rihanna is voicing the lead in the movie, but that doesn't mean that they have to use her songs throughout the entire movie. Her songs did not fit the scenes, it was a party scene where all you wanted to do was stand up and dance with the characters but the music made you sit in your seat.Would have been perhaps the best animation of 2015 if they cut it shorter and changed the music, but still a good move and totally worth the watch."
181,Home,8,6 April 2015,Mostly hilarious or sweet if not genuinely heartwarming!,"Home (2015) is surprisingly likable. The vivid animated feature is filled with lovable characters, amazing voice casts and unexpected adventures that are mostly hilarious or sweet if not genuinely heartwarming!Give and take, don't bother about making sense. You should moar beware of Boov English. Ears bleed but all fun! Then, the mental development and progression of an unlikely friendship between two beings alien to each other are also quite admirable and easy to understand because there are plenty of great messages for everyone who watch it!Glad I went to watch it despite I was busy because it is actually so good! Love Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez the most, Pig the Cat and all the adorable starfish-like baby Gorgs!! Oops, sorry for the character spoiler but I think you need this lil spoiler to motivate yourself to go watch it!!"
182,Home,7,11 April 2017,"""Home"" not just for kids","""Let's go see that new movie with the cute alien!"" my girlfriend said as I sighed internally. Animated films are typically not my cup of tea, and out of all the action-packed blockbusters out at the time like ""Kingsman"" and ""Furious 7,"" she had to choose the Sheldon Cooper alien flick. However, in every relationship it is important to strive to make the other person happy, so we went to see the cute alien movieand I was pleasantly surprised by DreamWorks' ""Home."" Jim Parsons stars as Oh, a whimsical, accident-prone alien part of the race known as the Boov. The movie opens with narration from Oh explaining whom the Boov are, how their society works and their current predicament. On the run from the menacing Gorg, the Boov discover and invade the Earth in a friendly fashion, deeming it a suitable place to seek refuge. After transferring the human population to a remote location on the planet, the Boov effortlessly occupy the cities of Earth and add a personal touch to the established human society.Shortly after their arrival, Oh decides to host a party for the other Boov in his apartment. When no one shows up, Oh tries to convince Kyle (Matt Jones), a Boov cop who Oh claims is his best friend, to come to the party. Rather than sending a single invite to Kyle however, he accidentally sends a mass invite to every species in the galaxy, including the Gorg. Already not being liked by his kind for his odd and eccentric nature, this mistake results in Oh becoming a fugitive. While all this is happening, a young human girl named Tip (Rihanna) is driving through the city with her cat Pig after being separated from her mother during the invasion. By chance, Tip and Pig cross paths with Oh as he is fleeing the Boov authorities. Tip has a burning hatred for the Boov because of the invasion, and this is exhibited in her encounter with Oh. However, after realizing that Oh can help reunite her with her mother, Tip reluctantly allows him to travel with her and Pig.The chemistry between Jim Parsons and Rihanna is the driving force behind the story. Oh is adorable. Parsons and the animators do a great job in conveying the positive attitude that characterizes Oh while also subtly showing the underlying sadness that he feels from being an outcast. The gradual shift in Tip's demeanor towards Oh and the friendship that develops between them is also fun to watch. Steve Martin, Jennifer Lopez and Matt Jones also do well in their supporting roles.While the plot is not quite as jumbled as expected, the writing is still the weakest aspect of the film. Oh's narration in the opening minutes throws the audience right into the world of the Boov and the Gorg in an approach that feels slightly rushed and forced. In addition to this, the Boov speak in a broken form of English not alluded to in Oh's monologue at the beginning, which made the first several minutes of the movie puzzling for me. Once you're settled into the film however, you will begin to smile, laugh and possibly cry at the comical, yet moving story unfolding on screen.I have never been a fan of the 3D gimmick. Today it is overused, not used to its full potential and expensive. However, the cinematography in this movie stood out to me particularly because of the way the 3D was utilized in the opening thirty minutes of the film. There is one shot in particular in which the camera weaves in and out of various rooms and a ventilation shaft in a house. This is neat to watch in and of itself, but the 3D feature makes the viewer actually feel like he or she is in the room, flying amidst the clutter and the small corridors in the ventilation shaft.Thanks to a star-studded cast, a fairly cohesive script and effective visuals, ""Home"" is a funny, warm and heart-felt film that will appeal to audiences of all ages. A couple of takeaway points from the experience: never judge a book by its cover, and guys don't be hesitant to let the lady choose the movie every once and a while, she just might surprise you."
183,Home,8,23 March 2017,Much better than expected,"I was watching thinking of another generic average afternoon animation movie, which is good itself, but to my surprise it was an amazing film, the two main actors did a great job and the film was interesting all over for me.I had a great time"
184,Home,10,3 December 2016,Underrated,"This film has everything an animated film is supposed to have. There are moral lessons to learn. It has emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, desperation and courage. It's about friendship and family.It's colorful, exciting and humorous.I loved it, the kids loved it and I would definitely watch it again.If it comes to the story line, it might be more appealing to the older kids from the age of 7, they can relate. The colors and the cuteness of the Boovs will grab the attention of the younger kids as well.Jim Parson is perfect for Oh. It has the same innocent ignorance to feelings as Sheldon does and it is very endearing to watch him discover all these complex feelings that make us human.Unfortunately, the story doesn't leave room for a second film. It has one story to tell and no characters that could go on to feature in their own story. The film doesn't leave you wondering about ""what next?"". That is the only downside about this clean cut animation."
185,Home,10,18 November 2016,Way better than i heard to be honest..,"An alien on the run from his own people makes friends with a girl. He tries to help her on her quest, but can be an interference. Home was such a great film and i don't get the hate for it it was funny, touching and had a lot of adventure and even if the film has Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez that doesn't mean it sucks every character in this film had it's moments even the cat at some point. It's not on the same level as Shrek for instance but it's not a bad film i liked the characters, the action was good and the soundtrack was great and if you give it a chance and judge it for your own you won't be disappointed just don't expect anything more than just a good animated film and Home will deliver!!"
186,Home,10,28 February 2016,The movie Disney should have made,"Once upon a time... Disney made wonderful movies for children and children at heart, then greed for money took over and they bought the franchise of an old rival at the box offices: Star Wars, not minding that Star Wars is NO proper stuff for children, however with this takeover Disney turned this violent universe into one for children who have to watch mutilations etc. now. Why this prologue? Because HOME is the movie that Disney should have made instead. This is the perfect movie for children (and adults/) and families, a great colorful fun ride with heart, a great message, an incredibly cute alien, a cute pig-cat, a lot of creative ideas and pictures, and some welcome criticism of a recklessly conquering mindset. Dreamworks has surpassed Disney, because they remembered what is important. Hooray to Oh and Hooray to Dreamworks!"
187,Home,7,6 February 2016,Chappy Watched: Home,"Didn't really have any expectations about this film, most animated films can be predictable and repetitive.Luckily Home is entertaining enough that you just don't care.The animation is smooth and very colourful, the characters and voice actors match up seamlessly. As well as Rihannas voice being very distinctive in the movie so is her music  I think I counted five of her songs throughout the movie and it wasn't her character singing them.Jim Parsons character of Oh is pretty much Sheldon Cooper in animation form.It was an entertaining and funny film, one that I could watch again.CHAPPY THINKS that he can't wait for the sequel; Home 2: Under My Umbrella-Ella-Ella-Eh-Eh- Eh! (Get it?!?) :D"
188,Home,10,5 December 2015,high or not this is a great movie,"10 out of 10 yes i am high in the sky on some good stuff here in Holland enjoying this movie i am 18 years old but this movie doesn't need an age! its not only for young also for adults, i also want to say this is such an fun movie very excellent i think i will watch it for like 10 times you will enjoy the movie god bless you America i love Obama this movie is the best movie I've ever seen and i will watch it for many more years in my life and when i get children i will show it to them good day everyone i hope this review helped :) and also compliments to the owner of this site because it is very modern and simple but so professional to use even for people who aren't speaking great American or English language"
189,Home,7,28 November 2015,Quirky and adorable,"I'll be honest here: I'm not a DreamWorks fan. I loved How to Train Your Dragon and Prince of Egypt but the other DreamWorks movies don't really do anything for me. So my hopes weren't too high when I saw the previews for this but I like Jim Parsons and I wanted to support the Dragons franchise so I saw it anyway.This movie was more or less what I expected. And that's not a bad thing. Jim Parsons was fantastic as Oh and really carried the movie, even through some of the slower parts. I personally think the script was clever enough to get some laughs out of adults and kids. The jokes that didn't work weren't painful and the ones that did were quite good. The animation is bright and colorful. The Boov change color when having a strong emotion and the variety of colors was fun to look at and even added a surprising depth to some of the characters toward the end. If you pay attention to Oh in particular, his reactions to certain events can be more entertaining than the events themselves! The amount of detail that went into this movie was impressive.As I said before, Jim Parsons stood out as one of the best things about this film. The passion he puts into the character and the obvious fun he's having shines through. Steve Martin does a great job as well for a lot of the same reasons. I have no complaints about either of them; their performances were pretty much spot on. Unfortunately, Rihanna was a poor choice for Tip, as she simply doesn't sound like she's in her early teens. Her acting is okay but it still felt strange to see her voice coming out of such a young character. I honestly thought Tip was in her early 20s until halfway through the movie! But this is more of a nitpick on my part.The only real complaint I have with this film is the music. The instrumental sections are fantastic and capture the feel of the movie perfectly. But the pop songs are poorly placed and not very interesting. Some of them play in the background of scenes with dialogue, which does nothing to add to the atmosphere and comes off as distracting. Fortunately, such scenes aren't common enough to detract from the story or the acting but I still would have replaced them with instrumental pieces. The biggest problem I have with the music is one scene toward the end in which the dialogue is drowned out so the pop song adds atmosphere. The problem is that this technique rarely works with pop songs. Even then, I would rather have heard the dialogue than Rihanna's attempt to force me to have an emotion.To close, this is one of my favorite DreamWorks movies. Its humor is far less gross or immature than a lot of its predecessors and the voice talents of Jim Parsons and Steve Martin are fantastic. The animation looks beautiful and though it has its flaws, I think that this is a good addition to the DreamWorks library. It knows what it is and it conveys the messages it wants to convey quite well. It's definitely not the best animated movie of the year but considering what DreamWorks has done in the past, it could have been a lot worse. I think 7/10 is more than fair and I would not object to seeing a sequel if it ever gets made."
190,Home,7,19 November 2015,"Decent animation, plot and sort of clever","A race of adorable aliens overcomes Earth and relocates the humans to a small land space in Australia. One endearing misfit causes a calamity and forms an unlikely friendship with an adventurous girl named Tip who is on a quest girl to find her mom. This animation starts off with a fast-paced for the first hour: and is filled with mix emotion between the plot andcharacters development. Once the emotion starts to kicks in, the slow paces plot is accompanied by catchy songs. Still,there's a lot of creativity in the characters designs and originality in the animation arts to appeal the eye of children and audiences of all ages."
191,Home,8,18 November 2015,Home is a heartwarming animation film produced in 2015 about an alien species called 'Boov' who take on planet Earth as their new home.,"What makes this film heartwarming and family-friendly is the way in which it looks at the following themes: acceptance and belonging, loss,growth and a healthy amount of humour. Jim Parsons who acts as 'Oh'brings a lot of humour to his character e.g when instead of saying ""Drop it like it's hot"" he says, ""Drop it like it's a warm temperature."" Personally, I cannot help but compare Jim Parson's character to his other character, Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory. Both appear to be quite knowledgeable with facts and science however, both lack the social skills needed to communicate and form ""normal"" relationships. Although, this is exactly what adds to their quirkiness.I particularly enjoyed the dance scene where Oh starts to dance uncontrollably and because he has no idea what is happening, it is extremely hilarious. The film uses this and other scenes to show different emotions of the boov through color. We see Oh turn many different colors as he dances which shows us just how many different emotions he's feeling: scared, excited, angry, happy etc. The viewer is also able to see when he tells a lie because every time Oh tells a lie, he turns green.In this way, the film also subtly looks at morals e.g lying is wrong and you should put others before yourself. (selfless) Tip and Oh's relationship is rocky at first because they do not trust each other however, as the film progresses and towards the end Oh proves his loyalty to Tip, their friendship develops sweetly.This also proves the saying ""No man's an island"" meaning, we cannot survive alone. We need each other. If Oh hadn't helped Tip, she may never have found her mother. Nor could Oh have ever had the companionship for which he greatly yearned."
192,Home,8,17 November 2015,Oh! The cutest Boov you will meet,"I'm not really a fan of animated films but this movie really got me laughing.In the beginning of the movie we meet such an annoying yet lovable character named Oh. He is everything you don't want as a friend as he constantly makes mistakes without realizing. However when he meets Tip he matures and forms a friendship with her that he doesn't want to let go of.This movie deals a lot with emotions, color and music. We can see how all three are interlinked when the song Cannonball plays and they begin to rekindle their friendship. In this scene we can see how their love and friendship for each other grows. At one point in the song Oh turns pink when thinking of Tip.Definitely an animation worth watching!"
193,Home,8,17 November 2015,"It is a good animation, funny and very education for kids","Home is a great animation,adventure and comedy movie. I am not surprised that it ranked number 1 in most countries around the world and is very famous.After escaping from their enemy, the Gorgs, the Boov have found a new planet to live, which they called'Home' and that is the Earth. Guided by a Captain named Smek, the Boov started their nonviolent invasion on the earth, and relocated the humans to other parts of the planet. And the Boovs moved to live on the earth.In this movie, the sequences and series of incidents are great. The relationship among the characters are very pleasing and educational. The Boovs are very funny as well. This movie is very entertaining.Also, the animated characters and setting are beautiful. I truly recommend this animation for everyone to watch. Oh, and the song of the movie is very good as well. I really love the song, especially when Jennifer Lopez, the famous singer sang it."
194,Home,7,16 November 2015,cutest ever!,"This animation is so entertaining and super awesome. . I enjoyed it so much I had to watch it a second time!I really enjoy watching an animation that has so much colour, detail, humour and most of all cute little creatures as characters. Personally, I think that this movie has so many realism issues and we can definitely learn a lesson or two from it. Kids, adults and even elderly people can sit back and enjoy this fully, jam packed awesome animation. This movie didn't only capture children of 4 to 5 years old, but also looked fun for me as an adult, it truly brings out your inner child; which is what animations aim to do.This is one of the few animations I really enjoyed. I would recommend it to everyone to go an see. Awesome Animation!"
195,Home,9,10 November 2015,Unexpected,"I'm an avid cartoon fan, a huge cartoon fan, I cry in cartoons, it's embarrassing. I turned this movie on not because I was interested in it, but because my son had been saying the word ""Cartoon"" for two and a half hours. I'd seen the previews and I wasn't interested. It looked like many many other funny pet alien movies that had come previous.It looked forgettable. It wasn't, and thinking about it, it looked like they deliberately made the advertising to hide the real theme of the movie away from us.The movie was surprisingly entertaining. I don't think I cried (much) it was no Frozen but it was still really good.My son loved it as well"
196,Home,6,28 October 2015,Good film,"I had not really high expectations on an animated movie, my son would probably enjoy something like this way more than me I thought. Huge Fail. The movie was from the beginning great and not only for kids. It is a feel-good movie for all ages. It is about family , friendship and that being different or just being yourself is not a bad thing at all. I found the movie throughout entertaining and very often funny.The Boov's are just too funny in particular Steve Martin as the voice of Captain Smek, whose firm leadership of the Boov people is undermined by his ridiculous fascination with human artifacts such as bubble wrap . He reminded me partially on King Julien from the Penguins of Madagascar.But even if you are not touched by the great story you will certainly love the Soundtrack. The whole movie was perfectly set and is for me the best Dreamworks movie since a long time. Take your kids and watch it on the big screen, they will love it! and you too, guaranteed.Verdict: A great story meets perfect cast and nothing can go wrong on this alien/ human road trip movie."
197,Home,8,26 October 2015,"Aliens conquer the earth and relocate it's humans, except one girl. An alien outcast and the human develop a friendship and discover the real meaning of the word ""Home"".","This movie has many morals and is shown between the characters interaction throughout the movie. Characters are colorful, cute and funny.The movie sends a positive message about friendship, family, loyalty, hope, conquering your fears and never giving up. It also teachers kids to not just care about themselves, but also others.With a brilliant soundtrack and awesome colors, whats not to like.Very little violence or scariness. A kid friendly movie.It is pretty much okay for all ages.Also good for a family night.Very entertaining with an explosion of rainbow colors and adventure. :)"
198,Home,8,12 October 2015,Home is where the heart lives,"In the animation Home the Booves mission is to find a place of security where they will not be found by the evil Gorg. They over take earth and reallocate the humans to a different vicinity. Home displays the meaning of family and loyalty, tip never gives up on finding her mother Lucy and Boove never gives up in helping her do so. Ironically they follow a leader who teaches them to run away from their fears, where Boove faces them head on and realizes his HOME is where his heart is and that is with Tip. The movie also displays the power of faith and believing in yourself that anything can be achieved. All Booves emotions are displayed and cannot be hidden as they change colour with every emotion so you are able to know exactly what they are feeling. This movie is wonderful for children teaching them values of hope, family, loyalty and perseverance."
199,Home,7,4 October 2015,Boovs or Minions?,"For me, the answer is Boovs. Although many young children find the Spanish-speaking yellow evil midgets adorable, I find them nothing more than annoying and only sometimes-funny. Unlike minions, Boovs can be understood, and have an interesting dialect. Sometimes they are annoying, such as when Oh says, ""My hands are in the air, like I just do not care,"" paraphrasing a famous lyric from a famous song that he hasn't even heard yet, making it irritably coincidental. While the scene in itself is funny, that line received a groan from me instead of a laugh. He also has a horrible potty mouth, and another humorless scene is where he has to ""break pee"", so he goes into the male bathroom, and yells things to Tip in the ladies' bathroom like, ""Ugh, don't eat the blue mint. Luckily there's a bowl full of lemonade. Ugh, do not drink the lemonade."" Not funny in the first place, but what's even worse is that we watch Tip gag into her hands in an overly done melodramatic way. While ""Home"" is a fairly enjoyable animated movie, I must point out that Gratuity ""Tip"" Tucci, the female twelve-year-old protagonist voiced by Rihanna, is somehow a very unlikeable character. Besides the horrible name, Rihanna is one of the worst options to voice her, making her sound way older than a twelve-year-old, and even older than most sixteen-year-olds or eighteen-year-olds. But thankfully, we have wonderful voice acting to contrast that, from Jim Parsons doing a wonderful portrayal of Oh, and Steve Martin also doing a very enjoyable voice for Captain Smek; the two were perfectly cast, and make their characters some of the most enjoyable in animated film history.In the movie the Boovs, the purple alien race that change color according to emotion, have been feeling from the Gorgs, the evil alien race that chases them across the galaxy. The Boovs are prideful in their art of running away, which is why Captain Smek, the best at running away, leads them. So they inhabit earth, sending every human to live in a very crowded Australia. Somehow Gratuity ""Tip"" Tucci (I'll just refer to her as Tip for now) gets left behind, and wants to get her mom back more than anything. Oh, the most obnoxious Boov who is friendless because of his obnoxiousity, accidentally sends an invite to a party to everyone in the galaxy...including the Gorgs. He instantaneously becomes a fugitive, and uses Tip to help flee from the Boov police. But what he doesn't know is that if the Boov could get his password before forty-five hours they could cancel the invite so that the Gorgs wouldn't find them and they'd be peaceful. The rest of the film from there is basically dedicated to Tip and Oh interacting, sometimes in funny moments, sometimes in inspirational moments...or, more correctly, moments that try to be inspirational.What ""Home"" succeeds in is being an entertaining, funny movie with a totally ridiculous plot. The movie falls short in quite a few areas, being utterly annoying sometimes and just un-funny at points. Without Jim Parsons and Steve Martin, this movie could be enormously disappointing...but thanks to a couple of great casting choices, ""Home"" is another bearable children's movie.71.5/100"
200,Home,6,24 September 2015,Exceeded Expectations.,"Jim Parsons and Rihanna. A nerd and an r&b musician. An odd mix. One that's portrayed in Home. It doesn't quite fit well. Parsons voices Oh, the small, purple alien, on the run from his own kind for alerting his race's enemy of a party on earth, where they've taken sanctuary. His voice isn't like the colour of his body, which matches the emotions he's conveying at the time. Not a bad character, just not as cute as the Fox's Minions (if that's what they were going for). Rihanna is Tip, the only human left on earth after the Boov's took everyone off the planet to make it their own. Her only objective is to be reunited with her mother. Her and Oh don't get along at first, but soon become unlikely friends. Rihanna also delivers a few original scores in the soundtrack. She's a big part of this movie. She's from Barbados, just like her character. It's practically her life on screen. Putting their unlikely coupling aside, Home will undoubtedly amuse its young audience. Oh's automatically appealing because he's the bad egg. There's a cute, lovable Calico cat that acts like a dog, following Tip everywhere. The Boov are funny where Oh struggles to be, led by their Captain, Smek (Steve Martin). Home lacks originality, but proves to beat expectations."
201,Home,8,29 September 2015,Definitely worth a watch!!!,"An alien running for his life from his own people who have now inhabited the earth, befriends a girl and helps her find her mother . . . the main plot as you might have read already. nonetheless a very nice story as one gets started.there isn't anything that deep to get into this film, but as usual there is the crazy comedy and adventure which if done nicely gets our eyeballs glued all the time. this is what we mostly get from DREAM WORKS. Animations were as expected: one of the best (dream works). what impressed me most was the character designing, of both Tip and the Boovs. chubby fellows with funny traits such the skin- color-changing perks along with the hilarious speaking mistakes . . . Quite entertaining. and Tip was definitely something else. Loved her!!!What this film made me feel regarding the Boovs was that they were definitely different and quite likable, but to think that that the can be compared to Minions and the Penguins as well as the Smurfs is just a delusion. To replace especially Minions gonna take a lot more than just some fat and chubby aliens with broken English . . .Nevertheless this film was a thumbs up for me because it delivered just what i was hoping for and it did a pretty good job.All in all: Another good flick from dreamworks!!!"
202,Home,9,27 September 2015,Definitely worth watching,"Home was one of those movies which, upon watching the trailer, I knew I'd have to eventually watch. Dreamworks movies are all set to teach us some basic lessons in life and, for this particular movie, Love and Friendship were the chosen ones. Tip and Oh, who were first enemies, were quickly drawn to liking one another for each other's characteristics and similarities: they were both outcasts and they understood each other for that same reason. While Oh tries to explain Tip why the Boov's were actually friendly, Tip maintained her attitude against the Boov population and ways of thinking and taught Oh, along their ride, precious little lessons everyone should know about humans and their interaction and feelings. Eventually, one of the parties end up realizing not everything is as black and white as it seemed and new priorities are set. All in all, a good, worth watching movie, be it for children or adults. It may, though, not suit the tastes of most teenagers."
203,Home,9,25 September 2015,"Love this movie, please read!","My review may be not fair for all of you, but i learn a lot of things in this movie. Even, until now, i still watch this movieFor me, boov is the future human behavior (technology effect). Selfish, only care about themselves, do not friends, busy with smartphone, loss of humanity, etc. This Oh! is really teach me on how we should behave as human. I told my kids to be a human, not technology. Love your family, socialize, taking care of others, risk is element of success etcMany of us did not agree on the language used by boov, but some justify boov as alien, which of course differ from human. But i enjoy the language used, and somehow, it makes sense!"
204,Home,8,20 September 2015,The movie gets WAY better after the uninteresting first 20 minutes,"I watched this on the plane. I stopped after 20 minutes as I got bored of this movie. However, I got bored on the plane, so I watched the movie some more. It got a LOT better. I started to care for the characters a lot more, the plot became way more engaging, and the whole movie got much more enjoyable and heartwarming. The movie's humour also became funnier and more enjoyable.The first quarter is unengaging, but the second quarter is quite enjoyable. The third quarter is great, and the fourth quarter is absolutely incredible.The reason I can't give this a 10 is because the beginning is uninteresting, with the fun kicking in at 25-30 minutes.Pros:+ Nice story+ Enjoyable+ Really, really great second halfCons:Occasionally boring (at least this stops around halfway)First 20 minutes is somewhat uninterestingRating: 9"
205,Home,6,16 September 2015,adorable aliens for the little ones,The Boov is an alien race that is good at running away. They are being chased by the scary Gorg. Captain Smek (Steve Martin) has picked Earth to take over. All the human population is peacefully relocated to Happy Humanstown. Oh (Jim Parsons) tries to invite his new Boov neighbors to a party but nobody wants to go. He sends an invitation. His mistake is sending the invitation to ALL in the universe including Gorg. He becomes a fugitive Boov and encounters Gratuity 'Tip' Tucci (Rihanna) who was missed during the human round up.The aliens are cute and this is one of the most adorable alien takeover of the Earth. Their broken English is also adorable. The girl character is fine. The adventure is lackluster. It's not terribly exciting. It should be good for the little ones who can't take the excitement. Even the happy party ending is nice and easy which is geared to the little ones.
206,Home,5,30 August 2015,"Fun, for the kids (mainly)","Shrek and Toy Story, or rather the two 'holy grails' of children's films. This is largely because they can be enjoyed by both kids and adults alike. They are both packed with jokes and gags which can be appreciated on two levels  some of which the adults will roll their eyes at, others that will go completely over the little ones' heads and have them asking Mummy and Daddy why they're laughing.Sadly, 'Home' isn't one of these films. Yes, it's meant for children and if my ten year old daughter was writing this review she'd probably give it top marks. And that would be a fair grade  from a child, i.e. its primary audience. However, kids seldom write film reviews online. I do. And I had to sit through this.To be fair... I've been forced to watch worse children's movies in my time as a parent. This one is about a race of aliens who one day decide that Earth will be their new home. Naturally the existing earthlings who just so happen to inhabit the planet aren't taken into a consideration. All us pink flesh-bags are scooped up and dumped in Australia while the little purple spacemen merrily move into our apartment blocks and offices. All humans but one.A little girl (and her cat) called 'Tip' (believe it or not) is the only human left behind. She exists kind of like 'Newt' from 'Aliens,' forced to scavenged and steal when the aliens' backs are turned. That's until she meets 'Oh' (again, I didn't name him). He's an alien who is generally a misfit and at odds with his species. They form a friendship and yadder, yadder, yadder  adventure, bonding, if you've seen a kids' movie you know how it goes. And there's a moral at the end and stuff like that.This is all pretty run-of-the-mill stuff and I could live with that. If it wasn't for Oh himself. To me  and I stress, I am only an adult  I found him really annoying. It was almost like the film-makers wanted to give Jar-Jar Binks his own movie (*shudders* at the thought). Seriously, this alien is very irritating. He's always doing the wrong thing and I can see why his own species want to get rid of him. I was half tempted to jump into the TV screen and laser the little guy to death myself.But, as I kept having to remind me, it's a KIDS' movie. And I'm not the intended audience. So, if you have a little one who you want to keep entertained for an hour and a half, stick 'em in front of this DVD and they'll be happy. You can probably get away with popping out and sticking the kettle on. You won't miss much and, by this stage, you've probably seen enough kids' movies to work out that everyone lives happily ever after. But, unlike Toy Story and Shrek, I doubt even the kids will be that keen on repeat viewings of 'Home.' Find a friend or relative with the DVD and borrow it for a couple of weeks while the children are on holiday. Then, if they really love it, buy it. Don't waste your money straight away."
207,Home,4,7 September 2015,Good enough,"Oh and his fellow aliens take over the earth to hide from their enemy. But Oh ends up a fugitive and eventually helps a girl to pin down her mom, while escaping from the police himself. You must keep in mind that this is a children's movie. The story is based specifically on children standards, and so the aliens take over the planet in the most unharmed way that was possible. Even the bad guys weren't that scary. But the story is sweet and the movie is funny and interesting to watch. Sure the story isn't that original, but the dialogues make up for it and they are hilarious! The constant repetition of the urgency to find the mother is a little annoying though. So 4 out of 10 for Home."
208,Home,7,5 September 2015,"Colorful, fun, and overall harmless","I'll admit the main reason I checked this film out is because I'm a big fan of Jim Parsons' work on ""The Big Bang Theory"", so I figured he was a natural choice to voice a misfit alien (he was, BTW). The story, while a bit predictable, provides a nice backdrop for all kinds of sight gags and throwaway jokes you would expect from fish-out-of-water comedies, which this film is at its core. Steve Martin was also excellent as the leader of the Boov, who provides one of this film's main sources of conflict expertly. Rihanna's performance as Tip, however, was something I could take or leave; while I understand why they had her contribute to the soundtrack, her songs coming in about every 10-15 mins. or so just got intrusive after a while and tended to take me out of the story. It does all build to an ultimately satisfying, if predictable, conclusion; if you're after a fun little fish-out-of-water film that's OK for the whole family, give ""Home"" a look..."
209,Home,,29 July 2015,"This is not invasion, this is immigration","I live in US, I'm not a citizen. You can say this is a review from the point of a Boov. I heard the pop songs, I can't decipher a word of lyrics, the style is ""elevator music"", impersonal junk, there's no personal need to google-search, I distantly know a name of Rhianna, I recognize it's obtrusive (that's the word?) commercial nature in the general movie structure. Minus one. Don't have kids - don't care for post-merchandise. You say that OH is voiced by a guy from ""BigBang"". Saw that. It's stupid. No connection for me. There's the kid book it's based on, recommended by NYTimes, of all possible. Different ending, style and values. The Boov do NOT invade, they immigrate (in the movie). There is no political clash - military or political (as it were in the book). They displace and extrude the natives. They're refugees, not necessarily ET. Don't know the language, culture and customs. That's it. The Tip girl from the previous wave of emigres meets a Boov from the latest immigrant wave. It is a Donald Trump story..."
210,Home,7,4 July 2015,Home is where ...,"Where what is? Wouldn't hurt to have friends at the place you call home. Something our two leads do have some trouble to find. For different reasons obviously. And while the raid on earth might seem brutal and an odd place to look for humor, it's the beginning that leads to a crazy friendship.Of course many story related things are more than predictable and it is mostly aimed at the younger audience. But while we don't have the same level of having jokes for the ""older"" viewing public (as we get from Pixar to name the currently best animation studio), there's still a lot of fun to be had. Like the fact, that J-Lo (voice) is the mother of Rihanna (voice). Now that's a deadly mother-daughter duet (as in awesome), if there ever was one ..."
211,Home,6,14 June 2015,Incredible use of music,"Whilst I don't want to talk about the characters and story itself, this is the first movie that made me feel like I had missed something as I finished watching it. It bothered me throughout the night and I simply had to re-watch it and pay attention to what I missed.The music. Albeit it's not the best music, that is countered by its usage throughout the movie. It was so masterfully done that if I believed in review ratings, this aspect of the movie would be out of the chart. I simply had to pay attention to it the second time and why it was so impacting and so easy to miss at first. They used it in subtle and more deliberate moments. Of course, the more deliberate moments are indeed marking, even presenting music with lyrics during dialog and yet it was incredibly timed to the point it complemented the dialog.There are other reasons to watch this movie, allegories and some very memorable scenes. But if you're going to watch it; Pay attention to this. You don't want to miss it."
212,Home,,9 June 2015,A fairly entertaining animation for young children,"This film tells the story of an extraterrestrial being who is an outcast in his race. Her accidentally sends out an invitation to his housewarming party to the entire universe, attracting the enemy species to come to destroy the Earth.""Home"" is probably aimed at very young kids. The character designs are simple but cute. It took me a while to realise that the lead character is voiced by Rihanna, and the character looks like her too. I'm a little annoyed by the constant Rihanna songs playing in the film, it makes it a very extended advertisement of Rihanna!The story itself is just fairly OK, the jokes are aimed at very young children and hence look quite unintelligent for adults. The theme of friendship and family is highlighted, but it doesn't quite grab or move me like other recent animations."
213,Home,,5 June 2015,Home,"Wow, nice Movie! Maybe to much Rihanna!Most lovely character is pig. Fantastic idea to build a story about family, and how value family is. Most of us grown ups, maybe forgot already who value our childhood was, and how strong our mind was to kick something forward. Breath taking pictures, and heartbreaking moments. Funny car and elevator, beautiful picture of the world, could be real. Quite colorful world, with his own rules. Simple construct talking, very logical solutions. Personally, I adore the adorable starfish and his secret. Watch the movie at cinema or at home.. You will definitely love it."
214,Home,9,25 May 2015,By Far The Best Animated Movie of Year 2015,"Dream Works Animation over the years have produced excellent animated movies be it Shrek or How to train your Dragon or Kung Fu Panda and the list goes on....Home is another diamond in their crown. Its Crown Jewel if i am not to say much. What impresses viewers most is the novel ideas you get with every new movie.Movie starts with a creature BOOV named ""Oh"" (you ll love him from the time you get to set eye on him) who always lands himself in trouble due to his friendly and unknowingly hilarious nature. He is hated by all his fellows and is always trying to find friends when no one bothers to friend him. They are overruled by ""Captain Smeck"" who is specialized to Run away from trouble. Movie follows by Oh becoming a wanted criminal and sets on a journey with his yet to be friend Tip(voiced by Rihanna). Firstly to talk about voices from Jim Parsons to Steve Martin everyone is amazing. Comic timing is just about perfect. Background music is superb. Everybody comes out humming to the tunes. Storyline is awesome. Visuals are believable and ecstatic. Well to sum it up, its a visual saga with everything to offer. Its amazing. I wonder for such movies ticket prices should be higher than usual(just a crazy thought)coz people who created it have done it with love for the art. Go see it, and it ll not make you bore at least thrice...Fun to watch...Loved it and ll love it always.."
215,Home,10,25 May 2015,best movie ever :),"i really enjoyed this movie.. some scenes were so funny.. me and my friends watched it though we all are 23 but had so much fun watching it.. love the soundtrack especially. i know some people are saying its not that good but form my prospective i enjoyed it a lot. the smile of tip is sooooo cute.. day by day these Disney animations are getting even more amazing. oh character is so cute and funny the way he speaks English makes you realize that language is not the main reason to get along with someone. and even there is less probability of getting success you should never give up. the characters has out done them self this time.. i have read some comments saying that the 10 star rating are all fake, i have something to say, if you don't like it doesn't mean that others will hate it as well. i was so glad to see so many 10 star rating. this movie deserves it. the funny thing about the characters are that they resembles a lot to their real life body structure, means J Lo and Rihanna had a little curved body in the movie. the foolishness that OH makes is so cute.. amazing movie <3 loved it"
216,Home,10,23 May 2015,Best animation this year,"I am a big fan of animations movies ... and this one is among the best one I've seen. The script, the characters, the music ... all excellent ! Jim Parsons is the best choice ever for the voice of Oh, sadly could not say the same thing for Rihanna, but well .. I could live with it.I laughed, I cried ..this movie has everything, and probably going to see it again.I also appreciated the story and the fact that you could not tell by the trailer what the film it's all about.I think I am gonna rank it right after Brave, Big Hero 6 and Astro Boy (where I cried my eyes out).Definitely a must watch."
217,Home,8,25 April 2015,Lighthearted and great fun,"After earth is taken over by the Boov, and all humans relocated, the alien Oh (Jim Parsons) finds himself on the run from his fellow aliens for accidentally alerting the Boov's enemy to their whereabouts. He meets up with Tip (Rihanna), and in exchange for helping him flee he promises her to help find her mother.Jim Parsons, for me, made this movie. He was absolutely delightful as the little alien Oh, and he created one of the most endearing characters I've seen in an animation. Rihanna did fine job with Tip, and although I may be biased (coz I am, I suppose, a Rihanna fan), I felt she was nicely cast and she brought a sassy energy to the role, and together, they had had a great chemistry.Acting aside, I did feel it ran a bit long; or rather: some parts seemed to drag on. And while it had, at times, a rather quirky humour I felt it was much more suited to a younger audience  and it probably was. And so maybe it is for that reason alone I felt it sometimes lacking.Nonetheless, it had a good story with good characters and as I mentioned, great performances. I also felt that the animation and design was quite amazing; I loved how the Boov changed colour as their emotions changed, and their overall appearance was a lot of fun to watch. On the whole, it was a heartwarming little movie and would definitely make for a very enjoyable way to spend an afternoon."
218,Home,8,19 April 2015,Alien emotion through color,"I expected this to use a lot of humor for kids and not be that interesting for the grownups taking their kids to the movies, but it was much more then I expected and had great fun for the entire family. This follows in the long line of animation films that has just as much to offer the children and the childish adults that tag along to see it :) My kids had been talking about this strange purple character they had seen commercials for and I did not get what they meant at all, but after seeing it, there is a lot of fun moments, and you can really see the difficulties in experiencing a new world from an alien perspective.This is just a film you have to see, if for nothing else, then the voices, they are really great and Parson really hits the spot on this one as the different yet curious non- stop talking alien :) But for a lot of other aspects this is great and can be seen by everyone, the characters are great and the way they show everyone around them their emotions is quite genius and works well for the watching kids in knowing what is going on."
