0,Flushed Away,,24 October 2006,"Hugely funny, technically brilliant","I saw Flushed Away at a press screening in Berlin where it was shown in English to an overwhelmingly German audience. Leaving aside the clich√©s (Germans DO have a sense of humour - it's just different, okay?!), coming as yet another in a long line of CGI films and with (let's be honest here) a less than gripping concept, Flushed Away had only a certain amount of goodwill from this professional crowd. So when an audience like this, yours truly included, laughs aloud and often then there's something special up on the screen!The humour is overwhelmingly English and there is none of the morality messaging that makes family films from certain other studios such a cringe-inducing experience. The characters are very well drawn (literally as well as figuratively) and the voice casting is universally excellent. The standard of animation is fantastic but you never once get the sense that anyone is showing off what they can do. This is a story- and character-driven film, with the technology there to serve. Anyone writing it off because it is not claymation is doing themselves a great disservice.Lovers of Wallace & Gromit and Aardman's work in general will have a ball spotting the oh so many references. The level of detail is amazing and it's going to take many viewings and many hours with the DVD on pause to spot them all. There are the bunnies from Curse of the Wererabbit, for example. I spotted the Lion King on the little girl's windowsill, and so on. And on.When a film credits several writers, plus comedy consultants, it's usually a sign that the script has gone horribly and tragically wrong. Maybe it did, to begin with, and the start is just a tad slow, but it soon picks up speed and the jokes, verbal and visual, just keep coming.Like the best family films, Flushed Away appeals to audiences of all ages, but the very young might find it a bit long. Not that it lags at any time, merely that the wee tots might get fidgety, you understand.The cast do a great job and I'm not going to single out anyone for special mention. The performances are spot on and everyone is obviously having a tongue in cheek good time. For professional reasons, I get to watch some 300 or more films a year. Flushed Away belongs to the very, very few that I wanted to see again right after it had finished. And before you ask, no, I am not being paid, induced or threatened at gunpoint to write this. I had a cracking good time, as did my girlfriend (Julia, German, with sense of humour) and you will too."
1,Flushed Away,8,4 November 2006,Another smash from Aardman!,"Like a lot of film reviewers, I had a lot of reservations about this film when I first saw the trailer. At first I thought it was going to be just another hastily made CGI cartoon about edgy cartoon animals, filled with top 40 or dance songs and full of topical jokes. The fact that as I waited for the movie to start, half the trailers were for more CGI cartoons about edgy cartoon animals and the other half was for films about trash talking fairy tale characters.Thankfully this movie was a blessed reprieve from all of that. In Flushed Away, Aardman studios has made yet another family classic that will still be as entertaining ten years from now as it is today. Granted, it's loaded with a lot of pop songs and oldies, but most of them are sung by a chorus of slugs (which makes for one of the best running gags I've seen in a while).The story actually felt pretty fresh for a family movie, or any movie for that matter. While it's by no means unpredictable, it doesn't feel too much like it's treading over the same ground most family films seem to go over these days. The jokes were surprisingly clever too. While there's the usual slapstick humor, there's also plenty of highbrow jokes thrown in the mix. (How often do you find references to Kafka in an animated feature, after all?) What I liked best about this movie was that Aardman stayed true to its roots of making stop-motion films. My initial worry was that they had sold out and were going to just make CGI films from here on out like everybody else, but when you watch this film, you'll see that they do as much as possible to maintain the look of their other animated films like Chiken Run and Wallace & Gromit. Overall this is a great selection to take your family to see, and worth seeing even if you're a grown up too."
2,Flushed Away,9,3 November 2006,Absolutely outstanding,"Flushed Away carries a weight of intellect with it not often found these days in American cinema and television. It's sharp-witted yet poignant and fresh at the same time.I went in with the expectations of it being another animated film in an ocean of animated films, but I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly entertained.The message of the film is an ever-fading idea that isolation from each other is how we will become destroyed. The idea that one must go far, far beyond their comfort zone and any form of complacency to find what truly matters in life. The films treatment of this ideology, again, is brilliant in my opinion.It has excellent writing, the animation is absolutely top notch, and the voice talent live up to their high dollar reputations. Everyone is outstanding in this film and it is a must see during the holidays.Go see Flushed Away!!! Go now!!"
3,Flushed Away,8,5 November 2006,Just  call me an English Fool,"The fact that I could be entertained by another one of these animated talking animal movies is a miracle. Is this number 1000 over the past 2 years? I just love English sarcasm, wit, dryness that strikes a chord in these old bones. The great news, nobody was in drag.During the movie, there are inside English jokes that Americans may not understand such as ""England loses on penalty kicks"" which is a modern football tradition in the UK and the English love of knick knacks. The singing slugs don't do it for me but the kids liked them.I highly recommend this movie even if you are sick of computer animated talking animals."
4,Flushed Away,9,2 November 2006,A Nutshell Review: Flushed Away,"Hugh Jackman is everywhere these days, from reprising his iconic Wolverine role in summer blockbuster X3, to starring twice alongside Scarlett Johansson in Woody Allen's Scoop and Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, and now, just lending his voice to a lead character in the animated film Flushed Away, co-starring his summer blockbuster star Sir Ian McKellen. Soon to come will be Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. Whew! There seems to be no stopping this Hollywood flavour of the month!Despite this animated movie being yet another one of many based on talking animals, Flushed Away doesn't try too hard to be funny by steamrolling pop culture into the story. It just is funny with its deft touches, be it dialogue, slapstick, or various sight gags. Although it's set primarily in the sewers, it's beautiful chaos, with loads of little details all over that you'll probably need to watch it twice over to appreciate all the effort put in to create the computerized graphical sets.At first glance, you might think you're watching a Wallace and Gromit animated show. Yes, this is produced by the same studio, Aardman Animations, in association with Dreamworks, and it is no wonder that the animation, although computer generated, maintained a very clay like look and feel, as well as character designs bearing similar resemblance in style to W&G.The story is simple enough, yet adequately satisfying by the time the end credits roll. As the trailer suggested, Aristocratic rat pet Roddy from Kensington (Hugh Jackman) thought he just had the whole classy apartment to himself, when an unexpected guest Sid (Shane Richie) from the sewers gatecrashes into his abode, and ejects him through the ""jacuzzi"". All these in less than 10 minutes. So begins a mad journey in an unknown sewer world which replicated the modern London City above it with junk, where he has to figure out friend from foe, and find his way back to where he belongs.The themes of family and friends do not come on too strongly, instead the story preferred to let the character interactions bring forth the messages. Supporting or interfering in his quest are characters like Rita (Kate Winslet), The Toad (Ian McKellen), French Le Frog (Jean Reno), and rat minions Whitey (Bill Nighy) and Spike (Andy Serkis). It's quite commendable that in its less than 90 minutes runtime, it allowed for quite a bit of set action pieces to develop, along with almost laugh-a-minute lines of dialogue, a good mix of songs (Hugh sings!) and ooh, a diabolical plot.But what perhaps is the show stealer, are the sewer slugs. Ever popping up and performing at the right time, I'm sure they are crowd favourites despite their less than pleasant looking exterior. I wonder if they do sell the soft toy version, as it should be quite hilarious.If too many animated flicks left this year has left you jaded with the genre, Flushed Away just flushes away the competition. Worth checking out on the big screen!"
5,Flushed Away,8,2 November 2006,Flushed Away is far from crap,"Flushed Away is the perfect marriage between the American Dreamworks and their crass sense of humor and the British Aardman and their dry sense of humor. Beside the obvious jokes about the sewer there's much to enjoy for the more sophisticated viewer. Like a cockroach reading FranzKafka's The Metamorphosis. The voice-cast is spot on: Ian McKellen as the evil genius The Toad is pure delight, Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman are clearly having a blast giving their voices to rats Rita and Roddy. But the cream of the crop are the singing and screaming snails. When they sing at the top of their lungs Proud Mary you laugh so hard you have to check your underpants to see if you haven't had a little accident."
6,Flushed Away,8,24 October 2006,A sure knock out!,"Being the creators and producers of both Chicken Run and the Wallace & Gromit series, people should expect a lot from the talents of the Aardman company. Luckily, again they succeed in making a great movie with their first computer animated flick Flushed Away. The story is about a spoiled rat named Roddy (Hugh Jackman). He leads a save life as the pet of an upper class English girl. When the family is away on holiday Roddy gets flushed in the toilet and suddenly finds himself in the sewer. There he discovers a giant city filled with rats and a cruel frog boss called Toad. In an attempt to get back home Roddy enlists the help from the female shipper Rita. But she gets him into more trouble when she accidentally steals an import item from Toad. It doesn't take long before both Roddy and Rita are wanted by the whole frog mob¬Ö When movies like Cars or Over the Hedge get more and more photo realistic, Flushed Away puts an emphasis on fun and visual comedy. From the first screen second you know that you're looking at a different kind of movie. This is England, not America. Here they play soccer and not football. The movie starts at a fast pace and never lets go. The opening scene, in which Roddy plays with the toys in the house, is so funny that you get scared that the makers will not run out of bright ideas too soon. But one shouldn't worry. Most of the visual ideas are absolutely brilliant. Just take a look at rat city, which is made of microwaves, phone boots and washing machines. You should watch the movie at least twice to see it all. Of course there are a lot of reverences to other movies (James Bond, Finding Nemo and even Terminator 2) but those moments don't play a mayor part in the movie. The story is fresh and funny and leads to a nice finale involving an important soccer match.What makes Flushed Away succeed for sure are all the great characters. Toad (Ian McKellen) is a great and funny villain, the always likable Kate Winslet is a strong heroin, Bill Nighy has great moments as Toad's bodyguard Whitey and Jean Reno plays a very laughable French hit-man. But Flushed Away really is carried by Hugh Jackman, who's great performance makes you both laugh and cry. He is both the spoiled nerd as well as the over polite butler. He gets heroic if he must and even carries a great tune singing Tom Jones songs. Actually there are a lot of songs in this movie. Usually that's a thing that I don't like in CGI movies, but in Flushed Away it just works out fine. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that most of the singing was done by maggots¬Ö Because of all the scenes with water Flushed Away couldn't have been done with clay animation alone. So don't be fooled by the combination Aardman and computers. Flushed Away is a sure knock out!"
7,Flushed Away,8,31 October 2006,Super cute!,"This film didn't sound appealing to me when I first heard about it; a rat society living in the underground waterways of England wasn't my idea of an interesting movie. But, I was invited to see a screening of it recently, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised after seeing it! This film is different, exciting, adventurous, and fun to watch! I liked Rita (Kate Winslet) the best, but that's if I had to choose one character. Roddy (Hugh Jackman) was the star though. The little slugs singing on the side are cute in their own way too. The underlying message of how important family and friends are is well done. It's great for the whole family!"
8,Flushed Away,7,3 November 2006,"Fun movie, just leave the Ritalin at home.","I have to admit that I went into this movie with the mixed expectations. I'm haven't been especially impressed with Dreamworks animations, minus ""Over the Hedge"" which I think is their first film that stands on its own two feet without relying on the popularity of previous animations or pop-culture references.But enough on that, Flush Away was an enjoyable romp of animation. My only real complaint, is the pacing. The entire thing feels a roller coaster that you ride upside down -- with rotating seats. (Perhaps a contraption Aardman would come up with). The gags are amusing and some are very funny, but I need some breathing/laughing time between them.Yet if your brain can handle the onslaught of information, you will be able to appreciate the extraordinary amount of creativity in terms of visuals and attention to detail. There's also plenty of adult innuendo and witty jabs at Europeans and Americans alike. Katzenburg's philosophy of making movies ""for adults, and the adult in every child."" is very evident here. The kids were rolling in the theater with all the slapstick, and the savvy adults had their own laugh track.In this sense, the film is a success minus the ridiculous pacing. It's worth a look, just leave the Ritalin at home."
9,Flushed Away,7,5 November 2006,My favorite Aardman feature so far,"Wallace and Gromit are critics darlings. Chicken Run had great reviews as well. I liked all those animated films somewhat, but I never understood their appeal to the critics. To me they were just so-so. This film has not done as well with the critics. It retains somewhat the look of the aforementioned claymation that Aardman is so famous for, but as most people reading this are probably well aware, it is strictly computer animated fare. I truly enjoyed it more than the other films by the talented animators at Aardman. Not a lot more. I much preferred the Shrek films and The Incredibles for recent animated greats. But you could do a lot worse than spending 90 minutes with your kids in a theater watching Flushed Away. ( The film across the hall at my multiplex comes to mind as I really did not want to go watch Tim Allen in a Santa suit for a third time.) The slugs (or perhaps they were leeches) were my favorite characters in the film. I found myself laughing a lot at their antics, sound effects and musical talent. I had fun. Nothing great but a good deal of fun."
10,Flushed Away,9,16 November 2006,"Fun, funny and fast paced family fare","FLUSHED AWAY (2006) *** (VOICES OF: Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, Bill Nighy, Andy Serkis, Shane Richie, Kathy Burke, David Suchet, Miriam Margolyes) Fun and funny animated comedy about a pampered pet rat named Roddy (Jackman having a ball) who is literally flushed down the family toilet and discovers a subterranean world populated by all forms of vermin including the tomboy-ish Rita (Winslet also excelling at pleasing herself), a scavenger who is attempting to help her extended nuclear family's debt to the villainous underworld kingpin , The Toad (McKellen, relishingly good) and his henchmen Whitey and Spike (Nighy and Serkis, respectively). From the geniuses at Aardman Animation and DreamWorks, the lively and warm-hearted family fare will appeal to all ages but occasionally drags to become an instant classic. However the shrieking Greek chorus of slimy slugs are a riot. (Dirs: David Bowers and Sam Fell)"
11,Flushed Away,10,14 January 2007,"Brilliant, funny and worth seeing again","I went to see this twice I enjoyed it so much. It is ""British"" humour and I can imagine it not being entirely to some American tastes. This however doesn't stop it being excellent.Tremendous attention to detail, a clever story and scripting which can be understood by both adults and children. Also one of the funniest running gag ideas ever - The singing slugs, they still make me smile when I think about them.Aardman have a knack for this sort of thing and this collaboration is an improvement on their already impressive portfolio.If you see this film and don't laugh at any of it, then you have no sense of humour"
12,Flushed Away,10,20 December 2006,Excellent animated movie!!!,"I don't watch very often animated movies, but I heard that this was a funny and adventurous one, and I must say that this affirmation prove correct because I enjoyed it a lot... The main character is Roddy ,a rat who lives in a cage in the house of a family as a pet...He has everything he wants except friends and family...So one day he gets flushed away and arrives in a rat town in the sewers where he meets Rita, a female rat...With her help he manages to save the town from the plan of The Toad who hates rats and wants to destroy them...Here he also discovers the important things and understands that life is more than stuff... I gave it a 10 because I didn't find it boring and because I view it as very innovative."
13,Flushed Away,9,17 December 2006,"Brilliant animated film, but not quite perfect.","Flushed Away is the first CGI-animated film from Aardman. Though Aardman Animations don't make a huge load of movies, at least what they do make is bloody good, and this lived up to the high reputations it set itself.This film was so much more than just rats getting flushed down toilets - it was one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen. Beating off competition from Ice Age 2 and Over the Hedge, this is definitely the funniest animated film this year - singing slugs, thick villain's minions and frogs with French accents never get old. Flushed Away was full of vivid characters - and that is what Aardman are best at - creating characters that the audience will love. Though there's rarely any grit between Rita and Roddy, that doesn't matter - this is a kid's film. But adults will love it as well - Aardman Animations have created another universally appealing film.With an absolutely astronomical budget ($143,000,000), this film will need to take the box office by storm to become a true success. But I'm sure it will - though animated films with talking animals are ten a penny nowadays, this is more than just more talking-animal fare - it has emotion, wit and character, and that is why Flushed Away is great. Even if it bombs, at least it can be safe in the knowledge that everybody who has seen it has had a great time. 9/10"
14,Flushed Away,7,2 September 2015,An animated adventure that dances to its own beat,"FLUSHED AWAY (2006) is an adventure tale about a pet rat from a posh London neighborhood who is flushed out of his home and into the sewers, where he discovers a thriving rat city.Hugh Jackman voices Roddy, the rat from ""up top"" who doesn't realize how lonely he is until he gets a taste of life in the outside world. Kate Winslet voices Rita the sewer rat, a street-smart woman-of-action who captains a ship and hunts for treasure to support her poor family. Roddy hopes Rita can help him get home, but his bumbling gets her into trouble with the sinister Toad (voiced deliciously by Sir Ian McKellen).FLUSHED AWAY is a film from the British-based Aardman Studios (of Wallace & Gromit fame). Released through Dreamworks Animation, it is a rare foray for Aardman into the realm of feature-length computer animation, which is stylized to approximate the studio's signature stop-motion aesthetic (particularly with the staccato mouth movements).The animation in the opening scene at Roddy's house seems well below the industry standard, surprisingly poor for a major studio release in 2006, but the film looks better once the action moves to the sewers.Any shortcomings in the animation are easily overlooked because the film is so creative and so much fun. The movie is packed with visual gags and a wonderful sense of comedy. It's a rather unique story, full of delightful quirks. The Toad is a riot and his French cousin Le Frog (Jean Reno) and his team of scuba suit-wearing henchfrogs are hilarious. (The mime gag is comedic genius.) The singing slugs provide well-timed comic relief, and are much funnier (in an oddball way) than the popular comic relief minions of DESPICABLE ME (2010).Very much a British film, the action is set in London around the hoopla of the soccer World Cup. The Toad has a collection of Royal Family memorabilia and even has a tragic personal history with Prince Charles. The filmmakers also have fun with cultural stereotypes, spoofing American tourists as well as Frenchmen, Italians, etc. (as seen through British eyes).And for a movie about toilets and sewers, the script tries to go easy on the really gross stuff. The full implications of the premise are glossed over to make for a more stomachable film, though there are a couple gross-out gags that the filmmakers couldn't pass up.With so many wonderful characters (in addition to those mentioned, Andy Serkis and an almost unrecognizable Bill Nighy voice the Toad's odd couple rat henchmen to hilarious effect), some truly great character animation (the Toad and the bouncy frogs in particular), such a brilliant sense of humor, and an adventure story that is both exciting and full of heart, FLUSHED AWAY is an entertaining flick. Its creativity, especially in the creation of the rat city (built out of miniature odds and ends from the human world above) and the sewer civilization of anthropomorphic critters, is impressive. It's nice to see a film that's not derivative, and one that's so much fun.6.5/10"
15,Flushed Away,6,24 November 2006,A dull central character hurts a film filled with great asides and one liners,"Beautiful pieces never hang together in this tale of a family pet who ends up in the sewer when a rat from the street turns the tables on him and flushes him down the toilet. This is the first Aardman piece that I really don't care for. Certainly I will watch it again to see if I'm wrong, but for the most part this film didn't work for me. Its not that the film is bad, as such, its not, its just that Hugh Jackman's lead is rather a dull fellow. From the moment his owners left him home alone and he began to occupy himself in the big house all alone I was lost. There was no reason for me to care about him or his world. That changes to some degree once he gets into the sewer which holds a vast number of visual an aural wonders to behold. From a mini version of London to slugs that sing to spoofs and one liners this film is all about the throwaways (many of which are real gems). As a group of loosely connect bits its more than fine, unfortunately there is nothing to hold the bits together and as a result the film falls apart. Worth a look for Aardman fans and for those are undemanding in their cartoons."
16,Flushed Away,,4 September 2007,Smile Away,"I've always enjoyed those Aardman animations. The characters look very similar to those seen in Aardman's 'Curious Creatures'. However, here instead of using the 3d models (claymation), computer graphics have been applied. Even though the story isn't something people take away home, 'Flushed Away' has its own charm and the British humour stands out thanks to the smart and witty character(ization)s and smart dialogue and becomes a cleverly significant part of the screenplay. The screenplay is extremely fast paced such that if you miss a minute, you'll be lost. The character formation is remarkable. Both worlds are created with great attention to detail. I particularly liked the wonderful way the underground world was created. The voice actors form a one-of-a-kind fantastic ensemble and do nothing short of a great job. This is one film that i think will get better with repeated viewing. At least I can bet that you'll smile away for the most part. A great movie for kids. Heck, why only kids?"
17,Flushed Away,10,28 February 2007,10 stars for this Great Entertainment,"This movie is so fun. It has a lot of small, but effective jokes. Overall story is familiar, but the way in which is presented is so amusing. There are so many fun details in, well, everything. From characters to environment, from conversation to action, this movie is full of hilarious moments. Voice acting is excellent, everyone hit the right mood. Characters are biggest enjoyment and there is a whole bunch of them who are very memorable. Songs and their performances, but especially their singers will put a smile on my face whenever I think of them.To conclude, this movie is whole lot of fun, even if the rats are main characters."
18,Flushed Away,10,13 November 2006,Actors Having Fun!,"Saw this on the recommendation of a friend, and it is clear that everyone involved with this picture had a tremendous amount of fun. I enjoyed the English humor, the lingo, the characters, and the settings. Ian McKellan as the Toad seemed to be having the time of his life (performing Shakespeare's King Lear next year will be a dramatic step down for him). McKellan's Toad is no downstream villain - his nastiness is HUGE! But there is a tragic back story which explains his bitter evil. You must see it to believe it. The overall theme of this picture is family and the importance of being with people you love - pampered loneliness vs. sewer solidarity (guess which ""wins"" in the end?) All in all, one of the least predictable and most enjoyable animated pictures I have seen. There will be a lot of jokes (the bad guys are French frogs) that grown-ups and the English will get, but kids won't. But it is still a very enjoyable time at the movies. I highly recommend it."
19,Flushed Away,10,9 November 2006,Flushed away all my expectations,"This movie was absolutely brilliant! The animation was among the very best I have ever seen (surpassing even that of Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, and others). It was hilariously funny, colorful, bright, witty, and entertaining! This movie far exceeded all my expectations, it is a must-see!!!The voices are spot-on perfect for the characters, the little ""puns"" here and there are just brilliant, and the story is unique. Great for all ages. I am a 36-year-old male, and I enjoyed this movie very much. There were several laugh-out-loud scenes and brilliant gags and jokes that kept me laughing after the movie was over."
20,Flushed Away,10,3 November 2006,Entertaining Family Movie,"I saw this today with my two sons who are 8 & 11. I am quite a big fan of many of the actors who voiced characters in this film. I am also a fan of it's unique format, whether it was stop motion or animated to appear that way, it looked great and very unique. I see MANY family movies and this one ranked very high on my list. Many of the jokes in the film, particularly the ones in the songs had me and my kids doubled over in laughter. Attendance was light as we attended a matin√©e, but you could hear others in the theatre howling with laughter also. There are almost too many animated films coming out these days, but this one was really original and enjoyable. Money well spent."
21,Flushed Away,2,5 January 2008,A real stinker that belongs in the sewers.,"Flushed Away sees Wallace and Gromit creators Aardman Animation (in cohorts with Dreamworks) making the transition from plasticene stop-motion to CGI in order to tell the tale of Roddy, a pampered pet rat who struggles to cope with sewer life after being flushed down a toilet.Unfortunately, although the plasticene quirkiness of Nick Park's style is digitally emulated to some degree of success, the film is ultimately let down by a weak plot, charmless characters, a rushed approach to the storytelling, and a distinct lack of decent laughs. Even the singing slugs, the best things in the film, aren't entirely original, being highly reminiscent of the three musical mice from Babe.The comedy mainly consists of toilet humour and visual gags, with references to many other films thrown in for good measure, but everything is so scatter-shot that much of these jokes will be missed on the first (and probably only, if the viewer has any sense) viewing.Considering Flushed Away has come from the combined talents that gave us the brilliant Curse Of The Wererabbit and the mighty Shrek, one can only come away feeling very disappointed indeed."
22,Flushed Away,8,24 December 2006,Wonderful,"Flushed Away is once again an animated film about talking animals. But the sense of humor that surrounds this film is completely different from the humor we have seen in other talking animal flicks this year. The main reason being is because it is British, and we all know that British comedy is far more witty, intelligent and funnier than American humor.Flushed Away centers around a rat named Roddy (voice by Hugh Jackman) who is a pet to a very wealthy family in Kensington. When the family goes on holiday, Roddy has the house to himself and is free to do whatever he wants. But soon all hell breaks loose as a sewer rat named Sid appears out of the kitchen sink and takes over Roddy's crib. Roddy schemes to flush Sid down the toilet, but Sid is not as stupid as he looks. Sid takes the opportunity to flush Roddy down the toilet, leaving him stranded in Ratropolis, an underground sewer city.Roddy soon gets caught up in the life of Rita the rat (voice by Kate Winslet) and an amusing love/hate relationship ensues.Flushed Away is made by Aardman who brought us Wallace and Gromit, and DreamWorks who brought us the Shrek films, it's no wonder the film is so hilarious. It isn't sugar coated for children the way Disney and Pixar films are.Look out for the singing slugs. They provide the film with laugh out loud comedy that will be appreciated by all."
23,Flushed Away,8,3 December 2006,Digital Claymation leapfrogs to Success!,"The show was Hugh Jackman's all the way with nods throughout the film to his works - such as having a villain as a Toad, like Magneto's henchman of the first X-Men movie and who is voicing the Toad? None other than the menacing Mogul of Magnetism Sir Ian McKellen!Another nod to Hugh was using the original Wolverine costume in the doll-house as a toss-up between that and the Elvis Presley karate-styled jumpsuit (he also got like Logan when ""winning"" a volleyball match with the figurines), also the tadpoles reminded me of the baby vampires in ""Van Helsing.""However, the rest of the movie was way different in that Hugh's character Roddy St James was very nerdish and effete who gets booted from his literally gilded-cage, this is very unlike what Oz' favourite son is accustomed to playing in most live-action scenarios (possible exception being Kate & Leopold, yet even there he chased away a mugger).Kate Winslet is more of the heroine in this flick as the rough and tumble Rita from the sewer-rats' version of the East End of London, but my annoying favourites were the choral slugs who cheered or jeered Hugh/Roddy every step of the way!This was a pseudo-claymation version of the old adage that ""You can't go home again,"" but if you want the total tale then you'll have to flush it out yourself!http://tinyurl.com/3464k/"
24,Flushed Away,10,19 November 2006,It helps if you're British but still a great laugh,"Oen of the things I noticed was I laughed in a lot of places where the rest of the audience didn't. Plenty of the jokes were lost on my US friends, eg, they did not know what a ""Jammy Dodger"" was (but I left the cinema with a Jammy Dodger fixation... gibber gibber) nor such throw away lines as Toad's ""Shut that door!"" (the catch phrase of the camp UK entertainer Larry Grayson). There were also plenty of scenes where the foreground action was supplemented by silly things going on in the background which seemed to mainly get overlooked.Having said that it was still well received, with plenty of jaw aching bely laughs throughout the whole film. You wondered at first if the story would run out of steam & fall flat, like Austin Powers: Goldmember, but the hectic pace kept going strong with both action & comedy at full throttle the whole way.When you have tripe like ""Happy Feet"" which follow the same tired old clich√©s over & over again, cloyingly sweet with fake sentiment, this film is a refreshing change.Finally, again for the UK fans, note that Dick Clement & Ian LeFrenais helped with the script have been one of the main stays of comedy writing in the UK for over 4 decades (The Likely Lads/Whatever Happened to The Likely Lads, Porridge/Going Straight, Not Only...But Also, The Dick Emery Show, The Tracy Ullman Show etc etc)Also note that owners of the last Ardmaaan DVD (The Curse of the Wererabbit) got a glimpse of Flushed Away, where the characters of Roddy & Rita were clearly identified as rats. Later here in the US this was fudged in some publicity so that Roddy was called a mouse & Rita was not defined. Now the publicity seems to avoid calling them anything, although the script still calls them rats."
25,Flushed Away,8,4 November 2006,Hysterical,"I thought that this movie was so funny. There is so much laugh-out-loud humor as well as a subtler humor running through it.Quick synopsis: Roddy, a pet rat, is left home alone while his family goes on vacation. Sid, a sewer rat, gets caught in an updraft and arrives in Roddy's house. He quickly takes over and ends up flushing Roddy down the toilet where he discovers a complete rat city in the sewers. As he is searching for a way home, he meets Rita, a rat who runs a river boat, and gets caught in her run from The Toad.If you like Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run, you will love it.It is wacky and silly, but great. The slugs are roll in the aisle funny and the French frogs are also very funny. Be sure to watch for a cameo by Wolverine's costume and another from ""Nemo"".The voice artists are great at capturing their characters and the animation is great. It is a blend of claymation and computers and they do it very well.Although it has a few elements of gross humor, the rest is kid-friendly and clean. There is also a whole level of humor running through the movie that the parents will enjoy even if the kids don't get it.Although it is not a must-see in the theater, it is definitely worth seeing."
26,Flushed Away,8,30 October 2006,Best Computer Aninmated film that Pixar Didn't make!,"So far I have been a little under whelmed with almost all of DreamWorks computer Animated films and I probably wouldn't have bothered with this one Except that I happened to be invited to a press screening. Let me tell you this is a really fun movie. Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackmen have such great chemistry. My husband and a friend of ours all went and we cracked up quite a bit. It reminded me of an animated ""Romance in the Stone."" And it looked just beautiful. I often forgot that it wasn't a claymation (sp?). I don't want to give anything away but if your looking for a cute, funny movie that wont bore your pants off and that you can take the kids too, this is it."
27,Flushed Away,5,24 March 2007,Hollywood action mixed with Aardman humor doesn't go down smooth,"This animated film about a rich but lonely rat named Roddy (Hugh Jackman) who gets flushed down the toilet by a sewer rat and ends up finding love and saving the rat world while trying to make his way back home had odd British and American flavors not completely weaved together. A collaboration of Aardman, who does the witty and very British Wallace and Gromit films and Dreamworks, which is about as Hollywood as they come came across as slightly uneven. Even Kate Winslet at Rita the rat or Jean Reno as Le Frog couldn't make this a superior Shrek-like film. The humor was either in-your-face potty (or slug, there's a whole singing slug thing going on) humor, they are in the sewer after all, or way over the head of the kids who would be attracted to this (the French jokes). An American Animated Action film with British wit, it tried and had a few stand out bits, but wasn't memorable in the end.This movie is like trifle, made with jello cake. You've seen those lemon sponge cakes with the red and green splotches because it was make with red and green jello. It's set and stiff and kind of cold, but cakey too. Take this jello cake and throw it into a trifle with the pudding or syllabub and fruit, even the best fruit and you've got a heterogeneous trifle, partly British, partly American, sweet, but slightly odd and uninspiring. 5/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"
28,Flushed Away,7,23 May 2007,Charming movie but is not quite up to the standards of the Nick Park movies (Wallace and Grommit),"When I heard about ""Flushed Away"" from Aardman animations I was expecting a lot! It was being connected to ""Wallace and Grommit and the The curse of the were-rabbit"" (from Nick Park)! Sadly I have to report that Nick Park (other than a cameo as a slug's voice) has nothing to do with this movie! (Look at the credits if you don't believe me)! And it shows! The animation is great,the voice acting is superb! But something is lacking! And that is the typical British humor! The double meaning are gone! That doesn't mean ""Flushed Away"" isn't good! It is quite charming and entertaining! Only people will be disappointed if they expect something like the Wallace and Grommit productions! It is a good thing they put in singing slugs! They give that extra comic relief what is needed! Give it a shot!"
29,Flushed Away,2,9 December 2006,A real pain to watch for the grown-ups,"Ultimately too silly and pointless. Yes there is the gilded cage metaphor but probably most kids would miss that. Forgettable. Instantly.Animation is, as we have come to expect, super-real. The plot-line could best be described as thin but tenacious. Although the ending seemed arbitrary to me.The sewer underworld is a suitably disgusting reflection of the world above and, somehow, wealth and money seem to count for a lot there too. Oh yes, and there's a romantic interest with the female being the smarter, more savvy and go-getting of the pair - this in itself is rapidly becoming a tiresome (anti) stereotype. Probably your kids will love it though."
30,Flushed Away,,6 December 2006,fantastic fun,"there is so much to recommend about this film.From the opening scenes in which Hugh Jackman finally gets to play James Bond through to the chase sequences in the underground waterways of London Flushed Away represents the love,energy and British wit of Aardman animation.There are a number of moments which caused this adult reviewer to laugh out loud..including singing snails, Sir Ian McKellen's homage to Larry Grayson and a French mime artist on a cellphone..literally.The cast are all excellent with Hugh Jackman almost recognisable as the voice of Roddy and Jean Reno displaying comic talents that I would never have guessed at ( especially after the Pink Panther).There are so many jokes and ideas tucked away that you need to see the movie at least twice to take them all in.Genius"
31,Flushed Away,6,15 November 2006,Egregious Vermin,"Greetings again from the darkness. A bit more British humor would have taken this one to the next level. The voice acting and animation are first rate, but more attention to the script would have meant a lot here.Hugh Jackman (Roddy), Kate Winslet (lovely Rita), Sir Ian McKellan (The evil Toad), Jean Reno (Le Frog) and especially Bill Nighy (Whitey) are all excellent as mice and frogs/toads. Nighy's character is something straight out of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"".The animation provides plenty of action and there are a few visual gags along the way (books, doll clothes, DVD titles, etc). The film offers a tip of the cap to ""Total Recall"", ""Waterworld"", ""Finding Nemo"" and many others ... although it did leave a few in the bag.Don't think this one really has the appeal to younger kids that turn these animated creations into mega-hits, but it won't be miserable at all for the parents and grandparents that end up taking them."
32,Flushed Away,8,31 October 2006,"Good, clean fun","From the creators of ""Wallace & Grommitt,"" this is a CGI masterpiece; from the goofy rodent and frog characters, to the wonderful storyline to the dozens of pop cultural references and throw-a-way gags, which remind one of the sharp writing in ""Hoodwinked."" Roddy (voice of Hugh Jackman) is an uptown rat belonging to the little girl of upscale parents in Kensington, England. The family leaves on a trip one day, however, and he finds himself flushed into the sewers of London, where he must learn to exist in a subterranean world run by a ruthless Toad (Ian McKellan) and his hilarious rodent hencemen, Sid and Whitey (Shane Ritchie and Bill Nighy).Wanting desperately to return to his life of comfort and ease, Roddy enlists the aid of a tugboat captain, Rita (Kate Winslet), to take him back to the surface.But complications arise when Rita steals a ""main cable"" which controls the city's floodgate ¬ñ a device the Toad will do anything to get back ¬ñincluding sending a group of French frogs (get it?), led by Jean Reno (""The Pink Panther"").Plenty of laughs, despite the Englocentric humour, this may actually give ""Cars"" a run for its money come Academy Award time. This toilet comedy is good clean fun for the whole family."
33,Flushed Away,4,7 November 2006,The project seems hacked together,"Flushed Away reviewed by Sam OsbornIt seems as though Dreamworks Animation and Aardman Studios have called the plumber to fish this humble dud from the sewers. It was supposedly put there in the first place, upsized by the delicious clay morsel, Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were Rabbit, and put on hold indefinitely. But since the British clay detectives made for box office success last Halloween, the likes of Flushed Away were sucked back up to ground level for a quick and hearty cash-in. The results have worked, it seems; with a hefty box office pull raked in this opening weekend. But as much as the audiences will hope for another British gem of novelty and quirk, they'll be in for something far, far more diluted. It's the tale of Roddy (Hugh Jackman), a groomed and sophisticated mouse living comfortably in a London home as a pet. His friends are Barbies and GI Joes and his owners have left him to them for a week away on vacation. It's shaping up to be a raucous week with his plastic housemates until his toilet gurgles up Sid (Shane Richie), a disgusting sewer rat who tricks Roddy into being flushed away. Down the pipe and away from a strangely bright and sunny London on ground level, Roddy is thrown into a bizarre mock-up of London beneath ground, inhabited entirely by mice. There he meets Rita (Kate Winslet), a sassy treasure hunter on the run from Toad (Ian McKellan) and his nasty cohorts, who secretly plan to annihilate the underground mouse population. Swept up in adventure, Roddy clumsily makes his way aboard Rita's boat, the Jammy Dodger, and speeds away to save the sewer from its diabolical, wart-ridden foe.All this hurtles at us with surprising velocity. Despite clocking in at a full 86 minutes, Flushed Away seems always to be in vicious rush. It's as though Directors David Bowers and Sam Fell are playing a game of hopscotch on a pool of lily pads with their film. They're aware their story's built on a creaky foundation of trodden clich√©s (despite the deceivingly quirky premise) and have a plan to rush through it all before someone has the gall to notice. But when the film occasionally stops to breathe and whet the raucous tale with a taste of story, the fun all comes to screeching halt. Fun, perhaps, is the wrong word for the experience, though, because Flushed Away's humor is by no means genuine. Where Wallace and Gromit's humor was mined from the charm of its characters and the quirk of its story, Flushed Away steals laughs from unexpected sound bytes and witty inside jokes with the adults. As a consolation, however, I'll admit to loving the chorus of singing slugs. For all my complaining, the slugs really were wonderful. The animation style is a CGI mimic of Aardman's claymation technique used in Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run. The absurdity is all there, with the ridiculous wide mouths that contract and explode horizontally like an anime character with a speech impediment; but the novelty of the style isn't. When animators work with stop-motion animation (Wallace and Gromit, The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Corpse Bride), each frame takes an absurd amount of time and labor. And because each frame takes so long, each frame is loaded with an amazing amount quirk and style. CGI animation (Cars, Madagascar, Over the Hedge), although no small chore, is a world away from the time-gobbling measures of stop-motion. The difference here is easily noticeable, as Flushed Away's mimic of claymation comes off more like a quick-fix solution to the years required to produce a stop-motion feature. And I suppose that's the feeling we get from Flushed Away in its entirety. The project seems hacked together; shoddy and boring in all its rough and tumble. Calling it a cash-in may be caddy and overstated, but Flushed Away fails even at being a Wallace and Gromit copycat. Rating: 1.5 out of 4Sam Osborn"
34,Flushed Away,6,3 November 2006,"Cute, but nothing stood out like the rest of the animation movies that were released this year","Flushed Away was one of the top movies I was looking forward to for the November releases. The trailer was just awesome playing E.L.O.'s Don't Bring Me Down and this movie looked like non stop laughs. Not to mention the great animation and terrific cast, like Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet. While the animation was great and the movie had terrific laughs and fun moments, Flushed Away seemed like just another typical computer animation flick.Rody is an indoor pet rat that is pampered like crazy, he's used to his life of luxury. When his family goes away on a trip, a sewer rat gets into the house and kicks Rody out by flushing him down the toilet into the depths of a rat city just like London. But Rody wants to get back home so badly, he goes to a boat that can take him back, the captain of this boat is Rita, a frisky little rat who gives Rody a hard time and they make a deal that if she can get him back home, he'll get her some valuable jewels that she can use for her family. But when she takes a wire from The Toad, a mob toad boss, she thinks it's useless, but it's for a wall that will unleash all the toilet flushes onto the city and help The Toad build a new city of his baby toads.I will never deny, I had a good time watching Flushed Away, I laughed more than a few times, but I just wanted something a little more special, since there are so many computer animation flicks. If we have done away with the regular animation, why not do something great with the computer effects? It's just getting to be so typical, that's all. But I think the kids will definitely get a kick out of Flushed Away.6/10"
35,Flushed Away,8,12 March 2007,very gross but also very funny!,"this was a wonderful film about a lonely but content pet rat (voiced by Hugh Jackman) who gets flushed down the toilet of his posh Kensington home, only to find love and his true identity in the British sewers. Rita (voiced by Kate Winslet) plays the tomboy sewer rat he falls in love with. The humour was a bit rude, especially the bit with the obese tourist American couple, among other things but it's also good fun. The singing slugs steal the show with their hot renditions of show tunes and cute humour. With all that water, ice & that Jolly Dodger boat, this must have felt like Titanic 2 for Winslet. Anywho, my favourite character was Rita's little brother(one of what looked like a million siblings) Shocky, that little darling had me in stitches. Featuring the additional voice talents of Gene Reno as Le Frog and Sir Ian Mckellen as The Toad, in sinister supporting roles. Suitable for family viewing. A-"
36,Flushed Away,7,5 January 2007,Generally fun,"Went to see this with my 8 year old daughter - and generally I enjoyed it. I wouldn't say it was the best film I saw and (for CGI films) not on the level of Shrek (for nasty humor :-) ) or the Pixar films (for depth and stuff). However it was just good fun.Both me and daughter really liked the scenes with the slugs and the french frogs. The animation is fine - nothing out this world - but does often look like the traditional Wallace & Gromit style which is nice. Again the story is pretty standard but its more the relationship between the characters which carries the film (along with how the city inhabitants have rebuilt London out of bits and pieces).From daughters comments I guess we will end up of the DVD of this in time (something that didn't happen with both ""Over the Hedge"" and ""Open Season"") so it's a nice film."
37,Flushed Away,9,24 December 2006,Really funny if you like slapstick comedy,"This film predominately is very funny if you like slapstick comedy, which I do happen to like. It appeals to most ages but in particular children under the age of 12, and adults under the age of 50. Not really worth going to the cinema to see but still worth taking a look at. The funniest characters are undeniably the main frog, played by Ian Mckellan, who you may remember played Gandalf in the Lord Of The Rings trilogies. It also includes Roddy, who is played by Hugh Jackman, who played Wolverine the X-Men trilogy. Finally, Kate Winslet plays Rita, who slowly but surely falls in love with Roddy. Overall, a very funny film with some very funny moments."
38,Flushed Away,9,16 December 2006,Two New Worlds for the Mice of One!,"Oh, it was a fair amount of fun, and added to the Nick Parks-ian world of animation and visuals with some head-on treatment of some surprisingly serious issues.The loneliness of the comfortable material life vs. the support and reassurances (and disadvantages) of the large family life get their treatment in a rather moving scene. The city-mouse hero, who was catapulted from comfortable isolation into a teeming, streaming water-world of the London Sewers (the joke where he clutches in panic what turns out to be a candy bar in his descent is priceless), sees through a closed window the heroine's teeming, oddball family and begins to realize that what he had, what he lost, what he wants to get back to--may not be worth very much. And he does have to make some very tough decisions.Some bracing profundtiy swirled in with a great many hilarious jokes and gimmicky schtick that you have to think back over to appreciate all the humor. The two amphibian villains--the Toad and Le Frog-- are caricatures that go right for the throat of British and French culture, but, no fear, we Yanks get a good pronging, too, and the Royals, and the Proles, and the Soccer fandom... As long as the guns rotate 360 degrees, I'm cheery.Two strange worlds--London's sewers, and lower-class English life. Lots of boats and some snappy humor and some shameless, glorious sight gags. Fairly good computer animation with lots of eye-candy, and a chorus of singing slugs. Yes, it stands out, it is not more of the same, and is good for multiple viewings. Just don't leave the seat up."
39,Flushed Away,7,3 December 2006,"This ""Flush"" is not crap","*i wrote this for my university's newspaper, so bare with the format, please!This past year has been big for animated movies. Hits like ""Cars"" and ""Open Season"" have been box office successes. So what exactly do directors like David Bowers and Sam Fell consider while trying to make ""Flushed Away"" stand out? For starters, it helps having a creative and original plot. And whether or not Bowers and Fell actually thought about gearing this movie directly towards kids, they were clever enough to add jokes that can be enjoyed by adults. Hugh Jackman voices Roddy, a sophisticated mouse who lives as a pet to an upper-class family in a Kensington neighborhood. When a sewer rat named Sid comes out of the sink, he immediately becomes keen on the lifestyle Roddy lives. In attempt to get Sid back to his home, his plan backfires and Roddy finds himself in the sewers. It seems there is a whole other world, which Roddy was never aware of, living in the sewers. Desperate to get back home, Roddy meets Rita (Kate Winslet), a scavenger who agrees to get him home in exchange for some of his families' (well, owners') jewels. Little does anybody know that this ""city's"" fate is doomed, as the villainous Toad (Ian McKellen) plans to unleash a wall that will leave the entire metropolis flooded. And since Rita has taken the wire needed to do so, she and Roddy are forced to take a detour on their way up top, to avoid running into Whitey (Bill Nighy) and Spike (Andy Sarkis), employees of the Toad. After seeing this ""city"" where rats live freely, and witnessing Rita with her family, Roddy feels lonely and questions whether he belongs on top. ""Flushed"" is a creative and well-written animated film. A film well suited for every age, I will admit that I laughed on more than one occasion. With a cast whose voices were both playful and energetic, they were easily able to charm the audience with their witty one-liners. In fact, ""Cars"" may have some competition come time of the Oscars. Although I question the mad rush of animated films, ""Flushed Away"" is one that is definitely worthwhile."
40,Flushed Away,7,2 December 2006,Best animated film this year!!,"Aardman Animations are best known for Creature Comforts and, of course, Wallace and Gromit. After they joined forces with DreamWorks to produce features films, they came up with Chicken Run and last year's Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. And now we have their first CGI animated film, Flushed Away. Well it isn't as good as The Curse of the Were-Rabbit: It's better. Much as I liked the inventiveness which Nick Park has brought to Wallace and Gromit, the Curse of the Were-Rabbit dragged in a few places, despite its short running time. It seems as Wallace and Gromit are best suited to a short film rather than a full-length feature.Flushed Away, however, does not make that mistake. All the visual inventiveness and Aardman ""look"" are all present and correct but aided by a script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais amongst others which means better lines and better gags. Toilet humour is almost a given considering the location of the story but crudity is kept to a minimum and this is definitely a film the whole family can enjoy, with adults and children able to find different things in it to enjoy. Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellen and Jean Reno give good voice and the whole thing zips by as quick as a flash. And despite the U.S. money and the fact it was made in L.A., it's a refreshing change to see a CGI film that has an English slant on things and clearly made by English people rather than an American's quaint and outdated view of England.And wisely, the result of the England v Germany World Cup Final, against the background of which the finale is set, sees England beaten on penalties. Quite right too. I'm prepared to accept talking rats and dancing frogs and a miniature city in the sewers but England beating Germany in the World Cup Final? Some things stretch credibility just that bit too far.It's a shame the critics have been so negative about this film. Aardman isn't just Wallace and Gromit and whilst this may not look as technically polished as Pixar's films, this is as easily as entertaining as the best of them. So ignore the bad reviews and go and see this for yourself. I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
41,Flushed Away,7,18 November 2006,"Original, but there's something I Didn't like...","Aardman, the company that created Chicken Run, and Wallace and Gromit, comes with a new film, which is bursting with originality and clever ideas all around, but with some lagging humor and a few overplayed jokes, it doesn't quite feel the same as when it was clay.The story is about a rodent named Roddy (Hugh Jackman) who finds that when the cats are away, the mice will play, and having fun has never been so good, until a fat rat Sid (Shane Richie) intrudes, and sends Roddy flushed away. Now that Roddy has experienced the good life, he learns how down and dirty the world beneath him is, and falls accidentally into a plot with a female rodent Rita (Kate Winslet) an evil Toad (Sir Ian Mckellen) and a journey home that will prove to be difficult, but friendship will lead the way.The movie is all in all fantastic, it's simple, easy to look at and overall fun. The voice acting by all the cast doesn't make them seem like a bunch of no talent voice actors that are often heard today. It's just the right length of time, so you won't be glancing at your watch, because your eyes will be lifted to the screen.However, there were somethings I didn't care for. For one, a lot of jokes in the movie are mostly aimed at adults, the other kind of jokes are those that are aimed for children, and it's mostly chaotic and often painful scenes (I.E. midsection groin smashes, smashes against objects, Etc.) and it's okay, but there's too many of them, but consider it the idea of Fart jokes in American Cartoons to these, The smashes are much funnier.Children under the age of 5 will not find humor or amusement in the movie, A number of kids in the movie were making noises, running through the aisle, and talking. I'm not referring to all of them, but majorities probably won't find this very fun.If there is one other thing I didn't care for much was the modern music in the film, which is large leap from their original, mostly composed music pieces. In the film, there are slugs, and the slugs sing. I thought the music was good, but it annoyed me that a lot of the music was somewhat almost forced into the movie, and sometimes it work, but others were just annoying.In short, the movie is okay, but Rental is much more worth it, avoid theater viewing."
42,Flushed Away,7,11 November 2006,"Well animated, nice plot, fun movie.","Stars: Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Bill Nygh, Jean Reno.Aardman animation has a reputation for making great movies and shorts (Wallace and Grommit, Chicken Run) and this movie was no exception. I found this to be a good movie, especially for children. It's about a pet rat Roddy getting flushed down the toilet while trying to rid the house of a sewer rat. When down in the sewer he finds a huge town and meets a girl and feels a bit less lonely. He gets caught trying to get back to his house, in a wild adventure with a mean toad and his henchmen. This movie didn't really have much of a plot, and many of the gags got annoying, but kids will enjoy it and adults will tolerate it. The kids will find the singing slugs funny, while the adults marvel over the excellently animated sewer mouse town.My rating: *** out of ****. 81 mins. PG for crude humor."
43,Flushed Away,,5 November 2006,Aardman's first CGI movie.,"From the people who made Wallace & Gromit/Chicken Run possible brings you an entirely different kind of British animation.The movie takes place in Kenslington, London, England. In the rich urban neighborhoods of Kenslington lived a family that's off for holiday. While they're gone, their pet rat, Roddy has the place to himself. He has everything to keep himself enjoyed day after day.Life was good for Roddy till a large sewer rat came out from the sink. He helps himself to some snacks and make a mess around the place. Roddy insists that the sewer rat goes back to where he came from, but the Rat decides to stay here. So Roddy tries to make the rat think that the bathroom toilet is a hot tub, so he could flush him down back to the sewer. Unfortunitly the rat wasn't stupid enough to fall for a trap. So Roddy ended up getting flushed down through the toilet and finds himself in a whole new world that's unlike Kenslington. The sewers are populated with slugs, rats, mice, and frogs.This movie is really good to see. It's done entirely in computer but it does have the same pastel look you'd find in Aardman's other works. You'll find many parodies and spoofs in this movie. As well as some parodies of Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit found in the backgrounds of many scenes. Not to mention trademark songs including Tom Jones.It's a fast paced movie, but never a dull moment, so you'll be highly entertained for more than an hour. This is also the first Aardman film to get a PG rating because of the bathroom humor and plenty of comic mischief. But it's perfectly fine for the family to watch. Since I do enjoy British humor, and this movie is pure British from beginning to end. So all you Aardman fans out there, consider seeing this movie. It's worth viewing."
44,Flushed Away,8,8 August 2017,Warning: This movie may cause irritable bowl movement due to excessive laughing.,"Yes, flushed away is an overlooked treasure. High-class vermin, Roddy, is a beloved rat who has it all: Expensive food, a nice car, a big house,a master bed, gold, jewels, a big family and a lot of friends. Sadly, his family is a human who locks him in a cage, and his friends are all dolls. Roddy may seem happy, but he is secretly a sad, broken rat inside, and is desperately alone, yet he doesn't know what he needs in life. His neurotic existence is shattered to pieces when Sid, a plump, vulgar, sewer rat shows up, and crashes on his turf. Eager to rid his palace of the obese, crude perpetrator of pestilence, Roddy attempts to give Six a royal flush, but Sid is simple, not stupid, and turns the tables on Roddy, sending him down the toilet, instead. Thrust into an underground world, Roddy must swallow his pride, form an uneasy truce with junk-scavenging Rita, a pirate who scours the underworld to find enough treasure to scrape by. She begrudgingly agrees to help Roddy, for a hefty fee. Their quest is hindered by two gangsta rats, an insane, speciecist toad who harbours an intense hatred of all rodents and has a dark agenda to destroy the underworld, and a xenophobic frog from France. What it amounts to is an insanely funny, fast-paced adventure, that keeps you laughing all the way through. From the singing slugs, to various sight-gags, this movie entertains all ages, and has a BIG cast of funny characters. Being from aardman, the plot is erratic, but in a good way, as events and circumstances change, and it never follows a set path. I highly recommend it. It avoids clich√©s, and being formulaic, and fires obscene premises towards the viewers. This loud, dazzling, movie promises to entertain."
45,Flushed Away,8,15 December 2016,"""England's winning! Anything's possible!""","British clay animation geniuses Aardman Studios strike gold yet again with this frantically funny comedy, their first to be done by computer. Roddy St. James (voice of Hugh Jackman) is a pampered pet mouse who gets to see how the other half lives when he is flushed down the toilet by rascally sewer rat Sid (voice of Shane Richie). He must join forces with Rita (voice of Kate Winslet), skipper of a garbage scow, to evade the minions of amphibian underworld kingpin The Toad (voice of Sir Ian McKellen).""Flushed Away"" is both a verbal and a visual delight, with an engaging, consistently amusing script and those wonderful, unique Aardman character designs. Adhering to the tradition begun by Pixars' ""Toy Story"" back in 1995, there is plenty of humor for both children and adults. As a result, older viewers should be roaring with laughter as often as the little ones. It's got great energy, and pace, and a solid soundtrack (ranging from Billy Idol & Generation X, to Jet, to Tom Jones). Priceless gags include the constant appearances of singing slugs. The material has real heart (but never goes overboard with sentimentality) and the characters are endearing from start to finish. Voice talents also include Jean Reno as dapper Le Frog (!), Bill Nighy and Andy Serkis as The Toads' rodent henchmen, and Kathy Burke, David Suchet, and Miriam Margolyes as Ritas' family. The animation is absolutely stunning throughout.The filmmakers do know how to send you away with a smile, with a brilliant gag to conclude the end credits.Eight out of 10."
46,Flushed Away,8,29 September 2016,"Witty and High Energised Family Fun,","Flushed Away is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific voice cast. It is a ridiculously fun film for the entire family as we follow a mouse who is flushed down the toilet and sets off on a wild adventure to get home. The characters are all very unique and well established by the writers. Roddy is layered to an extent, as is Rita, while The Toad's objectives are always made abundantly clear. However, the film is lacking in heart that I have come to expect from these animated films. It has no type of warmth that features in classics like Toy Story or Shrek, and its absence keeps it from standing out as much. The voice cast is top notch, not merely being used to give this film more publicity. They really put effort in to their voice work, with Hugh Jackman leaving no trace of his Australian accent, Jean Reno putting on a French accent much more exaggerated than his own, and Andy Serkis truly embodying a henchman in his role. I feel the film shows that these movies do not need to be layered and give some type of thought provoking message in order for it to capture people of all ages, it merely has to be entertaining. While Flushed Away may be more forgetful than Aardman's previous work, you will enjoy the ride while it lasts, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. A mouse is flushed down the toilet and teams up with a sewer mouse to find his home."

But when his brother accidentally flushes him down the toilet he ends up in a sewage and meets up with other species like himself. He later meets a no nonsense rat called Rita(voiced by Kate Winslet from Titanic)who helps Rodney out in his new surroundings and of course come up face to face with a villain(voiced by Billy Nighy from Love Actually). But will Rodney ever find his way home or will he stay with Rita?Bottom line I really enjoyed this film because of Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet. I try my best to watch them in their movies as often as I see them on TV as they are both great versatile actors and having worked together a few years later in another movie(which I am not gonna mention but it does remind you of Valentines Day with all the big stars in it nuff said)they are really good actors. The animation is in the same style as Wallace and Gromit(Clay Animation)but still it was good animation too. Is it the best animated film I have seen no,but still if you are a fan of the stars then check it out. Like I said the voice acting is very good in this movie as Jackman doesn't use his actual voice(he only used his own voice in Rise Of The Guaridans).Bottom line I give it a thumbs up.C+"
48,Flushed Away,7,3 November 2013,Fun,"Roddy (Hugh Jackman) is a high class mouse living in the lap of luxury. When sewer rat Sid gets in, Roddy gets flushed down to the sewers. There he meets Rita (Kate Winslet) working her scavenger boat. They are harassed by the henchmen of the Toad. Through Roddy's bumbling, they find Rita, her boat, and the ruby that she was trying to hide.Aardman is trying a fully CGI feature film. It has the same feel and the same sensibility as their normal fare. If you like those, you'll like this one. The lead characters are likable, and the story has a lot of fun as long as you don't dwell on the fact that most of it takes place in the sewer."
49,Flushed Away,9,4 April 2007,Flushed away - another classic,"I was a bit hesitant at first, when seeing Flushed Away last night, but I found it clearly bested anything animated I've seen for quite a while, on par with Finding Nemo, actually!The story develops well, the actors chosen for the English voices are among my favourites, and there is little to comment when it comes to the animation - amazingly close to clay figures, and very Aardman! And those snails were very cute!Lots of references to other films and children stories doesn't hurt, the pun about Le Frog worked perfectly, and Mr Toad, is as Mr Toad always been, if a little larger, and a little more evil! With a female heroine it is very up to date, and that the male lead character is a bit dumb, is just as PC as it can be. That she has what seems to be a billion sisters and brothers, is a little overdone, but this is a saga about mice, so I don't mind! How dad manages to earn enough to feed them is a mystery, specially as he's totally in cast, and sits in a wheel chair (he probably got a good insurance plan?)!When being flushed into the nether regions our hero hits his balls at least five times in a row - I can tell you that you'll have no new pain after the first time, so it is a bit over the top, but again as PC as can be.So, if the story was a bit less politically correct I'd give a full house, now it got only a nine out of ten!"
50,Flushed Away,,25 March 2007,"So good, I don't see how anyone could hate it .","A title like Flushed Away (title, not the real film) might have repelled people, but it didn't repel me, and I was not sorry. Brilliantly made from the creators of Chicken Run, Shrek, Shark Tale, Madagascar, Wallace and Gromit, and Over the Hedge, you would love to see a film like this. It is really funny and is actually the smartest film of last year. I saw a few stupid films last year like Benchwarmers, Click, and Talladega Nights (which were good, too). I thought that the funniest part of the film was when Spike got flung back, hit a bunch of bumps, and then got wound up in a bunji cord. But this retains its wittiness with elaborate plans to escape, rescue, and fight. Trust me, if you have yet to see Flushed Away, you should rent it sometime. Or even buy it! Yes, this film is really that good. You'll love it."
51,Flushed Away,7,16 February 2007,Respectable  animators finally get it completely right for the little ones,"Largely shunning plot, character development, and morality except when seamlessly inserted into the frenetic and unrelenting flow of action that dominates this computer animated joy, Flushed Away is a pleasing return to form for the proudly A.D.D., crowd pleasing no-brainer of a whirlwind adventure that never becomes bogged down in any of the ""seriousness"" that has helped change the landscape of these kiddie outings. Young ones will be tremendously pleased as the forward momentum begins from the get go and never seems to stop, always highlighting the extremely brisk pace with extra servings of humor (often with multiple jokes going off at once), fun-loving characters, and an awesome sense of movement and visualization. Not since the early days of Pixar has a little animated adventure felt so downright entertaining for young children, and it is to the team's credit that action remains the prime focus throughout, something that (especially for animated films) becomes easier said then done. As such, Flushed Away runs 84 minutes long, feels completely whole, and not a second too long. Granted, one could have a field day pointing out the ridiculously fast direction and argue how this makes the movie worse, but you will never hear that sentiment being debated amongst it's chief demographic. Taking place in England, though not to a point that will find American kids disengaged ala Wallace & Gromit, this same company continues to provide pertinent contrast to America's sagging edge in the computer animated market, this time taking their esteemed claymation approach and melding those visuals with rendering technology. Remind your child (or an inner one) of what cartoons used to feel like without all the guilt and heavy-handedness with this reaffirmation of animated animation."
52,Flushed Away,7,20 January 2007,"It may be digital, but it's still Aardman","Aardman's first foray into CGI rather than Plasticine was reportedly due to the fact that there are a lot of scenes involving water that would have been impossible to animate by hand. I'm not so sure, after all the combination of CGI and miniatures is commonplace in movies today (see X-Men, Superman, anything recent by Peter Jackson) and recent Wallace and Gromit productions have had a CGI element. Digital water might have been easier to add than they're letting on.The real reason for the move to digital was, I think, firstly that hand animation is extremely expensive with a very long production lead time that makes producers nervous. Secondly it was a test of whether Aardman design and humour (the 'brand', if you like) was strong enough to stand delivery through a variety of media.Well, the good news is that it is: after a few minutes it's easy to forget that the characters are pixels rather than Plasticine and just bask in the warm glow of this view into Aardman's universe. The voice work is first class throughout, with special mention to Bill Nighy as well as the leads. Although the movie plays with cultural stereotypes the characters are more rounded than many a live action movie and, more importantly, are for the most part undilutedly British.In the end the plot is of little consequence compared with the jokes and the details, but the movie never drags and has an interesting subtext of the value of social and ecological connectedness.I did miss the fingerprints though."
53,Flushed Away,7,5 January 2007,Will bear repeat viewing in the future...,"...if only to catch the myriad visual gags that make ""Flushed Away"" seem more like a rich compost heap than a sewer full of anthropomorphic vermin. Aardman Studios has presented a genuine challenge to the achievements of Pixar with this film, and I, for one, look forward to the coming triumphs of both studios as the nourishing exchange of creative energies drives them to continually improve their storytelling and dazzle us with the finest animation their imaginations can conjure.I caught this one just recently on second run, and even though my local cheap seats bumped their price, it was still entertainment budget well spent. ""Flushed Away"" may suffer a hair from ""videogamitis,"" in that it's chock full of obstacle course chases and mazes (somewhat to be expected in a sewer system, I suppose), but there's still more than enough droll British humor and amusing character interaction to keep one from checking one's watch. The voice work is delivered with great relish by the likes of Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet (refreshingly using her own accent, near as I could tell), and Ian Mckellan in spirited high dudgeon, along with Jean Reno, Bill Nighy, Andy Serkis, and Shane Richie in able and hilarious support. The CGI animation is amazingly faithful to Aardman Studios' Claymation¬ô masterpieces, yet retains a certain digital fluidity that sets the world of ""Flushed Away"" distinctly apart from ""Wallace and Grommit"" or ""Chicken Run."" Thankfully, though, they've kept the trademark Aardman eyes. Ya gotta love those eyes.The only weakness I could spot was that a good deal of it seemed aimed above the heads of the small children who might have otherwise filled seats. Sure, there's plenty of pratfalls and other sorts of cartoon mayhem suffered by indestructible Toons, but much of the dialog is obviously meant for a more literate sensibility (the Kafka sight gag was priceless). Discerning adults will be pleased at the relative dearth of bathroom humor, no rare feat in a film set in a city sewer system fed by millions of toilets. The moral messages, such as they are, are unforced and relatively unobtrusive. It seemed apparent that the makers of ""Flushed Away"" simply wanted their audience to have a good time without the insult of being treated like lowest common denominator dolts.I'm hard pressed to say which I preferred, this one or the recently re-watched ""Over the Hedge."" I have yet to see ""Cars"" again, for that matter, and will have to reserve further judgment until I've given them all further attention. But I can say with confidence that ""Flushed Away"" will satisfy most animation fans.Unless, perhaps, they really, really hate singing snails."
54,Flushed Away,7,1 January 2007,"good, but something missing","I'm Australian, I love British humour, and although I'm a dad I thoroughly enjoyed other Aardman offerings like Wallace + Grommit and Chicken Run.But somehow, Flushed Away left me a bit cold. Perhaps because the plot was so worn and predictable (Will he get back? Will he get the girl? Will he save the sewer? Well duh!). Perhaps because the jokes were old (""Hey, let's pull out some French stereotypes for the frogs!""). Perhaps because the action wasn't zany enough. (The chases in the The Wrong Trousers and A Tight Shave were totally wacky and brilliant, but what was this in Flushed Away... a James Bond spoof? Yawn.) Perhaps because the characters, while likable, weren't lovable. And the bad guy wasn't evil enough for me to hate him, or comic enough for me to laugh at him.On the plus side the first 10 or so minutes are great; there was some nice comic relief from some of the minor characters (the evil henchmen, the grandmother and the slugs); and there was a little (though perhaps predictable) twist at the end.So I had a reasonable hour and a half but, for whatever reason, I felt like it could have been a whole lot better."
55,Flushed Away,7,29 December 2006,"Amusing. Resembles, but doesn't live up to, earlier  Aardman work","First, is this movie weird, or what? Imagine the concept pitch meeting, when some eager Hollywood type eagerly pants with excitement as he proposes the idea of some rats and frogs riding turds around the London sewer system. Odd. But it is entertaining. Do note that it is very scatological, and sometimes even disgusting--- but in the name of experimenting, and having fun, why not? I am an American living in the UK. I'm no expert, but in my opinion the jokes and remarks in 'Flushed Away' would have equal appeal on both sides of the Atlantic. Yes, Americans may not know that 'England loses on penalties' is a real life clich√© and heart-breaker over here--- but savvy audiences would nonetheless get the joke. The rest--- such as the frogs all being French, and when their team leader yells for 'Action!', they all throw their hands up and shout 'We surrender!'--- everyone will understand.There were kids in my audience, but missing in the theater was the hysterical laughter and glee normally associated with a great kid movie. Maybe they were amused nonetheless? Maybe they were entranced, and were too engrossed to make comments? After all, I was not aware of them squirming, nor asking about what they would do after the film, etc. So maybe kids did like it. Dunno....As an adult, I can say that this resembled an Aardman production some of the time. Other times it only looked like a cartoon. Overall, I have to say that it did NOT live up the charm and artistry of previous Aardman claymation work.The voices were first rate talent, and the humor was amusing enough. Overall, I liked it. But, it was not of the rich, see-it-three-times-to-get-all-the-jokes multi-layered variety, such as Shrek and Toy Story. Oh well. I gave this a considered 7 out of 10. Maybe it deserves an 8? I didn't go there, however, because I was not that excited about it."
56,Flushed Away,9,12 December 2006,Well Done Aardman.,"Thats all i have to say, the transition from clay-motion to animation is fantastic, and they still make it look a lot like clay motion. The jokes are extremely visual, which isn't cheap i don't think, i think its fantastic, and music was a big input to the comedy factor of this film.The characters were great, with lovely little fill in ones like the slugs, the french frogs, and more. This film was also very meaningful, and was so much more than an animated Rom com, which is what it could be percept ed as.Well all that needed to be said is that i was laughing my head off through this film and not just Wallace and gromit fans should see this. This is for all."
57,Flushed Away,7,29 November 2006,Not Bad,"For a movie from Aardman animations, a studio with such high prestige in the world of animation, this film has so far attracted some fairly negative reviews. In many ways, they are justified - this doesn't come up to the standard of Wallace and Gromit. But, while it certainly isn't great, it is by no means bad either.When released, Chicken Run - also from Aardman - attracted glowing reviews. It was the first big-screen movie Aardman had ever produced, and went down well with the viewing public. Flushed Away, in contrast, has been labelled as 'so-so', but consider this - if this was Aardman's first feature instead of Chicken Run, the reviews may have been the other way around. Aardman, in making Wallace and Gromit, have set themselves a very high standard to meet. I found Flushed Away, while it did little to stand out from other animated films such as Shrek or Finding Nemo, also did little wrong. The story was was fun enough to enjoy without trying to be cleverer or deeper than it is. The characters were engaging, with Hugh Jackman's lead the highlight of a very strong cast - with the possible exception of an uncharacteristically poor Kate Winslet, all vocal performances were excellent. The jokes are typical of Aardman, good honest fun - few laugh out loud moments, but plenty of smiles and chuckles.Flushed Away has attracted publicity for being the first Aardman feature to be created using CGI. This switch from clay has been likened to Dylan going electric - the difference being, fans who see this movie won't be complaining. The production is handled superbly, somehow maintaining the charm and character of the previous stop-motion animation while introducing polished and impressive visuals - London from the air is recreated using CGI with stunning effect. While I hope Aardman do continue to animate using clay, I won't be disappointed to see more CGI pictures rolling off the production line either.In conclusion, this movie, although not the best offering from Aardman, is still worth going to see. If asked to give a rating in terms of other animated films, I'd place this one just behind Finding Nemo. Take the kids too see this one, they'll be laughing all the way, and there's enough in there for you to get a chuckle or two out of it as well."
58,Flushed Away,8,26 November 2006,Laugh Out Loud Funny,"Flushed Away has to be Aardman's best film. It has Aardman's trademark British Humor and something unlike Aardman films: Computer animation and stop animation fused together.The Basic Overview: Roddy (Hugh Jackman, also in Happy Feet), a handsome mouse living in a penthouse, but with no real friends, is repulsed when a sewer rat named Sid intrudes into his home and when Roddy tries to flush him back, Sid gets the last laugh and Roddy is ""Flushed Away"" into a sewer town where a young lady mouse named Rita (Kate Winslet) captains the Jammy Dodger and lives with her many siblings, parents and Grandmother (Who is an avid fan of Tom Jones). Roddy is swept into helping her stop the Toad and his minions from an ingenious plot to flush the town of Rats away. Can they do it in time...and will Roddy learn to find a friend in Rita? This is by far Aardman's funniest and best quality animation yet! A perfect 10!"
59,Flushed Away,7,20 November 2006,Entertaining to be sure!,"OK, let's see - problems at work, issues at home - let's go see something mindless and funny! In this regard, Flushed Away fills the bill more than adequately.First, Aardman is known for the wonderful claymation work done in Wallace and Gromit as well as Chicken Run. This world, done in CGI, in far more complex - but with a good story, the mechanism of telling should not matter - and the story here is quite good, and the movie moves at a very fast clip, only slowing on occasion.Good humor bits - poking at the national stereotypes - British and French primarily - as well as the slugs, who provide excellent comic relief as well as sound effects.Overall, a nice film is you need a break - I don't know if it's suitable for the very young ones, but preteens and early teenagers should LOVE it, and any adults who happen by as well."
60,Flushed Away,8,19 November 2006,Cute movie and has some very funny moments,"This was a pretty cute movie. It had a lot of ball hitting, but that was really funny. The film stars Kate Winslet, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan, Andy Serkis, Bill Nighy and Jean Reno.Roddy (Hugh Jackman)is a mouse that is living the high life, until someone pushes him in the toilet and he is... well, Flushed Away. There he meets Rita (Kate Winslet) a mouse who is trying to keep her ruby out of the hands of the evil Toad (Ian McKellan)and his 2 henchmen (Andy Serkis and Bill Nighy). At first, Rita and Roddy hate each other, but after a while they start to work together and spend some quality time together. But the Toad won't give up and he hires his cousin (Jean Reno) to capture the 2.This movie is well done. It has funny moments and likable characters. The slugs singing ""Mr. Lonely"" was funny even though I can't stand that song."
61,Flushed Away,9,18 November 2006,Great for humans 5 and above,"Although they say the film is about 84 minutes long, it feels like it goes by in 60.You can read all about the visual appeal and kinetic energy of the film in the mainstream reviews. But, really, it's just so much fun. The comedy in the film might be characterized as gleeful lunacy, with unexpected moments of bite that might make adults in the theater wonder whether the kids are enjoying it as much as they are.But, not to worry: I took my 6 year old daughter to see it and she wasn't scared by the action scenes, got the Nemo reference and laughed nearly as much as I did (I think I embarrassed her a bit).You have to take your kids to this. It's a treat for both of you."
62,Flushed Away,8,18 November 2006,As much fun as a good computer game,"Flushed Away is a highly entertaining and spirited comic adventure that explores the traditional theme of what happens when a highly civilized man (or, in this case, rat) is forced to survive in a new and relatively hostile world. As is traditional in this genre he flutters about helplessly for awhile before ultimately proving himself a hero. What makes FA remarkable for this genre is its tremendous enthusiasm and energy. The plot is non-stop razzle dazzle roller coaster ride in which one challenge follows another with hardly a moment to catch one's breath. Whatsmore, it achieves the rare feat of being simultaneously funny and exciting. It reminded me of nothing so much as a really really fun and funny computer adventure game."
63,Flushed Away,10,10 November 2006,"Rats, Another Animated Film","I somehow have avoided most if not all the summer's worth of animated films, simply because animated films have developed a penchant for potty humor. Literally, in some of these movies. So why would I want to see a movie that not all has potty in the title it's setting is in the sewer. Because I went with a kid who really wanted to see. Plus, I have been a Wallaceand Grommit fan since they first came out. I can't remember when Ilaughed so hard. Fortunately, we went on an off night and I didn't have to contain myself. There are hundreds of inside references to other movies from Stuart Little (driving a toy car) to James Bond (Roddy wearing a tux and watching a movie of similar title) and from there it's Finding Nemo (have you seen my father?) and beyond. The blend of crass American humor to English dry wit is fairly perfect. The singing slugs (remember the singing mice from Babe)could have been annoying, but they almost stole the show. Read the other reviews for the plot. I'm praising the wit, whimsy, and laugh out loud qualities of Flushed Away."
64,Flushed Away,9,9 November 2006,Flushed Away was an unexpected treat!,"Just got back from seeing Flushed Away. I had low expectations and went just for my kids, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. Animation, voice talent and most of all the unending cultural references made me laugh out loud. (I must say that the political jabs at the French got several cheers from the audience around me!) The British humor and in-jokes were perfect, and the underground London set was nothing short of inspired. The music was perfect, and both my girls and I walked out singing and laughing. I can't wait for the DVD, as I know there were many jokes that just went by too fast for the first viewing.And most of all, I want some of those slugs to sit on top of my computer - they were hilarious!"
65,Flushed Away,3,1 November 2006,Below average kid film... avoid it if you're not into bland and cheap,"Just got back from a free screening and I'm very glad I didn't pay to see this very sub-par film. The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults. It seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap-stick and fart jokes though (good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot!). The movie is pretty juvenile, unintelligent, predictable, and mostly annoying. The characters just seem to be thrown together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at all.Visually, the film is about average with nothing that really stands out. They did a decent job of mimicking the clay look from Wallace and Gromit, but other than that it's very forgettable imagery.Although I was really bored throughout the whole film, I chuckled a couple times. It's not an absolute failure, but I most definitely would not want to watch it again. If you're a parent with kids (and you don't care that your kids see mindless cheap-jokes) then feel free to take them to see it, but everyone else shouldn't waste their money."
66,Flushed Away,3,4 November 2006,Yawn....,"I wandered into this movie after watching the 82-minute ""Borat"" tonight, and left quite disappointed. I was a huge fan of Wallace and Gromit, and routinely go to see animated films. That being said, I found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out, but stayed waiting for this film to get better. Never happened.The visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch, especially in my opinion, that of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie for me is it's one of those animated features for the ADD-set. It registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another, weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an ""Important Message."" It looks a lot like busted Oscar bait for the animated category, and considering the way it's scoring with critics, I wouldn't be surprised if the Academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware. But if you're looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille."
67,Flushed Away,,4 December 2006,Rat out of water story,"Snotty self important (but lonely) yuppie finds himself in a small community where family values reign and a feisty female is initially unimpressed. If that sounds familiar from Doc Hollywood, or more recently, Cars, then don't be surprised if everything about Flushed Away feels just as familiar. The story is identical, only replace Hicktown, USA with London sewers, and Big City, USA with Kensington.Within the framework of that type of story, Flushed Away lazily delivers its gags, pop references, wacky sidekicks, insane but quirky villains, and the usual set of gags about body functions. It's run of the mill, computer animated and possibly computer written family entertainment. Heavy on morals, light on originality.It's not terrible. It's just not very good, either."
68,Flushed Away,9,16 September 2014,Outstanding and Hilarious,"Roddy is a snobby, rich rat living a life of luxury while his beloved owners are away on holidays. One day Sid, a slobby, overweight sewer rat, comes up out of the drain and mayhem ensues, leaving Roddy flushed down the toilet and heading for a miniature London built by sewer rats out of everything humans have flushed.Roddy is terrified and disgusted by this new environment, and comes to meet Rita, a rebellious female sewer rat living on a lovable little boat with a toy robotic arm attached (the boat appears to be sentient, no idea how). Roddy requests she take him home and offers her money, but at that moment two rats, tiny Spike and former lab rat Whitey, both hit men in the city, show up and kidnap both rats. This introduces Toad, the large crime boss responsible for controlling much of the city. Rita and Roddy manage to escape, and despite their differences have to work together to help Roddy... yet Roddy, after meeting Rita's large welfare family, feels the strange need to help her out in return, and maybe he isn't as happy living ""up top"" as he thought he was...Okay, the title is Flushed Away, and the film involves sewers, so of course there's some mild crude humor but nothing that makes it too rude to enjoy. Nearly every character has something to like about them, there are various funny moments that don't rely on gross jokes to be entertaining, and the animation, especially of the rat-populated sewer London, obviously took a lot of work. The soundtrack was pretty good and I think it's a great example of original animated film."
69,Flushed Away,8,12 January 2014,An intriguing CGI that maintains the charm from other Aardman productions,"I saw this in the cinema when it first came out and I enjoyed it more than I did the trailer, which was funny but the film had more to it. Re-visiting this film today for the first time in a few years, I watched it in a different way than I ever did before by pointing out how London was represented as an underground sewer city (one of the key ideas of my London-in-film university assignment) and some patriotic elements.The animation here is not quite as exceptional as that in other Dreamworks (the 'Madagascar' and 'Shrek' franchise) and Aardman ('Wallace and Gromit,' 'Chicken Run') productions what with the odd jerky character movement and lip-sync but I liked how the characters were modelled to resemble those from the likes of 'Wallace and Gromit' and 'Creature Comforts.' The underground sewer replica of London was the most creative background but I also liked the view from the Thames as Roddy and Rita floated above it with the London Eye intact. My favourite characters are Roddy, Sid, Rita, the Toad, Le Frog and the amusing singing slugs, all of which are well-voiced by their respective cast members. The film has some clever links such as the opening shots of Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, Piccadilly Circus and Tower Bridge connecting to their underground sewer replicas and Rita's grandmother's love of Tom Jones leading to 'What's New Pussycat?' being played over the closing credits. In addition to 'What's New Pussycat?,' other highlights of the soundtrack were 'Dancing By Myself' by Billy Idol and Generation X, the backing track of Jet's 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl?' that plays as Roddy makes his way to the sewer, 'Bohemian Like You' by Dandy Warhols and, of course, the brief musical numbers by the singing slugs, especially 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' and 'Mr Lonely.' I also enjoyed spotting the pop culture references to James Bond (Roddy watching a fictional Bond-style movie called 'Die Again Tomorrow'), 'Finding Nemo' (the fish asking Roddy if he's seen his dad) and 'Mary Poppins' (a female rat selling fly food in a similar manner to the bird lady).Overall, this may not be Dreamworks's or Aardman's best but it has an original story, a suitable title, some clever links, a rocking soundtrack and some funny moments. 8/10."
70,Flushed Away,,2 February 2009,"Pleasantly entertaining animation, excellent McKellen","This film turned out to be solidly entertaining. The animation is a blocky Aardman-like, but done using CGI. The results are fine. The story is light, basically just an excuse for an adventure through London's sewers where there's an entire community of creatures living, Dickens style. Ian McKellen is tremendous voicing the villainous Toad. Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet are dependable as a pair of constantly bickering opposites who ultimately attract. There are some inappropriate Americanisms throughout the production, which otherwise retains a typically British sense of humor. Recommended.Overall 7/10"
71,Flushed Away,10,23 March 2008,"if you thought Wallace and Gromit in the Curse of the Wererabbit  was funny,","you will really love this film.what a riot it was.it's from Dreamworks and Aardman Entertainment,the same people behind Wallace and Gromit.it's hysterically funny and fast paced and exciting.i loved Wallace and Gromit in The Curse of The Wererabbit,but i thought this movie was even funnier.it's a bit more risqu√© with the humour,which adults will pick up on,and kids will of course love it.a lot of the humour is very cheeky.there is a bit of rude,and crude humour here.not only is the film funny,it also looks very good,technically.the choice of actors for the voices was brilliant.the whole thing is just so well done.for me,Flushed Away is a 10/10"
72,Flushed Away,6,7 January 2008,"""This bizarre obsession with rats; it is not good for you. You are becoming what we French call ""le fruitcake!""""","'Flushed Away (2006),' a CGI-animated film, was the result of a collaboration between Dreamworks Animation and Aardman Animations, whose previous successes include 'Chicken Run (2000)' and the various 'Wallace and Gromit' adventures. The movie was Aardman's first complete foray into computer animation, having employed stop-motion for their previous features, though the CGI images are cleverly designed to resemble hand-made models. The film concerns the underground adventures of urbane pet rat Roddy St. James (voiced by Hugh Jackman), who is flushed down the toilet and must battle countless hurdles to return to the lonely home that he loves. After fatefully meeting a vivacious female rat, Rita Malone (Kate Winslet), the two rodents decide to help each other succeed in their respective goals, but only if they can escape the clutches of the wicked Toad (Ian McKellen) and his witless cronies (including Andy Serkis and Bill Nighy, as well as Jean Reno as a French mercenary ninja frog).Though the animators have done a good job at crafting the characters to resemble stop-motion models, I can't deny that much of the charm of Aardman's previous films is unfortunately lost. Computer animation has come a very long way since the release of Pixar's 'Toy Story (1995),' but the images still feel very sterile for the most part, particularly if done incorrectly {'Ratatouille (2007),' another rat-orientated animated film, successfully captures a warmth that this film noticeably lacks}. The film's London setting, as well as numerous lines of distinctly British humour, give the film a certain personal appeal, but the contribution of DreamWorks Animation is, dare I say it, detrimental to the finished result, with more care having been taken with the animation than with the writing, which is very simplistic and predictable, and the story feels unnecessarily rushed. Nevertheless, the voice actors all do a very good job with what they are given, and Hugh Jackman is perfect as the cultured rat of Kensington who comes to learn that a perfect home is useless if there's nobody with which to share it.'Flushed Away' works primarily as a selected assortment of brief gags and cheeky wise-cracks, without ever connecting as a film of its own. However, the writers and animators have embedded so many popular cultural references into the story that you could probably watch the film five times and notice something new each time {for example, did you spot the reference/s to 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day,' 'Titanic,' 'X-Men' and 'The Empire Strikes Back,' to name a few?}. In any case, the film is an enjoyable way to pass an hour or two, and should keep both adults and children entertained, even though, for the ultimate animated movie about rodents, your money is best spent on Pixar's latest offering."
73,Flushed Away,10,30 July 2007,Aardman At It's Best!,"Well what can i say! BRILLIANT! This film is one of the best animated films i have ever seen! Forget Wallace And Gromit this is the best Aardman have ever produced. This story goes that a rat called Roddy has his house invaded by another rat and is flushed away down the toilet and there he meets the girl of his dreams,singing slugs,an evil frog,a ninja French frog and lots more humorous characters. Looking that this film was only a U, i thought this was going to be for babies, but actually it contains a lot of innuendo and lots of adult humour. This film i recommend for is for children AND adults. Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet star in this film and without them this film wouldn't of been so funny! Jackman does a great English accent considering he's Australian! Overall, Perfecto! A real fun and humorous ride! Flushed Away for me gets 10/10! You have to see this film! Once you have read this review please go down to your nearest Blockbusters or go onto Sky Box Office and watch it, NOW! Don't be put off because it is rated U.I Hoped This Helped!"
74,Flushed Away,,21 March 2007,Better and more fun than I expected!,"A truly delightful animated comedy from the same guys that brought us the claymation movies. Here we get to see the real London ""underground"", not simply the world of transportation, but the underground world of the sewers.Hugh Jackman voices the main character, a pet, caged rat called Roddy. When his family goes away for a few days, he lets himself out of the cage to have fun but soon a big, fat, sewer rat pops up from the drains, to wreck his solitude. Roddy tries to trick the sewer rat into the toilet, but instead he himself is 'flushed away', and soon finds himself in an underworld of little critters that looks like a miniature recreation of London above the ground.There he soon meets Kate Winslet voicing Rita, who owns a cool little boat. Her nemesis, and that of all the others, is Ian McKellen voicing The Toad. There are the mandatory French 'le frog' jokes, and Jean Reno is good voicing Le Frog. Others are Bill Nighy and Andy Serkis.The action is good and entertaining. The story isn't that important to me, but involved the old toad being angry the the Prince as a boy got a pet rat and flushed his toad into the sewers. Bent on revenge, he was going to use the half time of the big televised Britain and Germany soccer game to execute his plan, when everyone would go to the loo, and the mass flushing of toilets would flood the underground. It was up to Rita and Roddy to see if they could foil his plan."
75,Flushed Away,9,5 March 2007,Really quite good,"I never saw this until the DVD came out, and even then, it was an impulse purchase. I wound up thoroughly enjoying it.First, I should probably say why I initially resisted it... 1) The whole concept was unappealing. 2) A long-time fan of Aardman, I had been disappointed by ""W&G and the Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". 3) I knew that this was done with CGI in the style of claymation and that kinda turned me off.The concept proved much more appealing in its entirety than was evident in the trailers. The plot is serviceable, the casting and the voice talent are uniformly excellent. The plot is certainly better, and better executed, than ""Were-Rabbit"". The animation was top notch. To be sure it was highly stylized CGI to emulate claymation, but it worked brilliantly.Certainly, the characters are more believable and sympathetic than in ""Were-Rabbit"". Oddly enough, the ones who pretty much steal the show are the slugs who form a very bizarre Greek chorus.My wife used to babysit so we have lots of kids' videos - most of which we never watch now that we don't have kids around that much. This is one we will watch again. Recommended!"
76,Flushed Away,8,23 February 2007,Robbed of an Oscar nom,"Honestly, what were the Oscar voters thinking when they put MONSTER HOUSE on the ballot ahead of this gem.I won't give this a truly comprehensive review since others have done better jobs than I would at that. But I do want to point out the relationship between Roddy and Rita which reminds me of a present email relationship.Rita is a gem, a feisty and resourceful gal wonderfully voiced by Kate Winslett. Paired with the snobbish and lonely Roddy, we're given a relationship I'm sure many can identify with.Syd, Toad, Spike, Whitey were all great and well portrayed characters as well...I just enjoyed Roddy and Rita the most.Also to be noted is the very British humor all the way through.If you watch this, sit through the credits. They are entertaining and the final disclaimer about the slugs is terrific."
77,Flushed Away,8,19 February 2007,Underrated Surprise,"I knew little about this film when it first came out, and due to the premise I dismissed it as yet another 3D film that would most likely be filled with toilet humour.Working at Blockbuster, I saw the trailer for this in the store and fell in love with the screaming slug. It makes me laugh every time I see it. I decided to give the movie a go (it's a free rental for me) and was shocked at how funny it was. Although there certainly is a bit of toilet humour, most of the jokes are very sophisticated and aimed at an older audience (WE SURRENDER! and the Batman reference).I think this one only failed because of timing and competing 3D films.Man, I love those screaming slugs."
78,Flushed Away,9,18 February 2007,Look out for those slugs!,"Flushed Away is, without a doubt, one of the better times I remember having in cinema during 2006. The plot is the same old tale of an individual (Rodney the civilized mouse in our case) that gets literally flushed down to the toilet - and into a strange new world which he has to get used to. Oh, and if by any chance he manages to save the sewage from an evil toad - so be it.But enough about the plot, the real knockout in this film are the cute little singing and screaming slugs which appear over and over throughout this sweet CGI film. By doing so, they absolutely steal the show from Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet's dubbing efforts. But it's all good anyway.At the end of the day, even if Flushed Away seems a bit shorter or rushed compared to other animated features, you've got to see it for what it is: A film that's filled with color and genuine love ¬ñ a rarity in movies these days."
79,Flushed Away,7,9 January 2007,It's not a great movie but it's way better than a lot of animation films made in Hollywood,"I'm tired to see animated films with animals who talk a lot.When I went to see Flushed away,I knew it was with animals,but I went to see it with good expectations because Aardman produced this movie(Aardman produced brilliant animated films like Chicken run and Wallace and Gromit).Flushed away is the first time Aardman uses digital animation.Flushed away is not a great animation movie and it's not as good as Aardman's previous films...but it's fun,funny and way better than animation films made in Hollywood.The best thing about this movie is that the new animation technique does not take preponderance on the story.I mean,the film pays a lot of attention to the story and I liked that a lot because it's weird to see on a modern animation film.Flushed away does not fall in any conventionalism animated films have.Obviously,there are subjects like the respect,tolerance and diversity but it goes to a second take,leaving in the front the characters' personality and the script's humor.That humor goes from the slapstick(like a very funny scene which involves genitals)to funny references to popular culture.On other movies,that humor is irritant and predictable.But on Flushed away,that works as a complement because that humor comes from the main character's personalities and from the characters he found on his adventure.Creators of movies like Madagascar and Open season should understand that concept.The character's voices are perfectly chosen and my favorite performances are Ian McKellen's and Andy Serkis'.The frailty I found here is that the action scenes are not too good and they take out cohesion to the movie's structure.I understand that the directors put that to keep fun to kids spectators but the constant action scenes take out points to the story's development.Flushed away is not a great movie but it kept me very fun and it made me laugh.It's not the best thing Aardman did but it's way better than the crap animation films Hollywood makes.I recommend this movie to the kids and their fathers...they will have a good time in the theater.Rating:7.5"
80,Flushed Away,7,11 December 2006,"Aardman delivers, again","Aardman Studios is back with another humorous animation flick. This time not the clay puppets that everybody got used to, but with a fully computer animated film. But, do not despair, the animation is done in such way that it still looks like clay puppets.The story then. It all starts as Roddy, an upper class rat, ends up in the sewers under London. From there things start rolling, and rolling quickly in an adventure that will lead Roddy onto a new path in life. And what passes in the mean time? The stuff we have grown to expect from Aardman - fast paced action, brilliant facial expressions, jokes with words, expressions, strange characters and all.It didn't have me rocking in my seat all the way through as Wallace & Gromm-it and the Curse of the Were-Rabbit did, but it wasn't bad, not bad at all. So, Aardman delivers, again.7 out of 10 rats flushed through the toilet"
81,Flushed Away,8,2 December 2006,Viz brought to life,"For those who don't know it, Viz is a comic for grown-ups (well, almost) based on traditional British comics for children. It is the repository of utterly stereotyped characters, absurd plots, unlimited innuendo, and of course fart jokes. It's a great way of staying in touch with your inner child. This film marshals an extraordinary range of talent (the Wallace and Gromit and Shrek teams; the classic British sitcom-writing duo of Dick Clement and Ian la Frenais) to bring a Viz-type plot to the screen. The main characters are mice, frogs and toads, while slugs provide an appealing soundtrack. The plot contrasts the opulent but rather sterile life above ground in London's Royal Borough of Kensington with that in its sewers below. Sewer life is made to seem more attractive ¬ñ less anal, shall we say. The animation is of high quality, though it lacks some of the feel of the real plasticine used in earlier Aardman films. The voiceovers are exceptionally good. There are some wonderful details. And it makes you think about the obsession some people have with royalty. As the UK has stringent libel laws it's probably best not to try and speculate here if The Toad might have had a human model. I sniggered and chortled most of the way through, and the plot didn't flag. Eight out of ten."
82,Flushed Away,10,27 November 2006,Delightful entertainment for young and old,"As opposed to some reviewers' claims, this movie is just as entertaining for adults as it is for kids. I went with my boyfriend (we're both 24), and we left smiling from ear to ear.""Flushed Away"" exceeded my expectations in every way: a well-developed plot, detailed, eye-popping graphics, clever British humor, a talented voice cast, and a feisty soundtrack often delivered by hilarious singing slugs. It was a fast-paced movie, too; there were never any lulls or dead time. I was entertained from the moment the movie began until the credits rolled. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys animated movies. It is truly exceptional."
83,Flushed Away,3,22 January 2007,"You are all kidding, right?","Don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it.I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth I was bored silly. It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny. There were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it. Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just didn't work. My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep half way through. Also, the kids thought the character animation looked weird. I haven't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares.Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and like so many animated movies they throw out there, it has very little."
84,Flushed Away,1,30 April 2007,Only for the brainless,"Let's just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand: This is a very dumb film with an even dumber script, lame animation, and a story that's about as original as thumbtacks. Don't bother -- unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children. They might laugh, especially if they're off their meds. There's a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous -- not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with claptrap that cost approximately zero effort, but they don't even bother to break a sweat inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing. This film, frankly, ticked me off royally. Shame on you for stooping so low."
85,Flushed Away,,16 April 2007,little to entertain adults seeking more than anime',"Yes this movie has wonderful anime' detail and realism.Aside from that however, the movie fails from the beginning to create much interest in the main character, nor much about his identity or anything that might create the viewer's empathy or identification with the character.Therefore, his various encounters and adventures seem random, holding much continuity or interest in keeping one's attention, unless one is infatuated with all of the cutesy characters and silly songs.For an adult seeking some sort of entertainment, this movie is little more than visually high-quality background Saturday-morning cartoon material in its plot and storyline."
86,Flushed Away,2,21 August 2008,"OK, you are a fool.","Can anybody do good CGI films besides Pixar? I mean really, animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent all their budget on Hugh Jackman. Whatever their reasoning, the story truly did suck.Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat that is flushed down a toilet. Yeah I know, seems stereotypical. But then the sewer mimicked the ways of London - to an extent. Throw in a promise of jewels (????) and an evil(??) frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment.I would like to say something entertained me. Maybe the hookup in the movie? Or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship. But nothing did. It had the talent, but it blew up. D-"
87,Flushed Away,1,8 June 2008,Do NOT under ANY circumstances see this poor excuse for an animated film!,"Oh if only I could give this rubbish less than one star! There were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it! one was where a line or two from the song Don't Worry, Be Happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where Roddy fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the groin. That is it there was nothing more amusing than that, at least not for me anyway! Doctornappy2 is not right in saying 'Fans of the completely terrible ""Shrek"" might enjoy, but ""Wallace & Gromit"" fans will probably turn away in disgust.' As I loved Shrek 1 2 and 3 and I also love Wallace and Gromit. You see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching, this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get! The continuity mistakes were too big in number. Some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not. I won't point out all of the others, but here are a few more to see: When the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure Roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it. At one point the ruby falls down Roddy's back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by Rita all the while the ship is moving forwards. In the next scene Roddy has caught it again. This is impossible. Seeing as how the ship is moving forwards the only place when the ruby was ejected out from under the back of Roddy's shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in Roddy's hand. There was a third one I wanted to point out but for now I have forgotten it.Too many, for want of a better word, 'jokes' were repeated in one way or another, there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters, the characters were hollow, shallow and empty, and the whole film left you wanting....wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else! Paint drying or grass growing are two superb options!"
88,Flushed Away,5,15 May 2007,not bad,"Roddy is a domestic mouse that lives a good life in a house of London. The arrival of Sid, a mouse from the downhill, will cause Rod to be flushed away through the WC, so he will have to discover a whole new world. There he will meet Rita and they'll have to be able to deal with each other in order to survive to the Evil ""Frog"" that wants to kill all the rats in London. Though being for kids and having a very-easy-to-follow-silly plot, the movie goes by in a so quick way that you have no time to become bored (the fact that it is shorter than 80 min helps, too). The history is thousands times seen and it has anything new, but it is not annoying. With more time could have been more developed, but then, the kids would get tired, so there's no way. Technically the movie is anything outstanding, just acceptable and the rhythm is very fast, so scenes go one after the other with hurry and doesn't let you time to get bored, which is pleasant. However, the story is not very interesting and the scenes are not heart-catching, so it becomes just, correct. Sometimes funny, it is not bad."
89,Flushed Away,5,8 April 2007,Less than the sum of its parts,"An Aardman feature by default starts with a score of 10 and then works down. Unfortunately, there are a lot of dings to award to Flushed Away, which add up to make it a curiously unsatisfying experience. In no particular order:The animation is surprisingly basic. In a post-Shrek world, I expect better far lip syncing and facial expressions. Yes, I know that it's supposed to mimic Aardman's claymation. That's not an excuse though; it's not a claymation and shouldn't limit itself to that medium any more than an oil painter should try to copy a crayon sketch.The characters are trite and derivative. All of them can be described in one sentence, including their 'backstories'. If you're going to have a mock-aristo toad as a villain, at least have the common courtesy to license Baron Silas Greenback.It's racist. Yes, it is. The humour merely masks the sneering, it doesn't excuse it.The humour is British. Very, very British; aggressively so, even. I'm British, and even I found it a little too self satisfied for its own good.Aardman still seem to compose their shots as though they're claymation, with lots of static cameras and close-ups. Even the action sequences are tentatively shot.The film is essentially a series of very funny vignettes, but the pacing and editing is lacklustre, and it feels both plodding and rushed at the same time. There's no real narrative drive, or sense of involvement with the cardboard characters.If all of this sounds like harsh criticism for what is essentially a fun family animation, then bear in mind that the film plasters its pedigree all over its promotional material, and so it must be compared with the best in class: Monsters Inc, Shrek and The Incredibles. Flushed Away is good, but it just can't run with the big boys."
90,Flushed Away,3,12 December 2006,"I came, I saw, I honestly didn't care for it...","A few months ago, I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this film. The poster insisted that if I gave 'Flushed Away' a chance, I would like it. Based partially on that argument, I agreed to watch the film.'Flushed Away' has good intentions (At least on Aardman's part), but lacks the strength to pull it all together. Its best asset is sewer rat/boat captain, Rita (Played by Kate Winselt), who, IMO, should have been the movie's main character instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita's cool, tough, and interesting, while Roddy spends much of his screen time sniveling.One of the things that bothered me most about 'FA' is the repetition of jokes that aren't funny to begin with. When Roddy gets hit in the crouch, the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately. ""My name's Shocky,"" says one of Rita's brothers, who then electrocutes Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time low.I won't waste time griping about Katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies toward Pixar (One similar film's a coincidence, five's a rip off.), but I will say I'm disappointed in Aardman. They can do (and have done) so much better. Try harder next time, guys."
91,Flushed Away,5,8 July 2015,Just not for me,"Flushed Away isn't the WORST Aardman film I've seen. I don't know WHAT is. But it's really not my favorite out of the Aardman Animations. I just don't like the toilet humor, or some of the characters. Yes, the voice acting is good, and the animation is incredible, but personally, I don't think it would be a great idea to make a movie about a mouse who got flushed. I've seen films worse than this. It's not REALLY Aardman's worst production (*coughs* Chop Socky Chooks), but it's just not my cup of tea. If you liked it, good for you, but I just consider it a mixed bag. In my opinion, it was considered CLOSE to being Aardman's worst film, but not quite. Although it looks better than Chop Socky Chooks, I just couldn't feel like watching it anymore."
92,Flushed Away,5,26 September 2014,not real coherence to the title,"The story opens up obviously, focusing on the main character and the clear fact that he's all alone. Then the conflict buildup follows, with all those unclear cause-effect relationship failed to be explained. Then the main adventure starts, only giving small emphasis to the movie's title. The rest of the story continues on quite unclear, not really minding the necessary details. The ending also proves to be severely unclear with the finale and conflict conclusion being too quick to resolve. Despite the big names in the voice acting cast, this movie really fails to deliver the best of them into the motion. Hugh Jackman sounded a bit younger than he really is here. Bill Nighy felt so underrated with his insignificant portion here."
93,Flushed Away,6,27 December 2013,Laminated animation doesn't kill the fun,"It's a film that's 10 years older than its spiritual time, the 1996 Europeans Football finals and the year that gave us New Labour's Cool Britannia. This is a knees-up-mother-Brown outing for the Aardman Animation team. The production takes the style and image of their famous clay stop-motion but render it in computer graphics. The story is about 2/3rds classic rescue drama with the rest chock-full of visual gags and references and wry asides that aren't just for accompanying adults. I lost count of the movie hat tips when I'd got past a dozen and the singing slugs never got dull.The voicing is superb, although Kate Winslet plucky Rita gets out charisma-ed by almost everyone else. It's not a 'real' Aardman Animation film but once you've absorbed the fact it's a good matin√©e romp. 6.5/10"
94,Flushed Away,7,22 November 2013,"Loads of fun, but less than the sum of its parts due to a charmless protagonist .","Beautiful animation. Loads of great secondary characters and engaging details. Non-stop visual humour of the highest order. I quite fell in love with Rita.It's all spoiled a bit by the protagonist Roddy - who seems to be modelled on the jejune, generic, wise-ass protagonists in '80s American teen flicks and TV. If they'd pushed that angle, to the point of making his character an over the top parody of Michael J. Fox, at the nadir of his entire career singing rock and roll in Back to the Future, it would have added to the film. Rita would have been a far more engaging central character. Instead, they've bottled out - doubtless a decision made for commercial reasons, but a bit disappointing from Aardman."
95,Flushed Away,7,12 July 2013,joy to watch,"what a wonderful family movie that anyone from age 9-99 can watch. I just love the story of rat who get's flushed down the toilet,, in the beginning of the film , he has the run of the place living on the top floor,, life is grand,, then his life goes down the toilet and into the sewer, from the penthouse to the outhouse with one flush, there he meets a bunch of other animal characters, and he tries to tell them the story of what really happened to him but of course to no ones surprise they don't believe him,, he spends the rest of the movie trying like mad to get to where he thinks he belongs,, which is back on the top floor living the life of luxury,, but getting there will not be easy as he has to overcome many obstacles.. again lot's of funny stuff , great laughs. .and a wonderful story."
96,Flushed Away,8,27 January 2012,"Probably the funniest, most complicated animated film I've seen","It is so ""adult"" in the sense of mature comedy, but you need to know what the references refer to. Those slugs are just adorable, but they're not like real slugs. It's so great, from the French frogs (don't miss the cellphone picture), to the tadpoles in jars who want everything, to the (Irish) siblings dancing on the boat, to all the inhabitants of the sewer city and all the inside jokes. When I first saw Roddy's closet, I knew this would be a spectacular movie. Maybe the best joke was ""Millicent Bystander"" -- I say it all the time! I wonder why there is no voice information on the DVD box. Were they all ashamed of the film? It's just one laugh after another and the drawings are wonderful! One of the best of all time."
97,Flushed Away,10,12 September 2010,"Simple, Fun, Entertaining and Surprising","I must say that every time I heard about ""Flushed Away"" for some odd reason I kept thinking that it wasn't a much interesting animation and things like that. I was wrong and I underestimated the value of it. It's a very funny adventure with a excellent soundtrack and a great ensemble casting makes the excellent characters voices. Roddy (Hugh Jackman's voice) is an uptown rat who lives in a big penthouse apartment, very happily until some poor rat shows up and flushes him down the toilet and letting him totally lost in the sewers of London. While trying get back home he's helped by a female obstinate rat Rita (Kate Winslet's voice) who wants to save the lives of many other rats persecuted by evil frogs led by The Toad (Ian McKellen's voice) and his French relative (Jean Reno's voice).High-spirited, entertaining and with lots of good jokes and a few cultural references ""Flushed Away"" is a very simple film but in the whole body of work delivers much more than it is expected. Despite a tremendous big plot hole towards the ending (but I think kids won't notice that) the story is well structured, without any excessive moments. The soundtrack's use was very good and one of the most memorable tings here working with classics of Billy Idol, Christopher Cross ""Sailing"" (I laughed a lot when the song was used in a romantically moment that ended hilariously when Roddy and Rita were being chased by the villains on the boat) and many other songs; and the music composed by Harry Gregson-Williams (composer from the Shrek films) is quite good too. If you enjoyed ""Chicken Run"" and similar animations from Aardman's (this is their first completely computer-animated feature) this film is for you. It's very enjoyable and highly recommended. 10/10"
98,Flushed Away,10,25 December 2009,The Best Computer-Animated Film You've Never Seen,"This is a superb animated feature from the guys who brought us Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit. It features an all-star cast, is devilishly funny and can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. However, it did not do very well at the box office. Why? Well, for a variety of reasons. The main one, in my opinion, is that it was killed by Happy Feet, which in no way lived up to its spectacular ad campaign. Funny how this movie is, in a way, just the opposite; it had a lousy ad campaign but is in reality a hilarious and remarkably entertaining movie.Despite an all-star British cast, this movie has the rather unappealing premise of a pampered pet rat who somehow contrives to be flushed down the toilet into an incredible world of sewer rats and their underground city. Now, at first this seems to be a premise that has gross-out comedy built directly into it. What the ad campaign regrettably failed to explain is that that premise only sets up the real one. The real premise sets up a cracking adventure story that features a gallery of hysterically funny characters and situations. What really amazes me about this film, however, is how constantly it entertains. There was not a single moment during this film in which I was not being totally entertained by its antics. Any movie that fills out its mission statement that effectively is worthy of recognition. However, this movie never got it, neither financially nor, to a certain extent, critically. Some might be kept away by the premise, or maybe the all-British cast, or maybe even because there are other films(like Happy Feet) they would rather see. Well, I am here telling you not to miss out."
99,Flushed Away,7,30 March 2009,Proves that Aardman and Computer Animation can work together,"Flushed Away (2006, Dir. David Bowers & Sam Fell) Roddy (Jackman) is a rat who lives in the best lifestyle possible, but when stranger Sid (Richie) appears, Roddy tries everything to remove him. Unfortunately for Roddy, not everything goes to plan, and he himself ends up in the sewers. Gaining the assistance of Rita (Winslet), Roddy tries to get home, whilst dodging the evil Toad (McKellen).Flushed Away proves that Aardman, DreamWorks and Computer Animation can work together, as this film is a colourful and hilarious delight to watch. The choice of voice talent is perfect and each voice and the well written script makes each character so identifiable and interesting.After a hard day navigating the sewer pipes, there's nothing better than relaxing in a Jacuzzi whirlpool bath. ¬ñ Roddy (Hugh Jackman)"
100,Flushed Away,7,27 March 2009,Witty and inventive!,"Flushed Away is very entertaining. Sure, it isn't the best animation in the world, but there was a lot to enjoy. The animation in general is very good, but not as good as Ratatouille. The story was a little bit thin, and sometimes failed to engage. Most of the jokes were genuinely very funny, however it had a tendency to overshadow the story. The french frogs were also very funny, but my favourite were the singing slugs. They were so funny every time they appeared. The voice talents were fantastic, especially Ian Mckellan, a fine recovery after his mistake, Doogal. Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet also brought a lot of much needed wit to their rather thankless characters. Bill Nighy and Shane Richie also delighted in brief but entertaining roles. The Tom Jones song over the end credits was nice to hear too. All in all, a witty and highly entertaining film. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"
101,Flushed Away,6,8 January 2009,Flushed Away,"Aardman Animations, creators of Wallace and Gromit, and Dreamworks computer animation, who created Shrek, bring the two together, might not be as charming as Claymation, but still fun. Basically Roddy St. James (Hugh Jackman) is the ""society mouse"" who lives in a posh Kesington flat. One day, a sewer rat named Sid (EastEnders' Shane Richie) comes up through the sink, and decides he's hit the jackpot, and after trying to fool him to go into the toilet and get flushed, it is Roddy that gets flushed instead. He has now found himself in the sewer city of Ratropolis, and to try and get back home, he meets scavenger rat Rita (Kate Winslet) who has the faithful boat, the Jammy Dodger. She is being is chased by Whitey (Bill Nighy) and Spike (The Lord of the Rings' Andy Serkis), who work for villain The Toad (Sir Ian McKellen). Originally they were chasing her for what turns out to be a non-valuable gem, but now she has his cable that controls his machine that opens the flood gates, and he plans to drown all during the World Cup match. Rita does manage to get Roddy home, after more chases, including with Le Frog (Jean Reno), but he realises The Toad's plan, and goes back to both save Rita and the rat city, oh, and in the end, he stays, while Sid stays above, and has a new feline friend. Also starring Kathy Burke as Rita's Mum, Poirot's David Suchet as Rita's Dad and Miriam Margolyes as Rita's Grandma. Filled with some good (if a little droll) British humour, most giggles coming from the singing slugs, it is a good film for all the family. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Animation. Good!"
102,Flushed Away,8,2 January 2009,It was totally Fun and Awesome,"The movie was totally fun and awesome. The Toad looks like a pucca Villain. Amongst the rodents, Roddy was very funny and cute. The last Scene was totally awesome and thrilling. When, the bad guys are chasing Roddy and Rita, that scene is totally awesome and cool. Even, the boat Was totally awesome and cool because the features of the boat was awesome.Even, the house of Roddy and the town in the sewer is very Beautiful and colorful. Even, the songs of the slugs are beautiful and superb.Even, Sid looks cute and cuddly.Even, Spike and Whitey is also Funny and the house of Rita and her family is also funny. I should really appreciate The creators of ""Flushed Away""."
103,Flushed Away,,21 July 2008,Amusing ... albeit  a little gross!,"I was a little turned off by everything happening in the sewers (green liquid - yuck!), but outside of that, it was a pleasant movie. If you like the Wallace and Grommit animated movies, then you'll probably love this one. While I'm not too big a fan of those movies, I ended up being nicely entertained anyway.The strengths of the movie are the animated characters (their voices, mannerisms) and the colorful visual sets. The story also moves along at a brisk pace which helps keep one's attention.Basically, the movie is about an upscale pet mouse that is flushed down the toilet by a rowdy invading mouse. He meets female mouse named Rita who is on a quest to recover a stolen item; he helps her in exchange for her help in returning to his home.The voice performances are just fine, but the story and visuals are what keep the movie interesting. For example, those funny slug-like bugs that are everywhere, the intricately detailed mouse city, and way each mouse is dressed are things that are pretty amusing to see. The story, while a bit simple, has something happening all the time so there rarely any lack of energy on-screen.I think this movie is a good bet for most people that are looking for a light and pleasant bit of 'cute' entertainment."
104,Flushed Away,7,29 June 2008,A good mixture of two animation companies.,"To make a fun, hilarious and entertaining animated film, Aardman and Dreamworks teamed up to make ""Flushed Away."" All the characters look like Aardman plasticine creations, but they are computer animated, which is a little unnerving for the first five minutes or so of this film, but then it becomes very good.I like this film because of the sweet rats, the jokes, all the characters and the plot. The whole film has been done very well and it is very good for young children and old adults. As I have said before, the animation works very well for the film. Oh yes, the scenes of London are very good as well, a change from the settings of films in the U.S.A.In this film, we are acquainted with a rat called Roddy, who lives in a huge house in London - in a huge golden cage. He claims to have a great deal of fun, but he has no other rats to live with. Then, one day, a sewer rat finds his way from up the pints into the house. Roddy, who finds this rat Sid very dirty and rude, decides to flush him down the loo. Unfortunately for Roddy, Sid flushes him down first and Roddy ends up in the adventure of a lifetime...I recommend this to people who like Aardman, Dreamworks and funny films. Enjoy ""Flushed Away""! P.S You have to at least bear seeing slugs to watch this film, as throughout singing slugs appear."
105,Flushed Away,5,31 May 2008,"Too Fast, Not Enough Detail","Short and pacey, Flushed Away doesn't have time to set up its characters or plot in enough detail, making it feel empty.The moral is obviously that being lonely is bad and lots of friends and family is good, however, especially with Aardman's Wallace & Gromit The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit in mind, it comes across as being rich and posh is bad and common as muck is good, and frankly, this is quite offensive.Roddy is a pet mouse from Kensington who is flushed down the toilet when a nasty sewer mouse, Sid, breaks into his home. Roddy quickly gets embroiled with a villain plot that doesn't really matter and meets sewer mouse Rita who has a huge family. What is not set up is Roddy's relationship with Tabitha, the little girl who looks after him. This vital element of what a pet's life if like being missing makes Roddy's desire to be like Rita seem like a fad. The audience never sees Roddy's life, so cannot know why he should want to change it. Instead the audience is only given a view of pets from the sewer mice, who know nothing of this life and can't judge. There is also an annoying omission in that at the start Tabitha leaves Roddy too much food while she goes on holiday and at the end he has been replaced by fat Sid. The assumption is that Tabitha will think this is an overfed Roddy, but it is never mentioned, so instead the audience is left to believe that Tabitha simply doesn't notice that her pet has turned into an entirely different creature. Perhaps the makers of the film have never had a pet, and do not understand the close bond that can form. Perhaps they are too busy hating posh people.Aardman's plasticine-animation style doesn't sit quite right with Dreamworks' lazy computer animation, and Roddy's permanent grin and lack of resemblance to a mouse is slightly annoying, whereas had this been stop-motion it would be endearing and impressive.Flushed Away is filled with little jokes, details and references that are very hit and miss, so it is down to the individual whether they spend it cracked up with hysterical laughter, or stony faced. This one is very much down to personal taste, but it does need to be longer and more developed."
106,Flushed Away,5,29 April 2008,Overly reliant on slapstick,"Although I enjoy Wallace and Gromit and their quirky style of humor, I found Flushed Away disappointingly dull and overbrimming with slapstick humor.The film moves along too quickly, with very little character or plot development. The writing doesn't adhere tightly and neatly to a theme, compared to many Pixar movies.A lot of screen time is devoted to visual gimmicks and slapstick stunts. I got the impression that the movie is aimed at young kids. It has funny moments but I found myself frequently bored. Like other Dreamworks animated movies, Flushed Away capitalizes on references to current pop culture; these references are enjoyable for the moment but will contribute to the movie aging very poorly. The slugs are fun and cute, but the movie overuses them and they grow stale as well.All in all, I found Flushed Away to be below average compared to other modern animated comedies."
107,Flushed Away,8,18 September 2007,What a 'Slug-Fest'!,"I haven't laughed so much in years! There is just so much fun to be had that more than one viewing is required - every scene has some Aardman magic: some of it so fast that it's easy to miss a delightful nuance...The 'choice of voice', from Jean Reno to Bill Nighy to Miriam Margolyes to EVERYONE is inspired.The detailed backgrounds are 'to die for'. And the story/plot line ably supports deranged villains, Heath Robinson-esquire contraptions and a suitably fraught romance. I can't discuss things in any more detail since almost ANY in-depth remarks would inadvertently supply spoilers.I'm about to rush out and buy the DVD - yes, it's THAT good!"
108,Flushed Away,6,11 July 2007,Lacks the freshness and genuine imagination that made Wallace and Gromit a success,"Coming right off of an Academy Award winning movie is a hard task for almost everyone, even animators working on the movie years in advance. With the striking popularity of Wallace and Gromit and the Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Aardman Studios tried a little something different with their follow-up, Flushed Away. And while the end result is not all too bad, it seems to be missing that spark that made the man and dog team such a great idea to start.Flushed Away revolves around a spoiled rat, Roddy (Hugh Jackman). He lives a pretty lavish lifestyle within the apartment of his owners, and does not seem to want to part from it. By chance, another rat, Sid (Shane Richie), invades the home, and ends up sending Roddy down the toilet and into the sewer. Once down there, Roddy discovers a whole other world of rats he knew nothing about. Soon after, he meets up with Rita (Kate Winslet), who is on the run from the crimeboss The Toad (Ian McKellan), who just may have some evilly big plans for the small city of rats.While the Wallace and Gromit film felt fresh and brazingly original in a time of CGI-animation, Flushed Away feels like a lot more like a bit of the same and less of the different. Other than the fact that it is about rats (which is not too much different now, for one of the biggest animated films at this moment is about a rat), the film really does not have much to offer filmgoers by way of interesting and must-see animation.It tries in a lot of cases to really make something of itself, but very rarely does it do anything worth more than a few chuckles. I laughed a few times, but the rest of the time, I just sat waiting to be amazed. I never managed to get that feeling. It just seems like the filmmakers spent all their energy creating Wallace and Gromit, and just decided to not even really try with this one. All of the painstaking and little details in the former film are completely missing here. Yes, there are some minor details and a few blink-and-you-will-miss-them nods to Wallace and Gromit, but it just feels weak and totally unambitious in its scope when compared together.The other thing that does not help is the fact that the story is dull and uninspired. Yes, it has that interesting touch of the crime syndicate (which seems like a bit much for a child to understand, but at least it did not get totally Scorsese-esquire), but at its core, the film tells an old story that has been told over a million times by now, and does not need to be direly redone over again. After the initial drop-in into the rat city and the first encounter with The Toad, the film just jogs around where it wants to go, and almost becomes totally unwatchable. I lost almost all intention of continuing, even despite the fact that there would be less than an hour left to watch (as these first moments happen within the first twenty to thirty minutes of the film).The performances leave a lot to be desired too. Jackman is not too bad as Roddy, and neither is Winslet as Rita. Jackman breathes life into his character, and makes him a believable case. Winslet on the other hand, allows some genuine spunk to enter into her character, and gives Rita the bad-ass attitude she deserves, and needs in a film like this (especially with how straight-laced Jackman is for the majority of the film). I think they both could have done with a bit more enthusiasm on all counts. McKellan does much better than both, and tears up the screen in his role as The Toad. He may have very few lines, but the little amount he does have leave an undeniable impression on the viewer. He knows just how to work his voice to make the character seem both like an alright guy, as well as someone who is genuinely evil.I really liked Bill Nighy and Andy Serkis in their roles as The Toad's hit men and hunchmen. Both play off of each other very well, and have clearly perfected their voices for their roles here. They speak with such finesse and clarity that one should wonder whether these guys are actually talking rats in real life.Jean Reno unfortunately, seems to suffer from the same lack of enthusiasm plaguing Jackman, only to a much worse degree. While Jackman and Winslet look like they are at least making an attempt at their lines, Reno seems to be blasting right through them, ending quicker than you can read he film's title. Disappointing to say the least, as I usually really like Reno's work.The animation is a mixed bag. A lot of it works beautifully and looks quite majestic on screen. But this only works when the claymation and the CGI are working together to give such wonderful images. The rest of the time, the CG and the claymation do not match up, leaving a lot of moments looking rather messy and horribly edited. I know that they probably needed to move each individual piece like they did on Wallace and Gromit for some of these scenes, but they could have at least continued to pretend the CG was helping to do it. Thankfully, it only happens in a few scenes, mostly shadowed unless you are directly looking for it.All in all, Flushed Away is alright, but it lacks the zest and genuine imagination of Wallace and Gromit, and many other recent CG-animated films. It is worth the watch (especially to see the references), but do not expect anything more than watchability to come from it.6/10."
109,Flushed Away,7,16 June 2007,"Getting ""Flushed"" Is A Lot of Fun!","The British animation company Aardman that revived stop-motion, clay-animation film-making with astonishing success in both ""Chicken Run"" (2000) and ""Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" (2005) has produced a new, cleverly inventive, animated comedy sure to amuse adolescents without alienating adults. Unlike ""Chicken Run"" and the ""Wallace & Gromit"" misadventures, Aardman's latest feature ""Flushed Away"" shuns the old-fashioned, time-consuming clay-animation process and for the first time uses computer-generated images that flawlessly replicate their signature style. Reportedly, the filmmakers wound up using CGI imagery because it is virtually impossible to render water in Claymation. Although this talking animal's opus doesn't top ""Chicken Run,"" it does surpass the last ""Wallace & Gromit"" feature. This exhilarating epic about a pampered pet rat who gets uprooted from his life of self-centered domesticity and literally finds himself flushed down a toilet into the grimy London sewer system never runs out of either energy or laughs during its brisk 86-minute running time. The crisp, colorful, near three-dimensional imagery has never looked sharper and the voice casting of first-rate talent, such as ""X-Men's"" Hugh Jackson, ""Titanic's"" Kate Winslet, and ""Lord of the Rings'"" Ian McKellan, complements an impressive array of expressively etched animated characters. Rated PG for mild profanity as well as the inevitable but definitely non-offensive potty humor, ""Flushed Away"" deserves to be seen several times to appreciate its wealth of detail.Roddy St. James (voice of Hugh Jackson) lives in the lap of London luxury as a little girl's pet rodent. When the family takes a vacation, mischievous Roddy has the run of the house in what roughly resembles a synthesis of ""Home Alone"" and ""Toy Story."" He collects the little girl's dolls, loads them into a red, battery-powered convertible sports car, and careens recklessly around the premises. Everything turns upside down for Roddy when an overweight intruder¬óSid, a sewer rat soccer fan (British TV actor Shane Richie), blunders into Roddy's paradise and refuses to leave. Roddy has no use for anybody as uncouth as Sid and plans to evict the fat, blue-collared rat.. Sly Sid turns the tables on Roddy, however, unceremoniously flushing our hapless protagonist down the commode into another subterranean wilderness where he meets an independent rodent chick called Rita (voice of Kate Winslet) who owns her own power boat. Roddy persuades Rita to help him get back to his comfortable home in Kensington. Unfortunately, Roddy learns that getting home is easier said than done. Rita and he run afoul of the villainous likes of Toad (voice of Ian McKellan) and his army of despicable trench-coated frog henchmen led by Le Frog (voice of Jean Reno of ""The Professional""). Megalomaniacal Toad has concocted a dastardly scheme to destroy all the rats in the sewer and then repopulate it with his own froggy offspring. The evil Toad takes advantage of the upcoming World Cup soccer finals to achieve his inglorious deed. During half-time, Toad knows that sports fans will rush to their toilets to evacuate their bladders and bowels, and Toad wants to open the floodgates that protect the vast underground wasteland and flush away the underground. The only thing standing between Toad and the success of his mission is Rita. Apparently, it seems that she has stolen the means to control the floodgate mechanism and wears it as a belt around her sexy hips.In their cinematic debut, co-directors David Bowers and Sam Hill never let the pace lag in this hilarious breath of fresh air. The lightweight but engaging script by scenarists Dick Clement & Ian La Frenais, ""Frasier"" scribes Chris Lloyd & Joe Keenan and Will Davies of ""Johnny English"" thrives on sophisticated sight-gags, catchy dialogue, and occasional parodies of blockbuster Hollywood movies. Beneath all of this droll nonsense lurks a socially redeeming message: friends and family take precedence over material possessions. Initially, Roddy learns this moral lesson with considerable reluctance. Meanwhile, the writers have contrived several exciting, hair-raising, cliffhanger set-pieces to maintain interest. At intervals, Bowers and Hill bring on groups of ping-pong ball-eyed slugs that serenade the leads with chart-breaking tunes from the 1960s. Although the movie makers rely on slick, seamless CGI-animation in place of Claymation, ""Flushed Away"" narrows misses the heights of ""Chicken Run."""
110,Flushed Away,6,7 June 2007,"An odd, cute, and fun film for a rainy day","OK...er...bear with me people.I never planned on seeing this movie. I hate these overdone CGI animal adventure movies. Doogal. Barnyard. Over the flippin' hedge. Happy Feet (though that one was OK). Besides crappy romantic comedies, they're the most overdone film genre of all-time.But, as it so happens, I found myself on a bus to Six Flags in Massachusetts one day as part of a college reunion my dad was in (there was a program for the kids, and our group, age 15-17, was going to Six Flags one day), and they were showing this film, ""Flushed Away,"" on the bus.Meh. I had nothing better to do. Sleep? I just woke up like a minute and a half ago, it was 9:00 in the morning. Study for my exam I was taking off-campus on Saturday? Yeah, right. Watch ""Flushed Away"" for no apparent reason whatsoever? Sounds like a plan! OK, so basically, ""Flushed Away"" is about this lonely (but almost scarily elated) rat named Roddy who gets flushed down the loo one day and discovers a huge underworld city in the sewers of London where other rats live. He meets this girl scavenger rat named Rita who looks for treasures in the sewers and he keeps ruining things for her on her boat...thus Rita gets a huge sense of resentment for this poor rat. Roddy needs to get back to Kensington (hehe, I love that place) where he lives...but has no plan of doing so. Rita just so happens to have a dilemma as well: she has this quarrel with a big toad named...er...the Toad who stole a ruby from her that was going to make her poor family wealthy again. Roddy agrees to help Rita get the ruby back in return for her help in getting him back to the land ""up top."" (Kensington) As you can see from my basic plot summary, ""Flushed Away"" is an odd film. It has some fantastic voice talent, though, starring Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellen, and Bill Nighy. It also is pretty funny with tons of British humour (oh, did I mention the evil Toad is trying to rig all the toilets in London to suck the people in during the half-time break at the World Cup? hehe ) and it reminded me immensely of Nick Park's brilliant ""Wallace and Grommit"" series. There are references to tons of other adult movies that only we would get. The soundtrack is fantastic as well with some very good tunes, including a track by The Dandy Warhols.Overall--funny, entertaining, and enjoyable, but probably not worth seeing again. It kind of struck me as one of the kids' animated films that didn't exactly work for me, and (most of them) usually do. OK for casual viewing...I wouldn't get it on DVD or spend too much money tracking it down."
111,Flushed Away,10,24 May 2007,Terrible Title/Wonderful Movie,"This is such a great movie!!! It's just a shame that it was titled the way it was, because I'm sure it will dissuade people from seeing it. I know when I saw the previews it looked very cute but the title was so...crude! I'm sure parents pass it by thinking it's all crude toilet humor (when the toilet only plays a small part in the story) but other than that, it has really witty dialog for adults and a message for the kiddies. It's one of those movies that is on several levels and is enjoyable no matter what your age. Loved the slugs especially and the mime frog! Hysterical!!! See this movie and bring the kids. Good Clean Fun"
112,Flushed Away,7,14 May 2007,Light Hearted Fun,"Roddy is a decidedly upper-crust ""society mouse"" who lives the life of a beloved pet in a posh Kensington flat. When a sewer rat named Sid comes spewing out of the sink and decides he's hit the jackpot, Roddy schemes to rid himself of the pest by luring him into the ""whirlpool."" Sid may be an ignorant slob, but he's no fool, so it is Roddy who winds up being flushed away into the bustling sewer world of Ratropolis.There Roddy meets Rita, an enterprising scavenger who works the sewers in her faithful boat, the Jammy Dodger. Roddy immediately wants out, or rather, up; Rita wants to be paid for her trouble; and, speaking of trouble, the villainous Toad--who royally despises all rodents equally, making no distinction between mice and rats--wants them iced... literally. The Toad dispatches his two hapless hench-rats, Spike and Whitey, to get the job done. When they fail, the Toad has no choice but to send to France for his cousin--that dreaded mercenary, Le Frog.Out of the ""Animation Week"" I am having, I thought I would have the funnest with this film. Well, it fell below my expectations but it's still an entertaining film. One thing I liked were the cultural references. I mean, there are tons of easter eggs you could look for!I also found one joke in this film similar to the one from Open Season: The constant and continuous appearances of the snails, which is still funny, but since I've seen Open Season first, it wasn't as much fun. The animation in this film looks good and the action sequences in the film was great.You could feat your eyes on the look of the film while you can enjoy the characters. This film is funny and adorable. Although it's one of those mediocre animation film, it's still a nice addition to the tons of animation flicks released in 2006.If you want your children to see another animation flick, they'll like this one, although you can KINDA enjoy it yourself. You might like the film because of the cultural references. It's an enjoyable film."
113,Flushed Away,,4 May 2007,Exciting and action packed adventure,"This film is about a pet rat's adventures after being flushed down the toilet. He befriends another rat from literally another world, and saves the world from evil amphibians.I really liked this film. It approaches the world from a kid's view; the toilet as the jacuzzi is something I would not have come up with! The plot is warm and has a human touch to it. The characters are likable and cute, and the inverted T shaped head of them is a distinct resemblance to the ""Wallace and Gromit"" series. The animation is smooth, and the scenes are always so colourful and rich. There is something to keep one's attention all the time. This film is a fun and warm film for anyone."
114,Flushed Away,7,7 April 2007,Really enjoyable movie!,"My 12 year old son & I saw this in the cinema and we thoroughly enjoyed it. My wife hadn't seen it so we rented it tonight for her...and we enjoyed it just as much, if not more. It's a really great storyline, albeit a little predictable, and the voice talent in this film is fantastic. Bill Nighy, in particular, is excellent as Whitey. I enjoyed this more than HAPPY FEET, which seemed to take itself a little too seriously. It's got a requisite amount of toilet humour (both literal and figurative) so the young boys will love it. But see it for the voice talent and the brilliant animation. Of course, WALLACE is also a favourite of ours! Really enjoyable film."
115,Flushed Away,7,7 April 2007,All In Good Merry Fun (SPOILERS),"SPOILERSFlushed Away is probably my favorite computer animated film of 2006. I have not seen Over the Hedge or Open Season or Cars yet so I have not seen a lot of computer animated films made in 2006, but this is my favorite that I have seen. This movie is hilarious, and I have not seen so many movie parodies and references since the first Shrek, which was six years ago. I mean, a spotted a couple of James Bond parodies, Finding Nemo, Inspector Gadget, Terminator Two, and X-Men. I really like the X-Men parody being as Hugh Jackman played Wolverine in X-Men and he plays Roddy in this.Here's the plot. A pampered rat named Roddy is flushed away into an underground city in the sewers. He meets Rita, a spunky rat that stole a jewel from a crime lord toad named Toad for her poor family. He is after her for that. Roddy discovers that the jewel is fake and breaks it. He promises her some of his family's jewels if she helps him get back home. The only problem is that the Toad is after her again. This time he wants a cable she stole. He summons Le Frog, a hit-man frog of some sort. Rita and Roddy get back into Roddy's home. She discovers that he is a pet. He gives her the jewelry. She leaves and Roddy then discovers that the Toad wants the cable to flood the underground city. Roddy goes back to the city. Toad gets the cable back. Rita and Roddy save the day by freezing the sewage water. Roddy decides to stay in the underground city.Overall, this is a great and fun computer animated film. It is not the greatest computer animated film but it is steal a great time to watch. There are a lot of memorable things in this movie. The singing slugs, for one thing. Also the French henchman-frogs-things. The computer animated effects of the water in this are amazing and stunning to look at. Everything else looks like clay. Just kidding, everything is beautiful. I could not believe the cast. Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Bill Nighy, and Ian McKellen are some of the more familiar faces. Anyway, this is a great computer animated family to watch.7/10Recommended Films: Shrek."
116,Flushed Away,7,29 March 2007,A pleasant surprise,"Surprisingly good mix of action-packed slapstick and sharp-witted humour. I was somewhat less-than-enthralled with the trailer, which made this look like a toilet humour-heavy kid's flick, but the actual product was pretty funny, with lots of clever nods to other films and tons of dry British humour. The story was a nice twist on the old clich√©, and the voice acting was pretty good all around. Bill Nighy's Whitey and Jean Reno's Le Frog were both hilarious, and everyone else was solid - save for Ian McKellan, who really went over-the-top in his evilness. The music was pretty effective, and the little asides with the slugs were another nice touch. Really a pleasant surprise."
117,Flushed Away,6,14 March 2007,It's about rats! In a sewer!,"There is one inescapable problem with FLUSHED AWAY: No matter how you look at it, in the end, you are expected to root for a sewer full of rats to not only survive, but to prosper. Yes, they are animated rats. And they are cute and are dressed in cute clothes and do cute human-like things. But they are rats in a sewer! Rats! In a sewer! Somehow the cute factor just isn't going to work here -- because they are rats ... in a sewer.Admittedly, I have always found it a bit difficult to believe we are suppose to think of mice as lovable (sorry Mickey!), but we have come to accept that. Cartoon animals are a staple, like bunnies and ducks and dogs and cats and, yes, even mice. And over the years a wide menagerie of less-than-lovable animals, from coyotes to skunks to Tasmanian devils, have tickled our funnybone if not warmed our hearts. And in the past few years we have gotten films that try to tell us that ants and sharks and even big hairy monsters are just like people too. And I freely admit that I am fond of Pinky and The Brain, who are rats, but rats in a lab. But the characters in FLUSHED AWAY are rats in a sewer. A sewer full of rats! I wonder how the makers of the film sold it to the studio. Did they tell the head honchos that the film was a metaphor for life?: ""It's about a sewer full of rats: Just like man in his world! We are all just rats in a giant sewer. Get it? What a valuable lesson to teach the kiddies. And there is nothing more lovable to a child than a rat. Especially one in a sewer!"" FLUSHED AWAY is from Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation, the people who gave us Wallace and Gromit, so if anyone can make the subject matter work it would seem to be them. But this is Aardman's first crack at computer animation and it lacks the whimsy that mark their stop-motion animation. Though brightly drawn and detailed, that is all lost in a story that is told in a desperate hurry. Details that should bring out the film's sense of humor fly by too fast to appreciate or even comprehend. Instead of flushed away, any hint of charm or playfulness is rushed away by a seeming need to tell the story at a frenetic pace. And the trite and uninspired choice of pop songs jammed into the story is just an annoying nuisance.But, more than all that, it is a film about rats, rats in the sewer. One wonders what they will come up with next -- a cartoon about cute and lovable bacteria living in the lower intestinal tract? They could call it ... no, I'm not going there."
118,Flushed Away,7,19 January 2007,I totally thought that I was watching a G film,i saw this movie on it's November release and I certainly did not like it very much. Though after I watched it I found out that it was PG and I totally thought it should be G. first of all it has no scary humor what so ever and there was no bad humor. It is true that Roddy was flushed down the toilet but that didn't seem to have much of a PG sense. after all the Wallace and Gromit movie and cartoons were absolutely great and so was CHICKEN RUN. and I liked both those movies and I liked the short film's to.but of all the Aardman movies both short's and movies this was my least favorite.This is a geek thing I thought that my parent's thought.They loved it which i don't think they should. I'm sorry if this would hurt there feeling's I just don't think they should is all.Still the idea of a rat being flushed down the toilet didn't seem much of a good idea when I heard more about it.If you don't like potty humor I suggest that you don't see this movie. Though I still totally think that this movie should be G instead of PG because it definitely does not have much bad humor in it.
119,Flushed Away,6,29 December 2006,Slugly!,"This family friendly yarn covers the adventures of a spoilt pet who ends up seeing the other side of life, i.e. in the sewer. It's basically another tale of Town Mouse meets Country Mouse with a few added characters and plot twists. On the whole a fairly predictable story which was a little disappointing when one has such high expectations of Aardman (I'm a huge fan of Wallace and Gromit) and of the Shrek movies.The characters who kept the whole thing together for me were the slugs. Their vocal stylings were superbly apt and hilarious.On the whole, it was reasonably entertaining and my kids enjoyed it a lot."

121,Flushed Away,4,19 November 2006,Disatrous Dreamworks,"OK maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie. Its about this pampered rat, who lives in a palace. Then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet! He ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants. He will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats.He plans to take the gem and to flood rat city! THe cool part about this movie is the slugs. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make noises, its awesome, its also pretty funny. OK bottom line, it is aimed at 7 year olds. Other wise, a great movie to take a younger family member to see. I didn't think the animation was real dreamworks art though, more like WAllace and Gromit. i thinkthey slacked a little on that. The movie was just decent, not worth spending $9.50 for though, sorry."
122,Flushed Away,,17 November 2006,Good Movie if you can look past the toiler humor,"I went into the screening of Flushed Away admittedly rather reluctant because I knew that the studio moved away from stop motion animation (or claymation) and decided to use cg animation for this film. Being a huge Wallace and Gromit and Creature Comforts fan, I was prepared for the worst. Throw in some bad buzz, some negative reviews and virtually no profit, and I was not very enthusiastic about this film. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised, as the movie is quite entertaining! First and foremost, I must get this out of the way. The premise of the movie, pardon the pun, stinks! I had a hard time with the whole being flushed down the sewer, and a whole plot surrounding sewer rats and frogs. However, once you get past that, the movie moves along at a rapid pace and is very enjoyable.The story is predictable, as animated films tend to be (is there an American animated movie that isn't formulaic?). A well-to-do mouse, Roddy ¬ñ voiced by Hugh Jackman, and who really resembles him I might add- who happens to be a pet to a wealthy family in England, gets flushed down into the sewers. There he learns all about the rats and frogs, and singing slugs that tend to follow him around in perfect verse. All poor Roddy wants to do is make it back ""up top"" where he came from, but a series of unfortunate events gets him caught up with a mysterious thief (or is it hero?) Rita. His involvement with her sweeps him into a huge mafia-like player in the underworld, the fabulous The Toad- voiced by Ian McKellan ¬ñ and his band of French frog thugs. Suddenly Roddy is a player in a huge ploy that he must untangle! And what about the animation? Well it's in typical Aardman fashion- eyes close together, funny mouths, British humor, skinny exaggerated character designs, brilliant colors, and for that matter brilliant villains. The villains are really the highlight of the film (well besides the singing slugs who steal every scene they are in). The character design and the voice talent and the execution of the villains is just flawless. Every single one of them is good in their own right. Its as if the animators had way too much fun with the villains ¬ñ and who wouldn't? I happen to love a good villain, and was extremely impressed with the ones in Flushed Away.Overall, Flushed Away is an pretty decent film. The storyline is excellent (the most important part) and keeps you entertained the whole time, and the visuals are stunning, and the villains are perfect. I am sad that the movie didn't have good buzz going in, because the film would have done better I think. I'm afraid it's an unfortunate victim of the over-saturated cg animated movie marketplace, and audiences are simply tired of seeing the same type of movie over and over again. The predictable storyline couldn't have helped either.:::www.animationchick.com:::"
123,Flushed Away,6,5 November 2006,Triumph of Quantity over Quality,"Essentially I would recommend this movie. However I wish I'd looked here on IMDb for the credits before I'd gone. I would have known not to expect the trademark subtlety or charm associated either to Aardman or Pixar films.This movie basically comes across as a 2nd-rate script which has had some kind of cosmetic overhaul at the hands of Aardman and Pixar.It works as something designed for a younger set that the average Pixar or Aardman film - both of which generally succeed at pleasing a wide range of tastes and ages.Both Aardman and Pixar pacing has always been quick - but not too quick. The characters from both of these pedigrees have been vividly drawn and very individual.The pacing here is breakneck, and all characters (central and peripheral) are drawn incredibly broadly in a way which truly mars the audience's emotional involvement. The film is a series of rapid-fire sight-gags. Everything happens very improbably conveniently.One character given a guitar happens to play well. Other characters which happen to be around pick up the harmonies of his improvised song. The logic of the world being painted is like that in a TV variety skit show such as Sonny & Cher. If these surreal moments are sprinkled judiciously (think the musical number around the campfire in ""Three Amigos""), they can be funny and endearing. A full two hours of this leaves you a bit numb, however. When every character is a bullet-proof Bugs Bunny, there isn't even the low level of suspense required for this kind of film. When every character happens to arrive where the dizzying plot flow requires him to be for a cheap gag to unfold, there isn't even the light platform of fictional reality to focus on."
