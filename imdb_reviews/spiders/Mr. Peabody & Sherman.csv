0,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,3 March 2014,Dreamworks' latest animation about a time-travelling dog and his adopted son - how could you resist?,"So I went to see this with not much expectation at all, the one trailer I had seen didn't really grab me but I decided to see it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. Mr. Peabody is this extremely intelligent dog who can talk and his adopted son Sherman is a 7-year-old boy who is a sponge for facts but quite slow practically. They go on adventures through time to learn about history. The movie sets that up in the first 15 minutes, which by the way it was done it looked like the movie was going to be some kids documentary about history but when it actually got into the story it was really fun. The comedy made me laugh, the visuals are stunning, I wish I could've seen it in 3D, the story is quite unique but also had similar elements of other movies, I got a Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure vibe and you get some pretty generic characters that you've seen in quite a lot of animated movies but the plot was't boring; I was interested to the end. The voice acting is pretty average but the way Mr. Peabody says things do add a certain something to the film. 8 out of 10."
1,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,5 March 2014,Barking mad... in a good way.,"It's hard to imagine somebody trying to pitch the story for Mr. Peabody & Sherman - ""Let's make a movie about a genius dog who goes travelling in time and space with his adopted human son!"" Well, actually, someone did make that pitch... way back in the 1950s. The two characters first appeared in Rocky And His Friends, an animated television show that will ring a bell with American audiences. But those of us who are less familiar with these characters needn't fret: this new incarnation by DreamWorks Animation is bright, funny and packed with great gags, a pleasingly smart treat for kids and adults alike.Mr. Peabody (voiced by Ty Burrell) is the brainiest dog in all the land, and a celebrated inventor, athlete and businessman to boot. From his lonely perch atop the world, he decides to adopt a baby boy. Everything goes well until the bespectacled Sherman (Max Charles) starts school. Forced to play nice with Penny (Ariel Winter), a classmate who ridicules him for having a dog as a father, Sherman shows her the WABAC: a time machine invented by Mr. Peabody to allow his son to bear witness to history in the making. Together, Sherman and Penny embark on a trip across time that could destroy the past, the present and the future.Bouncing merrily from the French Revolution to ancient Greece by way of the Italian Renaissance, Mr. Peabody & Sherman messes mischievously with history - we're presented with a cake-obsessed Marie Antoinette (Lauri Fraser), a volatile Mona Lisa (Lake Bell) and a beef-headed Agamemnon (Patrick Warburton). Most of these references will likely be lost on younger viewers, but there's still plenty to keep them entertained. As the film races along in its madcap way, gags and puns (so bad they're brilliant) are tossed at the audience in such great amounts that it's rather amazing that most of them work as well as they do.The film does suffer a little from its breakneck pace, as it rushes headlong towards a cataclysmic convergence of the past and the present. The story gets a little lost in the shuffle of history, with almost too much to absorb by the time nefarious social services worker Ms. Grunion (voiced with wicked relish by Allison Janney) turns up - a canine bigot to the core - and threatens to remove Sherman from Mr. Peabody's custody.Nevertheless, director Rob Minkoff manages to pull the whole thing off, balancing the film's largely irreverent tone with a surprisingly heartfelt ending. He even crafts a father-son moment near the end of the film that's both shamelessly sweet and a cheeky nod to cinematic history. (Think Kirk Douglas and Stanley Kubrick circa 1960.) It's all quite enough to suggest that there's a bright cinematic future ahead for this little boy and his dog/dad."
2,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,8 March 2014,Mr. Peabody & Sherman is a nice update on the classic TV cartoon series,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. It's based on ""Peabody's Improbable History"", a cartoon that always aired in the middle of the ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" show and had Mr. Peabody, a smart dog with glasses, and Sherman, his adopted human son-also with glasses, going to various important events in history ending with some kind of pun often said by Peabody to a bemused Sherman. This version takes some elements from the pilot episode (Peabody adopts Sherman amid some troubles) and also adds somewhat of a girlfriend from school for the boy. With that out of the way, I'll just say that I found some amusement at much of the humor concerning some historical figures and some modern lingo and I did laugh out loud a few times. There's even some heart rending scenes I liked. But nothing beats the charm of the old cartoons even though they weren't the best artistically in animation. Still, the computer-animation is visually pleasing so on that note, I recommend Mr. Peabody & Sherman."
3,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,7 March 2014,Worth Your Time,"After the February smash hit: ""The Lego Movie,"" ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" certainly does have a tough act to follow. Despite this, ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" certainly does bring another high-quality piece of family entertainment to the big screen.Surprisingly, the film's story is quite strong. Based on the retro cartoon of the same name, ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" centers on a highly intelligent dog named Mr. Peabody (excellently voiced by Modern Family star, Ty Burrell) who adopts a young boy named Sherman (also excellently voiced by 8-year-old Max Charles). Peabody takes Sherman on adventures through time with his super advanced time machine known as the ""Way Back"". After a series of incidents, the duo must travel to different time periods and eventually have to fix a potential hole in the space time continuum. Many recent films based on retro cartoons (such as the abysmal ""Scooby Doo"" and ""Smurfs"" films) have failed to provide a good screenplay to accompany its animated hijinks. This film, however, is packed with witty dialogue and good morals about unconventional families, fatherhood, and childhood struggles. Mr. Peabody and Sherman are surprisingly deep characters. The fact that Sherman has been raised by a dog does eventually cause a rift between the two. In the beginning of the movie, Sherman is teased at school and called a ""dog"" because his father is one. Also faced with his own maturing, Sherman wishes to do more things on his own. Peabody, meanwhile is apprehensive of Sherman doing things on his own, as he fears inside that Sherman will outgrow him. This is quite a lot of conflict for a ""kid's movie.""Luckily, the thematic elements are interspersed with charming humor and exciting visuals. Each time period is filled with beautifully animated landscapes and enjoyable characters with top-notch vocal performances. In 18th century France, Marie Antoinette (voiced by Lauri Fraser) is portrayed as a bubbly, naive, cake-obsessed aristocrat who is constantly stuffing her face with dessert. In ancient Egypt, palm trees, pyramids and towering statues show a clear rose gallery of effort from the animation team.It's also worth pointing out that this film has some of the finest voice acting I have ever heard in an animated feature. Ty Burrell and Max Charles bring believable emotion and jocularity to Peabody and Sherman respectively. Burrell gives Peabody a suitably intellectual and clear sounding voice, giving an extra jolt of likability to the character. Max Charles shows an excessive amount of talent for an 8- year-old (probably younger when the dialogue was recorded), making Sherman a believable young boy with a roller-coaster of emotions throughout. An all-star supporting cast including Steve Colbert, Ariel Winter, Stanley Tucci, Patrick Warburton, Dennis Haysbert, Allison Janney, Leslie Mann and even Mel Brooks are certainly a treasure to listen to as well.In regards to its historical accuracy, though this film does certainly have its share of jarring anachronisms (such as heart-printed underwear and an actual working flying machine made by Leonardo da Vinci), there is certainly a decent amount of informative elements in the historical scenes. Kids may actually be delighted to learn about how Marie Antoinette helped ignite the French Revolution and how George Washington didn't really cut down a cherry tree. The film makes the wise decision of being a colorful family adventure film while still having some informative elements. LA Times' film critic Betsey Sharkey recently criticized this movie for being ""too smart for its own good,"" saying: ""Mr. Peabody's ""teaching moments"" will sail right over the heads of kids while requiring adults to pay attention."" With all due respect, Ms. Sharkey, I feel like the ""teaching moments"" are what make this movie stand out from other family fare. The fact that the filmmakers bring some education to the screenplay really shows that they have faith in a kid's ability to watch a movie.In all fairness, one common criticism I do somewhat understand is the film's somewhat convoluted second act. Without giving anything away, I do have to admit things get pretty hectic. However, after many years of watching movies with time travel, I've learned to put down my complaint notebook and enjoy the movie. Let's face it: it's pretty much a guarantee that a movie involving time travel will have at least a couple of plot holes. Even excellent time travel films like ""Looper"" and ""Back to the Future"" have plot holes. However, those discussions are for another day.At the end of the day, ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" is a beautiful, funny, and even heartfelt film that families from every background will get a kick out of. It is enjoyable to watch, and I dare even say it's one of Dreamworks' best efforts to date."
4,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,5 March 2014,I did not see that coming!,"I wasn't impressed watching the trailer. Thankfully, I got a chance of a pre-screening. I'm perplexed by the low ratings because I absolutely loved this movie! This is coming from someone who hasn't seen Mr. Peabody before.Mr. Peabody is a genius dog who adopts a boy and raises him to be a genius too. Unfortunately things change when the boy goes to school and gets bullied by a girl. Mr. Peabody, to appease things, invites the girl and her parents to a dinner at their house, everything goes haywire from there and we meet some pretty interesting characters from the past.What made this movie special is the little details that are revealed along the way like how Sherman was adopted. The animation is fantastic and the 3D adorns it. As someone who likes puns, I absolutely loved the jokes, not just from Mr. Peabody but from other characters in the movie as well. Agamemnon was hilarious! Not everything is funny though, there are a few serious and tear jerking moments that make this movie special.My only complaint is that some time travel stuff explained in the movie can be a bit hard to understand for children. Other than that, it's an absolute treat both for children and adults. Go watch it!"
5,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,1 March 2014,An entertaining movie for kids as well as adults.,"Mr. Peabody & Sherman is the story of an extremely intelligent dog named, Mr. Peabody(Ty Burrell) & his adopted human son, Sherman(Max Charles). Using a time traveling machine called, the WABAC, the duo travel to the past to experience iconic historic moments & meet historic people firsthand. However, after Sherman gets into trouble at school due to Penny Peterson(Ariel Winter), Peabody decides to invite Penny & her parents, Paul(Stephen Colbert) & Patty Peterson(Leslie Mann) for dinner to resolve the issue. However, the intelligent dog's plan horribly backfires when Sherman tells Penny about the WABAC & she being the obnoxious & inquisitive girl that she is, decides to do some time traveling of her own. Now, it's up to Mr. Peabody & Sherman to save Penny & return the space-time continuum to normal before the Petersons realize their daughter's missing. I was laughing throughout the film & had a blast! I loved the fact that Mr. Peabody, who is a dog, is way more clever than the humans he interacts with. I loved the father-son relationship between Mr. Peabody & his human kid, Sherman. Though this scenario could never happen in a million years, the makers of the movie make their relationship believable & emotional at the same time. Mr. Peabody gets pretty emotional & sad seeing how fast Sherman is growing up. I loved the idea of time travel in an animated film, which kind of makes it a sci-fi film, as well! The voice acting is the highlight of the movie. Ty Burrell, best known for portraying Phil Dunphy on the hit sitcom, Modern Family, is equally hilarious, sarcastic, goofy & endearing as Mr. Peabody. Max Charles is adorable as the innocent little kid, Sherman. Ariel Winter, also known for playing Alex Dunphy on Modern Family, is outstanding as the obnoxious & curious, Penny Peterson. Allison Janney is spectacular as the main antagonist, Ms. Grunion. Stephen Colbert is impressive as Paul Peterson. Leslie Mann is amazing as Patty Peterson. The famous characters of historical importance are brilliant as well. Special mention should be made of, Stanley Tucci, Lake Bell & Patrick Warburton for their unforgettable voice overs of Leonardo da Vinci, Mona Lisa & Agamemnon respectively. I would like to sign off by saying, Mr. Peabody & Sherman is a must watch for everyone who enjoys a darn good movie."
6,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,7 February 2014,Barking up the right tree.,"Based on a 60's short 'Peabody's Improbable History', DreamWorks and director Rob Minkoff ('The Lion King') bring the original characters up- to-date in this wonderfully charming and colourful romp.The story tells of Mr. Peabody, a talking canine (voiced by Modern Family's Ty Burrell), and his adopted ""pet"" son Sherman. An incident on Sherman's first day of school leads to Peabody inviting Penny and her parents for dinner, hoping the kids will reconcile their differences and avoiding potential loss of custody over Sherman. In an attempt to impress Penny, however, Sherman accidentally reveals the WABAC - Peabody's time travelling machine and ends up rewriting history that will have dire consequences in the future if not set right.I hadn't seen the original cartoon until I saw the film, but I caught the introduction episode on YouTube after and there were several scenes/dialogue that's been re-used in the movie. Even though it holds no nostalgia for me, it's a great little touch.The vocal talent is also great. There's the aforementioned Burrell, but also some other well-known names including, but not limited to, Stanley Tucci, Patrick Warburton (Kronk from 'The Emperor's New Groove'), Mel Brooks and Stephen Toblowsky. Their indistinguishable voices really liven up their respectable characters. And, while, Robert Downey Jr. was originally cast as Peabody, Burrell does a commendable job here.After being less than impressed with prior DreamWorks entries 'The Croods' and, more recently, 'Turbo', I ended up enjoying this a lot more than I initially thought I would. The humour is very child-friendly and it's still a step down from what I like to call the ""old"" DreamWorks ('Shrek', etc.), but it is great family entertainment.The story is on the predictable side, but has a great message and will keep parents and older siblings entertained, while the zany energy and characters will keep the kids amused. They might even pick up a thing or two about history.7/10."
7,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,28 March 2014,Rich Storyline and a Great Update for This 60s Character,"I saw the trailers and I expected it to be more concentrated on time travel and not have much of a story line. Well there is. A fantastic one at that! ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" is a wonderful story about a dog who adopts a boy. The film also has lots of animated things to love - like history, comedy, romance, suspense and so much more. To make it even better  characters come to live thanks to the brilliant voice-over actors such as Ty Burrel and Max Charles.The film starts when a young puppy is growing up in different shelters. From a very early age he shows everyone how very special he is. He is intelligent, athletic and smooth. He wins many prizes, but his greatest adventure happens when he adopts a boy. Together they go through multiple adventures and troubles but able to stay together.I love so much about this film. The film itself is fantastic! I love how they take twenty five-minute shows that had old, colored 2-D animation and turn it into modern 3D animation with the use of modern technology. My favorite scene is when they show the story of how Mr. Peabody adopts Sherman. They show points throughout Sherman's little life of great moments, like his first step in 1709. Then it shows how he finds Sherman. That is definitely a sweet and loving part! This movie has a bit of violence in it, therefore I recommend it to ages 5-18. I also believe that adults who admired this cartoon kids, will love this new version of these beloved characters. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST Film Critic.

8,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,8 March 2014,Generally Amiable,"It's quite noticeable that Dreamworks Animation is trying to break visual grounds in their most recent movies, but Mr. Peabody and Sherman gives a little reminder on their original magic. The first half shows how charming the worlds they can bring even without shoving too much spectacles, the characters bursting out absurd personality that may sometimes be senseless yet terribly affable. But of course, it's an adventure traveling through historical events, but it kind of falls short on the concept and rather places those things into a bumpy ride with a dramatic center. Those things could have worked if it was more sincere, but the real enjoyment lies on the basics where you let the mockeries and the humor speak.There is a nice additional depth behind the quirky and interesting relationship of the two, it makes their reintroduction on screen feel a lot fresh. The growth of their connection kicks in the plot, and that is when it starts becoming a bit forced. It doesn't seem comfortable with heightening the material. Turning things big and emotional is more like a must for the film to have because apparently that is what most animation today usually strive for. None of it actually plummets things down, but the story is probably better off smaller. People should remember the studio is more than trippy visuals and celebrity voices, in the end it's the simple witty humor that provides the genuine color in their movies.The plot here should have focused more on the intersection between education and parody within the historical settings than building epic proportions in its little plot. The typical elements are still fun. Ty Burrell is dashing as Mr. Peabody even with the seriousness that embodies the character do too sparks a sense of heart. The entire cast delivers the comedy admirably and it really leaves the viewers hungry for more. The zany effects kind of interrupts most of that, but the animation is still great overall. The designs are wonderfully loyal to its cartoony essence which is one of the striking things to pay close attention to.Mr. Peabody and Sherman is completely fun when it doesn't try following the modern roots of the genre. It's a lot brilliant when it's just traveling time, meeting a caricatured version of a particular historical figure, stopping candles, and let the personalities of the characters develop on their own without being too didactic. The relationship of Peabody and Sherman is already compelling at the start, but they could have think of better choices to justify its center. There are still plenty of strong stuff worth seeing around, it just needs to be cleverer."
9,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,5 March 2014,Dreamworks scored!!,"What a great animation!! Really engaging and fun! Imagine taking elements from Back to the Future, make Doc Brown look similar to Brian Griffin and give the character some Brain, from Pink and the Brain, characteristics.I don't know the show it's based on or the characters from it, it's a 1959 animated show that had a short run, I'll check it eventually, so this is a reinterpretation from a probably obscure show from the past, but I dare to say that I really enjoyed and got myself hooked with those characters!I even dare to say that I think we should have one of these films every year! It was awesome! Kids learn and get curious about things, there are interesting morals, dads also can have fun with all the pop culture references, it's really a great animation! Go check this out and take your kids with you, you'll have fun beyond imagination!"
10,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,2,20 March 2014,Absolutely Horrendous,"Warning: This entire review can be considered ""spoiler"" material, but it may save you from wasting a night out. Mr. Peabody and Sherman, is, without question, the worst movie of the year and absolutely should not be seen by elementary school age children. The movie starts out simple enough...then the bully clichés hit: Sherman is bullied by a girl; Peabody is bullied by a social worker. A social worker makes arbitrary and bigoted decisions based on a bully persona. And the family of the offending girl (the one who bullied Sherman in the beginning): White Yuppee Dad is definitely the boss with little wifey cow-towing to his ""my little angel can't do anything wrong"" attitude, regardless of her alleged opinions and peace-making efforts.In terms of how this ""film"" relates to the original Sherman & Peabody, as part of the Rocky & Bullwinkle Show: It doesn't. The original show had the two principals going back in time to a famous place or event. Sherman usually got into trouble and Peabody saved the day. Very innocent and known to us kids of the time to be a farce...like the accompanying ""Fractured Fairy Tales."" The Peabody in this film is a narcissistic megalomaniac; nothing like the character should have been. Very sad to see. Oh, and while I am at it...for any ""Family Guy"" fans familiar with the Griffin's neighbor ""Joe"" the cop....the Roman character in this film is ""Joe""...actually the same character drawn with the strong jaw and same voice. It doesn't work. So, for a guy who raced home after school and got up early on Saturdays to watch the Rocky & Bullwinkle Show with Mr. Peabody and Sherman, this movie failed in every aspect that a movie could fail, except for the animation. The animation was commendable."
11,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,1,8 March 2014,Big Disappointment,"I was so excited when I heard they were doing a re-make of Mr. Peabody, one of my all time favorite characters from the BEST animated show ever done, Rocky and Bullwinkle. However, anyone who is familiar with the original will be seriously disappointed. Ty Burrell's portrayal of this one of a kind cartoon character is awful. His voice doesn't even come close to capturing the attitude or personality of the original which was voiced by the inimitable Bill Scott. With a silver spooned cadence reminiscent of early film stars such as Clifton Webb, Mr. Scott perfectly captured the somewhat snooty and totally self-satisfied Mr. Peabody. Ty Burrell sounds like an actor who is trying too hard to capture those qualities. His Mr. Peabody is lifeless and dull. He is unable to capture the essence of the character and so the whole film falls flat."
12,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,5 April 2014,High Quality Animated Fun,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsWow! This film came out of nowhere and sprung a huge, pleasant surprise on everybody. Quite frankly, ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"", is one of the most endearing animated films in a long, long time, something nobody would have wagered on before its release. Along with being a wonderful nostalgic trip for fans of the old ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" cartoons; viewers with no previous knowledge of the animated shows will also immediately warm up to the charms of this cinematic treat.Mr. Peabody is a business tycoon, inventor, scientist, gourmet chef, two-time Olympic medalist, and a genius  who also happens to be a dog. Using his most ingenious invention, the WABAC machine, Mr. Peabody and his adopted boy Sherman, hurtle back in time to experience world changing events first-hand and interact with some of the greatest historical icons of all time. But when Sherman breaks the golden rule of time travel, our two protagonists find themselves in a race to repair history and save the future. ALong the way, Mr. Peabody may face his biggest challenge yet  being a parent.There's something inherently special about ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" besides being a zesty, soaring, breakneck adventure. It offers two important lessons - on history and loyalty - told subtly and wrapped in humor and fun-filled escapades. The trips taken by the adventurous duo to landmark events back in time are outrageous and amusing to the hilt, yet educational enough to ignite any child's interest in history. In fact, this film should be screened across all schools to reignite students' fervor in history, a subject towards which most children don't show a keen affinity.The other and perhaps most valuable lesson imparted by the movie is that of loyalty. The abounding loyalty of a dog and how we can all learn treasured life's lessons from this inherent quality our canine friends possess in copious amounts.Overall, ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" is a zany, exciting, endearing, pacy ride, filled with witty dialogues, irresistible charm, and some valuable lessons."
13,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,14 March 2014,"""I have a fond regard for you, too!""","Indeed, I have ""a fond regard"" for this film as well. This film, while not be DreamWorks' best, still manages to deliver a lot of fun and sometimes, even heartfelt (or whatever the word is) moments.This film centers around a dog genius named Mr. Peabody and his adopted son named Sherman. Mr. Peabody has this time machine called WABAC, which enables both him and Sherman to travel through various timelines in history. Unfortunately, Sherman tells his nemesis, Penny (whom Sherman got into a school fight with), about WABAC, which triggers the entire event of the film.The voice actings are not the best I've heard, but still great. Their voices fit very well with characters they play - including Ty Burrell as Mr. Peabody and Stanley Tucci as Leonardo Da Vinci. Also, if any of you is worried about Penny being annoying, fear not - she is not actually annoying and contributes to a large part of the film, and not to mention Ariel Winter's voice acting as well.Some of you may have noticed that Sherman and Penny's heads were disproportionately large, but this might be due to source material's animation style.So, how did it failed to get 10/10? Here is my feedback:-Convoluted third act: The moment where we see two Mr. Peabodys and two Shermans combine with each other (that means two Mr. Peabodys combine with each other and two Shermans combine with each other), the plot starts go a bit strange as historical figures from different time periods all start to appear at once. Also, if they go to the future to fix these problems, wouldn't the future be... a bit more... messy?Overall, though, 'Mr. Peabody & Sherman' is a great animated film for both children and adults alike. Its animation style, great characters and voice actors, good story (despite the third act issue), and Danny Elfman's score will entertain people in pretty much all ages.P.S. For those of you who don't know much about Robespierre, he's one of leaders of French Revolution. Unfortunately, he became a very vicious ruler and led Reign of Terror, which about 16,000 people got killed from guillotine! Eventually French decided that Robespierre was no better than French monarch, and he lost his head on guillotine as well."
14,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,1,7 August 2014,Not for kids or anyone with a brain,"I never saw the original cartoon but this one from dreamworks is a pile of vile.Might contain spoilers ... you've bee warned !First it is openly racist and judgemental : Egyptians are brutal and barbaric, French are cake lovers or single minded psychopath, Italians are always angry at each other and laugh at stupid jokes, Greeks are dumb bloodthirsty savages ... and only US scientist and politics are righteous ... yeah rightSecond it is sexist and misogynist : the female characters are depicted in a foul way - Penny's mom is an obedient and stupid housewife - The woman from child abuse protection association is judgemental, egoistic and raging - Penny is just an evil little brat that turned out to nothing else than a damsel in distress at the end (she is not even get the credit from flying Leonardo's flying machine in the first placeThird : lots and lots of historical unforgivable and unjustified mistakes. They are accurate when it comes to the story behind the first president of the US but everything else is false (and yet again, judgemental and racist in a way)Fourth, cheap sense of morality mixed with weak and misleading psychology treat : (quoting peabody) ""Every great relationship comes from a place of conflict and evolve into something richer"" yeah right ... tell that to people stuck in war-zone in Africa or middle-east.(and another delightful one) ""If you don't like a person, it's quite often because they remind you of something you don't like about yourself"" ... silly me, I sought the reason we we hate some individual is because they did us wrongI never follow the PG rating because I don't trust anybody else than my wife and I when it comes to what is good for my kid's education and I certainly did the right choice about this! This animation is definitely harmful to kids judgement about reality and right and wrong balance and degreeSo this movie should never be presented to any kids or to anyone with a brain (or living in one of the country depicted in this crap animation) movie)"
15,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,3,1 December 2016,Skip it.,"The only reason I wasted my time watching this is because it has something like an eighty percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Anyway, this film is a disorganized mess. It is like a bunch of not particularly funny episodes of Sherman and Peabody pasted together in an attempt to fill up the required one and a half hours of bullSh!t on the screen. As you can tell, I am not a fan. There is a moral lesson sandwiched in there somewhere but it doesn't matter because the film is choppy, uninspired and unfunny. I do recall laughing once. It wasn't a laugh, more of a chuckle. But whatever, save yourself the pain and skip it. It is a waste of time you will regret unless you're under the age of seven. I wouldn't even recommend it as a family film."
16,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,15 March 2014,A Fun Movie for Kids but not Dreamworks best,"I never grew up with The Rocky and Bullwinkle show, so I went into this film knowing absolutely nothing about the set-up or plot in the original cartoon. As a whole this movie works reasonably well for a younger audience, it's huge fun and is pretty entertaining. I just don't think this is one of Dreamwork's best and I wish it could have been more creative and clever with the time-travel aspect. The motion sequences are well done (especially when the characters are surfing the sewers of Paris or flying on Da Vinci's flying machine), and the majority of the characters are hugely likable (especially Mr Peabody and Sherman themselves), but the plot is a little bit all over the place, occasionally has some weak script writing and most jokes fall flat.It's safe to say that all the best parts are in the trailer and I really hope that Dreamworks does better next time, but overall this isn't a bad movie for kids and could even appeal to the Horrible Histories crowd (no matter what age they are)."
17,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,20 February 2014,"Jokes for kids, jokes for grown-ups","I approached this film with low expectations. I took my nine-year-old son to see it, ready to endure it with clenched teeth. My son loved it; and to my surprise, so did I. Sure, it's formulaic and weaves its own little morality tale: but it's also fast-paced, inventive and funny. Some of the jokes are aimed at nine-year-olds, some at their dads. My son has no idea at who Bill Clinton was, or why I laughed at the line, ""I'm Spartacus,"" and there was one double entendre which made me bite my lip whilst praying that it went over his head. But even if we regarded different parts of the film as highlights, we both had a great time, and that can't be bad.One point, though. Whilst the film correctly informs its audience that the young George Washington never chopped down a cherry tree, it misses a chance to declare that Marie Antoinette never said, ""Let them eat cake."""
18,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,6 March 2014,History Comes Alive,"At first I was not interested to watch this film since the poster looked absolutely juvenile. The characters and the title did not appeal, looking and sounding so old-fashioned. My kids did not really want to watch it as well. However, good initial reviews got me intrigued to see it.Mr. Peabody is special little white dog who can talk, read tomes, graduate college, earn a Nobel Prize, an all-around talented character, who can do anything under the son. He adopts an abandoned baby boy named Sherman due to his desire to give the boy what he never had growing up, a home. Mr. Peabody and Sherman share a secret activity together, traipsing around history with an amazing time machine. This invention by Mr. Peabody can take them to any time in history he likes, allowing them to meet and be friends with all the great figures in history.On Sherman's first day at school, a sassy little girl named Penny bullies him, and he retaliates by biting. This altercation leads to a series of events which may cost Mr. Peabody not only his custody of his beloved Sherman, but may alter the whole fabric of human history as we know it.The whole absurd concept of a genius dog adopting a boy really did not ring well with me. Thankfully, the execution and the story about them travelling through history did sustain my interest. As a history buff, I enjoyed seeing the various periods in history and the characters come alive and interact with our protagonists. Kids who have no interest in history will probably just laugh shallowly at the crazy visual comedy.The animation is okay, a bit on the old-fashioned style. Dreamworks characters do not really grab you at first sight. ""Shrek,"" ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""The Croods,"" I almost did not watch because of the unusual (or even ugly) artwork. Luckily I was convinced to see them by good word of mouth, and I ended up loving them. This one I liked, not really love. 7/10."
19,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,8 March 2014,This a very well done and witty movie!!!,"I walked out the theater in a way better mood after seeing this picture! The animation was great (saw it in 3D) and the story was funny and intelligent!The animation is very stylized which makes it even more fun.They have advanced the old kid's cartoon series to a whole another level.They took the original and built on it with great skill and thought.It's still a kid's movie but is advanced enough for the adults too. Speaking of kids, they may actually learn a thing or two. However, don't think it's a real educational movie. Looking forward to the next installment. Just hope they can keep up the standard."
20,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,5,22 March 2014,"""Extreme"" re-imaginations really are threatening the space-time continuum..","On the off-chance that there is anyone left in viewer-land who actually is interested in the source material (and this reviewer did cover the original Rocky show right here in the IMDb) let's be clear --- Peabody and Sherman, like their counterpart, the Fractured Fairy Tales, were simply a mechanism, an artistic device if you prefer, intended to introduce bite-sized ""lessons"" (albeit entertaining and pun-ny) into the body of the show. Which they did. Brilliantly. The one lesson that was however conspicuously missing from the original show is that, one day in the far future, writers and producers would run out of original ideas (or, alternatively, become afraid to invest in scripts lacking a guaranteed, pre-existing, audience) and start to relentlessly ""mine"" old franchises for new stories. Which, in a nutshell, is how we got here. Now, to paraphrase Seinfeld (who, at this rate, may himself end up ""re-imagined"" in an animated feature!) there is ""nothing wrong with that"" on its face. Re-imagining can be fun. The live action Casper in 1994, for example, was both fun and sweet. The 1990s re-imagining of the 70s version of Battlestar Galactica was nothing less than brilliant. But re-imaginings can also go wrong. Horribly wrong in some cases -- Johnny Depp as Tonto comes to mind. (You probably have your own faves.) Which brings us back to Mr. Peabody. In the original, the ""backstory"" was never really explored because -- see above -- the characters were simply a learning device and nothing more. Nonetheless (or, perhaps, in spite of that) the producers of this feature took the one single solitary ""clue"" that was offered in the original -- the catchphrase so often voiced by Peabody, sic, ""every dog should have a boy"" -- and built an entire full-length Hollywood feature with the sole goal and purpose of turning that single catchphrase into a punchline!! Was it worth it? Is there entertainment here? It is the considered opinion of this reviewer that (notice the irony) time will not be as kind to this production as the present generation of reviewers is. FROZEN this ain't. Nor is it in the same class as Toy Story, Lion King, Coraline, or even (one of my personal faves) Over The Hedge. The fact is, the many (too many!) attempts in this film to explore the implications of a dog adopting a boy not only don't work nearly as well as the writers expected them to, but (much like the reference to Oedipus in the Trojan War segment) are not just a little creepy. What does almost work somewhat is the story of a shy boy trying to connect with the kids at his new school by trying to make an impression on the Alpha-female. It is no coincidence that the funniest line here (and there are not many to choose from) is when Ariel Winter (who does a great job playing Penny) explains to Sherman that she has already figured out what happens after her intended husband, King Tut, goes to an early grave. She plans to ""take it all."" The irony, I suggest, is that the writers were capable of extracting humor from the idea of a 7 year old girl getting married -- !! -- but incapable of extracting entertainment from the story of a dog actually trying to raise a boy. If the ""real"" Mr. Peabody were here, he would, I think, find a lesson, and maybe even a pun, in that tail..."
21,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,11 March 2014,"""I'm a dog, too!""","I've read some pretty mean-spirited ""external reviews"" for MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN, reinforcing my theory that many so-called ""professional"" reviewers have been ""at it"" WAY too long. (When it ""stops being fun,"" they should quit and make way for fresh eyes, like mine.) I saw this cartoon the day that ""Daylight Savings Time"" went into effect. If MR. PEABODY was as ""lame"" as the ""pros"" make out, my crowd and I should have been counting sheep by the middle of this film. Instead, everyone was laughing at the multitude of clever puns and sight gags included in this flick. MR. PEABODY is a heart-warming story about father-son, boy-dog, and boy-girl bonding. It trots out King Tut, Leonardo Da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Albert Einstein, among others. Even the evil New York City child welfare hag Mrs. Grunion finds her true love in the Greek king Agamemnon (though she would probably end up baking their children into pies or something worse). Final word: two paws up!"
22,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,10,9 March 2014,"Treat your kids. Most of all, treat yourself!","Finally, a movie that relates to both kids and adults. Exceptional story line and dialogue. As a big fan of the ""original"" Mr. Peabody and Sherman from that ""Moose and Squirrel"" show, this adaptation to the big screen did not disappoint. In all honesty, I was expecting a half-hearted, half-baked premise that would have me checking my watch after about 15 minutes. Not so. The movie did a great job in every aspect imaginable; character development, historical references, humor, and song (thanks to a well-placed masterpiece by John Lennon). Extremely entertaining all around. A lot of the history might be lost on the younger set, but there is no harm in exposing them to things of interest, is there? Leonardo da Vinci was my personal favorite. You might see more biography projects at school. One could hope."
23,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,19 March 2014,"Brian from Family Guy, ain't got nothing on Mr. Peabody","I briefly remember the old Mr.Peabody and Sherman cartoons, the thing I'm glad here is that they did not try to make it live action, and make Mr.Peabody a CGI thing. They over did it with The Smurfs and the Soooby Doos.Building a time traveling adventure story with the smart dog Mr. Peabody and his adopted human son named Sherman. Has the two meet some of the famous and some infamous people of history. But it also the warmth father and son relationship between Peabody and Sherman. It never takes it self to seriously, it is just fun ride for everybody to enjoy. Ty Burrell voices Mr. Peabody with perfection, the rest of the cast are also great, the animation is top notch also."
24,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,8 March 2014,Nice combination of fun and history,"First, let me say that I am not a BIG fan of animated films and while I enjoy them for about 2/3 of the way through, I usually look forward to the end. So for me to say i was a bit bored, well, that's the way i feel about most of them.However, growing up, I was a big ""Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan,"" with ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" being my favorite segment. In that department, this movie does not disappoint. You get a little education and a lot of classy puns, which make it especially enjoyable for adults--not groaners, real laughs.My biggest complaint is the trend in animation of HUGE heads on stick figures, but that is a criticism of the entire genre, and I am told it is following the popular Japanese style.What I did find disturbing--SLIGHT Spoiler--was the extremely negative depiction of the woman from ""children's services."" With all the abuse going on these days in the U.S., I would hope that children see these workers as people who can help them when they need it, not destroy families. The upside was a positive portrayal of adoption.So go see it, and if you take your children, use it as a jumping off place for history lessons and alternative families."
25,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,3,9 March 2014,Blah Blah and Blah,"Mr. Peabody has always been smarter than anyone in the room, on the television screen or in this case, the theater, so it should come as no surprise his movie would try simultaneously catering to older and younger audiences, which might just cause all ages to scratch their skull-covered cerebellums at the same timeFull of intentionally bad puns, pop culture inside jokes and a relationship between dog scientist and boy doofus that borders on creepy, we get an unnecessary flashback about how the Nobel prize winning mutt wound up adopting a boy, Sherman, who, unlike his canine master, is as dumb as a box of nails.This backstory is like explaining why a rabbit talks to a duck, why a moose lives with a flying squirrel or... well... you get the point.After a tedious setup, the duo hops back in time to save a little girl, Penny, Sherman's new friend that joined him in Peabody's Way-Back Machine. If things go wrong, Peabody won't be able to keep his son yet it's really about the adventures and misadventures within each particular timeline: From the Trojan War to a stopover at Leonardo DiVinci's studio, the action scenes are nice to look at but the dialogue is, for the most part, awkward and unnerving, as are most of the side-characters...Leading to an 11th hour climax combining a ton of historical exposition that, like our hero namesake, is more brainy than entertaining."
26,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,2,20 September 2014,"Weak Execution when it Comes to the Plot,but it is just one of the so good its bad movies","When I watched this movie which I was glad I did not watch it in cinemas and also glad that I did rent out the movie,I was both having two feelings. Surprised and disappointed. Surprised because DreamWorks did improved in the quality of the characters personality and also the characters design as well as the animation.But at the same time,freaking disappointed when it comes to the scriptwriting,especially when it is written by no other than Rob Minkoff,who is the same person who directed the simple yet terrific Lion King. Okay,the scene when Penny bullies Sherman is powerful,but is there any scenes or themes that could match well with that,and also the worst point is that they DON""T HAVE THE EXPLANATION ON WHY IS SOME CHARACTERS LIKE THAT.Like why is Penny becoming a bully all the sudden,did she have a dark past?Or why is Penny's father also the same too,and why is the villain,the child adopter agent being so vicious all the sudden.Or why did Penny change her mind after a young Tutankhanum tried to kill her by showing the picture and how could she all the sudden change her mind after a simple explanation and follow Sherman after that so called explanation.Come on,this is a huge example of how a weak script is written.Of course,it is DreamWorks,what did you expect,they did only produce one freaking good show which is How To Train Your Dragon and nothing else.From the horribly Antz to another either horrible movie to a mediocre movie,I noticed that they did have a lacking department for story development.They were always taking the tropes from TV Tropes and plays with them as often as they can.Boy wants to Attract girls,genius and his kid anything,this movie plays with the clichés and use them as an excuse to make a movie that could appeal to little kids.Well sorry,no more of this anymore,this HAS to STOP because I noticed that this is the trend that many animation studios were doing these days,except Pixar and Disney.The good point is that this movie has a potential to be remembered by generations and the voice acting were quite good but seriously,everything feels rush the script,the story,the dialog and also the animation no offense feels effortless and rushed.I mean everything is rushed,sure,you can't compare with the superior movies in animation like Toy Story or The Incredibles or How To Train Your Dragon but it is a lesson that anyone can still do a better movie based on the script itself and not so much of the animation quality.It is also thank goodness that this movie flopped that people realized that the unnecessary pop cultured jokes type of movie is dead too.This movie should be a lesson on how to avoid making a bad movie besides Frozen. My rating :1.1/2 out of 5(Really bad)"
27,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,13 April 2014,A great film for people of all ages,"Mr. Peabody and Sherman is about Mr. Peabody, an intelligent dog that has accomplished just about everything, and his adopted human son, Sherman. The two of them travel to the past and explore historical events using a time machine called the WABAC. On Sherman's first day of school, he displays his knowledge of history in class and makes his classmate Penny jealous. She bullies him for having a dog as a dad and they both get into trouble. Mr. Peabody attempts to appease the situation by having Penny and her parents come over for dinner, but some more problems arise when Penny and Sherman decide to use the WABAC unsupervised.The movie's storyline was solid and I really enjoyed the characters' developments. There was a lot of witty humor as well as interesting historical facts. The voice acting was also excellent, all of the voice actors really brought life to their characters. I especially enjoyed Ty Burrell's voicing of Mr. Peabody, his voice was so clear and really fit the character. All of the scenery in the movie was animated beautifully. They travel to many places so you will always be viewing new landscapes. The movie really covered a variety of places including France, Egypt, and Greece. It also featured important figures like George Washington, Marie Antoinette, and Leonardo Da Vinci. I also thought it was great that the movie covered important issues like bullying and discrimination. Penny's change from being a mean bully to becoming Sherman's good friend was really heartwarming. Seeing all the characters in the movie stand up for Mr. Peabody in the end was also very inspiring to see. It really sent out a good message to all viewers.My only complaint is that some of the dialogue could be hard for children to understand. I found the information on the WABAC's mechanics hard to follow, so I would assume children had an even harder time trying to comprehend it. A lot of the jokes were also hard to catch unless you remember everything from history class. Overall, the movie was so fun and interesting to watch. It had all the elements a good movie needs: character developments, strong storyline, beautiful animation, and good moral lessons. I was impressed by how well they integrated education into this movie. Learning was fun and I kept looking forward to finding out new facts. It is a movie everyone can relate to and enjoy; I highly recommend it."
28,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,1 April 2014,"Say your prayers, Disney... Dreamworks is coming!","Well, Pixar's not coming back to originality for another year. In other news...All right, all right. Let's get to the point. (I'm ghostwriting for the dog). Frozen has taken the world by storm ( Leave the clever puns to me! ) and Lego Movie was a fun little detour from expectations of the merchandising variety. You know what these animated movies lack? Plot line. I only say this because, although gorgeous, Frozen's plot line is flimsy and the Lego Movie? Uh... it had a plot line? Vignettes of brilliancy a perfect film doth not make. What we have here, short of calling it a masterpiece, is a very good, solid film. The kind of film you want your kids to see. It is, as always, DreamWorks. But... The Incredibles is to Pixar what this film and How To Train Your Dragon are to Dreamworks. They are with no exceptions and the only rules are the ones they want to make... or break. Whatever comes first. The writing, pacing, humor, characters are top notch, so pristine that the occasional flop of poorly animated adults doing stupid things will make you wince. Peabody is one step ahead of Bugs. Never looking at the bottom because he's always on top. His relationship with his son and the words exchanged, are touching and realized. We are all dogs, every darned one of us. It's formula, but you see the Lion King in flow in there... yes, please view the casting and directors. ;) You will not be disappointed in seeing this very special little film and if this is just the appetizer, I CAN'T WAIT to see what HTTYD 2 has cookin'."
29,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,22 March 2014,"""All this zipping around the cosmos has drained our power supply!""","After reading some other reviewers here, I definitely concede having grown up in a different era. There are more than several comments on this board regarding the bullying that takes place in the story. Now I watched the whole picture and never even gave that a second thought. Just like I never gave a serious thought to Wile E. Coyote trying to catch the Roadrunner, or Tom and Jerry beating up on Spike. Because it's not real. And I never thought when I was a kid that it was alright to bully other kids who were smaller or different from me. But with today's emphasis on the subject, and especially with the anonymity that goes with the internet, bullying is obviously a serious issue. But I don't think the picture is going to influence anyone in that direction.Well that's my little aside. It's been a long time since I've seen any of the original Mr. Peabody cartoons and I'll probably have to get me one of those WABAC machines to do it right. But from what I remember, this flick hit on the highlights, and brought back to mind the way the original Peabody would analyze his subject with drawings and diagrams to explain how he solved a particular problem. As expected, his adopted boy Sherman managed to get into one scrape after another until Dad found a way to bail him out.Updated for a modern audience, Sherman and his female counterpart Penny head for various eras in history, making stops in ancient Egypt, the French Revolution, and Florence, Italy during the time of Leonardo da Vinci. The second part of the story would make your head hurt if you were trying to logically follow the whole time travel business, as characters from throughout the ages randomly pop up. The story takes on the serious consequences of meeting your own self in a different time line, but obviously played for amusement and teaching some timeless lessons along the way. When it was over I thought to myself that yes indeed, every dog should have a boy."
30,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,7 March 2014,Nostalgic Fun for Adults & Kids,"I saw ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"", starring the voices of Ty Burrell-Modern Family_t.v., Dawn of the Dead_2004; Max Charles-The Neighbors_t.v., The Amazing Spider-Man_2012; Ariel Winter-Modern Family_t.v., Speed Racer_2008 and Allison Janney-Mom_t.v., The West Wing_t.v.This is an animated movie that is based on a segment from an old t.v. show by Jay Ward called 'The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show'-1959 to 1964. The 5 minute segment was called 'Peabody's Improbable History' and it usually ended with Peabody saying a really bad-but funny-pun about their recent adventures. For those unfamiliar with the series, Peabody was a talking dog that was also a genius at almost everything. Ty does the voice for Peabody. Ty has a son named Sherman, voiced by Max-and yes, they show how they got together. Ty invented a WABAC-pronounced 'Way back'-machine that would travel through time. Ty would take Max on time trips and teach him history. Ariel plays a bullying classmate of Max that gets into lots of trouble and Allison plays a social worker that tries to prove that Ty is an unfit parent to Max. As I mentioned earlier, there are lots of puns and even though it appeals more to nostalgic people that watched the original t.v. shows, it is still funny for both adults and kids. It's rated ""PG"" for some mild action and a little rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."
31,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,7 March 2014,who's the master?,"OK. I went to this movie just because 300 wasn't yet released. Yes, it was fun and since it was animation you can expect sort of goofs and innuendos. Well, lets get to it, shall we?An highly intelligent dog named Mr.Peabody adopts a kid named Sherman ( This made me finally understand it happens only in kids movies) and sends him to school. The kid is also intelligent thanks to Peabody's time machine. This gets him into trouble with a bullying girl named Penny. To solve the matter Peabody invites the girl's mother and father to dinner. Sherman inadvertently shows Penny the time machine and she takes a trip to past. During the trip they break the time line and all hell breaks loose. The rest is how Peabody solves and brings everything back to normal.OK. Time travel and its rules are always the same in every movies it was used. The idea of a genius intellect of a dog adopting a boy did not sit tight with me. And the kid is also called a dog because his father is a dog is a little uncalled for. The rest is fine. I had a lot of laughs, tried to forget the innuendos, Agamemmnon smelling his armpits,at times Ty Burrell did sound British, Patrick Wartburton as always is hilarious with his gravel voice,time travel for kids-unnecessary(they just wont understand).Other than all that you just might should take your kid on the weekends as a fun family movie to watch. Go for it."
32,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,2 March 2014,"Entertaining and moving, but with its flaws.","Dreamwork's latest offering draws its inspiration from a series of cartoon sketches featured in ""Bullwinkle and friends"" from the 1950's. Mr Peabody is the smartest being in the world (who just happens to be a dog) and Sherman is his human adopted son.""Mr Peabody and Sherman"" is an enjoyable romp through history as the principal characters time travel their way through the past, by use of Mr Peabody's invention ""the WABAC"". The main purpose of this invention was to help Sherman learn first hand about the events of history under the protection of his adopted father. Rather predictably, things go wrong when unqualified persons use the WABAC and begin to cause havoc with the space-time continuum. But can the Nobel prize winning canine repair the damage and save the day ?A sub-plot has Sherman coming up against bullying at school for being super intelligent and mockery for having a dog as an adopted father. When Sherman defends himself, the evil school counsellor ""Miss Grunion"" (who is clearly jealous of Mr Peabody's intellect and achievements) threatens to take the boy out of his custody. She also further humiliates him by treating him as nothing more than a dog that belongs in the pound.Most of the characters the time travellers encounter in history are very ""Americanised"" and ""Agamemnon"" especially sounds like he belongs in New York rather than Troy.On one level, this film is a light hearted piece of children's entertainment, but it certainly has something for adults as well. Central to the story is Mr Peabody's genuine love for Sherman and the trials and tribulations of being a good father to him. Its touching to see how far he will go to protect him and educate him properly throughout. The ""beautiful boy"" montage was especially moving.A cut above many modern children's movies."
33,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,2 March 2014,Endearing little fun ride,"Didn't know that this was made by Rob Minkoff, responsible for 'The Lion King' and 'Forbidden Kingdom' (a lesser work for sure). His star has not been on the ascension, however, which has been a source of surprise for me, but his later works have been consistently weak(er). Anyway, this one had no talk at all, and that was surprising, considering that its turned out pretty decent. Not great for sure, but quite a bit of fun, for kids and adults alike. Some people are complaining about it not being hand-drawn, but I didn't have a frame of comparison.One bit of news though, was the initial bit of voice-casting that was for Robert Downey Jr. who was supposed to voice Mr. Peabody, who dropped out for unknown reasons, and was replaced by Ty Burrell (Modern Family). The animation's not bad, the 3D's pretty decent, the voice characterization's quite alright, and it also acts as a history lesson to young minds (though I'm not sure if it'll confuse them further, or act as a good thing). Time travel paradoxes are addressed in a simplistic manner though, and that would appeal to the young 'uns, though most of us who grew up on Primer / Looper / Vigalondo might not bite. nice, disposable entertainment, worth scoring brownie points with the kids on, while we wait for 'How to train your dragon 2'.I still am confused about certain choices made for the characters (by the writers and quite possibly the helmer), and those kinda take everything away from how much stronger this could've been."
34,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,17 May 2014,About Time!,"I grew up watching the Rocky and Bullwinkle show and enjoy most of the episodes, not just the stars themselves, but the fractured fairy tales, Mr. Know-It-All, Dudley-Do-Right, Aesop and Son, and Bullwinkle's Corner. I occasionally enjoyed Peabody and Sherman, though most of the time I found it dull and boring, but I still like how they fractured up history, like if you wanted to know why Napoleon has his hand in his shirt it is because he's holding up his pants. It was always about how the duo would go back in time, and Peabody would come up with solutions to save the day. The two movies Rocky and Bullwinkle, and Dudley-Do-Right flopped horribly, and when I heard Dreamworks was doing Peabody and Sherman I just screamed, ""NO! It's bad enough Hollywood messed up two of the most beloved cartoons, and now this one???"" However I saw it was getting good reviews, and decided to give it a view and it surprised me from beginning to end!For starters, they actually open up the film the exact way they did the first episode! Right away I started cheering, but at the same time kept my eyes open for any flops! I could hardly find any faults; Peabody and Sherman were the same characters from the original cartoon except now more three dimensional (both literally and figuratively). They actually establish family issues, like why Sherman has a ""daddy"" dog, and how Peabody doesn't always know how to deal with Sherman, though in the original he was considered Peabody's pet and not as much here. I love how the Way Back was updated, how it's not just a simple door you walk through, but almost looks like a space orb going through time. But the two things I loved best was how much of a genius Peabody was and how they always make friendly references to the original cartoons, like the adoption court case, Peabody's always cracking puns, and how at the end there's the janitor sweeping up!I'm not quite sure what is with the I'm a Dog speech near the end, but it was somewhat cheesy and I already hate the one dimensional villain, and the show didn't have a lot of butt jokes, but I guess I could let it pass because it doesn't happen a lot. There were also moments I felt like I was watching Finding Nemo like when Leonardo De Vinchi comments how Sherman's growing up, and how Peabody says that Sherman can't do certain things like drive the Way Back or fly De Vinchi's plane when he's clearly doing fine on his own. I also don't quite like Sherman and Penny together, mainly because they don't share any chemistry. We first see her picking on him because he's adopted by a dog (understandable), but when Peabody says that he likes her and Sherman starts showing signs in the way he talks about her I was just shaking my head. When before then did the writers ever indicate that they liked each other? Sure people who hate each other can start liking each other, but this was rushed without even giving us a five minute moment of him starting to like her apart from her being a bully. Aside from that, it was a great movie and did not spit in the face of the original cartoons as I thought it would. When you get the chance, see it; it's worth your time."
35,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,1 May 2014,"Well, doggone it! Whenever you got a Ruff day! Watch Mr. Peabody & Sherman! I woof it! It's pretty funny.","Being a fan of the 1960's animated television series, 'The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show'. I found the Peabody's Improbable History segments to be a lot better than the other segments like Dudley Do Right & Fractured Fairy Tales. This movie was in production for years until Director Rob Minkoff put together this film. I really glad, they didn't go live action with this as the other movies based off the 1960s animated television series were. Animation was the way to go. Like the show, the movie plot is similar. Mr. Peabody (voiced by Ty Burrell) and his adopted boy Sherman (Voiced by Max Charles) travel back in time in a time machine to experience world-changing events first-hand and interact with some of the greatest historical figures. The movie theme is mostly about fatherhood as Mr. Peabody tries everything to make Sherman is ready for life. There is a really great music montage to the tune of John Lennon's 'Beautiful Boy' in the middle of the film that shows how much Mr. Peabody loves his son. Mr. Peabody's main chunk of his character development is him learning to cope with Sherman as he grows and changes, and struggling to be a good father despite the emotional complexity of it all. Supposedly, Mr. Peabody was treating Sherman like a pet and assistant as in the Rocky and Bullwinkle segments, rather than his son. Honestly, I don't see it here in this film, but clearly in the show, Mr. Peabody did. While Sherman and Mr. Peabody are very close to each other, the outside world doesn't think Mr. Peabody is fit to be a good father because he is a dog. There are underline message about discrimination and being prejudiced here that works. It really does help teach the kids, not to discriminate anybody. Too bad, nobody told that to Penny Peterson (Voiced by Ariel Winter) who bully Sherman at school because he was raised by a dog. Honestly, she's the worst and the cause of most of their problems and conflict. Trying to resolve the issue, Mr. Peabody invite her family for dinner. However, the plan horribly backfires when Sherman breaks the rules to show that he's more than a dog by showing Penny the WABAC time machine. Penny then hijack the WABAC and cause havoc throughout time. Now our heroes must race to repair history before Penny destroy more of it. One thing, I really hate about this movie is Penny. I thought it was a bit forced to have Sherman and Penny, secretly liking each other. Honestly, I don't like how the film is literally saying that abusive relationships are OK. Another character wasn't needed is Mrs. Grunion (Allison Janney). One dimensional character that if you take away. Doesn't affect the main plot, much. Despite that, the movie is pretty entertaining. The movie has a lot of good smart humor that can be a hit or miss, depending on the person. I like how the film kept the awful puns in it. It does add a lot of poop jokes. Some of those are alright. There are tons of pop culture references that are worth looking for. I love the 300 references, Bill Clinton, & I'm Spartacus joke! Also look for a lot of historical cartoony cameos. George Washington, Marie Antoinette, Jackie Robertson, and others. My favorite is Agamemnon (voiced by Patrick Warburton) and Leonardo Da Vinci (voiced by Stanley Tucci). I didn't mind the film breaking the Fourth Wall for some odd reason, the time travelling paradoxes, silly racial historical stereotypes or the historical inaccuracies that can scattered around this film. I wouldn't say, the movie is good enough for a history or science lecture, but it wasn't that bother-some. Honestly, if the movie told history and science correctly, it might be either be too boring or too gruesome for kids. At less, the movie is more historical accuracy than the show. It make kids interested in finding out what real history and science is about. Still, the movie is pretty dark at some points of the film, as it portray the sacking of Troy, and the events leading up to the French Revolution. Surprising the movie is very close to the source material. It even has the sweeper guy at the end. It's just update a few things like the appearance of the WABAC machine and others to a modern settling. Much of the opening to this film, is taken from the first appearance of Mr. Peabody in the cartoon show. The animation is way better than the show. While in the movie is in 3-D, don't mistakes the movie 'Mr. Peabody and Sherman' glasses and bow-tie for the 3-D glasses. Overall: The story could been a little bit more tuned up, but other than that it was a very funny and smart!"
36,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,5 April 2014,My childhood has just been re-energized...,"I can find only praises for this film. Preparing for the film, I skipped all trailers or references. I simply went to the theater thinking how would good old Peabody be trashed by today's media. Well, low and behold I was pleasantly surprised with the same zing and corny humor of the old 'Peabody's Improbable History' that I was raised on, while finding great enjoyment in the fact that there were still ways to freshen it up with a strong story, fun characters, lots of action and some very entertaining filming and effects.It was wonderful to let go for those 92 minutes and just be a kid again."
37,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,1 April 2014,A surprisingly smart film for DWA and the director of The Lion King,"When I was a child, I remember watching the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon, but I haven't heard of the Mr. Peabody and Sherman segments. That is, until one day, when DreamWorks Animation was going to make it into a feature length film, I became interested and my brother and I went to see a few weeks ago. Then, as we saw it, we were very impressed because of how smart and entertaining this was it made me watch the cartoons.Although, it may not be in the same depth as say How To Train Your Dragon, Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Antz, Rise of the Guardians, and The Prince of Egypt because there are two problems. While the film moves at a breakneck pace, the second act is a bit convoluted. There is also bits of violence that can make little kids a bit scared, but at least there isn't a lot of it.Anyway, there are a lot of good things that saved the movie. The script is witty and smart with several bits of good humor to keep adults and their kids laughing while teaching some historical bits to entertain them. The story is also good because of it's father-son relationship moments which made me tear up a bit. Also, the dialog is beyond fantastic, the music score from Danny Elfman is pretty good with a whimsical tone and an adventurous feel to it, and the voice cast is likable.Ty Burrell did a solid job as the canine genius Mr. Peabody and his puns never fail to amuse me. Max Charles also did a good job as Sherman, a sidekick who proves that he's more than just ordinary person. Penny starts out as a jerk at first, but as the film progresses, she started being nice. The other characters are good especially the historical figures including Leonardo Da Vinci and King Agamemnon voiced by Patrick Warburton who steals the show for me.The best part, however, goes to the animation. The visuals look nice including the look of Mr. Peabody's home, Egypt, Italy, Rome, and other places, but the character animation is what makes it work. I love how the animators made Mr. Peabody and Sherman almost look a bit like the hand drawn counterparts by having emotions.How I can ever repay DreamWorks Animation and Rob Minkoff, the director of my childhood favorite, Disney's The Lion King, for making a smart and entertaining adventure? Maybe I can get this on DVD when it comes out and I can watch it over and over again! So, to those who haven't seen it yet, go check it out. It's that good! :)"
38,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,14 March 2014,A Little Bit Of History For Us,"I saw this movie on Sunday with my mother for her birthday because she wanted to, and really, my sister and I were curious to see this old cartoon she kept raving about.Needless to say, I loved it. The voice acting was done well, the comedy and puns were great, and the adoption story woven in works without a hitch. We also learn lots about history, sometimes accompanied by awesome cartoon diagrams. You can accomplish almost anything with the marvelous techniques of CGI animation! One problem I did have though was the character of Miss Grunion, the CPS agent who tries to take Sherman away from Mr. Peabody. Shown once towards the beginning, she proceeds not to appear in any way shape or form until about 10-15 minutes before the climax. They could've put her in there somewhere in the middle for sake of consistency!Also, why would Sherman bite Penny? This seems like an odd occurrence unless Mr. Peabody was biting Sherman as a alternative to spanking while raising him. At first I thought Peabody might have sneaked in, but I don't think that's it.Also, the arrangement of former Presidents Washington, Lincoln, and Clinton near the end is fantastic.See this movie if you go see an animated kids film in the next few weeks. You won't regret it, especially in 3D!"
39,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,11 March 2014,An imaginative adventure that connects between the present and the past,"Ever imagine yourself traveling into the past using a time machine to meet some of the greatest human beings that ever existed that inspire you? Or perhaps worry about not being able to go back to where you came from by getting stuck in the past?If you do, it wouldn't hurt to watch this film as DreamWorks Animation, ""Mr.Peabody & Sherman"" has potential to lure you to venture a thrilling and fun trip that consists of intact ancient architects, lively culture and brief history of the past that you have learned in school as a series of hilarious events occur in two different dimensions. For the first time in history of mankind, Mr.Peabody, an erudite dog that nurtures his adopted son, Sherman who is a human that often gets called his names due to an unconventional relationship with his dad develops into a heartfelt story by overcoming nerve-wracking predicaments in the midst of riding on the circular time machine, WABAC.The only downside for me is the scientific artifices that Mr.Peabody exercises is too quick to catch up despite the brief explanations. The theory and exposition seem to be explained fast on purpose in order to express the intelligence of Mr.Peabody which leaves a huge question mark on many children in the theater, including myself. I wish they slowly elucidate them.Other than that, not only is it a great family movie to enjoy for all ages but it is also a different type of genre that has a unique plot and character development. And it is definitely something that should be presented as an animation instead of live-action, which is the main reason why it pans out."
40,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,1 March 2014,funny and witty  : Entertaining for someone new to Peabody,"NO SPOILERS. Before watching the movie, I didn't know a thing about peabody. The only reason that I went to watch the movie was that I 'have a deep regard' for talent involved in animation movies, Dreamworks especially.So, This opinion is a completely neutral, no contempt or nitpicking of a fan( or a hater).Things to look forward to : - lots of puns/satires referring to science/history/culture/language. If you have a decent knowledge of history, you cant help yourself but roll around laughing. - lots of slapstick comedy for kids. - Amazing details in expressions/mechanics of characters. Finally, This movie deserves more than 7/10. RT gave it 90% for a reason. I don't get the blasphemy that fans of previous versions are whining about but it delivers what it promises in the trailer.It is a funny entertainer. Just go with an open mind. You will be surprised. Me, along with seven of my friends were."
41,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,10 March 2014,The kids love it!,"Mr. Peabody & Sherman, when removed from the stigma of the original animated shorts, is actually a very well thought out and executed children's movie. The story mainly focuses on the relationship between Mr. Peabody and his adopted son Sherman, with the backdrop of the exciting historical adventure you come to expect from Mr. Peabody. It's fast paced and has lots of jokes that hit well with children and adult audiences a like. If I was keeping count I would bet that the adults were laughing much more than the little ones in the theater.One real issue I had with the story overall is the rushed ending that didn't feel on par with the rest of the movie. While logic in a children's time traveling movie isn't what sells tickets, I would have paid a little more attention to some of the ""facts"" and summed up the paradox a little cleaner. But really the only review that matters came from my seven-year-old daughter when asked on the way home how she liked the movie: ""Much better than Frozen."" So there you go DreamWorks Animation, straight from the mouth of babies."
42,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,9 March 2014,"""Peabody and Sherman"" A Four-Legged Delight","Before Bill and Ted and their telephone booth, Sam Beckett and his quantum leap and Doc Brown and his DeLorean, there was Mr. Peabody, the talking dog and his boy Sherman. In the 1960's, they were a staple on The Bullwinkle Show. They took young viewers back in time and learning about the history of the world, thanks to the transportation of their WABAC machine. The 1960's were good times. Now, we live in a more innocent and different era. But are we really ready for a Mr.Peabody and Sherman animated film? The answer, my friends, is a proud yes.Mr. Peabody (voiced by Modern Family's Ty Burrell) is a Harvard graduate, inventor of the fist bump and auto tune, a genius in math and athletics, a cool musician and a top notch seafood cook. He first finds Sherman as a little baby in the cardboard box and adopts him because Peabody wants something he didn't have when he was small, a home for him and didn't want his master to suffer as a result.In his first day of school, young Sherman (Max Charles) tells his fellow classmate Penny (Ariel Winter from Disney's Sofia the First) that her answer about George Washington chopping down a cherry tree is wrong. It then leads into a fight between them during lunch, which causes Sherman to bite Penny. Mr. Peabody decides to resolve the problem between them by inviting Penny and her parents (Leslie Mann and Stephen Colbert) to his Manhattan penthouse for a party. He tells Sherman not to tell Penny about the WABAC machine. But Sherman breaks his rule and sends himself and Penny to Ancient Egypt, where she gets engaged to King Tut. Mr. Peabody and Sherman try to stop the marriage and succeeds. On the way back to the present, Peabody, Sherman and Penny make pit stops to Di Vinci's workshop in Rome and the Trojan War. But, along the way, there are some complications which causes the time cycle to break and bring the figures of the past to the present.This is a giddy, heartfelt, laugh-out-loud-funny, guilty pleasure with something for everyone. It's faithful to the spirit of Jay Ward's classic cartoon and Craig Wright's script resonates to the relationship between father and son (or man to dog, in this matter). After spending a time in the live-action field, director Rob Minkoff (of Stuart Little and Lion King fame) returns to his cartoon roots and makes this a remarkable effort. The 3D animation is ingenious and superb.Burrell makes a perfect voice for Peabody, along with some wonderful puns that could rival Billy Crystal's on a stand up comedy night. Impressive voice support also comes from Charles, Winter, Colbert (who does a fine Fred MacMurray/Charles Grodin impersonation), Stanley Tucci as Di Vinci, Mel Brooks as Einstein and as King Agamemnon, Patrick Warburton (who have been doing a lot of voice work after Seinfeld went off the air).Thanks to the success of the Oscar-winning Frozen and The Lego Movie, animation is getting more popular nowadays and I hope this film continue this bandwagon as we move on into spring. Maybe, this film could impact dog adoptions to go up.Plus, come early for a zippy, hilarious short, Almost Home. It involves aliens trying to find a home planets. Steve Martin voices as the aliens' leader. It's good fun, as well as the film that plays after.Rating: Mr.Peabody and Sherman: ***1/2Almost Home: ***Parent Advisory: Rated PG for some mild humor and brief rude humor. A few off-color jokes, but it's still a smart and good companion for the entire family."
43,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,8 March 2014,A fun ride for kids; not so much for adults,"A kid suddenly started clapping and continued for around 30 seconds towards the end of the movie and that made me realize how much kids were really enjoying it. The best thing about the movie is that there was not a single dull moment. Something or the other keeps happening throughout the 1 and a half hour.The Peabody-Sherman relationship is endearing.However, the makers tried to bring a lot of events within a single frame which made many scenes seem like a hotchpotch to me. Also,some scenes look like they had been rather forced. This movie had the potential to be another of those Dreamworks classic animations. But sadly, it just remains as a Children's animation movie and not much more."
44,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,2,14 March 2014,Uninteresting,"When I saw the previews I thought to myself OK, there's no way I'm gonna miss this one. The clips revealed in the previews were funny and interesting and promised an educational movie for children and adults. I went to the theater with high hopes and was very disappointed. The only funny clips were the ones shown in the previews. I was a little stunned at the severity of the bullying and violence in this kids movie. It would have been more appropriate if rated PG 13. The movie took care to explain that Peabody the dog was awarded custody of a human child legally by a judge, yeah that's great, but every time they used the way back to go into the past, they were accepted by the inhabitants of that era as if they belonged. That's a little inconsistent in keeping up with the theme of the movie. Also them using the machine to go back in time had no historical or educational significance. This movie is another example of how kids flicks will always generate money no matter how awful they are."
45,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,3 March 2014,Fun and surprises everywhere,"I went to see the film with my kids, I didn't knew the story or the characters. It is also true that I was not expecting much from this movie. Actually the last ones I saw, however all were very successful, were boring and predictable. I ended up laughing a lot in the theater. The movie has references to many films, many old and ones. The historical characters are real and are very well used. I'm tired with films like Frozen or that kind boring and obvious. This film is fun and has surprises everywhere. It was a pleasant surprise for me have so much fun with this original and entertaining film. I was not alone and everyone in the theater clapped very satisfied at the end."
46,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,10,4 April 2014,Amazing! Didn't expect to be so wonderful!,"I will say that this is one of the best animations I've watched in my life! I didn't think it will be so awesome! It combines the entertainment in time travel, history and I had a good laugh! I wasn't expecting to be impressed, because it seemed like another story about time travel and after watching a few you get bored. But this was unique. Yet, in films I haven't seen anything different then a human making a time machine. Or using for something such as history studies. They've put true historical facts in the film witch is great for the younger to learn something interesting. I believe that it can even turn the attention to children that think that history is boring or useless. The humor is great! I haven't laughed like this since Despicable Me 2! And I don't find it as offensive humor either. It's also the perfect amount - not too less and not too much. The fact that these things are mixed in one bowl makes them even better. They've shown a curious for knowledge child, who travels in time to learn something new with his father, who is a dog, and has a laugh with the happening events.It also shows how two enemies that can't stand each other can become great friends. That is a voluble lesson for kids.The characters are presented in a fun way. Mr. Peabody can do more than any normal human and makes great first impressions with that. The characters from the past are represented in a funny way, but the humor still keeps the historical event correct. Unreal, funny, with knowledge and teaches you things about friendship. This is one of the many films that have impressed me with everything. That is why I give it a 10 stars rating. This is my opinion, I hope it helped."
47,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,2,1 August 2014,Mr. Perfect and His Annoying Adopted Son,"Where do I begin with this horrible movie?How about the trailer? Right when I saw all the pop cultural references in the trailers, I knew this one was going to stink. It was trying so hard to fit in with the ""hip"" crowd that I couldn't believe it when my grandmother told me to go see it. ""It's very funny"", she said. ""You'll love it,"" she said.And I might've. The time travel premise opens up near-infinite possibilities for locations and, because it's a kids film, I would've probably forgiven any plot-holes that time travel inevitably brings to a film. But, like the trailers, the movie failed to impress.Now, I'll admit right now, I didn't catch the first bit of this movie because I didn't go see it in theaters. I stayed as far away from it as I could until it appeared as an in-flight movie. I thought I'd suffer through it to see if it was really all that great, and suffer I did.For starters, this movie relies heavily on nearly every single cliché I despise: the bully, the Dumbass-In-Distress, the uptight and unyielding father figure. Throw in ""Hiding the Pet"" and ""The Liar Revealed"" and this movie would've had the complete set. I mean, COME ON, movie, I know you're not Dreamworks' big project for the year, but you could at least TRY to make your characters more than walking clichés.And speaking of clichés, Sherman has got to be the stupidest, most clichéd kid character I've seen in a long time. Say what you want about Short Round from Temple of Doom, but at least that kid brought SOMETHING to the table: he drove the car, he snapped Indi out of his stupor, he was kind of a scamp who despite his shouty-ness I kind of liked. Sherman brings nothing. He is every bit as stupid and rebellious as movie executives think kids are. He's short-sighted, he gives into temptation, he tries to impress the resident bully-cliché, and he always needs to be saved from his own unbelievable naiveté.As for his savior, Sherman is the most perfect character since the main man from the anime ""Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero"": always the one to provide the answer, always the one to save the day, always the one who bails out the Dumbass-In-Distress when said Dumbass gives in to their inherent nature. His only flaw is that he's an uptight and overprotective father, which makes him even less three-dimensional as a character. He should be the mentor figure who sits at home and sips tea while the hero goes on Campbell's Hero's Journey, not the hero himself.And finally, the biggest flaw in the movie: the story. This movie plays like a bad Disney sequel. Now, I will be the first to admit that I do like at least ONE bad Disney sequel (""Atlantis 2: Milo's Return"") and that said sequel plays out very much like this movie: a series of mini-adventures played out in different settings. The difference is that Atlantis 2, much like the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, bound this mini-adventures together with an over-arching story and/or theme. This movie, to me at least, did not have that. All too often they would take breaks from these mini-adventures to give us random, pointless filler in an already short plot fragment. Take, for example, their trip to Florence where they meet Leonardo DaVinci. While Mr. Peabody enlists DaVinci's help in repairing the time machine, Sherman is coerced by the resident Bully- Cliché into flying around in DaVinci's Flying Machine.And what did this add to the story? Well, aside from adding a subplot that I could see the outcome of a mile away, it succeeded in further adding to my already growing dislike for the film by portraying Sherman yet again as an annoying little turd who needed saving, as well as padding out the film.By the way, guess who causes the temporal anomaly that threatens to destroy the universe during the climax of the movie Now guess who figures out how to stop it. If you guessed AT ALL, then you'll have successfully come to grips with why I gave this movie its low score. Why isn't it lower? Because they cast Mel Brooks as Albert Einstein."
48,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,30 June 2014,I didn't know it's a good movie!,"It's a pretty good movie, you know. It teaches you father-son relationships. Well, between a father dog and his adopted human son.I found sometimes myself crying over the movie. There are some scenes that made me cry like when Peabody raising Sherman. it was so touching! and then i found myself laughing too! especially what always Sherman said,""I don't get it"". when he said that, i followed him all along. because i don't really get what Mr.Peabody said too. LOLBut i don't really like Penny's character, she's so mean in this movie but she got better at the end of the movie, though.even though this movie is a really non-sense movie,i still love it. just watch it,and you'll love it !"
49,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,29 June 2014,Animation's off to a roaring start in 2014.,"This is better than The Lego Movie.That get your attention?Hear me out.Everybody (the critics, your Aunt Ruth and the kitchen sink) went nuts over The Lego Movie. But it arose amidst a sea of shadow, Proverbial Audience.It's literally the first solid movie released in theaters this year.I think Lego's good. Mr. Peabody & Sherman is great. The difference shines through in the pacing.More specifically, it's the humor. Less objectively, it's the captivation.A superior adhesive glues my eyes to the screen during Mr. Pea & Sherm.Both movies are smart for different reasons. But Lego relies on a particular reveal; a moment of structural expansion which makes the narrative shimmer. And the laughs are regular but spaced out; some fall flat and it's never uproarious.It's slower and the good stuff is more sporadic.Mr. Peabody & Sherman hits home on more jokes of a higher caliber. Whether you dig the puns or not, it's definitely funnier.The story itself is also superior. It explores time travel in unique ways, distills historical legends and navigates a complex array of ideas.Strangely it seems easier to connect with the characters on a humanistic level. I'm not sure if it's because of their biological makeup (the fact that they don't exist in a Lego universe,) or just the tilted scales of investment.Anyway, that's my contrast. Got a problem with it? Let me know!Here's a bit more of what does and doesn't work in Mr. Perman.The central metaphor of the film tackles the inherent inconsistency of the original animated television series.A dog can't possibly be a sufficient parent, right?If he's a talking prodigy, perhaps, yes!What about a time-traveling one? With all the fundamental risk?Well, is he invincible?Technically the answer's yes, but that's obvious to anyone attending an animated feature.And yet they are smart enough to take things a step further, and not jam the obvious 'go-to' narrative down our throats.The details of Mr. Peabody's gaining the legal rights to adopt Sherman are quickly glossed over in less than twenty seconds. It reminds me of Kung Fu Panda 2, when Mr. Ping explains the story of finding Po in the radish basket. That scene can get quite dusty.The film's about common mistakes in traditional legends from history. Mr. Peabody warps them back to the distorted historical context, and illustrates to Sherman where the misconceptions arise.Then Sherman screws something up, and Mr. Peabody inevitably saves them through unbelievable circumstances. Sherman will inevitably ruin the impromptu remedy through extreme stupidity. Then the dog will, again, craft a split-second plan through means of ingenuity. And sometimes a third solution will be required before they end up safe in the WABAC.This formula's fine. It just drives me nuts after awhile.Eventually the question becomes: How's Sherman going to screw this up further? He nearly kills Peabody at one point!I always enjoy the 'mental schematic' editing technique. A similar effect is achieved in the Sherlock Holmes films (starring Robert Downey Jr.) in combat preparation, and to illustrate the calculative mind of Russell Crowe's character (John Forbes Nash Jr.) in A Beautiful Mind.As a final high note, I really like the relationship between the protagonist (Sherman, voiced by Max Charles, a mostly unknown child actor) and the antagonist (Penny Peterson) voiced by Ariel Winter.Penny's particularly great in the antagonistic role, because she's a female who physically bullies Sherman.But conversely, she's also his love interest. Which is different because she's taller than him.My sole criticism is I never really feel the stakes are high. And therefore, the central conflict is difficult to hone in on.Sherman's potentially going to be taken away by child services. Peabody may be dead at one point. Sherman's being forced to spend time with a girl who publicly humiliates him, and wrestling with the notion of loving a dog as a father figure. Who knows if we even like Penny yet? And all three of them are lost in the throes of time travel!It's tough to feel tension from any one particular direction.Then again, I really enjoy Mr. Peabody & Sherman and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and chucklesome ninety-minute ride.Don't wait for a scene after the credits, though.Sadly there isn't one.The omission is, by far, this film's greatest weakness."
50,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,20 March 2014,Perfect for Kids and Kids At Heart,"In the trailer for ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman,"" the hyper-intelligent dog learns that his adoptive human son and a classmate have hijacked his time machine. ""You used the WABAC?"" Mr. Peabody says. ""Yeah. She was into it,"" Sherman says. Whoever edited this is a genius, creating a new joke by removing a few lines of dialog from the final version of the actual scene (Sherman's friend was innocently ""into"" meeting George Washington) that had kids giggling and adults laughing for completely different reasons. In the actual movie, sly double entendres like this aren't common, but there's still one type of humor aimed at kids and another aimed at the kids at heart in the audience.""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" is a full-length extension of the ""Peabody's Improbable History"" shorts co-created by Jay Ward to pad out Rocky & Bullwinkle episodes. The last couple decades saw a slew of movies based on Jay Ward's creations. They were all occasionally funny but ultimately failures. So what makes ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" such an unmitigated success? First of all, it's completely CGI,allowing it to stay true to its cartoon roots while simultaneously giving it a more modern feel. It also broadens the humor of the original and adds emotional undertones to the story.Mr. Peabody is an almost flawless character, a genius scientist, inventor, adventurer, and exceptional host. (If you ever nab Mr. Peabody for one of your cocktail parties, be sure to have him mix up his specialty drink, the ""Einstein on the Beach"".) His skills seem limitless. But when Peabody discovers Sherman as an abandoned baby and legally adopts him, he finds out it's his parenting skills that still need work. Peabody creates the time-traveling WABAC machine as a teaching aid for Sherman.On his first day of public school, Sherman is naturally eager to show off his first-hand knowledge of history, making him very popular with some of his classmates, while earning him the ire of queen bee Penny Peterson. Soon a fight breaks out, bringing a dog's rights to legally raise a human child into question. (There are obvious socio- political metaphors that can be read into this, but I'd advise you to not go digging too deeply into a kid's movie, so you don't miss something wonderful going on at the surface.)To smooth things over, Peabody invites the Petersons over for dinner. One thing leads to another, and faster than you can say ""Don't show her the WABAC"", Penny's ditched Sherman somewhere in history, and it's up to Peabody and Sherman to travel through time and space to fetch her.Penny, a new character invented for the movie, adds a great new dynamic to the classic duo's time travels. She starts out comically self- centered, but soon she and Sherman develop their first crush on each other. Sherman's humility and compassion rub off on Penny, even as Penny's boldness and adventurousness rub off on Sherman. It makes for a satisfying character arc for Penny, a coming-of-age story for Sherman, and an opportunity for Peabody to come to terms with his boy reaching that age when he's more interested in spending time with girls than with his old maner, dog.The main relationship of the movie, though, is between the title characters. The story is littered with some surprisingly poignant father-son moments, and I found myself tearing up several times. But director Rob Minkoff strikes a perfect balance. Whenever the movie seems to be getting too maudlin, there's another great joke just around the corner. As expected with any Bullwinkle-related project, the movie's packed with plenty of groan-worthy puns. For example, Peabody takes Sherman to meet Marie Antoinette, only to quip, ""You can't have your cake and edict, too."" In a nod to how much humor has changed since the late 50's, Sherman invariably responds, ""I don't get it."" For kids in the audience, Sherman is quick to point out that ""King Tut"" rhymes with ""butt"" and that you can't say ""booby trap"" without saying ""booby."" For adults in the audience, there's Peabody's puns, as well as some more clever wordplay. Also, recent pop culture informs both the film's humor and its kinetic action sequences. There's an homage to Zack Snyder's ""300"" that I suspect is better than anything in ""300: Rise of an Empire"", which was playing in the theater next door.Ty Burrell does an appropriately brilliant job voicing Mr. Peabody, speaking with well enunciated syllables for as posh and intellectual of a cadence he can manage without slipping into a British accent, while adding a warmth that radiates through every line. Max Charles' and Ariel Winter's naturally youthful voices keep them believable as Sherman and Penny. Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann are both great as Penny's parents. Perhaps the film's only misstep is criminally under-using them. Patrick Warburton is hilarious as usual, with the movie's version of Agamemnon playing to his strengths as a likable meat-head.""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" is an amazing family movie. Don't have a family? A couple of the friends I went to see the movie with had their kids in tow, but I probably would have enjoyed it just as much if they weren't there. Not familiar with the source material? My memories of ""Peabody's Improbable History"" were vague at best. This reboot makes a great new introduction to the characters. It tugs at the heartstrings and tickles the funny bone. I just hope there are still plenty of adventures to come for this dog and his boy, and their new gal pal. Or, as Mr. Peabody would say, I hope they prove quite ""paw-pular."""
51,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,16 March 2014,History Repeats Itself...Yet Again!,"This film is mildly recommended.Sometimes new and improved just isn't. Nostalgia can be a double-edged sword, or in this case, a double-edged Trojan sword. It cuts both ways. We have an insatiable urge for a newer model, one that has similar traits that were once deemed endearing and comforting. Yet we somehow yearn for a better more refined chassis. Simply put, what was formerly our beloved past blurs our more-than-real present. The latest facsimile simply cannot compete with our fondest memories of our past experiences. ￼Most sequels fail for that reason, even if there is much thought and care put into that revised reincarnation. Mr. Peabody and Sherman is the latest victim. Yes, technically the colors are more sharper, and there is more visual depth and detail. Even 3-D techniques have been applied to enhance this final product. Gone are the simple outlines, outdated animation, and flat washed-out colors of the 60's versions. Unfortunately also gone are the wit and fun of the original. Instead we have more plot about Mr. Peabody's parenting skills and a preachy message about the importance of family as the adventurous duo go Waybac and meet various historical characters and events. Some naysayers may even say a hidden liberal agenda with the new normal family unit runs deep in this film. (I wouldn't though.) What ran deep for me is a wistful feeling of my childhood, sitting in front of the television watching my Saturday morning cartoons. Allow me to digress here. Animated cartoons of my past like Quick Draw McGraw, Beany and Cecil, Magilla Gorilla, Underdog and Sweet Polly Purebread, and Huckleberry Hound come into mind. Not to mention other diversions on view back then: shows like Yogi Bear, Top Cat, The Flintstones, Mister Magoo, Winky Dink and Me, and The Jetsons. (Ah, the glorious past!)￼And of course, the quintessential Rocky and His Friends, from 1959, was the staple of my childhood upbringing. This particular program became my personal rite of passage into more adult humor, with the cleverest of word play, puns, and jokes that I was just beginning to understand. The cartoons on that show included classic characters like Rocky J. Squirrel,and Bullwinkle J. Moose, Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, and segments like Dudley Do-Right, Fractured Fairy Tales (my favorite), Mr. Know-It-All, and Peabody's Improbable History, the story of a dog and his pet boy. It was Peabody's comical and abridged history lessons that inspired me to read up about the myths and legends as a child. Those cartoon shorts were quick-witted satire and the real hidden agenda of childhood education at its finest,before the advent of Sesame Street. It taught me everything I know and more.￼The 2014 version never reaches that level of excellence but is still entertaining and even highly amusing, sans the magic and charm. Many of the sight gags fall flat and the humor is of the hit-and-miss variety,but at least they tried. The artistry and craft is state-of-the-art, with fine voice-over support by Ty Burrell. Max Charles, Ariel Winter, Stephen Colbert, Leslie Mann, and especially Allison Janney and Patrick Warburton working overtime. Well directed by Rob Minoff, Mr. Peabody and Sherman may indoctrinate today's child into the world of yesterdays and long agos as it once did for me. Yet I'd rather have them (and myself) see the classic original outdated animation of a bygone era, with its simple outlines and flat washed- out colors, beautifully intact. Now that's history, improbable or not! GRADE: B-Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
52,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,11 November 2014,Loved MPS on R&B then and now,"I guess I'm just a fan of the concept of a dog adopting a boy. I was a fan of Mr. Peabody & Sherman shorts on Rocky & Bullwinkle they were the best ones in my opinion and now they are still amusing to watch. Either that or I'm just trying not to over analyze a kids movie.Ty Burrell does a good job at trying to capture the original voice which I can admit at first it is too much then you get over it by the middle of the movie. You have to remember it is the modern version. I enjoyed the movie I just did not get the addition of the fifth wheel which was Penny in this movie. I felt like part of the story line could of fit in a sequel, but should not have been in the first movie. They could of had the first movie about who Mr. Peabody & Sherman is, then they could have a sequel where Sherman is teased and ends up going against the grain and turning into a bad boy.Still nonetheless this will have to go in the book as the best Rocky & Bullwinkle (spinoff??) movie thus far. I don't think any of the Rocky & Bullwinkle movies did them any justice. Making the animated characters meet with the real world was something only Roger Rabbit could accomplish and it did not seem right for Rocky & Bullwinkle. Mr. Peabody & Sherman stayed in it's lane and gave us the full story plus another entertaining one.I enjoyed the movie and that is all that matters."
53,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,21 August 2014,I liked it!,"I'll be honest. When the movie was first announced I wasn't looking forward to it. When I saw the first official image of Mr. Peabody and Sherman I thought that it looked like another generic movie that was based off an old cartoon show. But, I went and saw the movie anyway. I was pretty surprised by how much I liked this movie. Some friends that went with me to the theater ended up liking the movie. The story and the animation was good. I thought it was funny. I liked the relationship between Peabody and his adoptive son Sherman. I thought the idea of Peabody treating Sherman like his son was better, than him treating Sherman as his pet like in the old cartoon. I'll buy the DVD when it comes out."
54,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,6 August 2014,Pretty amused in deed!,"I've always been a fan of animation movies, when i knew that this amazing cartoon was going to been taken to the big screen i got very excited. To sum up, I totally loved this movie, it has everything that i love from an animation movie, action, comedy and a little bit of drama. This movie makes you love or hate the character from the moment you saw them. I had to say that is a very quick movie, which make it fun to see and not to hard to understand. It has a very unique class a of comedy, very similar to the big bang theory series, making the smart jokes fun even to a kid. My advice for you is to get: a good portion of Pop Corn, a good drink, your family and a good sit because this is a movie you're all going to enjoy!"
55,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,5 August 2014,Clever,"Before I went to watch it, I heard some people go ""Oh it's a clever dog talking, can't be any good, probably will be annoying"". Sorry to disappoint that person, but this is anything but annoying. Actually it is so good, that it reminds me of Pixar. It's very close to their (best) output in a sense, that it does appeal to the young ones, but also has enough for the ""older"" people in the audience.There is a bit of History (Lesson) to be found here, but not with a sledgehammer, rather subtle and part of the story. It doesn't take itself serious and the whole time travel thing would probably not work when put under a microscope. But you won't have time to think about that, because the movie does shift into gear early on and will not let up until the end. Predictable? Maybe. Fun? You bet it is! Unless you hate dogs obviously."
56,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,14 May 2014,Quite good up until the end...then it all became clichéd and lost its way.,"Up until the ending of this film, I enjoyed it immensely. Unfortunately, the ending seemed very formulaic and clichéd and the film ended on a sour note. On balance, however, it's enjoyable but not a film I'd hurry to see.This film is based on the old characters from the ""Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"". However, unlike the old show, giving it movie length was very positive because it allowed the characters to have much greater depth. This is especially so for the relationship between Mr. Peabody and his son, Sherman. I liked how the film showed the difficulties of raising a child and the difficulties a super-genius might have in such an improbably role as a parent. When the film focused on this, it was firing on all cylinders. However, at the end, it really looked like they didn't know how to end the thing and it looked a lot like too many other films (such as ""Back to the Future"", among MANY others) and destroyed the momentum and good will I had towards the film. Not a bad film, but given what the film was early on, it sure lost its direction late in the production and could have been so much better."
57,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,10 May 2014,Exuberant kids film has lots of energy and it's two tons of fun,"A rollicking good time is what you'll have if you check out the latest animated time travel adventure, Mr. Peabody & Sherman 3D. Based on a segment featured in the 1960's cartoon series The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, this flick has about as much energy as five animated ones put together. In fact, the whole running time is fused with a large amount of ADHD. But no need to worry, you'll still embrace the characters, the story which masquerades as being educational, and the blessed, technical skill helmed by director Rob Minkoff (The Lion King, Stuart Little). In other words, this is a kids movie that excels in the computer-animation department. Added to that, I just recently saw it in 3D and that only made the proceedings much more fuller and to a degree, much more richer as well.Featuring the voices of Ty Burrell (TV's Modern Family) and Lesile Mann (This Is 40, Knocked Up), ""Peabody"" is one of those films that doesn't really have a beginning. As things start with some narration by you guessed it, Mr. Peabody (a pint-size dog with glasses), you say to yourself, ""what have I missed"" or ""what has already happened"". The opening shot shows his high-rise mansion in New York City. Then, there is a flashback to his early dog days (ha ha) when he describes himself as a dog who wasn't like other dogs. More intelligent, less catered to the demands of an owner who wants a frisbee retrieved, and not as loving as most pets, Mr. Peabody eventually becomes a genius, a scholar, and an inventor of time travel. He also decides to adopt a son (I know a dog adopting a human being as his child, just go with it) named Sherman (voiced by Max Charles). Together, they go back in time in a sphere-like machine that travels at intense, warp speeds.Of note: I reviewed an animated flick last year with Free Birds. Whereas that November release dealt with getting in a time machine and going back to the first Thanksgiving, this one takes it a step further by having the main characters going back to the Trojan war, back to the actual time when the Mona Lisa was painted by da Vinci, and back to the actual happenings during the French Revolution. And as with most time travel outings, something always has to go wrong with the quote unquote, ""time continuum"". Mr. Peabody and Sherman 3D is no exception. In fact, I have always found most time travel vehicles confusing. It's always hard to follow the elements and have faith that everything comes out correct. If you can get past that minor hiccup in small doses here (along with a silly, clichéd, sort of confusing ending), then you'll be fitfully entertained. ""Peabody"" has a sparkle to it, a pep in its step, and in moderation, it has equal parts adult and kid humor (within the last 20 minutes, look for an unexpected, funny reference to the 1960 classic Spartacus).Ultimately though, I couldn't quite understand the reasoning behind the PG rating. I mean, in my lifetime, I've seen much darker, more intense G fare than this. There is maybe one scene in the first half (a engagement ceremony in Ancient Egypt) that might come off as disturbing. Otherwise, this is an animated exercise that can be viewed by kids of all ages. With swooping camera-work and 3D effects that give you your money's worth, Mr. Peabody & Sherman 3D is pure bliss. The current list of best films from 2014 is short but I assure you, this one is predominantly on it."
58,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,19 March 2014,Better than I expected,"This film was very clever in tying in some old history into modern day times. Sherman in my mind stole the show in that his cute, funny, ignorant character played well off of Mr. Peabody's arrogant, know-it- all, and forever calm character.The filmmakers take you on a fun ride, the only thing I wish was that the film moved a bit more slowly. It was hard to really see much character development in anyone but Sherman...the movie has so much going for it and I almost wish they made the context of this first film into two films.The character that played the top-dog Greek in the Trojan horse, I mean, no doubt you wish you could connect more to him. I feel like you could only get a glimpse at how great each character was and therefore, like I said, I just wish the film told the story slower.Regardless, it is very well animated and thoroughly enjoyable."
59,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,18 March 2014,Great Hearth-warming  Animation,"Rob Minkoff delivers relationship between Humans and Animals again and with the hearth warming of course .The Movie is really fun and entertaining all the time with the adventure , back to the past style with some information about the event in that time too , the characters are also great in the movie they're just so much fun , i mean who doesn't like crazy Leonardo Da Vinci !!The Main characters ( Mr.Peabody , Sherman ) both are great characters with interesting background and conflict they have. I like how the movie question about Love between humans and animal like which one is more important Love to the child ? or just how you look , what you're (a dog for example) and the movie just make it so believable even it's just so Over the top , nonsense.That comes to the part that doesn't work in the movie , they just don't give a reason why Mr. Peabody or ""the dog"" can talk and have so much intelligent which makes the movie doesn't make any sense and unbelievable in some part.Overall still a pretty great movie with great Characters , fun and entertaining to watch and great interesting Theme also ."
60,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,18 March 2014,The Two-Sided Story,"Alright, so let's begin with the negative points, and conclude with the good.It's not entirely clear who the main target audience of this film is. So it's an animation movie, which suggests that it's a kids movie, yet, there are a lot of references and jargon that will simply go over a child's head and leave them confused. A movie like this should have a simple yet meaningful storyline, simple humor and animation which is pleasing to the eye. If an adult enjoys the film, then great. But there shouldn't be attempts made to make the film appeal to adults at the expense of the kids' understanding and enjoyment.The main target audience should be clear from the second the film begins. In this, it felt like two target audiences (the adult and the child) were fighting over control of the movie. In some areas, this caused confusion, and some moments left me thinking 'a child is not going to understand that'. Main example being all the space-time continuum talk.Anyway, let's move onto the good points.This movie is home to some fantastic scenes which are both tear-jerking and gut-wrenching. In fact I would go so far as to say that one of the best animation scenes in history is in this film. That scene is the ""beautiful boy"" montage which succeeds the ""deep regard"" scene. It is a true work of art and is, in my opinion, up there with the rest of the great animation moments. It shows how Peabody came by Sherman, and how the two of them have grown over 7 years. Although Peabody is not able to express his love for his son in words as such, it becomes clear in this scene that his love for Sherman really knows no bounds.The scene on the cliff after Peabody's ""death"" is also significant (definite hint of Lion King), with the conclusion of the movie being very Finding Nemo-Esq. Watching Peabody's reactions to Sherman's ""I'm a dog too"" speech were also brilliant and touching.The emotional scenes convey the Father-Son relationship which should be the focal point of the story. If you look at all the successful animation movies to date, the emotional scenes always have a lot of clout, and are what stick in your mind. If the film had focused more on the relationship, then my opinion of the film (and the rating) would be much higher. The emotional scenes are the meat of this story, but there isn't much more on the skeleton of this movie.In terms of the plot line, it was a bit bumpy. At certain points it would lose its way. I liken it to Harry Potter's first Quidditch match. Started a bit uncontrolled but gradually gaining control (after about 15 minutes), then losing it after the Troy scene (when Harry falls off his broom), then getting back full control in time for a perfect conclusion. So quality wasn't consistent.There isn't much to say on the voice acting except that it was first rate, and the animation..also very pleasing to the eye.In summary, the storyline was a bit bumpy, the target audience isn't clear and the emotional scenes are what made this film good; they made up for the sometimes inconsistent, convoluted storyline.Well worth watching.Thank you for reading."
61,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,17 March 2014,Peabody and Sherman's Excellent Adventure!,"""If a boy can adopt a dog, I see no reason why a dog can not adopt a boy."" As soon as the credits began rolling my little brother looked at me and said ""wow, this was even better than The LEGO movie."" I wouldn't go as far as him, this isn't on the same level, but I was surprised considering I never thought this film would be any good. My expectations for this movie were really low, but as soon as Mr. Peabody and Sherman's excellent adventure through time began I was hooked. It was a fun little history ride as we got to travel with the characters to Ancient Egypt, the Renaissance, the battle of Troy, and the French Revolution. Some of the characters in this film were hilarious (I'm pointing at you Leonardo Da Vinci) and the gags and puns were witty. Mr. Peabody & Sherman is based on the Rocky and Bullwinkle segments from the 50's, ""Peabody's Improbable History,"" and it was directed by Rob Minkoff (who has had more success directing animated films such as The Lion King than live action films like Flypaper and Forbidden Kingdom). This was a very pleasant experience and an animated film children and adults will enjoy alike.The screenplay was adapted by Craig Wright from Jay Ward's short animated series. We are introduced to Mr. Peabody (voiced by Ty Burrell from Modern Family), an advanced canine who happens to be a genius inventor. In order to teach his adopted son, Sherman (Max Charles), history lessons he builds a time machine called WABAC, and travels with him to the past. Together they share thrilling adventures, but the greatest adventure of all turns out to be Sherman's first day in school where he is bullied by a fellow student named Penny Peterson (Ariel Winter). After biting her for calling him a dog, Mr. Peabody is called to school by Ms. Grunion (Allison Janney) who threatens to take his son away from him. In order to make things right, Mr. Peabody invites Penny's parents, Paul (Stephen Colbert) and Patty Peterson (Leslie Mann), to dinner. Sherman gets into trouble again when he shows Penny the time machine and both of them end up in Ancient Egypt causing all sorts of trouble. Mr. Peabody goes to their rescue before Penny's parents discover anything is wrong, which would hurt his chances with Ms. Grunion to maintain his parenting rights.Beside all the fun adventures through time, the film also happens to be a delightful and good hearted movie about father and son relationships. The supporting cast is memorable and Stanley Tucci's Leonardo Da Vinci is the standout. Some of the sweet and tender moments don't work as well as they should and there are also several poop and butt jokes that don't work, but despite those flaws the film manages to stay afloat thanks to some clever and witty jokes and some entertaining and colorful adventures. It's an engaging animated film that works much better than the trailers would lead you to believe. I had a fun time, but by no means is it as witty and engaging as the LEGO movie, but it works just as well."
62,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,11 March 2014,Lovable cartoon with not so extraordinary storyline,"Perhaps 'Mr. Peabody & Sherman' is silly and predictable but somehow it's also unreasonably entertaining and funny. The storyline itself isn't strong and seems had been used from other movies, such as time-travel thing and father-son relationship. The animation is not so special if compared with 'How to Train Your Dragon' or 'The Croods'. Fortunately all of that weakness could be covered by it's two lovable and cute characters. It's just fun to see a genius Mr Peabody paired with Sherman a plain kid who has big curiosity of everything. Rob Minkoff as director also has succeeded to explore the relationship between their two characters into something memorable and put deep messages from it."
63,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,9 March 2014,Not perfect but worth the watch,"I took my 6 year old son and his friend to see this in the theater and all three of us were mostly entertained throughout the entire film. The plot line toward the end unravels a bit and hovers on collapse before it pulls it back together. The best part though is the historical time travel. It was interesting and made me happy that my son and his friend were getting a bit of a history lesson while at the movies on a rainy afternoon. Mr Peabody is completely likable as is his adopted son Sherman. Their relationship is heartwarming and complex given the difference in species and the parental challenges inherent in those differences. Society's reaction to these differences is the driver of the story and the way in which these differences are addressed in the end, although somewhat simplistic, offers a great message to children (and adults) about love and acceptance."
64,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,1,28 August 2017,Deliberate Misogyny - Very Offensive and Shameful,"There is so much sexism in this horrendous stinker of a movie that it has obviously been deliberate. The hateful portrait that was displayed of an early women's advocate, the obvious lack of female historical figures (not a single one in the final scenes), the mean female stereotypes and caricatures, the language that deliberately omits girls and women (all dogs need a boy, all men and dogs are created equal...why not people, or children??) and most disgusting of all, one of the female characters is abducted and nothing is said about it. In fact, the audience is supposed to think this act of violence upon a female character is a good thing. So much for respect for women.I can only wonder what is wrong with the male director and male scriptwriter - their disdain for women and girls seeps through this repulsive little film and watching it with my daughters and my sons, I felt very angry at these men who so wantonly and deliberately tried to attack women and girls - no doubt their core viewers. It sickened me and there is no way I will put this shameful movie on for my children ever again. Misogyny is not a trait I want to promote, unlike those who made this rubbish."
65,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,10,22 August 2015,Most under rated kid's movie!,"We haven't heard about this movie until one day My husband and I took our 6 years old to a emergency dental appointment. This movie was played to distract little ones. We were really butt hurt when we left the dentist's office cause the visit was short for us the finish the whole movie so we watched it from the beginning as soon as we went home, My child even forgot about her bent tooth and swelling lips. The whole family just sank in the couch and finished the whole movie together. It was smart, funny, touching, and very educational. Good way to learn history. and I was very very shocked when I learned that this movie was a box office flop. This is so unfair.There should be more movies like this for children. We strongly hope there will is a Mr.Peabody& Sherman 2!!!"
66,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,28 July 2015,"Very Likable Characters and a Well Structured Plot make this a Winner,","Mr. Peabody & Sherman is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic voice cast. It's a very refreshing animated film, based on a segment from the well known cartoon the Bullwinkle Show, it expands on these stories with beautiful animation and two very lovable leads, Ty Burrell delivers Mr. Peabody's voice brilliantly, adding his own original spin to the character while not shying away from the original too much, and Max Charles voice perfectly conveys a young, shy and optimistic boy. I think the movie needed more adult humour, it has it every now and again, when it does it's fantastic, particularly a Bill Clinton joke that had me in stitches, but for the most part the humour is too kid friendly, there's isn't enough here for the older audience to laugh at that the children won't understand, which is why I'm giving this movie an eight instead of a nine. I'm a sucker for movies that involve time travel, Back to the Future being my favourite film, and that's the biggest thing that appealed to me about this story, I loved the journey these three characters went on and the thing I like most about time travel is that it can be used as a plot device to take your characters anywhere, and they certainly didn't hold back here, many critics complained that the plot was convoluted, but I loved that it was complicated, it didn't try to make the story really simple so kids would understand completely, it just went for an interesting plot. Though it may appeal more to kids, Mr. Peabody & Sherman is still very fun, sweet, with a stellar voice cast, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. After creating a time rift, an intelligent dog and his adopted son must fix the mistakes they have made before it's too late."
67,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,10,14 May 2015,loved watching this movies with my nephews,This movie stands out for its value and quality.I can tell the children love watching this film and Mr Peabody character is so well spoken that the children learn new words just listening to him And the rest of the characters make up a dynamic combination we all enjoyed the representations of the past characters they really bring them back to life.I loved talking with the kids about the history characters and the historical events it's a great movie all around and you'll love it too.10 out of 10 is high but I hour this will encourage a sequel and maybe an educational TV series...Buying the blue ray let's get the ball rolling people. Lol!
68,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,2 May 2015,"Funny, entertaining, creative and smart.","I can barely name any other animated movie which was so entertaining like this one, from the first minute to the last it was a non-stop adventure. It could totally drag me into it's own unimaginable world and i often found myself smiling like a child.The two main character were lovable and funny. Peabody with his inside jokes made some of the conversations even more funnier and Sherman with his harmless and joyful personality added some extra value to the overall experience.Travelling through the centuries was creative and historical events were integrated into the storyline very well. Historical figures were the highlights of the show. My personal favorite was Agamemnon who liked to share some backstories about his fellow army members, but the circumstances of creating the Mona Lisa were also hilarious and smart.Besides being entertaining, the movie is able to come up with some well known historical events and presents them in a humorous way. Talking about historical accuracy is simply unnecessary, happenings and related facts fill out the story perfectly.I could even find a small moral message about being good and obedient all the time. Following the rules is an important part of life but sometimes you need to step out from your comfort zone and do some crazy things to be alive.The animation (at some points) is the the only thing i can mention as a small disadvantage. The characters looked great but some elements and things in the background seemed to suffer from lack of details. This might not have a deep influence but i thought to mention in favor of completeness.This is a perfect example of entertaining kids and adults at the same time, furthermore i think that most of the jokes from the characters and historical figures may only be recognized by older generation.All in all, this is the perfect choice for a family to watch and if there is any chance of this movie getting a sequel i would buy my ticket immediately."
69,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,26 February 2015,It was fantastic,"I had recently been browsing Netflix, and came across this title, I am a fan of very few animated movies, but it was rated 4.5/5 stars so I decided to give it a go. I was amazed, the plot does start off a little slow and boring, but it takes time to introduce the characters and the story based off that plot. Once the story gets going, you get more intrigued at the adventures Mr. Peabody and Sherman go through together, and the lessons and morals throughout the story are great for kids, (as well as adults). it also has some good humor and action sequences both adults and children will enjoy. Overall this is a great movie to see, whichever your age, you will most likely enjoy it."
70,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,26 February 2015,Excellent fun,"I thought this film was terrific, but before I start on this short review a quick comment on one or two of the reviews on this site. Racist, judgemental! What are these people on for Christ sake. It's an enjoyable 90 minute romp made for kids with clean humour, great casting and a terrific story which just flows delightfully. When people come on here with there politically correct attitude to a kids film then it's time to give up and die. Just watch it people this movie is brilliant for kids and adults alike. Ty Burrell is excellent as Mr Peabody and a splendid effort from young Max Charles. The animation is first class and catches each facial expression wonderfully. Take it from me who also loved Spongebob the movie and can't wait to see the new one in March just WATCH IT. End."
71,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,23 February 2015,Not A Bad Adaptation!,"Mr. Peabody and Sherman is the first Dreamworks Animation film of 2014. While it's not the greatest film to come from the studio, it's a decent film that will keep the kids entertained and give them a sweet history lesson. Adults will find the film as a hit and miss kind of film. I liked it mostly as a sweet movie about the bonding of father and son, but the comedy could be better. I did like several of the jokes though. As always, the animation is crisp so that is another plus. Rob Minkoff's film is about a very talented dog named Mr. Peabody who has adopted a boy named Sherman and also invented the time machine. Once they accidentally destroy the space-time continuum, they must go back in time along with Sherman's school bully in order to repair the damage. The film doesn't have a stacked voice cast, but they certainly do well. Ty Burrell as Peabody was good and likewise for Max Charles as Sherman. We do get some supporting voices in the form of Stephen Colbert and the always awesome Stanley Tucci as Leonardo Da Vinci. Overall, Mr. Peabody and Sherman is a good film that I know children will instantly love. Adults may or may not find the film to be amusing. Although some of the jokes are bad, I do like the concept and story of the film. Now a dog adopting a boy is pretty amusing to think about. Thanks to crisp and clear animation and a good story, I did have a solid time watching the film. My Grade: B"
72,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,16 February 2015,Sentimentaly satisfying,"As a huge fan of the Jay Ward studios cartoons of the 60's and 70's, Mr. Peabody has long been a favorite. My favorite moment in every episode was Peobody's pun which ended each episode...""Straights (sic) of Magellan"" indeed! So, I've been looking forward to the movie adaptation since I first heard of it.Its not great, its certainly not what I'd hoped for. Like the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie of a few years ago it suffers for the lack of the writers who scripted for Jay Ward. There's a famous story about Mark Twain's wife ineffectively trying to illustrate what her husband sounded like when he cursed. Applying Twain's response vis ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman,"" the writers understand the mechanics but lack the sensibility.Still, the movie is enjoyable in its own right. The animation is visually exquisite, although in my mind's eye, the original cartoon was more charming for its simplicity. The story is original (although I do recall a Leonardo da Vinci episode of the original series) and the French Revolution/Reign of Terror is pretty dark subject matter for Mr. Peabody. The film takes up the show's concept of the adoption of Sherman by Mr. Peabody and makes good use of it. And best of all, when the movie gets ""manic"" it is able to compensate in the pace of the delivery of its jokes what it lacks in caliber; quantity over quality. For me, the best part of the movie is the voice characterizations, especially Patrick Warburton as Agamemnon; that deep voice makes Agememnon's ridiculous sincerity truly funny. And the other characters are well represented by their respective voice actors.I enjoyed getting a fresh dose of Peabody and Sherman and their hilarious take on historically accurate history. For 90 minutes I got to eat ice cream and laugh just as I did when I was Sherman's age. Sigh..."
73,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,10 February 2015,The story of a dog and his boy - a different kind of modern family,"MR. PEABODY & SHERMAN is a delightful family film with a great message that will appeal to children and their parents. Based on a segment from 1960's cartoon ""Rocky and Friends,"" it tells the story of an extraordinarily smart dog named Mr. Peabody who adopted a boy named Sherman. Aside from being awesome, Mr. Peabody has also invented a time machine which he calls the WABAC (pronounced way-back). Of course, once Sherman finally goes to school (and full of knowledge from all of the first-hand history lessons courtesy of the WABAC) he encounters a bit of trouble, particularly with a mean girl named Penny. Hoping to smooth things over with her parents, he invites Penny and her family over for dinner and that's when the movie really takes off, as Sherman and Penny go on an adventure that has the potential to alter the space-time continuum.The first thing I'll say about this film is that it is very funny. Kids won't get all of the jokes and references, but there is enough humor for the younger people in the audience as well some puns and history-related references that the older people will get. The animation and character design was also very good, and I thought the filmmakers did a fine job in realizing the different time periods that are visited during the film. Complementing it very nicely was a good score by Danny Elfman, although I didn't realize it was him until the closing credits. But most of all, the film has a couple of important messages about family and growing up. As Mr. Peabody is a dog who has adopted a human, it wouldn't take much reaching to draw parallels with recent efforts to redefine what a family can be, be it one with a single parent or one with same-sex parents. Social definitions change, and I thought that the film addressed this in a rather sweet, yet oblique enough, way.There is also the central relationship of Mr. Peabody with Sherman. Despite being a dog, he's not unlike most parents that have reservations about letting their child (or children) go and experience the world for themselves. The way in which Mr. Peabody comes to realize this is a bit convoluted and long-winded, but the end result is rather touching. My only real complaint with the film is one that I have with a lot of films, and that is the third act gets a little too crazy, even for a story involving time travel, yet gets resolved rather neatly. Of course, if characters in movies were half as smart as the audience, then maybe there wouldn't be as much of a story. Still, I enjoyed this very much for its humor and message. It's a great family film that kids and adults can enjoy together."
74,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,5 December 2014,Good clean fun and with heart,"Mr. Peabody is a genius and (oh yes) a dog. His brilliance always got into the way of him being adopted. He discovers baby Sherman in an alley and adopts him. Sherman inspires him to invent the WABAC time machine. At school, Sherman is bullied by Penny Peterson teasing him that he's a dog. Sherman invites the Petersons to a dinner. Sherman disobeys Mr. Peabody and takes Penny on the WABAC. Mr. Peabody and Sherman must go back to ancient Egypt to rescue Penny.This is a good clean children's movie. The jokes are mostly puns delivered by Mr. Peabody and Sherman saying ""I don't get it."" It does well in the way of most modern animations. I like the light touch and the round smooth faces. It gives it an easy comfortable innocent feel. On top of the well-made animation, there is a real heart. That puts it as one of the better kids' movies. The adoption storyline is really touching and compelling."
75,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,30 November 2014,"Not perfect, but pretty good","This movie was not exactly great, but it was a pretty good movie. The reason it wasn't exactly great was because it was actually pretty short and there's less adventure than I thought there would be. I would of seen this in a theater if I could, but I saw this On Demand instead. I would say this movie is like Cloudy with a chance of meatballs combined with the Lego movie. Even though it was short for me, this would probably be a movie you won't get bored watching. One thing I like about this film is that in the movie, Mr. Peabody is a really intelegent dog, and it makes him look funny. Overall, this is a pretty good film. I rate this 7/10, which means the movie was pretty good."
76,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,8 November 2014,Fun for the kids,"It isn't a perfect movie. I actually preferred the original cartoon a lot more. I don't think the love interest was a good idea. The antagonist is also worthless and misplaced. Several references in the movie in relation to history were taken with creative license. I also don't like the ending. It's very weak and lacking in great content. It is almost like they rushed very thing and just wanted to get the movie over.The kids loved the movie though and I enjoyed the animation and the little one liners. The little sight gags are also very funny and the hidden references to various historical figures, sayings, events are fun to find for adults.8/10 and we will be getting it for the kids as an addition to our Amazon library."
77,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,28 October 2014,"""I'm a dog too!""","Once again I am not disappointed with the work of DreamWorks. Year after year they put out great animated material that sure, at times is second to a certain mouse, but they also have their own taste to them. And although Mr. Peabody and Sherman feels a lot like How to Train Your Dragon, it's quite a fun ride.I was skeptical about the film partially due to the trailers being underwhelming and the critics not being overly fond of the film either. But when it comes down to it, the film is full of silly characters but is also full of great lessons. I really enjoyed the relationship between Sherman and Mr. Peabody. Even throwing Penny into the mix formed a cute trio of leads. Add in time travel and you have yourself a well rounded film. I think there a few problems but I think the film also deserves more credit for just being fun and not trying to do too much. Like I said it shares a lot, and I mean a lot of the same plot points as Dragon, but it also starts it's own universe without a problem.Just as I enjoyed watching Midnight In Paris solely for the throwback characters, I think seeing some of the most famous, and intelligent, people of all time on one screen was pretty cool. Now doing that the film did get a bit convoluted and couldn't pull as many of the heartstrings as other DreamWorks films could, it's an adventurous ride throughout. You will know exactly where the film is going from the get-go but the story doesn't seem old or rehashed in any way. Like I said, it's just fun. Take the film for what it is and I think you will enjoy it.+Adventurous ride +Who doesn't love time travel +FUN +Builds a cool universe -Predictable -Could have been a little bit more different than Dragon 8.0/10"
78,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,10,20 October 2014,Really awesome film,"First of all, this was the only animated film this year that looked completely great from the 2014 trailers. And, my God!, was the movie a masterpiece. Many have said the movie's plot is convoluted by trying to shove in too many famous people from history, but the amount of historical characters while large are spread it out and each character serves a purpose in the plot. Dreamworks animation, as you would expect, is perfect. The character designs are creative and not to the point were it looks too real. It looks very cartoon and it really works in the wacky world they're creating; the background is even better - giving out something very colorful with loads of details. The characters are Dreamworks best collection since Bee Movie and/or The Prince of Egypt; all of them are well developed and written. They work perfectly together. They only word the can describe Mr. Peabody and Sherman is perfection. I have never been more pleased with an animated film meeting my expectations since Rise of The Guardians (another Dreamworks masterpiece.) So keep up your perfect work Dreamworks!!! and go watch this film right now!"
79,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,7 September 2014,History and time travel with Dreamworks and with irreverent effect,"Mr Peabody and Sherman may not be among Dreamworks' best(The Prince of Egypt, How to Train Your Dragon and Shrek) or the best animated film of the year so far(between The Lego Movie and How to Train Your Dragon 2), but in my opinion it was a very good film with plenty going for it. The third act does get convoluted and too hectic, there are a few anachronisms that are quite jarring(especially with the Leonardo DaVinci referred to in a previous review) and some of the historical references might go over children's heads(for example they are unlikely to have heard of Robespierre), but actually Mr Peabody and Sherman doesn't have much that wrong with it.The animation is great; the colours are beautifully textured and rich, the backgrounds are smooth and detailed in alternative to blocky(the landscapes are beautifully rendered) and while the ""over-sized heads"" may take some getting used to the character designs are likable and don't move in a robotic way at all. Danny Elfman's music is energetic and rousing, while it's not one of his best works(ie. Edward Scissorhands) it is one of his better recent efforts. There's always room as well for Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon and George Gershwin. The script is very witty and smart with some very inspired puns that both children and adults will love. Especially funny were the plagues and Oedipus jokes. The story is cleverly structured and fast-moving, it is a tad predictable in places and as said the third act gets convoluted but on the most part it does a great(and fresh) job with the time travel idea(after seeing the mediocre at best Free Birds waste it).And I for one loved the historical references, there's a lot of them(for example George Washington, Ancient Egypt, the French Revolution with Marie Antoinette and Robespierre, the Trojan War with Agamemnon and the Italian Renaissance with Mona Lisa and Leonardo DaVinci) and they are sent up remarkably cleverly. Sure the referenced characters are caricatures- but to be honest that wasn't unexpected, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of the best examples of time travelling in films and the referenced characters were caricatures in that too- and some might find them stereotypical but they were really fun to spot and delightful in their own right. The references may go over the heads of some but actually it is a good way of getting acquainted with the characters and eras and may inspire to learn more about it. By all means though you still learn a good deal here, Marie Antoinette and George Washington were interesting.Underneath all the irreverence though Mr Peabody and Sherman also has a lot of heart, the whole adoptive father/son bonding, the story of how Sherman came to be adopted and the ending were very heartfelt. The titular characters are very endearing and the film does wonderfully in making their somewhat unlikely relationship believable, one of its strengths. Didn't mind Penny personally, she was bratty to begin with but she grows on you. The voice cast are first-rate, particularly Ty Burrell who is brilliantly funny yet with the ability to bring emotional depth to the character, and if Max Charles continues to act he has a promising future ahead of him. Of the rest of the cast the standouts were Allison Janney who is deliciously wicked, Stanley Tucci who brings warm eccentric colour to Leonardo DaVinci and especially Patrick Warburton who is a hoot as Agamemnon. To conclude, a very good animated film. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
80,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,26 August 2014,Time Traveling Antics a Hit!,"Every dog deserves a human - who will get in troublesome funny historical adventures while traveling through time.Mr. Peabody & Sherman has everything you want from a wonderful family animation: laughs and lessons.I never watched the 1960's show that originally featured the characters now headlining their own movie. I can't speak as to whether the Mr. Peabody & Sherman characters in this film are representative of and retain their authentic characters' likenesses.Mr. Peabody is a dog. He is also smart, like genius smart, and an inventor. In addition to coming up with many things like Zumba, he's invented a time-traveling machine called the WABAC. His son Sherman is a human, it's an adoptive relationship, and is just starting school. When he gets in trouble for getting into a fight with a girl Penny, Mr. Peabody invites Penny and her family over for dinner to mitigate the issue. Sherman accidentally mentions the WABAC to Penny and she just has to see it to believe it. Mr. Peabody works frantically to save the children and right the ensuing time-traveling troubles.While flying around wormholes in the WABAC audiences will experience ancient Egypt, the Italian Renaissance, ancient Troy, and the French Revolution but will meet even more historical characters. Parents should take the time to use this as a learning tool because this film is not meant to be educational in the historical sense - it's an animated film, would you really expect it to? All figures are satirized caricatures and Dreamworks gets a bunch of easy laughs at their expense. Parents will get laughs too because with most good animated movies there are smarter jokes hidden within the dialogue.I could not stop myself from laughing while watching this film. There was a ton of pop culture crammed into the plot in addition to history which kept it fun, light and enjoyable. Sherman was just the right amount of funny kid. Mr. Peabody was charming and Ty Burrell could not be more perfect to voice the caring father but intellectual juggernaut.The film kept me completely engaged the entire time and I was surprised at just how smart the film felt. I've already watched it twice and will definitely watch it again.More film and television reviews are at our website, check it out!"
81,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,12 August 2014,Mr Peabody & Sherman,"These characters are based on the wholly American cartoon show 'The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show', a cartoon that has never really been shown that much within the UK (I believe). In all honesty I can understand why because even though I'm not entirely knowledgeable on the series I have seen it here and there...and it wasn't very good really. The main reasons being the cartoon is pretty old and dated both culturally and visually, the animation has that sparse Hanna-Barbera look which I never really liked that much and the main characters just don't really appeal, but that's just me.As for Mr. Peabody and Sherman I haven't really seen much of these characters at all, I don't recall them in any way, ditto Dudley Do- Right. So I went into this film not really knowing what to expect other than the fact it was a kids flick and it looked colourful. Seeing as these two characters adventures revolved around time travel originally its no surprise that this movie goes down the same route...duh! So naturally we are sent on a head spinning trek across time and space...albeit a pretty convoluted trek.Yes the whole time travel idea is a tad mundane these days, you can only do so much really and we've seen it many times before. Many of the usual locations turn up such as Egypt, Ancient Greece (probably down to recent popularity with the 300 movies) and a few European countries. Most of the famous historical figures the duo meet are the regular bunch we always tend to see in time travel movies...George Washington, Abe Lincoln and Albert Einstein *yawn*. Despite all the predictable unoriginal cookie cutter themes and the story being quite messy I actually really enjoyed it, in fact the convoluted plot made the film more enjoyable I think, more zany, more interesting and in places a little intense.I find it funny that the entire adventure happens mainly because Sherman gets bullied by a little girl in his class. Gotta remind myself I'm watching a kids movie all the time, like the whole idea that a dog can adopt a human child! even in a cartoon world that seems kinda odd. Yes Mr. Peabody is a super intelligent dog and ranks above many humans but he's still an animal, just feels strange, on top of that why does he insist on Sherman calling him Mr. Peabody? That relationship throughout the film felt strained to me, I couldn't feel any emotion between them and it reflected on me connecting with them both. Sherman does indeed feel more like a pet to Peabody even thought they both connect on a more loving parental level in the end. Am I looking into this too much?There are some lovely CGI visuals that are bright bold and highly colourful. Ancient Italy especially looks super lovely where as the Trojan horse sequence not only looks good but is very amusing thanks to the ever hilarious Patrick Warburton and his perfect vocals. Seriously was that guy born for animated voice acting or what! Unsurprisingly all the sequences set back in time look really good and very slick, once we reach the present day things get less eye catching naturally, we all know what the present day looks like huh.All in all I can't deny it does feel a little formulaic with the nonsensical science tomfoolery and jargon thrown at you from every angle, the kind of flashy pretty looking and hi-tech sounding stuff that looks and sounds good on screen but no one really knows what they're on about. We see this often in kids fantasy flicks. I still don't quite get why the vortex at the end starts spitting out various random famous historical landmarks and monuments and then when its reversed it sucks them all back up conveniently...don't question it, don't question the space-time continuum rip thingy. Anyway the movie is a hoot all the way through with, I think, some good quirky eye candy, fun sight gags and fun verbal.7/10"
82,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,16 February 2014,A Barking Brilliant Movie!,"Mr Peabody and Sherman, (what a title)is the new animated comedy from DreamWorks, (the makers behind box-office smashes such as Shrek and Madagascar). It centres around a boy called Sherman, (who was found abandoned in a cardboard box as a baby by an extremely brainy dog called Mr Peabody) and his adoptive father, Mr Peabody. Mr Peabody invents a machine which enables them to travel back to any point in history, which becomes the explanation for Sherman's widely-spanned historic knowledge. When Sherman is insulted at school by a girl called Penny, (she offends him by calling him a dog) and bites her in retaliation, she and her parents have to visit his house to check if Mr Peabody is a suitable parent.I was looking forward to watching this movie, though I was rather con fuddled at the title, and I wasn't disappointed at all. This is a colourful, quirky and humorous movie. The characters are likable, the pacing is steady, the story is fresh and unpredictable and there are enough jokes to raise a few laughs from adults and children alike.I must admit, this wasn't the best movie I have seen, but neither was it the worst. Certainly, its target audience is infants, but adults will definitely smile and laugh along to the childish behaviour of the characters, as well as learn a thing or too about history.All in all, I recommend this film to families, as the humour included in the movie is enjoyable for both the children and the parents, and it is quite educational for history."
83,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,21 February 2014,He'd give Einstein a run for his money...,"In my day, dogs would fetch sticks and wee on fire hydrants. They most certainly did NOT adopt little boys and take them on magical time travel adventures. Just what are they putting in Pedigree Chum these days? Anyway, Mr Peabody is a canine genius. He can talk, solve complicated mathematical equations and has even won gold medals at the Olympics. Why no-one is shocked when they meet the only animal capable of all these feats is beyond the pale; he is what he is.But of all his accomplishments, being a father is his proudest achievement (BLESS!). And his little boy is starting his first day at school! Unfortunately, a girl decides to pick on the kid purely down to jealousy... and his son retaliates by biting. In the midst of trying to prove he's not teaching the child bad habits and convince the social services not to take his adoptee away, Peabody, his kid and his female aggressor get stuck going through the epochs in his time machine.... in circumstances too complicated to go into here. Much lampooning of historical figures, toilet humour and father-son bonding commences.Based on some old 60's cartoons no-one here in the UK remembers (apart from a brief reference on a Simpsons Treehouse Of Horror special) Mr Peabody & Sherman is an enormously fun frolic through the ages, which moves forward at a lickety split pace but leaves ample room for character development and scenes that'll make you go 'aaahhh!' Considering Peabody is so desperate to avoid time paradoxes throughout, it seems rather odd that he'd allow the likes of Tutankhamun and Leonardo Da Vinci to take modern technology with them at the end... surely if anything was going to mess up the timeline, it's that. And the bit where it looks like our doggy genius might be put to sleep for nipping a woman under extreme provocation is not only upsetting, it also seems highly unlikely that they'd allow such a unique creature such a fate.Nitpicks, nitpicks. This is a very good family film, with jokes for all ages and a very moving familial relationship at it's core. In fact, I'm somewhat envious... perhaps Peabody could take me on too. Just send me the papers... 7/10"
84,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,2,4 May 2014,Why can't kids be kids?,"I really was excited to take my kids to see this movie. As we watched it, there was a ton of innuendo. It was kind of annoying. We just wanted to watch an innocent family movie, but almost every scene was breasts, drinking, and /or some rude joke. I was really disappointed that the parental guides for most of the websites I checked never mentioned most of the inappropriate content in this movie. I don't understand why movie makers have to push such garbage on kids, I believe this is one of the reasons why children have so many issues now days, they're not allowed to be children. It is also disappointing how they can take something innocent and completely ruin it. I believe those who watched Mr. Peabody and Sherman as children wanted to see the movie because they thought it might be nostalgic for them, but instead it was just weird and inappropriate."
85,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,9 June 2014,The dog is smart.,"The dog is smart. He is also full of heartfelt love for his human son, the beautiful boy. The dog is a genius, but the son is sort of slow to catch on to a lot of things. Still, the canine father has patience and understanding. The animators did a good job of showing the love on the dog father's face. Sherman is goofy, with big feet. I think he is clumsy, but I am not sure if I saw that in the scenes or not. The color is very good. The animation is excellent. The children services woman is very obnoxious and scary. How dare she say that Mr. Peabody is a bad father? The girl is just a troublemaker, but gets away with blaming Sherman for starting the fight. Later on, when Mr. Peabody has tried to placate the girl's parents with a deluxe home-cooked gourmet dinner (Mr. Peabody is also a celebrity chef?), he has to chase the girl (forget her name) and Sherman to the ends of the time and space universe (I think, but it is fuzzy) in order to retrieve the Wayback Machine and save the children from some frightful calamities.Later, the girl becomes friends with Sherman, and of course just adores Mr. Peabody. She is saved from a doomed marriage with a young King Tut. She wants all the jewels and luxurious royal robes, but she does not want an instant widow's death. Boo and hiss. Tut was a cutie, though. As far as the Egyptian drawing of human innards being dug out for mummification purposes, relax. It was just a cartoon. Don't get yourself all rumpled up. Did a reviewer say that this was bad for child viewers? I think that it would be over their heads. It went so fast that even I had to blink, in order to catch the drawing moving so fast. It was educational, however, IMO.Un-warped history: No, Marie Antoinette never said, ""Let them eat cake."" Marie was a caring person. France had high bread prices because of several previous extremely cold winters, and the ensuing wheat crops were small by normal standards. People (not the nobles) were broke. Prices shot up. People could hardly afford bread, much less cake. France had spent mightily to help in the American Revolution. People could not pay their taxes. These issues led to the French Revolution. Not just Marie was decapitated, but the first royal to go under Madame Guillotine was King Louis XVI, her husband. This movie left that out. Louis was the main royal, on whose shoulders the French Revolution rested. Marie was compassionate in real life, and not mean and nasty. Lots of nobles were also guillotined, plus some priests. Religion also was damaged during the French Revolution. See more about Marie in the 1938-1939 ""Marie Antoinette"" movie, starring Norma Shearer. She was from Austria, and the French people always tried to hate her and make up lies about her. I think that this cake-thing was dreamed up by her enemies and other anti-royalists.Good movie, but the Marie part was wrong. This gives moviegoers a bad impression. I have studied the French Revolution at university, and the Marie-cake thing is always discussed. I also have a History Degree.Da Vinci: The girl and Sherman even become friends with Leonardo. Leonardo did invent the helicopter, plus made plans for a fixed-wing flying machine. He was also an artist, as depicted in the Mona Lisa. He was quite the designer, and had several other inventions. He was known as a super-genius: an Italian Renaissance Polymath. He was also depicted in the movie ""Ever After"", where he designs a set of glittery gossamer wings for his friend Danielle (Drew Barrymore) 'Cinderella' to wear at the ball. Re: Leonardo: I have studied him in the History of Aviation, regarding the helicopter. I have also studied Fine Arts, and Leonardo is well regarded in that field. Leonardo also painted other works, including ""The Last Supper"" and ""The Annunciation."""
86,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,19 March 2014,Needed more bite.,"Peabody and Sherman were usually a highlight on the Rocky and Bullwinkle show. They would go to an interesting time or event in history and show how it effected the world and end it all with a pun.The feature seems forced and a bit like ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"". There are not enough puns and many of the best jokes went over the head of the children in the audience. Spartacus and Bill Clinton got a laugh from the adults.It is bright and moves at a good pace but it is not in the same ball park as.""Frozen"" or the other recent animated features. Looking for a movie for the whole family, lower your expectations and check it out."
87,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,30 December 2017,Fulfilling funtime,"Watched this last night, wasn't expecting much but to my surprise it catches your attention after sometime with it's great adventures of time travelling and little bumps of comedy. Have complete set of emotional values that every Father and Son should have. 
A good family time movie, worth your time and also gives you some history lessons that's keep you interested."
88,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,10,27 December 2017,An unexpected great!,"Mr. Peabody, a highly intelligent dog and very different from all his kind, becomes the first to adopt a human being. Together with his son, they use the secret time machine to travel into the past and explore all the corners of history. Everything goes normal until Sherman goes to school and has a fight with one of his colleagues. This event triggers an unexpected visit from child care which are determined to take Sherman away, but Peabody is determined to change their mind. He organizes a special dinner with the child's parents and the representative from child care but his plans are soon to be altered by Sherman's ego who will ultimately put the stability of the time continuum into peril.Although it begins atypical, this movie presents an interesting story featuring a dog who can do practically anything and his attempts to maintain the course of time flowing in the right direction after his son and the latter's colleague travel back unattended and without permission. It is very impressive with the dog's abilities and the animated special effects which provide a special aura to the atmosphere.Its story is interesting and although not groundbreaking, it manages to keep your attention throughout the whole picture. Despite the fact that Sherman is quite a troublemaker, mainly due to his friend, he plays an important role in the movie's intrigue and slowly starts to mature in order to impress his father. This movie came as a pleasant surprise for me as I wasn't expecting such a quality animation from this title but it proved me wrong and I enjoyed every single part of it."
89,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,17 September 2017,Fun adventure with time travel jeopardy,"First part of the movie i would give 12 out of 10 points. Really fun adventure film, not only for kids. Since the dog hypnotized girls parents, i waited to see also how they arrive back, but what never happened. For me from this part when they left Mr. Peabody in old Creece, it went kind of messy, off-road rally (like lots of weird cartoons). From this part i would give 2 out of 10. So, median score i get than 7."
90,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,10,10 September 2017,Nice,This movie is so fun.I highly recommend watching it. funny and entertaining. Kids love it. Adults love it.Everybody loves it. the story of the movie is amazing as well. Adventure roller coaster of a movie. Good screen play. This film has some of the finest voice actings I have ever heard in an animated feature
91,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,10,24 August 2017,Beter than expected!,"When i saw the trailer i thought that it won't be so good, c'mon a dog adopting a child etc. In the beginning i got a little irritated by Peabody's look, But it was alright. The movie was awesome from the beginning till the end. I can't believe what people are saying about this. But for me it was an awesome movie. A DON'T MISS INDEED"
92,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,7 August 2017,A funny and clever adaptation of the '60s cartoon.,"Out of all the cartoons that aired on television in the 1960's, the best one by far was probably ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"". While the animation was cheap (as most shows were back in the day), it's was great featuring some funny laughs and memorable characters that will be remembered for years to come. They were also many other segments during the show with the most famous being one involving a intelligent canine named Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman who go through many various places in time thanks to Peabody's latest invention, the WABAC. Flash forward fifty years later, and the duo have now appeared for the first time on the big screen thanks to the help through DreamWorks Animation and ""Lion King"" director Rob Minkoff, and I can happily say that I was satisfied with the results they brought. ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" has the same charm and clever humor that the show had while adding the right amount of heart leading to a very enjoyable movie.For the past years, the gifted Mr. Peabody (Ty Burell) has been tutoring his adopted son Sherman (Max Charles) on history while using a time machine called the WABAC. They have gone through many different places at different times, like the French Revolution or the days of Van Gogh, the list goes on. Having travelled thru time for many years, Sherman has become a very educated student in history which angers a jealous girl named Penny (Ariel Winter) leading to a fight that ends in the principals office. Worried that Sherman might get taken away by an angry Child Protectives Services agent (Allison Janney), Peabody sets out to make peace between the two kids hoping they can reconcile. However, Sherman's only way of impressing the girl is the time machine, which results in her getting lost in Ancient Egypt. After warning Peabody about the incident, Sherman and him go off on a crazy time adventure to try get Penny home.While many other time travel movies have basically outdone flaws that were present in the show (""Back to the Future"" is a notable example), the story still feels rather faithful and funny. One notable addition was a new backstory involved with Peabody finding Sherman which I liked better than the cartoon as I thought it lead to the movie having some good heart to it. The story,however, isn't without its flaws. While I heavily enjoyed the bits involving the time travel, the subplot about Sherman being taken away was very unnecessary. It felt very forced into the story and even to the worst part of the movie which, without spoiling, involves one of the characters defending the other.  The animation was pretty good. While it does have some awkward moments involving characters drawn specifically in a 2D format being turned into computer models, I thought the environments created felt faithful. The colors also popped out of the screen which I always love to see in DreamWorks' movies. The characters are also pretty fun. I particularly enjoyed the father-son relationship of Peabody and Sherman. I thought it was handled perfectly which lead to some good emotional moments. The new characters might turn people off though. While I thought Penny was a nice addition and thought she had a good chemistry with Sherman, I did not like the CPS agent. She was a perfect example of a one-dimensional character as the only emotion I got from her was anger. That's it. It was frustrating to see no other emotions coming from her. However, it's really a nitpick.""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" was a very fun movie.  I thought that, despite it's problems, it had a fun story, some good animation, and some really funny characters. While children might get confused by the movie at parts, I think that the film will entertain them. I certainly was entertained, and I think that's worth the price of admission."
93,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,27 February 2017,Uninspired but Decent,"Sweetness and good-natured humor seep from the pores of Mr. Peabody & Sherman, an animated adventure film based on the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" shorts. While not as inventive as 2014's Lego Movie, Minkoff and company managed to bring the 1950s cartoon into the 21st century without completely abandoning the fun self-awareness of the original. A mixture of Indiana-Jones-style adventure, fast pacing and an onslaught of dog puns make this a decent, if somewhat uninspired, outing. It's the story of a genius dog and his human son who travel through time and space learning history and causing havoc along the way. As with most time travel stories, the stakes are high but the peril never quite connects. There are some sloppy moments and missed opportunities especially in the time travel elements. When you have all of time and space at your fingertips, you shouldn't squander that opportunity. However, the focus is clearly on the innocent humor, great action and father-son relationship. Burrell nails it as the witty dog-dad, describing the science of everything and keeping it light, all while saving the day. The set pieces are stunning, recalling the under-appreciated Adventures of Tintin in their exuberance. In addition, its study of parent/child relationships is touching and attentive. Sure, Dreamworks is still trying to be a bit too hip, forcing time-sensitive one-liners and unneeded innuendos when simple and tight storytelling would suffice. Yet while it's far from groundbreaking or completely successful, it still manages to be much better than most of the wasted garbage that's been dumped on the theatres this year."
94,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,3 January 2017,The Shermanator.,"Taking a look at the TV listings of ""family"" films getting shown,I was intrigued to find that along with the major blockbusters,that more overlooked animated titles were being shown. Only knowing the title previously from spoofs on Family Guy,I felt it was time to meet the real Mr. Peabody & Sherman.The plot:Since going to court to get the right for a dog to adopt a human boy (!)Mr. Peabody uses a time machine to travel across all historical eras with his son Sherman. Getting in a fight with Penny,Sherman runs the risk of being expelled from school. Wanting fix things,Peabody invites Penny and her parents round for dinner. Mending things with her family,Peabody pushes Sherman to find ways to fix things with Penny. Struggling to find something in common,Sherman breaks Peabody's rule,and gives Penny a time machine tour.View on the film:Rolling out with a loose history lesson,the screenplay by Craig Wright/ Robert Ben Garant/Thomas Lennon & Michael McCullers bends lively Sci-Fi with quirky Comedy,as the square pegs of Peabody and Sherman are delightfully placed in historical events that have a surprisingly risqué chop (including a guillotine!) Sprinkling Penny and her family into the time fold,the writers deliver a kind note on family bond that skips becoming sickly sweet thanks to dry wit humour and an energetic time travel adventure which allows Peabody to cross watches with Washington and Antoinette.Witnessing some of the biggest events in history,director Rob Minkoff gives the movie a zany shine,lit by crisp blues and dusty yellows taking Peabody and Sherman across Egypt and deep into the criss-crossing time tunnels. Retaining their original design, Minkoff gives each of the characters distinctive rough edges,that emphasis the off-beat comedy exchanges in Peabody and Sherman's time keeping."
95,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,10 September 2016,Great movie for all ages,"I think this one went under the radar a little with all the other animated movies that have come out, but this has great jokes, it's educational to everyone, and has jokes for both children and adults thrown in.This is a funny movie for all ages and I would def recommend if you want to watch a movie your children would like but don't want to be bored yourself. I wondered why this movie isn't more highly rated on IMDb, and saw one reviewer calling Mr Peabody a 'narcissistic megalomaniac' hahaha, no... no he isn't, it's a cartoon, and a comedy... but essentially i get it, it's not as good as the cartoon you watched when you were younger... oh and the same reviewer thought that the romans were in the Trojan horse, ahem."
96,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,7 September 2016,Mr. Peabody & Sherman Review,"Mr. Peabody & Sherman (2014) Starring: Ty Burrel, Max Charles, Ariel Winters, Allison Janney, Ellie Kemper, Stephen Colbert, Stephen Tobolowsky, Karan Brar, Joshua Rush, Adam Alexi-Malle, Stanley Tucci, Leslie Mann, and Lake Bell Directed by Rob Minkoff Review HE'S LEAVING HIS MARK ON HISTORY You know I'm beginning to believe that Dreamworks is getting better with their animated feature films, I've heard great things about their How to Train Your Dragon movies, which I have not seen and this film in particular was surprisingly not just good but great. The Film revolves around Sherman who bites a girl named Penny, after she calls him a dog. His father a dog named Mr. Peabody decides to clear this up by having Penny and her parents come over for dinner. Penny doesn't believe Sherman when he tells her about meeting George Washington, so he shows her The Wayback which is a time machine and she becomes engaged to king Tut. Mr. Peabody and Sherman attempt to get Penny out but they stop along the way when the wayback runs out of battery and must return home to stop the portal bringing everyone from the past to the present. The film is based on Mr. Peabody & Sherman comic,cartoon or whatever it originally was where they had adventures through time and history. It's quite interesting and packs a wonderful family punch and the kids would probably love this as well the adults. You can bet this movie is a lot of fun, it excels in animation and fast pacing that when there traveling in the wayback or in a situation it's like a jolt of excitement. You can say that this is one of the best animated films of the year. The performances are amazing, I don't all the voice actors but Ty Burrel who voices Sherman was excellent and while I don't know who voiced Penny and Mr. Peabody I dound them too be great as well. All the elements of a good animated kid's film are not present it lacks that gut feeling you have for the characters, but the gut feeling of them surviving a situation is there from the problems occurrence to the resolve. I give Mr. Peabody & Sherman a four out of five."
97,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,10,30 July 2016,Absolutely The Funniest I've Seen in Years!,"To begin with, I was a big fan of Mr. Peabody and Sherman as a child in the 60s and was skeptical about an updated remake and avoided it at the theaters. Usually updated stories from years gone by get ruined by making them current. But I had a chance to see it and was glad I did. I laughed out loud more during this movie than I had in any movie in a long, long time. There's humor for every generation from Baby Boomer to Millennial. I wasn't prepared for how actually intelligent it is. Possible spoiler: There are many little touches that Boomers will recognize and appreciate and laugh at in recognition (""Hey, I'm walking here!"", ""I'm Spartacus!"" etc), and stick around for the very last few frames for a true 'Fractured Fairy Tales"" touch. The wit is sharp and humor is surprisingly stronger than the original cartoons. And the music is pretty good, too."
98,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,22 May 2016,an adventure in ancient times,"Mr. Peabody & Sherman is an animation that I was not even excited to watch more then I saw go on TV and decided to watch , and it surprised me , I quite liked the animation is fun and interesting , has funny moments , such as in Troy war , the characters Peabody and Sherman are good fun , the soundtrack is good , the script has some problems , plus it's interesting, the pace of the film is good , since the film does not get to be longer, before using the machine time can be a little slow, the voice work is very good, the actors combined with their characters, some moments are costs as in ancient Egypt , more Mr. Peabody & Sherman is a really fun animation with great moments, a good soundtrack and scenes to get a few laughs . Note 7.7"
99,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,26 March 2016,Why Are Film Adaptations Of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show Commercial Duds?,"Mr. Peabody and Sherman are two characters from the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. The show was a modest hit, and lasted from 1959 to 1964. So many years after the show's cancellation, people went on to make films based on the series. These are Boris and Natasha (1992), Dudley Do- Right (1999), The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (2000), and then Mr. Peabody and Sherman (2014). Sadly, none of these films were successful in the box office. And although Mr. Peabody and Sherman made more money than its budget, the film still created losses for the filmmakers. It's kinda hard to believe how a TV series can become successful but its film adaptations don't do so well in theaters. Perhaps ever since the show got cancelled in 1964, things about it pretty much disappeared from people's minds. And perhaps reception of the show would have a been a lot better had the studio people picked a boy to be that flying grey critter."
100,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,12 February 2016,Funny and you can learn something.,It's super adorable and entertaining. It's like a mini fun history lesson all in one beautifully animated package. Children and adults alike can both learn something while also having a few laughs. The characters all have brilliant attitude and personality and it's a sweet take on some of history's most noted characters.It had a nice mix of innocent and somewhat crude humour. Penny is such a troublemaker and such a bad influence on poor little Sherman but she keeps it interesting.It was certainly better than I was expecting. All ages can enjoy it and will take something from it.
101,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,16 October 2015,DreamWorks' Best Movie So Far,"First of all, I have never seen the original 1960's Mr. Peabody & Sherman and probably never will. However, I do appreciate DreamWorks' effort for bringing a piece of the past to modern day.For what it is, Mr. Peabody & Sherman is a good movie. A little slow in the beginning, but it will pick up speed.However, there are a few problems that I felt ruined the movie.1. For a boy raised by an intellectual dog (who I might add, invented a well working time machine) Sherman seems very ""uninformed"" despite having first-hand experiences with history. Often times, he does not understand Mr. Peabody's jokes, as obvious as they may seem, resulting in the ""ha ha ha, I don't get it"" gag, and it will happen a couple times. To the kids, it may grab a giggle or chuckle, but it will not make anyone laugh. Instead, I felt it ""slowed down"" the movie every time it was used. It just does not fit the tone they were trying to establish.2. The idea of not altering the past is not very prevalent in the movie. First off, THEY DO CARE (or rather, Mr. Peabody does) about not going to a time they are present in, such as yesterday or an hour ago, for example, so as to not rip a hole in the space-time continuum. However, they do not carry the same mindset into the past. For example, the WABAC (the time machine) was running short of energy, so Mr. Peabody had to recalculate the current directions. He decided to stop by Florence, Italy (renaissance age) and seek help from Leonardo da Vinci (after Penny, the girl responsible for the whole plot, walked in on da Vinci during the painting of Mona Lisa). From there, we learn that Mr. Peabody and da Vinci are actually friends. The movie implies that Mr. Peabody had gone back before and befriended da Vinci. Shouldn't that alter the time line by just a little bit! Oh, and the ending also completely ruins the ""do not alter the past"" logic.Still, I liked the idea for the movie and found it enjoyable. It is teaching the kids, while being entertaining. It's brilliant! Of course, for every animated film these days, one cannot simply pass by without a strong pathos. The pathos effect of Mr. Peabody & Sherman is good, albeit cliché. The ""bad parent-offspring relationship reconciled at the end"" is very overdone in animated movies (ahem, Pixar) however, this one felt ""different."" I cannot explain why, but it just felt so good in the end. So corny, but very emotional; it had me tearing.Overall, it is a good movie. Nothing more, nothing less."
102,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,5,14 October 2015,Mr. Peabody and Sherman,"This movie is about a dog, Mr. Peabody, and his boy, Sherman. Mr. Peabody adopted Sherman. Mr. Peabody is very smart and invited a time machine. Him and Sherman use this time machine, or ""The Way Back,"" to visit the past and all the famous people of the past. Mr. Peabody and Sherman are friends with famous figures such as George Washington, Muhammad, Jackie Robinson, and many more. On Sherman's first day of school, his teacher asks a few questions about George Washington, Sherman answers all of them, causing a girl named Penny to become jealous. Penny says Sherman is a dog, so he bites her out of anger. Mr. Peabody invited there family over for dinner, Sherman showed her The Way Back. They left and went on an adventure and he left Penny. You'll have to watch it to know the rest. My opinion on this movie is that it is a well made, heart warming cartoon for all ages. The movie shows moral values such as loyalty, love, and friendship. Mr. Peabody is a loving dog and is loyal to Sherman and Penny. Sherman is young and clumsy, but loves Mr. Peabody. Penny is mischievous and curious of things she probably should leave alone.Mr. Peabody is a dog and is the most accomplished canine in the world. He adopted a boy named Sherman and when Sherman is old enough, Mr. Peabody brings Sherman back in time using a time machine called the Wabac to go on outrageous adventures. However, when Sherman takes the Wabac without permission to impress his friend Penny, he accidentally rips a hole in the universe and causes chaos with world history. It's up to Mr. Peabody to mount a rescue and prevent the past, present, and future from being permanently changed. The movie Mr. Peabody and Sherman was boring for the age 13+, but I would recommend for ages younger than that. It teaches about history so it is a good educational movie. The movie brings many different genres into it. Also the voice acting was very good. To make it more of good movie towards 13 year olds they need to add more action scenes. A"
103,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,14 October 2015,A dog can adopt child,"I have decided to watch and review the movie, Mr. Peabody and Sherman, I will know summarize the movie without spoiling the movie. The movie starts when Mr. Peabody ( a dog) shows that he is different than most dogs. He also talks about how he adopted a little boy who is now seven named Sherman. Because, of Peabody's intelligence, he has won a Nobel Prize award and even has a penthouse in New York where he raises Sherman. Mr. Peabody's most important invention is the Wayback, a time machine that he keeps hidden. He uses the time machine to teach Sherman about different periods of history. One day on a school day, Sherman's class is learning about George Washington. When a girl named Penny, tries to answer a question, Sherman contradicts the idea and argued against it. The is argument becomes a fight where Penny mocks Sherman for being a dog. It was told that Sherman bit Penny. Peabody is brought to a counselor who says that she will inspect his lifestyle to see if he is a good parent. One night, Penny and her parents come to Mr. Peabody's house. Mr. Peabody impresses Penny's parents which his skill, while Sherman shows Penny the Wayback.I will now make analysis of the Mr. Peabody and share my opinion. I believe that the movie tried well to show different points of history, but it didn't fulfill its promise. I believe that it should have more accurately expressed the events, but I admit I liked the choice in each of the events. I believe that this movie expressed a lot of equality, stating how if a human can own a dog, a dog should be able to own a human. It also showed the effects of persuasion when Sherman would want to do everything Penny told him to do. Since I have been to few of the places in the movie such as Florence, I enjoyed the settings in the movie and almost remembering it to be just like it was in the movie. If I were to grade this movie on a scale to 1 to 10, I would give it a seven. I believe that this movie won't become a classic, but it is better than most animated movies these days."
104,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,14 October 2015,"Time traveling father and son, find out that if a boy can adopt a dog, then a dog can adopt a boy","The movie Mr. Peabody and Sherman is a children's science fiction movie, with a theme of unconditional love. This very inspirational movie is without doubt, a clear message that any one no matter how small or what kind can be a genius. The movie begins with the introduction of Mr. Peabody explaining his life and his very marvelous achievements throughout it. Then young Sherman enters the movie with the explanation of Mr. Peabody's best invention a time machine. Then they travel in time to the Palace of Versailles in 1789, they attend a dinner party for Queen Marie Antoinette, while trouble is uprising with the people of Paris. Then they go through the many stages of the revolution, during this period Mr. Peabody show his quick thinking and ingenuity when he escapes the fate of the guillotine. At the end of this adventure Mr. Peabody asks the boy about what he learned in this trip. Then they return to the modern day and it is Sherman's first day at school, Mr. Peabody telling Sherman about rules at school and sends him off. At first Sherman makes a good impression in history class, but makes a girl named Penny jealous. This leads to some bulling and in defense Sherman bites her. This calls Mr. Peabody's attention and so does to the Department of Child Safety. This causes tension. Later Mr. Peabody invites the Peterson family (Penny's parents) for a dinner party to settle the matter before The agent comes to inspect the house. Later a temptation forces Sherman to use the Way Back or the time machine, then penny gets engaged to King Tutankhamen and they rescue them, then they to Florence, and many more time traveling mania happens and tension begins to sprout when Sherman finds out that the agent from child safety is trying to take him away from Mr. Peabody. Then they end up in Troy in the Trojan War, after a rescue Mr. Peabody seems to die, but that is not the end.Personally this was and still is a great movie to watch. The whole concept of a dog being a super genius and some fancy scientist intrigues me to watch this. Not only is this movie inspirational but teaches a whole lot about big historical events and how fast the mind can work. I found this a very important key in a children's movie, while in today's society we are hit with a lot of movies that are crammed in with pure nonsense and don't educate the child in an engaging way as this movie does. It is funny, and very engaging not only for children but the whole family as well. I would really recommend it, and it's message to the family viewers of today."
105,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,28 August 2015,Severe Case of Mixed Feelings,"I'll be honest, I never watched the ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" cartoon growing up. I mean, I might have, but I don't remember. Anyway, I decided to watch the new movie not to long ago, since I love time travel stories. And... I'm very mixed about this movie. On one hand, I like what (I think) they did with Mr. Peabody. I get this vibe that Peabody being told he can't be a good father because he's a dog is a metaphor for LBGT people being told that they can't be good parents because they're gay. I don't know anyone raised by LBGT parents, but I'm not against it. Also, Peabody is a very interesting character. I like the jokes surrounding each era they travel to. And, Mel Brooks cameo, you can't go wrong with that. But on the other hand, I really really REALLY hate Penny. This b**** just p***** me off. She is just so mean to Sherman, that I wish she had her hand stabbed in Egypt. I hoped they would drop her off in the Jurassic era, I hate her that much. And my other problem is, why doesn't Peabody just home school Sherman? He's pretty much the smartest thing in the world, so why doesn't he just teach Sherman himself? Anyway, I'm very meh about this movie. There are a lot of things I liked, but there are just as many things that I hated. But I will give it this, it is one of the best movies based on a cartoon in recent history. If you like the original cartoon, then you might like this. If you're like me, then you can watch it once and call it good."
106,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,24 August 2015,You Gotta Love It or  Perhaps Have a Deep Regard,"Dreamworks Decision to Expand the Original Five Minute Episodes Sandwiched In Between Rocky and Bullwinkle Shows to a Full Length Feature Might Seem a Bit Suspicious, but They Pulled It Off in Fine Form. The Popular Jay Ward Animated Series from the Early Sixties, Known for Intelligence and Sophisticated Humor Mixed with Slapstick Featured Rocky & Bullwinkle, Fractured Fairy Tales, Boris & Natasha, and Dudley Do-Right.The Show was a Hit Out of the Box with Both Adults and Children. Critics Also Praised the Show for its Wit and Charm. Each Half-Hour Episode was Filled with Fun and Kept Audiences On Their Toes. This Captures Most of the Flavor from its Five Minute Beginnings and While Not Quite as Dry is Still and Entertaining Update as the Movie is Not Afraid to Push a Few Boundaries Concerning Current Social Considerations. The Classic Story of a Boy and His Dog is Turned On its Head and the Film Considers the Premise of a Dog Adopting a Boy in a Way that the Original Cartoons Never Could Considering Its Context.There is a Visually Impressive Sci-Fi Template as Peabody, Sherman, and Classmate Penny Timehop Courtesy of Mr. P's Invention Called the WABAC (The Wayback Machine). While the Episodes of the TV Show Opened With Sherman Asking ""Where are we going Today Mr. Peabody?"" and He Would Answer, ""Set the Way Back to xxxx."", and After the Adventure Would Always End Each Episode with a Pun. No Such Format Needed Here, Things Just Unfold at the Speed of Light and Never Really Slows Down as the Jokes Fly By and the Improbable History is Colorfully Presented and Skillfully Handled to Make the Movie Enjoyable for All Ages and a Rich and Rewarding Experience."
107,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,1 July 2015,"A Spectacle, Marty McFly Would be Proud.","The plot of the movie may be too modern for a cartoon like Peabody's Improbable Adventures, but it's entertaining, however, it's the humor that steals the show for me, the characters are interesting, there's a lot of jokes about the historic figures, King Agamemnon is like Joe Swanson, Napoleon Bonapart is like the Great Cornholio, and Penny's father is similar to Steve Colbert. The humor is a combo of Archer's non-sex humor and Seth MacFarlene's humor.There's one confusing thing about the film as well, (SPOILER ALERT!!) when Penny and Sherman thought Mr. Peabody died at Troy, they went back in time to the moment where Penny's father is starting to like Peabody as a buddy. If they were smart, they'd go to the moment where Penny questioned Sherman about knowing that Washington didn't actually down trees. And another confusing part as well, if Sherman and Penny went to back to their timeline where Peabody was getting along with Penny's father, shouldn't there be more Pennies and Shermans? What where they thinking?! They've missed an opportunity for a comedic scene! Can you imagine the humor of Penny meeting herself (literally)? Speaking of which, Penny's character is fun and entertaining, especially with Sherman with her, but some of the audience that saw the film are complaining about her being a ""bitch"". She's a just a kid! What do you expect? Her personality is spoiled, especially if she's in a wealthy family! She's not a hypocrite. It could've been funnier, she could've had a twin sister that behaves exactly like her, but has different opinions about Sherman. Siblings arguing, that humor worked in Danny Phantom, Dexter's Lab, Total Drama Pahkitew Island, Step Brothers, why not this movie? Anyway, Penny is an entertaining character, even if she's a spoiled brat, deal with it.But it's the Father-Son bond that makes the show better, at the end of the movie, Sherman's father-son relationship couldn't be more closer than ever. Sherman learned to appreciate the ones that you're with. This is the type of movie Bobby Hill would enjoy with his father or classmates.This movie may not be as good as Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius (A movie just as good as Man of Steel) but it's the American Dad! of Dreamworks, only better. I highly recommend the movie if you want to see a great Dreamworks/FOX movie. Worth every Penny well spent! (Not an intended pun!)"
108,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,5 May 2015,"What we gonna do here is go back, WABAC.  Back into time! (***1/2)","Those south of 30 may not recall the ""Rocky and His Friends"" or ""The Bullwinkle Show"" cartoons, created in the 1950s and shown via syndication in the 1980s. Attached to those shows were segments entitled ""Peabody's Improbable History"", which were neat, albeit corny little entries focused around the world's smartest individual, Mr. Peabody. He just happens to be a beagle, who happens to have an adopted son, Sherman. I remember enjoying the show, more so than the adventures of Rocket J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose, for it focused on science (specifically time travel) and history, and had something to say. They visited a variety of historical figures, breathing life into the people I only read about in class.Despite how neat it was, I was surprised to see that this lesser- known property had the traction to become a major motion picture, for it was something I had forgotten over time. Thankfully ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" is a flick worthy of everyone's attention, and worthy of entering the stream of public conscience again. It isn't content to simply be a hyper children's film, but also isn't so highbrow as to distance itself from the little ones. In other words, it's rather satisfying, excellently rendered family film that gives 'smarts' a palatable voice in a genre that generally excludes them.Mr. Peabody (Burrell) can pretty much do it all. He's a scientist, explorer, inventor, painter, photographer, athlete, chef, etc. Like other high achievers though, he's missing something. That's where Sherman comes in. Mr. Peabody adopts him (which differs from the original show, where Sherman was his pet), as he sees much of himself in the young boy. Luckily, the film acknowledges the species difference, and gracefully allows the explanation to work within the framework of the plot. Mr. Peabody is not so graceful at expressing his feelings, for when Sherman tells his adoptive father he loves him, he's met with a neutral ""I have a very fond regard for you, too"". As you can imagine, that is revisited later in the film.This is an interesting family dynamic- not so much because he's a dog, but because it's non-traditional. Even if it was by accident, the script wonderfully allows for their small, non-traditional family to have the same kind of ups and downs as a 'regular' family. It may be a stretch to draw the conclusion that children who see this will remember this and become more accepting of alternative family situations, but it's pleasant to see a children's film open to different ideas.Interestingly, the same family situation I referenced does drive the plot. Sherman is starting school, and in the process he gets picked on for being the son of a 'dog'. Specifically, a girl named Penny decides he is ripe for the bullying, and picks on him until he actually bites her. That'll earn a trip to the principal's office, and parents, teachers, case workers, etc will get involved. Interestingly, the film doesn't seem interested in the justice or injustice of the situation- after all, the girl did provoke him, but I digress. Mr. Peabody does what he can to mend the situation by having Penny and her parents over for dinner. He's confident that a few drinks and pleasant conversation can wash the situation under the table.As is wont to occasionally happen, the children explore while the adults chat, which leads Sherman to mistakenly show Penny the ""WABAC"". The cleverly-acronymed WABAC is, you guessed it, a time machine (looking more like the 'red matter' from ""Star Trek"" than a time- travel device). Sherman and Penny get themselves into hot water, which requires some clever work on Mr. Peabody's part to set things straight. The resulting adventure through time is crisp, funny, and reverent to the original material. Director Rob Minkoff (""The Lion King"") once again proves himself a very capable craftsman of animated features, managing to give us comedic and beautiful scenes interlaced with a needed intelligence.The film isn't without its' flaws, however. For as much as I praised it earlier for allowing smart to be cool, the filmmakers made the choice not to explain how Mr. Peabody figures out time travel. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention the scientific inaccuracies, for this film has not heard of the 'butterfly effect'. Clearly Mr. Peabody's actions would have drastic effects on the present, but it's entirely possible that I'm giving this too much thought. It's an unfortunate choice, for if it trusts kids to enjoy being confident with their intelligence, it should have trusted them to enjoy being challenged as well. These criticisms don't hurt the film on the whole, however. It's enjoyable for everyone, and by being picky, I'm criticizing the film's flip- flop on whether or not to trust us with 'smart' stuff. That's hardly a reason not to enjoy a tale of a beagle and his pet, I mean son."
109,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,10 December 2014,Generally entertaining film,"""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" is the big-screen, computer-animated version of the delightful cartoon series from the 1950s and early 1960s, which featured the time-traveling escapades of Mr. Peabody, the long-eared, pun-spouting canine scientist, and his human sidekick, Sherman, the orphaned red-headed boy whom Peabody has adopted and raised as his own son. Together they use the trusty WABAC machine that Peabody has invented to travel back in time to major events in history and encounters with some of the most famous figures the world has ever known. Though much of the history is of the fractured, revisionist type - freely mixing fact with fiction, reality with myth - there is always a lighthearted moral lesson to be imparted both to the ever- quizzical Sherman and to the audience as a whole.This latest incarnation finds Mr. Peabody and Sherman time-tripping their way back to such destinations as the French Revolution, ancient Egypt, Renaissance Italy and war-torn Troy, where they meet up with Marie Antoinette, King Tut, Leonardo Da Vinci and (the mythological) King Agamemnon, respectively. Written by Craig Wright and directed by Rob Minkoff, the movie boasts snappy dialogue, zippy pacing, a clean, streamlined design and more in- jokes and cultural references aimed at the grownups in the audience than one might reasonably expect from a movie of this sort (there are at least two fairly off-color jokes that children likely won't get but adults certainly will).""Modern Family's"" Ty Burrell does a first rate job giving voice to Mr. Peabody, nicely replicating the work done originally by Bill Scott. Ditto for Max Charles as Sherman, as well as Stephen Colbert, Allison Janney, and Stanley Tucci, among others, in supporting roles.Yet, for all its virtues, ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" reminds us of something that the creators of the original series - and that includes the great Jay Ward - apparently knew all along, which is that certain pleasures in this life are best appreciated when taken in smaller doses."
110,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,8 December 2014,"If a boy can adopt a dog, then a dog should be able to adopt a boy!","And then there's the WABAC...This is a fun and entertaining animated science fiction movie, with really good voice acting. Before I saw this movie I was not at all familiar with Mr Peabody or Sherman, so everything I now know about them, I discovered during the roughly 90 minutes running time.Mr Peabody is a little white dog, but not your ordinary dog. He is a Harvard graduate, and Valedogtorian. He has patents and is wealthy, basically smarter and more accomplished than any human on Earth.Then he decided, if a boy can adopt a dog, then a dog should be able to adopt a boy. Which he does, legally, Sherman is his son. Sherman is 7 years old and smart but socially awkward, and on his first day at his new school makes an enemy of the little blond girl. When Mr Peabody sets up a surprise visit by the little girl and her parents that is the catalyst for the main story.You see, one of Mr Peabody's inventions, a secret one, is the WABAC, a fancy acronym for a time-travel machine. Although Sherman is told not to ever tell anyone, he inadvertently mentions it to the little blond girl, and she gets him to take them back to the King Tut time of Egypt, where she narrowly escapes becoming the boy-king's bride.And so it goes, there is various travels to various times, and they meet up with such historical figures as Da Vinci, Presidents Washington and Lincoln, Ben Franklin, Einstein, and others. They end up disturbing the space-time continuum and Mr Peabody has to fix it, with a good idea from Sherman. The animation is really good, the sound track is really good, and the whole movie is very entertaining."
111,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,16 September 2014,Tacitly Entertaining for Kids and Adults,"Mr. Peabody's Improbable History was a small sometimes five minute reoccurring cartoon sketch wedged into The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show (1959-1961) as a humorous quasi-educational segment. In it Mr. Peabody (originally voiced by Bill Scott), a dog and smartest mind in the world adopted a human child named Sherman (Walter Tetley). Needing a quality education, Mr. Peabody invents the Wayback Machine to give Sherman substantive lessons in World History. While throwing in some usefully factoids, the majority of the cartoon was filled with clever historical in-jokes and plays on words.The full-length big-screen version of the time-traveling duo takes advantage of its dated material to make for entertaining fare. In it Peabody (now voiced by Ty Burrell) risks losing his son (Max Charles) after he gets into a fight at school and bites a classmate. ""A dog can never be a father to a human boy"" says Ms. Grunion (Allison Janney) of Child Protective Services. Attempting to patch things up before things get grave, Peabody invites the family of accosted classmate Penny (Ariel Winter) to dinner which leads to Sherman using the Wayback Machine and inadvertently leaving Penny in Ancient Egypt. Can Peabody and Sherman get Penny back home before they destroy the very fabric of space and time? First the good news; we all still exists (depending on who you ask). The space time continuum was not flummoxed by Mr. Peabody & Sherman (2014). Additionally, the film provides some inspired lessons on alternative families, caring for your loved ones and discovering your potential. The color scheme in the film pops out at you and the animation is wonderful. Credit must be given to Rob Minkoff who also worked on such classic fare as The Little Mermaid (1989), The Lion King (1994) and Stuart Little (1999). Additionally as with the source material, the dialogue is amusing and the history for the most part works. If you're a parent with young children I recommend Mr. Peabody & Sherman as it is both colorful and doesn't talk down to your kids.That being said, the film is not without its faults which includes some gags falling flat. While in a live action film it's impressive to see a character make mixed drinks by juggling glasses, ice trays and bar shakers, in a cartoon its not quite fun unless someone's prat- falling. Peabody himself is as smooth, elegant and self-assured as Dean Martin but Sherman's Jerry Lewis-like antics come off as cloying more than they do entertaining by comparison. Perhaps if Peabody was a little more self-absorbed or a little more ascorbic we wouldn't feel quite so bad for him every time Sherman or Penny screws something up.As with all time machine movies Peabody has talk about time travel paradoxes and other metaphysical quandaries yet here there's no effort to make those event and conversations believable or understandable to the audience. If the writers wanted to simply remove references to altering the present through the past a la Midnight in Paris (2011) they could have done so keeping the story centered on getting home. Or if they really wanted to go Back to the Future Part II (1989) on us it'd allow for decent after-film conversations with parents and their middle-schoolers. Unfortunately they wanted to have their cake and eat it too; leaving the audience without adequate info yet half- heartedly throwing in an explanation or too. All for the sake of seeing Beethoven on a Dance Dance Revolution machine.Ultimately kids will enjoy it, adults won't despise it and the elderly will recall the segments of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show when Sherman and Mr. Peabody first made their debut. As for students of history or time-travel enthusiasts, maybe you should consider the movie apocryphal.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
112,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,25 August 2014,A great update from 2d to the 3d.,"I liked last two movies from DreamWorks Animations. Besides Disney and Pixer I kind of like this production house because the first ever 3D animation I ever saw was 'Antz', when I was a child. In their 30 movies this is only the second movie based on sci-fi after 'Megamind'. I was familiar with 'Mr. Peabody and Sherman' before, but kind of inconsistent in watching them when it was aired on television. So I expected nothing, but enjoyed watching this movie. A matured story, the cute characters and a pleasant animation, overall an excellent update from the cartoon to the 3D characters. When Disney did same for Micky family I was disappointed a lot. You know 2D animations are kind of jerky animations and that is a different kind of pleasure, but this one was so smooth, I loved it.Mr. Peabody had a regret that he was not adopted when he was a puppy. Now he's an adult dog, also a smart and intelligent. Decides to adopt a boy and names him Sherman. He teaches everything that he knows and tours with him to the different eras for the educational purpose through his invention WABAC, a time-machine. One day in the school Sherman gets humiliated for saying the truth and a big trouble knocks the Mr. Peabody's door. To make everything right a first step had been taken, but accidentally an adventure begins through times and space. A trouble after another follows them and what they need is one solution that can solve all their problems is the rest of the story.''Every dog should have a boy!''If you think it's for kids only referring the 60s animated television series, definitely you are wrong. When you see the characters anyone can feel that way, but once you watch the movie your perspective will change. Many things were taken straight from the series like time travelling adventures. In fact, to say adults can understand the story fully than children. It meets lots of historical events in the original timeline, but the fun part was to see them in an animation. A coming-of-age theme in animation, but was told in a fun adventure. It just fulfilled me of watching all the episodes of the original classic animation short, at a time. Like I said young kids can't get what's happening, but can have fun which delivered consistently throughout with the nice dialogues and locations. I hope they are going to announce a sequel, otherwise it will be a disappointment to know there will be no follow-up for a cute little movie."
113,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,30 June 2014,Barking up the wrong tree,"This film tells the story of a young boy who has a very clever dog as his adopted father. He travels through time with his father on a time machine, with disastrous results.Alarm bells should have been ringing when I found out that a boy was adopted by a dog, but I kept on watching. And the result was that I watched an unimaginably atrocious animation. Normally I like these blockbuster animations, but ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" is beyond terrible. The plot is so far fetched that is almost insulting to the intelligence. The worst problem is that Mr Peabody is an uptight Mr Know It All. He is so annoying and antagonism-inspiring that I simply cannot stand him. If the studio thinks he is cute, the executives are certainly barking up the wrong tree."
114,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,5,8 March 2014,Do we want bullying to be funny?,"I wanted a simple comedy to relax with. Other reviewers said they laughed a lot. I just shook my head at the disrespect shown throughout the movie. Without giving away too many spoilers, some of the jokes involved hurting other characters. We have a nationwide campaign to stop bullying yet in this movie it is okay to coerce others with the message that you will be forgiven, kidnap women and they will love you, and okay to get the neighbors drunk so they will forget about the abuses shown their children. Is this what we want our children to learn, that it is okay to force others to do our bidding?While some characters do show remorse for some of this behavior, the idea that the cruelty was supposed to be funny ruined the experience for me."
115,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,9,16 February 2014,Try and watch this movie,"We'll what were you thinking when you saw the trailer, it was very good,Mr Peabody and ShermanWell spoiler alertIt takes place 1 DAY!? And they go to the American revulsion and Egyptand Rome and troyand back home Bye **** Hubble review It is a very loud movie so if you are autistic better bring ear plugs Its just so stunning The funniest thing is the ""space wrap scene"" Leo DiCaprio's voice is so soothing age rating: pg for Mr Peabody And Sherman and U for Hubble"
116,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,3,5 April 2014,Just misses the mark in my opinion,"No real spoilers here on plot themes. I'm just trying to prepare parents of young children a bit.Going into detail on how mummies were created, including a picture illustrating the disembowelment of the corpse, was over the top. Maybe not for 10+ year olds but for younger kids, can bring up some rather disturbing questions.The little girl and the bullying scene was pretty lame as well. That girl had no redeeming value whatsoever. I loved the show myself back in the day so I was excited for this movie. Disappointing to say the least."
117,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,10,29 March 2014,Multiple levels of Meaning and Exhilarating 3D effects,"Mr. Peabody and Sherman is more than just a movie about a Dog-Genius father and his adopted son. It is a movie that, at least for me, enabled me to develop a deeper spiritual trust and relationship with my own father. My dad and I went out to this movie last night and after we talked about what the movie really means. It is a movie about a relationship between father and son that gradually develops respect and trust between Mr. Peabody and Sherman. There is also a Spiritual element that some of the kids probably wouldn't catch on to. The Dog is more than just a symbol of a perfect father figure he is a symbol of a Spiritual father a symbol of cosmic love a symbol of deep Spiritual trust. Movies like this build up the next generation and are big in culture-creation. The dog star has a knack for visual binary intelligence and is a witty and dedicated pal. I look forward to more feature films with ""mans best friend"" that bring the next generation into a deeper level of solidarity through presenting educational standards in a way that is memorable."
118,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,27 February 2014,The Film Authority reviews Mr Peabody & Sherman,"Dreamworks delve into the Rocky and Bullwinkle universe with Mr Peabody and Mr Sherman, a lighthearted romp for kids about a time-traveling dog (Mr Peabody) and his adopted son Sherman. One look at the character designs tells you that the overall intent is to be lovable, and while Peabody and Sherman's adventures are easy to watch, they lack the post-modern gusto of The Lego Movie. Peabody may be a simple canine, but he's also a genius, and his mastery of science and particularly time travel are established early on. The intricacies of parenting are a different matter, and Sherman has abandonment issues when he starts school. Sherman breaks his father's golden rules by showing off their time machine to pretty schoolmate Penny, and a chase through history results taking in Troy, ancient Rome, the American revolution and more. One adult double entendre aside, Mr Peabody and Sherman is a Bill and Ted-style romp through the history books, with enough references to stop adults getting bored and plenty of slapstick for kids. Penny, however, is an unlikable character, and her early aggression to Sherman is unjustified as she rapidly becomes a member of the time-traveling team. Her presence is a bum-note in an otherwise streamlined adventure; while not as good as The Croods or How To Train Your Dragon, Mr Peabody and Sherman is decent enough fare to keep the little-ones amused. The Film Authority"
119,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,5,26 December 2014,Time traveling tale goes nowhere,"Though it mostly avoids the sort of cheap, focus group humor that plagued DreamWorks Animation projects like the 'Shrek' and 'Kung-Fu Panda' series, 'Mr. Peabody & Sherman' ultimately falls victim to a lack of focus and trying to cram too much into 90 minutes.Also suspect is the animation, which looks no better than your average episode of 'Doc McStuffins'. I'm not sure where the $145 million dollars of its reported budget went, but it certainly doesn't look like it went towards animation.There are some genuine moments of wit and humor here, and the voice cast is certainly game, but it's just not enough to save this lackluster effort."
120,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,12 August 2014,"""Old 'flip flop Ra' we call him.""","Enjoyable updated version of the old Mr. Peabody cartoons from the Rocky & Bullwinkle Show. I always liked that segment of the show and I feel like it was a good idea to turn that into a feature, since the premise can sustain more than the simple few minutes it did in the cartoon series. However, while I enoyed the movie, there were flaws. I felt like they didn't get the most out of the central concept of these two traveling through time in Peabody's WABAC machine. Going to various periods in history could have filled a whole movie, but they got wrapped up in the rather lame plot involving a social worker threatening to take Sherman away from Peabody. The best parts of the movie were the ones that dealt with them actually living up to the premise of the cartoon and going to different points in history.It doesn't take a genius to see that the relationship between Peabody and his adopted son Sherman was a thinly-veiled metaphor for gay parents adopting kids. Nothing wrong with that but the way it was handled was a little forced at times. Particularly with the whole issue of Sherman not wanting to be called a dog, like that was the worst insult possible. Dog being a stand-in for more hateful language, obviously. Good intentions but a little bit of that stuff goes a long way and it did start to seem like a 'message movie' towards the end. They should have focused more on the adventure through history with just a little of the parent plot. It would have been more effective that way, in my opinion."
121,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,3 April 2014,A Movie the whole family will enjoy.,My sons don't know who Mr Peabody and Sherman are. They've never watched Rocky and Bullwinkle. Which really is a shame. My wife hates Rocky and Bullwinkle. Which might explain a lot. When the movie came out all they knew were the toys and the commercials.So having a free movie pass we took a chance and saw this movie. It was fun and highly enjoyable. It had a sense of humour about itself. It never once took it self serious. Or got too wrapped up in itself. No. It kept it's pace nd gave us a good solid story with a message. Now normally I don't like films that push too strong with it's messages. But this film was subtle with it. Love your family and don't bully. And family does not always mean blood. There are enough adult type jokes here to keep the grown ups laughing and enough humour for the kids. I enjoyed it simply because it was fun. That's it pure fun. Nothing so serious. No swearing no sex scenes no bloody violence. Just a movie that flowed nice and easy. My kids loved it. And are still quoting this movie a week later. That says a lot . It stays in the head as a pleasant after thought. Back to when We were kids and the world was simple and not complicated.
122,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,5,17 March 2014,Too much corny jokes for me,"Mr. Peabody and ShermanI was curious about the movie seeing it debuted at the middle number of Box Office yet a week later defeated ""300: Rise of An Empire"".The story follows Mr. Peabody a talking super genius dog who invented a time machine (wait a minute, it's gets weird here *scratches my head even as I write this*) and. adopted Sherman, a human boy, as his son. (and GOAL!! It doesn't get weirder LOL). With the time machine, Mr. Peabody often takes Sherman to visit various times and places, sometimes even interacting with historical figures and events.On his first day of school, Sherman goes into a fight with a girl, Penny, because she calls him a dog. Mr. Peabody then invites Penny's family for reconciliation dinner. Penny again insults Sherman and Sherman shows her the time machine, with which Penny goes to Ancient Egypt and gets into trouble. The father and son duo rescued her but the machine's power is so decreased it can only bring them to Renaissance Italy.The basic story is so ridiculous it's stupid. The genius dog not only talks, he also plays piano, lefty rock guitar, and many other musical instruments. Talk about a genius. But that's what makes it doable as an animation movie. And it doesn't stop there. Who would thought that Sherman can do parkour-style clinging strafe just like all the stealth action characters do? LOLNevertheless this movie takes the stupid story into a higher level of assumptions and into far more serious issues such as the competence of foster or adopted parents.The jokes are indeed quite corny. The repeated Sherman quirk of ""I don't get it"" and the booby trap joke. And the last is, I am not even sure it's meant to be joke or not but it's too corny to be a joke and too stupid to be a serious moment, is the ""I'm a dog too"" moment. That stupid moment is topped by ""I'm Spartacus"", now that's a funny twist.The character building is hilariously stupid, that it is making those characters funny. Leonardo Da Vinci, Agamemnon and Robespierre characters are the ones having radical touches that even historians will laugh at because they are way out of their perceived character according to history.The voice acting is nice and clean. The choice of colors is neat and doesn't really strut the eyes the whole 90 minutes-or-so long of the movie. The soundtrack and scoring is a good complementing features of the movie, being able to be just noticeable with suiting tunes for each of the scenes.For me overall I enjoyed the movie but not necessarily entertained by it. I'd give a 5 out of 10 score and don't rally recommend you to go and see this at the movies."
123,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,14 February 2014,Fun for ALL the family - recommended,"Mr Peabody is a mega-genius dog, and Sherman is his adopted son. While trying to resolve a schoolyard dispute between Sherman and Penny, the two kids take Mr Peabody's time machine and wreak mayhem in ancient Egypt, the Reformation, and Troy, all while Mr Peabody is trying to placate Penny's parents and fend off Miss Grunnion, the Child Welfare Officer who does not believe a dog is fit to raise a boy.This 3D CGI movie is based on something which never made it to the UK. Assessed on its own, it is great fun - it will please kids, being visually attractive, full of gags and action, and with an emotional heart, and there is plenty in it to keep mums and dads amused too (plus I am a sucker for time travel stories).The voice cast all does well (the two kids are excellent), the 3D is effective, and it is fun. I really liked it."
124,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,3,6 May 2015,Mr. Pea Brain and Stupid.,"Mr. Peabody and Sherman (2014): Dir: Rob Minkoff / Voices: Ty Burrell, Max Charles, Ariel Winter, Allison Janney, Stephen Colbert: Ridiculously stupid animated garbage It regards the odd combination of a brilliant dog named Mr. Peabody and his adopted abandoned human son Sherman for which he somehow has custody of. Central plot regards a time machine created apparently by Mr. Peabody and the quest to rescue Sherman's bullying classmate Penny from marrying in Egypt. Director Rob Minkoff made the masterpiece animation The Lion King but this is a major step down from that film. The idiotic screenplay jumps from place to place within a time machine with lame jokes thrown in for good measure. The children have heads five times bigger than their body. It's like balancing a boulder atop a small rock. This relationship is totally lost on me. I can buy toys coming to life behind our backs but a dog, even this smart, adopting a boy is stretching it into the realms of moronic. Ty Burrell voices Peabody who desperately wants to remain Sherman's guardian. Max Charles voices the bratty easily influenced Sherman. Ariel Winter plays the conniving Penny who is more trouble than ten kids. Allison Janney has the thankless role of child services representative. Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann voice Penny's uptight parents. This comes out the same year as Lego Movie and despite a strong message regarding parenting, it never matches that film's imaginative creative visual wonders. Instead we have children with huge heads and viewers with a huge disappointment. Score: 3 / 10"
125,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,23 March 2014,Has its moments but falls flat,"The good news. The transition from 2-D to 3-D, so often mishandled, is very well done here. Peabody looks like a good 3-D version of himself and Sherman is extremely well done. And the voices are very faithful to the original. The adult level humor and bad puns are out in force. The big problem is that the main conflict revolves around a gratingly clichéd plot. On his first day at school, Sherman retaliates against a bullying classmate, which in turn unleashes a loud (of course) fat (of course) and ugly (of course) bully of a social worker, who threatens to have Peabody's custody of Sherman revoked. NOBODY has EVER thought of this before. Now even that could have been satisfyingly resolved by using the Wayback Machine to drop her onto the Titanic or in Pompeii, but instead Peabody tries to win over the classmate's uptight Yuppie parents, while Sherman creates a rip in the space-time continuum by taking the Wayback for an unauthorized spin.Just like the 1986 animated Transformers movie was half a dozen ten-minute episodes strung end to end, this movie is half a dozen Peabody's Improbable History episodes strung together. The best by far is a visit to Leonardo da Vinci, where Sherman and his nemesis Penny (the bitten one) launch a prototype of Leonardo's flying machine and go swooping through Renaissance Florence on a visually stunning ride. Other vignettes include the French Revolution, ancient Egypt, and the Trojan War, and you just can't make a guillotine, the details of mummification, or the sack of Troy funny. You might as well just paste the characters into 300. And the finale blows the cover of the Wayback Machine big time by showing it to half of New York."
126,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,5,17 March 2014,A dog and his boy.,"Dreamworks Animation usually means near perfection, enjoyable escape and a big payday for all involved. I just don't feel the love with MR. PEABODY & SHERMAN. The twosome had small segments on the classic TV show Rocky & His Friends(1959-1964). Now maybe I would like Rocky and Bullwinkle better; I just don't know. At hand is Mr. Peabody, a scientist, inventor, and yes...genius. Oh, yes. Mr. Peabody happens to be a dog. Proof of his extraordinary abilities is his invention, the WABAC machine...the transporter to historic moments in the past. Mr. Peabody and his adopted boy, Sherman use the WABAC machine to get up close and personal with some of the greatest people in the history of mankind and get to experience world-changing moments first hand. Mr. Peabody and Sherman find themselves trying to save history and keep it intact for deep into the future. This animated feature is rated PG, I guess for the mild obligatory potty and rude humor. My main reason for not really liking this movie is truthfully...I'm no fan of some of the actors providing the voices. Some of those overrated people giving voice to characters: Stephen Colbert, Allison Janney and Ty Burrell. Giving credit where it is due; I did like Leslie Mann, Dennis Haysbert and Steve Valentine. I have to admit Max Charles, was very good making Sherman an enjoyable little boy and even funny. Animation and color:excellent."
127,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,5,12 May 2014,"OK, but far below the original","The original Mr. Peabody and Sherman appeared in the 60's, inside the Rocky and Bullwinkle show. It was just one feature, not even an entire show of its own. The writing was amazing for 60's television. It worked for very young children, but adults liked it as well because of the multi-layered dialog. Many of the jokes went past the kids, but made the mature viewers laugh out loud.The movie is aimed at children up to 8 years old. The writing is adequate, but nowhere near the level of the writers 50 years ago. The animation is also OK, but nothing that breaks new ground. The Way Back time machine was a missed opportunity, more like a round red time ball that moved through blue tubes. The characters don't change, no one grows. They just threw a bunch of historical figures with no personality into the mix, trying to recreate the magic of the original.Rent this one for your young (very young) kids. You won't want to waste your time watching it yourself."
128,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,,15 March 2014,WHY can't ALL the ripped off ticket buyers comment directly on . . .,". . . the miserable short EVERY single MR.PEABODY AND SHERMAN customer was forced to watch, put out by OPEN SEASON 2 Co-director Todd Wilderman. This was a last-minute substitution for the previously announced updated episode of ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE (the beloved TV show of which the original MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN episodes were only a small part). Money-paying theater patrons felt shortchanged, not only because DreamWorks went back on its pledge, but also due to the fact that the ABOUT HOME short was so deficient in story and animation quality. If the ""Scrat"" shorts done to preview the ICE AGE feature cartoon series merit 9 or 10 on a scale of 10, rating ABOUT HOME at 1 or 2 would be way too generous. The Scrat shorts had pages on IMDb enabling user ratings the minute they were first in theaters. Somehow, the conflagration of criticism burning ABOUT HOME is only flaring up through back drafts, as it is the first widely-distributed American film since IMDb was created to succeed SOMEHOW (bribes? free passes? business-to-business blackmail?) in NOT being available on its OWN DESIGNATED PAGE, always provided for this purpose in the past, forcing hundreds of IMDb users to vent their spleens on the MR. PEABODY message boards instead of a more appropriate place designated specifically for messages and reviews concerning the ABOUT HOME short. Do not spend your money on OPEN SEASON 2 or any other DreamWorks product UNTIL this scandal is cleaned up! Otherwise, who knows what IMDb pages could disappear next--HEAVEN'S GATE? ISHTAR? BATTLESHIP? Tom Cruise? Tyler Perry? Adam Sandler?"
129,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,8,8 August 2015,Misogyny still rules cartoons,"I fondly remember this cartoon from my childhood. The script appeared true to my memory (granted, I haven't seen the cartoon in about 50 years), loaded with silly jokes for the adults. Sadly, back then I'd already learned that all the best characters were male. I try to accept this. Despite that, this movie was nearly perfect. What ruined it? Sherman gets credit for being the ""first man to fly,"" when it was his female friend who flew first. She initiated the activity and had to force him to try it. Then she stood to the side with a smile while he got all the credit. THIS INFURIATES ME! There was no reason for that scene to be written that way. Just a minor change could have kept it honest, and it would have earned a 10 rating."
130,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,5,17 June 2015,This film is really really stupid,"Mr Peabody and Sherman is directed by the same man who directed my second favourite movie of all time The Lion King and of course Stuart Little 1 and 2 and its about a genius dog named Mr Peabody(really that is the name of the dog and his voiced by Ty Burcell)who created a time- machine called the WASBAC and he adopted a son and named him Sherman(voiced by Max Charles from The Amazing Spiderman films). Together the unlikely duo go off on many adventures together from Egypt to Paris. But when Sherman's bully named Penny(voiced by Ariel Winter from Sofia The First)gets invited to dinner with her parents,Sherman proves to her that his ""father"" created a time machine that can rip through time(yeah its like that 2001 film Kate & Leopold which is also about time travelling)and of course all hell breaks loose and its up to Mr Peabody and Sherman to save Penny from Egypt and try and figure a way home.Now time travel has been used in a lot of films. Parts of this film surprisingly reminded me of Dr Who with the whole vortex and we see Mr Peabody and Sherman along with Penny go through time and like I have mentioned they get to visit really cool places from the past. But the time machine is only allowed for the past as if its used in present day then there will be 2 of the same person that already exists.The problem I had with this movie was that there was no explanation on how Mr Peabody created the actual time machine in the first place. Granted in lets say the film Kate & Leopold,you actually see a diagram of the actual time portal,here in this film you don't see any diagram of the WASBAC. I dunno maybe kids would get bored if the director elaborated on the whole time traveling thing but still though it would be cool if there was a scene to show how it was created in the first place. Also is it me or does it bother anyone else that an actual dog can adopt a human boy. Its just so so stupid,and yes Mr Peabody isn't like an average household pet but still it was kinda daft. Then again I probably am not the target audience for this movie and I love animated films ranging from Tangled to How To Train Your Dragon 1 and 2(which is the best Dreamworks movie of all time for me btw).Bottom line if you have kids and they love seeing the world or if you are a fan of Sci-Fi and time travel than check it out. If not than avoid this one as its not the best Dreamworks movie in my opinion its pretty average and I was shocked as the director behind this film(as I have mentioned) directed my second favourite movie of all time The Lion King.2.5/5Out of 10 a 5/10Very average kids movie C+"
131,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,5 May 2015,Mr Peabody and Sherman and . . . weird.,"I'm finding the animated films of late...weird. Mr Peabody and Sherman is no exception. The central theme is questionable and left me wondering how much drugs were smoked by all the creative voices involved, namely the writers and the executives who like to butcher scripts.To me this story was nothing short of a ""Master and Slave"" movie, exploring the relationship between man and dog in a surreally inverted way.Sherman was a frustrating character (I tend to find the overly clumsy and non-sensicle characters harder to swallow and watch). Peabody was witty in a dry way and provided just enough of the right humour to keep this above the line.Other than that, beautifully rendered as usual. Animators deserve more respect and credit than they deserve."
132,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,7,5 April 2015,More for younger kids,"Penny has got to be one of the most annoying child characters I've seen. She is so inquisitive, bossy, bullying and impulsive. She's 6 or 7 but is childish. Her relationship with Sherman is clichéd even though the movie is anyway. I would've liked it better if she was more nicer and original. She even almost kills herself in favor of Sherman! But I don't know if she is even necessary to the movie anyway, I haven't seen the t.v. series, so...though, the movie is entertaining and there were only a couple of scenes that were funny, but it's geared more towards younger audiences. Sherman is a cool character. It was cute and heart-warming, but the ending ruined it somewhat. I think it has some good messages but are easily forgotten.I didn't care if she died or was in trouble. I wanted her to be left in the eras. There were some scenes that were unrealistic and the movie is cloying.I don't think that a very young audience will be able to understand it."
133,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,13 March 2015,You can tell there was a much better picture that intended to be here... sadly it isn't there,"Mr. Peabody is one of a string of recent animated films (and even live-action films) where you can tell the makers had a lot of good ideas and love for what they were making... but they just didn't know how to show it. It is really saddening to watch this movie because there are legitimate moments that could've been gripping, emotional, and really good... but they are either way too short, or the execution falls flat.The premise of Mr. Peabody and Sherman is based off of the cartoon skit from Rocky and Bullwinkle. Mr. Peabody is a super intelligent dog who is a master at everything. He also has an adopted boy whom he cares for very much. The main focus of the movie is the relationship between a dog and his boy: Peabody learning to love Sherman for who he is and Sherman being able to accept Peabody after being made fun of for being a dog.This has some very interesting moments because Sherman keeps on treating the term ""dog"" as if it is an insult... but Peabody is a dog. So essentially Sherman finds it offensive to be like his father, yet he loves his father. This is a really good concept because there are many awkward moments where Sherman is blissfully unaware to the damage he is dealing to Peabody.The movie is full of small hidden gems like this and the humour in the movie can be quite funny... and at other times not as much.The big issue with the movie is that it throws in generic tropes at the same time: The evil person who wants to separate the adopted father from kid who has no real reason to do so except they are evil, the forced romance between the main character and an evil bully girl, and the lame speech ending where everyone agrees with the speech. These moments are incredibly painful because they come out of nowhere and are done so horribly. The movie feels it needs to throw in generic elements of the worst animated movies.That being said, Peabody and Sherman left me more with sadness at the end of the credits because you can see that there was originally a really good concept with some good ideas. Just from the ending credits, you can hear the score and tell that something much more emotional and truly beautiful was planned. As I sat through credits I thought ""Dang, I can visually see what this movie was supposed to be.""All in all, it isn't a terrible movie, but it has a lot of issues. It was still entertaining and had its moments, but it could've been more."
134,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,5,3 January 2015,Skip this trip through time,"Part and parcel of rearing a kid is having to watch a movie you wouldn't normally gravitate to. MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN is one of those movies; it's flashy and busy but doesn't really have anything to offer. More than that, it can be downright manic. I liked that they tried to slip in some teachable history, but it was in too big a hurry to get to the next scene. What kid could absorb that? Aside from that, it was a little too self-aware, the humor derived from hip references. Not my bag. Also, did anyone else just want to blast Penny in the face as badly as I did? She's an instigator.It's funny, the way they cut the trailer for this, the Warburton bits were the most painful. Turns out, next to Da Vinci, he was the shining star of this thing. I was also surprised by the names they got for this movie. But it's as forgettable as they cone.5/10"
135,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,2 January 2015,"Some Clever Moments, Not Ultimately Satisfying","The time-traveling adventures of an advanced canine and his adopted son, as they endeavor to fix a time rift they created.The old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon was decent, but rarely ever anyone's favorite. And within that show, Mr. Peabody was definitely one of the better segments, but still not the greatest. And that is more or less how the film turns out.There are some decent jokes here, plenty of bad puns, and lots of dated references. But no original plot, and nothing that is going to make this anyone's favorite film, or even favorite film of 2014. Most who saw it probably already forgot. While they managed to keep the spirit of the original, maybe they should have pushed for a little something more."
136,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,29 November 2014,Surprisingly enjoyable! 6/10,"Review: For a kiddie movie, I quite enjoyed watching these magnificent men, or should I say dog, in there flying machine. The storyline was well put together and the attention to detail was spot on. The concept is a bit crazy, but it's the different characters which keeps the movie interesting for kids and adults. Basically an extremely clever dog adopts a kid and they build a time machine so they can go back in time. On the way, they make many friends who help them repair an accident that happened in there past. Strange but true. Anyway, it's harmless fun for the whole family and I'm sure that people will find a character that will make them laugh. My personal favourite was Leonardo Da Vinci and the Spartans. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Judging by the money that this film made at the box office, I'm not alone with thinking that this was a will made movie. Personally, the dogs voice got on my nerves after a while but the movie really wouldn't have worked without him. If your watching the film from an adults point of view, the time travel aspect is extremely clever and quite complex but it doesn't make the movie confusing for the kiddies. I hope they come out with a sequel soon because it's hard to find an animation movie which has something for the adults as well as the kids.Budget: $145million Worldwide Gross: $273millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation movies about a dog who adopts a boy and they build a time machine so they can go back in time. 6/10"
137,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,5,25 September 2014,None of the style or cleverness that made the original series such a classic!,"'MR. PEABODY & SHERMAN': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Computer animated feature film based on the popular characters Mr. Peabody and Sherman, from the 1960s cartoon series 'THE ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE SHOW'. They're once again on a time traveling mission, using Mr. Peabody's most prized invention 'the WABAC machine'. Ty Burrell stars as the voice of Mr. Peabody and Max Charles plays Sherman. The film also costars the voice talents of Ariel Winter, Leslie Mann, Allison Janney and Stephen Colbert. It was directed by Rob Minkoff; who's directed other hit kids movies like 'STUART LITTLE', 'STUART LITTLE 2' and 'THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM' (he also co-directed 'THE LION KING'). It was written by Craig Wright and based on characters created by Ted Key. Despite grossing more than $272.9 million worldwide, at a budget of just $145 million, DreamWorks Animation (the studio which produced the film) claims it was a financial failure for them; and a $57 million write-down (it did get mostly good reviews from critics though). For me the movie felt pretty dull and uninspired.Mr. Peabody (Burrell) is a genius dog who, despite his many successes, grew up an outcast. When he found Sherman (Charles), as an orphan baby, he could relate to him; due to the alienation he felt growing up as a young canine. When Sherman bites a girl, named Penny Peterson (Winter), for mocking him at school, a bigoted child and family services agent (Janney) threatens to take the child away from the dog. While Sherman tries to make up with Penny he shows her the WABAC machine and the two cause a time rift. It's then up to Mr. Peabody to set things right and save them. I watched the original 'THE ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE SHOW', when I was a kid growing up, and enjoyed it quite a bit. It had a lot of charm and originality; and Mr. Peabody and Sherman were a big part of it. This modern film adaptation has none of the style or cleverness, that it had. It might be funny and amusing enough, for little kids, but something closer, and more fitting, to the original series would have been much better (and more entertaining for children). Having been a fan of the show, as a kid, I have to say this film is a big disappointment to me. Also I just found it to be really boring, routine and poorly made. It's not one of the worst animated films ever but it's certainly not one of the best (in any way) either.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/Kq2wN7LTcuo"
138,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,19 September 2014,Not great but not bad...,"As a child, I use to indulge in the reruns of ""The Bullwinkle Show"" and enjoyed the segments that involved the time traveling smart dog named Mr. Peabody and his adopted son that he treated like a pet named Sherman. Sure, it wasn't my favorite cartoon in all of existence and I forgot it existed until The Simpsons referenced themand then proceeded to forget about them all over again until this film was adapted but, the lesson here is, I did eventually remember that I enjoyed them and their adventures.I wouldn't say my hopes were high for this one but I was thinking I was going to get a silly animated film about a genius dog having time traveling fun with his adopted human son. For the most part, that's what I got and that's what I liked about the film. I thought the cast was great, the animation looked decent, the movie wasn't uproarious with its humor but I still laughed on occasion, and I really enjoyed the sweet side of the film and the emotion is poured out with its themes about family and fatherhood. However, the movie was a little sloppy with its presentation as it couldn't balance out its conflicts in its story and it dragged a couple of times.""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" is far from terrible but it's just as far from great, as well. While I was never bored with the film, I wasn't completely wowed by it either. In the end, it was just entertaining enough where I was entertained without feeling robbed of my time and it ended up just being an average, one-time viewing movie.Hey there, buddy!

139,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,25 March 2014,Children will love it!,"When I saw the trailer for this film, I easily forgot about it. It didn't interest me and I was sure it would be one of those pointless CGI films, aimed at children, that I would never see and never think about again. Well, then it came out and I heard some good things about it. I decided to give it a watch. What I will say is, that although is was kind of a fun film (Plus as a Modern Family fan, I liked that Ty Burrell was the voice of Mr. Peabody), there was nothing in the story to interest me that much. And again, I understand that it is aimed at children and I'm positive that they will love every second of it, but for me I feel I made a bad choice in seeing this film in the first place. If you are a fan of these characters, as they are based on an older cartoon I believe (I don't think I watched it before) then you will probably enjoy this film out of nostalgia reasons at least."
140,Mr. Peabody & Sherman,6,20 March 2014,Okay movie,"So basically ,The story is about a smart dog-Mr.Peabody,who adopt abandoned baby boy named Sherman. The story develop when Sherman go into his first day of school, and was bullied because his father is a dog.Overall, it was an okay movie. some part of the movie are hilarious, and the other part is just okay. you can predict whats gonna happen, and there is no really a climax there. But its still quite fun to see they time traveling and revisited some important people and glorious moment.There are also father son relationship which are quite interesting.Children will enjoy it though, you can take your family to watch it.But overall, it still just an okay movie. 6/10"
