0,ParaNorman,8,27 August 2012,A different kind of animated movie and approach. I really liked it!,"This was a rather surprising movie. It's unlike any other modern  animated movie and picks a new sort of approach, that should work  entertaining for both adults and kids.  There is plenty of 'simple' stuff to enjoy for young kids in this movie  but also the adults shall have no complaints about it. Throughout the  years animated movies often had both stuff for both kids and adults to  enjoy in this movie but I feel that the line dividing the two different  forms of entertainment is getting more and more blurry. Instead the two  things more often get effectively combined, with as a result more and  more movies get released that aren't being too childish for adults or  too mature for little kids. It's being perfect entertainment for just  about everybody!  I do admit though that I was a bit surprised to see how horror  orientated this movie was. Make no mistake about it, this is a horror  movie. It might be a bit frightening for some children but obviously  most shall be perfectly capable of handling it. Fantasy and movies can  be a great outlet and also stimulant for children's imagination, this  also includes horror orientated stuff. After all, most kids are of  course perfectly capable of making a distinction between real stuff and  fantasy.  And I do applaud this movie for not being overly fluffy or careful and  protective toward children. Not that that this is being a completely  dark, or scary, depressing movie to watch but overall it's being a tad  bit more dark and daring than just an average animated movie.  It's really having a style and approach of its own, which just doesn't  goes for its story or the fact that this is being a more genuine horror  flick but also really for its comedy and characters. The characters all  feel rich and very much alive (yes, even the dead characters!) and the  humor is more clever and often dialog orientated, as opposed to having  characters jumping around and falling and bumping into stuff. In that  regard this movie also feels far more mature than just the average  genre attempt.  And another important aspect about an animated movie; it's a really  good looking one! It's using stop-motion techniques and it shows that  this genre is far from outdated or dead. It's really something that  gives the movie an unique look and feel. I don't know, it's perhaps  pleasant that it's being something that allows the movie to feel 'fake'  and true exaggerated fantasy-like, as opposed to CG animated movies,  that are getting more and more smooth and realistic to watch.  It's also a movie with a great underlying message in it, that tells you  it's OK to be different and there is nothing weird or wrong about it  and you shouldn't just judge a book on its cover. It's still too bad  this message was lost on some people and I'm talking about those who  had a problem with its ending. It was perfectly suitable and fitted  perfectly into what this entire movie was trying to tell you for the  first hour and a half.  A surprisingly good movie in about every regard, that above all things  is being perfectly fun and entertaining to watch!  8/10"
1,ParaNorman,9,19 August 2012,Easily One of the Best Movies I've Seen This Year,"I came into ParaNorman with a sense of cautious optimism. I absolutely adore stop motion animation, and I genuinely fell in love with Coraline, LAIKA's previous effort, but the trailers for the film didn't capture my interest in the story in the way I hoped they would and this film also didn't have the benefit of being helmed by the brilliant Henry Selick (Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, Coraline). That being said, I am extremely happy to report that ParaNorman absolutely delivers on every level you could hope for. ParaNorman tells a story about a young boy named Norman who has the unusual ability to see and talk to the dead, an ability which has led him to be ostracized by the other members of his community, including his own family. The New England town in which he lives is famous for a historic witch execution, along with the legend of a curse that the witch put upon those who sentenced her to death. It turns out that the legend of the curse is true, and that Norman, with his ability to talk to the dead, is the only one who can prevent the curse from raising the dead. Unfortunately, Norman is unable to act fast enough and the Witch's curse begins to wreak havoc on the town. ParaNorman is a film with many strengths. Stop motion animation is always a beautiful and fascinating process, and with new technological advances the filmmakers have been able to bring it to a level of detail and expression that are simply astounding. While the scope of the story may be smaller than something like Coraline or Nightmare Before Christmas, the scale of the stop motion sets for this town are truly incredible. The film absolutely immerses you in this world that feels like a living, breathing, place. As beautiful as the animation in Brave was, ParaNorman is easily the most visually impressive film I have seen this year. As beautiful as the film is, it never falls into the trap of so many other animated films by simply being visual spectacle with no narrative soul. The story of the film is fun, intelligent, and heartfelt, and is supported by a great cast of characters. The odd kid who is misunderstood is a common trope in kids' movies, but what makes Norman stand out is that he's never mopey about it. He is ostracized, bullied, and rejected, but he's come to a kind of acceptance about the whole thing. He's certainly not happy about it, but at this point he's not trying to fit in, he's really just trying to keep his head down and get through the daily grind. This is part of what makes his relationship with the other characters in the film work so well. For instance Neil genuinely accepts Norman for who he is and it's obvious that this throws Norman for a loop and he doesn't really know how to interact with someone who ""gets him."" This is never spoken, but it plays out naturally through the performances of the characters. As the narrative progresses it takes some really interesting turns, and at times is genuinely surprising and emotional. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that a large part of the narrative revolves around assumptions and misunderstanding, and it brilliantly uses the audience's assumptions and expectations about the genre and its conventions against them. It's also worth mentioning that this is one of the rare films which decidedly benefits from the addition of 3D. There's some fun play with perspective, and being able to see the dimension that exists in these sets adds a lot to the experience. I genuinely loved ParaNorman and it's easily one of my favorite films this year. It's not a movie for everyone, but if any of the trailers gave you even a glimmer of interest I would definitely recommend checking this one out. LAIKA is certainly beginning to make a name for themselves in the animation scene and I'm really looking forward to whatever their next project will be. I think I still prefer Coraline which definitely benefited from the combination of Neil Gaiman's fantastic story and Henry Selick's experienced hand, but ParaNorman is a truly fantastic film and it's definitely worth a look. A-"
2,ParaNorman,8,6 July 2013,"A lot of fun, but probably not for the young ones","The thing of it is, ParaNorman is pretty scary stuff for a PG movie, so you've been properly warned. This isn't some over-sanitized Disney movie. Everything from the lighting to the characters to the tense plot adds up to something you wouldn't want your six-year-old to drag you to, unless you don't mind paying for some therapy. But it's a terrific movie, with a style all its own and a madcap sense of ghoulish delight.Norman (voice of Kodi Smith-McPhee) is an outcast. Know why? He talks to dead people. And indeed, we see them as well, chatting with our hero along his walk to school. Oh, and his grandmother (voice of Elaine Stritch) talks to him all the time while sitting on the couch in the living room. No one understands poor Norman, who's as resignedly freaked out as Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense, so he has no one to talk to, not his parents (Jeff Garlin and Leslie Mann), not his sister (Anna Kendrick), and not the school bully (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) for sure. It's only when Norman has an episode during the production of a school play (not coincidentally, about an old legend surrounding the town's dark past) that he gains a friend - another outcast, the portly Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), who teaches Norman that it's best not to let people bother you, to not let them get under your skin. Had the story ended there, we may have had a nice, tidy after-school special. Oh, but it does not! From out of almost nowhere, Norman's black-sheep uncle, Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman), a heavily bearded, slightly loony chap, informs Norman that he - Norman! - must take the mantle of He Who Holds Off the Witch's Curse. Mr. P. has been doing it for all these years, but he thinks he's about to go. He warns Norman that it's all up to him and he must read from the book and then he dies. That was an intentional run-on sentence, for your pleasure.Thereby our plot is set in motion! Norman must extricate said book from the dead uncle and then read it by the witch's grave in order to break the curse that no one really believes is real. They don't believe it on account of Mr. Dead Uncle has been reading from the book for his entire life, and someone before him, and so on. But now Dead Uncle is, you know, demised, and just before the witch is to rise from the ashes and wreak havoc! Oh, I should note that the curse goes like this - a little girl was suspected of witchcraft by the town elders and sentenced to death. So you can see why she might want to haunt those elders and the town itself for all eternity.There are people raised from the dead, and the imagery is quite striking; bones, stringy hair, rent clothing, and the ability to remove an appendage and reattach it. Are these - uh - zombies - out to lay waste to the town? Or are they victims of their own device? It's up to Norman, his brain, and his innate ability to talk to dead people to somehow save the day. Despite being grounded, of course.ParaNorman works on many levels. Adults will love the stylish, almost Gothic atmosphere; older teens will love the menace of both the zombies and the townspeople, not to mention the witch herself. There are, for an animated film, plenty of scares and dark themes - slightly offset by the themes of loneliness, friendship, heroism, and getting adults to just listen to you. For once! Ahem. Anyway, there's a sort of beauty in ParaNorman, as horror and light comedy are somehow blended to form a rich animated film."
3,ParaNorman,9,15 August 2012,Another Animated Hit From The Makers Of Coraline!,"Focus Features has only had two animated films up to this point; the beautifully crafted, but story-lacking 9, and of course the gorgeous and creepy Coraline. Now, this studio's third animated film gives us both a funny and creepy story about a town under siege by zombies and an ancient witch's curse. It's one of the best movies of the late summer, and should easily compete for at the Academy Awards for Best Animated Film. The film in itself is split into two sections. The first shows Norman, an out-of-place kid in a small New England town who has the ability to talk to ghosts. Since he has no real friends, he doesn't mind the undead. He's picked on at school for being different, and we see that whenever another person, like the geek Neil, wants to be friends with him, he tries to push them away. Norman's older sister, and Neil's older brother are the stereotypical cheerleader and football jock, and they torment Norman as well. And then we have the school bully; every film seems to have them these days. The second part of the film sees Norman become an unlikely hero after a witch's curse raises the dead back to life and all chaos breaks loose. There are some creepy moments, but the characters are always cracking off one-liners according to the situation, so it kept the film funny as well as adrenaline pumping. The only thing I didn't like about the story was the climax. It's not that I didn't like it, it's just that it felt sort of phoned in. Overall, the voice acting is great, the animation is superb as always, and the 3D remarkably works well. I was expecting a great movie, and I got it with this film. It may be a little too scary for kids under the age of 10, but everyone else should have a blast. I hope this film does well, and I can't wait to see what Focus Feature's next big animated project will be. Final Verdict: 9/10"
4,ParaNorman,10,8 September 2012,Remarkably Endearing,"ParaNorman looks like a throwback to the good old campy stop-motion animated films. The concept may not sound so original, but the designs and the themes of the story are the main appeal here. The movie is fun and wonderful to look at. While it goes through a crazy adventure comedy, there is a surprising twist that made this so endearing. It is something that we don't usually see in an animated film, but because of that we intend to love it. ParaNorman is funny, creepy, smart, and affecting.ParaNorman is oddly different as an animated family film. Unlike the others, this one has a dark and mature context, but by sentimental means. Although the story is about spirits and zombies, the true core of this film is the emotion and the message that it is trying to show us. There's a couple of moments that are quite affecting. Usually is when Norman is being alone in his gloomy life. In other parts, the film is ought to be funny. The comedy sometimes feel way apart from the drama, but they still work anyway.The stop-motion animation indeed looks marvelous. These little figures really brought themselves to life as their voice actors provide their personalities. The campiest part, the zombies, are quite impressive to look at. It's undeniably solid. The music score sure knows which part is suppose to be gloomy, campy, or just ordinary. It's a great effect to the scenes and you'll love it. The rest of the movie is all ridiculous and fun little set pieces that are entertaining enough to enjoy.ParaNorman is surprisingly strong. The depth of the story made this movie so special. It's still filled with comedy and lightheartedness. In the end, it turns out to be endearing. It's a rare kind of family film that is brave to show what it wanted to show. It might be hard for some to understand its sentiment, but if there's anything else why anyone would like this film then it's because of its majestic animation. ParaNorman is simply great and it's easy enough to recommend."
5,ParaNorman,8,26 August 2012,"Packed with wit, imagination and thoughtfulness, this lovingly rendered stop-motion animation is one of the best of the year","A word of caution for parents with younger tots  'Paranorman' might  not go down too well for the faint of heart. But its deliberately  mature- skewing approach is also the reason why this is one of the most  unique animated movies we've seen this year, the latest feat of  stop-motion animation from the same Laika studio artists who had  conjured up the similarly bewitching 'Coraline'.  Both have at their heart titular characters who are outcasts in their  social circle. For Norman, his ability to see ghosts have made him a  pariah among his schoolmates  and the worst of the lot is a  pea-brained nose-picking bully named Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).  Home is not much better. His dad (Jeff Garlin) is none too pleased he  claims to be speaking to his dead grandmother, his mother (Leslie Mann)  dismisses it as a phase, and his bimbotic teenage sister Courtney (Anna  Kendrick) just can't be bothered.   The film's writer is Chris Butler - a storyboard artist who honed his  skills on Tim Burton's 'Corpse Bride' and Henry Selick's 'Coraline' -  and his experience with the contemporaries in quirky animation has  served him well in creating a lovable adolescent misfit in Norman.  Before Norman is even confronted with the challenge you know will turn  him into the unlikely hero, you've already fallen in love with this  sweet unassuming kid with the rectangular quizzical eyebrows and a head  of vertical brown hair.   Instead of sugar-coating the reality of Norman's social life, Butler  states the truth as it is  'You can't stop bullying  it's part of  human nature,"" says Norman's chubby buddy Neil (Tucker Albrizzi),  similarly ostracised in school on account of his size. The honesty is  refreshing, and so is the plot that follows, involving a 300-year old  witch's curse that invokes half-dozen zombies to rise from their graves  and terrorise the local townsfolk of Blithe's Hollow.   A twist late into the tale on the witch's identity makes this an  unexpectedly moving and thoughtful parable on acceptance and empathy,  two morals which tie in beautifully with Norman's own story of  rejection. Along the way to the surprisingly intense finale, Butler and  his co-director Sam Fell inject a veritable sense of fun into the  proceedings which unfold like a roller-coaster ride into a haunted  house of terrors, made all the more enjoyable by Norman's motley crew  comprising of Alvin, Courtney, Neil and Neil's jockish older brother  Mitch (Casey Affleck).   While distracting the younger ones with a cornucopia of visual gags,  Butler packs bits of surprises for the adults in the audience. You'll  chuckle along with the bits of deadpan humour  ""Do you think they'll  eat our brains?"" Alvin screams in fear. ""Yeah, you'll be safe,"" Norman  replies  as well as the 'blink and you'll miss' tributes to horror  classics from 'Halloween' to 'Friday the 13th'. These will be lost on  the kids, but what parents should really take time to explain is  Butler's message of embracing those who are different from us, a lesson  all too precious in today's increasingly xenophobic world.  The same attention to story and character has also gone into the  lovingly-detailed animation  while at first sight cruder looking than  today's more commonly seen computer-generated visuals, the distinctive  stop-motion rendering is nothing short of gorgeous, and one truly  marvels at the amount of effort that has gone into the individual  action-oriented sequences that have so much going on at the same time.  The technique has also allowed the animators to sculpt finer detail  into each of the characters, which come to life in a certain pop-up  fashion that fits perfectly in 3D.   Using the traditional narrative of a misfit turned unlikely hero,  'Paranorman' weaves a fantastically dazzling, consistently engaging and  surprisingly touching story that qualifies it as one of the most  original and certainly one of the best animated movies of the year.  Yes, it isn't as family-friendly as something you might expect from the  usual Disney or Dreamworks fare, but you'll appreciate the level of  maturity and wit that has gone into this impressive stop-motion  animation."
6,ParaNorman,8,3 September 2012,Excellent Animated Movie with Depth,"Without spending too much time discussing the plot, this movie is essentially a film about a misfit kid who ultimately must save the town that has misunderstood and mistreated him for most of his life. Yes, Norman sees dead people. However, everyone is aware of Norman's claim of this power and they either ridicule him (other kids) or are ashamed of his seemingly wild claim and erratic behaviour. Of course Norman's extra-sensory powers will soon be required to rid the town of a curse. The resulting events make for a great story and film.There are several themes in this film that were well developed and ultimately resolved to my satisfaction. The animation is incredible, and I loved the creative camera shots that the director(s) chose in many scenes: much more advanced than the usual animated film. I took 2 children to see this movie, a 6-year old girl and a (near) 4 boy. The kids loved the comedic zombie scenes in particular and were laughing out loud for much of it. They were frightened in other parts but in a functional thematic way, not to the point of nightmares. However I did note that some of the deeper themes went right over the kids' heads, and while they weren't too bothered by this fact, I advise that children over 8 might enjoy the film more fully.The climax of the film is beautifully animated, and very poignant. On the whole a great film. I would state only that the humour surrounding the zombies was hilarious for adults and children alike, and I would have included more of it. Certainly this film is worth the admission. I saw it in 3D, it wasn't mind-blowing 3D but it certainly gave the film more texture."
7,ParaNorman,9,28 August 2012,Pleasant Surprise,"Yes, like most ""kids"" movies, it had it's corny, funny, sometimes just plain silly parts, but... Paranorman left me pleasantly surprised. First and foremost, if you didn't like this movie because you compared it to Caroline, that's your problem. This movie stands well on its own and it's completely unfair to make comparisons. By the time the movie had finished, the beauty of it shone through and, without hesitation, I would say it stands up very well against ""blockbuster"" films designed for mature audiences. It's neither vulgar or obscene, but there are a few parts in the movie that will go straight over the youngster's heads but you will most certainly get it if you're over the age of thirty and haven't been living in a cave. If you take your kid(s) to see this, be ready; there are a few intense scenes that might have them a little frightened. Regarding the poor guy who didn't want to see the Expendables 2, I didn't see it, either, but I sure heard it. They poorly placed this movie the very next theater over from it."
8,ParaNorman,10,2 September 2012,Enter the wonderful strange and creepy world of ParaNorman,"There have been numerous stop motion animation films but only a handful have really stepped up to deliver something special. Coraline was one of those films that delivered unique characters along with a beautifully strange world like no other. Their latest ParaNorman looks to continue this tradition but turning to the ever popular world of zombies and horror. Can it deliver another new unique vision in this style or will it just end up being another generic animated film?ParaNorman follows a misunderstood boy who is able to speak to the dead. When the town is over thrown by zombies, a witches curse, and an angry mob it's up to him to push his abilities to the limit to save them all. This film not only delivers something new and different with an almost played out genre, it manages to stand out and entertain on numerous levels. Featuring an all-star voice cast of Casey Affleck, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Tempestt Bledsoe, John Goodman, Anna Kendrick, Leslie Mann, Christopher Mintz-Plasse who step into their roles and bring these fun characters to creepy life. While this seems to be an animated kid's film, this was clearly made with all ages in mind. There are moments that some would deem not so kid friendly, but still manages to maintain its place among an almost all ages film. The animation is awesome with some strange character and set design that only adds to the originality and fun of this film. This film is formatted like an actual zombie film, but then takes some twists and turns to take it someplace new. The story is dark and fun all at once and will easily keep both adults and kids entertained. There are some classic monster movie moments that adults will appreciate as well as some subject matter that is a bit glossed over, but clearly takes a momentary step out of the family film.This is easily not only one of the best stop-motion films to come along in some time; it's one of the best animated films. ParaNorman delivers in every way filled with comedy, horror, and action all wrapped up in a strange twisted visual tale that you will not soon forget.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey"
9,ParaNorman,7,17 August 2012,"A Zombie Movie for Kids? Well, Maybe....","Nine times out of ten, debating a film's appropriateness for children  is utterly pointless. But in the case of ""ParaNorman,"" a 3D stop-motion  animated film about ghosts, zombies, and a witch's curse, I cannot help  but wonder what age group the filmmakers had in mind. With its morbid  imagery, its broad and occasionally twisted sense of humor, and its  handling of dark issues such as bullying, death, and the execution of  suspected witches, I'm forced to conclude that it may not be  appropriate for anyone under the age of twelve. You, of course, know  your children much better than I do. All I'm asking is that you keep  what I'm saying in mind as you buy tickets  especially if you decide  to shell out the extra cash for a 3D presentation. I should also note  that this is the first PG-rated animated film I know of to include a  gay joke.  If you don't have any children and frankly couldn't care less about the  issue of how young is too young, you may find that ""ParaNorman"" is  wonderful-looking, appropriately scary, and a great deal of fun. For  someone like me, it represents a purer kind of horror movie, in which  the purpose is to frighten and entertain without resorting to tacky  marketing gimmicks like sex, nudity, and relentless gore. It's also not  limited to craft, although that certainly does play a major role; a  real story is being told, and it actually sends a message. I grant you  that it's not a particularly original message, but it's good to hear  nonetheless. Specific scenes are lovingly styled after schlocky B-  movies, while others feature clever insider references. Any dedicated  horror fan will be the first to tell you that the ringtone on the title  character's cell phone is John Carpenter's ""Halloween Theme.""  Taking place in the New England town of Blithe Hollow, where a  notorious history of witch trials are now used to attract tourists, we  meet eleven-year-old Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee), a  zombie movie fanatic cursed with the ability to speak with the dead.  He's surrounded by ghosts, all of which are only visible to him.  Because he always appears to be talking to himself, he's an outcast in  his community. At home, he's berated by his shallow teenage sister  (voiced by Anna Kendrick), patronized by his liberal mother (voiced by  Leslie Mann), and completely misunderstood by his overly stern father  (voiced by Jeff Garlin), who clearly doesn't believe in ghosts. He has  had it up to here with Norman making requests for his grandmother, who  has already died. This is true, but her spirit still lives in the  house, and she and Norman have regular conversations. Despite being  dead, the grandmother (voiced by Elaine Stritch) made a promise that  she would always watch over Norman, which is why she hasn't crossed to  the other side.  At school, Norman is already an easy target for a bully named Alvin  (voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a brute and an idiot. Things only  get worse when he begins having visions, which invade his reality like  rips in the fabric of time. His only friend is Neil (voiced by Tucker  Albrizzi), an innocent and portly boy who takes his daily bullying in  stride and thinks Norman's ability is the coolest thing ever. One day,  they're both approached by the other black sheep of Norman's family:  His uncle Prenderghast (voiced by John Goodman), a hulking bum who  lives holed up in a dilapidated house in the woods. He soon drops dead,  although his spirit visits Norman in the boys' restroom and explains  that his visions are related to a curse put on Blithe Hollow by a witch  centuries earlier. This curse will take effect as soon as the sun goes  down; the only way it can be stopped is if passages from an old book  are read aloud at the witch's gravesite. Norman's sixth sense makes him  the only person qualified to do this.  Inevitably, something goes wrong, and in due time, seven corpses are  awakened from their cemetery slumber. As they lumber around town as  groaning, rotted zombies, Norman, Neil, and Alvin team up with Norman's  sister and the object of her affection, Neil's teenage brother Mitch  (voiced by Casey Affleck), a dimwitted jock. Blithe Hollow's hall of  records is the scene of the finale, where an angry mob gathers on the  steps with pitchforks and torches. The zombies, meanwhile, are inside  and slowly closing in on Norman, who's close to figuring out the  meaning behind the witch's curse. What it really comes down to is  intolerance, ignorance, and the inability to listen to one another in  times of fear and confusion. True enough, these themes are far from  original, but they certainly add depth and even some sweetness to an  otherwise superficial tale of the macabre.  For the most part, the film is in the spirit of fun, walking the fine  line between more mature thrills and family entertainment. There are  select scenes, however, that push the limits of where a PG-rated movie  can and should be allowed to go. The most glaring example is when  Norman must pry a book from the lifeless hands of his uncle  Prenderghast; as he struggles to free the book, the body is flung  around like a ragdoll, and eventually, it falls on top of Norman,  causing a huge length of tongue to roll out of the head and slap Norman  in the face. Had this been a live action film, this scene would have  been disgusting and perhaps even offensive. I believe that many kids  will greatly enjoy ""ParaNorman,"" but I also believe that some of them  will find it frightening. Exercise caution when taking them to the  movies this weekend.  -- Chris Pandolfi"
10,ParaNorman,10,19 August 2012,Wow that was good!,"I love it. It answers the question, what happens when you put THE BREAKFAST CLUB, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and EVIL DEAD in a blender. You get this awesome movie from the makers of CORALINE. In a world dominated by CGI movies, this one is a breath of fresh air (the same applies to the upcoming film FRANKENWEENIE by Tim Burton). We have people with different personalities: the weirdo, the show-off bully, the cheerleader, the not-so-bright jock and the silly geek. Just like THE BREAKFAST CLUB, but they have to get along in order to survive, just like in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Also, a book is involved in it. A book just like in EVIL DEAD. There is a lot of thrills, chills (lots of them), and laughs (splattered (excuse the pun) here and there). Family appropriate? Of course! What do you think? A kid would be caught dead with an R-rated zombie film with over the top gore. It does a great job spoofing the genre. Give it a watch, I recommend it, it might prepare your kids into watching classic horror films (of course you know, viewer discretion is advised). Bottom line: It's good, give it a watch! Rated PG for scary images and some adult references, that might go over the heads of children under 13."
11,ParaNorman,7,2 February 2013,Really enjoyable,"moviestoenjoy.wordpress.comThe makers of Coraline and the beautifully crafted but story-lacking 9 brought us another animated movie that did not disappoint. Paranorman was in fact a surprising movie. Unlike any other animated movie, this one picks a new sort of approach, that would probably entertain both adults and children.The film was shot using a Canon 5D Mark II DSLR Camera. To generate the 3D effect, the camera was mounted on a special rig that would take one shot, then slide to a slightly viewpoint to take another shot. However, to generate all the different faces needed for the characters, the film company Laika used 3D printers.The movie takes place in the creepy town of Blithe Hollow, whose name is a mash up of two other ghost stories, Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit(1945) and Washington Irving's The Legend of The Sleepy Hollow(1949). Paranorman tells the story of 11 years-old Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit- McPhee), who can speak to ghosts. Unfortunately, Norman has no friends because people think he's weird. Even his father (voiced by Jeff Garlin) regrets how his son turned out to be. The movie is a little too horror oriented, but funny and suitable for children nonetheless.The characters are well drawn, so you can understand each of their personalities: you have the nice fat kid called Neil (voiced by Tucker Albrizzi), the usual blonde teen (voiced by Anna Kendrick), the bully (voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and the dumb jock (voiced by Casey Affleck). To be honest, my favorite was Neil.To end with, Paranorman weaves a fantastically dazzling, consistently engaging and touching story. I really appreciated the level of maturity that has gone into this impressive stop-motion animation. A good movie in about every regard, that is fun and entertaining to watch, for both children and adults."
12,ParaNorman,10,19 August 2012,I found it wonderful w/ tons of humor,"The movie gets a ten form me. Considering I love these kind of films. I know a lot of folks feel this movie might not be geared towards children under 9. I'm far from a prune, but I would not take a five year old but.............. then again, I've watch children and they are much smarter than we give them credit for. so point? Judge for yourself. There were kids in the theater that appear to be about five-ish or seven- ish and they knew when to laugh and really enjoyed themselves. So again if it just you you will love it. If you have kids under nine It would have to be on you to decide. but I hardly think this movie will turn your kid in to a thug, or the devil spawns. It a good movie."
13,ParaNorman,8,25 April 2013,Funny with Great Message,"In Blithe Hollow, the outcast boy Norman Babcock lives with his father Perry, his mother Sandra and his teenage sister Courtney. Norman is considered a freak by his schoolmates since he speaks to the dead, including his grandmother that watches horror movies on television with him. However nobody believes that Norman has this ability besides his fat friend Neil. Norman's deranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast meets Norman and tells that he must protect Blithe Hollow from the witch curse. Soon Mr. Prenderghast dies and his ghost explains to Norman that he should get his book and perform a ritual in the witch's grave. Norman finds the book that is a fairytale and then he goes to the seven graves where the men that condemned the witch are buried. However, Norman is interrupted by the school bully Alvin and the dead arise and invade the town. Soon Norman has a dream and finds that the witch is the girl Agatha that was sentenced to death in 1712 due to her medium ability. Now Norman wants to convince Agatha that her revenge is turning her equal to those who killed her. ""Paranorman"" is a stop-motion animation with a very funny supernatural story. Norman speaking with his grandma in the beginning and Mitch telling to Courtney that he has a boyfriend in the end are hilarious. The story has also a great message against the prejudice and ignorance. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Paranorman"""
14,ParaNorman,10,30 August 2012,"Laika,stop-motion's Pixar","Why is Laika, the studio that has made Coraline and now ParaNorman, ""Stop-motion's Pixar"" ? Because after Coraline's perfect trip through fear and loneliness, it is time for Norman to impress us all ! Just like in Coraline, the stop-motion animation is gorgeous and dazzling. The characters are all beautifully animated and everything feels alive, unlike CGI movies that sometimes may look cold (I'm especially thinking about Dreamworks movies). The story of ParaNorman seemed a bit like a great-fun tribute to cheesy B-movies with funny characters. Well, it is by far better than this. The characters are deeper than I expected. And the last 30 minutes are incredibly surprising, thanks to a well-made twist unrevealed in trailers (which is really unusual nowadays) that leads to a fantastic, poetic and even sad climax. I'd say the final fight is the best of the year, by far.To sum up, ParaNorman is a poetic, sometimes frightening and funny animation movie that everybody has to watch. It is at least as good as Pixar's best films, and I'm already waiting for the day ParaNorman will win an Oscar."
15,ParaNorman,8,16 August 2012,Dead & Lovely,"I recently watched again, and reviewed here, MONSTER HOUSE, which is, like PARANORMAN, an animated horror movie for kids (actually, both feature as main character a boy who has a fat-and-funny friend). I'm not sure if MONSTER HOUSE appeared in the great Fangoria magazine, but PARANORMAN did. I was already interested in watching it on the big screen when I found out the Fangoria coverage, which was just the plus. I was interested for the obvious reason: stop-motion material from the people responsible of CORALINE (not Henry Selick tough). This is clearly the sort-of little stop-motion film of year (and I said sort-of little since it had a pretty big publicity campaign here in Mexico City) while Tim Burton's upcoming FRANKENWEENIE is like the big and long-awaited one.There is some good news. While we wait to found out if Burton finally does something great after almost 10 years, here we have a film that will give movie geeks really cool stuff. Needless to say, kids won't enjoy some of the elements that most likely you will, fellow reader. Well, you will if you're into very cool horror tributes, in the way Quentin Tarantino would be proud, and nice takes on witch-hunt and into zombies, of course. Talking about the zombies here, well, I recalled what Guillermo Del Toro's said about CRONOS; he said basically that the vampire from his film is like the saddest vampire ever. I won't say much, only that here we can think in the zombies as sad and confused human beings. The main character Norman is not the classic happy kid as well; you'll love him by just seeing his liking for horror  actually, not every day we have an animated movie that opens like something out of a Grindhouse. And there's good humor (and McLovin as a bully with stretched piercing  I watched the 2D Spanish dubbed version tough), so yes, it's worth watching! *Watched it on 08 August, 2012"
16,ParaNorman,4,24 December 2012,How to bludgeon your kids with a message,"ParaNorman is a movie with a message. That message is Listening to Others is good. Fair enough. Good Message. But this movie isn't good. It's lousy. It hits you over the head with the message that no one listens to poor Norman and Norman doesn't listen to other people... in the first ten minutes. It then proceeds to reinforce that message by clubbing you upside the skull every couple of minutes with further examples of failed communication, inattentive parents & teachers, and over the top mockery.The movie also makes a stand against reactionary mob mentality, both in the 300 year old judicial murder of the 11 year old ""witch"" of town fame and the modern townsfolk's panic at the rise of 7 zombies who hurt absolutely no one. And why does all this happen? Because no one is Listening! Weren't you listening? That said, the humor isn't funny, the acting isn't interesting, and the visuals? meh. They look like Jimmy Neutron, but less so."
17,ParaNorman,9,22 August 2012,One of the best films of the year,"I am 33 y/o and a long time horror fan and I absolutely loved this film. Yes the film looks wonderful and the execution is awe inspiring, yes the story of Norman brought tears to my eyes a few times, yes I jumped a few times and yes I think this is one of the best films of the year! The film centers on a young boy named Norman who has a special gift that allows him to see and communicate with ghosts. He has a bad reputation in his small town famous for burning a witch at the stake over a century ago. He's bullied constantly because he's different and even his family doesn't take him seriously. He's a big horror movie fan especially zombie films and on the eve of the burning's anniversary he is contacted by a smelly homeless guy who he finds out shares his gifts. Unfortunately the man passes away and he is made aware of his responsibilities in the town. Since he's able to communicate with the paranormals he is to read from a special book at the witch's gravesite before the sun sets so that he can prevent her curse from becoming realized. Something obviously goes awry and the curse begins as the bodies of the people that slain her rise. And it's only up to Norman to save the day before the town goes crazy. ParaNorman is such a great film. Besides being a visual marvel the films explores deeper and more prevalent subject matter including bullying, being scared, handling prejudice if your different, the acceptance of parents and the acceptance of ones self, How people who are scared make bad decisions sometimes, the acceptance of different people, and the devastating effects of how reacting negatively to negative actions only make matters worse. I know it may sound somewhat trivial to an extent or even childish but all of the lessons in this film can spill over into so many aspects of everyones life. In that alone it is completely relatable to everyone. The voice work from Kodi Smit-Mcphee, Anna Kendrick, Casey Affleck and Christopher Mintz amongst others is inspired as well as the accomplished direction that fuses genre staples with a light hearted family film to near perfection. Also I'd like to praise the film makers for taking an innocent and appreciated step into full acceptance of everyones lifestyles (you'll know what I'm talking about when the film ends) and the clever nods towards the horror genre that made me feel like a big kid again. The same company who executed the small but over rated hit Coraline present this as well. But the work here is far better, the film is much more engaging and easily relatable and I didn't fall asleep in this film. ParaNorman is a true instant classic. A gateway film for younger fans wanting to explore the genre and a great, smart, funny, entertaining film and one of the best of the year! 4.5/5"
18,ParaNorman,10,16 August 2012,quite an interesting animation movie with everything fun to entertain,"After seeing many low quality animation movies recently, Laika has made a masterpiece with Paranorman.I was anticipating this movie for a long time and it exceeded my expectations at a great extense. Laika is one of the best animation picture companies bringing innovations to this genre of movies rather than using old-fashioned and conventional methods to make movies. You see the cinematic difference all throughout this superb fun to watch movie. The story of this movie may sound a bit awkward but it is quite captivating throughout. It was my first experience ever to wait till the credits rolled to pay my appreciation to every single counterparts of this movie. The story is pretty much about a picked on and friendless kid who is becoming the hero of his town when a curse breaks loose in his small New England town.I enjoyed every single minute of this movie trying to see what Laika did differently than other companies could have done. If you are a huge fan of animation movies and also love 3D pictures go and see this movie. I give 10 out of 10 for this whimsical movie. Everything was up to par.It was fun to see the character development which was unorthodox and one-liners being cracked off by every single character in the movie was meticulous. The main character reminded me of the kid in the movie up of last year. I loved the cinematic aspect, too. Nothing really fell short of humor. I also liked the music.Everything was pair as a square! go and see this movie this weekend , you will be leaving the auditorium with a great smile. Watching a bad movie and leaving the auditorium with apprehension was my personal problem but Paranorman was terrific and made me smile till i drove back home ."
19,ParaNorman,2,30 December 2012,"A frightful blend of humorless, grotesque characters propelled by a derivative zombie horror plot","Paranorman, the new stop action animated horror comedy, comes from the creators of Coraline, the 1999 Alice in Wonderland-like stop action animated feature, which garnered fairly good reviews. I faulted Coraline for its lack of originality and characters that didn't have enough charm. I'm sad to report that Paranorman represents a big step backward for the creators of Coraline, as it's much more derivative than its precursor and manages to exude significantly less charm.The film starts off nicely as we slowly pan through the town of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts, which reminds one of a working-class section of Boston or any of those eastern or central Massachusetts towns that happen to feature rows of houses built in the 20s and 30s. We meet the film's protagonist, Norman Babcock, a boy with psychic powers who can communicate with his deceased grandmother inside the house as well as numerous ghosts out on the street. Norman is one of those 'misunderstood' kids who's ridiculed at school as a freak and forms a friendship with another outcast at school, Neil, an overweight kid, who is also constantly bullied.In 'Coraline', most of the characters were eccentric but in 'Paranorman', except mainly for Norman and Neil, all the other characters, who are supposed to be funny, are actually either grotesque, mean-spirited or ignorant (some all of the above). The film's animators chose to highlight all the characters' negative attributes by exaggerating their physical deficiencies. For example, Norman's father, Perry, has an enormously protruding pot belly. He's also entirely unsympathetic as he considers his son's interest in psychic phenomena, an embarrassment to the family as well as the community at large. The Paranorman scenarists also fail to get any laughs from Norman's sister Courtney, who proves to be a caricature of a narcissistic teenager who's desperate to find a boyfriend. At the end of picture, we're supposed to laugh when she's rejected by Neil's older flat-topped, super-buffed Ron Howard looking brother, Mitch, who turns out to be gay.Today it seems whenever we have a story about a young outcast, he'll always be pitted against a school bully. In this case it's Alvin, who sports a pig-like face and bears a faint resemblance to Bruce Willis. The obnoxious Alvin attempts to torment sensitive Norman until he realizes that everything his opponent is saying about a witch's curse that may destroy the town, comes true. Mrs. Henscher, the schoolteacher, is fairly amusing when she attempts to convince her school kids to emote better while they're performing a play about the 300th anniversary of the town, but later turns ugly (sporting a mud cake facial), joining a mob full of vengeful townspeople, who riot when faced with a group of hapless Zombies. There's also Sheriff Hooper, the overzealous police officer who thinks of shooting first and asking questions later (as the only African-American, some folks may find this character overly stereotypical).Saving the worst character for last is Norman's deranged uncle, Mr. Prenderghast, who lives on the edge of town and resembles the town drunk--an individual who everyone in the town tries to avoid. Before Prenderghast has a heart attack and dies, he explains that the town is cursed by a little girl who was hung as a witch and took revenge on the seven Puritan townspeople from 300 years ago, who sentenced her to death. In an awfully tasteless scene, after Prenderghast kicks the bucket, rigor mortis sets in and the lifeless, stiff body falls on little Norman--who must extricate himself, not before being licked by the corpse's loose and gross, saliva-filled tongue.In addition to all the unlikeable and charmless characters, there's also the amazingly derivative story line. Without the so-called comedy, 'Paranorman' would just be your average Zombie movie. The twist is that Paranorman cops out by becoming completely sentimental. The Zombies were not originally a hate-filled mob who sentenced poor little Agatha to death--they were merely 'afraid'. And now Norman points out, the mob full of Blithe Hollow denizens, have becomes just as bad as their cowering ancestors.Norman ends up by making everything right by engaging in a 'heart-to-heart' with the now demented and vengeful little Agatha. Once Norman gets through to Agatha, the souls of the seven Zombies, finally make it to their eternal resting spots (along with of course, little Agatha) and Norman's family and the rest of the town, learn an important lesson about being tolerant of kids with extra sensory abilities as well as Zombies who were not actually hate-crazed bigots, but merely innocently caught up in the mass hysteria of their times.Now all that's left is to figure out how this hopeless production became a hit. Well, of course there are all those kids into zombie movies; but what about the critics? Sadly, many of the critics have the sensibilities of all those kids who bought the tickets. Alas, little Agatha is no more. If only Norman could have directed her to have those knuckleheads (aka 'the critics') give 'Paranorman', the rating it deserved. It looks like Metacritic's completely misguided '72', will remain Paranorman's ultimate final composite rating, for all eternity!"
20,ParaNorman,10,25 August 2012,"Pro Healing, Pro Courage, Pro Forgiveness, Pro Spiritual, Pro Witch, Pro Gay, Pro Paranormal!","This is, by far, the best film of 2012! Towards the end, tears were coming to my eyes! What a incredibly pleasant surprise!I have to admit that I was concerned that ParaNorman would lead to insulting or trivializing the Wiccan/Pagan/Spiritualist/Paranormal community! But just the opposite happened! While maintaining a steady sense of humor from beginning to end ParaNorman is a many layered, very profound movie, that, quite frankly, is a masterpiece! The only movie as of August 2012 that I will purchase this year to add to my film collection! If you are Pro Healing, Pro Courage, Pro Forgiveness, Pro Spiritual, Pro Witch, Pro Gay, and Pro Paranormal, like I am, then make sure you see this film before it leaves the theaters. Films this good don't usually last in mainstream theaters for very long. For example, the only other great film that I've seen this year, ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" has been showing only on single screen in the Baltimore City & County, an area of over a million people! Thank you Hollywood for sticking your neck out by making a movie for grown-ups, while at the same time making a film you can take the entire family to see!"
21,ParaNorman,5,14 August 2012,What a disappointment!,"The movie starts out great - this little kid can see and talk to ghosts. He passes and talks to at least ten on his way to school, then, for some reason, this plot point is discarded. He sees a ghost dog and gets important plot information from a ghostly relative (it's almost like to whole 'sees ghosts thing' was a set up to enable this vital plot point.). No more ghosts. The plot now switches to a witch's curse and zombies. Very funny zombies and a very scary witch-like apparition in the sky. But then the whole tone of the movie changes. The zombies are the victims, the witch is - well, I won't give that away. Let's just say the final act gets sentimental and serious and drags the whole movie down. Too bad - there are some very funny characters and some beautiful animation. The 3D is well done."
22,ParaNorman,3,1 January 2013,i think it doesn't worth the trouble to go see it,"it isn't for kids (at all). it is lousy as a scary movie, lousy as a cartoon. not even funny. it should be at least over 12. not worth the money and the trouble to go see it. the story might have had a better approach by making it a bit more funny. it is grim and sad and my kid wouldn't have surely lasted until the end. of course, it might have given him some bad dreams. the scene with the dead uncle and the book is surpassing any definition of disgusting (i wonder it it was to be scary or funny in the director's/maker's intention?). Coraline was as grin as this, but at least it gave this strange world sensation and ... well, again, it is not a movie for kids. it isn't nice at all, and it completely failed to catch me at all"
23,ParaNorman,2,30 October 2012,Its like Mental Junk-Food,"ParaNorman is like junk-food, at first glance it looks good and initially taste good, but you feel bad after ingesting it! This is in contrast to the typical Pixar films,where as you walk away feeling good. Movie has dark and foreboding undertone. Storyline engages with societal taboos' which gave many people discomfort and/or initiates a reflexive ""yuck"" reaction. Adult at best, recommend parents not take their children to see it. Movie falls in the not too uncommon nether region of marginalization. Its neither an appropriate kids movie or a really appealing adult animation. This is typical of animations associated with Henry Selick or Niel Gaiman."
24,ParaNorman,6,30 January 2013,A cut above the norm for this type of kid venture but not worth quite the critical rave it's received.,"'PARANORMAN': Three Stars (Out of Five)An Academy Award nominee for Best Animated Feature Film (of 2012), and one of the better reviewed movies of the year, this stop-motion animated film tells the story of a boy who can communicate with dead people who's called on to save his town from a 300-year old curse. The film was written and co-directed (along with Sam Fell) by Chris Butler. Butler worked on the storyboards for other spooky animated films like 'CORALINE' and 'CORPSE BRIDE'. This marks his feature film directing and writing debut. The film was produced over the course of three years at a studio in Hillsboro, Oregon and is the first stop-motion animated film to use a 3D color printer to create it's character's faces (and the second to be shot in 3D). The voice cast includes the likes of Kodi Smit-McPhee (of 'LET ME IN' and 'THE ROAD' fame), Anna Kendrick, Casey Affleck, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Leslie Mann, Jeff Garlin and John Goodman. I found the film to be a cut above the norm for this type of kid venture but not worth quite the critical rave it's received. The film revolves around a boy by the name of Norman Babcock (Smit-McPhee) who is gifted with the ability of being able to speak to dead people. His family and other townsfolk in the small town of Blithe Hollow don't believe he can really communicate with spirits though and he's seen and treated as an outcast freak. A fellow classmate, who's also an outcast named Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), is the only one who believes Norman, along with Norman's uncle Mr. Prenderghast (Goodman). Mr. Prenderghast calls on Norman, one day, to protect the town from a 300-year old curse. Norman is informed that the curse was cast by a witch centuries ago and will bring about the living dead. Norman is reluctant to believe his uncle until zombies start walking the streets and it truly is up to Norman to use his special powers to save the day. I have a hard time getting in to animated kid's films like this (especially stop-motion ones). Usually due to the fact that these films are all filled with one-dimensional characters and lame kid friendly jokes. This movie definitely has it's fair share of both these things but it also has a little more character and emotional depth than most animated films of this type. It also plays some good homage to monster films and has a nice retro feel to it (at times). The music is spectacular and it is a little more creepy and mature than you might expect from the trailers. It also has been praised (as well as condemned) for having the first openly gay character in a kid's film (which I think is a very good thing). The movie still has it's flaws and it isn't as cool as critics make it out to be but it is a decent, better than average animated kid's film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yq7kwUUDQ"
25,ParaNorman,4,10 January 2013,"A Quick, Nutshell Opinion of ""Paranorman""","Paranorman, the new stop motion animated film from Laika Studios is an intriguing idea for a film that always falls just shy of its premise thanks to a lackluster script and some occasionally jerky animation. The film follows Norman, a lonely boy who can see and talk to ghosts. When a Witch's Curse from back in the Puritan days brings zombies back to life roaming Norman's town, it's up to Norman to save the day. The best parts of the film are the jokes making stabs at classic horror film clichés, such as the zombies being afraid of the humans trying to kill them, rather than the other way around. As well, the examination of bullying and its effects on children is handled fairly well through Norman's journey in the film, but where the film falls short is in all of the two-dimensional characters that surround Norman. All of the characters that surround Norman are Hollywood movie clichés, the jock, the bully, the dumb girl, etc. Then, add on to the fact that the animation of the characters is often jerky, looking as if the animators forgot to animate a few key frames, which in stop motion animation can be headache inducing, and you have a so-so film.I give Paranorman a 4 out of 10!"
26,ParaNorman,,7 January 2013,Tedious.,"I suppose this just isn't my kind of movie. I didn't care for Coraline either. While the animation is really good, as we have come to expect nowadays, and the voice-acting is first-rate, I just got really tired of watching ghosts chasing the boy during most of the middle of the movie.I suppose my best synopsis is ""tedious."" It lasts for about 90 minutes but I found myself thinking it would have made a really good 30-minute movie.I suppose my other issue is that ghost stories with children being able to see ghosts has become tiresome to me.A free DVD loan from my public library."
27,ParaNorman,5,8 October 2012,uneven but bags of fun!,"Paranorman tells the tale of Norman, who is afflicted with the strange 'power' of being able to see and talk to the dead. His local town is one full of legends and curses and with the help of a few semi-friends Norman is the only who can save it from a (not so) wicked witch.Paranorman isn't quite a kiddie film. Sure, kids will enjoy the animation and a few of the more obvious physical jokes but the subject matter and tone of the film is a little too grown up. Lacking in Pixars fun and joviality Paranorman skirts off piste much like its well meaning but odd central character. Some kids wont get of the more subtle jokes or references (itchy weiners and the music) and i still find it strange that they made a kids film about zombies! I had the same feeling watching Monster House a couple of years back. Much like Paranorman, Monster House is bags of fun and its message is one that i really appreciate but i felt that it didn't need to be as grimmly told."
28,ParaNorman,8,26 August 2012,"The animation is utterly gorgeous, but I do think the script could have been a bit better","This horror-themed stop-motion flick is in the tradition of The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline, though it wasn't directed by Henry Selick (it is from the same studio as Coraline and The Corpse Bride, Laika). It reminded me a lot of last year's Rango in that I liked it a lot, and really fell in love with its world, but I thought there was something lacking in the script. The animation is truly gorgeous, at least every bit as good as Coraline. The characters are beautifully designed and realized - even the writing behind them is quite good. The script as a whole, though... First off, much like Rango, this is primarily a comedy film, but the gags pretty much universally fall flat. The drama of the film, which involves the constantly bullied Norman using the gifts that make him abnormal to save the day, is a welcome theme, but it often comes off as heavy-handed. My favorite character was Norman's shallow teenage sister. She's well performed by Anna Kendrick, but it's the animation and design that really brought her to life (especially love the lip gloss - the detail in this film is really amazing). I'd still highly recommend this and rate it highly, even though I was a tad disappointed (of course I was expecting the second coming of Coraline - I guess I'll have to get my expectations stepped on again in a month or so when Frankenweenie is released!)."
29,ParaNorman,5,19 August 2012,"Testing the boundaries, I see.","It was OK. My kids were in awe the whole time. Good and bad awe. The plot was nice and I liked it, but there where several things that concerned me and even my kids. (13, 8, and 6) It had a lot of adult content. We were quite disappointed in the Disney Channel advertisement, yet it was a TNT or USA channel type movie. The boundaries are definitely being pushed with this one. It wasn't a waste of money, but it was not a movie I would let them see again...for a very long time. A lot of families left after this movie, and it was the first of a double feature. I shake my finger and head on this one people."
30,ParaNorman,9,24 September 2012,Paranorman Review,"The movie is about finding yourself and being more tolerant towards people that are different in opinion or appearance than you. Great messages that have been done a dozen time before, but there is nothing wrong with that. The film is also an homage and parody to classic horror movies. From making fun of their structure to embracing it for laughs, the movie does a great job of being original while not forgetting its roots.""Paranorman"" is very well directed. It is a stable for stop-motion films and what is possible with the medium. From impressive camera angles and shots to the fluidity of motion on the character, I almost thought I was watching a CGI film. The directors also do a great job of throwing you a curve ball. Right when you think were the movie is headed something happens and it is a pleasant surprise keeping you on your toes. The film starts off slow, but gradually gets better and it concludes with an epic ending, filled with great animation, effects, and music Writing is fairly strong, some of the jokes don't work, but they are far and in between.Characters are mostly archetypes of characters that have been done before. However, they are still funny and charming throughout the film. Norman is the main character, who has a hard time fitting in. However we can relate to him, but he has this annoying character trait about him that can me grating. He seems isolate himself so much that even when someone wants to be his friend, he pushes them away. Neil is Norman's friend and the comic relief of the films, however he does bring some heart to the table. Courtney is Normans sister and the typical valley girl, who only thinks about being popular and guys. She's good, but not one of the more memorable characters. Alvin is the bully, he has his moments. Mitch is Neil's brother and probably the most hilarious part of the movie. The zombies are funny too, but don't have a unique personality. Overall the characters are good and fill in their archetypes well, while still bringing some original personality.Animation is gorgeous in this film. Each character moves so fluidly, it felt as if I was watching a CGI film. The overall look of the film is charming and brings back some nostalgia. The musical score is great. Starts of very subtle, but is amazing near the end with the visual effects. This film is a stable in terms of its animation for stop-motion films.Overall ""Paranorman"" is a fantastic movie, the best animated movie of the year and in my opinion the best stop-motion movie I've ever seen. Sure the characters and the story are sort of generic, but the directors know how to through a curve ball into the mix and keep the audience on their toes. The conclusion is brilliant and I love how they throw in something new for a character in the end. I give it a 4.5/5, fantastic animation, surprising twists, and great musical score.""Fetch Status"""
31,ParaNorman,5,15 September 2012,I Expected More,"The first of three hotly anticipated horror/comedy/stop motion kids films we'll see in the coming weeks and coming three years after Laika's success with Coraline, ParaNorman begins with a flourish which sets it up to be an interesting and funny family film. Unfortunately it runs out of steam after about fifty minutes when the jokes dry up and the predictable plot takes over from what had been a fun, film which takes a surprisingly candid look at death.The world of ParaNorman is very well animated and in a similar style to Coraline, only this time in colour. I'm a huge fan of stop motion but I like the Ray Harryhausen or Arden style where you can actually see thumb prints and the design process. It's an odd criticism but for me the animation is a little too neat and smooth. One of the great benefits stop motion has over GCI or hand drawn cartoons is that it is extremely adaptable and movements should show that. When animation and effects are of the standard of ParaNorman it makes me wonder why stop motion puppets were used in the first place.The opening half especially is littered with witty jokes and references to the likes of Dawn of the Dead, The Exorcist and Friday the 13th for the parents while the kids could enjoy sight gags and the odd joke which only the children in the audience found funny. The 'stopping a curse with a band of unlikely heroes' plot was a bit naff and provided nothing new or particularly exciting except for one thing. I really liked the zombie's arc and though I won't spoil it, it's the narrative highlight of the film. There is one other surprise line late on which got some laughs and will no doubt draw some attention from the Christian Right but everything else is formulaic and re-hashed. I don't know if it is a response to the film or the fault of a Saturday lunchtime screening but by the half way mark it wasn't only the children in the audience who were starting to fidget and a father and son in the row in front both fell asleep and snored loudly through the final third. Both my girlfriend and I also needed a nap when we got home. That's not really a ringing endorsement.The cast is large and talented and you will be able to recognise several well known actors but due to the nature of the script no one really stands out. An area I did enjoy was the soundtrack/score. Music was used sparingly in the film but when it was it worked really well. There was a sort of Nicolas Winding Refn style electro score which was surprising to hear and I was also delighted to hear rapper Dizzee Rascal's Fix Up, Look Sharp get a brief airing. The credits roll over The White Stripes Little Ghost which I'd happily listen to any day.Overall ParaNorman is a film with a strong beginning, poor middle and dull end. It is funny at times and the animation is good but I'm expecting more from Frankenweenie and Hotel Transylvania.www.attheback.blogspot.com"
32,ParaNorman,10,10 September 2013,Fantastically done,"Agatha the angry ghost is magnificent. This whole movie is. The animation is amazing and the story will warm and break your heart. Good for those who love Burton and Selick, or just have a good imagination and a love for films. Unfortunately, I've heard a lot of parents say it was too scary and/or inappropriate for their children. To each their own. But for me, if your kids can't handle this, they're most likely too sheltered and scare too easily. Anything about this movie that adults deem inappropriate, kids won't even understand until they get older. This movie teaches an important lesson, and one even some adults need to re-learn."
33,ParaNorman,10,8 August 2013,"A deep, thoughtful and exciting experience","2012 was an amazing year for animation. I absolutely loved Wreck-it- Ralph, Brave, Hotel Transylvania, Frankenweenie, Rise of the Guardians and even the not so loved Ice Age 4. ParaNorman is another fantastic film in the 2012 animation category. I'd rank it my 3rd favorite from the 2012 animation list.This film came at a time when zombies are at their most popular in TV and cinema. However this film takes a zombie story and gives it a great twist and depth in its storytelling with meaningful and heartbreaking themes applicable in today's society. It has some pretty resonating messages about understanding, ignorance, bullying, bigotry, friendship and family and love. The anti-bullying messages are great and hopefully will register with our youth. All these messages are interspersed in a very much original story with sweetness and humor. Though at times the humor does get a bit PG and higher. So parental guidance is advised. It is a very mature story. Mature in that the humor can get a bit non-kid friendly with references to sex and to an adult film store, the F word and some more. So in this regard parental guidance is suggested but for teen and adult viewing, it is a fantastic film with perfect blend of storytelling, great messages, emotions and humor.The film is very different from what we've seen and yet so familiar, i say that in a very good way. Essentially it has few minor elements of Ghost Whisperer, Scooby Doo on Zombie Island, Scooby Doo and the Witchs's Ghost, The Sixth Sense and more Scooby Doo and merges them into one but in addition it adds a lot and i mean a lot more to make quite an original story. See the mentioned films above and you will notice elements reminiscent of in this film. This film also is very witty with a lot of ironies and it parodies stereotypes in modern society which add to its humor. There were also references to some films of the horror genre of which i am not a fan but still caught a few.The stop motion animation is very well done and is very lovely. The stop motion is excellent, colorful and has a large degree of detail.Some people say it has dark themes, well personally if you watched Hocus Pocus as a kid and loved it, then you are sure to love this one since they have a lot of similarities."
34,ParaNorman,10,22 April 2017,Best Stop Motion Movie of All Time,"This movie really introduced me to Laika; even though I had seen Coraline earlier, this was the movie that had me doing research.Norman represents every kid with a weird talent or hobby in a small town. He's literally ostracized by an entire town, including his own father, yet he understands that some people just don't have the mental capacity to not fear something different. He's told to not be a freak or weirdo by people who don't even bother to learn about him. He's the Harry Potter of this town of Dursley's.Dealing with death, hopelessness, bullying, and forgiveness/acceptance, this movie creates a real world of monsters and ghosts. It presents a movie where the true evil is bigotry, bystanders, and herd mentality. It's the 13 Reasons of 2012, yet flew under the radar. A girl was murdered, cursed the town, and in the end, is set free by realizing that scared fools make rash decisions, and by being hateful and angry, she became a fool herself.I give it a 10 out of 10, because it presents a kid who doesn't have to be a hero to a bunch of jerks (who don't even learn a lesson outside the dad) but he does, because he's a good person. There's no reward or admiration, he just gets a friend and father who no longer hates him. The real, underwhelming, reality of being a hero."
35,ParaNorman,5,26 September 2012,Child-friendly #horror that gains in #animation what it loses on plot.,"It turns out that sometimes my iPhone ap gets it wrong. This should have been Dredd but somebody doesn't know the difference between 7.30 and 8.30. And so it fell to Paranorman to entertain me.So did he? Well, with some reservation, yes.The first of the new crop of kiddie horror animations (keep an eye out for Hotel Transylvania, and Tim Burton's Frankenweenie), Paranorman is the simple story of Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit-McPhee) a lonely, misunderstood boy with jug ears and the ability to see dead people. His paranormal abilities (can you see what they did there?) has earned him the disdain of his family and peers, with the exception of the fat kid, Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), who's a bigger punch bag than Norman and sees a fellow loner in Norman.As their operatically screeching, narcissistic teacher rehearses them in the school play about the Blithe Hollow's founding fathers, Norman discovers an ancient witch's curse is about to let rip once again and raise a (small) herd of zombies from the town cemetery. And Norman is the only one taking the matter seriously.Much, no, most of the animations is beautiful. Each character is beautifully ugly with upturned noses, bulbous ears, dented faces or, in the case of Norman's parents, bellies that almost duel with each other. Paranorman's sets are fantastic, falling somewhere between those of Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and features the best use of loo roll on film. A wonderful moment.Paranorman boasts an impressive line up of vocal talent with Smit-McPhee (The Road) more than holding his own against the beautifully expressive Anna Kendrick (Up In the Air), Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Kick-Ass). There are a couple of unexpected surprises in the voice acting with Bernard Hill groaning for England as the judge and John Goodman impersonating Albert Finney and having huge fun as Mr Prenderghast.So, yes, there are many high points and there's a great deal to enjoy but it isn't quite enough. My attention wandered and that had nothing to do with the audience on this occasion, of which I constituted precisely a third, but rests entirely with writer and co-director Chris Butler. There seems little that is original in Paranorman or, at least hasn't been delivered with more panache elsewhere. There are no great moments of humour and, sitting here reviewing it the morning after, there are no real stand-out moments that spring to mind. Even the dialogue has been borrowed and rehashed in places: ""I like to be alone."" ""So do I. Let's do it together."" Name that film! More than anything, Paranorman feels stilted and never manages to be as absorbing as The Nightmare Before Christmas or even Coraline. If this is the first of many child-friendly horrors this year, I sincerely hope this is merely a slightly stale aperitif before the main course of Frankenweenie. Surely Burton can't continue his downward slide forever.As a postscript, both to the film and my review, if you've already watched Paranorman and left before the credits, shame on you! If you haven't seen it yet, be patient. As the final name scrolls past, there is a lovely little featurette, Making Norman, that is an absolute joy and easily matches anything Pixar produces."
36,ParaNorman,7,6 September 2012,ParaNorman...3 out of 4 Skittles,"Laika Entertainment, the stop-motion studio behind the modern classics Corpse Bride and Coraline, are back with their latest spooky tale, ParaNorman. Like its predecessors, ParaNorman is a beautiful claymation wonder. Every single frame is filled with such a vast amount of detail it would take several repeat views to catch all the hidden gems.ParaNorman is also filled with humor. The talented voice actors that bring the clay characters to life provide most of the laughs. From Anna Kendrick's (Up In The Air, 50/50) ditzy cheerleader, to Casey Affleck's (Gone Baby Gone, Ocean's Eleven) dumb jock, to Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, Kick-Ass) getting to play against his 'McLovin' typecast as the angry school bully. But the biggest laughs by far are dished out by child actor Tucker Albrizzi who is perfectly cast as the voice of Norman's chubby best friend, Neil.ParaNorman is a visual and comedic force. Despite the tedious and demanding workload and easier computer rendering technology, Laika Entertainment continues the tradition of making stop-motion movies the hard way. With films as stunning as ParaNorman hopefully the technique will live on forever."
37,ParaNorman,8,24 August 2012,Excellent animated movie to nearly (not officially) end the summer movie season.,"I had pretty high expectations going into ParaNorman, the new stop-motion animated film from the makers of Coraline. I thought the movie looked very good from the trailers and it looked like that this would be a very good one to nearly close the summer movie season up. And, I was totally right. I actually thought ParaNorman was more than just good; it was excellent, funny, and wickedly entertaining.STORY: ParaNorman follows a kid named Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee of Let Me In), who's family doesn't really care about him. Also, he has the ability to speak to the dead, and nearly no one believes in him about his ability. One day, he meets his eccentric uncle (John Goodman), who tells him that he must save his own city by taking on ghosts, zombies, and grown-ups in order to get rid of a curse which was cast centuries ago by a witch.MY THOUGHTS: The stop-motion animation in this was simply wonderful to look at. The setting, the characters, and the look of the film were literally spot-on. The characters were really likable, funny, caring, and very believable. The story was well-written, really well-paced, funny, thrilling, exciting, at times interesting, and at times emotional. This movie had great themes such as family relationships, life and death, and bravery.THE VOICE ACTING: Not only ParaNorman had great voice acting, it also had an extremely talented voice cast. Kodi Smit-McPhee, Jeff Garlin, Leslie Mann, Anna Kendrick, Casey Affleck, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and John Goodman, along with many others were great.IN CONCLUSION: ParaNorman was an excellent animated film to nearly wrap up the 2012 summer movie season.10/10"
38,ParaNorman,9,20 August 2012,BEAUTIFULLY MADE...a combination of nostalgia and the 21st century techniques!,"Not only that I have a soft spot for a kid like Norman who doesn't ""belong' to the ""norm"" in what it's perceived to be a standard of society, but the nostalgic feeling which this movie brings you is something to be commended. The background scenes, the colors are vividly so real, not overly done, each characters and some props are delicately handmade (you can see how Norman was made during the credit and other trailers...i.e.: Apple, ""featurette - Little Light"")...simply AMAZING pieces of art work! One of my favorite scenes was towards the end when Norman's 1-on-1 interaction with ""a girl"" (I can't go into much detail...), surrounded by beautiful trees...; the color, the way it was shot, the real meaning of this story...coming all together was something extra-ordinary! Zombies may scare younger kids, but these are no more than the ghosts appearing in everyday cartoons.The message this movie carries is well-worth to allow a kid to finish watching while they crutch onto you!"
39,ParaNorman,9,18 August 2012,"*This is a great movie, though conservatives WILL freak at points*","I absolutely loved this movie, and the only reason this is a 9 and not a 10 are the black/white out points in the movie when Norman sees into the past. They last a bit too long, and feel a little awkward. The plot is great, and I hope anyone who even thinks they /might/ see it does. It really is a great film. The plot is strong, the twists(and there are a good few of them) are clever, and though, as one negative review /did/ mention, the ghosts aren't really the focus of the film, the idea isn't lost on most people. It's to show Norman can speak with the dead. The movie wasn't about him going around and talking to ghosts, but to the dead in general. It's a good movie, and sets everything up well. I will say that in some parts, the humour and dialogue may be a little mature, and one of the characters is revealed as gay by directly saying he has a boyfriend,and there is another joke about the afterlife and how ""not believing in it is like not believing in astrology"", which does show a /very/ mild level of atheism, but in my mind, that isn't anything to worry about. The message is good, and it really is about caring about people, even if they are different. If you're highly religious or conservative, you may not want to see it, but I really do say you should judge for yourself. Some people may think differently, and that's fine, but as a film itself, it is a brilliant film, and it's actually pretty original. This is a breath of fresh air for people like me who are tired of seeing the same old stories in movies today. As a movie buff and a fan of good storytelling, humour and likable/relateable characters, I can easily give this movie two big thumbs up!"
40,ParaNorman,9,24 August 2012,A great movie that shows that animated does not equal suitable for kids,"You should not go into this movie expecting a movie along the lines of Coraline, another stop-motion animated feature by Laika. While it does share the spooky, creepy tone of its predecessor, it is completely different in both tone and pacing. Alas, it is similar in structure and narration, and it can be viewed as a more light-hearted spiritual successor to Coraline. Coraline was a great feature - and is amongst my favorite movies of all time -, but it has a much slower pace, fewer characters and a stronger focus on Coraline. Paranorman is about a young teen named Norman, who is a social outcast because he as the ability to see and speak to ghosts, of which there are plenty in his small town which is heavily inspired by Salem, MA and its rich tradition about the famous witch trials that took place there in the late 17th century. Of course, nobody believes him, neither his parents, nor his shallow cheerleader sister Courtney, and it makes him a well suited target for the school bully Alvin. As it turns out, this ability runs in his family, as his equally awkward uncle informs him, and for a good reason: Every year, this man goes to the witch's grave and reads her a story to put her back to sleep, so the curse she put on the people who sentenced her to death don't rise from their grave. Without wanting to spoil the story too far, of course, Norman has to face his fate and go up agains the witch... and the townspeople, who are scared by the sudden presence of the undead. Fear is a main plot element in this movie, but not in the sense that this movie is scary. At least not for adults. The movie is cheerfully spooky, much like you would feel on a Halloween-party. What I really liked about the movie is its pacing: It is a fast past movie that does not waste time on unimportant details, but takes its time when appropriate, especially in character development. The roles could not be more stereotypical when it comes to horror movies, but you will soon come to realize that, while it cannot be considered an exploitation or a mockery, it plays with those clichés and when you think you have the plot figured out, they throw you a curve ball and lead it into a different direction, without giving you the feeling they pull things out of a hat. It pays tribute to classic horror scenarios, A and B movies (Halloween being one of the most prominent), but finds its own way and place in this genre. It is not a horror movie. It is not really a comedy, even though you'll have plenty to laugh about. Action is used in small doses, so you still have to - and can! - pay attention to the story and the characters. As for the technical part, I do think this movie sets new standards for stop motion pictures, as Coraline did before. The animation is much, much smoother than in Coraline. What really takes the prize is the facial animation. Not only for stop motion standards, but for animation standards in general, the characters' expressions are so well detailed and unique that I can only imagine what a piece of work it must have been to animate it. Especially since there is a huge amount of different characters involved, and a lot more scenes involving many at the same time. As a final note, I would like to add that, like Coraline, it is not a movie suitable for little children. Like Coraline, the movie has a darker tone, that, even when considering the lighter, more comedic approach, is very suitable to scare children and giving them nightmares. There is zombies, ghosts, witches, dark forests and loads of creepy sounds. Even more so, children will have trouble following the plot, and will of course not be able to get all the nods towards classic horror movies. If you are a parent, think twice before taking your children to see this movie. Not because it is bad, but it might be too much for your kids. Again, people need to see animated movies of all kind as an art form that is not necessarily geared towards a young audience, and this movie is a prime example that animated does not equal suitable for kids.9/10"
41,ParaNorman,8,21 August 2012,a charmingly spooky family film that serves up unexpected depth and a delicious visual experience,"Appearances aren't everything; of this, I'm well aware. But when it comes to film and television, really, they can't hurt. Take director Tim Burton, for example. Personally, I love the guy, but even I'll admit that (especially as of late) his films don't quite surpass the masses' (or even my) expectations. That's not to say his movies are terrible, if anything they retain some redeeming qualities as a result of their artistic flairfor me, at least, the director's style is always the one aspect of his work that never fails to impress, even if it has recently become a bit redundant. Then there are shows like AMC's Mad Men. More than anything, I love the show for its incredible substance, but it's also one of my favorites because it's the one show I watch that's always so damn pretty to look at.That's part of the reason a film like ParaNorman attracts me in the first placebecause, physically, it just looks so great. The fact that it's stop motion animation excites me on so many levels; I've mentioned on the site before that I find this style of animation to be one of my absolute favoritesthe look and feel of these films is wonderfully unique, and the vision and patience of their filmmakers are downright admirable. Likewise, the fact that ParaNorman is also one of the most ambitious stop motion films I've seen simply reaffirms my faith in the art of movies. Action sequences, car chases, special effectssurely none of these are easy feats for a film comprised of pictures of puppets, but the talented and dedicated individuals over at LAIKA and Focus Features (the same team that brought us 2009's Coraline), despite their two long years of work, make it look nothing short of effortless (and I didn't even have to see it in 3D to think so!).What's even nicer about this film is that not only does it offer up a healthy serving of visual artistry, it also proves it's got an entertaining little story to go along with it. Taking place in the fictional Blithe Hollow, a Salem-esque New England town with an affinity for witch-hunting paraphernalia, ParaNorman follows the eerily charming Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit-McPhee), an offbeat boy obsessed with zombie flicks and possessed with the unnatural ability to communicate with the dead. Ostracized by the town, bullied by his peers, and even feared by his family for his strange ability, Norman struggles through his days alone and friendless, until one afternoon his crazy Uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman) tells him of the evil witch's curse, one that only he's capable of subduing. Teaming up with an unlikely crew (voiced by the likes of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Anna Kendrick, and Casey Affleck), Norman finds himself face-to- face with the real walking dead as he attempts to put an end to the curse and save all those who doubt him.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/paranorman/"
42,ParaNorman,7,20 August 2012,ParaNorman is a fun horror story for the whole family (maybe not those under age 10),"In the vein of iconic monster/adventure properties like The Monster Squad, Scooby-Doo even The Iron Giant comes Laika's follow-up to their hit film Coraline. ParaNorman, is a fantastically intricate stop-motion (or ""stop-frame"" to you film fans in the UK) animated film that follows Norman, a young boy who is more than a little obsessed with the macabre he can actually see and communicate with ghosts. He takes it all in stride but is most definitely an outcast but like all great outcasts, he's destined to save the day because of his eccentricities. It's a common story but from the mind of Chris Butler, this more or less familiar theme is spun just enough and is 'wonky' enough to become a rather compelling and highly distinctive genre mashing fare.ParaNorman was inspired by, among 80′s classics like The Goonies and many Amblin era films, but this story, a sort of John Carpenter meets John Hughes, looks like all of the its inspirations were thrown in a blender and the product was this deliciously fun film. Besides the nods to and framework of the the films that this derives inspiration from, ParaNorman is a film with a lot going on and mostly it comes down to themes. So many in fact, there's almost a theme for every zombie or pitchfork running through this frenzied film. There's a loner/social outcast theme, a bully theme, a distant/misunderstood family theme, and then of course the tropes and set ups to make this a simultaneous horror/comedy/family film (though regarding the inherent degree of horror, even in ""claymation"", is not an automatic recommendation for little kids). But as odd as the events depicted and the hats worn in the picture, this hybrid, for lack of a better word, works.Voice acting in animated films has gotten better just as the animation itself has grown by leaps an bounds. Just 5 years ago, the draw to an animated film (CG or otherwise) seemed to be just the caliber of A- lister attached. Now that animated films are way more abundant the idea here is not the who, but more who's right for the character. In this respect, Butler and Fell's inspired casting nearly outshines their superior animation efforts. Kodi Smit-McPhee simply nails the role of Norman but as great as his turn in the titular role, he's given help form an amazing supporting cast. One great take away from the film is that while the rag tag team of misfits saving the day looks like something you've seen before, the cast is really quite the opposite. Having the likes of Casey Affleck playing a jock and Christopher Mintz- Plas (McLovin!) as a bully are both brilliant casting choices but also just outside the typical sort of casting that. Instead each non-typical voice in the film gives their character immense depth and emotion.With all the great animation and wonderfully dreary character designs, the story has a real message and this is not just a film to bring in the kids (again this isn't recommended for kids under say 10 at the very least). There is a series of morals that as subtle as a brick or an after-school special run the gamut from all you need is love, to friendship is its own reward to go easy on the little guy/odd ball to believing in yourself. Yet, in what could be called a bold move for a so called kids movie, is the idea that those who don't learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. Further this notion is brilliantly expanded upon by showing that it's not zombies who are monsters but the humans in general. In an absurd but original approach we find sympathy for the zombies. It's a nice turn to show that people are crazier and more evil than the walking dead and how fear leads us to very rash decisions. Moreover, if we don't snap out of our knee-jerk attitudes and try to learn about the things that scare us, we too will give into fear becoming monsters ourselves. It's a bit heavy handed and force-fed but still entirely relate-able.The challenges Norman faces are bound to be understood by most kids which is just one of the ways that the films' story transcends the setting. In a film void of anything with a pulse Chris Butler and Sam Fell place the macabre events against the backdrop of very tangible and empathetic human element. Yet ParaNorman is not a story about feeling bad for the main (or any) character. It's about following someone on a journey while the whole time championing the idea that ""it's OK to be who you are"". Yet another in the countless ""a hero will rise"" narrative storytelling, what really sets ParaNorman apart is the method in which the story is told. It's a likable bunch of more or less oddballs and rejects who band together and beyond that it's the artistic merit that really takes this to another level. From impressive chase scenes, to colorful story to incredibly detailed scenery and entirely unique set/character design, ParaNorman is a real treat.Marc Ciafardini of GoSeeTalk.com"
43,ParaNorman,8,19 August 2012,"Imaginative, entertaining film, with a heart.","I confess that, at first, by watching this film's trailer and publicity, I felt a complete desire to get away from it. Nevertheless I went to see it to the theater convinced by a beautiful girl. It was my great surprise to see a film that is imaginative, as well as intelligent, with great humor for kids and adults. It pays homage to B horror movies and classics and uses stop- motion animation stylishly well. It is funny, it has a simple, yet entertaining story, with great pace. It also has a great score by Jon Brion, which combined with the images in some sequences, made me had goosebumps of joy. But, above all, the film has a heart, which is uncommon to see nowadays in the regular commercial cinema. Very recommendable. Go see it with your kids, or with your girlfriend or boyfriend, or with your dad, or with a beautiful girl (just like I did). All family is in for a good time.Especially if some of you like stop-motion, zombie or B horror movies, or even if you see them just to have fun of them. I thank her very much for taking me to see this wonderful and fun film."
44,ParaNorman,9,19 August 2012,"Clever, Funny, and Insightful","""Paranorman"" is one special film, one that dares mix genres, doesn't talk down to its audience, and it's most likely to have people talking about it afterward because of the way it looks and its content. It is a film that younger children will probably not fully understand because it deals with a variety of themes that can be a bit controversial and have rarely been seen in children's movies. However, it certainly deals with important issues in contemporary society, and bullying comes to mind quiet clearly.""Norman"" is no ordinary boy. He has ""the gift"" of communicating with dead beings. Something that, we soon discover, is the source of constant harassment and pain for him. It is also the ability that might save his town later on as the community finds itself at the mercy of supernatural beings.This film is a rarity because it is not afraid to a diversity of characters in an honest way. The community is diverse, and you can see this in the opening scenes, as we follow Norman's interaction with several members of his town. Norman is very sweet and has no evil or resentful thoughts. He is frustrated and sad because he is misunderstood. His parents tolerate him but don't believe him. He seems to have no friends at first, but then he meets a couple of outsider and together, they need to find a way to save the world.Norman and the children in this film speak and interact like normal preteens or teenagers. I liked the way these fabulous creations try to reenact elements of our contemporary society. People should look at this film carefully and be prepared to answer a few questions on why society is such a frail unit, as its members are constantly in disagreement about and how to fix their problems.""Paranorman"" will charm most of its audience because its message is gently presented. Watching these zombies is not scary, finding out how society deals with them is what parents might have problems explaining. Learning the source of the entire crisis will also shock a few people with its messages. You will be laughing but thinking about what you see on the screen, wondering why it has not been explored before this way before.Nearly 40 years ago, ""Bewitched"" had people from all over the country laughing at the ordeals of Samantha and her husband. There are similar aspects in both, the film and this TV series, but Norman's heart is full of innocence and genuine love. He wants to heal what's damaged. ""Norman"" is beautifully produced and full of remarkable vocal talent. I was very impressed at how moving it was. Great film."
45,ParaNorman,3,23 February 2013,The Movie was alright but...,"The animation was good but I didn't feel this movie was suitable for children to be honest. Not only because of the zombies and scary parts but because of a few things I picked up while watching the film. One thing I noticed was Norman saying the words ""Sex and Violence"". I believe in subliminal messages, our minds are incredible and pick up on things and retain them. Even if we don't remember things consciously, we do subconsciously. These words should not be said in a children's movie. I know what I'm saying may seem like a very minuscule thing, but I feel we as a people are being desensitized and we are losing our morals and standards. I believe if we allow these little words to be said in a family movie, it will only get even worse later."
46,ParaNorman,1,23 August 2012,terrible movie,"I seriously don't understand how this movie could get a 7.5 rating . My 7 year old couldn't sleep after seeing this movie.This movie was SO horrible that my 7 year old thought the zombies would break through the door, I had to stay up all night explaining that this was a bad fictional movie.Just like the other reviewers we didn't stay the whole movie, but part of the scenes we saw did do the damage. We are so disappointed by this movie and the way that animated movies are becoming so violent. If these companies want to experiment with animation they should clearly state that such movies are for adults and not kids. Next time PlEASE don't show commercials for such kind of movies during kids shows."
47,ParaNorman,4,16 December 2012,Did Not Enjoy This One! Another 2012 Animation Blunder!,"I had heard a lot about ParaNorman. For some time, I even thought it was something related to the great Paranormal Activity. Well, neither was this a horror flick, nor a comedic one. I was flabbergasted with the plot - clichéd plot of which, what 100 movies - sorry millions of movie are made. I might be exaggerating, but this one is not for people who enjoy animation with a touch of a story.What I loved about this movie, and for what I gave 4 stars is its music, the animation and the creativity with dialogues. The greatest dialogue was that of his mom at the end, something related to ""embarrassment""Not a must watch! No wonder Golden Globes missed it!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? 60% YESLanguage: Yes Sex: No Nudity: No Violence: Yes Grotesque: Yes"
48,ParaNorman,10,23 September 2012,Stop-frame animation is always worth a watch!,"I'm twenty one and went to see this movie with a friend. To be honest, we only went to see it as we had a 2 for 1 voucher but nevertheless, we were in hysterics at this film and we found ourselves quoting it days later. The last stop-frame animation movie I saw was Coraline, and that was both creepy and genius. ParaNorman was both genius and hilarious with a hint of darkness and creepiness towards the end.. ""I don't want to go to sleep, and you can't make me!!!"" All of the voices were well cast but I especially like Tucker Albrizz as Neil and Anna Kendrick as Courtney. Pretty hilarious.. With some teen/adult humour for the older ones and the obvious laughs and humour for the younger ones, this film is a must-see! It may be a little scary for small sensitive children but mostly it's fun to watch and trust me adults, you will have the occasional laugh. I give this movie 10 out of 10 because a lot of hard work was put in to this picture.. and they did a great job. Check out some of the films B -rolls on youtube too.. pretty interesting."
49,ParaNorman,9,16 September 2012,Fantastic film,"I really enjoyed this film, the trailer looked funny and light hearted but once the film got a good hour in it was clear it was so much more.First off I wouldn't personally take a young child below say 9 to see it as it is rather creepy/ scary. The adult jokes arn't an issue, as they wouldn't be understood by anyone young, but simply it is a bit full on for young viewers. HOWEVER, I feel this does need to be said, there is a gay joke in the film, for which some reviewers have dropped it to 2 or 3 stars for. This is outrageous. I would not feel any need to warn anyone within the 21st century that there is a homosexual joke... come on people none of your kids are going to be traumatised by this. My reason for a warning is simply the scary scenes (I'm sure of which most children could deal with anyway).The animation of the film is brilliant, and it adds a needed unrealistic feel to some of these'full on scenes'. The humour of the film is brilliant, from slap stick for the young viewers to adult jokes and references for the adults watching.Keeping it short, ParaNorman is a fantastically funny film, with a warm hearted message about being accepted; by yourself more than by others. It touches on some serious issues and obviously, deals with the issue of death, hence the PG rating. I think it would be a shame to miss; good family film, nice messages, great laugh as well as edge of seat action."
50,ParaNorman,9,16 September 2012,stunning cool film!!!,"went to see this film earlier today. 2d version with my kids, girl 7, boy 5. i loved it. loads of funny adult humour which flies over the kids heads. very unique cartoon in a very good way. i normally sleep through kids films but this one kept me awake. the fact its not CGI is a huge plus. film had a more realistic feel to it because of this. visually film is excellent so congrats to whoever was involved with that side of things. two kids never opened their mouths from start to finish bar laughing and milling 4euro bars of chocolate. normally they ask me when is the film over or i'm bored etc etc. had a feeling they were as impressed as me which they both confirmed at the end of the film. all in all, 3 of us went home very happy. regarding bringing young kids to it, don't worry at all in my opinion. Was loads of kids in the cinema and i didn't see anyone leave early or cry or appear frightened. thanks all involved with with the film. probably my favourite kiddie trip to the cinema!!!!!!!!!"
51,ParaNorman,8,16 September 2012,movie review,"A great movie, though little out off normal line of movies. Shows unusual background with many bumps on the story line.The graphics were great for a stop-motion film, The voice acting was good and it had a great twist. It was funny, adventurous and had a little emotional touch even the 3D graphics are enjoyable. The director goes strong after his critically acclaimed Coraline. The zombies were funny and it's one of the best animated films, it has a very good character development with ghosts flying in the house doing their unfinished work.Norman the kid is really PARANORMAL and strange. Overall it's easily a must watch from my side. I am looking forward to it's sequel"
52,ParaNorman,10,4 September 2012,"Scary, intense, funny, impressive and a tear jerker","ParaNorman has been in development since around Coraline came out and you can really tell by how much effort is put into it. This is Chris Butler's third full length movie that he has worked on, except this time he is the writer and director. His other works are Coraline and Corpse Bride, both of which were critically acclaimed stop-motion movies. Either way, ever since the beginning I have been anticipating this movie with high expectations... and usually when you have high expectations a movie tends to fail to those expectations... but not ParaNorman! It's hard for me to describe what makes ParaNorman so awesome without spoiling the plot, so I will do my best. First of all, this movie is violent. Which is saying something for a PG movie because this movie deals with a lot of death and violence but it usually keeps it light-hearted. The movie has great dialogue and is funny without relying on slapstick action too much. Usually it's the clever interaction between the characters which is where all of the humor is. Also, the ending action sequence is amazing/over the top! Laika has once again made an amazing ending action sequence.There are some reasons why I wouldn't suggest taking really little kids to see this: first of all it is intense. The plot is talking about some pretty dark material and it is technically a horror movie. So expect some jump scares and horror elements. While there is some swearing in this movie, it isn't that bad or frequently used. Also some of the things that make this movie funny is that it makes reference to 1980s horror movies. The soundtrack is very similar to cheap 80s b-movies, and even the intro to the movie is made to look like an 80s movie. In one of the scenes ParaNorman is watching an old 80s zombie movie and it has a stereotypical female character which makes reference to 80s movies. However ParaNorman isn't a parody of 80s movies.This movie also has really good soundtrack. During the scary b-movie scenes it sounds like a classic 80s soundtrack, but during the emotional scenes the soundtrack really shines. The soundtrack really made certain scenes in the movie powerful.The stop-motion animation in this movie is amazing! Literally, I have never seen another stop-motion film run with such a high-frame rate and run so smoothly. It looks really nice and the visual effects on the witch's cloud form is truly amazing. The final sequence of the movie also uses some great effects and the witch herself... well... you'll just have to see for yourself. You can tell the Laika studios really cares for every intricate detail in this movie. Honestly it looks better than a CGI movie... mainly because all of the characters are real objects so they naturally look more detailed than a CGI model.To conclude, ParaNorman is an amazing movie that combines humor, horror, violence and even action to make a great film. The visuals also look better than CGI and this movie is probably the only stop-motion movie that actually has breathtaking moments. The movie also has some tear jerking moment (I know my brother and cousin both shed some tears). Either way, GO SEE THIS MOVIE! BUT DON'T COMPLAIN IF YOU THINK IT ISN'T KID APPROPRIATE! All I can say is that this is one of the greatest animated movies ever to be released."
53,ParaNorman,9,28 August 2012,A very good film with much deeper meaning than what meets the eyes,"There are times when you see a film and then you wish the whole world sees it from the same point of view you had. This film is one of those rare films which although hovers around a small boy, some paranormal activities and little fun, the deeper message of love, affection and forgiveness is so strong that it will bring tears to your eyes by the end. The movie subtly covers the hate plaguing this world and how we should overcome it. Although the script chose to depict the hate through a witches eyes and the protagonist boy being the different person among the crowd being the savior of the world, the story is not the run of the mill animation stuff but has a nice flow and Beautifully written and wonderful animation... a very good movie for family audience."
54,ParaNorman,8,20 August 2012,Brand New Classic,"Although it is strange for a Zombie themed kids movie to come out so far away from Halloween, this stop-motion film is funny, entertaining, and surprisingly stylistic. This film is filled with humor and action that references many classic horror movies, and as a result, almost seems ready made for a cult-following.Norman is a strange kid. He can see ghosts, and as a result he is made fun of by his classmates, disowned by his teenage sister, and misunderstood by his parents. However he makes friends with Neil, who gets made of equally because he is fat. The town is celebrating it's 300th anniversary; however, the town has a dark past where an evil witch killed the men that put her to death. Norman's eccentric uncle tells the child that he must put the witch's ghost back to sleep or all hell will break loose. Of course Norman can't do it in time, and of course all hell breaks loose. The seven men that the witch killed come back from the dead in Zombie form, and Norman, along Neil, their older siblings, and the school bully, run through town trying to stop it all before anyone gets hurt.The film has a stylized feel, much like the movie Gremlins did. The town looks like a Hollywood backlot, and the characters are all archetypes of the genre. The humor is often mature for children, and probably a little to 21st century for a lot of parents. However, this makes the movie even better, and there is still plenty to enjoy for everyone that sees it. Norman is very likable, and so are all the other characters, especially Norman's uncle, and the punk bully. Not to mention the zombies are actually hilarious and fun characters too, and they really flavor up the movie.The character designs are all pretty grotesque. Norman is the most normal looking character in the movie. His face resembles the little kid from those old Kleenex commercials. The other characters, however, have either enormous bellys, lopsided faces, or reverse triangle shape bodies. The zombies too have elongated faces and body parts that repeatedly fall off. Many scenes from the movie pay homage to classic horror and monster flicks, which are all done in ways that are funny, enjoyable, and subtle.ParaNorman may not end up being a financial success, but it is a funny, different, and very cool movie. The ending involving a final battle with the witch stretches on way too long, but the movie has merits that this reviewer was certainly not expecting, and the end of the movie makes up for the tiresome battle. Also, the 3D is good, but certainly not worth the price. This movie is a real unexpected treat to watch, and it almost creates a new genre with the horror film for kids. Some kids might not get it, and of course some may be too young, but the movie is, in the opinion of this reviewer, damn good.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"
55,ParaNorman,6,20 August 2012,A Likable Movie not without it faults,"Reviewer @ MediumRaretv.org Basking in the success of their first stop-motion animated feature film Coraline, Laika studios attempts to duplicate that success with its 3-D comedy, ParaNorman. Directors Sam Fell and Chris Butler leads an all-star voice over cast and a team of animators to bring the animated, horror, parody to the big screen.Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road) is the voice of misunderstood adolescent Norman Babcock. Norman has an appreciation for horror flicks and has a bit of a reputation. Norman is considered an outcast in the New England town of Blithe, where he resides with sister, Courtney (Anna Kendrick, Up in the Air); mother, Sandra (Leslie Mann,Knocked up); father, Perry (Jeff Garlin, Curb Your Enthusiasm); and the ghost of his deceased grandmother (Elaine Stritch)which only he can see and hear. It's his communication with the dead that virtually makes Norman a pariah in his community and keeps him locking horns with his own fatherand the fact that no one believes he can actually see the dead. It's only when a curse threatens to destroy the town that the citizens of Blithe soon realize that Norman may be their only hope for salvation.The script relies on the often-recurring theme of diversity and acceptance to drive the storyline, which quickly moves the film into the realm of predictable. The irony is, nearly every character appears to be drawn perfectly imperfect. Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) whom quickly becomes Norman sidekick looks more like a beach ball than boy. Fell and Butler seemed to have made it a point not to the overload the viewer with aesthetically pleasing animated characters. In fact, many of the characters are often drawn overweight and with distinguishing characteristics. It's seems that it's an attempt to remind the audience that no one is perfect and we're all differentto further drive their point. The characters imperfections are merely parodying society as a whole, which is further illustrated in the plot when the townspeople start their own modern day witch-hunt.The 3-D animation gives life to the all too familiar storyline and themes, though, eye-popping effects were minimum. Viewers of ParaNorman are left craving more 3-D action from the comedy/horror flick, but that's not to say the movie didn't have its gratifying moments visually. When the witch of Blithe descends upon the city, her spiritual form is represented by a fiery storm cloud with a diabolical face that is slightly eerie even in 3-D animation.The comedic antis of a capable cast, which includes John Goodman, Casey Affleck, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Tempestt Bledsoe, further elevates the 3-D comedy, making it a worthwhile watch.The themes of ParaNorman feel a bit repetitive and in your face, but it's still an entertaining film with plenty of laughs for the family."
56,ParaNorman,4,18 August 2012,Too scary for little kids and too frustrating and uneven for adults.,"""ParaNorman"" is an odd and unsatisfying animated adventure that is probably too scary for little kids definitely too frustrating and uneven for adults. It has a strange tone that shifts back and forth between slapstick comedy and deep solemn melodrama until eventually the melodrama takes over and we arrive at a long climactic scene that is dark and depressing. This is a kid's movie, right? The movie has a promising beginning, however. It takes place in the small town of Blithe Hollow, a centuries-old berg that, back in the 17th century, was the site of its own version of The Salem Witch Trials. Back then a little girl named Agatha was brought before a kangaroo court on a flimsy accusation that she was practicing witchcraft and was sentenced to death. Upon her death she cursed the town, the cure for which is for someone to annually read from a certain book that will lull her restless spirit back to sleep for another year. Four hundred years later, the curse still persists. The present citizenship of Blithe Hollow is not bothered by the legend; in fact, it embraces the story to the point that the entire town has dedicated its very architecture to witches and witch burnings. The town's welcome sign features a hanging witch along with the words: ""Welcome to Blithe Hollow, a great place to hang!"" Within this setting our focus falls on little Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee), a spiky-haired ten year-old in whose tiny frame beats a weary heart. Norman is stricken with an unusual ability  he can see dead people. All around him, ghosts wish him good day and he communicates with them freely. The living, especially the adults, don't believe Norman and think that either A.) He has an overactive imagination or B.) He's certifiable. At school, all the kids know about his unusual claim and he often finds the word ""Freak"" scrawled on his locker. There is an effective scene early in the film that reveals the gravity of Norman's predicament. We see Norman walking down the street on his way to school; his sad eyes focused on the sidewalk as various ghosts pass him and send greetings. The living people, who can't see the dead, sneer and point as he walks past.Norman's only true friend (among the living) is a portly, optimistic kid named Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) who is the target of school bullies but doesn't let them get him down. He is the positive to Norman's negative, especially in the presence of Alvin, the school's dimwitted head bully. They eventually join Norman in his adventure along with his teenage sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick) and Neil's idiot jock brother Mitch (Casey Affleck). The adventure begins when Norman is visited by his crazy old Uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman) who informs Norman of the town curse and bestows the curse-altering book upon him. He also drops the bad news that the tome must be read at the site of the witch's grave by sundown or the dead with rise from the grave.Needless to say, Norman doesn't read the book before sundown and the dead start rising from the grave. Panicky townspeople respond with shotguns and pitchforks as Norman struggles to find a way to end the curse. It is about this point that the movie begins to fall apart. The movie should come alive with comic zeal (as promised in the trailer) but it doesn't. There are a few fun slapstick moments but they are undercut by some terribly sad revelations about the little girl who was hanged all those years ago. As the movie inches toward its climax, the tone of the film waffles back and forth and can't decide if it is a comedy or a serious melodrama. One minute we're looking at some comic sight gags, the next minute we are suppose to be touched by something that Norman has discovered about the dead little girl. This leads to a very long and tiresome final act as Norman breaks into the spirit world to talk the angry witch  who glows with a fearsome yellow light  into recalling the curse. That scene is so serious and so violent (not to mention endless) that little kids may be frightened.That's really too bad because the movie opens with promise. The animation uses stop-motion instead of full-on computer animation (which, admittedly, is getting a little tiresome). The town and the people have an angular, abstract look, almost Tim Burton-esque. They are not crisp and polished. The town of Blithe Hollow is a fascinating place to behold with buildings that jut and lean at odd angles, and trees with leafless branches that reach out like gnarled fingers.Will kids enjoy it? Probably not the little ones. This is often a scary film that deals not only with zombies, witches, curses, and the occult, but also the dead rising from the grave, and a little dead girl who threatens to wipe the town off the map. Maybe the appropriate age would about around 8 or so. Needless to say, the PG-rating is pretty strong. It may not be a good movie no matter what age you are. You leave with the feeling that the craft of the movie is commendable, but you wish more effort had gone into the screenplay. The wonderful animation rests at the service of a movie that starts well but ultimately grows dull and joyless."
57,ParaNorman,8,18 August 2012,An eleven-year old boy named Norman tries to reverse a witch's curse to save his town from crumbling.,"I was very surprised seeing ""ParaNorman"". I thought it was going to be good, but I didn't expect Laika to live up to the standard they set with ""Coraline"".But they definitely did.I particularly like how humor was cleverly added throughout the movie. They even manage to make the brutal part of the movie spark laughter throughout the theater.I also liked how the messages of the story are inspiring to people. ""You don't have to be the same as everyone else to achieve greatness"", ""One person, no matter how small, can make a difference"", and ""A crowd can get swayed by anything"", are some of the main messages in the end of the movie. But they still make sure you have a deep understanding of both point of views, the ""good"" and the ""evil"".I loved this, yet I do not recommend it for young children. When I was in the theater, there was a boy about the age of four and his dad sitting behind us. They left about 20 minutes into the film. It takes too long to get to the point where the zombies are good. But my nine-year-old sister loved it and wasn't scared at all, so I think,depending on how sensitive a child is about movies, 7 and up is appropriate."
58,ParaNorman,1,25 August 2012,Planting the seeds of indoctrination...,"5 minutes into the start of the film the father character calls his dead mother a tramp. Let's analyze that for a moment. I was under the impression that children were supposed to honor their fathers and mothers are we not? I was under the impression that this was a ""childrens movie, full of humor and with a great story."" Well you can imagine my surprise when I hear that word come from the supposed ""father figure"" in the story. Unbelievable. And how about the gruesome scenes of death? In one part of the film 7 political figures murder a small girl who they assume is involved in witchcraft. She then puts a spell on them to become the undead. That seems a little violent to be included in a kids movie in my opinion. Later in the movie the father is ranting about his son ""seeing ghosts"" and says ""I'm nothing if I'm not a LIBERAL, but this hippie stuff has to stop."" What was the need to insert that into the films dialogue??? And now for the best part. All throughout the film we see a relationship evolving between the main characters older sister and his friends older, football playing, and muscular prone older brother. One doesn't find out until the end of the film that this older brother happens to have a ""boyfriend"" who loves ""chick-flicks."" YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. So, say I were a young kid who was with my parent while seeing this movie... what would I be thinking??? It might go something like this: ""Daddy! I really liked Paranorman! But what's a tramp? Whay was Norman's daddy a liberal??? Why did those bad people kill that little girl??? Is it okay for boys to have boyfriends??? This movie is, in my opinion, nothing more than socially liberal indoctrination aimed at the younger generation. I've no idea what kind of garbage we can expect to see in the future, if something like this is only PG. I pray that more people see the truth behind this movie and what it stands for. The only good thing that can come out of seeing this movie is leaving it 1 star and exposing it for what it is. I personally am greatly disappointed in this film."
59,ParaNorman,1,23 August 2012,Nothing Like Coraline - This Movie Sucked,"If you wanted to see this movie because you loved Coraline and loved how dark it was aka not suitable for kids, you will haaaate this movie. It was so lame, I was yawning the whole time and waiting for some Coraline-esque awesomeness to happen, and it never did. Totally appropriate to take kids because that is how lame this movie was. It was super cheesy with all the typical cheesy plot lines you've seen over and over again. Seriously though why does this review have to be ten lines when I can accurately sum it up in about five. The moral of the story was so typical and cheesy. I expected this movie to be somewhat appealing to adults like Coraline was and it was not at all. I even saw it in 3D - what a waste of money, $13 I could have used for something much better."
60,ParaNorman,5,12 June 2013,Meh...,"Don't get me wrong, I love animation. I like claymation fairly well, although there are some that I didn't really get into like Coraline. This movie wasn't bad but it didn't tickle my fancy either. I was hoping it would be great because a lot of people were saying that when it came out next to Hotel Transylvania and Frankenweenie, this was the better of the three. I haven't seen Frankenweenie yet but I did see Hotel Transylvania and thought that was much better than ParaNorman. I honestly don't even remember much of the movie, just that I didn't love it like I normally do with animated movies. I guess this is just one of those films that can be a hit or a miss depending on the person."
61,ParaNorman,,6 January 2013,stereotypes,"almost nice. but not impressive. a story with horror crumbs not very different by many others. special note - stop - motion. and a charming character - Neil. but it is not really enough for be really interesting. film of border, not for kids - scary scenes are at each step, not for adults - except horror fans, credible in some aspects but boring in many other, it is only an exercise of technique. a ball of sounds and puppets , living dead and cries. sure, lesson about difference, it is , in same time, demonstration of correct policy. but the expected show is not present. so, only a strange show full of clichés and stereotypes."
62,ParaNorman,5,18 November 2012,"It rose from the grave, but will most likely return there quite soon...","I had been looking forward to watching ""ParaNorman"" since I saw the trailer, as it looked to be interesting - sort of an animation with a hint of that Tim Burton touch to it.The animation itself is nice, and the characters even more nice. Actually, the characters in ""ParaNorman"" were the ones that were the most appealing to me. There were funny characters, somber characters, gloomy characters and annoying characters. But they all had one thing in common; nicely detailed and unique from one another. For an animated movie it is very important that the characters have personalities and stands out, which was the case in ""ParaNorman"".Story-wise ""ParaNorman"" was adequate, but a bit too heavy on the morale and educational aspect. The story was interesting, but it was presented in a manner that was a tad too heavy on the morales for my liking.It should be said that the voice acting was actually quite good in ""ParaNorman"", and that did help the movie along a good way.Initially I had perhaps a bit too high expectations for this animation because I like zombies and dark things. It was adequate entertainment, but hardly a movie that stood out in an otherwise fairly crowded genre of animation movies. Unfortunately ""ParaNorman"" didn't have that special ingredient to make it raise itself above mediocrity. It had the occasional touch of Burton magic similarities here and there, but were nowhere near the angles of Burton's dark, Gothic sense of surrealism.A great animated movie for the kids and young teens, but for adults it doesn't really offer that much, and you'd probably be better off with something in the likes of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" or ""Corpse Bride""."
63,ParaNorman,6,29 September 2012,Last 30 minutes the best,"I saw ParaNorman in 2D earlier on today and I have to say, for a kids' film, and an animated one at that, considering that type of genre nowadays, it was pretty good. Not the best but definitely one of the better ones I've seen. The basic story is about a kid called Norman Babcock who can talk to the dead. Several hundred years before, a witch put a curse on the town and because Norman is the only one who can talk to the dead, he is the only one who can save the town and undo the curse. The first hour is just okay. It isn't brilliant and some of the jokes do fall flat(I.E, Norman saying to Neil who's kissing his dog's ghost that it's not his chin) but hey, it's a kid's film, what do you expect? One joke I did enjoy was when Norman was talking to the ghosts, I noticed that the gangster ghost was surrounded by fish, jokes with that sort of subtlety are great. The last half an hour for me, were definitely the best. This is when everything gets going, the zombies come alive, Norman meets the witch, it is just a lot of fun. The zombie car chase scene isn't as exciting as I thought but the animation is great,so are the colours and the story is a lot of fun. Horror fans or anyone who likes Coraline or that sorta thing will definitely get a kick out of this. And anyone who doesn't, will still get a kick out of it. Overall, a fun and entertaining way to kill a few hours at the cinema."
64,ParaNorman,8,8 September 2017,A delightful animated film with horror elements,"Norman Babcock is a slightly strange child he can see and converse with the dead! Nobody believes him of course and he is picked on in school. The only person who wants to be his friend is Neil, a chubby buy who is also picked on. Norman lives in the town of Blythe Hollow; a town with a dark past in colonial times a girl with a similar gift to Normans was hanged for witchcraft. Before she died she cursed her persecutors to a horrible death. Norman's estranged uncle tells him that it is up to him to protect the town from the continuing effects of the curse. He doesn't have long to discover what must be done and as the witch's original victims rise from their graves he finds himself working with Neil, the school bully, his sister and the bully's sporty brother who his sister has a crush on.This stop-go animation from the people behind 'Coroline' is a lot of fun. It plays with horror tropes in a delightful way without being too scary for most children. The opening scene where Norman watches a horror film with the ghost of his late grandmother sets a tone for the level of scariness at least until the final confrontation with the witch, this is a little scarier but not excessively so. The ending is ultimately happy so younger viewers are less likely to be left feeling nervous than they might have been if the witch had been vanquished. The animation looks really good and the voice cast do a fine job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to animation fans looking for something a little different and even to horror fans it certainly won't scare the latter group but the way it plays with the genre is great fun."
65,ParaNorman,8,23 April 2017,ParaNorman,"The first time I watched this film was in 2015 when I was baby-sitting my neighbours 3 sons who were all below the age of 13 years. We were watching it late at night and the film itself had some scary scenes and even the zombies were scary. To be honest it wasn't too far off the style of Scooby Too, but it was a little more realistic. What made it more realistic was the animation. The animations were fantastic and made the theme of the movie more engaging. The paranormal theme is somewhat unknown to the vast majority of human beings, that is also part of the reason why the film is scary. However, I loved how moving the story-line. The cast was voiced really nicely and Norman was given a bashful, brave, cute and hyper-sensitive awareness of others (hence his ability to see ghosts/spirits, paranormal activity). I love the story-line itself and how the whole issues was based on real history. It was cool of the writer to explore a broader social issue. It was somewhat an education for watchers. It moved me to the point of tears. Essentially, the original soundtrack was beautifully moving and fun, the characters were casted well, funny scenes, fabulous craftsmanship in the animations and great story!"
66,ParaNorman,10,5 April 2017,The Whole Town Hates This BoyFind Out Why,"""There's nothing wrong with being scared, Norman, so long as you don't let it change who you are."" Going into the stop-motion animated family film Paranorman, I didn't expect the movie to have such a strong, relatable message. At most I assumed it would be two things: juvenile and entirely light-hearted. However, I was pleasantly surprised as I was swept up into the humorous adventure lead by young Norman and the kids that got caught up with him. The characterization in Paranorman is excellentthe characters each have unique personalities, and the combination of their personalities is perfect for not only comedy, but also interesting relationships and a journey you can't help but enjoy. The striking animation of Paranorman adds even more personality to the film. It was animated by stop-motion, using full-color 3D printers to create a wide variety of facial expressions for the characters. The quirky animation is very detailed, down to the glossy, viscous saliva on the tongue of a decaying corpse. Directed by Chris Butler and Sam fell, known for hit animated films Coraline and Flushed Away respectively, Paranorman has characters voiced by stars such as Anna Kendrick, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and John Goodman. Overall, Paranorman is an excellent choice for anyone looking for an eccentric film with congenial characters and striking animation. I loved this movie from start to finish, and I give it ten out of ten stars!"
67,ParaNorman,8,19 February 2017,"Dark, creepy fun","Much darker and more story-driven than most contemporary 'children's' animated films, ParaNorman is a well-written and well-crafted film. Norman can see dead people, of which there seem to be many, and thus ends up having to save the town from zombies, or (spoiler alert), as it turns out,vice-versa. While not new to this film, the 'monsters as victims' is a refreshing spin and provides the filmmakers with a lot of comic potential, as does the transformation the frightened townies into a demented mob. The voice talent is very good and gives the animated characters, despite being imaged in extreme ways, real humanity. One of the directors (Chris Butler) worked on Coraline, which I found extremely creepy and remains one of my favourite animated films. I'm surprised that at the relatively low IMDb score as the movie, which was well received by the critics, is clever, fun and well executed."
68,ParaNorman,,26 December 2016,special,"about the family and solitude and strange friendship and a special gift. all using stop motion for an interesting manner to become hero of the community. ParaNorman has the virtue to be more than a film for children or for adults. it reminds small things in the right manner, with humor and precision, in inspired manner to give realism to a story who mix magic, ordinary life and zombies. ParaNorman is special. for a character who preserves its identity in delicate way. for the nuances who impose a lovely story about the small, insignificant boy, far by society rules/expectations, who becomes the savior of the town. all in creepy/ironic humour covered.so, more than nice."
69,ParaNorman,6,7 September 2016,Paranorman,"Paranorman(2012) Starring:John Goodman, Lesile Mann, Casey Affleck, Kodie Smit- Mcphee, Anna Kendrick, Jodelle Ferland, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse Written By:Chris Butler Directed By:Chris Butler and Sam Fell Review IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES UNTIL SOMEONE RAISES THE DEAD. Well Folks your pal the crypt-critic here does enjoy some stop motion movies I do like some I don't lets take a look at this one. So with that said let's continue hoop-tober. Paranorman was a good movie, very heartfelt, very heartfelt and strangely thought provoking. Norman is considered a freak cause he can hear, see and talks to the dead including his grandmother and his deranged uncle who has the same ability as him. Some think he's acting out while others just think hes crazy. With the exception of a very funny fat kid named Neil who is an outcast himself and wants to be Normans friend. When Norman's uncle dies he passes on his duty to keep the witch at bay. Norman is too late and the dead rise unleashing the witches curse, Norman has to team up with Neil, the school bully, his bossy sister, and Neil's brother the jock to put an end to the witches curse once and for all. What follows is a story that doesn't just have you sympathizing with Norman but with the zombies and the witch as well. The movie has an awesome twist and the ending is unforgettable. You'll love this movie, it is funny, it was sweet, it was scary, tons of fun to sit through but most of all surprising. This movie throws a lot of curve-balls that I almost saw nothing else coming. Story-wise the film is flawless. The directors clearly had a unique vision for this film not just for the story but the characters as well. These were very enjoyable characters but much like Cabin In The Woods(2012) they are breakfast club characters. The beauty queen, the jock, the nerd, the bully and the basket case, however they are deeper then their stereotypes. They are extremely fun to watch in fact more so the Cabin In The Woods(2012) and the voice actors are all spot on. Kodie Smit-Mcphee who played the little boy in Let Me In does a great job at playing Norman, he truly understood this character and I hope he has a good career in the future. Anna Kendrick who actually is one of my favorite actress who I wish to see more of was enjoyable as Norman's bossy beauty queen sister named Courtney. She doesn't understand Norman but as the film progresses she learns that she doesn't need to understand him although she learns that she doesn't need to understand him she is his sister and should always have his back. Tucker Albrizzi was very funny as Neil, Christopher Mintz- Plasse shows a new side playing Alvin the bully, and Casey Affleck was hilarious as Mitch, Neil's weightlifting brother. Another great attribute to the characters is that they all feel real, you probably now someone like one of these characters in this film. The dialogue and conversations feel genuine rather then scripted which is hard task to pull off in a film that is animation instead of live action. Jodelle Ferland did a fantastic job as Aggie the witch, one of the best performances in animation. Her character is really fleshed out, you gratly feel and sympthazie with her and understand the pain she's in just a fantastic character and performance all around. The effects in the movie are very well done for a stop motion picture, I actually thinks the effects are better in this film then they were a nightmare before Christmas. I just feel that this film had better atmosphere that the effects helped at hand. Overall Paranoman is a wonderful little movie that took me by surprise. The effects ,the story, the actors, the characters all brilliant. I give Paranorman a three and a half out of five."
70,ParaNorman,7,6 February 2016,A Touching Tale in the midst of an undead cataclysm,"I really enjoy animation and animated films (especially stop motion) because the artwork is out of this world, but in a lot of cases they fall short on the writing and original plot work. Unfortunately this is the case with ParaNorman.That being said, the environment, puppet work, and special effects are superb throughout this movie.Where the movie draws you in with quirks, family drama, and a misunderstood outcast protagonist, it strays too often into ludicrous comedy that breaks the tension. The main story, however, is fulfilling and makes this well worth the watch even though there are flaws, and clichés all the way through."
71,ParaNorman,7,3 November 2015,"The first third drags, but the last half hour is excellent","This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Feature, losing to Brave. There will be spoilers ahead: It's a challenge to write about this film because talking too much about the plot would ruin it, but it's difficult to discuss it very much without covering at least a little of the plot. I'll tread lightly.Norman is a misfit. He sees ghosts. He talks to ghosts. He's not the first one in his family who's a bit out in left field (there's Uncle Prendergast, for example). The best part of the first half hour or so, aside from the visual look of the film, is the set up of Norman as different and an outcast. The first half hour or so is exposition and it tends to bog things down at first. But it mostly pays off in the end.Norman finds out that it's up to him to prevent a disaster befalling his town, whose people mock and shun him. He gets help here and there at various points, some of it from unexpected sources. The ending is marvelous. Pay very close attention in the last half hour, as it all comes together then.There are some homages to film throughout this one and there's a beautiful scene where a character throws out a line from Shakespeare which must be seen to be appreciated. There are some really nice throwaway gags which you'll miss if you blink at the wrong time. This isn't the best film I've seen, but it's far from the worst. Norman's a good kid and it's an entertaining film.This is available on Blu Ray and DVD. Blu Ray is the way to go if that's an option for you. Well worth watching."
72,ParaNorman,8,11 January 2015,This film was made only for me... probably,"I just watched Paranorman - a film about a boy (called Norman by the way) who can talk to ghosts - and wondered who it was aimed at? The cinema was filled with children (ranging from three years old to early teens) and I came out of the auditorium wondering whether I was the only person in there who truly enjoyed it! Don't think that just because this is a story about a boy who 'sees dead people' that it's anything like the Sixth Sense. It more slightly cashes in on today's obsession with zombies. We've seen zombie movies for adults, zombie movies with 'infected' people instead of walking corpses, romantic zombie movies, comedy zombie movies, zombie movies from the point of view of the undead themselves and now we have a kids' one. It had to happen (and, after watching Paranorman, I say no bad thing).First of all, this is NOT Toy Story or Shrek. For a start it's made from 'claymation' (think Wallace and Gromit) rather than all on computers. Plus, it might pass itself off as a children's' movie, but it seemed more like a homage to cheesy B-movie horror films of days gone by. There are tonnes of in-joke references to horror films that, unless you show your five-year-old Halloween and Return of the Living Dead instead of In the Night Garden, they will have no hope of ever picking up on.In these days of 'target audiences' where 'Film A' is meant for women and 'Film B' is meant for children and so on, watching Paranorman made me wonder whether the filmmakers just sat down, made a movie that they liked and never really gave much through to who it was meant for, hoping it would find an audience out there somewhere. A brave, if not that economical, decision.Bottom line: Paranorman was awesome, but then I'm a man who has grown on up on horror and zombie films. It has loads more heart and character development than other recent 'kids' movies, such as Brave, it looks visually stunning and it's packed full of gags - I just wonder how many children will actually get? Afterthought: I was so caught up in enjoying this movie, I obviously didn't get some concerns from parents. I've read some internet message boards where parents are annoyed at a kids' movie bringing in issues of child death and (takes a deep breath) sexuality. Maybe if you don't want Little Johnny asking you, ""Daddy, why does HE have a 'boyfriend?'"" you really shouldn't take your child to see this.Paranorman = possible future cult movie."
73,ParaNorman,7,21 November 2014,"Fun and technically terrific, but without the soul of the greatest animation","Wildly creative and technically terrific, there is much to admire in this animated play on traditional zombie films. But unlike ""Coraline""  made by some of the same people  or the other Tim Burton/Henry Selick macabre animated works, there's a certain lack of soul and emotion here that keeps it from climbing to the heights of those films. There's also an odd unevenness of tone. While it has a few really inspired visual and verbal gags, it switches a bit awkwardly back and forth between being almost over-earnest, and a kind of hip, ironic distanced humor. And much of the plot feels familiar and/or predictable. Part of the struggle for me as an adult is that this is really made for 'tweens. Too scary for little kids, it also limits the film a bit on the older side. It can't work as easily for adults as some 'kids films' (ala Pixar, etc), where 8 years olds can enjoy it while 30 or 40 year olds can get it on a whole different level. I bet 11 year olds would flat out love this, but unlike the films mentioned earlier, I felt a bit left out of the fun. Still, it has it's moments, both of humor and heart, and I'm glad I saw it. I just don't know that I'd ever go back for seconds."
74,ParaNorman,10,16 October 2014,Visually breath taking. Too scary for some kids... or is it?,"""ParaNorman"" may be too frightening for smaller children but for everyone else, it's a hilarious and scary animated feature that's sure to delight. It's wonderfully animated, with a lot of creative designs and great special effects, and it is filled with consistent laughs that will appeal particularly to fans of horror films. It also has a surprisingly touching and well done message towards the end that parents will be happy to see without being like the obvious P.S.A.s that are thrown together at the end of so many children's cartoons. I'm a big fan of zombie and ""classic"" 80-90's horror and I had a terrific time. An added bonus is that with this one and you can bring your kid brother/sister to have some fun too. I wouldn't recommend it for children under the age of 8, but I know at least one parent who lets their 10-year-old watch ""The Walking Dead"", so I guess that's up to you as a parent to decide if you think this will be too frightening for them. The stop motion animation is very well done and looks gorgeous, not at all like some of that jittery stuff you're used to seeing in those Rankin/Bass Christmas specials. The animation is quite smooth here, almost a bit too smooth for my taste, but I digress. Even in the realm of stop-motion, which is always pretty striking this one stands out. There is a particular effect towards the end of the film that looks like stop motion cloth was used to make clouds shaped like a face that stuck with me long after the film was over. It's so well done and unique... and I have no idea how they did it. I also very much appreciated the visual style of this film, which is very distinct. I suppose all stop-motion films look quite distinct, but once again, there's something about this one that makes it really stand out. This film in particular will look really great on Blu-ray and I would recommend you see it in 3D if possible (from what I saw, it would be a lot on fun in 3D). (2-D Theatrical version on the big screen, August 28th, 2012)"
75,ParaNorman,8,13 October 2014,A Good Family Animation,"ParaNorman is a very good family animated comedy-horror film. I believe this one will become a Halloween classic. This movie is right up there with Corpse Bride, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Frankenweenie and Hotel Transylvania. This movie is well worth watching (even if you only see it once in your life).There are a few hints towards adult references so even if you are not a kid or teen anymore you should get a few laughs out of the film. The movie is not adult content (rated R) remember it is rated PG so even the kids can watch and enjoy this film.8.5/10"
76,ParaNorman,9,2 October 2014,ParaNorman Activity.,"With Halloween coming up,I started searching round for a Horror title which a friend could watch with her family.Searching round for a suitable title,I suddenly remembered seeing the trailer for a wonderful-looking animated Horror,which led to me getting ready to meet a paranormal Norman.The plot:Ever since his grandmother's death, Norman Babcock has found that he's been able to talk and see the death,with his grandmother returning as a ghost,and revealing to Norman that she has come back,thanks to making a promise that she would always be there for him.Attempting to tell his family about his new found skill,Babcock finds his claims being completely dismissed,with his family seeing his ghostly activities as part of the grieving process that Norman is going through over the death of his grandmother.Along with his family,Norman finds himself getting labelled a freak by almost everyone at school,with the only person prepared to be Norman's friend,being school outcast Neil Downe.To mark the 300th anniversary of a witch being executed in the town,the residence of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts, decide to stage a school play re-enactment,with Norman being given a background role.As he finds himself getting bored to death standing in the background,Norman begins to see 'signs' which start to hint that the witch's cause may be about to return.View on the film:For the stylish appearance of the film,co-directors Sam Fell and Chris Butler (who also wrote the screenplay) expertly combined CGI with Claymation,as Fell and Butler show Norman's awkward personality with the wonderfully off-beat clay animation,which is matched by the director's sharp CGI facial animation.Giving the movie a real creepy atmosphere,the director's use burning purples and wild splashes of yellow to show a Gothic world slowly creeping into the town.With the Horror element of the movie,writer Chris Butler shows that he is unafraid to treat the children seeing the film as adults,thanks to Butler mixing hilarious slap-stick Comedy and sight gags with a superb Horror bite,which goes from an unexpectedly chilling hanging,to some rather wonderful wacky zombies.Keeping away from taking the easy option of making the movies heart sickly sweet,Butler instead gradually takes his time in showing Norman gain a real sense of self confidence,as he finds himself having to take on the unknown for the first time in his life.Giving the character a perfect loser-turns-hero voice, Kodi Smit- McPhee gives an excellent performance as Norman,with Smit-McPhee really capturing the uncertainty in Norman's voice,whilst Jodelle Ferland strikes a chill with the forceful voice of Aggie,as Norman sets out to find the cause behind the paranormal activities."
77,ParaNorman,6,24 September 2014,An Enjoyable Animated Romp,"This is a bit of your stereo-typical animated movie whose main character is the typical geek/loner/loser who turns hero. Others that come to mind of the same style are How To Train Your Dragon and A Bug's Life.ParaNorman starts off pretty slow in all honesty with just a few funny moments, but it does actually get much funnier and better as it goes on. Even a couple of the characters that you want something bad to happen to, you end up liking at the end and actually turn out to be the funnier of the characters.I'd say this movie is aimed more towards the older kids purely because of scare content. The language is nothing that they haven't heard before from regular TV programming and some of the more ""adult"" jokes will just go right over the heads of the younger viewers, so parents don't have to worry about anything their kids aren't supposed to see/hear.This is a very decent, enjoyable family animated movie and is definitely worth a watch."
78,ParaNorman,7,17 September 2014,Everything in this movie is carefully and beautifully crafted.,"ParaNorman (2012) is possibly one of the best animated halloween movies for all ages that you can find and it sure is in my own list. With plenty of virtuous and classic horror elements from the beginning until the end, the movie as a whole is a little dramatic yet quite an amusing adventure. Everything in this movie is carefully and beautifully crafted. Each of the distinct characteristics of the characters are usually funny but they are also charming and endearing in their own ways. All these, cordially invite us to live a Norman life in the claymation world which is a reflection of our reality but the true fear in this film is fear itself, not the curse of the witch or the resurrection of the dead.It's true that people often make mistakes when they are afraid or lost as they have decided to do and said terrible things during those circumstances and although unpleasant things such as bullies, assumptions and accusations cannot be completely avoided, there will still always someone out there for every one of us; we just have to have faith. Biggest lesson from this movie? It's okay to be weird, abnormal, whatever the society thinks as long we are true to ourselves and we do not harm another soul. And, we must never take our loved ones for granted. Remember that trust, patience and communication are equally important. #Weirdwins!"
79,ParaNorman,9,21 June 2014,Super Fun,"After 163 reviews posted here there isn't much left to write about this movie --- other than it is great fun.I noticed in some other reviews here there is a question on it's ""family appropriateness"". I disagree with them considering whats on daily TV. And the joke at the end goes by so quickly I didn't even realize it until I read some reviews.Altogether 'Paranorman' is a funny and suspenseful flick with a great use of non-computer graphic technology for the characters and some really spooky and gross-out scenes the tween set will enjoy.And somewhere in the story is message for us all."
80,ParaNorman,8,25 April 2014,"Mom, tell the Zombie to stop saying stuff about me!","The medium of animated films has really gone through the roof in the last 20 years. There was a time when Disney was the only reliable source for such colourful frolics. Now we are blessed with a whole raft of film makers creating their own animated films born out by their personal visions. One of the benefits of this ""branching out"" has been the rise in the animated horror comedy, right up there with the best of them in recent times is ParaNorman.Norman Babcock is considered to be the weird kid in town, you see he claims to see ghosts. Little do the residents of this New England haven know it, but they will soon need Norman to break a centuries old witches curse or they are all doomed!Picture unfolds in a delightfully quirky nature, with the makers showing great love and respect to both the genres it appertains to. As with the best animated films, ParaNorman manages to be an all encompassing family friendly production. The chilly thrills are the right side of child friendly, the animation craft superb, while the humour is smart and the Gothic atmosphere surrounding the tale is pitch perfect. It all builds nicely to a bona fide thrilling finale, where the visual spectacle sits comfortably with the emotional beats of the film. Lovely, intelligent and spooky into the bargain. 8/10"
81,ParaNorman,8,10 March 2014,"Combining cliché with originality, and making it work","The basic freak/outcast kid that saves the day has been told by the American cinema more than once before. The ""have the courage to be yourself"" massage is long familiar to us all. And so are many of the side ingredients in this story and still we get some very original twists to the story making it all worth seeing and seeing again. We've got some very original zombies and probably the most original witch I've ever seen on cinema. The mix works very nicely. I mean even though much is following the perfect cliché of the family sitcom, with or without the horror elements added (while being more funny than scary), the originality of the other parts in the mix, with a very fresh type of an unpopular boy for the lead, who's very well written, and performed by the voice actor, makes up for whatever we feel like we've seen before. And it's clever enough for adults to watch without feeling the cringe of a patronizing director, scriptwriter trying too hard to educate us."
82,ParaNorman,9,21 February 2014,Very Funny and Creepy!,"Based on the trailers, I never thought ParaNorman would be a great film. But from the studio that made the delightful Coraline, I am not surprised that this film is good. It is effectively able to blend comedy and horror together in a very good way. There are many more adult jokes than I expected and some may not be suitable for kids. Also, the animation is crisp and clear and that makes the film very good to look at.Chris Butler's film is about a misunderstood boy who has the power to communicate with the dead. Essentially working all alone, he must save his town from a prophecy that will raise the living dead and spread doom on town.This film has a very good voice cast. Led by the likes of Anna Kendrick, Kodi Smit-Mcphee, John Goodman, and Casey Affleck, they all had their own charms to the film and that makes for likable characters.Overall, this is a very good film and much better than I anticipated. In fact, it's one of the better animated films of 2012. Just be warned, there are some mature stuff here and the last joke in particular may catch some people off-guard. This film is funny and legit creepy. A perfect film to watch with the family on Halloween. I rate this film 9/10."
83,ParaNorman,5,31 January 2014,"Great messages, but not subtle.","Funny one-liners. Great messages and sociological commentary on human nature, prejudice, mob mentalities, fear, trauma, and common human experiences. However, the plot and the script were forced- they were too on the nose. Perhaps this movie is better for children as they generally can't pick up on nuances or symbolism; but for an adult, being spoon-fed the message, instead of being able to extrapolate it or come to your own conclusions on what lessons to learn from a story is simply not as fun. What's fun is when you have an aha moment, or a revelation, and you're part of the creative and philosophical process. So unfortunately, despite the great messages- ones I agree with- I still found that continuing to watch an animated lecture/sermon was tedious."
84,ParaNorman,8,10 November 2013,The Real Reasons Zombies Exist,"I watch a wide variety of animation with my family and always enjoy it when a movie brings a different feel to the screen. I was a bit trepidatious at the opening scene because the animation style combined with the darker content had the potential to be a bit scary. My 10- year-old, who happens to be a fan of zombies, was up to it though.The film mixes a variety of historical contexts with the recurring moral difficulties of our social existence. It does this with just the right amount of slapstick woven with seriousness to maintain the thread nearly to the end. The last bits of the movie unravel a bit while wrapping up the antagonisms. The thread of slapstick/seriousness separates, but the ending still has a great point to get across: ""Don't become a zombie!""There is plenty in Paranorman to keep the family interested and even provide for discussion following. The movie is easy to follow and fun to watch."
85,ParaNorman,8,4 November 2013,A good animation that doesn't assume children as morons,"I hesitated watching Paranorman because it seemed to be one of those silly 3D animations movies which only entertain via, well, animation and silliness. I am glad to say that it was not quite so. Yeah, some of the scenes are meant to amuse by situational comedy and the weird faces or voices of the animated characters, but the story is remarkably serious, even if delivered in a carefree manner. It is a kid movie after all.Don't go expecting some Shakespearean drama, but it is intriguing to me how big budget real actor movies seem to become dumber and dumber while animations such as these, created presumably for children, become more and more subtle and smart. Actually I am trying to imagine this film done with real actors and I can't. It would be weird in any case, but as an animated feature it somehow works.The story revolves around a little boy who can see and interact with ghosts. Naturally he is made fun of and bullied on a regular basis. However he remains the same nice kid throughout the film and that is what the plot is really about. His grandmother's words seem to sum it all up: ""There's nothing wrong with being scared, so long as you don't let it change who you are"".The film remains resolutely positive in feeling up to the end, even when the subjects approached are mob mentality, hysterical fear and the killing of children by said fearful mob. There are issues with it, of course, like what happened to all the ghosts that Norman saw in the beginning. The movie starts with him moving out of his way to avoid the plethora of ghosts in his path, but then they conveniently disappear, except for the ones directly related to the script. Overall, though, I thought it was a nice film.What I especially enjoyed was the effort spent adding complexity to what initially seemed classic clichéd characters: the dumb blond cheerleader who cares of nothing but herself assumes the role of protective sister, the school bully is not as bad as it seemed and the muscle head... well, you'll see. Just so you know that I appreciate any film that shows children that people are more than just a label.Bottom line: a young kid film, but one done right, so much so that even an adult can thoroughly enjoy it."
86,ParaNorman,9,10 February 2013,A great puppet style animation mixed with some cool CGI,"This is definitely the best animation of the year by far. Some cool puppet animation with some great CGI I have seen in a while. This one is definitely not small kids because it will creep the hell out of them. Its pitched for Teenage-cum-adults segment. I am really amazed how this movie got away with PG 13 rating. We got another great movie from the makers of ""Coraline"" and this one definitely as interesting as was Coraline if not better. All the things about this movie are just perfect, be it sound effects or 3D which is the best I have seen in an animation movie. I only have one problem with the movie that it loses it grip in between but as soon as you realize it again picks up and ends in a memorable roller coaster ride. It is just the perfect movie if it had come at Halloween.I definitely recommend this movie to those who are interested in something more than animation with some great adult humour."
87,ParaNorman,3,26 August 2012,Do not take children under 10 or 12,"I feel like I need to apologize to my children for taking them to this. There was foul language, pretty intense scariness and a gay joke. I would have gotten up and walked out but we were the guests of my inlaws and I felt that would be rude. Quite a few parents did walk out and leave though. I am shocked this wasn't pg13. They several times mentions souls in eternal damnation. Are there no standards anymore? The movie was visually beautiful and I'm sure if I was a young adult without kids with me I would have enjoyed it. But to market it to children as a fun loving romp was wrong. I am no prude but childhood is a time for happiness not trying to push the envelope the way filmmakers and Hollywood do for adults. Each movie getting more vulgar than the last it seems."
88,ParaNorman,,17 August 2012,"For kids or not for kids, that is the question.","Every zombie convention and almost every sentimental animation lesson are captured in the pleasant and ghoulish ParaNorman, about a little boy, Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who can communicate with the undead as well as deadly adults. Although Tim Burton might envy the comic conventions mixed with the horror tropes, I would recommend it to any sensible youngster 8 years and older. Others may find it too obsessed with death to be considered light.Norman Babcock's Sixth-Sense-like ability to communicate with the dead, including his ever-present grandmother (Elaine Stritch), makes him the de facto hero to communicate with these loose-limbed, shabby zombies about a curse related to an 18th century witch hunt that took an little girl's life, leaving her disgruntled and causing mayhem for 3 centuries. Norman eventually must settle with her on behalf of zombies and humans alike.The stop-motion animation, from the LAIKA studio artists of the complicated Coraline, is soft in color and angular in faces, is a fine companion to the 3-D, both working to create a life-like but romantic, child-like wonder world. The opening homage to horror conventions sets a droll British humor that carries throughout the occasionally disgusting and alternately comical attacks.And when zombies roll, the loose arms can project through the screen without it seeming contrived. The zombie bodies are so disjointed and slack as to need an ambivalent rag doll appearance to both scare and sooth. I know, I'm making little sense, but the animation is capable of scary and funny at the same time.If it's possible for a moment to ignore the technical side, then consider the film's standard themes of accepting people's differences and integrating misfits into the mainstream. Kindness to others dominates the tropes.A movie this grownup and light-hearted but dark and vengeful may encourage some parents to ban it and others to embrace itI'm in the latter group."
89,ParaNorman,4,13 May 2013,Unoriginally Terrible,"ParaNorman had a unique concept of a boy who is able to see ghosts -- not actually original, where this has been seen in The Sixth Sense and Ghost Whisperer.The film shows the protagonist, Norman, to be a misunderstood and out-of-place student at school where he is constantly bullied. He eventually is able to solve some curse that a young girl put on the town for executing her for whichcraft. The writing for ParaNorman was very boring and several punchlines would go without laughter. Several aspects of the plot were a failure, such as the unlikable characters, some who were also unoriginal, such as 'Neil', who bares a very strong resemblance in design and personality to the character 'Chowder' from ""Monster House"" (which is also a Halloween film)."
90,ParaNorman,7,19 August 2012,"Solid movie, not the best.","The animation is very well done, which I expected. The storyline, however, is a bit stale, and flip flops quite a bit between different themes. I think the writers tiptoed too much on the line of funny and serious, and should have just gone straight in one of those 2 directions. Overall, the movie is worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of such animation, zombie movies, etc. What I don't understand is the overwhelming amount of people who find the movie offensive. I've seen a large amount of people complaining that the movie violates their Christian morals, offended them as parents, among other complaints. The movie is just that, a movie. It's a story. Yes, it portrays things such as zombies, witches, ghosts, and other supernatural beings. Thousands of other movies do the same, and just because this one portrays them in a less serious, less evil manner, you condemn it as being unmoral? Get over yourselves."
91,ParaNorman,8,2 October 2012,Very Entertaining...,"...though it ends too soon.On a typical Wednesday afternoon I found myself roaming around in an almost empty mall. Searching for a decent cup of coffee and a book shop I passed the cinema and it's café.Now both the book shop and coffee were on the other level and the café tempted with it's quiet and comfy atmosphere so I dug in, ordered coffee and lunch and started scanning the movies on display. None of them were really that eye-catching but I watched the trailers as they were played on the wall opposite my table.Two movies enticed me finally , one was Hotel Transylvania and the other Paranorman. HT was in the ""Upcoming"" list so by the time lunch was over I had decided to watch Paranorman (Power of advertising).I watched the movie with only one other member of the audience, rest of them shall we say, had decided to quit in favor of their usual workday. But no worries as I and the other guy were paid back in full for our decision to choose Paranorman on a Wednesday afternoon.The movie began and bang we were in the world of Norman and his ghosts. They took us across Blithe Hollow and into the cursed world of the town's witch. Along the way we learned a thing or two about outcasts, fears of grownups, bravery of children, about equality for all and in the space of maybe 5 seconds, we also learned how the world we have created for ourselves today is far worse and far more horrible than any of the horrors that could be imagined about three hundred years ago.In itself the movie played out quite a lot of messages both subliminal and blatantly obvious and though the 3D effects were hugely entertaining I wouldn't recommend this for kids below 13 they wouldn't understand the more enjoyable side of Paranorman which is the whole movie actually.I did however leave the cinema with a feeling that there was a bit more room for story development.Though played out well overall, the end looked like it was rolled in a rush: In a couple of scenes during the climax some characters were kept out and given the context the whole thing looked out of place.Overall though I loved Paranorman so much so I can risk watching it one more time in an empty theater.No jokes."
92,ParaNorman,6,30 September 2012,Not as good as Coraline but better than others this year.,"I saw Paranorman yesterday in 2D and lets just say I enjoyed it. But not as much as Coraline. I don't really know WHY though, I just found Coraline to be more fun and exciting. The story's about a young boy called Norman Babcock who can talk to the dead and he has to stop the witches curse on the town. What turns out to happen is that ""witch"" turns out to be a young girl the same age as Norman who got trialled and guilty for witch-craft because she, like Norman, can talk to the dead. She curses the seven people who put her on trial and they become the zombies. The first hour is good, it's just a bit....meh....but the part where Norman actually wakes up the dead has to be the best! From then on it's just amazing! Also the parts where Norman meets Agatha/""Aggie"" are just superb as well! I just have one little nit-pick. The character of Neil is slightly cliché, the chubby friend who tags along. Rowley from the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, Chunk in the Goonies and Chowder in Monster House. All in all, not as good as Coraline but still charming all the same."
93,ParaNorman,10,27 September 2012,And the other great animated movie this year is...,"...""ParaNorman""; just for those who are curious, the other great animated movie I saw this year was ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" (2010), a beautifully told Japanese Anime' (Japanese animation) movie that opened to little fanfare here in the United States - much to my great disappointment. What I saw today with ""ParaNorman,"" a joint venture from the co-directing team of Chris Butler (who wrote the picture and also worked as a storyboard artist on ""Corpse Bride"" and ""Coraline"" - the latter of which is still unseen by me) and Sam Fell, was a well-crafted stop-motion animated horror-comedy about the ""horrors"" of middle school, suburbia, teen bullying, responsibility, courage, social awkwardness, and embracing your inner outsider.Oh, and did I also forget to mention that it also has zombies?Of course, it does. But, yes, ""ParaNorman"" is an animated horror-comedy about zombies. In an American pop culture that's already over-saturated to the point of overkill with the living dead - from the hit AMC TV series ""The Walking Dead"" to real-life cases of zombie-style human cannibalism - the question is: Do we really need another (""another"" is italicized) piece of pop culture junk with shambling, moaning & groaning flesh eaters?In a nutshell, yes, but I begin with reassurances that even though ""ParaNorman"" involves zombies, they're not really of the flesh-eating variety, and the film skillfully parodies the socio-political allegory of the best zombie flicks that George A. Romero himself was ever known to offer and turns them into a (arguably) kid-friendly animated zombie flick - but obviously without the requisite gore and flesh-eating that's common to the genre; think, a feature-length episode of ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You!"" with zombies, and without the blood + guts.""ParaNorman"" involves a kid, a bullied outcast middle schooler named Norman Babcock (voice of Kodi Smit-McPhee), and he can see dead people. No, he's not related to Haley Joel Osment's character in ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) - who made a similar confession to a stunned Bruce Willis in that picture - though he might as well be. In fact, the disembodied spirits (including his own recently deceased grandmother) Norman is capable of seeing and talking to on a daily basis are actually far more kinder to him than to anybody that's living, not even his parents Sandra (Leslie Mann) and Perry (Jeff Garlin) or his cheerleader older sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick). And of course, he also has is own devoted bully at school, an over-grown ox named Alvin (voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, of ""Superbad"" and ""Kick-Ass"").Something has to upset Norman's lonely but otherwise peaceful existence, and that involves a three-centuries-old curse that's been placed upon his town by a disgruntled witch named Aggie (voiced by Jodelle Ferland). It turns out that Aggie, an outcast 11-year-old girl who once dabbled innocently in witchcraft, was tried and executed by the town's heretics and she swore a terrible vengeance upon her accusers. Aggie's spirit has been kept in check over the years by those with the keen ability to converse with the dead, the most recent being Norman's crazy Uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman). When he mysteriously expires, it falls upon Norman's delicate young shoulders to save the town from Aggie's curse and an army of walking, shambling, and rapidly decaying zombies.And Norman is reluctantly aided by his overweight best, and only, friend Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), big sister Courtney, Alvin and Neil's air-headed older brother Mitch (Casey Affleck), the latter of whom has a big secret that's just too good to be revealed here as a spoiler.""ParaNorman"" is a delightful little film. The big draw-in here, of course, is the stop-motion animation, a painstaking process where it can take up to a year to film a single three-minute sequence. Regardless, each scene here is so carefully constructed (and it always has to be in stop-motion) that there is no scene here worthy of being trimmed as excessive fat. The whole thing just looks fantastic!The filmmakers aren't afraid to make ""ParaNorman"" a little bit scary for young children, even though, obviously, it's still essentially a kid's picture. Butler and Fell clearly have a passion for zombie pictures and are able to construct the film in such a way that the zombies can be frightening without having to resort to extreme gore and violence. The proceedings also owe a debt to the works of the late John Hughes (1950-2009), as acknowledged by the filmmakers themselves. They're also able to provide some of the film's best socio-political commentary, where, through a carefully crafted series of events (and in a totally un-preachy fashion, which is not particularly common in a lot of American animation), the townspeople themselves become far more dangerous than the zombies are; we've seen the living dead, and they're us! As another aside about the whole commentary thing, the film's most telling sequence involves the newly revived zombies lurching through the center of Norman's town and cowering in fear at the sight of all our society's mind-numbing pop culture obsessions.""ParaNorman"" is a film that the parents of young children may want to think twice about going to see with them. It's a movie made for kids with kid-friendly scares and imagery, but it's all done with a message and allegory/commentary aimed squarely at adults.Never has being so odd felt so good.10/10"
94,ParaNorman,10,17 September 2012,Pushing The Boundaries of stop motion animation.,"Stop motion animation films are, in my opinion, one of the best types of film you can ask for. From Aardman's Chicken Run to Tim Burton's Corpse bride, the styles and stories within this genre vary considerably.ParaNorman has taken this to an entirely new level with the effects, designs and writing. At first glance, you may think this to be a children's film, but it isn't.Within the first few minutes, the viewer is greeted with this conversation: ""What are you watching in there?"" ""Sex and violence.""And thus begins what I consider to be one of the best stop-motion animation films to date. Littered with comedic moments (Rugby-kicking a zombie's head) to moments of emotion (finding out the true story of the 'witch'), ParaNorman I feel has gone where no stop motion has yet to go.The visual effects are stunning, and the script holds some truly unexpected twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of the seat until the very end. If we are delivered more animations like this then things can only get better.A zombie film with real surprises."
95,ParaNorman,9,9 September 2012,"a more believable take on The Sixth Sense.  yes, I know how that sounds...","Imagine you're a producer at a pitch meeting, and two animators want to make their first movie as directors. They want to work in claymation (Sam Fell and Chris Butler worked on Coraline and Flushed Away - yeah, the latter one isn't technically claymation, but besides the point) to tell the story of young Norman Babcock, who sees dead people. You'll first think that it's the Sixth Sense, especially as the kid can see dead people but no one else can. Ah, but it also has the Tim Burton approach to horror (good Tim Burton, of course) where the kid is in a suburbia where some of the adults and the bully teenagers (that is, anyone that isn't Norman or his fat friend Neil), and when the ""real"" people are faced with the supernatural - in this case a group of zombies who once lived in during those delightful witch trials - they freak out and form a Big Unruly Mob (cue the music!) So far, promising. For me, the results are actually one of the real surprises of the summer, and maybe one of the only times in the past month I've felt connected to the character(s) on screen. Yeah, it's an animated movie (a 'cartoon' as my Mom would put it), and what of it? The filmmakers understand that a good way to get not just the kids but the adults into the movie is through some pop culture jokes (and they are funny ones - i.e. Halloween ring-tone, John Carpenter music, Jason mask as goof, Thriller. But the smarter way is to get us all invested in Norman, and other characters. What surprised me was that Norman isn't just a goofy kid with a supernatural complex about him, and his parents do care about him (even his sister, after a certain point), but feels the pain of being so alone with his ""gift"" or ""curse"" or what- have-you, which he happens to also share with his crazy uncle (John Goodman, so good for the few minutes on screen).They even have the good sense to get a villain who is terrifying, this in the shape of a giant demon-spirit-ghost in the sky that has something to do with the witch trials of the 17th century (the zombies are ex- judges, we learn, who put a girl to death for ""seeing' things), and so it's not so simple as to have someone pat to hate. It has some substance to it so that the kids in the audience, while being entertained by goofy things like butt jokes and a floppy tongue (you'll know it when you see it) they'll want to see what happens to the little guy who is just as scared as the Big Unruly Mob. This doesn't mean that Fell and Butler and company don't make some of the supporting characters, like Neil's dumb-jock brother (voiced by Casey Affleck?!) and a cop into archetypes. Frankly, in 90 minutes there's only so much time to develop everyone. What counts first is that Norman is a likable, sympathetic hero (probably empathetic for most) who finds his bearings and connects with someone lost. What's doubly impressive are the little touches of comedy - the one towns-guy just waiting to get that bag of chips from the vending machine, and then coming back to get it, during the zombie attack - that the filmmakers pull off. So much of Paranorman is witty and knowing of the genre, but it doesn't kid itself on telling its story and creating its little world that matters. It's not about the 'twist' of a Sixth Sense, and it finds a balance between the weird and heartfelt. That the animation itself is inspired, wacky, and perfectly cartoonish helps a great deal. Indeed, to pay one more compliment, if you'd told me this was all Henry Selick's doing I'd believe you without question. From debut directors, it makes it that much more of a success."
96,ParaNorman,8,8 September 2012,A Lighter yet still creepy good movie.,"The first thing I noticed about this movie was how gorgeous and life-like it was, but still keeping the typical stop-motion pieces. On top of that, the story is very powerful. There are a lot of commentaries about life and people. Zombies are people, too. Love is louder. Revenge isn't key. Etc. I liked that it was ""funny"" - there were definitely moments where it was the typical ""stop-motion freaky time"" but... it had some great side-kicks to the shy main character. I love Elaine Stritch as Grandma - made my day to hear her voice! The only complaint I had would be that this movie might not be as strong in a few years, or once the looks wear off. I know a lot of people are comparing it to Coraline, and some not in a good way. This is very Coraline-esque, with the horror being not so blatant, but building. That is what I love about these movies. I think it is also comparable because the main characters in both go through a sort of similar situation and kind of act alike. Both are good movies. Go see Paranorman!"
97,ParaNorman,,8 September 2012,Very well done,"I didn't know what to expect from Paranorman, but I found myself liking it quite a lot. I think the animation was great, although not an amazing achievement of stop motion. I found the horror sidetone to it refreshing, but the characters very solid and easy to identify with. The voice performances were pretty great and very exciting. Besides being enjoyable, and a visually amazing finale (seriously, the last 15 minutes are so fantastic) there's nothing too original about it. I do wish one day we get an actual animated horror film, because this really isn't one (although it not being one does not affect the rating since I never expected it to be). But this is definitely a very good film."
98,ParaNorman,7,25 August 2012,Not quite for kids and a little bit depressing,"The animation was the best stop motion ever done! EVER EVER EVER!!! The story was pretty good however it was advertised as a kid who talks to ghost and then a zombie apocalypse happens, but started to get disappointed when there were only 7 zombies. And as it turns out the story is really about a town that hung a little girl for witchcraft. And violence against children is king of an issue with me and not quit appropriate for kids. Kinda like pirates of Caribbean 3 when they were hanging young children, i walked.So when it went from a zombie apocalypse story to a story against bullying and hanging a little girl for Witch craft I started not liking it. Interesting enough all of the Christians that commented here have spoken out against the Jock being gay but made no mention of having issues with hanging kids. I guess we might be still on the cusp of another dark age.Anyway I would watch it first on your own and then decide how you feel your kids would like it. Unlike everyone else who insists they know whats best for you and want to tell you what you should or shouldn't watch. I ask that you see it yourself and formulate your own opinion."
99,ParaNorman,10,20 August 2012,"If you want to see a family horror movie done the right way, this one is what will hold up as the standard both as a family horror flick and as a 3D movie.","It's pretty hard to go into this movie and not know what it's about. The trailers do a decent job of setting expectations, giving the audience a clue as to how much fun this movie is going to be without going so far as to ruin it. Like a skilled pusher, they give you a taste & then you're on the hook for more, unable to resist wanting to see this. Even people outside the targeted audience are clamoring to check it out. The thing is, it's WAY better than you think! I went in a couple days late, I'd not seen a lot of discussion on the flick, but comments were favorable, not that it really mattered because like I said, it looked great! If you follow my blog then you saw me post about ParaNorman being worth seeing and tossing you it's website. Hopefully you went to check it out because they have some fun things on there including a mobile game, info on the characters, info on the people who made the movie, it's a good pre-show experience. If you haven't seen it yet, go check out the site: http://www.paranorman.com/ And don't forget to hit up the production company's website which looks pretty cool as well: http://www.laika.com/ Without giving anything away... The story is about a kid who can see and talk with the deceased, but he's used to it and it's like they are just normal people. There's this curse on the town and it's his time to use his gift to help save everyone after his creepy uncle who has the same gift ends up passing on. Norman is joined by a typical group of ""friends"" to help him along, however, they turn out to be anything but the usual lot after all which does a lot for the movie. The film is full of scares and very intense moments, especially toward the end, but it's also filled with a great message or two not just for the kids, but for everyone; and it hits on many levels without being preachy.The first writing & directing credit for Chris Butler, it's a very impressive mark on both kid films and horror cinema. Previously Chris worked on ""Corpse Bride"" and ""Coraline"", according to IMDb, as a storyboard artist. So, who knows where he got his ability to put something so completely amazing together. The movie is Co-Directed with Sam Fell, who also doesn't have a huge IMDb resume just yet, other than the hit ""The Tale of Despereaux"". Another thing of note is the music which was really impressive. I don't know too many films that had me paying any attention at all to the score they way this did and this just stirred something in me, especially how it added to the movie - so I have to mention it.I didn't recognize a ton of names in the cast, but they all did a great job. My only issue with the movie is that the mom's face looked really weird to me for some reason. It kind of reminded me of someone who might have had dental work done recently and just had this deformation from swelling or something. Oh and John Goodman's character has this beard that reminded me of one of those shag type carpets that are so popular these days. So nothing really big deal to dislike, and nothing took me out of the story.Anyone who goes to check out this flick is going to have a lot of fun! I saw it in 3D and that was exceptionally done with the right depth and not just as a gimmick. Not to mention I got a sweet pair of special green ParaNorman 3D glasses! As for this being a movie for the whole family... I went and saw it with my 8 year old daughter. I saw someone post it would be scary for kids, and I can totally see what they are talking about, but she loved it! The movie is intense and it's not your typical family fun flick. They did a great job with this movie, giving everyone something to enjoy, they pushed the intensity though and that's the part that might get to a child if they scare easily. However, there's no real gore or anything, the zombies are a bit scary but fun, and it is a cartoon so...I highly suggest going to see this in theaters, the scope of the film and the intensity of it makes it one of those movies you don't want to pass up while it's out there. Especially the 3D aspect of it. If you want to see a family horror movie done the right way, this one is what will hold up as the standard both as a family horror flick and as a 3D movie. It's a great opening to the Halloween season of films and while I'm looking forward to the other similar type of movies coming along here in the next month, this one sets the bar pretty high! Enjoy the horror my friends! - Mr. Frights http://www.facebook.com/frights"
100,ParaNorman,10,20 August 2012,A misunderstood kid who can see things that other people can't finds himself responsible for saving those that don't believe him.,"I went into the theater with high expectations. I thought the idea for this movie was unique and the dark aspect of it appealed to me. Even though my expectations were high, it exceeded them beyond belief! This movie was perfect in every way. The humor was somewhat adult at times, but not too inappropriate. ParaNorman was touching, funny and entertaining. I felt that I could really relate to Norman and rooted for his character the entire movie. I was also pleased by the character development of some of the more shallow characters, and I was delightfully surprised many times during the movie. But I will say this is a darker kid's film so there are a few parts that could possibly disturb younger children. Every child is different, and some will be able to handle it better but I'd say if your child is easily scared maybe hold off on seeing it. Kids over 10 should be just fine though. If you think it would be too much for your children, go see it without them for yourself. I promise you won't regret it!"
101,ParaNorman,10,19 August 2012,great movie for the whole family to enjoy,ParaNorman is the kind of movie that you would think this won't be any good but you would be wrong this movie is for the whole family. you will enjoy seeing this wonderful movie that will leave you saying WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW. that is how good ParaNorman is you will love taking your kids to see this once in a life time amazing movie for everyone to enjoy this is one of those movie that you just wish would never end take your kids take everyone to go see the best movie in the whole world this is a great movie for everyone get a ticket everyone to go see the film that will get you cheering loud for this wonderful movie go go go go go see this funny movie that i know you will enjoy . if your kids like scary movies and you guys and girl like funny movies than this is a movie that is for all of you this is a great movie and the kids will get Green or Blue 3D Glasses if they still have some left because that may of ran out of them this is a blockbuster movie for sure 100 percent you need to see this movie in 3D it is like the best 3D movie i have ever seen i hope you think it to enjoy the movie everyone GOODBUY
102,ParaNorman,7,18 August 2012,Perfect movie for kids and family,"Plot revealed: Since long humans have explored the possibility of afterlife. This movie wraps that concept in a nice way for all the kids out there. The concept of Paranorman seems to be borrowed from the famous movie, 'Sixth Sense'. Norman is a kid in a normal middle class family with people who do normal jobs and live a normal life. But Norman is no normal kid. He can see ghosts and talk to them which make everyone think that he is creepy and weird. Norman tries to find acceptance in the society with his super powers and that is what the movie is all about. Apparently, in movies the only way to do this is by being a hero and that's what our Norman does :-).Paranorman succeeds in getting its crazy characters to fit perfectly in their shoes. This movie is a perfect example of how innovative movies should be produced. It manages to come up with hilarious sequences that will leave you in fits of laughter and like all movies for kids this one ends with a good lesson. The best thing about the movie has to be the funny scenes, but like all movies, I would think what mattered the most for me was the well thought off plot. I absolutely loved the way Norman puts his thoughts together to convey the town people to *not* do something by showing them how that was wrong. This movie doesn't have great 3D-effects like the ""Madagascar-3"" so it wouldn't matter if you watch it in 2D or 3D. But what this movie provides is a great value for your time.My suggestion: This is a perfect family movie with a lesson for everyone in a family and probably the best show to go for this weekend."
103,ParaNorman,1,5 September 2012,Deceiving... not really a kid's movie.,"It sucked. When you see the trailers, you'd think it's just another cool kids movie you would bring the whole family to see. That's not the case here. It's pretty dark and I don't know how the crap they snuck away with a PG rating. I even talked to some Coraline fans and they didn't like Paranorman. The storyline was okay, nothing too spectacular, but the producers tried too hard to appeal to all audiences. Disney and Pixar can make adults laugh because of clean references and clean inside jokes that only adults can understand, or recognize from their childhood. These folks here feel that in order to appeal to the adult audiences they need throw a gay character in there. Yeah, that's right. They don't throw in the subtle jokes, they blatantly push their agenda into a kid's film. Save it for the adult-oriented films. I don't want my 9 year old kid to ask why Mitch had a boyfriend on the way home from the theater. That's something I would prefer to bring up later. Don't watch this movie, unless you're into that kind of stuff and want to drag your kids down with you. Stick with Disney/Pixar movies if you want a good, WHOLESOME animated film for the whole family. And no, I'm not from Utah."
104,ParaNorman,2,7 February 2013,Movie not for children,"My five year old and I watched this movie almost two weeks ago. I found parts of it rather disturbing. The fact that they killed a little girl, and her vengeful spirit comes back to take revenge on those involved is way beyond creepy. My five year old is now afraid to be alone at night time. He is even afraid to go to sleep because he doesn't wan't the scary, and I definitely mean scary, looking spirit to show up and get him. I'm very disappointed that there is no warning that there are scenes that some viewers may find disturbing. This movie should have been rated PG13! I will definitely be extremely wary the next time I purchase or watch a movie from this company, producer, director!"
105,ParaNorman,6,3 September 2012,"Despite an uneven middle, I mainly liked ParaNorman","I had been waiting to see this movie since I saw the trailer several months ago though my friend wasn't so enthused since he felt it was too weird for his tastes especially when it was mentioned it was from the makers of Coraline. Both of us have now seen ParaNorman and while my friend liked it enough, I have to admit that while I liked the way it began and ended, the middle seemed to have too much going on that it was a while before I knew what was what and some of the characters besides Norman were hard to get a handle on. Still, the stop-motion animation was mostly awesome, I liked some of the music score, and, like I said before, the way the film began and ended were awesome. And there were some good 3-D images though I watched the regular 2-D version. So in summary, ParaNorman is very much at the least worth a look. Oh, and there's a nice after-end credits sequence that shows how Norman was made..."
106,ParaNorman,1,19 August 2012,Parents - be warned,"This movie is not appropriate for kids under 13 years of age. I took my 7 and 11 year old and had to deal with explaining sex, adult stores, why a male can have a boyfriend... it was painful to expose my kids to the different thematic scenes. This is the first PG rated film I have had problems with. Never again will I assume it's OK to take them. I usually check in detail anything rated PG13 but never PG. Very poor judgment on behalf of the agencies. My kids were not ready for this. The animation and storyline were OK...my view would be different if this had been rated a PG13 movie. I would just not have attended nor exposed my kids.I was outraged at this film. It is truly sad to expose kids in this manner. My advice, avoid this film completely. Take them to a Disney movie which do target kids in a proper manner."
107,ParaNorman,9,2 February 2015,An animated film for kids that isn't just toilet humor and annoying singing animals,"Most animated movies treat kids as though they are lazy, moronic vegetables who are too young to understand anything. That's why movies like Frozen, Madagascar and Despicable Me are filling cinemas (along with all the tacky merchandise from said movies filling stores). It's great to finally see an animated movie for kids that has some depth to it. The main character is Norman, a misfit boy who can see ghosts - but this movie isn't a horror film, it's written for kids and it's all played out in a lighthearted, comedic way. Poor Norman is the laughingstock of his school, but he does have a close friendship with Neil, an overweight boy who often has words like ""fatty"" spray-painted on his locker. Together they discover a curse on the town going back a few centuries, a curse that could bring zombies loose upon the town, and together they try to put a stop to it with the help of Norman's barbie-like older sister Courtney and Neil's jock older brother, Mitch.Everything about this movie is original and inspires kids to be themselves and not care what other people think of them. It carries a powerful anti-bullying message but still manages to be incredibly funny and is entertaining for all ages, adults included. It's nice to see a movie that isn't all just unicorns and dinosaurs and flowers and dragons either, kids can watch creepy things too without getting scared, and ParaNorman is creepy for kids but not enough to give them nightmares or terrify them to death. Hopefully ParaNorman will inspire other animation companies to follow in its footsteps and get out of the slump the film industry is in right now."
108,ParaNorman,6,7 October 2013,A surprisingly warm follow-on to the Salem Witch Trials,"300 years ago the good Puritans of Blythe Hollow executed a young girl for witchcraft. She didn't take to kindly to it. This surprisingly warm story deals with one boy's, who if this were a live action movie would have been played by Jonny Depp, psychic connection to her - he sees dead people to turn a phrase. Some of the movie peddles in cliché' - all of the village hates him because he's weird, he's befriended by the fat kid who is also bullied and his sister is precisely the same older sister character found in TV's ""Fairly Odd Parents."" But although the characters are stock, the movie's approach to the politics of the undead are original with some of the zombies turning out to be penitent over their false imprisonment and euthanization of a little girl. The titular character Norman ultimately fights none of the zombies or even the girl who is bent on revenge but counsels and negotiates a truce with them. This should not be read that the precedings lack action as the village winds up fairly well wrecked. A little comedy gets thrown in to the mix resulting in a concoction that has a place in your Halloween season movie watching although probably not a premier spot. In short, a good ghool movie for the younger set with a decent moral message."
109,ParaNorman,7,27 August 2013,good stop-motion and good story,"In Blithe Hollow, lonely Norman Babcock can talk to the dead but only his new friend Neil believes him. The town is in fact under a curse casted by a witch centuries ago. Now, Norman and his friends must save the town.Chris Butler wrote and directed this stop-motion animation movie. He is best known as the art director of Coraline (2009) and Corpse Bride 2005). Certainly you get the same style of animation in this one as well. This is a simple outsider must save the day story. It does get dark dealing with death later on. It might be a tough watch for the little ones. It works out fine in the end. It's a good ghost story if the kids can take it."
110,ParaNorman,6,18 July 2013,"It's Good, But a Little Too Predictable","I watched this movie last week, and I have to say, I don't think it deserved a 72%. Let's start at the beginning. It was not very good. A dead grandma, who isn't ghostly at all, a dad that looks like his gut is way too big for someone twice his size, and a boy who has hair that won't stay down, and is obsessed with death and zombies. It did have it's laughs, however. The middle was a lot better. It had laughs, was realistic, and wasn't too over the top, yet not boring. The end was a little less funny, and really dark. Also, it was unrealistic. It probably wasn't supposed to be, but it was still pretty weird. What kind of zombies talk? But negativity aside, let's focus on the positive things. It did clever parodies of famous slasher movies like Scream, Halloween, and Friday the 13th. It had some actual minor jump scenes too, but you'll have to watch it for yourself. The zombies were funny, and did do their part to make the film funny, They were also a little bit cliché. Jeff Garlin was funny also as Perry Babcock (Norman's Dad). Leslie Mann was also good as her part, Sandra Babcock (Norman's Mom). I also think it's good for Christopher Mintz-Plasse to take a break from all of those dirty Rated-R movies that he's usually in. All the acting for other characters was very good as well. By the end, I was a little depressed instead of really happy comedy fun-time. Overall, I give this movie a 6/10 because it was funny, but very dark."
111,ParaNorman,6,12 July 2013,EDIT ! EDIT ! Edit!,"Why is this gorgeous and entertaining TEDIOUS film 20 too minutes long? I just watched it on blu ray and while it is an astounding visual experience, it also becomes a tedious and annoying one because of the rambling and repetitive visual storyline. Now I do not want to see it again. PARANORMAN is terrific for the first third; the second third is OK then..... diversions, everyone having their BIG screen 3D moment in creativity, then... what was the story again... then back to something... then they sling a few more jokes, then magically Mommy and Sis re-appear... then what the hell am I watching again...? If ever a clever but meanadering film needed to be 73 minutes instead of 93 this is it. Dumbo was 61 minutes... LEARN from that digi kids!"
112,ParaNorman,4,26 May 2013,Funny bits but not a compelling film,"The animation was nifty, the humor was funny without being gross, but somehow it just wasn't a compelling film. Watched it at home rather than in the theater, and I didn't want at any time to turn it off and stop watching, although I wouldn't have minded if it had been turned off, but still it left me flat. Some of the characters and their activities seemed irrelevant to the film (Norman's sister, the kid who befriends Norman, that kid's older brother, and the bully, for example), as if the filmmakers were trying to fill time. The resolution was weak. It wasn't a terrible way to spend an evening with friends eating popcorn, but not a great way, either; there are a lot of better choices."
113,ParaNorman,5,9 February 2013,ParaSomething,"Here's how interested I am in this movie: I watched ParaNorman on January 26, 2013 and I'm just now (February 8th) getting around to write the review.That's not to say I didn't like it  I did grant it 3/5 stars, but it was, by far, not in my top favorite animation movies from the past couple of years.Perhaps, it's because of the story that's really not that original. Or that the characters were pretty much not fun and for the most part: annoying. Heck, even the dialogue was just okay and the animation was just the same as many other cartoons as of late.That all said, it's worth a watch for younger kids. It's a harmless and entertaining small tale of overcoming bullying and doing the right thing, despite the odds.Norman, who can see ghosts of all sorts, finds his calling and his mission is to stop a curse on his town and is joined by those who doubted him.Really, that's the entire synopsis. Sure, there's just a few additional and incidental story lines and characters, but that was the gist of it. There's no need to completely discourage you from seeing this if I mention the shallow, clichéd and hard-to-watch-at-times secondary characters  they may appeal to those who don't care about unique sidekicks.Probably the highlight (and to avoid a spoiler, I'll leave out the name of the character) is that in a kid's cartoon, there's a gay character. I thoroughly admire them stepping out of normal animation bounds by adding someone real: a homosexual. I mean, how many animated Disney films have been made and, though it would fit sometimes, they never pulled the trigger and went against the grain to include a gay person?At any rate, I would mildly recommend this, while leaving your brain at the door. It's not for both kids and adults, it's strictly just for kids."
114,ParaNorman,6,27 November 2012,ParaNorman.  Good for Sunday,"It's a nice movie to see also not memorable, but you can spend a good time.The effects of the movie are excellent with the stop-and motion. they are the same company who made Coraline.The plot at the beginning seems more interesting, but while the movie advanced almost twenty minutes, you can predict the end of the movie.I expect more relevance of the zombies, too much work for nothing.If you have plans to see this film, wait the DVD or bluray and watch at homeenjoy."
115,ParaNorman,3,16 September 2012,Strange Story,"I came into the theater wanting to see this movie, I don't even know why. It is pretty cool that they decided to use stop motion animation, and that was the only reason I gave it a 3. The story itself could use some major adjustments. The story is very creepy for young children and it touches on inappropriate matters. The witch, who is a young girl, is sentenced to be hung. Really? A young girl is sentenced to death for supposed witch craft. Come on. And then at the end, Normans sister asks Mitch, Neil's brother, if he wants to go to a movie with her. Then he says that maybe Mitch's boyfriend could go too. Are you kidding me? A Gay character in a kids movie? In conclusion, this movie deserves a 3 because of the animation, and definitely not for the story."
116,ParaNorman,1,26 September 2012,Worse kid's movie I've seen in a very long time!,"The character's were UGLYthe teacher looked like she had worms in her faceand stereotypicalthe misunderstood boy, his fat friend, the bully, the flighty sister, the father who doesn't get him, the ineffectual mother, the crazy pilgrims witch hunters, and, of course the innocent, misunderstood non-witchwho somehow has the power to curse the entire townhow does that work?! The plot was Flat and CLICHÉ, CLICHÉ, CLICHÉ!!! And I couldn't decide who the film was aimed atthe animation appealed to children but so much of it was inappropriate. The parents were child-services candidates: ""What are you watching?"" ""Sex and violence."" ""Oh, OK""; the middle school bully says ""why we're stuck in a library when there's an adult book store across the street"" and my favoritethe teenage hero says his BOYFRIEND is into"" Really? Can't they make ANYTHING anymore without a nod to the gay lifestyle? Not even an animated kid's movie? Unfortunately, the theater was full of little 4-5 year-olds who didn't need to see or hear all of this. I would not recommend this to ANYONE, young or old! Thank goodness I went to a discount movie theaterI'd have been really angry if I'd wasted full price for this."
117,ParaNorman,7,21 August 2012,Wasn't quite up to the standards Coraline had set.,"Paranorman was a must see for my best friend and I. I have been a fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas since it's release, and have followed many similar titles throughout the years including Corpse Bride, Coraline, most recently Paranorman, and in the future, frankenweenie. Paranorman doesn't come from Tim Burton, but has the same look and feel to it. Coraline was such an amazing film, and I wanted Paranorman to live up those expectations. Unfortunately, it fell a little short. This isn't a terrible thing though. Coraline easily gets a perfect score in my book. It's hard to follow up with such a great movie and expect the same results. In short, Norman is an 11 year old boy who finds him self at passes with his family, and society as a whole. He is misunderstood by everyone around him, except for the dead who he can see and communicate with. He is hesitant when befriended by Neil, who also faces bullying in school. Neil serves as certain comic relief should the film become too dark or scary for young viewers. Meanwhile, Norman's uncle has been ostracized from his immediate family due to his ability to also communicate with the dead. He performs a ritual once a year to settle the angry soul of a young girl who was accused of being a witch, and was consequently put to death. Upon his death, which appears on film, the ghost of Norman's Uncle seeks Norman out to carry on the ritual. Norman must venture to his Uncle's house, pry the book from his dead hands, and read from the book on the tomb of the witch. While in the cemetery, Norman is sought out by main antagonist, Alvin, who wishes to further bully Norman. However, reading from the book is proving futile, as seven zombies are brought from the dead, and begin their pursuit of Alvin and Norman.Meanwhile, Norman's older sister, Courtney, is your typical high school popular girl who is burdened with the task of babysitting Norman while his parents are out. She discover's he's missing, and goes to Neil's house, where she thinks she'll be able to collect him. She is greeted at the door by Neil's older brother, Mitch, who is just as typically popular as Courtney. He is handsome, buff, a football star, and not at all too bright. When he opens the door, he is in nothing but a towel. Courtney is in love. Courtney, Mitch, and Neil go to the cemetery to look for Norman. They drive past him and Alvin, and encounter their first zombie. After, all five of this film's main characters are joined up and have to find the witch's actual burial site and stop the curse. At this point, a very large sum of the movie can be explained as this: Norman and Co. Arrive at the center of town where they can find the true location of the witch's tomb. At this time, all hell is breaking loose. The townspeople know of the zombies and begin to hunt them. After a while of this, Norman fails in his attempt to soothe the witch, and learns that the zombies are not bad, and that they are even afraid of the humans. (the seven zombies were the seven people who convicted the little girl of being a witch 300 years ago.) the zombies then befriend the townspeople after Courtney demands attention to Norman. Then, Norman, Courtney, his parents, and main zombie, head to the burial site. Norman is confronted with the witch's enraged spirit. Norman begins to tell her the story of her life which only angers her more. He manages to grab her hand and cease her anger. He learns that the girl's name is Agatha, or Aggie. They confide in each other their similarities, such as being different. And Aggie is finally put to rest. That is pretty much the plot.Throughout, the movie is laced with adult humor and even adult themes. This movie was marketed towards children, but is more for teenagers and adults. Some of the parts may even be inappropriate for younger audiences. That being said, the movie deals with death, bullying, and even pokes at homosexuality which are all necessary components to adult life (the latter being tolerance). Children SHOULD be informed of these topics at a young age. And I applaud the writers for being so bold as to include these. Kids need to learn the dangers of bullying, and that it's okay for a boy to have a boyfriend (which should the children be young enough, this could be the first they hear about homosexuality.)Anyways, I feel that the only conflicting factor for young children is that this movie is pretty scary. Your children won't understand the adult references, but you will find them funny. Overall, aside from all the adult theme talk, it is a solid movie. Speaking as a fan of this type of film already, I say that the plot was a tad flawed, but nonetheless acceptable. For instance, Norman begins the film talking constantly to departed souls. This seems to fade out during the duration of the film. It's really only to set up that he can talk to the zombies and also Agatha. Furthermore, by the end of the film, you may have forgotten all about Norman's uncle (unless you were traumatized by him.) I forgot about him. And the ending sequence and climax does seem a bit drawn out. So based on plot alone, I give this movie a 7/10. One more thing, i'd like to see if any fans of Silent Hill can draw the same parallels from this movie as I did."
118,ParaNorman,6,9 September 2012,"A Zombie Apocalypse, Witch Hunting... Kid Film?","I came to this movie really wanting to like it, because of how much my daughter and I truly adore Coraline. Coraline is incredibly strange and has some odd innuendos but nothing flat out jaw-dropping that you have to explain to your child later on. This film turned into an ""explainer"" film for me. I'm still trying to process exactly what happened in this movie, whether it was good (or bad), and whether or not the gay character in the end was necessarily appropriate for this rated-pg film. I am not opposed to gay marriage, but I haven't opened that door of explanation to my nine year-old yet -- this film opened that door for me and because of that, I am a little disappointed in it. It should never be up to filmmakers, or media to open those politically (and sexually) awkward doors to children. Movies that are rated-pg should remain completely unbiased and plain as far as politics and gay marriage go and this movie really overstepped its bounds. The graphics were great, the story line was ultimately enjoyable and new but I truly don't recommend it for any audience under 12 (unless your child already knows about the girl/girl-boy/boy stuff)- Just a fair warning. Still currently processing my reaction to this film but I know this much, it's not the same innocent weirdo kid film that Coraline was!"
119,ParaNorman,1,27 August 2012,Not appropriate,"The plot of the movie is actually very good and has just the right amount of ""horror"" to thrill children. I take offense, however, to all the adult content that riddled the movie. There are curse words and insulting language throughout; for example, probably within the first 10 minutes of the movie, the grandmother calls the father a ""jackass"". There is not only sexual innuendos, but blatant sexual images (a boy freeze-framing a woman's hind side on an aerobics video). And the final words of the movie introduce a gay relationship. If this were a PG-13 setting, I would expect this, however no trailer prepared me for the content; I was blind-sided while sitting in a theater with a 4 yr old, an 11 yr old, and a 12 yr old. The creators of this movie should be ashamed to sneak all the adult content in to a perfectly good children's movie."
120,ParaNorman,1,18 August 2012,ParaNorman is no movie for kids - Outraged,"ParaNorman is marketed as a kids movie. Parents, be warned... it is  not. The movie itself is a fairly violent, scary movie. Alone, not the  best suited for young kids. But it is laced throughout with  homosexuality, curse words, liberalism, and even a scene that can be  construed as necrophilia and adult sex with children. The animation and  storyline, although fairly well done, are overshadowed with these  not-so subtle intrusions. Sprinkle in some truly disgusting and gross  scenes, and wow... what a movie for young kids.  I was truly appalled and outraged at this film. It is truly sad if this  is what kids films have become. My advice, avoid this film completely.  Take the kiddos to see a good-hearted and quality film like Diary of a  Wimpy Kid."
121,ParaNorman,4,20 September 2014,tedious,"I really wanted to like this as I enjoy this type of animation.I feel like the trailers and marketing for this movie were very misleading. It wasn't at all what I was expecting. It didn't seem to be geared to either children or adults - it felt like it didn't know what sort of audience it wanted to target, and so it ended up missing the mark on all counts.It was very slow and tedious...there were some amusing bits here and there mixed with a whole lot of depressing :( Overall I couldn't wait for it to end."
122,ParaNorman,10,2 May 2013,"Pro Healing, Pro Courage, Pro Forgiveness, Pro Spiritual, Pro Witch, Pro Gay, Pro Paranormal","While maintaining a steady sense of humor from beginning to end ParaNorman is a many layered, very profound movie, that, quite frankly, is a masterpiece! Towards the end of ParaNorman, it was so moving tears were coming to my eyes! What an incredibly pleasant surprise! I have to admit that I was concerned that ParaNorman would lead to insulting or trivializing the Wiccan/Pagan/Spiritualist/Paranormal community! But just the opposite happened! If you are Pro Healing, Pro Courage, Pro Forgiveness, Pro Spiritual, Pro Witch, Pro Gay, and Pro Paranormal, like I am, then make sure you see this film before it leaves the theaters. Films this good don't usually last in mainstream theaters for very long. For example, the only other great film that I've seen this year (2012) - Beasts of the Southern Wild has been showing only on single screen in the Baltimore City & County, an area of over a million people! Thank you Hollywood for sticking your neck out by making a movie for grown-ups, while at the same time making a film you can take the entire family to see!"
123,ParaNorman,6,24 November 2012,Good entertainer,"Norman sees and talks to dead people. Naturally he is scoffed at by his parents and his sister. He is an outcast at his school, a freak. His only friend is a fat boy Neil. They are both picked on by the school bully, Alvin. During the practice of a school play, Norman starts seeing omens pertaining to the impending destruction of his town. The ghost of his recently deceased uncle contacts him and tells him about a witch's curse and how to save the town from the same. Paranorman is slightly different from the regular animation movies. From the studio which gave the dark and brilliant Coraline, this also has some scary images and darker content. The characters are mostly two dimensional. The story is good and harps on all the points like justice, redemption and value of family. This is good entertainment. 3 out of 5"
124,ParaNorman,6,18 November 2012,"A nice story idea and some nice moments, but the ending left me flat.","Norman is an odd kid. He can see and talk with dead folks. This is NOT a welcome gift, as other people think he's a weirdo. There is a parallel story about a girl from the Puritan times with the same gift and the town's reaction to this comes back to haunt the town....literally.My daughter saw this film in the theater and talked and talked about how much she loved this film. When it did very poorly at the box office, she was incensed. Now, several months later I got around to seeing it. However, I have a confession....I really didn't love the film. In fact, I was pretty ambivalent about it. On one hand, the film had a great look and I loved the little inside jokes scattered throughout. But, on the other, the entire final portion of the film is a giant downer--and much of the film is not at all appropriate for younger viewers. It's just too serious and lacks fun--which is strange, as the first portion of the film was, at times, quite funny. As a result, I found the film to be highly uneven and one I'd think twice about before showing it to kids."
125,ParaNorman,7,2 October 2012,A children's film that proves even Zombies have hearts,"I was not looking forward to this movie. I new very little about it, in fact I knew nothing about it other than what was on the poster. Had I not been dragged along against my will I would probably have let this little gem slip me by altogether. ""Great"" I thought as I trudged dutifully into the cinema, ""Another over the top CGI kids film produced cheaply and quickly to make money out of Halloween. Even when I saw that it was stop motion I still maintained my scepticism. Then someone said something funny and I found myself chuckling quietly. Then it happened again. And again, pretty soon I was laughing out loud pretty hard several times (Mainly at the character of Niel). At this point I was content to enjoy this as another one of those 'It was alright' films. The real change came about halfway through during Normans confrontation with the Zombies. Without giving too much away it really surprised me just how emotion and heart that had gone into writing this story and I genuinely began to feel emotionally involved in the characters, which made all the laughs even funnier. By the films dazzling finale I was so engaged in what was going on that I completely forgot I was watching a film aimed at children. And by the time the credits rolled I was waiting for the chance to go back and watch it all again.ParaNorman looks amazing, so much effort has gone into every character, every set, and every prop and it really shows, especially on the big screen. It reminds us that in this day of mind blowing CGI that can create any world you can possibly imagine, all from inside a computer, some people would still rather make it all for real, and it still looks so much better.ParaNorman is one of those few films that sticks in your head for days after you've seen it, and is one of the most heartfelt and entertaining family films of 2012, it'll make you happy and sad and laugh and cry all at the same time. I can't say I'm expecting the same from Hotel Transylvania..."
126,ParaNorman,7,30 September 2012,ParaNorman,"Eye - pleasing, classic horror references thrown in and most importantly entertaining for it's target audience, ParaNorman does almost everything right to make it a family fun film.It took a while for the film to get going, with the opening half an hour focusing strongly on the main character, Norman Babcock ( who reminds me of a young Odd Thomas.)This leads to my only criticism. The main story plot doesn't come into full focus until the final half an hour, resulting with the first hour being nothing much but eye candy and sporadic laughs.But the film plods along nicely, never stalling or steering of. The pivotal characters mix in with one another pleasantly, ( Norman's father however has to be the worst father in a kid's film ever )and best of all, the film is wonderfully pretty. Add the excellent soundtrack and yeah, ParaNorman does everything almost right."
127,ParaNorman,9,7 September 2012,An affectionate mixture of John Hughes and John Carpenter. Even Tim Burton would be jealous.,"LAIKA animation follows up their gorgeous 2009 hit Coraline with ParaNorman, an affectionate mixture of John Carpenter and John Hughes. Even though the first act was making me a little impatient, once the ball gets rolling, it's constantly entertaining. Led by an awesome voice cast, the movie shines with winning humor, spooky atmospherics, and surprising exploration of kid-specific themes. It's not always perfect, and maybe it could have used a little more psychological depth, but at least it looks absolutely dazzling. Lastly, even though it's nothing bone chilling, it's actually scarier than most modern horror movies.**** / *****"
128,ParaNorman,8,1 September 2012,Funny zombie-themed animated movie,"I'm not a fan of zombie movies or series, which means The Walking Dead is not something I would jump for joy. Bad memories when I first watched it and it was a marathon with my boyfriend. Don't ask what happened to me because you might think that I'm a sissy and I wanted to try seeing it to know the story myself. I do like Zombieland however and I was excited to see this film after seeing the trailer a few weeks ago.ParaNorman is about a boy, Norman Babcock, who can communicate with the ghosts who are still roaming about with the living. His life is not an easy one because where he lives, in Blithe Hollow, those who are different aren't socially accepted. What makes it more difficult is that even his family doesn't believe his in his ability and thinks of him as mediocre (not referring to the image on the below specifically but it is funny too). It is only until Neil Downe befriends him that he finds someone who believes in his ability and doesn't have a problem with it. Everyone needs someone to back him up even if solitude is what's appealing for the person. During the rehearsal of his school's play, a commemoration of an event that took place 300 years ago of the execution of the town's with, he suddenly has visions of being in the woods but not as himself but as the witch. One of the schoolgirls was right. Witches don't always wear a pointy hat and completely ugly looking.On the way home, he and Neil are spoken to by Norman's uncle, Mr. Prenderghast, and is told of his duty to protect the town as his uncle has been doing for years. Its both weird and funny how Neil manages to scare Prenderghast away when he says, ""Don't make me throw this hummus... it's spicy!"". But Norman is left to do exactly as instructed but upon failing on his first attempt and the zombies come to life it appears to be more of a reverse of role.Instead of the zombies attacking the townspeople it was the reverse. Even I felt sad about it. It is quite an adventure that even his own enemy helped him along with his older sister Courtney, his eccentric friend Neil, and Neil's older and buff brother Mitch.Norman comes to realize that he shouldn't be following the ritual but to right the wrongs of the old citizens who executed the Agatha by sentencing her to death because she was thought to be a witch because like Norman, she can communicate with ghosts. It was an unfair judgement. They were afraid of her and didn't know what to do but eliminate her thinking that it was the best for their town. Instead of reading the book to Agatha he confronts her and narrates her story to her tells her that it's up to her how the story ends. He manages to convince her to remember the good times because life is not all downs but it has its ups too. This is definitely important for all of us because if we do think about it, we get carried away when we have our sad moments. We should be able to look passed the wrongs done to us or we did ourselves but recall the good times and look into making ourselves happy once more."
129,ParaNorman,7,25 August 2012,A fun zombie romp that may or may not be right for your kids,"After reading some of the other reviews here, I'm surprised to hear that some parents have objected to the content of this movie.Yes, it's got zombies in it, and yes, the zombies come after Norman and his friends. I think at least two of the trailers mention something about a witch's ghost and her curse, so if by some miracle you missed out on the fact that there are zombies and heavy supernatural elements in this thing, well...I dunno what to tell you. Maybe next time, try watching the trailer with your eyes open and the wax plugs out of your ears. But if you get all that and you're still uncertain, here's the ultimate proof (and what I'll try to make as this review's only spoiler):**SPOILER ALERT** **SPOILER ALERT** **SPOILER ALERT**There is NO TRUE GORE in this film.**SPOILER ALERT** **SPOILER ALERT** **SPOILER ALERT**Seriously. None. There ARE some scenes where the zombies lose body parts, and the one scene of a zombie chewing on an (obviously fake) brain takes place on a TV screen within the movie that is *playing* a zombie movie. But there are NO displays of spurting, flowing blood, and no scenes in which the zombies actively kill any of the townspeople in this film. So if you are dumb enough to pay to see the movie and then leave before it's even halfway done with your kids in tow, then you shouldn't post a review on this film, because you didn't truly see all of it. The most key elements in the movie come into play closer to the end, and you have to stay put for all the puzzle pieces to fall into place.Now, granted...that's not to say that there aren't any scary moments here. Norman and his friends are put into potentially serious danger many times, and part of the witch's back-story - especially when you find out who she really was - was, I thought, rather unsettling. I think on the whole, the biggest theme in ""ParaNorman"" is fear. How it can hold you back from doing things you need or want to do, how it can affect who you let into your life (or not), and how much damage it can cause when it takes hold so strongly that people lose control of their better judgment.So the answer of if this movie is right for your children or not really ultimately depends on one thing: how well you know your kids. Do even campy horror movies with zombies or monsters in them frighten your children? Do they react in tears if a friend jumps out at them from a hiding spot and yells ""Boo""? Are they uncomfortable with ghost stories or anything involving the undead? Then chances are, this film will scare the crap out of them. Keep them well away.But if your kids aren't put off by themes of the supernatural and the undead, and if they like being scared, and if they're mature enough not to be rattled by themes about death and the supernatural...then they'll probably enjoy this. If they're under ten and insist that they can handle it, but you as the parent still aren't sure...save yourself a possible headache. Take them out to do something else or see something else, and if they still want to see the movie when it comes out on disc, then rent it. Having them see it at home with you in a well-lit house during the daytime might help them weather the scares a little better.Fair warning, though, if your kids are *difficult* to scare, then they might even be bored, especially if they were *hoping* to see some gore. This isn't a splatter film, and the mileage it gets with your kids may vary. There was only one family in the theater when I saw this, and even during some of the creepier chase scenes, two of the kids acted downright restless out of tedium.It's not a perfect movie; some of the moral themes in it are themes that so many kid's movies hopelessly overuse: ""Always be yourself."" ""Don't let fear change you."" ""Use your gifts wisely, lest you become the thing you fight against."" ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" Luckily, the film makes up for this by tweaking some of these tropes just a little, and makes for a few surprises along the way. It's great to see Neil, the bullied fat kid, stay relentlessly cheerful and upbeat in spite of it all, and challenge Norman's tendency to insist on being the misunderstood loner. And it's hard not to like Norman; he deals with his ""gift"" as best he can, and though it makes his life difficult, you never really hear him whine about it. The methods used to stave off the witch's curse at first don't seem to make a lot of sense, unless you stick with the movie till the ending. And if you're a horror movie fan, you should see this just to check out Norman's room, which is a love letter to the pulpy, cheesy zombie movies of yesteryear. LAIKA studios did well with ""Coraline"", and they did well with this film. The stop-motion work is very well done, and the environments portrayed in the film are just colorful and skewed enough to let you know that you are watching a horror-fantasy, and I think this one might become a new Halloween-time favorite."
130,ParaNorman,1,8 September 2012,Not for kids and especially not for Christian kids.,"First of all, this was a B movie at best. The CGI was clumsy and the voice over acting forced. The character interaction depicts dysfunctional interactions between parents and their child with the father at one point opining that he wished his son had not been born the way he was. The worst part however was the creators deciding to make one of the characters gay in the last scene of the movie leaving me to explain to a 7 year old why a teenage boy is not interested in a teenage girl because he has a boyfriend. This had nothing to do with the plot or ending of the movie. It was simply a throw away line. At this point it occurred to me that this was the point of the movie. The entire movie is about a boy who can see the dead and how he was picked on for it. It then goes on to explain that a little girl who was just like him was hung for it in the 1700s. Of course at the very end when the whole town embraces him for being ""different"" the older boy turns down a date because he has a boyfriend. If this movie doesn't have an agenda I don't know what does."
131,ParaNorman,1,18 August 2012,Do not see this!,"First of all this isn't one persons opinion, I promise you this is the worst movie ever. I feel like the other people saw a completely different movie. It starts off with a scene that would terrify any child 9 or under and only goes downhill from there. It's about this kid named Norman that can talk to ghost or something. His weird and very unfunny uncle can also see ghost and warns him about some witches curse and zombies that are coming. I left after the zombies appeared because I couldn't take any more of this awful movie.the movie was awful but then the preview Frankenweenie came on and that looked awesome. Im usually not a fan of Tim Burton but this looks really good. Do not see Paranorman!!!! I'm 12 and it was awful."
132,ParaNorman,,2 March 2013,This is a horrendous film!!,"With a pathetic title,this film puts me off even looking at the poster or trailer digusts me.The characters and their designs are awful,the plot is rushed and doesn't make any sense,the animation though looks nice sometimes however unfriendly,some jokes are probably unentertaining and it's very mean spirited.When your kids watch this movie, it will become their nightmares for weeks maybe even months.paranorman uses overused clichés and useless morals as excuses just to cover up their horrible portrayal of death like the main character, Norman Babcock's uncle death scene,foul language such as jackass and an unnecessary twist of one the characters being openly gay.even though there are some funny jokes but it's not enough to make me enjoy the movie.I am very protective of children and I recommend never showing this to your children.The idea of combining the family film genre with the horror genre doesn't always make a good movie.why didn't I explain a synopsis for this film you may ask, well paranorman is not even worth explaining to you.Overall, this is the worst animated film I ever saw and I urge all of you to avoid this and watch something that's worth your time and money."
133,ParaNorman,2,17 August 2012,Very immoral and diabolical message,"I give this movie an A+ on artwork, creativity, and entertainment factor. But as a Christian, I was offended by almost everything in this movie. I'm not sure who this movie was targeted toward, but it was definitely not a child's movie in my opinion.Most disturbing was the underlying message that talking to dead people (spirits), playing with Ouija boards, and astrology are all harmless. Although I do believe in evil powers existing in this world, I do not believe we should ever try to tap into this evil power! However, this movie portrays good vs. evil: ""If there are BAD people, why can't there be GOOD people?"" and ""Is it a crime to talk to dead people?"" But the Bible says there is no good human; all have sinned. It also warns against witchcraft and God admonishes King Saul for talking to dead spirits.This movie makes the little girl look like the victim instead of the perpetrator. And the boy's special zombie viewing powers are coveted and heroic. Not to mention the references to the adult bookstore and minor bad language. I would have left this film early, but I wanted to have a full report to warn others against seeing it if they have any moral standards."
134,ParaNorman,4,15 January 2013,the commercials were?,Misleading. Being a child of the 80s and being a horror fan. I was very interested in seeing this movie. I seen several previews and articles building up the movie. One evening I seem to recall the zombies being in some late night show. Everyone in my house loved the characters and was really excited to see this movie. Everything I saw offered cool attention detail like I saw in previous movies involving the creators. For me this movie starts hot and fades away. Seems like everything I wanted to see in this movie only happened maybe the first 25 min. I didn't want to go into detail of the movie cuz it's obvious ppl like it. I was gonna give it a 5 and the more I thought about it. The more I read comments on here. I thought I needed to bring the movie overall down a little. So it seems fitting for a 4. Maybe I had my expectations a little to high.
135,ParaNorman,7,29 October 2012,A movie that kids and adults can enjoy when Halloween is right around the corner without offending parents...Well most parents,"This is one of those stop motion animation movies that is well done and the fluidity of the animation is superb. Now the protagonist of this movie Norman can come off as a bit whinny kid but he is still a likable character and his friend or sidekick Neil is this really weird dorky characters that is likable as well. There are some annoying ones but it plays well and grafted into the story in a fun manner. Now this is one of those movies where you don't know which direction this movie is trying to go until farther into the movie but that is one of the aspects that sorta gets the interest factor going. All you mostly know is that it's about a kid named Norman that sees dead people that other people can't see for majority of the movie. The humor also works, I didn't find it hilarious but for a family movie it can be clever at times. The animation is so good there is quite a bit of memorable parts in this movie, especially near the end. This is a well grafted stop motion animated movie that the whole family can enjoy and I personally recommend seeing it. Especially since Halloween is just around the corner. But this movie can probably scare some younger audiences without offending the parents, well most parents I think, which can be a good thing.7.9/10"
136,ParaNorman,9,25 October 2012,A great animated movie and one of my personal favourites so far this year,"I have always been a great fan of animation, so I'd see any film or show regardless of its general consensus. I found myself absolutely loving ParaNorman, it is not the best animated movie I've ever seen and there may be a couple of scenes that may fly over the heads of some, but there is so much great about ParaNorman that I didn't consider either of these huge problems. ParaNorman I found to be a great movie, even better than Aardman's The Pirates. The stop-motion animation is superb with beautiful colours, well-crafted character designs and surreal backgrounds. It also succeeds in looking like and capturing the atmosphere of classic horror films. The soundtrack is zany with some haunting moments that enhance the ghoulish surprises that are apparent here. The storytelling is rock-solid all the way through, the ending is thrilling in how surreal and ghostly the animation and atmosphere are especially and the message of humanity in the face of fear is a wonderful one and incorporated in a way that doesn't come across as preachy. The writing is hilarious and clever, with witty dialogue and great references for adults to savour to Halloween, Friday the 13th and a few others. There are also times where ParaNorman has an emotional core, and this isn't done in a manipulative way, in alternative it is done in a genuinely heartfelt way. Some have complained that some parts are too scary, something I didn't find, indeed there are some spooky scares but not overly so and they suited the story and atmosphere seamlessly. I loved the characters as well, they are not the most original in hindsight but still hugely engaging and fantastically developed. The voice acting from all involved is terrific. All in all, an outstandingly good movie, animated and otherwise. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
137,ParaNorman,7,23 October 2012,Abnormally entertaining,"ParaNorman shares much in common with studio Laika's previous work, Coraline, which was more tonally consistent (i.e. grim) but a batsqueak less fun. Both films centre on a child outsider (here voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) who sees the world differently, practically imprisoned by their subjective view of the world; both films are a celebration of uniqueness; and both films are as imaginative, thrilling and mature as kids' animation gets outside Pixar Studios.There's homage aplenty, from Evil Dead 2's disembodied hand, to Jason's hockey mask, to John Carpenter's Halloween theme (as Norman SMS tone). These are tropes so embedded in modern culture that while their specific origin may be shrouded from young children's understanding, they won't fly far over their heads.Oddly, the most extended reference, deliberate or not, seems to be with Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. The climactic encounter is an illusory, existential face-off, at once massively operatic and then ethereally tender. Perhaps this ending feels like a narrative shift too far, given the broad slapstick that precedes it - but it's the sign of healthy ambition that a film for a younger demographic should be as willing to provoke as it is simply to please.The overarching message appears familiar - Live and Let Live - but there are deeper, more intricate themes under the skin of ParaNorman: forgiveness, tolerance, and the difference between justice and revenge. The similar Frankenweenie might also explore challenging themes, but it's to Chris Butler's and Sam Fell's credit that they've written and directed a film so much wittier, more exciting, and more moving than Tim Burton's mundane monochrome creature feature.One last thing. The final pay-off for the muscle-headed Mitch (Casey Affleck) is brilliant and refreshing and likely to cause a storm of squeals from certain perennially outraged parents. To which I would respond: Grow up."
138,ParaNorman,5,19 May 2013,Good but not great,"I thought this movie was great up until the end. The animation was really fun but dark. My kids are 6 & 8 and the movie did give them a freight, but they did still enjoy it. The zombies were really fun and the underling message was great for kids. My biggest complaint with this movie was that at the end the JOC turned out to be gay! I feel this is ridiculous to have put in a child's movie! And furthermore they should have let on to the fact in the previews so I could have avoided taking my children to this movie all together. I'm my opinion the scrip writers ruined a wonderful movie by adding this unnecessary content. So if you are a parent that cares about the things you allow them to watch, avoid this movie like the plage! If you do not care about exposing your children to this sort of thing then you will probably enjoy it very much. The characters are fun and the screams are very well put together."
139,ParaNorman,7,22 April 2013,It was good until...,"It was good until the boy at the end told the girl that he had a boyfriend. Promoting the abomination of gayness is not the best thing in a children's movie.According to the Bible it's wrong, so that's where I stand. Still giving it a 7 due to pretty darn good animation. :)Didn't think I'd like it at first but I warmed up to it.It sort of reminded me of another movie that I can't think of at the moment.As I said, besides that last bit in the final few minutes, it was a good flick for most ages, but probably bit too scary for the wee ones."
140,ParaNorman,8,22 August 2012,"A better version of ""Coraline"".","What directors Sam Fell and Chris Butler have created here is basically the best Tim Burton film in over a decade. ""ParaNorman"" tells the animated tale of (you guessed it) Norman, who is every bit the archetype of a weird/misfit/Haley Joel Osment child (scrawny and susceptible to wedgies) who everyone (including his own father and sister) thinks is a ""mental case"" for some reasonand I guess it doesn't help his case that Norman seems to have the ability to communicate with ghosts. One afternoon, after a day of being bullied, his estranged (and very insane) uncle informs Norman that since he is very sick, it is now Norman's duty to conduct an age old ritual at an old town gravesite every year (from that point forward) in order to save the town from a century's old curse. Norman, as with any child facing a chore given by an elder, ignores his uncle's ramblings, but when he begins to have strange visions (yes, stranger than seeing dead people) he find himself in a real life horror movie, where he must find out the truth about the town's dark secret, before it's too late. Oh, but don't worry, this cartoon is not as scary as I just made it sound, because Norman is given a fat friend named Neil who accompanies him on this quest of sorts. And we all know having a fat friend (sidekick) is the recipe for hilarity, even in the horror genre.Side Note: Aside from the overall cartoonish/but still horror based atmosphere that moves throughout this film like a fog, ""ParaNorman"" also contains thematic elements which may not be appropriate for any child under the age of eight. Examples of these thematic elements would be: A child coming to grips with death and letting go and some very witty, but fairly dark-comedy dialogue sprinkled throughout. So, if you don't want little Timmy or Suzie (assuming they are under the age I have stipulated) asking you if dead grandma's ghost is going to come back and haunt your house, then you might not want to take them to see this movie.Even with a seemingly interesting storyline, still some audiences may be compelled to complain that the characters within it are as generic as the underwhelming animation. Example: Norman is shy and lacking courage and Neil has a knack for helping shy friends, who lack courage find their inner courage. With that said, due to a very cleverly written script (containing some very funny dialogue) from Butler, the generic characters are given an individual jolt of personality; and hence the entire movie is saved from becoming just another forgettable animated film such as (dare I say it?) ""Coraline"". Yes, I realize a lot of people loved ""Coraline"" and it was nominated for an Oscar, but what these same people fail to realize is that ""Coraline"" is average at best.Final Thought: "" ParaNorman"" was made for the multitude of people who loved watching horror films in their youth. This film is the perfect mixture of spooky and funny, with just the right touch of sentimentality throughout. But overall, the highest praise I could give ""ParaNorman"" is that it truly is the most entertaining animated film I've seen all year. And while amongst your ""Ice Age 4: Continental Drift"" and ""Madagascar 3"" this may not mean all that much, ""ParaNorman"" is definitely a film worth checking out for viewers of any age above eight; even if you are one of those close-minded few who won't see anything that is not a Pixar creation or that doesn't have a talking zebra/dinosaur/panda/barn yard animal in it.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

141,ParaNorman,8,18 August 2012,"Paranormal Fun, Less Dark Horror","I love claymation movies and the animated stories they are famous for telling. The Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline, and the Corpse Bride are classic examples of the movies that keep us entertained, make us laugh, and if done right can add some wicked twists to maximize the story. So when I saw Paranorman coming out this weekend, naturally I got excited again and my hope of clay mation redeeming itself after Pirates was sprung anew. What did I think about it? Please read on to find out.Paranorman comes from the same studio that brought you Coraline, and follows the horror path much like its older sister. The plot, for those coming into the news late, is about Norman, a boy who has the uncanny ability to communicate with the dead. His unique gifts though are not accepted by his family and peers, which results in him getting ridiculed and pushed around. However, Norman's unique gifts will come in handy when the departed witch of the town decides to return and with it raise the dead to attack the town. What nightmarish fun is to be had with the colorful cast? This movie is definitely not as dark as Coraline. Instead, the staff decided to swap the warped, creepy dimensions of the spider queen's world for a more country town classic that is kid friendly. Although some of the residents are not alive, they still look funny and friendly to make both young and young at heart chuckling at the crafty design. In fact until the witch begins to wake, the only scary thing in this movie is the subject of death, which for a kid's movie is surprisingly covered thoroughly. Despite this, most younger audience members didn't seem bothered as the team added some comedic moments to mask the sad topic. Even when the trouble starts the scare factor of the movie is still relatively low as most of the scenes are still more funny than terrifying; the exception of course being a few screams, roars, and other sudden noises that can make you jump. Those looking for some cute family fun will be entertained by this film. For one thing all of the characters in this movie are funny in some form or manner. The dad has cranky one liners, the mom sort of an airheaded caring that is humorous, the jock being dumb, the bully oblivious, etc. This diversity helped me continue to laugh at the movie as well as latch on to a few of the characters to pull for them. My two favorites for this movie are of course Norman and Neil. Norman is not as funny as the other characters, but his good heart, courage, and other qualities are very relatable to me. With this connection, Norman's adventure and journey were more exciting to watch, perhaps even a little inspiring for me. Neil on the other hand has that ridiculous child humor that I love. Whether it's being a klutz, mispronunciation of countless words, or just spouting out dumb child sayings, I was laughing the whole way through as I visualized a clay Chunks from the Goonies. The other strength of this movie is the animation. Again I'm a sucker for the hard work that Claymation is, and once again I was impressed. Norman and the gang move smoothly through their environment from simple walking and talking, to running and escaping zombie attacks. It surprised me how much detail they took to the animation, even making the sister's hips sway as she moved. This fantastic animation also matched the voice work from the cast, which may be no problem for computer animation, but is sure to be more of a challenge for clay animation. Even the ghosts floating motions were well done, the gestures and facial expressions mirroring the attitudes of the ghosts in the movie. As for zombie moves, well again the team did their homework and got the slow, dragged, labored movements down pat as well. The editing of the movie also helped keep the movie fun, organized, and smooth in both story and movement as Norman continued to journey through the dead. Despite all the fun I had with this film though and the amazing animation, there are still a few things that were a little weakening. For one the story is fun and moving, but for the most predictable and clichéd. I admit there were a few surprises in the film, one very big twist I didn't see coming, but other than that you see most things coming. The lack of darkness also was a little disappointing as well, and could have helped keep things diverse and suspenseful for me. There are some other weaknesses in this film like lack of adult humor, a few dragged out speeches and chases, and a few stale jokes, but these are minor mistakes that barely affect the grade.Paranorman may not be the most fun film of the summer, but it does its job well. Most kids and their parents will enjoy the cuteness of the movie, maybe even to the point of immediately quoting the characters in the movie. The diverse characters are quite welcoming and the story is a nice fun adventure most people will love. I warn you once more, in case you haven't gotten the message, that Coraline's darkness is barely present in the film, so skip this film if you must have that darkness. Regardless Paranorman is good in both 3-D and regular, though if you have the option to see it regular I would go for that. My scores for this film are down below: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5"
142,ParaNorman,4,25 August 2015,Not for Children.,"Paranorman (2012): Dir: Chris Butler, Sam Fell / Voices: Kodi Smit-McPhee, Tucker Albrizzi, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, John Goodman, Jodelle Ferland: While the theme of normality facing the extreme and dangerous may sound appealing, the whole idea of selling the living dead and the occult to a family audience just demonstrates how desensitized society has gone. Zombies and corpses have no place in a family film. This is the sort of material that George A. Romero made famous in hard core films for adults. The plot is a mess at best with a likable young hero named Norman who has the ability to see and communicate with the dead. This is suppose to be funny but in a family film it just comes off as disturbing. There are only two characters of interest. Viewers may relate somewhat to Norman who must prevent a witch's curse by reading a book. Maybe he should read the script of a better film to heighten the witch's interest. His chubby friend from school adds a bit of enthusiasm that is also welcome. Other characters are dull including an over the top bully whom we know will become best chums with Norman by film's end. The parents are the usual sort who do not understand their son. Norman's sister is the usual uptight cheerleader type. Then there is the crazy uncle who must pass a message on to Norman. Plus there is the spirit of the girl who lived in a time where viewing this film would be considered punishable by death. The ads stress the importance of being yourself despite being different but its subject matter isn't the normal animated thrill it is intended. Forget Norman and go for Monsters Inc. Score: 4 / 10"
143,ParaNorman,,16 June 2014,Pure horrendous animation!,"Family films need great stories to pull me in. 'Paranorman' is about a little boy who has to take on monsters to save his town and family. Yikes! Haven't seen that before! This film contains lots of typical kid humor that isn't creative or humorous in the slightest. Every scene in this film is annoying and has horrendous animation that looks like a rough draft of any animation project. The setting is dark, weird, and ugly. As if things couldn't get any more worse, the voices are squeaky and annoying and every scene is the same. There's plenty of chases, zombies, sounds, and light mayhem to make this a terrible film. 'Paranorman' tries its hardest to add a little heartfelt into the story but it doesn't work. Overall, you get an annoying, never-ending nightmare that has a terrible plot and makes family animation scared."
144,ParaNorman,8,26 October 2013,The horror!,"With the crisis of many 1990s animated movies last decade saved it with movies like The Incredibles. In 2012 ParaNorman showed how animation had grown since movies like The Swan Princess. A boy lives in a strange suburb where he can talk with the dead. The small town had been plagued by things that went bump in the night, and a spooky forest. But soon the dead awakes, and it's up to the kid to talk with a girl that caused the suburb to make an uproar. There are some jump scenes, touching scenes and classic toilet jokes too. If your kids like something for Halloween watch ParaNorman. Also for people that likes history of witches too. The animation is like the classic stop motion mixed up with new technology. 10/10"
145,ParaNorman,7,27 August 2013,Quite a fun watch,"A young boy with the gift (or curse) to see dead people takes on ghosts, zombies and all the grown-ups in his town when he realises he has to protect them from a centuries-old curse. With his best friend and sister, he sets out to save the world.'ParaNorman' is one of those films that kind of fell under the radar. It came out more or less the same time as 'Frankenweenie', which had the Tim Burton juggernaut behind it. It also, arguably, didn't have the best star-cast lending it's voices, so it probably didn't attract the biggest audience. And that's a shame, I think, because it's a pretty good film.The film's biggest strength is that it takes very good advantage of the horror genre  the film is packed full of ghosts and zombies and other supernatural things; the film has this eerie green glow throughout, which is brilliant; and the subject matter, while for kids, is genuinely frightening.And yes, the cast isn't amazingly well-known, but they do a stellar job. All the publicity goes to Kodi Smit-McPhee, who plays the titular Norman, and he is very good. But, in my opinion, the showstealers are Anna Kendrick and Casey Affleck, playing Courtney and Mitch respectively. Their comic timing is impeccable, and it's a relationship which develops so well, and climaxes in the most amazing way.The film isn't without its flaws though. It does drag on a bit in the middle, and there were times when I was waiting for the story to push ahead faster than it was. Some of the other characters weren't fleshed out enough either, and I found myself not knowing who some of them were (when they looked important).But at the end of the day, this film wasn't going to be winning any Oscars. It's a perfectly good animated movie with a good storyline and some very funny sequences. You will see better films, for sure, but you could do much worse than this."
146,ParaNorman,7,19 August 2013,The best animation movie I've seen in the last years!,"""Olá."" I only saw this film a year after its debut. It features a fantastic Stop-motion work and is a great lesson for everyone.Aimed at children, eye-catching due to all the amazing puppets, which look fantastic, and all its colour scheme, it also shows that we should not judge a person because she is different from us.There's the example of Norman, a boy who's a bit different from other children his age, mocked by all and discredited by his parents, and later was able to show that all of them were wrong, by being the only one able to solve the dreaded curse of the witch .I particularly liked the excellent Stop-Motion work by Laika, as well as the great storyline.This film, despite its paranormal theme, is captivating and leaves us glued to the screen, surprising us at every moment!"
147,ParaNorman,,9 August 2013,Another Masterwork of Creative Art By LAIKA Studios.,"From the creators of Coraline comes another ingeniously crafted, brilliantly scripted, fabulously animated & intensely entertaining tale that wonderfully balances its elements of horror, comedy & drama from start to finish and, apart from being a successful follow-up to Laika Studios' first feature, is also impressive enough to be counted amongst the best films of its year.ParaNorman tells the story of Norman; an 11-year old outcast who is gifted/cursed with the ability to see as well as communicate with the dead and the film is about his journey from being an always misunderstood kid to becoming his town's saviour from a centuries-old curse. Teaming up with him in his mission are his eccentric but loyal friend Neil, a bunch of grown-ups & a few... zombies.Directed by Sam Fell & Chris Butler, ParaNorman is a marvel of stop-motion animation from Laika that exhibits no less amount of creativity in its script, characters or humour. The film carries the same ingredients that made Coraline an instant hit with the audience, applies the same relentless emphasis on plot & characters, and is gorgeously photographed, finely edited & splendidly scored.Hilarious from start to finish, the film makes excellent use of its wit to deal with its subject of death in a light-hearted manner, plus all its characters are perfectly voiced by their respective voice cast as well. But the one aspect where ParaNorman is truly groundbreaking is in its animation itself for the film pushes the stop-motion animation into a whole new realm which is skilfully presented on the film canvas by its animators.On an overall scale, taking a scarier concept and providing an original touch to it with clever references, tributes & homages to horror classics of the past, ParaNorman is a very smart, funny, enjoyable, entertaining & highly satisfying flick from Laika that continues the new animation studios' success streak by daring to be different & boldly risking failure in order to find greater success. Delightfully recommended to viewers of all ages."
148,ParaNorman,9,25 July 2013,As human as it is hilarious; Paranorman will warm your heart.,"Charming, hilarious and deeply human, ParaNorman is everything anyone could ask for in an animated film. Package that with eye-popping animations and a child-friendly story, and the end result proves- without an ounce of rhetoric- that there are still movies out there that can be 'fun for the whole family'. Eleven-year-old Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is having a hard time fitting in at school. He's reserved, eccentric and he sees dead people. Labelled a freak by his classmates and a burden by his family, Norman spends his days watching Z-grade horrors and adding to his gruesome collection of zombie paraphernalia. When his estranged uncle (a delightful John Goodman)- whom Norman is forbidden from speaking to- warns him of the annual witch's curse, he thinks nothing of it. That is, until the undead rise from their graves and Norman, with his supernatural abilities to contact the grand witch, is the only one who can restore order.From there, the rest of the film isn't hard to figure out. The outcast must become the hero through pure happenstance, and all the terrified residents of the cleverly-named Blithe Hollow are forced to look at him differently. Meanwhile, all the kiddies learn a valuable lesson about being yourself while mum and dad tag along with fake smiles. The formula is textbook, but co- directors Chris Butler and Sam Fell blend it so seamlessly with the story it feels not only original, but more importantly, real. As with many animated films, the supporting cast can resemble a case of 'spot that star' more often than not, but bit players Anna Kendrick, Leslie Mann, Casey Affleck, Christopher Mintz- Plasse and Curb Your Enthusiasm's Jeff Garlin all round out their wonderful characters in their own unique ways, contributing enormously to the immersion of a film many might expect overpowered by self-indulgent star power. Ironically, it is the only unknown among the cast, Tucker Albrizzi (TV's Big Time Rush) who steals the show as the dimwitted but headstrong Neil, with a chock-full-of-one-liners performance that effortlessly bridges the inevitable generation gap between viewers. The whole experience is underscored by Butler's script; a brilliantly satirical, comical and, at times, masterfully subtle showing that pushes ParaNorman into the upper echelon of its genre. The film's DVD release comes packaged with an UltraViolet copy, allowing viewers to access the film online, on PC and on the mobile. The latest innovation in home release cinema, UV boasts a high-definition improvement over the now-outdated digital copy (although it can be accessed and downloaded in a similarly simplistic manner). Where the latter could only download copies of the film in standard definition, which lead to a noticeable disparity in visual quality between computer copies and their flawless Blu-ray equivalents, UV brings the technology up to speed, resulting in a sharper image most noticeable on smaller screens like those of smart phones.The innovation pairs up beautifully with ParaNorman's lovingly-crafted animations and enthralling chase sequences. And if visuals play second fiddle to story, just take solace in the fact that you can now get a laugh out of Norm's ignorant grandma wherever you are.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"
149,ParaNorman,10,22 July 2013,It's so good !!!!!,"This movie has a stereotype of a lame kid becoming a hero. But I feel like it's somehow different from most of the Disney's movies. It's brilliantly simple, interesting, heart-touching and funny as the same time. The movie has some meaningful messages.It put you on the perspective of the underdog and make you really feel for him. Norman and his friend are so kind, adorable and very brave for standing up for what he has been fighting for. Although some scenes is kinda irrational but it's a cartoon movie. The gay joke doesn't offend me at all, but instead it makes me chuckle. The soundtracks are excellent and awesome. It really match with the feelings. At first I was kinda hesitated because it was a stop-motion movie, and I was completely awfully wrong. This movies is beyond than what i had expected. I highly recommend this movies to everyone."
150,ParaNorman,8,29 June 2013,A long awaited animation,"This movie is something i have always wanted. A movie that treats children like they should. Pixar do this a lot, kids these days are a lot more mature, than some of you may think. Paranorman not only is good for children but for adults. The animation in this is absolutely stunning, you can admire the amount of work that the creators put into this as the movie unfolds the area and lets the viewer become invested in it. Paranorman may frighten very young children, but can be changed due to the quite comedic 'tinge' they give to the zombies.There is quite a bit of adult humor, most of which breezes right over the heads of children and this humor isn't repetitive and is very funny when it is used. Every minute of this film is very entertaining and there was not one dull moment throughout, The characters are relate-able, funny, written well and play off each other very well. Paranorman is a supernatural adventure that is truly a masterpiece of animation and is a definite watch for the whole family, young and old."
151,ParaNorman,8,23 June 2013,Terrifically entertaining,"This sprightly movie is notable for its excellent animation and excellent humor. Fast paced and likable, the movie has a quirky sensibility down to its out-of-kilter design; nothing in the movie is even and even the irises of peoples eyes are angular. The movie is also appealing because of its overturning of horror movie clichés, with nothing being quite what you are lead to expect. It's ultimately a very positive movie that suggests there is some good to everyone (even the town bully has his good points in this one) and, more typical of kid's cartoons, that there's nothing wrong with being different."
152,ParaNorman,7,29 March 2013,Very funny movie.,"PARANORMANThis film was very good... a lot better than I thought it was going to be.I was fully expecting all the funny bits to be in the trailer, but that is not the case. There were quite a few laugh out loud moments through the movie.The movie is about Norman... a boy who can see and speak with the dead. Norman lives in a town where years ago a witch was famously killed. The anniversary of the witches death is due and on the anniversary the witch shall rise again and bring back zombies to attack the town. It is down to Norman to save the day, with a few of his friends, family and enemies.The characters are great. Normans best friend, Neil, is a fat kid that gets bullied in school, he is a very likable character. Mitch is Neils older brother... he is possibly the funniest character in the movie. Mitch likes to workout and has a lot of muscle. There is a great scene when they are all trapped in a library and he is getting stressed, so to calm down he starts to work out with a book in each hand. That made me laugh, as I know someone who is actually like that. haha.There are a few moments in the movie that are a little bit creepy. I watched this with my 12 year old daughter and my partner, but I can imagine that if I watched this with a younger child, it might scare them in places.I can understand in a way why people would think that this film was made by Tim Burton... it has a similar feel, but personally I think Tims films are slightly better.I will give this film a 7 out of 10.A very good film that is well worth watching.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
153,ParaNorman,8,19 March 2013,Animated zombie comedy.,"Hooray! ParaNorman is an animated(stop-motion)film full of ghosts, corpses and zombies. Beautifully animated, but graphic scenes of flapping and dismembered body parts might scare the youngest of viewers. The little town of Blithe Hollow is cursed by a witch it condemned centuries ago. A young boy named Norman(Kodi Smit-McPhee), happens to be able to see and converse with the dead. Considered weird and a little touched by the community, Norman does have a friend in Neil(Tucker Albrizzi), chubby and bullied.When a small group of zombies invade Blithe Hollow, judgmental citizens take up bats, brooms,rakes and various firearms to fend of the invaders with little success. All hope of surviving the attack is placed upon misunderstood Norman to quell the formidable zombies. Some hilarious scenes, but some may prove to be more mature than most animated movies for the younger set. This flick will hold your attention for sure. Some talented actors lend their voices: Anna Kendrick, John Goodman, Casey Affleck, Christopher Minzt-Plasse, Jeff Garlin and Tempest Bledsoe."
154,ParaNorman,10,18 March 2013,What a remarkable and sweet movie,"It was quite a surprise, but turned out be one of the nicest animated movies I've seen in a long time.A story about how being an outcast affects people, how hard it can be to deal with such situations and how people around them react. And it has a hard hitting end which makes this a very deep movie. The paranormal theme was a wonderful way to bring the story to life, and the great animation really lets you see the emotions in the faces of its main characters.There is a lot of well throughout laughs on the way, along with some crude humor. Such gems come once in a while, and we should savor them"
155,ParaNorman,8,17 March 2013,Dead good.,"Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a young horror movie fan who is able to see and talk to ghosts, a talent that sees him labelled as a freak; but when his town is threatened by zombies, the result of a 300 year old curse by a witch, Norman gets the opportunity to show that being weird isn't necessarily a bad thing.Want to introduce your littluns to the concept of the living dead (and why wouldn't you? Zombies are cool!) but don't reckon they're ready for a Romero or Fulci gore-fest just yet? Then ParaNorman is just what you needa fun, mildly frightening family flick featuring seven groovy, shuffling, centuries-old corpses, plus lots of other slightly scary supernatural shenanigans and an important life-lesson about tolerating others, however strange they might seem.There are loads of genuinely laugh-out loud gags (just thinking about Norman trying to remove a book from his dead Uncle's hands is making me giggle), quite a few thrills, a heart warming resolution, and perhaps most importantly, rotting walking cadavers with bits dropping off them, all of which make this perfect viewing for any young horror-fan-in-training."
156,ParaNorman,,16 March 2013,Limbo,"Sam Fell's ""ParaNorman"" is an interesting animated film revolving around Norman Babcock, a young kid who can both see and converse with the dead.Like many recent animated films (""How To Train Your Dragon"", ""Battle for Terra"", most Pixar features etc), ""ParaNorman"" goes past subtle moralising and into naked politics. And so Norman is bullied and persecuted for ""being different"", whereby his ""difference"" is merely a form of sensitivity which allows him to be empathetic to the plights of the dead, persecuted and abused. Norman then comes across the ghost of a dead girl who was once murdered by a gang of adults for ""being different"". This girl internalises their hate and redirects violence back at Norman's town in what are essentially a series of terrorist actions. Local mobs then hound, bully and blame Norman for the girl's behaviour. Hoping to put an end to this cycle of violence, the original murderers of the girl appear to local townsfolk, intent on taking blame for her violence. Unfortunately they are themselves promptly assaulted, again for being ""different"".For a kid's film, ""ParaNorman"" is surprisingly theme heavy: tolerance, kindness, forgiveness, bigotry, xenophobia, individual responsibility in mob situations, violence-begets-violence, hug-a-bully, learn why terrorists terrorise, face what frightens you, understand why monsters are made of misunderstanding, we're all weird, we're all monsters in our own ways, ecological mindfulness, the commercialization of terror...such things are routinely rolled out throughout the film. Epitomizing the film's liberal minded view that kids should be treated as complicated, intelligent and resilient creatures, are two scenes. In one, Norman matter-of-factly tells his mom that he's watching ""sex and violence"" on TV, in the other, a key character, portrayed as an alpha male throughout the film, is revealed to be homosexual. Everything is okay, the film says, so long as you cultivate healthy fears and a healthy desire to understand.Saying the right things, though, do not a great movie make. Whilst ""ParaNorman"" is at times very good, it's also derivative of such films as ""Monster House"", ""The Frighteners"" and ""Corpse Bride"", its script is familiar and never surprises, its ideas are unsubtly delivered, its animation is ordinary, and the film rarely thrills, humours or scares. For movie geeks, the film offers many homages and nods to ""classic"" horror movies.7.5/10  Worth one viewing."
157,ParaNorman,7,28 January 2013,"Great, for what it is",A highly enjoyable kids film.This is a simple easy to watch kids film that looks amazing. The stop motion on the this film is incredible and something to be commanded. With the villains of the film looking truly dreadful which is great to see in a film of this type. The story is relatively simple and easy to understand. Outsider has special powers. Finds out he is the only one that can save the day using those powers. With it being easy to understand it makes it quite an easy watch. The only criticism of the plot would be that it is to obvious with its message.
158,ParaNorman,,27 January 2013,Fun Movie for Adults and Kids,"ParaNorman (2012) *** (out of 4) Norman, a picked on kid who can see the dead, must save his small town when a witch comes back to curse the town that put her to death three-hundred years earlier. PARANORMAN isn't a complete success but it's certainly entertaining enough to make it worth viewing at least once. I think the strongest thing going for the film is the look, which is quite beautiful during every frame. The entire film has a very dark look to it, which is wonderful but the best looking scenes happen when the witch appears in the sky. The green tone that flies through the air and through the streets was just something really neat looking and it certainly helped give the film an original look. I also thought the characters were very entertaining and this includes the weird kid Norman who has conversations with his dead grandmother, various ghosts on the way to school and of course he loves watching horror movies on television. The supporting group includes his fat friend, his older brother, Norman's sister and the bully at school. The monsters were also fun for the most part and this includes some zombies as well as the witch. The weak spots in the film include the final but the entire tone of the film is also quite serious. I think a little bit more human would have helped things. Adults should also catch several nice jokes including a take on a scene from Mel Brooks' YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. Again, this film is far from perfect but it's certainly entertaining."
159,ParaNorman,8,27 January 2013,"Witty and clever, more for adults not children","I'll start by admitting I watched this by myself. I'd even wanted to see it when it was in theaters. I found myself laughing at slightly more adult jokes only minutes in. I honestly found this move delightful and laughed at a majority of jokes in the movie. The characters were all charming and funny, especially Neil.Some moments were slightly scary especially with the background music! But not anything that would give a kid 10 years or older a nightmare. The movie developed quickly which I liked and it was pretty short and I was left wanting more. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience but not too young I felt some of the themes and jokes were more for tweens and adults. Overall I loved this movie!"
160,ParaNorman,9,24 January 2013,ParaNorman: A Zombie Flick for the Whole Family - The Movie Review!,"The reviews for ParaNorman are all over the map. It might have been one of the reasons I didn't actually see it on the big screen. Not a good reason, mind you, but a reason.So when I had the opportunity to rent it, I went in with no expectations.This stop-motion animated (that's right, stop-motion-- not computer generated) film has all the charm and warmth that comes with stop motion. Tim Burton's ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a wonderful example of awesome stop-motion animation. There is something about photographing real objects that lends a touch of reality that is still lacking in most CGI. It's why performances with puppets still exist in this age of hyper-realism; why Yoda in the original Star Wars still looked more real than his CGI counterpart. Sure, he was restricted by what a puppet could do, but you could feel his presence on-screen. Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) recently tweeted that his daughter saw the original Star Wars' for the first time, and commented that ""Oh-- Yoda is real!"" From the mouth of babes.ParaNorman is about a boy who sees dead people. Everywhere. Apparently, this is a family ability (or curse), that has been handed down from generation to generation. Norman is your typical outcast, with rigid upright hair that makes him look like he's always in a state of permanent shock. We meet Norman's quirky Uncle Penderghast, who maintains the secret duty of ""keeping a particular witch's curse"" at bay. It is time now to pass that responsibility onto Norman, who really is just trying to fit in at school.A mis-spoken incantation in a wrong graveyard leads to the rise of a crew of living dead zombies (is there any other kind?), and a really ticked off witch.The film kicks into high gear from here to the end, with crazy car chases, hilarious zombie mishaps, and a bully turned friend (not a spoiler-- you could see it coming from a mile away), as well as wonderful redemption.Tons of fun! Oh, and watch for what are sure to be merchandise tie-ins-- like Zombie Slippers and Zombie Alarm clocks!"
161,ParaNorman,7,22 January 2013,Definitely One of the Year's Best Cartoons,"A misunderstood boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) takes on ghosts, zombies and grown-ups to save his town from a centuries-old curse.While I have not seen Laika's first full-length film (""Coraline""), I think these are a group of animators to keep your eyes on. They may not have the budget of Disney, Pixar, or even Aardman (I assume), but they have turned a decent profit on two films now and have attracted some incredible talent.I know nothing about animation firsthand, but it seems that stop-motion is a dying art, or at least was dying. With both ""ParaNorman"" and ""Pirates"" in 2012, perhaps a minor resurgence is coming? While I presume that this technique takes longer than drawn animation (especially now that computers can aid in the drawing), I think the final product has a superior, more enjoyable look.Based solely on this film's appearance, I think it is a solid contender for Best Animated Feature. ""Pirates"" is a strong contender and ""Frankenweenie"" or ""Brave"" is probably the front-runner, but I would not give up on Norman... I was awed by the craft here more than I have been with the other choices.As far as the film's message, which seems to be about giving diversity a chance, it is a good message. Whether or not it comes through or not is another story. The sister rarely strays from the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype, and the ""fat kid"" is shown stuffing his face with food falling down his shirt... so it seems like they are telling us to give people a chance while reinforcing classic negative stereotypes.There is one line in the film that has garnered a fair amount of attention. I will not reveal it here for those who have not yet seen it (you will know which line if you have). While I understand the reason behind this line getting so much attention (both positive and negative), I do hope the film is not judged solely on this part alone. Fora few to succeed or fail because of it would be terrible regardless of which side you fall on."
162,ParaNorman,8,21 January 2013,"Risks of a ""Third Eye"" Explored","I sought this film out because it was one of the nominees for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. I am glad I did as this is an fun and funny family film using the stop-animation technique in a most fluid and advanced execution. My kids enjoyed it as much as I did. However, the story involves intense horror elements like witches, ghosts and zombies which may be too scary for younger kids.The titular Norman of ""ParaNorman"" is a sensitive boy who has the so- called ""third eye,"" which enables him to see and actually speak with spirits. This ""gift"" however makes poor Norman the target for harsh bullying in school. One day, before he died, his similarly gifted uncle, Mr. Penderghast, bequeathed to Norman the duty of placating the town ghost witch which threatens to terrorize their town of Blithe Hollow every year. When Norman fails to perform the ritual correctly, the zombies and the witch herself, wreak their havoc on the town. Can Norman and his friends reverse the curse, placate the spirits and save Blithe Hollow from a ghastly destruction?The animation employed by Laika Productions for this film is reminiscent of their previous hit films, ""Coraline"" in 2009 and ""Corpse Bride"" in 2005. I was also reminded of another horror animated film called ""Monster House."" The grotesque misshapen faces and bodies of the ghosts and zombies were done very well, just the right amount of scary for their intended young audiences. The dramatic moments are written just right to discuss important issues of bullying, tolerance, and redemption, yet remain to be very entertaining for the kid and adults alike.After viewing all the nominees for the Oscar for Best Animated Film this year, I find ""ParaNorman"" to be the top contender for the prize!"
163,ParaNorman,8,15 January 2013,A disgustingly cool love-letter to the horror genre.,"A companion piece to Tim Burton's vintage horror homage Frankenweenie, ParaNorman retains the stop-motion animation and young, misfit boy protagonist, but does away with references to the black and white classics of the genre in favour of riffing on more modern fright flicks like Friday the 13th, Halloween and the entire zombie output of George A. Romero. It doesn't hold back with the scares and gore either - the PG rating is pushed to its very limits within the opening seconds when a mushy brain is stepped on, complete with squishy sound effects and oozing blood - and it rarely lets up from there as the ghost-seeing Norman (Kodi-Smit McPhee) must battle zombies and witches to save his town. The violence is cartoonish and endearing enough to escape being taken serious, but there are genuine scares which may not be appreciated by the littler audience members. Others will relish the non-stop nods and winks, as well as the steady line of humour running throughout. Norman's proudly pudgy sidekick Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), basically a red-haired version of Russell from Up, is utterly hilarious too. A disgustingly cool love-letter to horror films."
164,ParaNorman,8,12 January 2013,Smart and family friendly with a horror-themed twist,"Ever since ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" there has been an inexplicable connection between stop-motion animation and horror motifs. Tim Burton has been responsible for most entries in this small but noticeable canon, but Laika has found an equally quirky yet more mainstreamed alternative in Chris Butler's ""ParaNorman.""Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) can see dead people, namely the ghosts of his town, a Salem-inspired village named Blithe Hollow. His ""gift"" has made him the victim of bullying at school and because he can see his dead grandmother at home, his parents (Leslie Mann and Jeff Garlin) think he's just acting out and can't move on.The story of the gifted and misunderstood outsider perfectly overlaps both horror and family film tropes, but in spite of the ghosts, witches and undead, ""ParaNorman"" is significantly less scary than Laika's previous feature, ""Coraline."" The creature-feature vibe adds character and a distinctive flair to what's otherwise a story geared toward kids.As you might imagine, Norman's ability to see and talk to the dead turns into everyone's last hope. Norman's estranged relative Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman), who shares Norman's gift, passes a critical responsibility onto Norman: keep the witch, who cursed the people of Blithe Hollow years ago after being condemned to die, from raising the dead.With the unrequested help of his new friend, Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), a pretty dumb kid but one who's thick-skinned and ever cheerful, Norman sets out to uncover the truth to what happened in Blithe Hollow years ago and fulfill his responsibility. His bratty sister (Anna Kendrick) and Neil's brother, Mitch (Casey Affleck), also get wrapped up in the adventure.""ParaNorman's"" top highlight is without a doubt the visual artistry. With the assistance of computers, stop-motion animation can look absolutely incredible, and when you consider the multitude of supernatural occurrences in the film, it could not have been easy to execute. The general design of the production has this excellent abstract and asymmetrical style that works really well, especially in the character design. Stop-motion has always opted for caricature as opposed to realism, but the Cubist slant of ""ParaNorman"" stands out among Burton-inspired claymation.Of all these aforementioned qualities, however, none suggests a unique family film experience or gives reason to elevate ""ParaNorman"" ahead of other horror-themed movies for kids. Helping ""ParaNorman"" entertain all-ages audiences is its clever incorporation of actual horror movie techniques and homages to everything from B-movie horror to '80s slashers. These nuggets are tastefully and sharply included rather than stuffed in, which isn't hard considering the film is a breeze to watch.And you can't discredit the heart needed to make a family film resonate. ""ParaNorman"" uses a simplistic delivery method for its themes of what it means to be different and how that should or shouldn't impact how you treat others, but while it's overt in that sense and arguably even tailors its plot to send that message, the message itself is a fundamental question of human nature. In today's movies, revenge is so often a substitute for a more complicated character motivation, but Butler breaks it down and addresses it in a way that's appropriate and easy to understand/consider.Much of ""ParaNorman"" at a surface level lacks originality, but Butler and co-director Sam Fell make up for it with rich visual detail, clever references and a sincere, amusing wit. It offers something for kids, parents and horror fans of all ages, all while going down pretty smooth. The effort behind this film offers all the more evidence why animated filmmakers are by far the smartest and most creative among other genres.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com"
165,ParaNorman,9,12 January 2013,Just as I wanted it to be: A terrific film with a touching story & emotional characters,"I was anticipated to see this movie in theaters, but sadly, I missed it and was hoping to get it on a DVD copy. However, on my plane trip to Hawaii, I watched it on a small screen with most people. Like them, I was visually blown away because of it's intriguing concept and premise. I will admit that while it's deeper themes may frighten kids ages 8-10, this is a beautifully well made motion-capture animated feature from the company that brought us Coraline.Sam Fell, the director of The Tale of Despereaux, did a fantastic job at making a misfit-turned-to-hero story with some very emotionally haunting moments in the overall darker tone of the film. The dialog is mostly witty and sharp with some nice humorous moments and the writing is both unique and creative. The characters are pretty good too with the help of a great voice cast including Kodie Smith McPhee, Tucker Albrizzi, Casey Affleck, John Goodman, and Christopher Mintz Plasse; the leading role is likable as well. The music from Jon Brion is beautiful, haunting, and dark that it's hard not to forget it.Overall, ParaNorman came this close to becoming a masterpiece, but it's unique premise, a touching story, and emotional characters makes this worth-watching for everyone young and old. My advice to those who haven't seen it, go watch it; it is that good."
166,ParaNorman,7,3 January 2013,Seventh Sense,"The theme of the movie is not that new, but it's refreshing to see it being used in an animated movie to such effect. It plays for the jokes and it gets the laughs. Casey Affleck sounds awesome and gives his character extra life. And he's only a supporting character. Just for the fact, that Anna Kendrick is involved, there was no chance for me not liking this, too.The ideas are good and funny and the 3-D works too. There are better animated movies when it comes to the technique, but you can still enjoy it here and there in this little movie. And don't stop watching the when the credits start to roll! There is a little extra scene ""hidden"" after the credits"
167,ParaNorman,9,30 December 2012,An animated gem for the ages,"There have been many superbly animated films in the last decade, and most made for some pretty good stories as well. However, many animated pictures nowadays have lacked in story telling despite all the advancements being made in both 3D and 2D animation. Paranorman is just a different animal all together.Stop-motion animation is rare and the reason why it's rare is because it's an ancient way of animating things. Stop-motion was used in old Godzilla movies and pioneered by Ray Harryhausen. It was the CGI of the 70s and 80s. However, stop motion is not as jittery as it used to be and has come a long way since the old days. In a sense, it is my 2nd favorite type of animation, 2nd to 2D animation. Now don't get me wrong, I love 3D animation but its just too perfect. It doesn't feel hand drawn and hand crafted. Paranorman features a rich world made from scratch and the details are just mesmerizing.As for the story itself, well, it's very rooted in the characters. There is very little plot here, but full of messages for the young and older folks alike. It's a dark film and not for the younger audiences. I thought a PG-13 rating would have been realistic for this because it could be quite gory at times. The messages are strong unlike some recent Disney films, and this film is not as spiritually complex as lets say, a Miyazaki anime. It's simply about a boy who is different than most kids. Despite being bullied, he still finds a way to get through the daily grind without succumbing hatred while focusing on using his gifts for the betterment of his town.9/10. Although not as emotional as a Toy Story or an Incredibles, or a Lion King. However, I can't help but consider Paranorman to be a classic nevertheless."
168,ParaNorman,,29 December 2012,Don't be fooled by the naysayers.,"From the makers of ""Coraline"" (which I absolutely hated) comes ""ParaNorman"".This odd offering is the latest step forward in the art of stop-motion animation. The sets and characters have been carefully crafted as well as the nifty little story (something akin this happened in my own family line, see ""The Crucible"" by Arthur Miller), which I will admit should have received an PG rating.The film actually teaches a very important moral which (judging from some of the outlandish, judgmental criticisms) will most likely go right over the heads of the very people who most need to take the lesson to heart."
169,ParaNorman,7,25 December 2012,Enjoyable and Fun,"""ParaNorman"" was a pleasant surprise for a watch. It features enjoyable characters and comedy without too much dumbing down or wackiness. I especially enjoyed Norman's fat but socially-conscious neighbor and friend who looks out after him. The jokes and gags are fairly harmless, but you can tell the movie-makers have some fun poking-fun at the horror genre in at least half a-dozen montages and homages to slasher flicks either in visuals or audio or both. And while the ending got a bit sappy and maybe too grandiose considering the material for a few minutes, ParaNorman deserves recommendation especially if you like Halloween theming. I did. About a 7/10"
170,ParaNorman,9,10 December 2012,The best animation of the year....That I've seen!,"'ParaNorman' is the greatest of all 2012 Animation movies I've seen. There were many things I like about this film that easily surpass 2012's 'Brave' and 'Ice Age 4' The plot is a WHOLE lot better in this film than the other two as well as the musical score, the voice acting, the characters are so likable and the comedy is so good! There was not one character in this movie that I hated. NOT ONE! I loved Perry's voice actor and the other voice actors all did a good job. The plot remained simple, portraying Norman as the everyday 'freak' that nobody believes. The plot took quite an usual twist towards the end and I gotta give credit to the director for that. It took a lot of courage to do that and though it may seem childish, I certainly loved it! Superb film, definitely the best animation I've seen and I guarantee its one of the better animations I've seen."
171,ParaNorman,8,9 December 2012,This was very good,"One of the things i love most about animated films, is that the majority of them have terrific stories behind the extraordinary work it takes to make them. This film is definitely in the majority category of animated films, and not only animated films but stop animation films as well. What i really liked about this movie is that you almost can't regard it as a kid's movie. A lot of the humor and content is definitely aimed at adults, and it makes it that much more fun of a ride. I was surprised to see that the creators of this film also did ""Coraline"". This film is much more light hearted and less bizarre and intense then ""Coraline"" by far. This animated film does have a moral at the end of it, like all animated movies do but it's not shoving the moral down your throat the whole time. It allows you to escape from life for a while and have some fun and be an immature, frightened, excited kid again. The animation was fantastic, and the way they made the characters and the setting really added to the atmosphere and the humor and even the heart of the story. I put this just a notch down from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", plus it would be a great movie to watch on Halloween."
172,ParaNorman,7,6 December 2012,"This kids' horror animation has problems, but when the highs are this good, who cares?!","Using M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense as a launchpad, co-directors Chris Butler (a storyboard artist on The Corpse Bride & Coraline) and Sam Fell (former Aardman director and the writer here) create the first ever zombie movie for kids. A simple story, wrapped up in transgressive characters and painstaking, beautiful stop-motion animation, it's ghoulish charm sustains long enough for us to skim over the plot and tonal problems.Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is not your average school-kid. He doesn't spend his time outside playing football, nor is he glued to a computer screen. He loves all things horror-filled, from old Frankenstein adaptations on the telly, to John Carpenter's signature Halloween theme as his mobile's ringtone. How he acquired such a penchant for the macabre is unknown, but the fact that he sees chatty ghosts roaming the streets surely can't help.Ignored by his parents (Jeff Garlin and the ever sultry-sounding Leslie Mann), tormented at home by his older sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick), and at school by impish bully Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), he prefers to spend time hanging out on his own/in the company of the dead (including his Grandma, voiced by the brilliantly hoarsy Elaine Stritch). But when Norman starts having apocalyptic visions of his town being destroyed by the local folklore, he is in desperate need for someone to talk to. Only two people believe his story, his eccentric, clairvoyant uncle (John Goodman) and the lonesome, equally bullied school-kid Neil (Tucker Albrizzi).When his old uncle pops his clogs, it's left to Norman to protect the town from the ancient curse, and the living dead who start to emerge from their graves. Thankfully, he's not alone, as Courtney, Alvin, Neil and his dimwitted older brother Mitch (Casey Affleck) join him on his Hammer horror quest.In a year where we've seen garish animations such as Madagascar 3 and Ice Age 4, ParaNorman feels like a breath of fresh air. Refreshingly twee and small-scaled, it shares the same passion for horror genre conventions as Henry Selick's Coraline, The Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas). This carries over to the evocative score which laces the film, from ever-reliable composer Jon Brion (whose previous musicianship has perfected films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Punch-Drunk Love, to name but two).Whilst it struggles to find it's footing in the first forty minutes, as soon as the casket is forced open, Butler & Fell run riot with some great, zany sketch pieces and character depth. They cast typically against character, with the once wholesome, girl next doorsy Anna Kendrick voicing Norman's bitchy older sister Courtney, and SuperBad's Christopher ""Fogell"" Mintz- Plasse as the school bully. Best of all is Casey Affleck as Neil's older brother Mitch. It's a hilarious, fantastically subversive character: an openly gay, dumb jock, the likes of which has never been encapsulate in so-called ""children's movies"".It's the universally perfect voice cast and stop-motion finesse that carries ParaNorman, averting us from the several plot-holes and heavy-handed ending. It doesn't have the poise nor grace of a Pixar movie, meaning that the anti-bullying subtext feels aggrandised and the shifts in tone between horror and humour often leave you somewhere sandwiched in- between.Let's not be churlish, ParaNorman is a dark-horse success story. A bold feature from the aspiring Laika Studios, it's an unmatched, intelligent children's horror film, where gasps of terror will eventually turn into sighs of love.www.366movies.com"
173,ParaNorman,8,1 December 2012,"A dark, dark, dark animated film more for adults than kids","Paranorman isn't animated brilliance. It certainly doesn't land in the qualities of a Pixar film or true animated classics. However, it was genuinely funny, had a strong moral message about bullying and being yourself and was unique. I say unique because this is an animated film geared towards kids about a zombie apocalypse. My issue with the film is the fact that it is geared towards kids. I think the film should have a 14A/PG-13 rating for content and thematic elements because this one was dark!! The film is creepy and scary and deals with death and the afterlife and a scorned witch. The animated is good, though not excellent and the characters were really a lot of fun. There were a lot of jokes that I thought were more adult themed and I even happen to notice them used ""God"" a couple of times in a derogatory way. I'm not being prudish, I watch all kinds of films and I can handle filth but I went into this expecting a cute kids movie. Still for adults, you will truly enjoy this dark little tale about a boy who speaks with the dead and is the towns last hope against a witch.Kodi Smit-McPhee does the voice of Norman and does a great job. He fits the role nicely and you certainly relate to the little out-casted boy who can't find favour with anyone, even his own family. His voice isn't entirely unique but it still works very well in the role. Tucker Albrizzi does a great job as Norman's new found friend Neil. Ironically I think Neil looks a little like Albrizzi but certainly the voice fits the character perfectly. Anna Kendrick is really, really good as Norman's less than intelligent teenage sister. She was probably one of my favourite characters and Kendrick did this role flawlessly. Same could be said for Casey Affleck as Mitch, also one of my favourite characters in the movie. The relationship between Kendrick's Courtney and Affleck's Mitch is priceless and really fun to watch. Christopher Mintz-Plasse perfectly captures bully Alvin's voice. I'm not sure his character was as good as it could have been but he certainly does the voice well. Leslie Mann and Jeff Garlin play Norman's parents and both do a good job. Garlin's voice is very recognizable, perhaps more than anyone else.Co-director Sam Fell has had his share of experience in animation and there is no doubt that he and Chris Butler, who also wrote the story, put a lot of work into the film. It is a fun ride from beginning to end. I sort of wish that they had toned down some of the elements that made this less than kid friendly but older kids and adults will likely love the film! It falls short of greatness but regardless it was incredibly entertaining, well performed and well made. Just preview it before you show it to youngsters because they will certainly find it as dark as I did. 8/10"
174,ParaNorman,8,26 November 2012,The Vidiot Reviews...,"ParaNormanThe reason children can only see dead people is because when ghosts return they come back in the form of Pokémon. However, the minor medium in this animated movie doesn't speak with dead grannies that resemble Squirtle.When his weird uncle (John Goodman) passes away, he reappears to Norman (Kodi Smit- McPhee) as his translucent self, and leads him to a book of fairy tales.Now Norman must quell an executed witch that has risen to get revenge on the townsfolk that put her on trial.But before he can dispel her curse, he and his friends (Casey Affleck, Anna Kendrick, Tucker Albrizzi, Christopher Mintz-Plasse) must make waste of the living dead that have overrun their town.Progressive yet retro, ParaNorman's ghost/witch/zombie storyline not only contains remarkable stop-motion animation but a generous helping of relevant humour. Incidentally, if a ghost and a zombie ever got together they would make a human? (Green Light)vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
175,ParaNorman,9,25 November 2012,"ParaNorman (2012) - Who Do You Think Sees More Dead People? Norman or the Kid from ""The Sixth Sense""?","""ParaNorman"" is a stop-motion animation feature from the makers of ""Coraline"", that was strangely released in August, when a movie like this is often released around Halloween season. It tells the story of Norman, a young boy who is seen as a strange outcast by the people at the school, and his own family. But, as it turns out, this kid can actually see and talk to dead people. Unlike Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"", Norman actually enjoys walking by the ghost of the recently deceased and have a conversation, he can even see his grandma. But, a centuries-old curse is under siege, bringing zombies involved, and it's up to Norman to break the curse and save the town. You might think of this as really predictable, when in reality, it's one of the most original movies of the whole year. This movie does a perfect job of staying tribute to the classic horror ""B-movies"" of the early years, and pokes fun at the usual horror film clichés. Don't you love it when movies do that? ""ParaNorman"" is also one of the most beautifully animated films I've seen in a while. It's such a visual spectacle, the animators have created the world of this movie with great care. It must have taken so much work to sit there and move the clay-mation figure, one frame at a time. This is one of the best animated films that knows how it visually animate a film so beautifully, while keeping me so entertained for the 93-minute movie. As for the voice talent, this movie provides some memorable voice performances from Kodi Smit-McPhee as the title character of Norman, Tucker Albrizzi as the hilarious chubby sidekick who befriends Norman, Casey Affleck as the tough brother of Albrizzi's character, Anna Kendrick as Norman's teen sister, Christopher Mintz- Plasse as the bully, Jeff Garlin and Leslie Mann as Norman's parents, and John Goodman as the one who warns Norman of the dangers that will soon await. This movie also has a very funny side thrown in, and surprisingly, most of the jokes of the movie are mostly adult-related, more for teens and adults, than it is for children, who will easily get scared while seeing this. Besides, most of the jokes may seem way too far in the PG-13 material, while the movie itself, shockingly, is rated PG. That just shows why this movie was not afraid of taking risks, and that is what I respect a lot. While there are some teen humor to be found, most of the jokes are what the adults will understand the most. By the way, as I mentioned earlier, this movie may look like a kids' movie, but this is for teens and adults only, because your kids will have nightmares for weeks. Although having a very basic beginning, middle, and end, ""ParaNorman"" is a flawless animation flick. Visually stunning, surprisingly hilarious, and effectively heartwarming at times, ""ParaNorman"" is a film that nobody should miss. If you have a love for old-fashioned horror films, respect the use of stop-motion animation, and looking for a good time at the theater, this is the movie for you! ""ParaNorman"", in my review, ""visually remarkable, and entertaining to watch""."
176,ParaNorman,8,24 November 2012,Great Movie,"Did you fit in growing up? Did you have lots of friends, play sports, and go to parties? What about seeing dead people? Did you do that? Probably not. Norman Babcock, on the other hand, sees and speaks to dead people all the time.Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an outcast at school and an embarrassment to his family, thanks largely to his ""gift"". Norman's father Perry (voiced by Jeff Garlin) doesn't believe Norman is talking to anyone and makes no effort to explore the possibility that he's wrong. Norman's mother, Sandra (voiced by Leslie Mann) is more tolerant but, by no means, a believer. Courtney, Norman's older sister (voiced by Anna Kendrick) is a cheerleader who thinks Norman's a freak and has very few thoughts on any meaningful subjects. The only companions our main character has are his deceased grandmother (voiced by Elaine Stritch), other ghosts in town and a fellow student named Neil (voice by Tucker Albrizzi) who is bullied because, among other things, he is overweight. The town they all live in is named Blithe Hollow and it is best known for its execution of a witch 300 years ago. While rehearsing a play on the subject, Norman has a vision of the past and being pursued by an angry mob. Not long after that, Norman and Neil are confronted by Norman's estranged uncle, Mr. Penderghast, (voiced by John Goodman) who tells them that they must perform a ritual that evening to prevent the dead rising from the gave that evening.I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected to. Yes, the notion of a child who can ""see dead people"" is right out of The Sixth Sense but that's where the similarities end. Norman accepts his abilities, in spite of the scorn he receives as a result. Another difference between Norman and the character portrayed by Haley Joel Osment is that Norman is a very optimistic, upbeat; individual who just doesn't have any friends. The supporting cast is chock-full of talented people who add to the story. If you haven't seen this movie yet, and judging from the box office you haven't, please do."
177,ParaNorman,,22 November 2012,Clairvoyant Janus,"We (the audience) are the townspeople, equally prejudiced against appearances as we are seduced by them - this is never more clear than in the case of horror movies, where we voluntarily seek out the gnarliest stuff, the psychos and beasts that we can't seem to find in life. Vileness charms you see.The horror movie in this case happens on the streets of a small New England town, a vengeful witch stirs from ancient sleep and makes the dead rise from their tombs to terrorize the population. (the film opens with footage from a zombie b-movie on TV)Only it isn't quite so.The kid (derided around town as a weirdo) can see the spirits of the dead, straddles the mundane, physical world of everyday routine, as well as the spiritual world of intuition, deep-seated urges and capricious imagination.What is revealed to the townspeople and changes them through the kid's actions, is that we all straddle both worlds, only the two images of us, the two selves, ('real' and who we really are) do not always correspond. The gnarly zombies are really contrite townsfolk of centuries ago, the witch is a wounded child, Norman is of course accepted as a sensitive soul, the school bully and air-headed bimbo sister show humanity....the jock brother is revealed at the last minute to be homosexual (presumably the best the filmmakers could do to grant this character a hidden self, tacky isn't it?). Notice too the schoolteacher who would love to really be a thespian (her own true self), and passionately leads the lynch mob wearing on her face the greenish paste of a beauty mask, a second face incidentally mirroring that of the hapless zombies.Horror movies on TV, horror play on a stage, horror on the streets - each one commenting on the same fabricated reality. On a fourth level, Norman's gift of prescient vision as burning up holes in the walls and fabric of reality, and when finally he confronts the witch, sets her free by tearing down her own self-sustained nightmareworld of hate and bitter recrimination, which is the function of memory.Having gained some understanding of these mechanisms that cloud perception, the family happily sits down to watch TV - only now acknowledging the spirit of the dead grandmother, the two worlds coexisting.This is good, better than this year's Pixar. The story may seem a little trite, because the filmmakers dilute it by explaining away only the most superficial elements. The stop-motion is wonderful."
178,ParaNorman,10,19 November 2012,"Yes, it's a horror movie - but  kids can take more than you think! Don't let your kid miss out on this great experience only because you are scared!","Finally animation film makers have risen to a level, where they understand, that in order to achieve the best possible outcome it is necessary to combine the traditional tools with innovative new techniques.This is by far one of the greatest animated movies I've seen so far!Whereas many of the CGI movies made until now were mostly about showing off what was possible with the technology, this gem of animation brings together the right amount of everything. It's all about a great story which is perfectly supported by everything else. The creators are not afraid to tell what they want to tell, which is very rare in the film business nowadays.The music and sound are brilliant, the actors fantastic and the animation leaves you speechless on your seat, as do the beautiful and with much love for the detail created sets. The overall look and feel of the movie fit it's theme like a glove.But above all there is the story which is fairly simple, but powerful. It definitely is a family movie, and I wouldn't recommend letting your kids watch this alone. After all, it is a horror movie and the creators are not shy to use traditional scare techniques to make that clear. My recommendation of minimum age is at least six years. But seeing it together can surely help all those parents who have difficulties (or the need) to talk with their kids about death.The humor is great and well used, especially in moments, when there is really need for some unrelated comic relief to ease out the deep emotional movement that might hit the viewer at times. The intelligent use of stereotypes and thus misleading the audiences expectations is just the cream on the top.I've never felt the urge to write a review here, but this movie made me do it. And I've seen A LOT of movies in my life. This movie has what I'd call excellent film making!Thank you, Chris Butler, Sam Fell and everyone else involved in the creation of this fantastic movie, for giving us an experience we'll never forget and that makes us being a part of setting a milestone in film history, because something like this has never been done before."
179,ParaNorman,7,15 November 2012,Stop motion animation at its best,"ParaNorman, stands with one leg in horror and another in comedy, the movie had me laughing and it was thrilling, keeping you on your sit as you eagerly wait to see how it will all turn out.ParaNorman is a 3D stop motion animated comedy horror film produced by Laika who are known for their short films and commercials, their first full length movie was in 2009; the name of the flick was Coraline which was distributed by Focus Features who also distributed this movie too.The film production took three years using sixty Canon EOS 5D Mark II DSLR cameras instead of the conversional 3D cameras and its release was met with favorable reviews, Rotten Tomatoes has a 87% acceptance from critics for the movie.The movie's plot was centered round a young boy named Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) who is able to speak with the dead. His regular gist mate is his late grandmother who he sees daily, but sadly no one else does, so Norman's habit of passing messages from grandma to dad or any other person in the house was not welcomed.Norman also sees and talks to the various ghosts in town, which has made him popular in the town and also in school as a weirdo.Norman's only friend is a chubby kid named Neil Downe (voiced by Tucker Albrizzi) who has come to terms with Norman's behavior and enjoys the fact that he can see dead people.The movies antagonist is a ghost from 300 years ago, who is actually a witch that the town executed. Norman's Uncle Mr. Prenderghast tells him that his gift is passed down to him so that he can be able to save the town's people from the witches curse when he is gone, without fully given Norman all the details Mr. Prenderghast dies, and now Norman has to find a way to save the town from awoken zombies and a ghost with who is tearing the town apart for revenge.I'm Not totally a stop motion animation fan, this is my second take in trying to watch this movie, the first time I was turned off by the stop motion animation idea but later on after hearing the favorable reviews that it has gotten I decided to give it a try, a decision I didn't regret making.ParaNorman will leave you glad that you took the time to see it. The animation was a step up from other stop motion animations and the movie dialogue is intriguing.Take time out of your busy schedule to see this wonderful stop motion animation.www.lagsreviews.com"
180,ParaNorman,,16 October 2012,What's the music on the car radio ?,"While they are going through the town after (SPOILER) the attack in their car - What is the Stax/Hi-sounding instrumental that is playing on the radio . please ? I'd like to know what it was .You could compare it to an All Green sound - a "" Memphis "" one .It did not appear to be clearly indicated - at least to me - in the credits .Who wrote it ? Was it from the original score ?Is there anyone here who's seen both the 3-D and flat version in theaters ?I saw the flat one .Funny , this being out at about the same time as Frankenweenie and that Sandler Transylvania one - Hollywood - thy name art originality !Thy name be originality !Thy name is originality:-)..........."
181,ParaNorman,7,1 September 2012,ParaNorman Activity,"This film is recommended.Witches and zombies and ghosts, oh my! The animators from Laika Studios, the makers of the highly imaginative but equally macabre Coraline, are at it again. Their lead character, Norman sees and talks to dead people! And he seems to have more interesting conversations with them than their live counterparts in the new 3-D stop-motion animation film, ParaNorman.While ParaNorman may not be as successful as their previous film effort, this animated feature brings with it enough artistry and clever moments to make it worth viewing, regardless of its misleading rating. (The film deserves a PG-13 for its many intense and scary scenes. ) The film succeeds in spoofing the horror genre with some wit and enough style to match.Like so many of today's film characters, Norman is a social outcast, that typical loner type. Seen as a freak by schoolmates, bullies, and his own family, it's up to Little Norman Babcock to save the town of Blithe Hollow from a witch's curse and, in turn, seize the day.The film has a wonderful look in its details with its stunning set design. The impressive use of textures and subtle touches about Norman's preoccupation with scary movies shows in his horror posters and other eerie paraphernalia found throughout in his bedroom. This, and many other scenes, makes one almost forget the painstaking and time-consuming process that is stop-motion animation. It all looks so natural up there, re-enforcing Norman's universe on the wide screen. Yet, the many skilled hours creating this vision is truly remarkable, even though some of the film's character development is lacking.Many of the character designs come off as more grotesque than the ghouls themselves. It is especially jarring with Norman's over-exaggerated family members, some of the redneck townspeople, and other supporting characters appearing more as stilted caricatures than real-life characters. That director choice never allows the moviegoer to relate to the drama at hand and downplays the actual creatures that invade Norman's world.There is some rather funny references to other horror staples like Halloween, Friday the 13th, even Young Frankenstein. But that insider hipness is lost on the younger audience members and maybe even some older ones. The voice-over are well done, particularly Kodi Smit- McPhee as Norman and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Alvin the Bully.Written by Chris Butler, who also directed with Sam Fell, the film's script is better than average, even if the plot becomes predictable and a bit lame. It's all more of the same overworked theme we've seen before in animated features. The film's flies its freak flag high with its individuality-triumphs message. This everyones'-uniqueness-makes-us-stronger message has gotten stale of late.Still, there are two memorable sequences that help to set ParaNorman apart from other animated films: a terrific scene in the boy's room where Norman is haunted by a spirit and runaway toilet paper and a scary chase in the woods where sharp tree branches jut out suddenly from everywhere to try to impale our hero ( Strong 3-D effects too ).A dear friend of mine always accuses me of having a special bias for animated films over live action features. And, I have to admit, he may be right, as I am in total awe of the imaginary world that these talented artisans create versus the real world trappings of other films. Perhaps it brings out the inner child within me. That's what ParaNorman did to me! Witches and zombies and curses, oh yeah! Bring 'em on! GRADE: BNOTE: Stay until the end of the final credits, which are among the year's best. There a quick high speed version that parlays Norman from the printed 2-D storyboard stage right up to his 3-D personification.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
