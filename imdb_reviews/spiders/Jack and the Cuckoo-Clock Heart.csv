0,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,7,9 July 2014,Just... a gem.,"I generally like animation movies, ever since Shrek I guess. This one is quite amazing. It's not your typical Disney, or Pixar production. It's French, Belgian production, and you can see cultural differences influencing it, especially music and songs. I just loved the first duet of the main characters. That tune is so catchy, melody will surely get stuck in your mind.How great is it, that we live in the world with so many different cultures. Unfortunately world is becoming more and more bland, end everything you see seems to be the same....but occasionally, you find a gem like that.It's different so it may not be to everyones liking. OK so that's the good, the bad is, story kind of drags on at few moments. Anyways it's worth checking out, even if just because of the style.It's rather aimed at adults as a sort of animated art form musical, but kids should enjoy it too."
1,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,9,4 February 2015,An Animated young Love story for VERY Mature Teens & Up,"As many other reviewers are noting...This feature is NOT for Kids. Not because of inappropriate trashy stuff: There's no cursing, no nudity, no anime-kiddie-porn, and none of the usual over the top violence we've become used to in general Kid animated features (Explosions, etc) Rather, it's the unpleasant emotional issues of acceptance & affection and Life & Death that are front and center. That said, the story of a baby born with a frozen heart that's replaced with a cuckoo clock is richly detailed, with some very well written songs and a story line that moves with a brisk pace. The animation of the fantasy Clockwork-Victorian world is visually exquisite.But be warned: This is no Disney scripted place where everyone has a happy ending. There are dark moments that will lead to a poetic and poignant place.Even if you don't have kids (Teen or otherwise) to consider...this movie is a beautifully crafted piece of light drama for Adults to enjoy on a nice rainy or snowy Sunday Afternoon."
2,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,10,10 February 2014,Grandiose,"This film is full of poetry, of sincerity, of lightness embellished by intense emotions and sensations. The world of Dionysos is incredible. This is an animated film, but so much done for adults to me. / Spoiler / The fact is that I was truly surprised by the young age of these lovers! So much maturity in such young minds. By thinking more deeply, it is true that with everything that has happened to him, he could be full of maturity, but he never leaves home before so long, he does not have many life experience. .. It is perhaps precisely what makes it great and innocent maturity. All told, this age might be well suited. / End spoiler;) / A wonderful not to be missed movie!"
3,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,,2 September 2017,admirable   work,"it is one of films who you expect. for long, long time. because, in a beautiful, touching, unique form , it is a film about yourself. and this is the most important thing. it is a trip in the heart of childhood, the old fashion childhood. and this transforms it in a gem. the source of its special spell/magic - the great work of Mathias Malzieu. . his novel. his adaptation. and, his Jack. it is difficult to define it. it is not perfect and this is one of basic good things. it is not Pixar or Disney and this is the second virtue. it is a meet with well known characters from old, oldies stories . and it is enough. because, in fact, it is a an admirable game of imagination."
4,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,10,2 June 2017,lol,"//SPOILERS//Starting off I thought maybe I'd enjoy it. Seeing the prego lady I was instantly concerned. Her baby came out as a fully grown toddler, someone send her prayers???? THEN she goes ""YEET"" and leaves her baby with some old lady who needs a hairstylist, and collects tears on the DL. She also takes out his heart and replaces it with a clock but idk if that is important. Then this kid goes out and falls in love with this Spanish chick cause they sang together for .000005 seconds (send her prayers too cause like random thorns kinda pop up all over her ????). THEN Edward Cullen shows up and he spittin fire like DRAKE. AND THEN Jack the FREAKING RIPPER shows up on a train. I was like HOLD UP, can we just PAUSE for a second. THIS KID j CHILLING on that train, and JACK the RIPPER starts singin him a song. I think this kiddo was a little suicidal cause he killed himself???? idk. He climbed snowflakes.////SPOILER OVER////If you wanna see a movie that gives you whiplash worse than a whip givin you a lash, then be my guest."
5,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,10,2 June 2017,?????,"OKAY SO ///spoilers/// from the get-go this movie showed glaring red flags. from the witch lady who replaces his heart with a clock??? does he have a circulatory system?? what is happening? and then after a huge amount of other concerning things, such as a British Edward Cullen (???)basically bullies jack and in the process his eye is stabbed by the cuckoo, jack the ripper pops up, its casual. he's singing about slaughtering people, as jack the ripper does, you do you, bro. there is some weird stuff with a french dude who falls in love with a two headed lady at a literal freak show. and then when you think ""this couldn't get worse, right?"" he turns suicidal and decides to throw away his life and climb the snowflakes, ""wow."" ///spoiler over/// if you are on the hunt for an unintentional Rom-com that will make you laugh harder than twilight purely because of it's awkward and unexplained possibly nonexistent plot (thorns????????), then this is the movie for you, Fam."
6,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,9,28 February 2015,Moulin Rouge + Hugo + Frozen= This amazing film,"While the dialogue is a little muddled due to its French and English combination, that seems to be the only flaw of ""Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart."" The animation is simply incredible. As George Melies, a character in the story, would put it: ""A labor of love down to the last detail!"" The characters themselves look like porcelain dolls, and the story is so captivating with its stunning visual effects and dream-like sequences. You are immediately drawn in by the active imagination of the hopeless romantic protagonist, and the struggle he faces while living with a mechanical heart. This film touches upon the same kind of romance as ""Moulin Rouge,"" the stunning aesthetic of ""Hugo,"" and the complexity of ice and love in ""Frozen."" At first glance it may look silly, but after giving it a chance, I was not disappointed. If you love musicals, animation, and a story that is heartwarming as well as heart wrenching, then you will absolutely love ""Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart."""
7,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,5,2 July 2014,Animation within an animation,"The porcelain characters were convincing; so much so they were able to bring the more cartoon- like Tinkerbell type character in over the top. I thought wait a minute that is animation within an animation. There were a lot of good elements. I liked the carnival scenes. It needed more suspense though. It dragged slightly towards the end I felt. It seemed too young for adults to watch and too old for children; and probably a tad insipid for teenagers.I wasn't sure whom it was aimed at. Some kids would lose interest and some adults would too for different reasons. It was a sincere movie and the animation was different and interesting. But somehow the story was a bit unconvincing even if you suspended your disbelief to enjoy the movie. I mean I bought into the movie to enjoy it but it did not grab me enough with any compelling elements or drag me along enough. It had a lot of good original components and ideas. but it needed more suspense and it did not create enough concern for the characters. But to be fair I kept thinking,""get that key back'. It seemed to sacrifice the overall plot in preference to style. Indeed it was very stylish animation. I don't think it will be a cult film in America because the English accents might be a bit foreign sounding for United States audiences to engage with. Its good but something indefinable seemed to be lacking. Yet it could have just been my own obtuseness. There were many things I liked about it but the story itself did not really take hold of me."
8,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,10,15 November 2014,Amazing!,"I loved this movie so much! The music is beautiful, and there is such a wide variety of music genres/styles as well. I definitely recommend it, and it is for sure my favorite movie! However, my two younger sisters who are 5 years and 4 years of age were not able to sit through it, though that might just be them. It is not like a Disney princess movie or anything on NickJr. The movie is very surrealistic, so if you don't like that type of thing then I do not recommend this to you. If you are thinking about watching it, maybe look up a few of the songs and watch those before deciding if you would like to watch the movie or not. I really do think it was brilliant!"
9,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,3,11 September 2014,"Bad when they sing, average when they don't","Out of curiosity, I watched both the French and the English-dubbed versions. The latter is slightly worse than the former, which isn't very good to begin with, except for some bits.It's an animated musical, written and directed by Mathias Malzieu. The score is a rock album released in 2007 by the band Dionysos, in which Mr Malzieu sings. The album itself is adapted from a novel written by... Mathias Malzieu. Who also leads the cast of the movie. And like most multi-tasked artists, he isn't very good. I can't talk about the novel, but the movie's writing is poor. At least, the man sings in tune.The worst of it all is definitely the score. The music is rather unpleasant and often out of place, but the French lyrics are so bad that they make the average lines of Grand Corps Malade sound good by comparison (the man wrote his own pieces.) When the French sing in English, it's even more ridiculous. The lyrics of the English version are also poor, but not because they lost something in translation.The French cast is very uneven. The many artists invited to perform on the album also play their parts in the movie. Sure, they can sing, but some of them have no clue about acting. When seasoned veteran Jean Rochefort shows up as Melies, it's like a breath of fresh air. He steals the show and makes the film suddenly watchable. Unfortunately, the English version loses him, and all his charm; it also loses a few good voices for more neutral ones.The animation is subpar for a French product, but not always. It plays with different styles along the story, sometimes with great effect.Too bad it's a musical. It could have been good otherwise, losing the annoying songs and replacing some of the cast with proper actors in the process. That and some work on the script."
10,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,8,4 September 2014,"Love is dangerous, even in your dreams, so dream softly","This whimsical animated french film about love is a delightful treat.Jack is a boy who with a heart condition and mustn't feel any emotion in excess, you see he has a cuckoo clock for a heart. Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart is a fanciful tale from creator Mathias Malzieu.Malzieu's Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart is a hopeless love story of a morose young fellow cursed with a faulty cuckoo heart. Not only that, this melancholic boy turned tormented teen falls in love for a girl with rose tendrils as hair who is visually impaired from crying tears of ice. The romance is doomed as his adopted mother Madeline informs him a single kiss could stop his ticking heart.The poetic narrative twists and turns and Jack's troubles are Shakespearean, full of misguided choices and fallacious offenses. Some would say the adventitious plot is careless and designless but I think that is where the artistry lies.The animation is dark and Gothic, decidedly Burtonesque with a Henry Selick or Laika quality yet simultaneously original. While CGI, the animation has a unique marionette picturebook characteristic. The characters are fresh and inexplicably bewitchingly fantastic  from a a bespectacled feline with metallic whiskers, a man with a xylophonic spine, to an angelic woman (women?) with wings and two heads. We don't actually know why this 19th century setting is so magical but it is imaginative enough to not care, especially when Jack lands at the carnival.Unable to find the original French language version with English subtitles I was consigned to viewing the English dubbed version. While adequate I do wish I could have listened to the songs as they were written and the initially cast French actors. The music is lovely and moving and the English lyrics keep up.More reviews of recent releases can be found at our website."
11,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,5,22 March 2014,"Fantastic and creative animation, infantile and undeveloped plot","The animation, the attention to detail, the dream sequences... What a treat! The squeaky, porcelain flesh animation of the human characters is not ideal, but the rest of the film is full of exquisite detail and various styles of animation that really make this a visual treat.However, the plot leaves much to be desired. Perhaps some dialog and song lyrics fall short in translation. But this is not really the main issue. The real problem here is the lack of a proper story arc and character development. Except for Jack, and maybe his adoptive mother, characters are completely flat. They have no dimension, no motive, no real driving force. Sure, there is plenty of brooding mood and dark clouds and Gothic humor (of sorts), but these cannot substitute for story elements and development. At any given point in the ""story,"" one is never sure why any character does what they do, really. Why is the bad guy, Joe, so against Jack to begin with? Sure, OK, he is a bully. And Jack hurts him. And he seeks revenge? How? A duel of wits? What? And why does the love interest leave with Joe? I know, she is upset that Jack didn't tell her that his heart will give out if he falls in love, oh, but wait, he did, and well, she kind of knew that, so what is exactly is the problem? And even if she is upset at Jack, there is NO reason she would leave, like leave leave with Joe... No reason. She seems completely indifferent to Joe. In the end, the only truly impressive parts of the film are the dream sequences, where there is no real plot anyway. These excel and give a glimpse of the true potential of the film, and perhaps the vision of the creator.On top of the lack of story arc that makes any sense and the lack of character development, the characters break into song rather randomly. Here, the awkward lyric translations really made us raise eye brows and look at each other quizzically. In the end, we liked the dream sequences and the misfit family (+ the cat!) from Jack's childhood. I still would recommend the film for animation fans just for the visuals and the whimsical circus stuff, but do not expect anything deeper than a 12-year-old boy's fantasy of a love affair.ps. Is she really supposed to be a flamenco dancer? Uhm, maybe check out some real flamenco, or not call her that. One or the other, because really, otherwise, it is an insult to flamenco and flamenco dancers to call her a flamenco dancer."
12,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,5,12 July 2014,Very unique...but not an especially enjoyable story,"Originally, ""Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart"" was a French-language film. However, a recent English dub has been completed and so the film is available to a much wider audience. The problem is that STILL the film is only for select people--as I doubt if most younger children would enjoy it. And, the same might be said for their parents as well.This movie is set in some sort of odd world that looks a bit 19th century, a bit goth-like and a bit weird. The world truly is unique and the story has an other-worldliness that sets it apart from so many other CGI films. So, even though some real world folks appear in it, such as Jack the Ripper and Georges Méliès*, it is definitely NOT our world!It all begins on the coldest day ever on the face of the Earth. A pregnant woman stumbles into the home of a midwife and gives birth. But, because it was so cold, the child's heart is frozen and, in a weird bit of surgery, the midwife shoves a cuckoo clock into the baby's chest. That night, the mother leaves--abandoning the boy to be raised by the midwife. Suddenly, the film skips ahead 10 years. The boy is lonely as his foster mother has sheltered him from the world--perhaps out of some misguided desire to shelter him because of his heart. This is because he has three rules he MUST obey: he cannot touch the hands of the clock, he must hold his temper AND he must never fall in love--as his heart cannot stand it. Of course, once the boy is allowed out of the house, this is exactly what happens--leading to the boy going on a cross- country adventure to pursue his love. This is a bit odd, as the kid is only 10...but whatever.This adventure leads him to Mr. Méliès as well as to a super-strange assortment of sideshow freaks which are MUCH freakier than any you've seen. There, with the show, is the girl he fell for--though considering she really never noticed him, it's not surprising that she doesn't recognize him. What's next? Well, you can see that for yourself.As I mentioned above, this film probably has a very small audience. The characters and story would go over the head of younger kids, as would the songs. I tried showing this to some adults, but they lost interest as well. So who is left? Perhaps goth kids will like it. Perhaps older kids and teens. But, if you are looking for some cute family film with lots of cute songs and characters, keep looking. While I think ""Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart"" is a wonderful film when it comes to its world-building, unusual characters and very unusual CGI, I am stumped and have no idea if others will like it or not. As for me, it was mildly interesting but I lost interest after a while. Perhaps it might have been better as a short film.*The French film pioneer, Georges Méliès, was also recently in the film ""Hugo""."
13,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,10,27 October 2014,A  Wonderful Film. One Of The Top Five Animated Features Of The Decade.,"I didn't think I could love French cinema any more than I do. I've watched some of the best of live-action French cinema, but I've never seen an animated French feature (produced by Luc Besson produced, no less). Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart kindled an interest in me to watch more French cinema. The beautiful thing about this movie, other than the way it looks, is its style. It is based on a rock concept album by the rock band Dionysus, so it is a musical - a feature animated musical. Simply put, Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart is the best animated feature since Toy Story 3 (not counting The Wind Rises for the sake of our mostly American readers) and it is the best musical since Sweeney Todd and Hairspray.The movie has a very unique animated look. It is not quite as clay animated as Mary and Max but not as ""normal looking,"" per se, as Finding Nemo. It comes off as a cross between the two. I'll admit, I am no expert in the creation of animated films but I do know what works in a film. Another aspect of the film's look, its art direction, is quite beautiful. It is dark, mysterious and effective in its tone. Speaking of which - the tone is quite dark with an underlying feeling of loss and rejection. Even the score, in its happiest moments, have a heavy feeling under the surface. Although love does find its way into the story and the objectives of the characters, loss and judgment resurface. The themes are quite adult and not appropriate for young children.As to the finest aspect of the movie - the score and songs, I would love this to be turned into a Broadway musical. The style of the musical and the editing combined is reminiscent of Moulin Rouge, filled with vivacity and rapid pacing. The songs each carry their own beat and enhance the personalities of each character and its intentions. There is a mixture of ballads, rap, rock and even Latin. I would buy the soundtrack to this movie.The story itself is about a boy born with a heart so weak that falling in love would be too much for him. The movie follows his early life where he inevitably falls in love (screenwriting 101) and the strength of his heart is put to the test.I have learned over the years that just because a film is animated, it's not necessarily designed for children. Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart isn't exactly The Grave of the Fireflies but it is not for young children either. I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18. And my rating is 5 out of 5 stars. It is a wonderful film. It is one of the top five animated features of this decade. Reviewed by Willie J."
14,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,7,7 September 2014,"In this odd little animated love story, you watch one young boy's journey from Edinburgh to France all for perhaps one kiss.","It is rare to find English language animated films not done by Disney or Dreamworks, or have their label on it for American distribution, so imagine finding a film which looks like a low budget Tim Burton film. One which, like most Disney movies, is a musical of sorts and has its own prominent director with Luc Besson (director of Lucy & The Family). But the question is: with this film barely having much buzz or news around it, does that mean it is bad or that simply it just doesn't have a good marketing push?Characters & StoryPoor little Jack (Mathias Malzieu) was abandoned by his mother on the day he was born and left with the rumored town witch Madeline (Marie Vincent/ Emily Loizeau). A woman incapable of having children of her own, but was given little Jack to be her son. Issue is, Jack was born on the coldest day ever known and the cold froze his little heart. So, being that Madeline is quite skilled in replacing body parts with things around the house, she decides to replace Jack's heart with a cuckoo clock.Something which leads to quite a bit of difficulty for Jack. If just because of the rules involved with having a cuckoo clock heart: 1. He can never touch the clock's hands; 2. He must always watch his temper; and most of all, 3. He cannot fall in love. All of these issues Madeline kept Jack safe from for as long as she could, but on his 11th birthday she takes him into town, perhaps for the first time ever in his life, and naturally he falls in love at first sight.Leading to the heart of our story which deals with Jack trying to live a normal life. One in which he deals with the issues that come with loving a woman like Miss Acacia (Olivia Ruiz). Issues which are distance, since she moves away; dealing with his own jealousy and Joe's (Grand Corps Malade), who looks like a bootleg Robert Pattinson; and a slew of other emotions which put a heavy load on Jack's cuckoo clock heart. Leaving you to wonder, in the pursuit of love will Jack find bliss, misery, or perhaps the end of his mortality?PraiseIf you look at the basic premise of the story, a boy with a weak heart falling in love, you have a wonderful tale. One which has lots of cute moments between Jack and Miss Acacia, with a handful of songs, in the beginning, which really highlight their tale of love at first sight well. Then, on top of that, you have a slew of interesting characters like Madeline, and those who she has fixed with wooden legs, or a xylophone spine, which presents a whole other story you wish was explored. Yet, even without the information you seek, just the oddness of every character, and the animation which isn't the most complex, and yet still is quite beautiful, the film is a treat for the eyes.CriticismBut what makes this movie a bit difficult to like, without pause, is the music and the dialog. Starting with the music, the band Dionysos recorded all the music for the movie and, to me, it has a David Bowie type vibe, and not in a good way. Think some of his music in Labyrinth to get the general feel of the music in the film. Which isn't to say all the songs are bad, some in the beginning I liked, and Miss Acacia's Spanish numbers were good, but for the most parts the songs I wanted to mute for lyric wise they weren't interesting, and the voices in front of the music didn't help much either.Moving to the topic of dialog, what I want to convey is while the story is good, i.e. what happens throughout the movie, the dialog really isn't. For, in my opinion, like the music, the more you watch the movie the more flaws and things to dislike you'll find. Like when the story is set in Edinburgh things are for the most part are good, but with the travel to France, and the introduction of Melies (Jean Rochefort), the only saving grace is Miss Acacia. For with Melies, him talking about love, among other topics, and then, anything not featuring solely Miss Acacia and Jack, just seems like people are talking for the sake of taking up time and not making any sense, or really adding to the story much.Leading to my last issue: Joe. To me, Joe's presence in the film is overkill and so unnecessary. In my opinion, it would have perhaps been better to cut Joe and just make Jack ostracized without Joe being the central bully. Much less have him come around at the most opportune time to reveal the rules of Jack's heart to Acacia. After all, between Madeline's patients, Melies, or Jack himself, there were many better ways to reveal the rules without the happenstance of Joe showing up on the most important day of Jack and Miss Acacia's burgeoning relationship.Overall: TV ViewingI am on the border of saying to skip this due to the music, Joe's character, and the dialog; however, I really do like the romantic story of Miss Acacia and Jack, as well as Jack's relationship with Madeline, to the point I, with some hesitation, am going to label this TV Viewing. For while Jack's relationships aren't written to be so grand they will leave a precedent in your mind, his relationship with Miss Acacia is cute enough to deal with all the nonsense surrounding it."
15,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,4,11 February 2015,Incoherent and unemotional,"The idea overall is very promising: a boy with a clock as the heart must find a way to control his feelings for a girl or his heart might stop. However, the execution is embarrassingly bad.After the first 10 minutes, which were decent, the movie starts rushing and skipping over details for no reason. First, the boy meets the girl of his dream, with whom he falls in love within seconds. Then the girl disappears, so he decides to attend her school, in which he meets a bunch of bullies, and BAM, years are skipped and he turns into a teenager. By this point, the girl and the boy still haven't had any significant on screen interactions except that one initial meeting, yet she still gives him a gift box for some reason, and somehow that gift turns up in the hands of his bully, and fighting ensues. Just like that, the movie keeps going in a very confusing and messy fashion. Many characters appear without warning only to disappear within minutes, and their emotions and motivations are rarely explored. Moreover, the relationship between the two main characters is so unconvincing that even Disney's films from 1960s can do better.Nevertheless, the animation is pretty good. Some parts actually look great, both in technology and style, especially the musical sequences. Still, I really don't like the character style used here as it makes the characters quite creepy and emotionless.I also find the music pretty boring, but that might be a consequence of the English dubbing, which is terrible by the way.In conclusion, if you're a die-hard animation fan, you might want to check 'Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart' for the visuals. Other than that, I'm afraid this movie has nothing else to offer."
16,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,10,24 October 2014,"Okay! My first review, :-)","I am never a fan of musicals, even in some children's movies, but this movie, I really do love it. I do not enjoy all of the music but it is weird. I like weird lol; the love in this movie is so pure, gentle, and sweet. I adore Jack and Miss Acacia; the first time they met is very cute, adorable, and odd.Jack heart is very fragile and this love story is a metaphor of love in our own lives today. Our hearts are very fragile and I do not think it is impossible to NOT fall in love. It is medically proved that anger can cause damage to our hearts. WebMD have an article about how anger hurts our hearts.The way our hearts react when we fall in love, the way our heart hurts when we are dealing with some form of negativity in our relationships with the ones we love, like for example your love one is sick or may hurt you emotionally, etc. In this love story, they dealt with some pain, but at the end their love for each other remain true. It must of been heaven to him, lol, because the ending was somewhat obvious but mysterious as well.I really enjoyed Jack and Acacia duets and even though Joe was a total butthole; I did like his flow too. This love story is definitely an original. Too bad my son doesn't care for it but when I play Jack and Acacia's first duet; he'll fall asleep.Too bad Jack had to deal with bullying but that is life sometimes. Some kids are mistreated for being exceptional. I recommend this movie to anyone who like a little oddity. Cheers!"
17,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,9,22 October 2014,Now we are getting genre in animation,"What so say. The movie is so splendid. No wonder it made 2 nominations ! First of all, the animation itself. Much like corpse bride, it has some kind of eccentric artwork. Everything looks not normal, but somehow it fits ! Animation is not the best of the world, yet you feel there are some class into it. Characters models feel like they came from year old scrapbook of an artist, as if he didn't put a lot of polish. Yet he had a lot of fun while drawing it. Music was , as always, superb. I always ended up hearing too many times that i now need break to hear them again haha. Same thing happened again in another french movie: A monster in Paris. But that's another masterpiece of lighting effect and music. Overall story ? Well, story is not genuine and not unpredictable, although the ending is not as you'd expect from a animation movie, where happily ever after is common. While the story is not so great, it's the little things that makes most of the time grate to watch. It's 19th century, the age of mechanical craftsmanship. Transistors, chips, electricity was sci-fi. It's good to see how the mechanical dreams were represented in the movie. Surgically fit a clock into a human body ? Awesome ! I always loved mechanical machines, the cogs, the wheels. I really liked how they put this things with a complex matter like love. The movie also made some great Easter eggs for people who really care. Like the movie ""Hugo"", it showed some early tries of movie making by the magician. Like the spaceship hits the moon, in the eye. It's the classical plot in Hugo and again i saw it in here. I'm not a movie historian, but surely there are some important hints this movies are giving us. I'd love to understand all that ! This movie is too boring for children, and kickass generation of this days, and probably meh for adults who watch movie only for their children. It also doesn't have the polish that pixar movies has. But surely this is another little private achievement for me. I'm a animation nerd, and i'm feeling deeper emotions with this kind of movies. Better movies out there ? Yes ! There are. But to me, a single moment in a movie can win my heart, as let it go from frozen, la seine from A monster in Paris, now Flames with glasses in this movie. Keep em coming ! I said genre is coming to animation. Why ? This movie doesn't fit into normal animation movies. Like you can't say anime is cartoon. It's too much generalization. This movie is too eccentric. Surely there are wise people out there sorting this movies into categories. I feel this movie deserves it !"
18,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,6,5 November 2014,"Bizarre and poetic, with a creaky story salvaged by inventive ideas and stunning designs.","What do you get when you animate a French art-house film and flood it with an oddball mix of music that flits from rock opera to folk-pop and back again? Something a lot like Jack And The Cuckoo-Clock Heart. At its best, the film is a sumptuously animated treat teeming with ideas and metaphors. But it also bears a few telltale, creaky signs of being a passion project for co-director Mathias Malzieu  lead singer of the French rock band Dionysos, who came up with both the concept and the soundtrack.Jack (voiced by Malzieu) is born on the coldest day in recorded history  a day so cold that his heart literally freezes and stops beating. His mother takes him to Madame Madeleine (Marie Vincent/Emily Loizeau), the village 'witch' who replaces Jack's ticker with an actual cuckoo clock. The operation gives Jack life, but will cost him love. As Madeleine warns him in dire tones, falling in love will overheat his mechanical heart and thus must be avoided at all costs. Of course, Jack promptly meets the shortsighted and utterly enchanting Miss Acacia (Olivia Ruiz), a girl he decides to follow across Europe when he's accidentally exiled from his hometown.Frankly speaking, the script of Jack And The Cuckoo-Clock Heart is a bit of a mess. A tangle of steampunk and Gothic romance, it never really settles down into a coherent tale. Instead, its characters literally waltz through the film, singing deeply poetic rock songs in varyingly awkward blends of English and French, but only rarely forging believable connections with one another or the audience. That's probably because the film was assembled around a Dionysos concept album of cabaret songs that was later adapted into a novella. As a result, both story and characters somehow pull off the strange trick of being both simple and forced.And yet, for all the stutterings of its narrative engine, Jack And The Cuckoo-Clock Heart is an oddly charming experience. This is due in no small part to its incredibly inventive character design and fantastic visuals. Madeleine sprouts tendrils when she must venture out of her comfort zone and into town, while the wooden cuckoo nestled in Jack's heart literally springs to chirping life every hour. Miss Acacia's travelling-circus home teems with wonderfully weird characters  a tiny world upon itself, populated by freaks who swirl around her as she dances to a flamenco beat.Indeed, if you give yourself over to Jack And The Cuckoo-Clock Heart, the strange poetry out of which it's been meticulously constructed will start to work its magic. There's considerably more joy to be had in just enjoying the film for what it is, rather than puzzling over its slight and confused story. On this count, you'll be rewarded with the kind of imaginative mayhem that can only unfold in an animated film. Buoyed by the power of love, Miss Acacia literally floats on clouds and dances in the sky. The film doesn't so much reference the work of iconic surrealist filmmaker Georges Méliès as co-opt it  he's a full-fledged character in the film (voiced by Jean Rochefort), an inventor who tinkers with Jack's heart and finds inspiration for his fantastical films in the peculiar universe of Miss Acacia's circus.Most of us have grown up on a steady diet of Disney and Pixar films which, while oftentimes brilliant, are characterised by linear storytelling which young children can grasp with ease. Jack And The Cuckoo-Clock Heart refuses to be bound by such strictures, instead dallying in the realm of bittersweet poetry. Its ending perversely manages to be happy and sad all at once, which fits very well with the off-kilter oddness that characterises the entire film. That can make for a deeply frustrating experience, but also a curiously rewarding one."
19,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,6,1 April 2015,"Superb Visuals, Plot Faltered","The visual animation of this movie is notches above the average Pixar and Disney fare, especially in its attention to details and inventiveness, framed from interesting perspectives with captivating clarity.It started of with enough heart ('cuckoo' no-doubt) and sufficient bizarre to draw you in. Unfortunately, about a quarter of the way through the plot starts to falter with too many unnecessary songs that doesn't add to the story but only detracts from it - songs that are averagely catchy but tend to be repetitive and too pop-oriented to capture the essence of the movie. The reason for all the intrusive songs is as follows from Wikipedia: ""Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart is based on the concept album by the French rock band Dionysos, and on the illustrated novel La Mécanique du cur written by the band's lead singer Mathias Malzieu. The music of the film was entirely composed by Dionysos""May have worked as an audio album, but for this movie, Luc Besson (one of two producers) should have instructed that the visuals and the story alone be allowed to do the ""singing"", backed by good inspiring theme music.The English dubbing (from the original French) is definitely one of the better done ones - I suspect many (but not all) of the original French actors, also did the voice-over in English, including most (but not all) the songs.Overall, would still strongly recommend this animation, if but for the visual feast alone!"
20,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,5,28 April 2017,Generic and not overly memorable...,"I sat down with my 7-year old son to watch ""Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart"", without really knowing what the story was about.It turned out that the story told in ""Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart"" was just mediocre, and I found both myself and my son with our focus on the screen lacking at times. The story wasn't really all that interesting or captivating. So ""Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart"" turned out to have no particular appeal to kids or adults.The art style used in this animated movie was quite interesting though, as it bore some resemblance to the odd style of Tim Burton. And it was that slightly odd and off-beat style that kept me hooked in. There was a lot of nice details in the art throughout the course of ""Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart"".As for the characters in the animated movie, well there was a very rich and colorful character gallery here. Lots of interesting characters with lots of quirks and unique details. I was particularly fond of the cat with the glasses.The voice acting in ""Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart"" turned out to be quite good, although I can't claim to be familiar with any of the voices on display here.All in all, ""Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart"" doesn't really stand out in the animation genre. And as it was hardly a very memorable movie, then it came and went without leaving any lasting impression - at least in my opinion.And without having read the book, then I don't know how well this 2013 animated version captured the essence of the story presented in the book, for better or worse."
21,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,8,11 February 2017,Fabulous movie,"We think this movie is fabulous. Both my kids love it and have watched it several times. They are 7, boy and girl. They enjoy the music and artistry. some of the topics are fairly serious but I find most kids see movies for what they are, Fun entertainment. They aren't looking for deeper meaning or emotional attachments. If they want to discuss the movie content, we do , but they mostly just enjoy the show. I suppose this movie isn't for all kids. My kids also enjoy Book of Life, which is also on the odd side. As for the ""jack the ripper"" part ,my kids have no idea who that is. It was just a scary looking character. They didn't pay that much attention to it."
22,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,10,1 June 2016,Beautiful,"I love this movie. The music. The way the story is told. The characters.A few nights ago my 5-year-old daughter and I sat down for movie night. We chose this. Of course she asked so many questions the whole way through, but she sat through the whole movie and talked about it for days. We sat down again and watched it the whole way through. She is a lover of music and of course wanted to hear the songs, sadly we could only find on YouTube in English. Anyway, the movie was simply beautiful. Tim Burton is one of my absolute favorite directors and this movie had a similar feel to it. I would definitely recommend this movie, and I have."
23,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,10,14 April 2016,Beautiful and heartbreaking,"I have read comments where people mention how much this movie reminded them of ''Hugo''. I too agree that there are several similarities and it was only natural that since i loved ''Hugo'', i would absolutely fall in love with ''Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart''. From the very first second the film introduces you to a surreal, almost fairytale- ish world that you cannot help but lose yourself into. The story is quite simple. It handles a universal and overused theme; love. The ache of love and the risks we take (or don't take) for the sake of it. But Jack is not only set to get hurt if he falls in love; he is doomed to die. So i think that makes his point of view on the matter quite original. What amazed me more about the film is that Jack's condition made it that much easier for the makers to portray the way he feels (when he hurts, when he is overwhelmed with love and joy) and for us to feel with him. It was a very unique experience. There is only one group of people that i would not recommend this film to. If you do not like musicals, you will not enjoy the film. Many times the actual dialogue gives its place to songs."
24,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,10,18 October 2014,Thank you,"Thank you Mathias and Olivia, in a world of Hollywood shooting and Pixar UltraHD some can find gems as this one was for me. The story was credible, absolute natural, for adults no doubt because kids will have trouble grasping the reality of emotions showed with such attention to graphical detail. The magic stay in music, at first 20 seconds i was close to shutdown my screen, but this one froze me fast, story go with music step by step, i will say the movie is truly build with images glued with music to stay together. This movie is different true, it show me there is life in movies industry, still. Again, yours truly, thank you again Olivia and Mathias !"
25,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,3,21 February 2015,Ending kill any chace of this being a good movie,"Jack is somewhat interesting. It has a cool train with accordions connecting the cars. It is the 2nd film I've seen ) that features Georges Méliès as a character. The other film is Hugo, a great superior film. Jack the Ripper also makes a guest cameo trying to kill the protagonist. Although somewhat entertaining the film has serious narrative and problematic content. If a movie is recommended and aimed for children it should be void of suggestive content. It has no place in a kids film. Also it is creepy and weird but not in the good way, in say a film like Labyrinth. Also the ending kills any chance of it being a good film.I hope I can convey this ending adequately so you don't need to sit through this picture. Or perhaps you will want to sit through it to witness it first hand. Jack has a Cuckoo-Clock heart. He goes on a series of adventures to find this girl and finds her, they sort of fall in love and he gives her the literal key to his heart. The key winds his heart so it keeps on ticking. She gets mad at him and his heart breaks. . He goes back home from the place where he was at to have his adoptive mother fix it for him. Only problem is his mum is dead. He goes out into the snow to die.His true love realizes her mistake and goes to find him. She finds him in the snow and offers to wind his heart for him with the key he gave her. He tosses the key into the snow instead and kisses her. The scene then freezes as if somebody stopped time. He begins to climb to the sky on the snowflakes hanging lifeless in the air.The End Really. That's where it ends."
26,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,5,25 January 2015,Definitely not for kids...,"I started to watch this movie with my children, fourteen and six years old. My daughter (the one on her fourteen) was also commenting that her young brother should not be watching the movie due to inappropriate scenes. The boy went playing with his games and stopped watching the movie. Therefore I will let adults judging how good the movie is for adults.I would like to suggest that this movie should not be watched by kids or young children, or at least watch it first by yourself and then make your own judgment. I would say kids under twelve years old should not watch it although it is rated 6 years old in some countries. The movie is quite dark, fed with cruel scenes and in my opinion is suggesting a fragmented self-image that is not rebuilt at the end. A child is not prepared and has not the capability of self-reconstruction when exposed to such movie."
27,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,5,22 October 2014,Foiled by the positive Reception....,"I was first introduced to this film when I saw it on the shelf of my local video store. I looked at it and thought to myself this could just be a animation reject or maybe there is more to it. I went home a researched it and saw it has a 70% on rotten tomatoes. So I found it again at my local red-box and gave it a try.Since I just saw it is fresh in my mind, and I gotta say it wasn't that enjoyable. The pacing was off, the animation was creative but looked cheap, and the movie just had weird and pointless moments.For example (without spoiling anything); Our main character is on a train and it should be quiet atmospheric moment but then out of no where some guy just shows up and tries to kill him. Who was that, what was he doing?Even the English dub was really off and the actors sounded very bored and monotone. But to the film's credit Although the animation did look cheap I really did like the design. I'd love to see Dreamworks or Pixar make a film in this style. Another thing that caught my interest is that the romance is actually genuine. The two leads actually have good chemistry and you want to route for theI am aware that is movie is based on a story that is supposed to be a part of a rock album and the band actually had involvement in making this movie. I think if this movie was given to professionals I'll bet the movie would have been a unique experience. But as is this film is pretty lack-luster, If you want to see it all power to but I say it ain't really worth the time."
28,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,1,9 January 2018,Can I give this less than one star?,"This movie actually made me angry. I found myself angry with it about halfway through. The main female character was annoying and useless and I found Jack bland as well. I know it isn't Tim Burton but his movies are charming as well as weird but this movie had none of the charm to balance out the weird and replaced charm with irritating. I didn't even like the animation, once again it lacked charm.
 
I didn't enjoy it, it made me irritated, I was yelling at the main girl, bored by the lead, I dislike this movie immensely. Nothing about this movie was endearing to me."
29,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,10,20 November 2017,Brilliant,"As others have noted the audience should be for an older audience. It is a unique piece that is highly underrated. The mixture of art, poetry, and music leaves you breathless. The ending leaves one speechless. This truly is a masterpiece.I'd be curious to see how this would perform in Japan as it seems more culturally up their alley in terms of how a mass audience would react to a work such as this."
30,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,1,12 November 2017,Not fit for anyone,"######Spoiler Alert for everyone, especially children.DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!The movie is a bit dark but the bully gets it. Sort of a good story about adoption. Boy falls in love after severe warnings not to do so.The ruining factor is that #####Spoiler alert######the star boy, after getting his true love, commits suicide. Yes, life is great so now I will kill myself. What kind of losers make a movie for anyone, especially teens, that glorifies suicide. That is violence and should make this rated R. There is NOTHING GOOD or entertaining about suicide. Ruined the whole movie and evening."
31,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,1,28 October 2017,"Boring, plus definitely NOT for kids!!","Maybe it loses something in translation into English, but I thought the movie was boring and the violence and singing about Jack the Ripper like it was okay was just SERIOUSLY damaged!! I came upon the movie by accident and thought it was going to be more like The Boxtrolls which wasn't a great movie but at least it was watchable, tho had I seen it previously, I would NOT have bought it for my children!! I'm VERY glad that I did not let them watch this one as Boxtrolls was already disturbing enough and it was NOTHING in comparison to this one!! Unfortunately the previews made the movies seem better than they actually are. No idea how this movie got such high stars overall. Avoid and save yourself from awful thoughts and songs and images getting stuck in your head!!"
32,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,2,3 April 2015,Overrated,"I found myself skipping through the film as I do not like the Laika- like style and animation for the beginning. So, at some points it is sub-par but others, I just hate it. The story is also not quite as interesting, it's pretty sentimental as it's about a boy with a cuckoo- clock on his heart that tells him the three rules: ""Not to fall in love, not to get angry, and not to touch the hands of the clock"" or he will die. Madeleine protects him from it.He then meets a little girl while wandering off that is the same age as him, singing while winding up a music box. He then starts to fall in love with her. While, I admit, this does has cute romance, I didn't care for the Boxtrolls style and animation for it."
33,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,,14 January 2015,"Awful, nonsensical, and cruel","It takes a lot for me to sign up to IMDb and review a movie, but I had bad feelings about this movie from the opening, then stopped watching at 30 minutes in and jumped to the end to see what happens.In summary the movie is about a boy who's mother leaves him, has his heart taken out, told never to fall in love, gets bullied terribly, when he stands up for himself his foster mother gets thrown into prison and dies while he is on the run, and his girlfriend neither loves him or trusts him also leaving him to die. All wrapped in musical numbers where at age 11 he sees a girl for the first time and sings about tearing off her clothes with his teeth. The movie looks pretty. It sounds interesting. But I have fairly low standards and couldn't watch through this tripe. Neither for kids or adults I don't know who the audience is but they are not of this Earth."
34,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,2,21 February 2015,NOT for kids! seriously...,"So.. this is an interesting movie. I absolutely get that people find it exciting and different, but for me it lacks heart. If the storyline was better I think it could be great... It has progressive music and animation but that's about it...And it's not, it's really NOT for kids. I just want to say that I'm a young person who doesn't think that kids are too fragile too watch anything but Winnie the pooh, (that's not it). But this movie... It's very dark, it's extremely sexist, there's bullying (extreme), ..SPOILERyeah, and Jack the ripper is in it, singing of how he enjoys slicing up women, both redheads, blondes and brunettes, (all of em should taste some).SPOILER endsI don't know. I think it's just too much. Without any morals or warmth what so ever. So. It's a movie for grown ups. Don't watch it with your kids cause they won't get it at all, and probably end up having some terrible nightmares..."
35,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,8,31 December 2014,Visual delight,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart is more a treat for the eyes than a story for the brain. I will encourage anyone to watch this marvelous animated movie for the wonderful detail and action. But it is a bit thin on plot - there is even one part that makes the movie rather slow.From the start Jack is told to not fall in love because it will be his demise. So from there you know what's going to happen or at least you suspect it will happen. But from childhood to adulthood Jack experiences everything and more life (in animation world) has to serve up in his pursuit of the girl he loves.As I stated it's worth a watch because the graphics are just wild and the carnival setting is to love!
36,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,3,30 August 2015,It's not the best movie I've seen...,"OK so I decided to pick this movie for the night since I didn't know what to watch in putlocker. Anyways I started playing it and at the beginning, I thought the mother was going to die as it was a pretty cold spot where the midwife lived but it seems she left Jack with her. What a way to start a film eh? So we move on and on, Jack has escaped from the police and is on a train. Then all of a sudden, Jack the ripper comes out of nowhere with a knife and try to kill Jack. Seriously, why the hell did they decide to add him onto this? He pretty much is a pointless character since you really don't see him throughout the movie! For the love of god like! I have to say the music really didn't give me a good vibe or feeling, it sounded like the music was from a pub or from out on the street. I felt it the whole soundtrack should've been done more better. It really sounded rubbish like!I wouldn't call this the best dark movie ever and definitely kids would be bored or even scared of this!"
37,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,7,14 January 2015,Artistic Gem,"This animation is definitely unique and different from any other animation I've seen! It is an artistic masterpiece, has a very clever story, unique music that I totally did not expect, and of course just absolutely wonderful animation! I do highly recommend this movie for the age group of 13 on up. I don't believe younger children will understand the story line.I'm an artist and LOVE to see different types of animation as it helps me to sculpt and create differences.Jack and The Cuckoo Clock Heart isn't as ""dark"" as some of Tim Burton's works, but still has a little gloomy feel to it. At first I wasn't sure I liked it, but seeing it through ... I LOVE IT!"
38,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,7,21 December 2014,Don't take the kids!,"I kept thinking, I hope people have not taken children to this movie which is so bizarre and somewhat dark and could easily be disarming and cause nightmares in children. It seems similar to Tim Burton films, offbeat, weird and dark. On one hand it, you can say it was quite creative, but in a twisted strange way. It was as if someone had written the script while drinking absinthe and watching it made you feel like you were joining them. The musical score seemed like one that would accompany a stage production, quite elaborate. A portion of the dialogue when the bully character was confronting the main character, the boy, was written in poetry form and reminded me of Poe. After watching it awhile, I began to feel like it was too long, tedious and was hoping it would hurry and end soon. The end was clever, fitting and a bit touching. High marks for creativity, but too dark for children and just one of the strangest films I've ever seen."
