0,Bolt,10,15 November 2008,A VERY fun movie for old and young alike,"Its an animated movie about a dog. GIVEN, its a 'kids' movie. Unlike many animated movies, the dialog isn't full of innuendos or 'hidden' humor that only adults would 'get'. Its easily understood by kids, the animation is top-rate (as would be expected) and the characters are engaging and easy to enjoy. I admit that even though I love animation, I went to this sneak preview with a few misgivings. The trailers didn't look all that exciting, and I didn't expect to see anything I hadn't already seen. On one hand, I was right. The animation WAS very good, but nothing that hadn't been done before. But on the other hand I was pleasantly wrong. The formula works perfectly for Bolt. It was fun, didn't have any 'dull' spots, and while my theater was filled with a fairly consistent mix of children and young teens, and a relative smattering of adults, everyone seemed to enjoy it. Laughter was pretty consistent among the old and young, and at the end of the flick I heard something I rarely get to experience in theaters these days: applause. Granted, the adults were the ones applauding, and I joined in enthusiastically. The wife and I agree that this was one movie where we felt we got more than our dollars' worth. Thats a rare treat. Bolt did not disappoint on any level -and will find a spot in our library when the DVD eventually hits market. I fully expect this movie to do very well."
1,Bolt,9,9 November 2008,Bolt brings back true Disney,"I have been anticipating the release of Bolt for several months. I had an opportunity to see a screening of it and it exceeded all my expectations. Bolt is a wonderful movie with a good story and heart, something that Pixar has done well but Disney has struggled with. I believe the addition of John Lasseter to Disney Animation has made a significant impact on the quality and continuity of this film. Yes, it is CGI. You may ask, ""Why is Disney doing CGI when Pixar already does?"" All the studios are doing CGI right now. I have been very impressed with Pixar's CGI detail, however the detail in Bolt is even better. Creating a dog with fur that gets dirty, wet, wind-blown and looks real is very impressive (at least it is to me). In addition to better detail, the color and light of this film is so true to life, you'll think it's the real thing.I laughed, cried, and was on the edge of my seat. Disney has created some lovable characters who will definitely win the hearts of millions. Congrats to the entire Disney Animation studio, well done."
2,Bolt,8,8 January 2009,Some of the most fun you'll have at the movies this year,"Standing out in the crowd is not always the easiest thing to accomplish for an animated film, but above what you may expect, against WALL∙E's heart, and Kung Fu Panda's slapstick hilarity, Disney's Bolt jumps forward as simply the most fun. What makes Bolt noteworthy as well as a success on its own terms is its ability to take an age-old message about being true to oneself and finding your inner hero, and mesh it with a unique storyline that ends up spawning what, at first glance at least, seems wholly unique. Coupled with the expectedly bright crisp animation and stellar voice work, makes Bolt better yet, and a sure contender for best animated film at this years Oscars. Bolt also reclaims the original song work of Disney past, conceived between its also star and teen sensation Miley Cirus and Jenny Lewis and both compilations are memorable and sweet. Bolt never dives for the heartstrings, but scores its emotional points through well developed characters and thoughtful situations. Bolt opens with a very entertaining action sequence in which Bolt (voiced to surprising effect by John Travolta) and his master Penny (Miley Cirus) are chased by well equipped super villains which plays out in the vein of The Incredibles. The genetically altered canine can leap helicopters in a single bound, melt evil with laser eyes and destroy villains at a whim with his super-bark. It is soon revealed that the action speckled lives of Penny and Bolt is in fact a hit television show, which requires Bolt to be kept in the dark about the nature of his existence; in brief, he actually believes he has super powers. But after a cliff-hanger ending of an episode in which Penny is taken, prompts Bolt to escape, determined to reclaim his friend and master. Embarking for the first time into the real world he haphazardly enlist the help of a very reluctant cat (Susie Essman) and a fan-boy err...fan- hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton) and along the way learns, and earns, the true stripes of a hero and that of friendship. If everything I mentioned above was not enough to make you see this film, I can also reveal that Bolt is an at times hilarious send-up of the movie industry and genre clichés. Propelled by the hilarious supporting voice work including Malcolm McDowell, Dietrich Bader and James Lipton the blend of comedy, drama, and flat out entertainment value is unmatched. Also worth an enthusiastic mention are the pigeons that show up throughout the course of Bolt's adventure. Not only (as with all) is the voicing perfect but the physical humour implored is gut-busting, with the feathery fools twitching their heads in a pigeon- esquire way during their meetings with Bolt to glorious results. If you have a chance, you obviously should see this film in 3-D, however it is still well worth your money viewed in a traditional medium. Bolt is a reminder of why Disney was such an animation juggernaut and it is pleasant to see them recapturing some of their past glory. And just in case you want it mentioned bluntly, yes there are many jokes that older patrons will more then enjoy. It is always refreshing to see an old formula revamped so effectively and certainly always welcome to see a movie that can put a smile on faces of all ages. 8.5 / 10.0View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
3,Bolt,,13 January 2009,So delightfully entertaining!,"This film is about a dog that believes his friend is in grave danger. What he does not know is that he is the star of a reality TV show.Who would have thought ""Bolt"" would be so thrilling and entertaining! The opening action sequence is rushed with adrenaline, it excites me even though it is an animation! The plot is intelligent, interesting and fun, the great thing is that it entertains without the need of any toilet or gross out humour. The super-bark and laser eye scenes are so hilarious, in a cute and mesmerising way. In addition, the transition of Bolt from being a super dog to realising he he has no powers is very well presented, that it makes me feel sad for Bolt. The animation is flawless, and all the characters in the animation are super cute. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of ""Bolt"", I think it makes perfect family entertainment."
4,Bolt,10,14 February 2009,"Easily my favorite Disney film, and perhaps my absolute favorite movie of all time","The 2000s have not been very kind to Walt Disney Animation. While there has been the occasional Emperor's New Groove or Lilo and Stitch, the majority of their films from this decade have been rather mediocre (most notably 2005's Chicken Little, which - ironically - remains the studio's highest-grossing film of the 2000s). With that said, I initially had some doubts about Bolt, despite hearing that it would be Disney Animation's first film supervised by Pixar founder John Lasseter. The surprisingly positive reviews posted shortly before the film's release convinced me to buy a ticket. Thankfully, I was forced to eat my words; welcome back, Disney.The film revolves around Bolt, a white German Shephered who has spent his entire life on the set of a TV show in which he portrays a ""superdog"". As a result, he believes that the events on film (and his super powers) are real. When he is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood soundstage to New York City, he embarks on a cross-country journey to reunite with his owner and co-star, Penny. Along the way, Bolt teams up with a jaded alley cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino who also happens to be an extreme Bolt fanboy.First of all, the effects in this movie are unbelievable. Everything in the movie looks so realistic and yet doesn't contradict with the animated cartoon-esquire characters. Also, while Bolt is obviously the star of the movie, the real comedy comes from his unlikely companions. In fact, my favorite character of the bunch is Mittens the cat, voiced excellently by Susie Essman. Very seldom do I hear/see a character and say ""I can't imagine anybody doing a better job playing him/her"", but Essman really brings a lot to this already memorable character. And though I found him to be pretty irritating at first, some of the best lines in the movie come from Rhino the hamster.Lastly, in one of the opening scenes we see Bolt as he is in the TV Show to set the understanding of Bolt's world. Seriously, that was made of awesome. The scene was action packed and full of excitement. I would watch the show that Bolt is in. If I had to have a complaint, it would be that it takes some ideas from several other films (such as Homeward Bound, Toy Story, and The Truman Show). That said, it still manages to feel like its own film, and with grace.With terrific animation, an incredibly heartwarming story, and some of the most endearing characters I've ever seen on film (animated or otherwise), Bolt has not only become my favorite Disney film (Pixar included), but perhaps my absolute favorite movie of all time. It feels strange saying that, especially considering that I didn't even expect to like the film, but I simply can't think of a movie that I've loved more. It's also one of the very few films that manages to bring me to tears every time that I watch it, and when a movie is able to affect me on that kind of level, it automatically becomes a winner."
5,Bolt,10,15 November 2008,Grande,"I was really not expecting much, was looking to one of those generic ""newgen"" 3D animations but, oh, I was so wrong. I can easily say Bolt is pretty much at par with Wall-E, the 2 21th century animations that conquered my heart.Few times I laughed, few times I had watery eyes, and it's impossible not to adore the characters and be at the edge of the seat as you follow the story. Also really loved the ""authentic"" finale with Penny and Bolt. The Real D (my first ever 3D glasses movie too) was the cherry on the cake with the astonishing graphics."
6,Bolt,10,13 November 2008,Extremely entertaining - especially in 3D,"We got the opportunity to see this in a sneak preview in 3D and were very entertained. Great plot, great animation and the 3D was amazing. Sometimes felt like Bolt's head was towering over the audience. Good thing he didn't drool!All the characters were great. The pigeons were great comic relief. It's amazing the amount of detail the animators put in. Watching the way the pigeons moved their heads was entertaining in itself. Rhino and Mittens were also hilarious while having more depth as well. A lot of Rhino's great lines were in the preview but didn't exactly play out in the story the way they seemed like they were going to. Even with that, he was hilarious. Obviously the plot is predictable but it's a very fun story. We were laughing out loud throughout this movie. Skip Bond and see Bolt."
7,Bolt,10,30 March 2009,Truly A Disney Film!,"I can't remember any film produced by Disney that I ever disliked. Every movie they made, whether it's Pixar or not, is a great movie to watch. Bolt is no exception. In fact, this brings Disney to another level.This film is about the bonds of friendship between Bolt, a ""superdog"" and Penny, a young actress. Bolt thinks he has super powers but he he obviously does not. He realizes that when he takes a cross-country trek with a mangy cat and a weird hamster to save his human companion.I guess you could say the voiceovers are great. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus certainly did a good job.I liked the music in this film. I shouldn't be surprised because Travolta did star in Grease thirty years ago. The duet with Cyrus is a great song.This movie deserved to win some bigtime awards. The only reason this did not happen because Wall-E overshadowed this film.This is one of the best Disney animated films this decade. Actually, most of them are great animations. Anyway, I rate this film 10/10."
8,Bolt,10,23 December 2008,The best animation of the year,"""Wall-E"" was superb, I love and admire it/him, but ""Bolt"" does beat it! While the above mentioned (excellent!) movie did have some slow, insipid and predictable moments, in the spaceship setting - well, ""Bolt"" is coherent, self-consequent and true to itself from beginning to end! The script is based on a treasure of meanings: the world seen by the eye of a dog; the difference between fantasy and reality; the role of the audience in an entertainment project; and, first and foremost, the main idea: A DOG'S SUPER-POWER LAYS IN HIS FAITHFULNESS! Anyone who ever owned a dog knows how true (and sacred) a fact is this!Further, the same script is really intelligent - well structured and built up, with a solid dramaturgy and a captivating narration, right from the beginning. The starting premise, as expressed professionally, is: WHAT IF a dog, loyal with his life to his master, plays next to her the part of a super-dog in an action TV series? BUT WHAT IF, for him to act well, the trick is to make him believe that everything is true, and his super-powers are real? ...AND WHAT IF he gets lost by accident, and has to face the REAL WORLD (and his REAL SELF) to get back to his master? ...And this is how starts this truly initiatic trip, from New York City back to Hollywood, for the engaging Bolt, his acolyte Mittens (the stray cat who begins by being his sarcastic hostage, only to become his main supporter), and Rhino the hamster, his devoted fan. While the script continues in the same compact and fast-paced spirit, the direction adds up to it by being more than just adequate: it's expressive, enriching, imaginative, creative, bright. And what an admirable humor, what an elegant satire, what a perceiving look all over the American society, from the East Coast to California...! Of course, one should add that the graphics are superb, and the 3-D DOES WORK, friends and neighbors - it ceases at last to be just a cheap trick, and invests the story with style and perspective (not only at an optical level!) One last word, and the most important: yes, I'm an old bastard, harshly dragged along thousands of movies - but, when Bolt chose to die next to Penny, I wept."
9,Bolt,8,12 February 2009,"Lost Super-Puppy, Answers to the Name of Bolt. If Found, Please Contact The Incredibles...","I've read that Bolt is the first computer animated feature to come from Disney Studios since Pixar's John Lasseter took control of it, and it's easy to see the Pixar presence in the movie. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus provide the celebrity voice talent for the movie, about a dog who stars in a superhero TV show but who is just as unaware that he's an actor as he is that he's a dog. Remember at the end of A Bug's Life when they animated together some outtakes where shots from the movie were messed up because of various mishaps on set? I thought that was one of the most charming ideas in an already fun and entertaining movie, and in Bolt they have taken that and centered an entire movie around it. Bolt and Penny are a team battling the evil green-eyed man, who has kidnapped Penny's father and are attempting to extract information out of him. Between shooting sessions, Bolt lives in a trailer, unaware that Penny is going home to her real life and that the world returns to normal when he's not around. He believes that he is exercising extraordinary restraint in not using his superpowers to teach a lesson to a couple of wise-cracking alley-cats who tease him through the roof vent of his trailer at night. Through a series of unfortunate events initiated by an encounter with the cats, Bolt finds himself accidentally shipped in a box to the east coast, from where he must travel across America in the real world in his quest to become reunited with Penny.In watching a movie about a cute superhero who suddenly finds himself in the real world and must gradually accept the heartbreaking news that there's nothing special about him, it's impossible not to think of Buzz Lightyear, who suffered through exactly the same situation in Toy Story almost 15 years ago, but even though this seems to point to a disappointing characterization weakness in the movie, it is the characters who are the most interesting.There is nothing particularly fresh or interesting about Penny, who is really nothing more than a catalyst to drive Bolt's adventure, and even Bolt himself is giving us a predictable performance of a dog who thinks he has superpowers, but the characters that he meets along the way are the best things about the movie.He encounters a hardened alley-cat in New York named Mittens who has been bullying pigeons into making regular food donations to her (a clear homage to the bullying grasshoppers in A Bug's Life). She and Bolt become tied together with a leash and he forces her to help him get to California. But it's the even smaller characters that are the most interesting and charming. The Italian-American pigeons that Bolt meets in New York, who just know that they know his face from somewhere but can't quite place it, are incredibly well-animated and cleverly voiced.But my favorite is Rhino, a superfan of Bolt's TV show whom Bolt and Mittens meet in a trailer park on their way to the west coast. Rhino will be a popular favorite character from the movie. He's overcome with excitement at meeting his hero, and it provides a unique comedic situation when both he and Bolt think that Bolt has super-powers, while Mittens must pacify them in order to get what she wants. She has been dragged scratching and screaming into this situation, and her disbelief at her miserable luck provides a good portion of the movie's comedy.The family content of the movie plays up the ongoing cats and dogs rivalry that I don't remember seeing this directly portrayed since the relatively disappointing 2001 film Cats & Dogs. In one of the movie's more amusing sequences, Mittens teaches how to beg, and he successfully gets one trailer park family after another to offer food to his puppy-dog begging skills. When Mittens tries it, she gets a frying pan flung at her. The movie knows how to work the comedy of a computer animated feature, which is why it was nominated for a Best Animated Feature Oscar and is also why it's a lot of fun, but beneath the clever screen-writing and occasionally amazing animation, the standard-issue cartoon-messages of never abandoning a friend in need make the rest of the movie pretty un-spectacular.Bolt deserves to be nominated as one of the best animated features of 2008, but it also deserves to come in behind Kung Fu Panda, the second best animated feature of the year, and WALL-E, which will win."
10,Bolt,9,15 November 2008,Disney finally puts out a winner!,"Over the past few years Disney track record in new movies has been questionable. With the exception of Meet the Robinsons (which I quite liked), Disney has done nothing but pump out rehashed ideas in the form of inane sequels to classics loved by my generation or weak under developed characters. Well not this time. I managed to see an advanced screening of this tonight with my daughter and it had both of us highly entertained. Bolt the ""super"" dog was full of funny and emotional characters the likes of which Disney has not produced in a while. And for once the comic relief characters, of which there are many, did their jobs and pulled even the slowest of moments out of the trash and send you rolling in the aisles. Rhino the hamster was my personal favorite. After seeing this movie all my daughter could say was how awesome it was and ask if we could see it again. I had to remind her that it actually does not come out until next week. Well to sum it up I would recommend to children young and old and while I have not seen it yet in 3D I plan too because it was easy to see that 3D is going to make the movie even more exciting."
11,Bolt,10,17 February 2009,"Wow, this is Disney at it's best","Now don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of animation and I loved recent films like WALL-E and Kung Fu Panda, but this one is without doubt the best animated film this year or the last.Bolt is a hilarious, funny, sometimes sad and incredibly enjoyable film. The characters are highly memorable and the story far more engaging and exciting than most other animations, yes WALL-E included.It carries the classic elements of a children's story, combined with a modern day setting. Think Dick King Smith's 'Find the white horse' mixed with 'The Incredibles' and that gives you a scope of the feel of this film.Without doubt this is a classic that brings back Disney's claim to fame. The plot is clever, with several homages to earlier Disney films and will keep you engaged all the way through unlike in WALL-E or Kung Fu Panda, which are both brilliant (The latter more so) but have some scenes where you want to leave the cinema quickly and go buy more sweets until the good stuff comes back.WALL-E will beat this film in rating (Thought this one deserved to be better) for the simple reason that more people will pay attention to a film about a little lost robot, than a film about a dog who thinks he has superpowers. Go into the cinema, with an open mind and no prejudice, i.e. 'said film' is better so I refuse to enjoy this!and you'll see exactly what I mean. Trust me I didn't think it would be good but Wow was I wrong.This is an excellent film with none of those, 'Geez i'm glad the kids didn't understand that joke' moments which makes it all the better than films that try to sneak those in every so often. Bolt is awesome!I wont give you any spoilers other than rhino the hamster is hilarious and all three of the main characters will make you laugh out loud, I've never been in a cinema with so many people laughing before! Long story short, watch this film, trust me, it's engaging where others are not, its funny and the characters are lovable. This is Disney's best yet, that includes anything PIXAR have done and deserves to win whatever awards it's nominated for. Great for kids and adults alike, you wont be disappointed. It has those great moral undertones everyone seems to be such a fan of on here too! No seriously though, they work. very well.Enjoy the film and watch out for Styrofoam!"
12,Bolt,10,16 November 2008,It was a BOLT of entertainment,"This movie was enjoyable all around. I saw a special screening last tuesday and it was great. I found that kids felt they were intwined with in the movie. It made you feel like you were right there helping out Bolt and his friends. The character traits and development were well done. From the pigeons of New York to the pigeons in California every character had their own special personality. The graphics were superb and it made you feel as if the movie was real. John Travolta does the voice of Bolt. I wasn't sure if at first he was a good choice, but he made Bolt his own. Miley Cyrus was really good as the voice of Penny. She did well and her timing was great, but the real character that made this movie was Rhino the Hamster. He steals every scene and you and your kids will be quoting his lines for weeks to come. I saw take your kids to see this and don't worry it is great for adults too."
13,Bolt,6,26 November 2008,"Tough to rate, it's cute but very unoriginal","Bolt, I honestly don't know what to say about this film because honestly I feel bad about saying this, I love Disney so much, but this movie didn't do anything for me. First off this was one of the strangest casts, I do like John Travolta, but I just couldn't see him as Bolt for some reason, his voice just threw me off completely. Miley Cyrus, this movie became more about her and I think they were just trying to attract her fans to this movie. The only thing that I really did enjoy from Bolt was the hamster, Rhino, he was just absolutely cute, he could have been annoying, but he's like the ultimate fan that loves you so much that it turns around and you like him right back. The animation, it was decent, 3-D is just becoming so huge this year I think. The story is just The Truman Show with a dog, it also kind of reminded me of Homeward Bound, so this is something we've seen before.A super-dog named BOLT, whose days are filled with danger and intrigue-at least until the cameras stop rolling. When the star of a hit TV show is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood sound stage to New York City, he begins his biggest adventure yet-a cross-country journey through the real world to get back to his owner and co-star, Penny. Armed only with the delusions that all his amazing feats and powers are real, and the help of two unlikely traveling companions-a jaded, abandoned house cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino -Bolt discovers he doesn't need superpowers to be a hero.While I wasn't into this movie, I think it's a great family film, especially for the kids, it's a guaranteed fun time for them. The characters are cute, but it's Rhino and Mittens who steal the show. I don't know about you, but I think this movie had a little bit of a rip off from Animaniacs, those pigeons in the beginning reminded me too much of the Goodfeathers and Mittens reminded me a bit of Rita, if you've seen the show, you know what I'm talking about and will agree with me. Bolt is worth the look, but I'm not that impressed with it, watch it with the kids and for the fun 3-D stuff. The story is just a little unoriginal but the characters make it worth your while.6/10"
14,Bolt,8,15 November 2008,A Near-Perfect Family Comedy,"It's official. Disney is finally back! ""Bolt"" is a return to the old formula of having a story that works on both the level of entertaining the kids with jokes, and keeping the parents watching with a touching character-based story.At its base level, ""Bolt"" is quite possibly the funniest animated film that Disney has ever made. And thankfully, the best humor was not wasted on the movie's trailers. You think you've seen it, but oh, there's so much more! The audience at my theater, kids and parents alike, were laughing like crazy throughout the film, including one joke that kept them laughing for a good minute afterward. (I wouldn't dare spoil it here.) Rhino, the little hyperactive TV-obsessed hamster who has no idea how small he is, steals the show. Almost everything that he does is worth a good laugh, and all of his humor is perfectly in-character... not annoying in the least bit, unlike the Disney sidekicks of the 90's. And there are no fart jokes or potty humor, or other such overly-easy kid-friendly jokes that make adults smack themselves on the heads. It's classic character-based humor, which everyone can appreciate, throughout the film.The movie's base premise, a character who thinks he's something extraordinary when he's really not, may sound like a rehash of ""Toy Story,"" but it isn't. They only sound similar on paper. The execution, and what the film's drama and basic plot points focus on, are completely different. In ""Toy Story,"" Buzz's ignorance was self-induced, while in ""Bolt,"" Bolt's ignorance is the fault of the studio, who keeps him ignorant for the sake of making a more convincing show. ""Bolt"" is more of a story about love overcoming cruelty than a self-actualization one.As a serious film, ""Bolt"" works for the most part. The first 30 minutes or so, from the opening pet shop scene to the end of the Ohio trailer park scene, are spectacular, showcasing the lightning-fast action scenes that Bolt thinks are real, plus using the wonderfully detailed and subtle character animation, (which is remarkably lifelike,) to capture the tender Penny-playing-with-Bolt moments. You really feel for Penny and Bolt because of how believable the animation is, and those first images of them together really stick in your head throughout the film.The only place where the story fizzles out a bit is in the middle and some parts of the end. The parts where Bolt actually learns that he is not in fact a super dog, and has to cope with it, were not redundant, but they certainly weren't inspired either. It kind of rushes through them, and doesn't dwell on them, which makes such an intense change in character a lot less significant than it could have been. (This is not a spoiler, by the way... the plot shifts in a completely different direction once this part, which everyone knew was coming, is over.) I personally think this lack of perfection is because the team had only 2 years to finish the film after Sanders left, and didn't have time to iron out the story and dialog in the middle. This keeps the movie from being a masterpiece. If the whole film was as good as the first 30 minutes, it could have been. As is now, it is still a sensational family comedy achievement, but falls just short as a serious character-study film.Nonetheless, ""Bolt"" is one of Disney's best films from the last 10 years, and is not to be missed. The kids at the theater unanimously loved it, especially loving the hamster. If you have a family, don't miss it! If you like good light-hearted comedies, don't miss it! If you're a lone Disney fan holding out for the return of the near-perfect character, music, and epic animation, though, you might have to wait until next year's ""The Princess and the Frog."" ""Bolt"" is certainly a treat, but is still just short of the levels of the 90's Disney Renaissance."
15,Bolt,9,19 February 2009,Makes a change to see a kids film that was good.,"Being a mom means you have to take the kids to the cinema. Over the past couple of years I have seen some awful films, Monster House and Cars are two that come to mind.Bolt, to be honest I wasn't looking forward to seeing it, but I am glad I did, I loved it, it wasn't overly preachy or sentimental. It was well paced and didn't try to be something it wasn't. There were no innuendo jokes that were there for the parents and the thing I did notice was that the parents were laughing a long with the children. Some wonderful lines, good animal characterisation, and a kick-ass hamster. What more could you ask for."
16,Bolt,,15 February 2009,Exceptional!,"I think the title of this review, in my opinion, sums up Bolt in one word. The adorable characters and the action-packed sequences left your emotions going all over the place in this one of a kind animated adventure.The outline story is about a dog, but this dog is slightly different from the rest, he is a legend of the small screen as the star of his own TV show, Bolt; a super-dog that will do all it takes to protect his owner and best friend, Penny. There is just one big problem, Penny is Bolt's actual real owner, who never gets any time with Bolt outside filming for the TV show, and Bolt believes that the show that he stars in is actually for real. He believes he has superpowers and is always on the looking out stop the 'green-eyed' villain from getting hold of Penny.One day in film production, a scene featuring Penny being kidnapped by the bad guys sends Bolt running out of the studio and going to look for Penny believing that she really has been kidnapped.The film sees Bolt in the real world (where he has no super powers) and discovers who he really is. Along the way he 'captures' a cat (who he sees as a villain) called Mittens, and bumps into a rather hyper-active hamster (Rhino).The films has a mix of genres, and Rhino provides a lot of funny dialogue, which works really well.Another treat in this film is that you can see it in 3D, and it really makes it so much more realistic, I loved how the 3D made the action sequences so realistic. at you from the screen, one bit that really sticks in my mind was the syringe coming at you! I would definitely recommend seeing it in 3D.However, there is one thing that, for me personally, made this fantastic. From what I've heard and read many people have said that it was 'hilarious' and a great animated comedy. For me, I don't think the comedy was the best bit. What I really liked about this film was that it had heart. I loved watching Bolt making discoveries about himself that he never knew about (e.g. the window on the trailer scene) which was full of warmth, music in these scenes in particular worked very well indeed. It left you feeling really emotional. But then it was a scene near the end that really did it for me, after all the action, the heart and determination of Bolt really did bring a tear to my eye, something I don't think any other animated film has ever done. Was it the 3D that made it so realistic (you could almost feel Bolt's fur) or the great work done on the animation, a combination of both? Never have I come out of an animated film feeling so emotional. Before seeing this film I read a quote from the chief creative officer of Disney animated studios who said that he believed in the words of Walt Disney himself ""for every laugh, there should be a tear"". They got it spot on in 'Bolt'.Overall, I can't express enough how awesome 'Bolt' is. By far I would recommend you see this one of a kind film."
17,Bolt,9,7 December 2008,A good day guaranteed!,"Ridonculous! Bolt has the audience in the pad of his paw from beginning to end.A white American shepherd who plays a hit TV series' superdog hero, Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) leads a Truman Show life: he thinks his superpowers are real and believes that his sci-fi adventures with his person Penny (Miley Cyrus) are serious. When Bolt accidentally strays from the confines of his studio lot world, he embarks on a real-life quest to find his person and protect her from the evil Dr. Calico. He gets into true-to-life troubles himself, encountering genuine characters along the way: a trio of pigeons, Mittens the alley cat (Susie Essman) and fan-hamster Rhino (Mark Walton). Ally McBeal's Greg Germann provides the voice for Penny's scheming Agent, while The Drew Carey Show's Diedrich Bader is the voice for the Veteran Cat.It may be executive-produced by Pixar's John Lasseter and has tinges of his comedy stylings, but Bolt is fully a Disney creation. Having Lasseter on board ensures that the adults in the audience will probably have an even better time than the kids. The animation is impressive, as it delivers the drama and emotion, as well as the laughs and the Fully Awesome action! It would just be really difficult not to smile and swoon at Bolt and his sidekicks. Watch it and have a good day guaranteed!"
18,Bolt,10,25 November 2008,The Best Disney cg Movie Ever!,"I watched this at a screening w/ the directors. it was completely totally awesome. =] I had an awesome time. The movie was fantastic. I saw some of the production work (final and storyboard) phase of the movie and I could tell already that this movie will touch the hearts of many and especially pet lovers.The film - I really enjoyed the beautiful lighting and how Disney just blows the minds my mind with it. The different colors used to set the moods, the different palettes at different locations, the patter, and etc to set the environment as he travels across N. America. I can see the old traditional side of Disney is coming back especially with John Lasseter heading up the creative side. The color to this movie really does set the mood and the beautiful details and painterly affect developed by Disney really made the movie just much more unique and emotional... with the soft brush effects.You should not go into this movie criticizing it because of Miley or what not... or whatever... go in open minded. =] the movie will take your breath away. Especially the action scenes at the beginning of the movie - completely astounding and breathtaking.I love the script it was creative and it really hits the heart and soul. As much as this story has changed throughout the production... it still stays true to the main theme. The movie brought tears to my eyes during the climax of the movie when Bolt realize he was not a dog, or when Mittens tells her past life... the movie in itself has so much depth. The entire Vegas scene (Vegas being fake... etc etc.) It really takes you on this journey across North America and you can really emotionally feel what Bolt is going through as he travels and seeing that open landscape... what is real. (pay attention to Bolt's fur color as he travels across N. America. =] They put a lot of thought process into this.) The composition of the movie was great I loved it. the camera angles used was awesome. I think Chris and Bryon and the rest of the creative team did a wonderful job. they put a lot of thought into the characters and its development. Again, the character development in this film did meet its marks. I loved the animation and the subtle movement of the ears on the animals. I loved the anticipation to it and just everything about the Animation... it was mind blowing. I loved the jokes they were very creative. I would go say more, but I'll leave it short and simple. =] You just have to watch this film."
19,Bolt,9,17 January 2009,what an awesome and adorable flick,"personally i'am not a fan of animation movies but when i saw this movie i completely fell in love with this movie.the bolt character is so well innocently designed that u cant stop laughing at his innocence not only bolt but the rhyno and cat characters are also well placed,i assure u that this movie will definitely keep u into it till the end and it is one of the best animation movies i have ever seen.if u wana watch a movie worth it then i will definitely recommend you to watch this because it not only entertains the kids but also the elders so its a must watch go get it if u have still not watched it"
20,Bolt,,25 January 2009,"The Incredible Journey...of a Dog, a Cat and a Hamster","After numerous duds, Disney has finally brought some quality entertainment on screen. Perhaps John Lasseter had a lot to do with it. The animation is similar to that of Pixar, detailed, vivacious and colourful. The story moves at a steady pace and even though it isn't anything new, it has its own charm and the adventurous feel. I loved the characters Bolt, Mittens and Rhino. They form a very entertaining trio. Travolta, Essman and Walton are great together. The Penny character is clichéd and Miley Cyrus's bad voice acting doesn't help much but thankfully she's not the main lead. I am also additionally glad that none of her songs appeared in her soundtrack other than the one she terribly sang with Travolta. The pigeons were laugh-out-loud hilarious. I loved how they moved their heads in a darting motion. If one took notice, the three pigeons in the beginning move differently from the three that appear in the end. 'Bolt' is the Disney movie that one has been waiting for. It's probably been ages since they have had a winner (the last one being 'Lilo and Stitch'?) and it's good to see them back with something solid."
21,Bolt,9,22 November 2008,Lightning BOlt,"BOLT may not be in the same class as WALL-E but it's still just as entertaining, touching and genuine as any other great animated films that have more than meets the eye. I like watching movies like BOLT because you're bound to not only... have a good time but you'll also get that mushy feeling from its heartfelt story. No matter how tough you think you are, the themes of friendship, family, loyalty will always get you every single time. Definitely a must-see! Especially if you have pets If I were to say anything against BOLT's graphics and animation, it would be like having watched the movie with my eyes closed because the fact remains, the amusing 3D visual effects that this movie treats you with will guarantee the most absolute thrilling, adventurous fun a family can enjoy. They say God is in the details, you'll be hugely impressed at the extent that this movie is willing to go to bring us the most surreal looking dogs or cats or pigeons, just as good, if not better than some of the other CG animated movies I've seen in recent years.Once again, the story will keep you at the edge of your seat. The fast-paced action sequences when BOLT is the show's superhero dog or even when he's not the superhero dog he thought he was. It can often be silly and yet you're glad it is.There's one character, the hamster named Rhino who is just the funniest sidekick since Dori in Finding Nemo. Rhino will get you laughing and laughing and you will beg for more.I gotta give props to John Travolta as the voice of Bolt, Travolta's got the ability to connect with his character and the audience, I'm aware it's just voice work but it's still hard work to make it convincing, he's got the comedic timing and the determination that is BOLT, the dog who is in total denial,.. motivated only by its hope that its person, Penny, will love him back.Watching BOLT is a lot like watching TOY STORY 2, there's that unlikely friendship and teamwork themes to it and at the same time, it's also about how the toy/pets' owners or the humans often would get to a certain point where they'd abandon their toys or their pets resulting in... stray animals walking the streets. The network show that got Bolt famous easily replaces him with another dog, that's how much one can take something for granted. BOLT could be like a spokesperson for animal shelters and adopt-a-pet organizations everywhere. It is truly a movie that's good for everyone of every age."
22,Bolt,9,27 November 2008,Bolt is a fine computer-animated feature from Walt Disney Pictures,"Though my friend who works at a movie theatre had already seen this, he agreed to watch it again with me. This was a thrilling, heartwarming, and funny Disney-computer-animated movie for me. All the voices were great from John Travolta and Miley Cyrus to the rest. This story of a German Shepard who lives a ""Truman Show"" life until he accidentally escapes and meets a cat and a hamster is entertaining from beginning to end. Do yourself and your family a favor and take everyone you know to watch this highly entertaining flick. Not quite Pixar-quality but pretty close. Hope it does even better with the kids out of school this Thanksgiving weekend. So what are you waiting for, just go!"
23,Bolt,8,10 December 2008,"Bolt out the door to see or purchase this one, it is very fun & cute","Bolt the dog (voiced by John Travolta) is the star of an espionage television series. His owner, teenager Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) is his co-star. On the show, Bolt possesses ""super"" powers and is able to stop trucks with his paws, start explosions with his ""stare"" and outrun the bad guys. However, he lives on the set, in his own trailer, and never leaves the premises, not even to go home for the weekend with Penny. Consequently, he is unaware that he is an ordinary dog but, instead, he truly believes he is a superdog. Therefore, on the day that two pestering cats entice him to leave his trailer, he finds himself out in the ""real"" world. After a mishap, he ends up in a delivery truck to New York City, far away from Hollywood. Still thinking his special skills will get him home pronto, he is in for a rude awakening. But, through the help of a stray cat named Mittens (Susie Essmann) and a hamster named Rhino (Mark Walters), he begins the long cross-country journey. Will he make it? This film was cute and fun, with very nice animation and a clever script. There is a touch of violence, especially at the beginning, for the world of the superhero is rarely without danger, even on a television show. So, perhaps the film is unsuitable for the very youngest viewers. However, the cast is wonderful, with Travolta doing an excellent job as the voice of Bolt. Cyrus, too, is touching in her role as Penny, while Essmann and Walters are really superb additions to the film. All of the lesser characters are voiced very nicely, too, especially Malcolm McDowell as the pipes of the main heavy. The animation is colorful, skillful and very realistic, resulting in an attractive movie. Then, too, the score is quite fine, with Travolta and Cyrus doing a duet near the film's end. All in all, if you care about quality films for families, bolt out the door and arrange a viewing of Bolt. Everyone will be yapping with delight as the film runs its course."
24,Bolt,7,15 November 2008,Great animated action/comedy.,"I saw a preview screening of ""Bolt"" just a short while ago. The theater was packed. It turned out to be very funny and enjoyable film. Bolt is a dog that thinks his superpowers are real. He works with his owner, Penny, in a action shown on TV. Bolt runs away when Penny leaves him for the night. He goes all over the place to find her and meets some other animals along the way. The characters in the movie are all very creative and funny, especially the hamster who turns out to be a big fan of Bolt. There is also a character named Mittens (a stray alley cat) that Bolt meets about half way through the movie. This may not be the best animated film you will ever see, but it is still one worth seeing. I would recommend this movie to anyone- not just kids."
25,Bolt,,17 May 2010,"Surprisingly Good, A Return to Form for Disney","I had my doubts. In the recent years, Disney feature animation has had hits and misses. ""Bolt"" sounded like a very interesting concept four year before its 2008 release, when it was to be directed by Chris Sanders (""Lilo & Stitch"") and to be titled ""American Dog"". The idea had potential, but it was eventually scrapped. When I saw the trailer for ""Bolt"", I felt both satisfied and disappointed. I take it back...If anything, ""Bolt"" shows that Disney is going in the right direction in terms of storytelling. It's too bad that Disney threw it out against big blockbusters and it couldn't make a massive amount of money at the box office. It's a shame, because this probably Disney's most Pixar- ish film. You could almost say it was as good as Pixar. ""Bolt"" sported a great story, fine performances and some great action scenes, along with some emotional content in the story.TV superstar Bolt believes he is actually a superhero, until he sees the world for the first time outside of his trailer and the studio. His adventures pair him with a sarcastic cat named Mittens and the obnoxious hamster named Rhino, who is a huge fan of Bolt. Bolt goes on a cross-country trip to find his owner Penny, and on the way, he realizes he's not really a superhero, as it was all a television show.The entire set-up for that was perfectly done. That's what made ""Bolt"" different from the other Disney films, it was unique and it was unpredictable at times. It had a different storyline. What also worked was the action sequences. The film was very fast-paced, it started up with a short intro and a thrilling action scene and throughout the film, it was an action-packed adventure. Aside from that, there was a good narrative and great characters. The comedic bits were very funny for a modern Disney film.""Bolt"" felt very Pixar-ish. ""Meet the Robinsons"" also felt like a Pixar effort, as Disney seems to be going their direction in storytelling. If Disney keeps this up and their attempts to revive traditional animation, they can be a top dog in the animation industry. It has some small flaws that keep from being a perfect 10, but it's definitely a Disney film worth watching. To this day, I wish I had seen it in theaters.A 9.6 out of 10."
26,Bolt,,24 April 2009,Very entertaining animated film.,"I saw this on a flight out west, so picture and sound are impossible to judge and comment on, but I was able to enjoy the cute story. It is an old one, about the bond between two people being stronger than the situations around them. The two ""people"" in this story are a little girl and a dog.As the movie begins we see a fantastically powerful and faithful dog named Bolt (voiced by John Travolta). As the scene goes on we eventually realize that we are seeing the filming of a TV series on a set. We further see that Bolt doesn't really have any special powers but the scenes are set up to fool even Bolt, and he thinks (as a dog may be able to ""think"") that he really is a super dog.As script fate would have it, Bolt finds himself in the real world, and accidentally in a shipping box headed across the country to New York. There he escapes and soon finds out his super powers are not super anymore. Much of the middle of the movie involves Bolt's escapades in trying to get back to Hollywood, and partner up with Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) who he thinks is his real owner instead of just an actress.Penny also considers herself more than just an actress, and missed Bolt, while studio bosses try to convince her that a different dog can play Bolt, since ""the show must go on."" SPOILERS: Bolt eventually makes it back, with the help of a cat and a hamster in a plastic bubble. At the studio Bolt makes it just in time for a big fire in the soundstage, one that the fake Bolt runs from. Meanwhile the real Bolt rushes in and saves Penny. They are reunited, more than just two actors."
27,Bolt,8,22 November 2008,Bolt (2008),"Perhaps I went in to the theater with expectations that were a little too high. I did enjoy many aspects of this film, such as the many Pixar references and the spoof of the Hollywood entertainment industry in general. The gags involving the pigeons from around the country was clever, and I loved the heavy national theme of this film. When I first heard about Bolt I was hoping for a scene like the one in which we see Bolt, Mittens, and Rhino traveling through the United States from East to West, and I was happy to see that they delivered in that respect.I found the plot to be a little unoriginal, as it reminded me of Homeward Bound, Finding Nemo, and even a little bit of Toy Story 2 all rolled into one. The Toy Story 2 similarity (Involving Mittens), however, was done very well and quite subtle, moreso even than Toy Story 2. I guess I've just been spoiled by Pixar, but I think it's clear that Disney Animation Studios hasn't quite broken out of its tendency to cater specifically to children, and I feel that Bolt is no exception.I did appreciate the imagery very much though; I felt the animation and settings were superb. It had a real sense of culture in addition to its emotional content, which is what reminded me of Finding Nemo. I actually think the best part of this film involves a certain character learning to let go of the Hollywood lifestyle and live more simply, with the help of those around him; that seemed to be a very universal message, and should have been the main plot of the film, I feel, because it was done so well, and was very heartfelt and sincere. I think this is a story that is going to hit home the hardest for animal-lovers, as they will be able to relate best to the main plot, but I feel that everyone can find something about this film to relate to and laugh about, no matter what your age or geographical location.A respectable 8/10."
28,Bolt,,11 January 2009,Locked Door,"This is a children's film in the modern mold. That means it has to have cinematic values that effect and impress, and at the same time sport an acceptable message. Usually it about the value of family and finding self; here it is both. That means that these films have a built in bicameral tension, one foot in the future, danger, adventure and the other in manufactured notions of domestic comfort.Regular readers know that I am a student of folded narrative, a simple example being what we have here: a film world within a filmed ""real world."" There are all sorts of narrative advantages that result from this device and they seem to work better when the film is animated. Something about acknowledged abstraction. The tip-off is in the first seconds where you see that the girl is redheaded.Supposing you can tolerate or are immune to the dangerous ""message,"" this will be great fun.There's a sort of metastory here, like that one of fifty years ago when Disney changed the nature of cinema everywhere. Here it is Pixar  and specifically John Lassiter, changing film AND Disney.Pixar has three signatures; you can see them all here plus a quote.The first is the obvious: the ability to render and move three dimensional characters in ways that more acutely convey the dramatic effects. All of these ways have their origin in ordinary theater well before film. But here they are engineered to be conveyed in ways impossible with real humans.Pixar was the first and for a long time the only animation studio to actually worry about the story. Disney now in this does as well.Pixar still is the gold standard for experimenting with the use of space. I mean that both in the sense of framing the scene physically and with the camera. The combination of the two is especially advanced. As with the acting, the goal is to do things that work and enhance the goals of the narrative, but which are not physically possible with ""real"" sets and cameras. You can see that used here, especially in the movie-within chase scenes at the beginning, which notably are more extreme than the rest in all three of these values.Quite apart from the general Pixar influence, you can see it in each of the three script teams.The basic script team owns the story with the pretty sophisticated notions of folding and redheads.The comic script team owns the gerbil. He's probably a quarter of the film and 80% of the laughs. You can see his importance in the folding as well: when you do something as here (where one character is ""bolted"" in/into two folds), you need to have an observer who similarly spans the two. Hence the gerbil. But then he was turned over to the comic team.You can also see the influence of a third team, which I am sure came from Pixar. They own the pigeons. There are three main groups of three, plus others scattered around. Their rendering and motion can be traced all the way back to ""For the Birds."" All their jokes are Pixar in-jokes. All their mannerisms are more nuanced, and I imagine that they were actually used in educating the Disney crowd. In true selfreferential style, they left references in.For instance, when we first meet some pigeons we see the theatrical personalities in their head cocking. Then they talk about it and instruct Bolt in how to hold his head (to extricate from a fence). Later, we see a similar tutorial from the cat to the same character for begging. Students of animation will know this as an exercise to move Disney away from their similar keynote scene in ""Lady and the Tranp"" of 50 years ago.There's the Nemo joke, tied to aliens and when we first see aliens in the ""new"" film within, it uses a shot taken, yes, from Nemo which in turn is patterned after Ridley Scott's film. Not ""Alien"" exactly but ""Bladerunner.""Check out how the ""moviewriter"" pigeons send one off to get whole grain (which is not whole wheat) and how that is mirrored in the all-important introduction of Mittens.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
29,Bolt,10,9 December 2008,Simply Adorable and funny,"My dad decided to being me and my brothers to the movies the other day, we have a little brother so we decided to see Bolt. I had a good attitude walking into the movie, and I walked out of the movie with an even greater attitude.Bolt was simply Adorable. The animation was very impressive, and really brought everything to life. I loved Bolt, and I was a huge fan of the character of Mittens, and especially Rhino. Mixing these three animals on a team was a weird concept, but it turned out to be funny and lovable. Very nice plot, nice characters, and overall tells a cute little story that turned out very funny. I smiled almost the whole way through. The only set back was that I simply DESPISE Miley Cyrus. Besides that, I enjoyed this movie more than Kung Fu Panda which I also loved, but doesn't quite live up to Wall-e.If your given the opportunity to see this movie, don't hesitate. It's worth the money and is STUNNING in 3D digital. 9/10 stars."
30,Bolt,10,22 November 2008,Impossibly heartwarming,"I had been wanting to see this movie since I first saw it advertised in theaters. It did not disappoint. Everything from the pigeons to the hamster to Penny's publicity agent was a riot. What I liked most about this movie was that although the preview showed many laugh out loud moments, the movie had much more to offer, both comedic and touching.Also, the first thing I wanted to do when I got out of the theater was run home and give my dog a big hug.Definitely a must see--the kids will love it for the cuteness factor, the adults will love it for the wit AND the cuteness factor."
31,Bolt,9,21 December 2008,Excellent Family Movie,"I saw this in 3D at the local IMAX and was very impressed with the story and the animation was superb. Seeing it in 3D really added a lot to the experience, although I'm sure it's just as enjoyable seeing it on a regular screen.The plot summary is Bolt is a dog who is a TV action hero (in Hollywood) who is kept in an artificial environment (similar to ""The Truman Show"") so that he actually believes he is the super action hero portrayed on the show. When he is lead to believe his owner, Penney, is in trouble, he escapes to try to save her but somehow ends up in New York City. Most of the story is his ordeal of getting back to Hollywood, with various sidekicks he picks up along the way.This was an excellent Pixar film, as enjoyable as ""The Incredibles"". Take the family, a date, or see it by yourself. It's a great movie."
32,Bolt,7,26 November 2008,Canis familiaris,"Story-wise, there's nothing remarkably new about ""Bolt,"" Walt Disney Animation's latest feature to hit the screens, but considering its patchy recent filmography, it's certainly a step to the right direction for the animation studio, now headed by Pixar-meister John Lasseter. While it's far below the sophisticated narratives and well-drawn characters of Pixar classics such as ""Toy Story,"" ""The Incredibles"" and this year's ""Wall-E,"" ""Bolt"" nevertheless charms its way to the screen with its eager-to-please lead character and diverting visuals.Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) is the canine star of a TV show where he plays a superdog whose lifelong mission is to protect his ""person"", Penny (Miley Cyrus), from the evil forces around them. Problem is, as the creators of the show fervently believe that the show's success lies mainly in its realism, they have gone to great lengths to lead Bolt into believing everything is real and everything seems to be going well.That is until a studio mishap has Bolt improbably shipped across the country from Hollywood to New York. With the help of Mittens (Susie Essman), an alley cat who strangely knows more about dog ways than Bolt himself, and Bolt-fanatic hamster Rhino (Mark Walton), he goes on a long cross-country tripping to find his way back to Penny.Byron Howard and Chris Williams direct a calculated script by Williams and Dan Fogelman where nothing is terribly special, especially if you're not a dog-loving tween girl (I do love dogs, though), though it has enough sensitivity (that's Lasseter working) up its sleeve for some unashamedly touching moments. And with its cheery visuals, lively characters and a breezy pace, it also has enough going for the adults as well as the kids. It's safe harmless stuff."
33,Bolt,7,7 March 2009,A nice family movie!,"Bolt is a fresh, light hearted family movie. Unfortunately though, it never raises itself above that level, it never delves into the greatness of Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc.However, it does show promise from the outset with fresh animation and a brilliant cast, perfectly pressed into the moulds of their characters. John Travolta is by far the stand out as Bolt, the naive canine, he provides the character with a depth that not many animation films seem to have nowadays.Miley Cyrus is, surprisingly, good in her role as Penny, the dog loving kid who can't stop until her four legged friend is found.The story is adequate, again with depth which isn't at the moment a necessary feature of an animated flick.Apart from a good cast and a decent storyline, Bolt falls somewhere in between Monsters Inc and Cars; whilst it may do its job as a good family film, it won't set your soul alight."
34,Bolt,9,7 February 2009,Disney taking time over release.,"Went to see Bolt last night. FANTASTIC MOVIE absolutely loved it. Saw it in 3D and the trailers for future movies seemed to almost all be in 3D on initial release. What is it with the 3D thing. The 3D effect in Bolt only really worked nearing the end of the film.I don't understand what has taken Disney so long to release it in Britain. When Enchanted came out in the States in mid November 07 it was released here 1 month later. For Bolt we've waited 3 months. It's due out on DVD in the States on 27th March. By the time it comes out in Britain, most will have bought the USA region 1 version. This makes no sense Disney. In times like these when studios are fighting illegal downloading and piracy, what is Disney playing at?The movie was worth the wait though. Go see it if you haven't."
35,Bolt,7,31 March 2009,"Uhm, well, cool for the kids...","The first minutes of the movie are actually dark; living into something you thought was real but was not. Bolt thought he was a superhero but he was just an ordinary dog- cute and cuddly and used. When I realized what is going on I kinda wished he was actually what he though he was. He was played really nice by the people he trusted, with all that busting power and importance- he was just a dog.But in fairness, this kiddie movie lifted up as it goes by. The atmosphere became the usual element of a kiddie movie which is adventure and fun. Animal cartoons ""anime"" is a product of frustrations of the reality, when one rich person cannot deal with reality; he resorts to something like cartoons. No dogs can really talk; special effects on a living actual dog might be insensibly costly.This movie made me rethink a hero does not have to the big stuff heroes always do which was presented at the beginning, because all that big stuff hero thing are fake. (I'm talking about charities and pictures and media.) The real hero is the one who is not afraid of doing the right thing even if all the people turned their faces away from him. Like Bolt we know at the end of the movie.This is not another hero movie, this is presentation of reality. The hamster in a cage, the cat who at first abused the weak- lives in a camouflage, the actress, the birds, and Bolt. You know what I mean."
36,Bolt,9,13 February 2009,Lasster puts Disney back on top,"i think it's safe to say i'm a huge Walt Disney fan i have been for as long as i can remember, i knew the words to the little mermaid song (part of your world) when i was 4. I've rarely seen a Disney film which i don't love. apart from of course ratatouille and the wild, honestly i have valid reasons for not liking them, Ratatouille first off, infuriated me with the year long add campaign which went on from valentines day 2007 until the DVD was released in Febuary 2008!! the on going ads just irritated me! as for the wild, it was a Blatant RIP-OFF of Madagascar (DREAMWORKS- the people who made Shrek, for those of you who seem to think Madagascar was Disney!) the only thing i liked about the film was Eddie Izzard! But recently since Pixar and Disney become one and John Lasseter from Pixar took the reins over at Disney Animation Studios. the films admittedly have made a fantastic impact upon the film industry, and especially me! Bolt is the first Disney Animation since John took over, it is the story of a young dog, who is the star of a television show in which he defeats bad guys, saves his owner penny and has awesome super powers, until of course, Bolt is safe in his trailer, then the set is taken down, of course Bolt is the star of a TV show with his owner penny, of course he is deluded into believing that he actually has these super powers.Bolt accidentally gets shipped across the country to NYC, bolt being under the impression that it is the work of the GREEN-EYED MAN, vows to somehow get back to Penny, of course his powers aren't real.Bolt faces the journey along with two sidekicks, Mittens an alley cat who helps but to understand his true dog self, and Rhino the eccentric, lovable, chunky, Bolt worshipping hamster! Rhino too believes that Bolt is a superhero and his courage and determination makes him somewhat remarkable.The film is definitely one which will make any animal lover cry (once, twice ... three times maybe!) and the comic genius of both Rhino and the Pidgeons is absolutely outstanding! The small cameo roles of the pigeons will no doubt keep you entertained with their mannerisms and their Ridonkulous Accents and stereotypes.It's a film i definitely recommend for any animal lover, young or old, it is definitely the best Disney film i have seen for a long time, it has knocked Cars from my number 1 favourite Disney movie.I think it's safe to say that Disney have taken a new turn and have come back on top thanks to John Lasseter."
37,Bolt,10,9 February 2009,Awesome!,"Well when I saw the trailer I wasn't quite sure how this would turn out, but I watched it anyway as animations tend to be some of the best films and this was an awesome film! The plot was good, clever and original. The characters were very believable and the animation was excellent, plus rhino was hilarious. It all runs very fluidly and the characters are very well developed throughout the film, to the point where you genuinely like each of the three main characters, at the least. A dog a cat and a hamster working together? That's got to be funny and it was! As far as animations go this is up there with the best, I'm very surprised it hasn't got much more attention. No doubt about it this is a great film."
38,Bolt,9,27 December 2008,A very good movie from Disney,"Bolt is the latest Disney's animation movie and the first made specially in 3-D. The movie is about A dog star of a fictional sci-fi/action show that believes his powers are real embarks on a cross country trek to save his co-star from a threat he believes is just as real. The story is good but it leaves you the sense of already been watched previously and the plot is pretty convincing although a little predictable. It is pretty enjoyable for the little kids but the adults will spend a really good time too. It is funny and it has pretty good action and adventure. The cast of voices is very good featuring John Travolta as Bolt and Miley Cyrus as Penny. The characters are very funny, specially Rhino the hamster and all the bunch of pigeons that appear throughout the movie. The animation is excellent already a constant on all Disney movies and if you watch it on 3-D even better. In conclusion, the movie is very good, not with the quality and as comical as the ones Pixar makes but its still worthy to watch, you will spend entertained for and hour and a half"
39,Bolt,9,25 November 2008,Great movie! A must-see!,"I had good expectations for this movie, and it was much more than I expected. It held up pretty well. This was a pretty good movie. John Travolta was excellent in his role as the TV star dog Bolt. The other roles were well-played. It has lots of humor and suspense. If you like humor, animals, and good endings, then this is the movie for you! The animation is simply amazing! It looks SO realistic! It has lots of funny scenes and quotes. (some were so funny, I nearly wet my pants laughing) It'll keep you entertained all the way through. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This is not a movie to be missed! I highly recommend it!"
40,Bolt,8,25 November 2008,Great Story Of True Friendship,"I saw this movie on Saturday with my girlfriend and we absolutely loved it. I can't remember having this much fun watching a Disney flick besides for Wall-E, but before that, jeez, Aladdin comes to mind. Yet this movie along with Wall-E were really, in my mind, the boosts that Pixar needed to really pick up from their last few films, that one with the rats (not Ratatouille), Shrek 3, Shrek 2, and others. Bolt is a heroic dog on a television show, yet he has no idea that it is a show and he believes that he has all these superpowers and what not. When Penny (his owner) is ""kidnapped"" he flees the set in hopes of finding Penny. Little does he know of the dangers that await him.Bolt is voiced beautifully by John Travolta, who I was skeptical about at first considering how old Travolta is and Bolt looking like a very young and restless pup. Yet Travolta's energy and charisma bring a wonderful dynamic to the brave lil pup. I hate Miley Cyrus, but her voice can be quite charming at times, I was actually drawn in by her. Mark Walton does the voice of Rhino, a fat hamster who is Bolts biggest fan. His crazy antics and adorably funny lines such as ""I eat danger for breakfast"" we'll have you laughing throughout the whole film.The pigeons in this film are, like others have stated, truly stunning. Their motions are perfect, including one beautiful scene when they fly off. The delay of the lift off to the actual movement of the wings is unbelievably choreographed. Great job on the pigeons Pixar! The animation of this film is great, definitely on par with other Pixar greats like Wall-E and Shrek.Overall, a great family film. I would recommend this to anyone who wished to avoid the Twilight crap, or someone who is just looking at watching a movie with some great laughs, along with some subtle comedic references to other media, and just altogether fun.8/10"
41,Bolt,4,15 April 2009,Couldn't Get Into The Characters Or Voice Of The Dog,"I find most animated films of late to be very entertaining. The best are the ones with a lot of humor. There are exceptions to that (""The Polar Express,"" for example) but humor seems to go hand-in-hand with animated feature films.I say all of the above because this Disney animated film, ""Bolt,"" wasn't too funny. Thus, at least for me, I didn't think this was involving and entertaining enough for me to care about the story much after the first half hour. I didn't find the characters appealing nor the story and I thought the graphics were overrated.I disagree with most of the national film critics who thought this was great. ""Penny,"" voiced by Miley Cyrus, was a bit aggravating and John Travolta doing the dog's voice was just too weird. Maybe I'm just not used to hearing Travolta's voice on animated films, but it just did not sound right here. It would up being a distraction from the story, and I see other reviewers here agree with me on that one.They lost me early on when the dog was shipped a long way in a box with no room to breathe, no air holes, and yet.....no problem. Hey, I know it's just fiction and a fun, animated movie but let's have some sense of realism on things like that.I'm normally easy to please with animated stuff, so it's unusual for me to be disappointed as I was with this one."
42,Bolt,10,15 November 2008,Brilliant and beautiful,We just went to the sneak preview on 11/15 and loved it as did the rest of the audience. I haven't seen this movie advertised that heavily but it should be a hit. It's a great film for parents and kids. From a storyline standpoint - It's helpful to explain the story a little bit to kids under 10 for them to be able to follow it. It plays well to both kids and adults though. The main characters are very well developed and endearing. Loved the hamster and the cat too. The story moves along at a good pace and is engaging the whole way -- funny but also touching. From a design/artistic standpoint - it's amazing!
43,Bolt,8,16 June 2010,Cute film,"Bolt it's a cute film, which is very enjoyable from beginning to end. Unlike other Disney films using CGI animation, the plot was nice and very well developed and the characters were very likable (Specially Rhino the hamster, which was one of the best characters ever made by Disney) The animation, without having the same level of detail of Pixar, it is still pretty good, and the voice performances, without being incredible, are adequate, and fit very well for all the characters. The songs were good too, and fit very well with the tone of the film Even when ""Bolt"" isn't a masterpiece, it is a highly enjoyable film for all the ages, and it is a big improvement in comparison with other CGI Disney films like ""Chicken Little"" and ""The Wild""."
44,Bolt,8,15 March 2009,"You'll Love it, even if you are not a kid!","Bolt: A story of a Dog (rather a Super Dog) living in an illusionary world discovers himself. He was raised in a manner that made him believe that he is the guardian, a protector of a young girl from the evil forces that are behind the inventions of penny's scientist father. One day he accidentally comes out his cocoon and get the taste of the real world packed and shipped to the other part of country, situations made him realize that he is not the Super-dog with super powers he thinks he has but he is just a dog. His journey from one coast to another is certainly exhilarating and entertaining, where he discover his real 'dog-self'.The animators and script writers have done amazing work and even worked out the tiniest detail. The manner in which pigeons speak is a good example of that. At the end I can just say that its worth watching and enjoyable even if you are not a kid anymore...."
45,Bolt,7,6 February 2009,A welcome eye opener to where the animated film industry may be headed.,"It's getting to the point now where, introducing the latest three-dimensional feature with an introductory paragraph relating to the history and general makeup of the 3D movie is becoming redundant. In today's cinematic climate, it is quickly becoming common to see 3D glasses being handed out every month or so; for those of us who have shared in the gimmick up until now, it's not exactly a promising sign, but it's a product of change we must accept nevertheless. Yet there are reasons as to why I always discuss the similarities between such features before going into details and that is simply because, like many other subgenres such as the ""J-horror"", the 3D movie usually sticks to traits which work as a deterrent to entertainment. Sure, the images are stark and glossy- they pop out at us and briefly take us aback, but then we slowly begin to realise that everything behind all this glitter is ironically flat. Of course, there have been rare exceptions to this general rule of thumb, and yet most seem to the stick to the same adage of your average 3D attraction at theme parks; distract first- tell a 'story' second.Then there's Bolt; Disney's latest animated feature touting anthropomorphised melodrama aimed at kids but not completely useless for adults. They're been doing it for a while now, but not necessarily in ""true 3D"". As a somewhat sophomoric experiment for Disney, one would expect Bolt to be hard pressed in finding its feet, and yet this is thankfully not the case. Instead, those guys from the Magic Kingdom have delivered a 3D experience that although suffering from many defects- at least doesn't pander to the technology that drives it. Indeed, rather than tell a story that feels weak and formulated for the sake of dazzling, Bolt dazzles through its characters and story which although comes off as tiresomely derivative and predictable at its worst moments, at least delivers on something other than cheap sparkle distractions. The result is a heart-warming experience that engages for the most part in a traditional manner whilst providing some awesome sequences for the eyeballs to chew up all the same. It certainly isn't perfect, no, but it's a fine effort nevertheless and a welcome eye opener to where the animated film industry may be headed.For all intents and purposes however, it 's certainly worth noting that while Bolt certainly does offer a breathtaking and very impressive tour de force of animation technology, the spectacle of the movie could still be just as effective in regular two-dimensional rendering. The movie's plot which centres around a brainwashed dog who goes astray in the real world only to find out he's not what he thought he was, is the first and foremost attraction to what is on offer here. Following a sweet, albeit overly familiar Buzz Lightyear complex of realizing your disillusions have been brought on by outside forces (here, they are represented by the special effects of Hollywood), Bolt tells a story that works on a literal and very touching, emotive manner for those less occupied with the intellect; granted, the pacing is irregular throughout act two which mostly follows a mundanely formulated animal-buddies-road-trip structure, but bookends one and three deliver many punches that never feel as cheap as those moments within the middle. Most importantly however, children will love it; it's sweet, funny, thrilling, slapstick and emotionally rewarding.For all the more reserved of viewers however, perhaps escorting the little ones to the cinema selflessly, Bolt isn't a misfire by any means. Sure, around half of the aforementioned qualities won't do much to invigorate the senses, yet the movie does well to work in a simple, albeit welcome allegory of disillusionment caused by the glitter and glare of TV screens, movies and celebrity magazines. In a sense I was taken aback when I was suddenly thinking about Fight Club in all its counterculture, frustration-and-disappointment-through-false-expectation thematic material, but pleased all the same. That's not to say that Bolt in any way starts overtly preaching or giving lessons on the crushing realities of life in the manner to which Fincher did ten years back; no, here the moral is closer to that of The Wizard of Oz than Jack's gloomy existentialist nightmare, yet it's this fine blend of intellectual substance loosely tying together a soft, sugary story that makes Bolt a much more rewarding experience than your average tepid animated fare.As previously mentioned, the aesthetics present here are wonderful; in fact, I feel no unease at claiming Bolt to be the best looking 3D animated film to date. Sure, it's a niche market at this point in time, but that doesn't detract from some of the movie's breathtakingly crisp action sequences that test the medium to its capabilities. The performers do a fine job too; it's nothing as remarkable as everything that surrounds them, but most do a fine job with what they are given and never succumb to the distant numbness sometimes associated with big stars playing polygon puppets.Conclusively I must reiterate that while Bolt does have its fair share of wonderful moments, a distinct lack of such during the movie's middle act inevitably hurts the momentum and overall impact of its greater parts. Nevertheless, those looking for a heart-driven tale filled with sweet characters, thrilling action and some genuinely laugh out loud gags, could certainly do a whole lot worse than taking a trip to catch Bolt. That being said, it's also a testament to the movie that I didn't grumble on and on about the evils of that often flat third dimension; Bolt showcases the idea that 3D can be more than a cheap gimmick to sell tickets. Instead it offers such technology as a well intended after-thought that only adds rather than detracts to the real reasons we as audiences sit down to watch movies in the first place.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"
46,Bolt,9,5 December 2008,A Nutshell Review: Bolt 3D,"To echo the biggest fan in the film, Bolt is fully Awesome! Or at least the 3D version of this film, especially the first 10 minutes where we see the superdog in action, showcasing super powers such as his eyes shooting laser beams, speedy acceleration, super strength, and his signature super bark. These are the avenues where 3D gets put to good use, but don't expect every aspect of the film to come flying toward you from the screen.Disney continues its fascination with the canines this year, having seen the likes of Beverly Hills Chihuahua, its collaboration with India in Roadside Romeo, and now, venturing into the 3D arena with Bolt the superdog. Man's best friend probably never had so much cinematic exposure in the same year, and 2008 ends off with an American Shepherd being the star of the show.Like The Truman Show, Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) is brought up as the unwitting star of a Hollywood television series, and is totally clueless to the world outside of its sound studio. Thinking that everything's for real, he becomes the perennial fish out of water, having been accidentally shipped from Hollywood to the Big Apple, and thinking that his person Penny (Miley Cyrus) is in mortal danger. Hence comes the road trip back to where he belongs, together with some serious questions asked in dealing with culture shock as he discovers his mortality and his being nothing but a normal mutt.Joining him in the adventures are a cynical cat Mittens (Susie Essman) who shovels the cruelties of the real world down Bolt's throat to awaken his idea, as well as a very zealous fanatical fan in hamster Rhino (Mark Walton). There's nothing groundbreaking here in its character development because it's tried and tested formula, as you'd come to expect everyone ironing out their initial differences to come through stronger as a combined unit than individuals out to fulfil their objectives - Bolt wants to return to his owner, Mittens just wants to rediscover love lost, and Rhino, well, is simply enjoying every minute spent in hanging around his idol.There are plenty of laughs coming from the initial half of the movie before Bolt's attempt to unlearn what he has learnt. The downside of course is that most of the funniest parts of the movie, already made it to the trailer. That aside, there's a very powerful message contained within for the young in reminding them not to abandon their pets, which is almost THE message that gets put into an animal-friendly/centric movie. Love and Friendship are the usual themes used through which to tug at your heartstrings, with enough moments to go ""aww"" and fight that tear or two in staining the 3D glasses which have to be returned. And of course with any dog movie, Loyalty is never far behind.For a few dollars more, you can choose to watch the 3D version of it, and trust me, it's worth every minute and every cent extra, even if there aren't many moments where you'll duck at objects flying towards you. It's quite obvious that unlike Journey to the Center of the Earth that the set action pieces here aren't designed explicitly for this format, but it still offers extremely good digital quality in the rendering of images that pop and provide you that extra dimension, so realistic that there will be moments where you'll be tempted to reach out and pseudo-pet the dog for a job well done. Visually, Bolt 3D is stunningly beautiful with wonderfully designed characters, and photo-realism aside, it's Disney at its best in designing characters with visual and character appeal, that can translate easily to merchandising dollars.Bolt 3D lives up to its novelty, and will instantly become a fan favourite amongst the kids and adults alike. I can picture busy cash registers for Christmas already."
47,Bolt,8,3 December 2008,"""Bolt"" Is Movie To Bark About . . .","The new animated 3-D Walt Disney family flick ""Bolt"" is pretty doggone funny. Combine elements of the Arnold Schwarzenegger epic ""Last Action Hero"" (1993) with the dogs trekking across America in the 1963 Disney classic ""The Incredible Journey,"" and you'll have a fair idea about what this cute canine comedy delivers. ""Bolt"" is the first Disney animated feature produced by the Mouse House since Pixar genius John Lasseter of ""Toy Story"" fame assumed creative control. Like previous Lasseter movies, such as ""Cars,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" the animation in ""Bolt"" is something to bark about. The incomparable 3-D digital projection is what distinguishes this lighthearted flick. Meanwhile, ""Mulan"" co-scripters Byron Howard and Chris Williams, who teamed up to helm this hilarious hokum, drum up a lot of jokes about a deluded doggie who dreams that he possesses super heroic powers. ""Pulp Fiction"" star John Travolta furnishes the voice for the feisty German shepherd puppy, and Disney singing sensation Miley Cyrus voices Penny, the teenager who adores Bolt at first sight when she spots the little nipper at an animal shelter.The premise of ""Bolt"" is as fetching as it is far-fetched. Boltcomplete with a jagged lightning insignia across his ribsbecomes the top dog of a prime-time, Google Generation, sci-fi TV show. The contemporary equivalent of Lassie, our four-pawed protagonist shows no fear in a crisis. In the context of the show, Penny desperately searches for her father who has been abducted by an evil Bond-type villain, Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell of ""A Clockwork Orange""), flanked by two haughty cats. Before Penny's poppa got kidnapped, he enhanced Bolt with cybernetic powers that make this man's best friend as powerful as Will Smith's ""Hancock."" Bolt's prime directive is to protect his 'person,' Penny (Miley Cyrus of ""Hannah Montana""), from Dr. Calico's black-clad henchmen. Bolt is so strong that he can smash head-first into a car and send it spinning end-over-end 50 yards in the air. He can turn eyes into molten lasers and burn through anything. Furthermore, he can hightail it down a street faster than a greyhound on afterburners and leap above a hovering helicopter's whirling rotor blades! In reality, however, Bolt is nothing more than an average bow-wow. Network TV executives have fooled our hero into thinking that he has cybernetically enhanced brawn. After Bolt has dealt with the villains and gone back to his trailer, the technicians step in and remove the debris. The dead and the wounded get up and brush themselves off. Network executives refuse to let Bolt out of his trailer for fear that he will discover the truth about himself. Nothing Bolt does is real; it's the result of carefully staged special effects. You can see the resemblance between Bolt and the ""Toy Story"" character Buzz Lightyear. Everything changes radically for Bolt when two sarcastic cats lure him out of his trailer. During a frantic chase, Bolt traps himself accidentally in a box of pink Styrofoam that is shipped off to New York City. In the Big Apple, three moronic pigeons lead Bolt to a cynical, declawed, black alley cat, Mittens (Susie Essman of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""), and our deluded hero takes her hostage so that he can find Penny. Leashed together like Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier were in the 1958 civil rights thriller ""The Defiant Ones,"" Bolt drags a reluctant Mittens across America to Hollywood. Along the way, Bolt realizes that he is an ordinary mutt. He succumbs to hunger pangs and begs for scraps at an RV park in Ohio. Infinitely wiser than Bolt, Mittens helps the whelp make his transition from super dog to normal hound.At the Ohio RV park, Bolt and Mittens encounter Rhino. Rhino (voiced by Mark Walton of ""Chicken Little"") is an energetic hamster who rolls around in a transparent plastic exercise ball. His favorite pastime is watching TV with his sphere balanced on the remote control so he can channel surf. The clueless Rhino worships Bolt as the super hero of his dreams and accompanies Mittens and Bolt to Las Vegas where they dine off left over casino buffet food in dumpsters. Along the way, Bolt discovers the simple pleasures of riding with his head stuck out a window of a moving vehicle, his ears sailing in the breeze, with his tongue trailing from the corner of his muzzle like a pennant. Just as Bolt is ready to surrender to the brutal, harsh grind of everyday life, Rhino refuses to let his hero sink into self-pity. Actually, this highly strung little hamster steals the show once he joins them, especially in a scene where Bolt and he rescue Mittens from an animal pound.The biggest problem with ""Bolt"" is its anticlimactic plot. Nothing after the electrifying first scene can match Bolt's clash with Dr. Calico's attack choppers and the phantom motorcyclists that blast away with missiles at our genetically-altered hero. The finale at the studio where Bolt finds that he has been replaced by a doggie double is particularly heartbreaking, but co-directors Howard and Williams don't let us down. The animators do a splendid job of replicating Travolta's facial expressions on the snout of the heroic canine and Travolta reads his lines with admirable restraint. Children should enjoy the antics of these talking animals, and the fantastic 3-D digital projection will knock the eyes out of the adults who are worried about surviving this 81-minute comedy without reward. Watching ""Bolt"" in any format other than 3-D is a waste of time."
48,Bolt,9,1 December 2008,Much better than I anticipated,"My local paper thought the movie was mediocre, but good kids entertainment. I would have to disagree. I thought it was much better than mediocre - by a long shot. And my son loved it, too.While the movie was predictable for the most part, the action sequences were as good as anything in the Incredibles (though perhaps a little more fantastic), and the story had some heart in places. The interaction between Bolt and his com-padres was a bit under-developed, but it worked for the most part.Parts of the movie are very funny, and some of the bit characters (including the pigeons) are well sketched and a riot. They definitely show the touch or philosophy of John Lasseter.The 3D aspect is cool and great for the action sequences, but the glasses are always a hassle."
49,Bolt,8,30 November 2008,Who knew this average dog could be such a superhero.,"When I first heard about this movie I wondered how they were going to pull off the fact that Bolt believed he was an actual superhero and I must say it was very convincing. I loved every minute of this movie, it had me laughing from beginning to end.I warmed up to Bolt from the beginning, not to mention Penny, I truly believed her dog was more that a superhero, but a best friend 'man's best friend'. I also warmed up to Mittens the cat and Rhino the 'crazed fan- sidekick and friend' of Bolt.I noticed that among the animals you were able to hear them speaking and when it came to actual people, the animals went back to their original tongues. It made me wonder whether or not animals have their own tongue that only they understand and we only hear 'roofs and meows', but the writing was well executed, even the little details made a big difference.The storyline was believable and well-done.I loved how the pigeons pledged war on the cat, I really believed Mittens was like the Mob-cat boss in their town. It was cool to see Bolt soften her a bit. Still at one point I thought they were going to give Bolt and Mittens a love story-Cat dog, I admired their love-hate relationship though.""I have a sponge"" Blot's weakness, classic.The pigeons Mittens easily bullied certainly got their revenge. I loved that. Everything remained in character, like when the dog began sniffing Bolt's butt. I understood, Bolt wasn't really exposed to that kind of behavior, but that dog was just too funny.""I'm sorry do you want to sniff mine first"" Some things were a bit far fetched, like Bolt not ever bleeding in his lifetime, until he actually ventured out into the wild. Somethings weren't explained, like Bolt's ability to move in lightening speed and jump over the helicopter, without a scratch. Still that didn't take away from the amazing delivery of this movie which only made you sit-back and enjoy every bit. I loved how they explained his super strength and Bolt's naivety about his superpowers 'The dog has to believe it'. The laser eyes were also well-explained and very humorous.Rhino was also a catch, what's a story if you don't have that one thing that is your supporting hand,in this case 'paw' and Rhino was it for Bolt. Rhino didn't come off cheesy at all, his owner was the typical stay at home grandma who tuned into every show including the commercials, of course the hamster would turn out an obsessed television fan. Bolt, what a way to give animals hope.My favorite scene was the pigeons that acted like even more crazed fans when Bolt was in Hollywood.They even offered advice for the series.""Wait for it.. wait for it... Aliens"" Then again who better to watch television all day but a bunch of pigeons flying by the local television sets, on your window.I hope they make more Like this one, I really enjoyed it."
50,Bolt,10,30 November 2008,I have _always_ preferred Happy Endings.  Even when _I_ was an 18-35-year-old!,"And, BOLT continues to preserve that sacred Disney tradition.The dog of the title is a white German Shepherd puppy who's been raised to believe that he truly is a super-powered canine crime-fighter. But, through a certain string of circumstances, he is separated from his child-star owner Penny. Forcing him to team up with cynical, streetwise alley cat Mittens and hero-worshipping hamster Rhino in order to re-unite with her.This film has something for everybody. The younger kids will love it for three reasons. The sweet sub-plot of a naive, overly-sheltered pet making new (animal) friends. Plus, the comedy relief supplied by regionally different pigeons. And, of course, Bolt trying to perform in real-life the stunts he does on his show...and failing (""It must be the Styrofoam!"").Grown-ups and older kids, meanwhile, will love it for the semi-good-natured way the movie pokes well-deserved fun at the business side of show business. Especially, as personified by that obnoxious agent/manager!In short, folks: if you want an unhappy ending? Watch the first five minutes of the 6PM news. If you want the polar opposite? Go see this film, completely guilt-free. You'll love it. No matter what your age-demographic!"
51,Bolt,8,30 November 2008,"A Doggy ""Don Quixote""","It's been a long time since I've wanted to see a Disney movie that didn't have Pixar or Hayao Miyazaki attached to it. For whatever reason, the past several films Disney has made by themselves have failed to live up to the standard of classics like SNOW WHITE, PINNOCHIO, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and THE LION KING, to name a few. Only time will tell if BOLT will be lucky of enough to held anywhere near the regard those movies are, but it's certainly a step in the right direction.I'll go ahead and admit it's nothing that hasn't been done before (just once can't we have talking animal movie that doesn't involved a journey of some kind where the characters learn things about themselves and some life lessons?), but it has so much humor and heart that makes up for it's clichés.The movie sure starts out good enough, with little Penny getting Bolt, a frisky and active puppy, from a pet store in a scene I thought was kinda sweet. Then we flash forward 5 years later to the action parts. As you probably know by now, Bolt is the star of his own action/science fiction TV show, where he uses super powers to regularly save Penny from the henchmen of the evil Dr. Calico. The tone setting scene for the show is like an entertaining cross between Lassie, James Bond and a little of the Matrix Trio (only better). Only Bolt doesn't know it's fake, as the studio does what they can to make him think he really is a super dog in order for him to give a better performance. The situation is made a little worse because Calico's cat (who's in on the sham) taunts him nightly for fun. There's also the fact that he and Penny really care for each other, having a relationship I found fairly touching and doubt most Timmies and Lassies ever had.One day, the show ends shooting with a cliffhanger and Bolt escapes his trailer to rescue Penny only to end up in a box that's shipped from Hollywood to New York. With the ""advice"" of some pigeons, he takes a stray cat named Mittens hostage and forces her to help him get back to Hollywood & Penny and along the way they get help from a hamster named Rhino, who's a fan of the show.The movie is helped by a colorful cast of characters. Bolt is the canine version of Buzz Lightyear or Don Quixote, completely deluded into thinking his powers are real. Seeing him talk old fashioned heroic dialogue at the beginning of the movie bought a smile to my face, and then when he starts doubting his powers and finds out they aren't real, it brings some depth & pathos to his character. Mittens makes the perfect straight man to him early on, street wise and sarcastic, then helps him learn to act like a real dog. And then we learn something about her past that makes us feel some sympathy for her. Rhino is as delusional, if not more so, than his hero, and could be the kind of pudgy, excitable fan boy one encounters in real life at various convention. And Penny is a likable girl who truly cares for Bolt and is even forced to make some hard decisions about her feelings for him. And there's a good supporting cast, from the pigeons to Dr. Calico to his cats to Penny's Agent, who keep things lively. And it's made even better by the great voice acting of the cast.I'd like to talk about the great animation, but enough people have done that and all I'll say is that the animals, especially the pigeons, move like their real life counterparts.There are some pretty funny jokes here. Almost everything with Rhino and the pigeons will get some laughs. The pigeons are made funnier because different groups of three are encountered who have the same character design, but have different color schemes and accents. And for a while Bolt thinks his powers were taken away by the Styrofoam packing peanuts in the box he was shipped in and we get a clever running gag about Styrofoam being his kryptonite.My biggest gripe was said before, as we've seen the story before. And there are times in the middle it drags just a bit. And near the end, things got a little hokey for me.However, this is still the best non-Pixar movie Disney has made in years as far as I'm concerned. If they can keep it up, they can get back on the right track to being the kings of animations again."
52,Bolt,3,8 January 2013,Different movies bolted into one,"This is three entirely different movies bolted into one. The extended opening sequence shows Bolt as the superhero in a sci-fi TV action programme, with lots of shooting, explosions, creepy characters and military hardware, and is far too scary and aggressive for young children.Then there's an extended Bolt-in-Hollywood section, with lots of nods to the adults, in which virtually everyone is cynical and extremely unsympathetic, while Bolt with his delusional pumped-up ego also was hard to warm to. The (in-)jokes simply weren't funny, and everything left such a sour taste in the mouth that I switched the movie off after 38 minutes... my two kids (10 and 7) didn't protest, which says something.I later watched the rest alone to be able give this movie a fair review, and discovered the lengthy cute though also rather predictable middle section, which is suitable for younger kids, but probably would bore the over 10s. The end section is a kind of Frankenstein attempt to bolt all elements together, and in doing so tries to be all things to all people, and rather predictably failed. The movie is beautifully drawn, but the story simply does not hold together, and only the hamster provided some laughs.Finally, is it just me or is an obsession with military hardware and uniforms and violence beginning to creep into all American children's' movies? The relentless exposure of kids (and adults) to military-style footage, costumes, weapons, communication, language, action, etc implicitly legitimises war. IMDb's Parents Guide section, with its endless lists of ""facts"" without providing any context, also has has become totally useless in warning us which kids' movies glorify the military and violence, and which don't. ""Arthur Christmas"" is another example: no warning whatsoever that Santa's exploits are presented like a military operation, complete with flak jackets and the lot."
53,Bolt,8,17 December 2008,A truly memorable affair,"The animated movie scene is on a roll this year. It started with Dreamworks' Kung Fu Panda, then with the joyous Pixar gem Wall-E and now, with Walt Disney's heartfelt treat, Bolt. This movie is just fun from the minute it starts until it ends and they didn't forget to put in some heart which then makes some lasting impression to the audience. You will laugh at Rhino the hamster's overeager attitude and snappy dialogues, Mittens the cat and the pigeons were great comic relief but the star of the show Bolt, is the one who truly shines. He's just too darn cute in his Truman Show world, they gave him a distinct memorable character and John Travolta's voice work gave it life. Bolt's person, Penny who is voiced by tween popstar Miley Cyrus fit the character well. Seeing as this is her first time doing a gig like this, I can say she got the job done and very professional, I might add. As long as she's doing voice over gigs and gets second billing, that's fine by me.Ultimately, I think what made this movie really work is John Lasseter. The Pixar brainchild who transferred to Disney. He gave Bolt a touch of Pixar that we all know and love but still separates it from other animated movies and giving it a distinct trait that we all knew and love in Disney classics like Snow White and Cinderella. All in all, Bolt is one of 2008's must-see movies, trust me, you wouldn't want to miss it for the world."
54,Bolt,6,24 November 2008,Was expecting more...,"I felt like Bolt was a wonderful children's movie, but left nothing for adults to be entertained by. I didn't think the one-liners were very witty, nor did I think the story idea was very original. I like the idea that Bolt didn't know he wasn't a super hero, but after that idea I didn't seem to find anything original in the rest of the film. COME ON Disney! GIVE US SOMETHING NEW!!!!! They should have put more humor for the adults that are the majority of the audience for the film. The graphics were well done, but I felt since it was in 3-D there should have been at least A FEW places where things really POPPED out at you, there were ample opportunities for this too considering Bolt's action TV sets etc."
55,Bolt,9,25 January 2015,A Fantastic Animated Film that Will Appeal to Adults,"Last night I watched Disney's ""Bolt"" animated feature from 2008. I knew very little about the movie going into it, and I imagined that since I had heard less about ""Bolt"" than I had about some of the other animated features in recent years (""Brave""; ""Big Hero 6""; etc.) that perhaps the movie would be a flop. I must say that I found myself pleasantly surprised with the film, and it made such a good impression on me that I've given it 9/10 stars.The movie follows the story of a dog named ""Bolt"" who happens to be a television star in Hollywood. Bolt's adventure takes him across the country before working his way back to Hollywood where he's trying to reunite with his ""person"" (i.e. owner), Penny. Bolt is voiced by John Travolta and Penny is voiced by Miley Cyrus, both of whom do great jobs in this movie.If I had any one word of criticism for ""Bolt"", it would be the way in which the film portrays the dog as a movie star and shows behind the scenes footage of his career. For example, you see producers and agents talking with the show's cast, and you see graphics people working at computers to edit the show for production. For me, there was a bit of an uncomfortable vibe there, inasmuch as the way that it's done takes away from the magic of the movie a bit. I felt bad for kids in the audience, many of whom might be seeing a movie for the first time, and who were seeing that movies and TV shows in general are all sort of fake. That in and of itself takes away from the film a bit, but then you throw in the fact that the way in which it was handled might be a bit hard for some younger children to really ""get"", and that raises questions as to whether or not the script for this movie was very well thought out. But, no sooner than I say that, I have to admit that if you can get past the whole ""behind the scenes"" thing that is featured in the movie and just take it for what it is, the film itself is outstanding. This is why I say that the movie will appeal to adults just as much as it does older kids who won't have a problem comprehending the behind-the-scenes technique. Once you're able to forget about whether or not your four year old is going to understand what's happening on the screen and enjoy the movie just for yourself, you'll probably really enjoy this movie.Last but not least, I'd just quickly remark about how amazing the CGI effects are in this film. That's nothing out of the ordinary for computer animation these days, with lots of other movies using similar techniques to offer up stunning computer generated visuals in feature films, i.e. ""Shrek"", ""Monsters Inc."", ""Toy Story"" and the like. But as someone who has only seen a handful of those movies that are becoming more and more plentiful, ""Bolt"" reminded me of what a fantastic age we live in in which animation can be so incredibly sharp, detailed and defined.All that said, if you're watching this movie as an adult or if your child is old enough to understand the somewhat awkward behind-the-scenes technique of the script of this film, then I imagine that you'll find yourself loving ""Bolt"". It's a neat film with great graphics and an engaging story that you may enjoy as much if not more so than your kids."
56,Bolt,10,31 December 2014,Character Development done PERFECTLY!,"This movie's plot is one of the most creative Disney came up with yet! However, It's the characters that really sold me on this movie! Every one of the main characters are fleshed out and believable despite being talking animals! The most striking is Bolt's realization that his world is a TV show! It also shows how disposable and replaceable actors and actresses are when corporations are involved! Bolt and Penny being effortlessly replaced when they choose to go back to a normal life. It was also interesting how grounded everything was in reality despite the premise. People can't understand the animals, but the animals can understand the humans to great degree. Overall, it was definitely worth the buy! Despite being a kid's movie, the plot wasn't dumbed down, and it was enjoyable for adults and kids alike!"
57,Bolt,9,12 October 2014,hilarious,"This was a great Disney animated comedy, and adults and kids will love it equally. It features a dog who's the star of a TV show that features him as a ""superhero dog"" who has a super bark, can melt metal with his eyes, and do a lot of other things. The problem is, this is the only world he's ever known, and when he accidentally gets shipped off in a crate cross-country, he thinks his powers are real and doesn't know how to function in the so-called ""real world."" He gets teamed up with a cat and hamster in his quest to reunite with his ""person,"" Penny, and hilarious situations abound as he tries to enact his ""superpowers."" As you can imagine, towards the end, I won't reveal it, but he does wind up in a situation where he has to be the ""hero."" There are also situations I've seen in films like this.Overall, this was a funny and good movie with a great voice cast, including John Travolta as Bolt. Any fan of animated films will love this.*** out of ****"
58,Bolt,10,1 September 2014,"A fast-paced, well-directed animated feature.","I love ""Bolt"" because of its story and how it tells it. ""Bolt"" echoes ""The Truman Show"" but asks what would happen if Truman secretly escaped. Bolt has been basically lied to his whole life and led to believe he was some kind of messiah sent to protect millions but finds his whole life is a joke for a low-rated television show. Even the event that leads him on his adventure was just a way to get higher ratings. His first interactions with real world are frightening, funny, and cute which is the point. The Director of Bolt's show succeeds in creating a character that would totally embrace the fake world around him, yet he fails to create a character with an identity outside of his fake world.After Bolt escapes, there's really no villain. There're only unfortunate events. That's another thing that makes Bolt work: there's no one that the viewer can point to and say that's the bad guy. Sure, there are jerks, but no one is really a villain. The viewer can't blame the Director for creating Bolt; after all, the Director just wanted to make the show as believable as possible. He didn't want Bolt to get hurt, yet he wanted perfection. After getting perfection, people got hurt.The movie isn't about grand villains; it's about figuring out what life is like without grand villains."
59,Bolt,10,12 June 2013,Bolt for president!,"Oh Bolt! How I love you! This is by far one of my top favorite animated movies of all time, and I'm not even a John Travolta fan! My favorite thing about this movie is the opening. If you watch this with someone who doesn't know what is going to happen, the opening credits are fun to watch them be surprised by. I love a good twist! I thought John did a fantastic job (probably because I didn't have to look at his actual face, which was really only good for Grease) and even Miley didn't annoy me the way she usually does. The hamster was a fantastic addition and is pretty much everyone's favorite character. The pigeons were so well animated I was keeled over laughing from how life-like they were and their New York accents just made it that much better! I won't sum up the plot because if you haven't seen it and don't know what to expect from it, there is nothing I can say that won't give the opening credits surprise away and since that is my favorite part about it I refuse to ruin that for anyone. Great for kids, great for teens, great for adults. This is true Disney gold! 10/10! I would give it a 20/10 if I could!"
60,Bolt,7,30 January 2012,Disney Bolt's back into action!,"Bolt is a light-hearted family movie, which provides entertainment and shows how a dog cannot do without 'it's person.' The story centres around Bolt, a white German Sheppard, who has spent his entire life on a set of a television show, in which he portrays a 'superdog.' As a result he believes that all the events that happen around him are real. When he is accidentally shipped from his home in Hollywood to New York City, he embarks on a cross-country journey so that he can be reunited with his owner and co-star, Penny. Bolt soon finds himself with two companions, alley cat Mittens, and a TV obsessed hamster Rhino.The characters throughout are engaging and easy to enjoy and relate to. The effects in this movie are well executed, so much so that everything in the movie looks so realistic, yet does not contradict with the fact that it is actually an animation.Even though the story is centred around Bolt, it is hard not to mention the two unlikely accomplice's Mittens and Rhino, who to me somehow steal the show. Not only are they both entertaining with their witty comments and sarcasm, but at the end of the day they are very endearing. And it is a Disney film, so it's nice to see them all have a happy ending, as an extended family together.It is hard not to make comparisons after watching Bolt. A superhero who suddenly finds himself in the real world and must accept the heart-breaking fact that there is nothing special about them; I don't know about you but all I can think about is Buzz in Toy Story.As with all classic Disney films, there is an underlying positive message to give to all. In Bolt's case the message is be true to oneself and find your own inner hero. But in a completely different direction this is like Disney's version of The Trueman Show. Watch and you will see."
61,Bolt,10,28 May 2011,"Brilliant, Funny, Heart Rending","Disguised as a ""family"" film (aka ""kiddie""), this is a great comedy-adventure with a lot of depth and truth to it. You can take ""the kids"" to it, but you don't need a kid as an excuse to see this film. It's laugh-out-loud funny and cleverly written for an adult sense of humor. It has a couple of tear-jerking moments about lost love and abandoned pets, but it isn't maudlin or belabored. This would make a great date movie rental. If your date doesn't laugh or shed a tear throughout the entire movie, dump them FAST! They might be a sociopath. Other than Travolta and Miley Cyrus, there are few big names in the cast, though a few gems such as Malcolm McDowell (""A Clockwork Orange"", etc.) and cartoon stalwarts such as Phil Lamar, but the acting is flawless, demonstrating the wealth of talent in ""voice acting"". I have no idea how well this movie works in other languages, but in English, it's a must-see."
62,Bolt,7,13 February 2011,Lassie has a Truman show's syndrome,"Bolt is Walt-Disney animation feature that tells the adventures of Bolt, a dog actor, and his quest to find his master after a series of events brings him to the other part of the USA.The story uses well-known traditional stories, a dog going back to his owner after traveling hundreds of miles, and the story of a character that believes the world that surrounds him is real and not built to make him believe so. In fact, you find the same elements in the old classic Lassie, and in the modern classic The Truman's Show. In that regard, Bolt is a revamped Lassie with a Truman's syndrome. These elements are well mixed and twisted to create an original, enjoyable and humorous adventure of love, faith, and identity.I found the first minutes, with puppy Bolt adorable. Then, I was quite irritated with the first minutes of the action movie, until the original story starts. So, if you don't feel appealed by the James-Bond-ish persecution, just wait a few minutes and give the movie a chance.The characters are very likable, especially Rhino the overweight excitable hamster, masterfully voiced by Mark Walton, the mater-of-fact but helpful cat Mittens, voiced by Susie Essman, and the several groups of pigeons that appear in the movie, which I found hilarious. Bolt's sweet confused character is voiced by an almost unrecognizable John Travolta, while sweet Penny is voiced by another unrecognizable Miley Cyrus. In fact, all the dubbing is terrific.The animation is very good, especially the gorgeous mate-painting backgrounds, which portrait with accuracy and lyricism the diversity of the USA's landscapes, and make the trip through the country real and believable. Some of the details of the vegetation are just amazing, as well the landscaping layout, house architecture, the colors, and a magnificent lighting. The drawing of the leading characters is just OK, a little bit chunky and lacking in detail and limited movement for both Bolt and Mittens. However, the ensemble is very good, and the dubbing helps tremendously to make the characters come to life.An lovely family film with great animation, entertaining plot, characters and soundtrack"
63,Bolt,8,30 August 2010,"Enjoyable, Engaging, Heart-warming, Funny, Exciting and Recommended.","I wasn't sure I would like this one when I saw it on the TV schedule. I seem to remember it not doing all that well at the box-office when it was released. I shouldn't have worried; it has all the best bits that go into a Disney animation plus a heart-warming story to boot! But more of that later, here's a bit about the plot first.Bolt is a dog, not just an ordinary dog, he's a dog with superpowers! Penny, his human, and her father put him in a device that enabled him to run like the wind, be as stronger than a speeding truck, jump further than anyone, gave him laser vision and a super-bark that will destroy anything in its path. Each day, he saves Penny and they go back to the safety of his trailer, but one day she is taken by the evil Dr. Calico and Bolt is left alone in the trailer. Determined to find Penny he escapes into the real world, a world where his powers no longer work. He finds a cat, Mittens who, he believes, knows the whereabouts of Dr. Calico's lair. She eventually tells him it is in Hollywood, a long way from their current location, New York. And so, taking Mittens with him as insurance, Bolt begins a journey that will change his life. On the way they bump into his number-one fan, a hamster called Rhino. But that's all I'm going to say about the plot, don't want to give too much away now.A really well animated film, in the Pixar style as I like to call it. Some great gags and some really engaging characters combine to make this an enjoyable experience. Good performances all round, so honourable mentions go to; John Travolta as Bolt, Smiley Virus (ok, Miley Cyrus) as Penny, Susie Essman as Mittens, Mark Walton as Rhino and Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Calico.Over all a really enjoyable movie with some great characters and some really good sight gags and one-liners. I wasn't so sure about the music but then I'm not a big country music fan. It was also nice to see dog and a cat getting on together in a Disney film for a change! It does happen in real life you know! (ok, minor rant over). So, enjoyable, engaging, heart-warming, funny, exciting and recommended.My score: 7.7/10"
64,Bolt,8,26 September 2009,Slight but very charming,"The plot concerns a dog (Bolt) who doesn't realize that his entire life is just a TV show. So, when he accidentally gets lost in the real world, he cannot understand why his super-powers have disappeared. And so, until he meets a wise and worldly cat, he flounders--unable to figure out how he got there or how to get back to the little girl he loves.This is not the deepest story I have ever seen for a computer animated movie, but it was quite charming and fun--something that many other family movies could emulate. In fact, compared to previous Disney-produced CGI movies (other than those from the separate Pixar unit), BOLT is a significant improvement--both in story and in animation quality. If you don't believe this, just try watching CHICKEN LITTLE some time--it lacks the charm and universal appeal of BOLT. In other words, CHICKEN LITTLE was purely for very little kids--adults would mostly be bored by the film. MEET THE ROBINSONS was a bit of an improvement, but with BOLT I could finally enjoy the movie along with my kids.Fun, well-animated and different. While not exactly a must-see, this is a very good film."
65,Bolt,7,3 August 2009,Electrically entertaining from Trabolta,"In Bolt, a TV-show canine (John Travolta), who doesn’t know he’s on a TV show and therefore has no super powers, races across the country to find his TV girl-owner (Miley Cyrus), convinced she’s in the clutches of the evil Dr. Calico, the bad guy on the show. Aided by a cynical alley cat and a hamster in a transportation ball, Bolt must fight the forces of gravity and the other laws of physics to be reunited with his Penny in this sweet, charming Disney animated film.It’s encouraging to see a good Disney-only animated film for a change. Bolt does what an animated movie should do – it has a quick pace, it’s humanistic, it’s funny, and it’s adventurous. Oh, and there’s character growth. It’s no surprise that the intended audience – little kids, not me – found this entertaining, on average.Bolt, an American White Shephard, escapes from his trailer on the set of his hit television series and finds himself shipped to the East Coast. Thinking that his Penny is in imminent danger from the man with the green eye (played with the usual maniacal glee of Malcom McDowell), Bolt tries to use his super powers – super speed, the ability to shoot lasers from his eyes, a Super Bark – to rescue her. Of course, since he’s just a normal dog, these super powers don’t work, but they do lead to some hilarious physical comedy.One departure this movie offers is the casting of unknowns in key roles. Mittens the Cat is played by Susie Essman, and the scene-stealing Rhino the Hamster is voiced by Mark Walton. Who and who? And yet both actors are perfect for the roles. Sometimes it pays to cast someone based purely on their fit for a character, rather than hiring a “name” actor and letting their celebrity overtake the character completely. Which is how Disney did it for years and years; when the studio enjoyed its resurgence in 1989 with The Litter Mermaid, it cast Buddy Hackett amid character actors, and the landscape of animation changed. Next thing you know, you had Robin Williams in Aladdin and James Earle Jones in The Lion King. Not that these were bad casting choices, but they represented a change from olden times, for the most part.Travolta is excellent as the intrepid, resilient, and initially deluded Bolt, a canine who learns that his super powers come from within him. Why, he had the power to save Penny all along! All he had to do was click his heart together, and.. Oh, never mind. The point is, Bolt learns that help can come from unlikely sources (a cat!), and comic relief is always welcome (a hamster!) And Cyrus – who has limited screen time, compared with Travolta – is spot on as the innocent Penny, who pines for her lost pup. In fact, if it weren’t for an extended musical montage (sung by Jenny Lewis), this would have been a great movie instead of merely a very good one, but you can’t please everyone."
66,Bolt,10,17 July 2009,Oddly - Gripping,"Lovely film. I'm odd as I'm 18 years old and still cry at movies like this. It's a touching piece of cinema. Bolt has tons of character, as does Mittins the cat. I actually hadn't heard of this film at all but gave it a shot anyway. And I'm glad I did.The story itself is brilliant, and brilliantly told too. Bolt - who thinks he has superpowers is lost and sent to New York, he finds out his superpowers were fake (all part of a TV show) and does a road trip back to Hollywood. I wasn't expecting the story to be so good.In terms of art style I wouldn't rank it too highly as it seems every animated film is capable of this type of stuff, but the points where the characters aren't talking still shine. Bolt is a hyperactive dog, and this is a hyperactive movie. It works well.The voice acting is superb. Unlike Madagascar, the voices fit with their characters, John Travolta does a superb job of Bolt and Susie Essman does a great job with mittens. They're subtle performances and don't stand out too much like they do in other animated films (aka Madagascar, where none of the voice actors are particularly good).There are a few points in this movie that are really funny. Namely the bits with Rhino and the Pidgeons. Again... All superb voices. The bits that are funny surpass the competition. Ice Age (2 and 3), for example, are no where near as funny or touching as this movie.The ending (no spoilers) is lovely. Well worth watching. Again and again. I'm off to find a BluRay copy!"
67,Bolt,10,25 June 2009,A super dog!!,"A super hero is unleashed in town. No it is not Batman, Spiderman or Wolverine; it is Bolt  a new canine creation from the house of Walt Disney. This movie is a treat for all the dog lovers. ""Dog is a Man's best friend"" has been aptly shown in this 3-D animated movie Bolt. It stars big names like John Travolta (voice for Bolt) and Miley Cyrus (voice for Penny). Like every other Disney movie this movie too scores high in its animation of course, awesome story line, cute humour and endearing characters.The dog (an American White Shepherd) in the movie is made to believe that he has super powers and his aim is to save his person 'Penny' from the green eyed evil Dr. Calico. But destiny had some other plans and Bolt escapes from his reel world in search of Penny who according to him has been kidnapped by Dr. Calico. In his quest to save Penny he meets an alley cat Mittens (voice given by Susie Essman) who loves to bully the pigeons and Bolt's ardent fan Rhino (voice given by Mark Walton), who by the way is a hamster.The camaraderie between the three is splendid and absolutely fun to watch. Mittens like a good friend gives realty check to Bolt and Rhino with his zealous spirit makes Bolt believe that nothing his impossible and always cheer him up. Don't miss watching the pigeons. They are quick, intelligent and enterprising. I loved the performance of Rhino. He was simply awesome, no actually beyond awesome, he was beawesome!! All in all, Bolt is a great movie of courage, loyalty, friendship and the power of love. The message is positive and the hero comes out on top. Great family movie!"
68,Bolt,10,19 May 2009,No doubt a choice for a family night movie,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Disney movies and 3D animation. The movie is fun, beautifully animated, and funny. Voices of the characters are very good, especially John Travolta, since I didn't realize it until mid in the movie since it fits the character so perfectly. The most important lesson of the movie teaches kids that you don't necessarily need to be a super hero or have special abilities, fly or shoot laser to help others. You simply can be a friend's, or the family's hero by just being there for them in the time of need and help and support them to the best of your ability. I would definitely Recommend this movie for any family movie night or any one that is the fan of Disney movies."
69,Bolt,10,26 April 2009,Smitten with Mittens...,"Just one of the unfortunate consequences of so many home foreclosures over the past couple of years in this country has been the abandonment of household pets. It's not a happy story, nor one that gets a whole lot of coverage. (It happens to have happened to my sister.) For a Disney film to even touch upon this subject is surprising (LADY AND THE TRAMP notwithstanding)- and commendable. My favorite of The Three Mouseketeers is, of course, the streetwise Mittens: her sad little tale of woe, blurted suddenly in a moment of emotional vulnerability, is enough to make this one of the more memorable animated features of the past several decades, and it gives the movie its considerable Emotional Impact. I honestly don't remember the last time I choked up watching a cartoon cat spill its emotional guts. A tip of the hat to all involved: you blew ME away, anyway."
70,Bolt,10,19 April 2009,This Movie is True Disney,"After all the complaints on the ""new"" Disney, this movie truly shows how exhilarating yet breathtaking and beautiful Walt Disney intended his films to be.Many think this movie may look bad, but for it coming out on my birthday and it being the best movie EVER, It's a tearjerker that I'm going to see again.Many parts of the movie look cheesy, and stupid, but you just need to understand them, that's all. See the movie and they become heartfelt and funny.So get your tissues and plop on the couch and get ready for the best animated experience you've ever had!"
71,Bolt,9,4 April 2009,Surprisingly good!,"When I saw the previews for Bolt I wasn't expecting much. Your typical kid's film, really. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Bolt and recommend this film to others.The voice acting was very well done. Mark Walton, the voice of Rhino, really stole the show here. I was a bit disappointed that they used Miley Cyrus for Penny because it seemed like a cheap advertising gimmick but she did a half-decent job.The animation was superb. The action scene and the very beginning of the film is very well done and the rest of the film is a treat for the eyes as well.I loved the characters, and although the plot was predictable and not very original the lovable and funny characters made up for it. I rarely laugh at movies but Rhino the hamster made me chuckle many times.Overall I recommend Bolt to anyone expecting a fun movie. It's not up to par with many previous animated movies but regardless it's still very entertaining, even if you don't like kid's movies."
72,Bolt,10,1 April 2009,"Great, Great Movie","I loved it and I have no kids! Whoever wrote this movie really cares about animals, the cat is very real and a true voice of reason. The cat was my favorite from her voice to her lessons. Anyone who doesn't like this movie, I'm sure must have gotten offended by the cats comments about fickle people de-clawing their cats and then abandoning them. People who do that make me sick. There is never an excuse to get rid of a cat you have selfishly de-clawed. The characters are fantastic and the casting was flawless. This movie has the perfect mix of Disney magic and reality! I would think this movie would teach a child loyalty and faithfulness, truly an all around classic."
73,Bolt,7,23 January 2009,Amusing ....,"Finally ... a funny animation movie this year ... i was losing hope to find something valuable and worth watching and this one was my paid .... It's all about a little dog which found itself a big hero destroying cars killing the bad ones to protect it's person ... he got lost in a big van so he met the cat and got into a great adventure , but suddenly Bolt discovers that he isn't the great super dog and it's just the painful reality ... at last he saves his person and a happy ending for all , I want to say that 7/10 for an animation movie is a very good mark so this is what i will rate Bolt with ... Bolt is a great and funny film so , even if you are not a big fan to the animation world you won't regret it at all ."
74,Bolt,,5 June 2016,Pixa- I mean Disney at its finest,"Lets face it, the early 00s were not kind on Disney. The Renaissance was over, their loyal target audience was in college and thus not interested, Pixar was doing the whole CGI thing way better than them and all in all they seemed to have lost their touch. Until this film. Oh sure, it's still very much like something Pixar would have done and a bit missing on that Disney magic, but it's still a very good film that allowed them to get back on their feet.And when I say it's something Pixar would have done, I mean that in a good way. Kind of. The plot features a dog, raised to believe he has genuine superpowers, suddenly being separated from his loyal owner Penny and now having to make his way back across USA to reunite with her. All the while having to learn that the world does not in fact play by his rules. Sounds like a Pixar movie, doesn't it. But then again, Pixar is a great film studio so that's not exactly an insult.And the story and the characters are very good in their own right. Bolt, the eponymous main character, is very gruff and no-nonsense, but also delightfully naïve about the realities of the world, while Mittens, his new cat sidekick/helper/kidnap victim is pretty much the exact opposite. And then there is Rhino, a hamster trapped in a plastic ball and also one of Bolt's biggest fans. Rhino is awesome.And yeah, it's kind of silly that I keep complaining about the fact that it's so much a Pixar film. It does make it seem a bit artificial in a way, because you know that they're copying much of their good material. But it's a good film, when all is said and done. Do see it, if you have the chance, is what I'm saying."
75,Bolt,7,11 February 2009,Good but not great,"This CGI animated movie from Disney/Pixar (under John Lasseter's aegis within the new arrangements, but not actually initiated by Pixar) illustrates how far CGI has come. Character design, backgrounds, and animation are all of a standard which would have been drooled over a few short years ago - now they are simply taken for granted.The story concerns the efforts of Bolt (a dog who stars on TV as a superhero, and believes that his TV show is real) to travel across the USA in order to be reunited with Penny, his human. His companions are Mittens, a cat with a jaundiced attitude, and Rhino, a hamster (complete with transparent ball) who has had a great deal of exposure to TV.The movie is good, though it should be noted that there may not be quite as much for adults as there often is in these movies.Of more interest is the 3D. Technically, it is perfect - there is no ghosting across of right eye image to left eye or vice versa - each image is absolutely discretely delivered to its own eye. I'm pleased to report that the film is not filled with things being jabbed into the camera constantly - sure, it happens once or twice, but not enough to distract - instead, the 3D is for the most part simply quite natural. In fact, the thing which impressed me most was Rhino's globe - the distortion of the background through the plastic makes the globe the most believable thing in screen in the entire film.And I suppose, in five years' time, we'll be taking the quality of the 3D for granted, too."
76,Bolt,9,15 December 2008,The BEST action adventure movie for kids in a long...long...time.,"Bolt (voiced by the talented John Travolta) is a pooch that was found by his person, Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) and was altered by Penny's father (voiced by Ronn Moss) into an ultimate and indestructible canine partner. He's strong. He's fast. And he has Super Bark. That and the fact that he doesn't know that he is in a TV show and that he is the most convincing animal actor ever, since he's not in on the whole scheme.One day, after a demand from the studio that the director make a more thrilling and suspenseful storyline (a.k.a. cliff-hanger ending), Bolt breaks out of the studio, trying to find Penny, whom he thinks is really kidnapped by the evil Dr Calico (Malcolm McDowell), who really doesn't exist. Being swooped away from his former life, he now has to make his way home (the studio). Easy enough, except the fact that his power is now disappearing...at least that's what he thinks. We get to see him finds his way home, while making friends along the way.This is the BEST action adventure kids' movie I've seen in a long time. And to think that Disney did it alone (without the help of Pixar) is very overwhelming. Although not nearly as good as Wall-E, Bolt does deliver, it has energy, the story develops nicely and in the end, it's a very fun movie.It's pretty much like The Truman Show, except Truman accidentally got out, and THEN found out that the world in which he used to live in wasn't real.The vocal cast is very impressive. Travolta sounds very young and quite the hero he portrays. Cyrus did the best she could with her character, which is not in on the action for most of the movie. But what really DELIVER the movie are the supporting casts. Mark Walton is the one that stands out, voicing the deranged and slightly mental hamster, named Rhino, who is also the biggest fan of Bolt. He is everything you see in the trailer and more. He's funny, loud, and wants to be in the action (being Bolt's #1 fan and all), and he keeps blurting out crazy and funny quotes. He introduces himself to Bolt by saying, ""I'm lightning quick; I have razor-sharp reflexes. And I'm a master of stealth."" Funny considering he's a fat, round hamster who does nothing all day but watch TV. And when he sees a guard at the animal shelter, he quotes, ""I'll snap his neck."" The cat Mittens (Susie Essman) spends the entire movie trying to convince Bolt that he's not a superhero and that it's okay to be ordinary. This is a good lesson for the kids.Finally, does this movie bring anything new to the animated world? Perhaps not. But considering it wasn't made by the giant company like Pixar, it's quite an achievement. This is what I want from Disney in a long time. Well done!"
77,Bolt,4,28 January 2009,Hamster do not belong in Balls!,"I think Bolt is a great Film with the usual Disney-love, but the maker commit the same error, whitch they committed with ""Finding Nemo"". A large number of children have been unintentionally killing pet fish by flushing them down toilets after seeing or hearing about a scene in that Film.Now this mistake was Repeated whit ""Rhino"", the Hamster in the Movie ""Bolt"", whos Locked in a Plastikball.Please don't lock your hamster in such a ball. Otherwise they cannot sense their environment anymore, even the sight is muted by the plastic material. The hamster doesn't understand where he is and will mill around in panic, which is interpreted by his human fellows as 'joy'. These spheres are repugnant to the animal welfare. It's so sad that the makers of 'Bolt' don't play for the keeps about that!"
78,Bolt,9,15 November 2008,He's such a good boy!,"I have been awaiting this film ever since my workplace (theatre) started playing the trailers in the lobby, which was around mid-July or so. And tonight, I was definitely not disappointed (thank you sneak peek!) Bolt is an animated feature about a dog who has superpowers and saves his ""person's"" life on a day to day basis - or so he thinks. After being duped into thinking Penny was not okay at the end of a scene, Bolt makes a run for it to rescue his beloved Person. And lo and behold, he ends up in NYC! It's a long-winded journey back to Hollywood, full of plots, schemes, hamsters, cats, and learning how to beg. Bolt won his way into my heart easily, and I don't think he'll disappoint fans everywhere!"
79,Bolt,8,22 November 2008,The biggest delight of the year,"It's been a while since I've been this pleased with a film I've seen in the theater. ""Bolt"" was a film that all ages could enjoy. It was not only very funny but a very touching movie as well. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus were perfectly cast as the voices of Bolt and Penny, respectively. The plot twist toward the end, which I won't give away here, was one of the most pleasant movie surprises I've seen in a long time, and I had to check my tears at this point. The opening scenes are some of the most exciting action-packed scenes I've ever seen, especially for a kids movie. Aside from all of this, ""Bolt"" may not be the most original movie I've ever seen. It has elements of previous Disney films, such as ""Toy Story"" (1 and 2) and ""The Incredibles."" It's not entirely perfect, as some occasional supporting characters can be annoying after a while. Nevertheless, I was able to overlook all of that considering how much I enjoyed and was touched by this film. It's easily the best film Disney has released since ""Enchanted."" A few more pleasant surprises like this each year would be great. This is the first film I've seen in a while that I've been eager to recommend. Great for kids and adults, and worth paying to see at the theater.*** out of ****"
80,Bolt,9,22 November 2008,A surprisingly entertaining movie,"I saw the trailer a couple times and was not impressed at all. But we decided to go and see it anyways when we found out it was also being shown in 3D, since my girlfriend is a big fan of anything 3D. I'm sure glad we did.The trailer just doesn't do the movie justice. The dialogs were very well written with plenty of wit and humor. Doses of reality of life were added to the old dog-trying-to-rescue-girl-owner plot, making it less corny and more moving. The voices were also done quite well-I was especially impressed by Susie Essman as the jaded stray cat. Although I have to say throughout the movie, I had to fight very hard against the image of a bald middle-age guy with an expanded waistline overlaying a cute and cuddly dog.In my opinion, Bolt is the best animation so far this year."
81,Bolt,4,22 November 2008,Good Entertainment - Not a blockbuster.,"As far as Disney titles go - this movie hits the mark with regard to pure entertainment value. The story moves along quickly and it was enough to keep my 4 year old's attention throughout. Parents should also find a few on screen gags that will keep them immersed in the film. Throw in a few explosions and some mild peril and it's also a winning combination for older kids too. The effects are good but not ground breaking - such as the slow motion ""Matrix"" type effects which have been overdone in so many movies nowadays. The animation itself is nothing new - same old same old as far as shape, texture and quality. Another area where I think it falters a bit is in the predictability of the story line. If you watch the trailer before going in to see this movie, you will be able to predict basically what will happen at the end. This is after all a Disney movie so to even imagine a less-than-happy ending is impossible. I would recommend this movie to others as a solid Disney adventure movie - a good way to pass an afternoon. Is it a ""must see""? Well, I saw it on it's opening weekend where the theater I went to (In a huge well populated mall on a Saturday afternoon) was about half full rather than being packed like I imagined it would have been for a Disney flick released right before Christmas."
82,Bolt,7,29 April 2012,"Brilliant concept, pretty well executed","The movie starts out as an almost cheesy crime fighting adventure film with superheroes and gadgets and the whole deal. It lasts a few moments before finally the reveal at the end of the ""show"" that it's actually just a TV show and is all fake. From there on you know interesting stuff's going to happen.One of the twists though, is despite nearly everyone knowing it's a TV show, the dog, which is one of the superheroes, thinks the show is real life. He thinks he really has powers and really needs to save his owner who (in the latest TV show) ends up being taken but not rescued (as a response to a request from someone from networking). So he's off in the real world to try to find her, in the meantime she thinks he's gone forever.I really liked how they mixed the TV studio concept with friendship. I'm into video editing and I really enjoy seeing how people make TV shows and movies and despite from a slightly fictional world it's still cool to see how their TV show could have been ""made"" if it were real life.Anyway, I want to rate it 8 but it's not quite there to make the full rounds. It did a brilliant job with the ending and I really enjoyed it, but I don't feel it's a 7 either. It's like a 7.5. But IMDb doesn't let you do that, so I'd just rate it as 7.So I rate it 7.5 out of 10."
83,Bolt,9,20 April 2012,The movie was just so awesome!,"Well, i saw the movie once on some cable TV network and it was some glimpses, some of its scenes were so appealing and made me download the movie from torrents which i did but the torrent was of no use cuz the format was unsupported and wasn't able to find the related format from google too... in the end managed to watch it from the beginning till the end and it was just great! Don't really know if the movie won any awards or not but it should have! Those emotional scenes are truly appreciated where the Bolt feels sad moments. There's no vulgar stuff in the movie so would recommend every kid to watch and learn the true friendship! :)"
84,Bolt,8,12 April 2011,"Not quite a Disney classic, but one of Disney's better films of the 00s","I have been a big Disney fan all my life. After quite a solid Renaissance, with only Hercules and Pocahontas lacking that extra Disney magic, the Disney movies of the 00s have been mixed. Emperor's New Groove and Lilo and Stitch were great, on the other hand Home on the Range and Chicken Little were forced, predictable and forgettable.Bolt did have me interested, but I wasn't as enthused with the initial casting of Miley Cyrus, who I can't stand. Actually in the movie, she does okay and her character is quite cute.While it is far from amazing and far from a Disney classic like Beauty and the Beast, Pinocchio, The Lion King, Bambi and Sleeping Beauty, Bolt is one of the better Disney movies of the 00s. It does have its rushed and predictable spots, especially with the ending, and the human characters excepting Penny aren't as appealing and aren't given as much attention to detail as they ought to have done.But what does compensate are some stunning animation with excellent character design, amazing colours and beautiful background art, a rousing soundtrack, a fast-paced and heart-warming story overall and witty scripting. The voice work is top notch, while John Travolta is suitably eloquent as the title character the real plaudits go to Susie Essman as the best character of the movie Mittens and Malcolm McDowell as Dr.Calico.In conclusion, a surprisingly enjoyable family movie and one of the better Disney efforts to come out so far in this millennium. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"
85,Bolt,10,12 March 2009,I loved it!,"I have a 3 year old female Westie who gave birth two months ago to a happy-go-lucky boy. A friend told me I'll love the movie, and lo! Five minutes in, I called them both to me (even though the Offspring wet my bed only an hour earlier), and just cuddled with them for the entire duration of the movie. So, if you have a dog, don't miss this unpretentious little film. And if you don't have a dog, see the film and get one right after! :) or a Cat. or a Hampster (an excellent character, funny and witty).And show it to your kids. Show them that, apart from yours, there is only one other form of unconditional love."
86,Bolt,10,13 December 2008,A transcendent movie,"The best movies transcend their subject matter. Rocky won Best Picture and Rocky Balboa (Rocky VI) should have because the focus of the movies went well beyond boxing and appealed mightily to those who had no interest in the sport. And so it is with Bolt!, a Disney movie.On the surface, Bolt! is an animated kid's movie about a TV super-hero dog raised on a TV set,who never sets foot outside the studio. He is enormously believable in his TV role because he truly believes he IS a super-dog. The enemy falls at his superbark, walls tumble before him, iron bars bend in his paws, his Boltstrike causes bad guys to collapse as he valiantly saves his little girl partner Penny from doom.Then, to enhance his concern for the next show, a kidnapping is staged. Penny is kidnapped, but only until tomorrow's show. But to Bolt, it is real. He escapes to save her and by a fluke is transported across the country. When he breaks out, he is not in Hollywood, but in New York..and in the never-before-seen Real World.Slowly (and humorously), he realizes that his Super-powers are not real. But his resolve never weakens. Told repeatedly by a cat he picks up that humans do not really love animals, that a fine free life awaits him on his own, that Penny has replaced him by now and shorn of his powers, Bolt's relentless drive to return and save Penny from danger shines like a beacon on his cross-country voyage back to Hollywood and the girl he loves.Along the way, he picks up the hilarious Rhino the hamster, a big fan of his show. Rhino talks like a macho movie hero ""(""it's a good day to die!""), but he is of course a hamster. He believes in Bolt, the superhero. In the end, Bolt is forced to deal with a very real danger without his powers and with only his hamster sidekick and his courage as allies.In sum, the movie offers great humor,excitement and a display of nobility of character you won't see often. Take a kid or go with adults. Either way, you won't forget Bolt!"
87,Bolt,8,9 December 2008,Winning Disney Animation & fine comedic tale for all ages,"BOLT (2008) *** (Voices of: John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Susie Essman, Mark Walton, Malcolm McDowell, James Lipton, Greg Germann, Diedrich Bader, Nick Swardson) Winning Disney animated family fare with Travolta gamely voicing the titular pooch, a TV star, who winds up becoming a fish-out-of-water, when he sets out on the loose from his studio confines into the world to protect his owner Penny (Cyrus), with some help in the unlikely forms of a sarcastic street-smart alley cat (Essman) and a totally game for adventure at any cost hamster (Walton, who steals the film whole-heartedly). Fast-paced and footloose, the comedy and heart is equally balanced in this winning comedy of errors. (Directors:Byron Howard & Chris Williams)"
88,Bolt,8,7 December 2008,Good entertainment value,"With many good animation flicks in 2008, Bolt has rightfully cemented its place among Disney/Pixar's masterpiece CGI/animation collection over the years which began with Toy Story over a decade ago. While it will not be a classic like Finding Nemo nor as good as one of my favorites, The Incredibles, it is a very enjoyable animation movie.Bolt has the right touches of heartwarming moments, action sequences, and funny scenes (some of Bolt's thunder were stolen by a hamster inside a ball named Rhino so watch out for them), and the concept was quite different in that the protagonist thinks he is an actual super dog. That was new.My wife and I saw this, and we have to say that we left the movie theater feeling good and entertained. It will have to be tied with Wall-E for 2nd best animated movie that I've seen in 2008, behind Kung Fu Panda and ahead of Madagascar 2. I went into this not having as high expectations like when I went in to see Madagascar-Escape to Africa... my expectation coming in was just OK; it was comparable to when I went to see Kung Fu Panda (which was far exceeded by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, and the rest of the Dreamworks' team). So it was a pleasant surprise that there was something different to the plot, and that the funny moments were well placed.The movie may be less star studded compared to KFP or Madagascar 2; sometimes in the other movies, you can imagine the famous actor while he's delivering the funny line (say, Jack Black as Po or Chris Rock as the Zebra) so it's a little different with Bolt because neither John Travolta nor Miley Cyrus is as well known for their over-the-top comedic voicing, but I think that the casting was quite solid.The guy voicing Rhino was pretty good, especially considering the producers could have gone with one of those well known ""big"" comedy guys like James Belushi or Kevin James. But here was a guy voicing a really funny character pretty well, so kudos to the movie's producers for going against the grain and not following the usual Hollywood thing and hire someone well known.Overall, the movie was well-paced, the story was simple but clear, and there was a good balance of entertainment value.Something worth watching, guys! Enjoy!"
89,Bolt,8,1 December 2008,One of the better ones lately,"I took my family of five to see this over TG weekend, expecting a good, but not outstanding ""kid"" adventure film. Usually when I do that, I come away a bit disappointed. Not this time. The characters were fantastic. It was smart, heartfelt, and didn't try to do too much. This film avoided the ultra-sappy message that it could very easily have shoved down our throats. Instead, it let the audience get there themselves.The opening scene is absolutely mind-blowing - the graphics and stunts felt like I was watching something out of the Black Knight or the Matrix - it was outstanding and really got you going at the start. My wife and I were looking at each other and saying ""Wow, this is awesome."" Bring your kids and have a good time."
90,Bolt,9,23 November 2008,Eye-popping 3D,"The visuals are incredible here. The 3D makes you forget you're watching a cartoon. I'm 40, so Disney was, of course, a big part of my childhood. This film is way beyond anything I know from Disney.The action scene that begins the film is like the climax scenes of three actions movies like Die Hard, Bourne whatever or a Bond flick, with incredibly well thought out choreography. The buddy film that follows is wildly imaginative, fun, and heart-warming.The best running joke in the film is that, wherever you go in the US, there are three-pigeon groups with the exact same makeup: A fit, mouthy pigeon, a stocky simple minded and soft-spoken pigeon, and a completely moronic skinny, bug-eyed pigeon. It sounds dumb, but it works! Someone at Disney did what the hard-nosed executive in the first act of this film did: They demanded something new and exciting. The crew on Bolt delivered!"
91,Bolt,10,15 January 2018,amazing,I love this more than popcorn and I reallyy love popcorn. yasssss bolt slayyyyyyyyyy
92,Bolt,7,30 September 2017,A reminder of Disney's late 2000s reset button,"This film in my watchlist happened to be on Amazon Video on our brand new television set, so I decided to knock it out given its obscurity in the Disney animation canon. It isn't as appreciable as Meet The Robinsons from my experience, but then again, I did view this when I was feeling somewhat fatigued. While the story and writing are comprised of some things that aren't necessarily original, the animation is highly fluid (which surprised me, to be honest) and highly complements the assortment of action scenes, especially in the ""movie within a movie"" that is the Bolt series. Bolt himself is not just likable because of the cuteness factor exploited in the introduction; I appreciated his general steadfastness towards Penny, contributing to the movie's highly effective heart. Penny is especially relatable to the common child actress, who often develops bouts of negativity as their career continues, to the point that it affects their work. It was really painful (in a good, and I don't mean masochistic, way) to witness Bolt's recasting given the character and ""character within a character""'s relationship with movie and MWAM Penny. The other characters are generally less essential, but do contribute more to this movie's message of cooperation and perseverance that prove especially important to audiences involved in cinema. As I said, it isn't as original in execution as it is in concept compared to Meet The Robinsons, but it still shows that Disney had come a long way from Chicken Little even before the dawn of the Neo-Renaissance. If you appreciate dogs, movies within movies, or Disney, then I expect that this movie will please you. It's fine for most others as well."
93,Bolt,7,15 July 2017,A surprising treat,"I enjoyed this slice of Disney fun. No songs which makes a nice change (although Disney do great music). Travolta does well..it seems he is a better actor behind a microphone than in front of a screen. The beginning of the film is cleverly done and hooks you instantly. Although the rest of the movie does not keep this pace and excitement, it is still a great buddy movie with lovable characters and a decent journey to follow. Bolt definitely shows off some significant leaps in animation with some nice effects on the animals and the environment. Not at Pixar's level of course, but still with a CG sheen that now defines the later Disney films. I particularly loved the pigeons throughout...the characteristics are spot on, as are the little nuances used in the animation. Brilliant."
94,Bolt,8,1 October 2011,"Forget other CGI Disney movies, THIS IS THE REAL DEAL","Jasper102011 reviews Disneys Bolt When I seen movies like chicken little, i woke up 6 Min's after the credits! I had a ruff day when I seen this movie and I seen it on opening day in 3D just the first 5 Mins, I was in for such a big treat.The score was amazing and got me in the mood straight away and the comedy was put all around the movie. It had a interesting plot, however it was the hamster that stole the show.Not only for the kids, it has something for the whole family.The only disappointment was the 3D and Penny's agent can be super annoying This movie is worth at least one watch and you're going to laugh at some point."
95,Bolt,,18 August 2011,A very cute family film!,"I love all of Disney's films, but Bolt is one that stands out from the rest. Upon seeing the trailer I was eager to see the film and I wasn't disappointed!Bolt and his owner Penny are the stars of a popular TV show entitled 'Bolt', which is about a dog who gained incredible powers in order to protect his master. But there's one thing: the director of the show goes to great lengths in order to convince Bolt everything is real because 'If the dog believes it, the audience believes it'. Because of this, Bolt can't have a normal life and spend quality time with Penny, who is tired of her life and the fact that she isn't allowed to bring Bolt home after filming. Ratings for the show are failing as every storyline is the same and ends with Bolt saving Penny from the evil Dr Calico. To save the show from being cancelled, the director created a cliffhanger ending with Penny being kidnapped. Bolt is horrified and escapes his trailer to find Penny, but in the struggle, he ends up on the streets alone. Still believing Penny is in danger, he is determined to get back and seeks the help of streetwise kitty Mittens and Bolt's biggest fan, the hyperactive hamster Rhino. But as time goes on, Mittens makes Bolt realise he has been living in a fantasy world and shows him how to be a 'real' dog.Personally, I love it. This is one of Disney's greatest films and I can watch it again and again without getting bored. I adore Rhino and if you do too, then you will love the animated short 'Rhino'.I think Miley Cyrus as Penny was a serious case of miscasting, but she isn't in most of the film so I can forgive and forget.If you're looking for a film to watch with the family, something to watch alone or to give to the little ones, then Bolt is a sure thing. The entire film is very feel good and you will love the perfectly fitting soundtrack."
96,Bolt,5,15 January 2009,Another boring animation film,"Disney is still trying to escape from the mediocrity which was on visually sumptuous but narratively very poor films like Atlantis : The Lost Empire,Treasure Planet and Brother Bear.After that failures,they thought 3D animation would save them,but craps like Chicken Little and Meet the Robinsons left clear the most important thing is not the technique,but the story.Bolt is another false move from Disney and they back to prove they are miles away from getting the artistic quality of its ""frenemy"" Pixar.The main premise from this movie is moderately ingenious but the execution completely lacks of any energy and the action sequences and moments which should be funny or emotive,feel very forced.The voices also lack of any energy.The worst guilty of this is John Travolta,whose monotonous intonation totally lacks of dynamism.Sussie Essman results bland and Mark Walters tries to emulate the maniac intensity from Jack Black but he does not get it.I never try to analyze the logic of the screenplay and characters motivation on an animation movie too much,but that is not an excuse for an arbitrary screenplay which has action,humor and emotive moments as basic blocks from co-screenwriters Dan Fogelman and Chris Williams but which never feel natural.This movie does not feel like that because the screenplay uses clichés and arbitrary manipulations to get to an obligatory point...in other words,the story is not fluid.And this is something which I truly hated from this movie : the reason for which the dog Bolt believes to have powers is ridiculous and it results an insult for the spectator.It seems Fogelman and Williams do not have any respect for the spectators and that they thought : ""It's a kids movie...they are not going to notice any absurd things"".Bolt is another boring animation film.It's slightly better than Disney's previous efforts but that's not saying too much because the movie falls on the fatal mistake of being boring.And that's something impossible to excuse."
97,Bolt,3,20 February 2009,Plummeted to the ground to a slow recovery,"Now why do you take the 3 poster characters and add two only mid in the film? Because it had a really slow start.The first 10 minutes we get one of the worst action spy flicks in history. Choppers (both) on standby, bionic superdog, a small kid with an attitude of all MI6, cheesiest villain in the world and much like that just happens. Then we get a crummy explanation that it's all a movie (which we knew from the start from ads and trailer so cut it down to 5 min) with ""plausible deniability"" candid camera for the dog alone. The audience (kids) can tell that Lassie is faking it? Better yet, explain how they change the scenery the size of a city, or how the dog can leap propeller blades. The entire ""a bad movie inside a movie"" doesn't work.We get a sanity break with realist ""to the point"" Mindy, and the cats, and the look alike henchmen with the set crew, before Bolt gets extracted into the real world and we get the plot of the film (at about 25 min). After that it's the same old ""Travel coast to coast to find true love"" with a ""fight to be loved"" in the end. The montage music was too distracting to enjoy the montage itself.Mittens improves the movie with animal street experience and intelligence. Rhino, the fan geek parody hamster, was a plus  we don't see these characters in big parts, so this was slightly original. But his ""I'm also 1/16 wolf and part wolverine somewhere"" made me ""If I had kids, they would ask how is that physically possible"". My favorite were the henchmen small speaking parts, they actually seamed more alive and with a life than the girl. And what's with the agent? How many pins did he put up over the series? How Bolt learned to talk and read before he learned what hunger was? Who paints the bolt on Bolt, because the bolt smears? The first bunch of pigeons are blind by pigeon standards and dumb to fly away from the cat. The second are even worse and annoying. I agree with the hamster on ""no aliens"" part.Some compare this to The Truman Show. It's more like canceling the Truman project in the mid of film and giving Truman the boot. Plus Truman wanted to leave and we are left to wonder when he does. Bolt is just to predictable and the jokes about him and his actions are worn out.So I gave a 3/10 because of Mindy, Mittens, Rhino and the henchmen. Would have been more if they didn't plummet for 10 minutes at the start. Hope the creators are smart enough to quit while they are ahead and not ever make a sequel."
98,Bolt,4,14 June 2009,"Funny, but","I really do have a problem with movies, that try to be SO clever, when in fact they are not. I won't spoiler anything big, I'll only talk about the beginning of the movie, but I still wanted to warn people who are not ready to read anything about the movie, before they go watch it or rent it.The problem here is, that while we get treated to an action movie, without apparent cuts, without any obvious special effects (yes I know it's animated), the fact that the first couple of minutes are a movie within a movie is a big cheat. Not because you might get fooled to think that is the actual movie, before they pull the rug under your feet (there are other movies, who had these beginnings too), but because everything that happens there just couldn't happen.I know it's animated, so in fact it couldn't happen either way and then it's a movie, so it isn't real by definition. But still the main Dog (Bolt) does stunts, that he isn't able to do. Leaps/jumps as if gravity didn't exist, just to have a problem jumping in the ""real world"" ... I can't laugh about that, because it ain't funny to me, because in the end, he couldn't jump that far in the first place.So everything that gets build up in the first minutes is a big cheat, which doesn't work and therefor isn't funny in the progress of the movie, when all the ""superpowers"" get smashed (even the stunt driver explanation doesn't work and don't get me started on ""where do they put their cameras? Everywhere? With a focus on everything?) Again, that might seem short sighted for some, but I couldn't enjoy the movie as much as I would have loved to (and the Hamster is really mostly funny, plus a ""nice"" cat). The flow of the movie isn't right, if things get established ... but actually aren't established, because they are lies/cheats. If you can overlook that, you might enjoy the movie more than me (I still gave it 4/10, because it has it's moments, that aren't inspired by some false predicament in the beginning)"
99,Bolt,6,20 December 2008,"So much better than I thought it would be, but having seen it I don't need to see it ever again","Solid and good film about a dog who doesn't know he's not a super hero who escapes from his pampered existence when he thinks his human has been kidnapped by the man with green eyes. Enjoyable and breezy the film is completely unremarkable other than the occasional one liner or throw away gag. I enjoyed. It was fun but I never need to see it again.Why isn't this a great film? There are any number of reasons.-A good number of the gags are in the trailers -once you know the set up it kind of just follows the course it set out -it looks like every other computer generated animated movie -Its as manufactured as the show Bolt stars in. -The music is unremarkable-to the point I noticed it wasn't all that hotWhat would have been great would have been had the film been made in 2-D animation like the end credits. Had they done that it might have been something to see.As it stands now its a good film, but utterly disposable. You'll watch it once (and really enjoy that one viewing) but probably never again"
100,Bolt,3,6 January 2009,neh...,Hmmmmmmmmm... definitely not what I expected. Good story. Good characters. Good graphics and use of 3D. But for some reason the movie falls short of being one of the better animated movies. It drags on a bit. Definitely not as funny as your led to believe in the trailer. Basically its about a dog who thinks the TV show he's in is real. Until he escapes into the real world and discovers the truth. Its heartwarming and cute and blah blah blah. Nothing to really hold you. Me and my partner spent the majority of the time yawning. You can sit through it.. its not one of the worst movies of all time.. just not on a level with the greater animations of this yr like madagascar2. I rate bolt a 3/10
101,Bolt,4,5 December 2008,Cute animals does not a good movie make,"when i first heard of this movie, it was still called American Dog, which is a terrible, terrible title. i also didn't care for John Travolta voicing the titular character. Travolta as a dog just didn't sit right with me, and it still doesn't when i think about it. but eventually when i saw the trailer it really did look right! what didn't look right were the voices of Mittens the cat and Rhino the hamster. they're really darn cute characters, visually and i really like that they didn't go with big voices, but i still feel like they should have kept looking.but Bolt (MUCH better title)starts off very very strong but starts to fizzle around the time bolt gets stuck inside a box that apparently gets shipped to new york. how the heck does he breathe the whole time he's in there with all those packing peanuts? i mean, there are some mildly amusing moments here and there but for the most part it becomes pretty formulaic, except for at the climax when bolt doesn't EXACTLY become the hero like you might think.also, if you are a cat lover, you might not appreciate some of the action or dialogue that kind of seem to suggest that cats are inferior to dogs."
102,Bolt,5,17 February 2012,A fair - but all too forgettable - kid's flick.,"I liked parts of Bolt, but it has so many flaws and logic inconsistencies that I eventually had to shelve a 'normal' review and remind myself that 'it's just a kid's movie'. Funnily enough I never have to do that with Pixar films.Bolt (John Travolta) is a scrappy little white superdog with a spunky little 12 year old tomboy owner named Penny (Miley Cyrus). They adore each other and spend each day saving both each other and society Only they aren't. It's all merely a top rating TV show in which everyone is in on the ruse except Bolt himself  he is apparently a better actor when he believes it is real. At the conclusion of each day saving the planet Penny takes Bolt to his trailer, gives him some food and a hug, and leaves until next time. There is no offscreen cavorting or playtime. (Which if you think about it is especially cruel once you realise why.) Bolt is frankly amazed one day to find that he does not actually have a superbark, laser eyes or the ability to leap dozens of metres. This unfortunate day happens when he is accidentally posted across the country from Hollywood to New York, immediately deciding he has to get back to LA as Penny is no doubt worried and susceptible to evil without his protection.Now without effects, hidden stunt wranglers and choreographers Bolt is merely a little dawg, even his distinctive bolt shaped marking on his fur proves false. He cannot do anything super or extraordinary, and pain is now very real. What he can do is talk  but of course  which enables him to converse with a scrawny streetwise alley cat named Mittens, who Bolt bullies into providing him with assistance in getting cross country.Along the way they meet a hamster named Rhino, who is not only aware of Bolt's TV identity, but who considers himself Bolt's biggest superfan. He tags along to form a trio of furry fun, only he never leaves his exercise bubble along the journey, a cross country trip that was never destined to go smoothly.Meanwhile in Hollywood Penny has already realised her buddy is lost and is desperately trying to track him down even as the TV studio exhorts her to move on and find another dog to play the role the show really must go on with or without Bolt.Bolt has a couple of reasonable action sequences  most notably the opening few minutes before the audience is let in on the facts  and a few reasonable jokes, mainly from Rhino the deluded hamster.I found Travolta a strange choice as Bolt the dog, I know he boasts 'star power' but is that really a determining factor when the audience is always going to be predominantly children? Miley Cyrus is a similar 'name' choice, but at least she sounds like a young girl.Final Rating  5 / 10. Ultimately Bolt never proves itself as anything more than a kid pleaser, and even then it is bettered by many other films. The opening sequence grabs you and Mittens and Rhino are reasonable kid's flick characters, but Bolt collapses under its own lack of logic.Put another way my 4 year old gets to watch a movie per week in 30-40 minute installments. He has seen maybe 10 films including Bolt. He continually asks for Nemo and Toy Story again and again. Bolt hasn't been mentioned since first viewing furthermore I don't plan to offer it up as an option."
103,Bolt,6,30 May 2009,Third act saves the film,"Sadly, having just seen the film it's been proved to me that for the most part, the nomination process for the Best Animated Feature Oscar pretty much is limited to the films that get the most promotion and make the most money. Therefore, those who nominate the films will bother to sit down and watch it, and since it's the one they remember at least hearing about, BAM! It gets nominated.About an hour into the film, I found myself just checking the DVD timer to see how much longer the thing was going to run. The story was OK, but all in all it wasn't holding my interest, and the hamster character was being shoved down our throats in an over-the-top ""Hey! He's cute and manic and therefore, he must be funny!"" way. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus didn't seem to be clicking for the main voices either, they were just rather ordinary. Malcolm McDowell was hammy but for that particular character, it worked. Susie Essman was the only voice actor who seemed to try to give her character, Mittens, a real soul that transcended just being a ""cartoon voice"".Fortunately, the last 20-25 minutes got more interesting, with the fake-out of Penny supposedly falling in love with the ""new"" Bolt, plus the rather dramatic pacing of the climactic fire and rescue. For this, to go the Siskel and Ebert route, the film overall gets a ""thumbs up"". However, I can't see ""Bolt"" being all that remembered and revered years from now. The Disney films from the last decade that people almost never recall immediately are such ones as ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" and ""Hercules"". In 2019, ""Bolt"" will likely be parallel."
104,Bolt,7,9 March 2009,Paint By Number Of Highest Quality,"Although this largely is a ""been there, done that"" experience, it manages to be very entertaining throughout and even a bit moving in the right places. Says something of the developers involved i suppose. Quite reminiscent of films like Ice Age and Finding Nemo, parents wont mind seeing this, in fact they might chuckle as much as the little ones.Its about this dog (Bolt) that is made to believe he has super-powers in order to extract the best performance in a action-filled TV-show. When through an accident he is separated from his beloved co star, the girl Penny, he naturally starts to search for her. Assuming that she has been kidnapped by evildoers. Along the way he encounters some seriously funny (albeit somewhat annoying) characters that help him in his quest, with becomes as much a tale of self-discovery. Its definitely better then Finding Nemo, i mean, that one didn't have any character development at all, but its also a bit derative.First i figured i would give it an 8 but then i figured it isn't memorable enough for such a grade, even if its of highest quality. So 7 i suppose. And off course it looks great too (is this even worth meantioning with Pixar and Disney films?)."
105,Bolt,,9 March 2009,An enjoyable family adventure,"Bolt and his owner Penny are superheroes, thank to a treatment from Penny's dad, Bolt has powers greater than your average dog and endlessly has to use them in big action sequences. Or at least, this is what he thinks. The reality is that none of it is real and it is just a TV show, with the facade kept up to ensure Bolt gives a great ""performance"" each week. Chance separates Bolt from Penny though and sees him accidentally shipped to the other side of North America. Once free from his packaging ""prison"", Bolt surmises that this is the work of his nemesis and sets out to locate and rescue Penny. The other animals he involves in his quest meanwhile, wonder how to break the news to him that he is, well, just a dog.There is a downside associated with Pixar making so many good animated films and that is that the bar is raised so high that ""good"" films are judged harshly against criteria that they weren't really setting out to achieve. This happened to Bolt, although it fairness it doesn't help itself in the comparison stakes by essentially being the Buzz Lightyear part of the Toy Story films. It ended up being criticised for its lack of depth for adults and how the sentiment is just that, rather than emotion. This is perhaps unfair because Bolt came out in the same sort of year as Wall-E did, the latter film dominating all before it and rightly so.What Bolt delivers is a plot that allows for comparatively simpler emotion that is just about enough for adults without being too much for children, the message is simple and it is delivered well. The majority of the film though is about comedy and action. It opens with a greatly inflated action sequence from one of the bolt TV episodes that shows good awareness of the action-movie genre and entertains as such. From here it goes the familiar path of self-realisation along Bolt road trip back to Hollywood and this aspect is perhaps not as complex or as engaging as it could have been but at least it is entertaining. Most of this comes from the side characters as Bolt himself drives the plot more than the laughs. The animation is impressive of course and the direction is good, again with its visual references to other things and also the delivery of shots that would not be possible in ""real"" action. I saw it in 2D so I can't comment on the 3D effects.The voices are good although the stars don't really steal the show as they can do. Travolta isn't anything special but does the job as Bolt without bringing a lot to the character that isn't delivered by the animators. Cyrus is OK and gets to sing the song in the film as well. Essman and of course Walton are the real good turns though, mostly due to them having the better material  likewise the pigeons, who are all good characters. McDowell, Bader, Lipton and a few others add colour but have smaller roles.Bolt is not Wall-E and in fairness it should not be judged by that yardstick. However, what it is is an enjoyable family film that delivers a good plot, great animation and regular laughs  and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that."
106,Bolt,9,30 December 2008,Bolt is a movie that will surprise you!,"I had low expectations when I went to this movie in theatres. I knew vaguely what the plot was: A dog thinks he has superpowers but really doesn't and gains new friends. Don't get me wrong, I was excited to see this movie, I just wasn't expecting it to be so good. Right off the bat, the movie draws you in with an adorable sequence of Bolt as a puppy meeting his future owner, Penny, for the first time. Right after this scene, the movie gets a much darker tone for a couple minutes as Penny and Bolt find out her father has been kidnapped. A long scene follows where Penny and Bolt are racing to the airport to save her father from the bad guys. After this part of the movie, we find out the none of this is real and Bolt is the canine hero of a popular TV show. We find out that Bolt has been led to believe that everything that happens in his TV show is real. Meaning, Bolt would have superpowers and be fighting against a notorious supervillian. Through certain circumstances, Bolt believes that Penny has been kidnapped by the TV show's main villain. It's all fake of course and his owner wasn't really in danger at all, but poor Bolt is led to believe otherwise. Bolt accidentally gets sent thousands of miles from his home and must find a way to get home and save his owner. Along the way, Bolt gains new friends in a witty stray cat and a lovable geeky hamster. In the movie, Bolt finds that his powers are not real. Despite realizing that everything he has believed is a lie, Bolt knows he has to make it back to his owner. I won't give away the ending of this movie, but let's just say it's very touching.Bolt has amazing music and animation. In some scenes of the movie, you could swear your watching something in real life( for instance, the first scene that shows clouds). Disney knew precisely what they were doing when they made this movie. This movie shows that, while superpowers are awesome, they don't make a hero.I have seen this movie twice in theaters so far. I would recommend at least seeing it once on the big screen. You may want to explain the movie a little bit to children, as certain things can be hard to grasp for little kids.Overall, I give this movie 9/10 for amazing score, animation, and story."
107,Bolt,8,9 December 2008,It was totally Awesome and Cool,"The movie was totally awesome and cool. Even, the first scene was totally awesome and cool. Especially, Bolt was very super and fantastic. At the beginning of the movie, Bolt was very cute. When, Bolt is running in the city, that time he do some actions thinking he is a superhero, that scene is totally funny. When, Bolt and Rhino are in a animal shelter, that time Rhino is totally awesome.I like Bolt's powers like Laser Vision, High Jump, Super Strength, Super Bark etc when he is acting in the TV show. Even, Bolt and Penny are acting in the second TV show, that scene is also awesome and cool. Even, Penny looks very cute. When, Bolt, Mittens and Rhino are travelling by a train, that scene is totally awesome and thrilling. When, Bolt and Penny are in a cabin, that time Bolt is very funny. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Bolt""."
108,Bolt,6,7 December 2008,Disney learns from its past mistakes. Great!,"Yes, it has seems that the comeback of good-quality family movies from Disney is near. Having learned their mistakes from duds such as Underdog and The Shaggy Dog, Disney presents to you ANOTHER dog movie... but wait! This is a whole lot different and better in every aspect. Taking a new premise with a predictable story is no surprise, but the filmmakers add heart and soul to it, thus making it another Disney classic.Take the characters for instance. Their designs and voices are so convincing to the audience; it makes them cute and lovable as ever, and makes you just want to hug them. Travolta adds likability to the title role, and surprisingly, so does Miley Cyrus as Bolt's owner/co-star Penny. Susie Essman adds wit to her feline character and that hamster is just very funny.The cinematography is great, the special effects a treat for the eyes, and the music score by John Powell is rousing. (Coincidentally, during Bolt's ""mission"" in the beginning, Powell's score contains shades of his Bourne scores).Overall, a pleasant surprise from Disney and definitely a step up. A must watch in the cinema for a fun and great time with the family and friends.Overall: 8/10"
109,Bolt,3,7 January 2009,Why is this rated so high?,"This film is by far one of the worst i have seen at a cinema for a long time. It bored me to death and i think, by the countless amount of people who left the cinema, most other people there thought so too.I went to see this movie a few days ago because it was 3D i wanted to see something different, something to make me go ""WOW"" but this did the opposite. The 3D was crap to say the least, i found the experience better without the glasses which, by the way, hurt my eyes AND ears and made my experience a little bit worse.This film targeted all the things i dislike in a movie. 1) Animals talking. 2) Cheesiness. 3) Boredom. And lastly 4) A movie that has been done before in many different costumes. This movie has cliché written all over it.Avoid. 3/10 pushing 4/10, but not quite."
110,Bolt,5,2 March 2009,Too Disney,"Bolt is a star. He's an actor playing a superhero dog in a series in which he and his owner, a little girl, go through several ordeals trying to save the world and themselves. The good thing is, he's doing a fine job and everyone likes the series. The bad thing is, he doesn't know he's an actor and actually believes he's a superhero. When an event is created that takes his co-star, who he believes to be his owner, away from him he thinks it to be a true crisis and goes to the rescue.So far the story. Good enough, it's only a simple animation film after all. And like most of todays animations it leans a lot on the actions of several side characters and their interaction. I love the cat best, and the hamster plays a good part too. But all in all the combination just doesn't work out too well. It is too much of a standard story packed into too much of light headed animation. The animation is up to par with what can be expected today, nothing wrong there, but it doesn't really add to the story and that makes the ending result just too thin.Added to that is the fact that this is a pure Disney film and that is seen in the way the story flows - all the elements of the classics are there and it has to be said that the day for the classics is done and should be changed into a new rhyme instead of repeating it over and over.5 out of 10 super barks."
111,Bolt,,23 March 2009,Shallow and predictable,"Bolt is proof that not everything Pixar produces is gold. On paper the idea behind the plot is okay. But...well, here's what I didn't like about it: The whole idea that Bolt never, ever noticed the film crew, or that all of the show's effects were on-set, is just dumb and unbelievable. Probably they did this to avoid making Bolt look stupid, but it just makes him even dumber for never noticing - for instance in the scene where he holds the car off the bridge; they could do that in no other fashion than with wires, especially with the actor inside, and for Bolt to not notice them or notice whatever is really holding the car up, is ludicrous; how did the crew even set that scene up? Did Bolt really carry the car with the guy inside it all the way across town to the bridge?. A ready-made excuse for him to notice the film crew but still not know it's a TV show would've been to have him believe they're a documentary crew always following him around.The human adults (excluding the actors playing Dr. Calico et al and Penny's mom) are all such obnoxious jerks. I hated this. The snobby director, the cold TV executive, the annoying ""hip"" assistant? They're all such a bunch of slimy creeps and stereotypes. Usually Pixar is above this. They make the TV executive mildly likable, but just when I thought the assistant was going to redeem himself by showing some concern for Penny, he reverts back to his old self just so we can have some (unneeded) comedy with Penny's mom throwing him out of the ambulance, and, ultimately, so Penny can take the moral high ground and quit. A better ending would've been Bolt continuing to do the show but also be a regular dog in his time off.The only likable humans were the animal shelter guards. They were hilarious (""Spicy eyes!"" indeed). And they disappear from the film as soon as they're introduced.Ultimately I think the movie would've been better off if they'd just done the entire movie like the opening sequence. Maybe downplay the absurdity of it all to make Bolt less powerful, and Dr. Calico and his henchmen more of a genuine threat, and just do a plot where Penny is kidnapped for real and Bolt's weakness IS actually styrofoam and, de-powered, he has to enlist the help of Mittens and Rhino to rescue Penny and her parents from Calico and save the day without his powers. The same as the actual movie only he would've really had powers to begin with, and there'd be less pretentious moral posturing. Instead Pixar basically decided to do a retread of Buzz Lightyear's character arc from Toy Story, but with a dog.Of course, had they done it that way, people would've accused them of ""doing The Incredibles with a dog,"" so I guess Bolt just can't win.So what is there to like? It has its moments. As mentioned, the guards at the animal shelter were a riot, and so was Rhino most of the time. Mittens had her moments, too. And even though he has perilously little screen time, Dr. Calico was a hoot as well and so were his two cats. So basically all of the little details worked, but the big, main story involving Bolt and Penny was clichéd and above all else was just dull and uninteresting."
112,Bolt,7,23 December 2008,"Bolt is another animated hit from Disney and features a dog, a cat, a hamster, and a sweet-hearted young actress....","Bolt is another animated hit from Disney and features a dog, a cat, a hamster, and a sweet-hearted young actress. This feature is about a loyal young dog who uses his super powers to protect his owner from the forces of the evil green-eyed man. However, early in the film, the audience finds out that the poor pup is being tricked into believing he has super powers by the movie studio so that his acting will be more realistic for their hit action show. It takes an unlikely pair in a cynical alley cat and an obnoxious hamster to help him realize his value as a regular dog. The animation is quite good, but the 3D doesn't add much in my opinion. The CGI is plenty good by itself with its crisp and clean realism and its bright colors and lighting. John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Susie Essman, and Mark Walton's voices are perfect for the characters, especially Essman's as Mittens, the cat. The soundtrack is good, but too much attention is being paid to ""I Thought I Lost You"" by Travolta and Cyrus, which was recently nominated for a Golden Globe. Instead, one of the highlights of the movie is when Jenny Lewis's ""Barking At The Moon"" plays during an especially sentimental sequence. Adults and kids alike should get good value from this film."
113,Bolt,8,29 November 2008,Strong outing from Disney - voices a bit weak,"Overall I thought Bolt came together very well, hitting all the notes of humour, action and some genuinely poignant moments. The only area which I found a bit weak were the two voice leads, Travolta and Cyrus depend far too much on their physical personas in their acting to convincingly inhabit their characters, frankly they are a bit boring.The exception was Mark Walton as the hamster Rhino. Who is this guy? He nailed his part, and obviously had a lot of fun with it, a very impressive performance.As others have mentioned, this movie was much better than the trailers suggested. Or perhaps it is because the trailer itself didn't try to include all of the ""best bits"" of the movie, like so many do. Not a bad idea to tone down the trailer a bit so that the audience can still be surprised by the originality and spunk of the script."
114,Bolt,8,22 November 2008,"Skip Madagascar 2, this is the one to take the kids to","In Bolt, a small American White Shepherd dog has amazing adventures, not realizing that none of it is real. The little guy (whose voice is provided by John Travolta) is actually the star of a highly rated action show for kids, but the show's director is a believer of method acting, and wants the dog to think the things that happen to him on the show are real to get a more natural performance from him. On the show, Bolt the dog travels with his young human owner, Penny (Miley Cyrus), cross country searching for Penny's father, a scientist who has been kidnapped by the diabolical madman, Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell). Bolt has been genetically enhanced to have super canine abilities (actually special effects that are performed right there on the set), and uses those abilities to battle Calico's forces.The concept of an actor on a TV show living in a make believe world, and not realizing his every move is being filmed by hidden cameras reminded me greatly of the Jim Carrey drama from 10 years ago, The Truman Show, and made me wonder if this was going to be another look at the same idea aimed at a much younger audience. The movie drops this idea fairly early on, and turns into a standard road trip comedy, but I wasn't disappointed. The film has plenty of wit, charm, and heart to go around. Bolt is forced to hit the road when he believes Penny is in danger. The most recent episode ends with a cliffhanger where the girl has been kidnapped by Calico. After the shoot, Bolt is sent to his private trailer as always, but believing that Penny has actually been kidnapped, he breaks free and ends up accidentally inside a shipping box which is sent to New York City. In his strange real world surroundings, Bolt initially doesn't understand why his ""powers"" don't work like they usually do. He's still determined to track down Penny, even in his supposed weakened state, and forcefully brings an alley cat he finds named Mittens (Susie Essman, wonderful here) along for the ride, believing that she has ties to the evil Dr. Calico and can tell him where his human is.The relationship between the delusional dog and the street wise, sarcastic cat is at the heart of Bolt, and also what makes the film work above all else. I loved the way that Mittens the cat begins to train him in the art of being a real dog. Bolt has been living a fantasy his entire life, and has never even experienced the joy of playing with a chew toy or sticking his head out an open window with his tongue flapping in the breeze. With so many animated films forcing the idea that animals are just like us, only with fur, here is a movie about a dog who learns to enjoy the simplicity of a natural life. I liked that angle, and I liked the way that Mittens slowly warms up to Bolt's situation. She's a cat with a past, as she used to belong to some people who were forced to abandon her when they moved. She doesn't understand Bolt's devotion to Penny, as she believes humans can only hurt. The spot on vocal performances by Travolta and Essman add a lot of the heart the character's hold.Also along for the trip is a pudgy little hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton), who is familiar with Bolt through watching his adventures on the ""magic box"" from his cage. He's mainly there to provide comic relief, and though kids will likely enjoy him, I found him a little grating. Fortunately, the movie never allows him to distract from what works. I was surprised by how sympathetic Bolt is, and how much I ended up caring for the characters. Even young Penny gets some effective moments. The preteen actress has always felt bad about having to lie to the little dog, and make him think their adventures were real. When he runs away, she feels responsible. As mentioned earlier, Penny is voiced by pop singing sensation and actress, Miley Cyrus, and this movie hints that she may have a future after the Hannah Montana fad comes to an end. The film is wonderful to look at, too. The visual style is bright and vibrant, and the character designs carry a lot of personality. When we see Bolt as a puppy at the very beginning of the film, playing with a toy, it's filled with much more character and emotion than any of the live human actors can muster in this weekend's other big release, Twilight. I also greatly admired the attention to detail in many of the film's settings. There's a brief montage where the three traveling animals visit different landmarks as they make their way cross country, and a shot of them watching the famous ""water show"" outside the Belagio hotel in Las Vegas looked like the real thing. This movie makes even the well animated Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa pale in comparison. The fact that this movie has some actual soul and heart behind it, unlike that mediocre cash-in sequel, certainly helps.Over the years, the Disney studio has been trying to catch up to the works of Pixar with some of their own in-house computer animated films, and the results have up to now been middling. (Does anyone really remember Chicken Little or Meet the Robinsons?) Bolt is by far their best effort to try to capture the tone of a Pixar film, and while the film takes a few wrong steps (mainly with its unfunny comic relief character), it's definitely the closest they've come to their league. Bolt proves you don't always need original ideas as long as you have a lot of genuine emotion and likable characters on your side."
115,Bolt,1,13 March 2009,"Absolute garbage from start to finish, with Susie Essman being the only saving grace.","Disney is the one company most renowned for its universal animated classics, and all these years has only scarcely stepped outside that genre. Though undoubtedly that has been a wise move. It is there that they truly belong, and dozens of prestigious awards that they now have up their sleeve ought to prove it. What's more these achievements aren't just for critics and award judges to adore but audiences to yawn at, they're incredibly entertaining. Naturally they are all very simple, but also full of incredible characters, spectacular animation and beautiful storytelling. Though of course, this is all in the past. Bolt is a perfect specimen of what the company produces nowadays, quick one-dimensional flops whipped up carelessly and effortlessly that bore anyone under the age of eleven out of their brains. To create the story, screenplay writers Dan Fogelman and Chris Williams have taken ideas from 'Stardust' (2007,) 'Toy Story' (1995,) '101 Dalmatians 2: Patch's London Adventure' and who knows how many other films. The animation makes us question whether they put Lego people in front of the camera instead of using computers and the voice cast is half asleep. With the exception of Susie Essman, who is the only cast member that bothered to put some effort and energy into her performance. Though she mightn't have enough fame attached to her name to be mentioned up on the poster with John Travolta and Miley Cyrus, she put a certain realistic liveliness into her character that none of the others could be bothered to do - perhaps they could have, but thanks to their laziness we will never know. But as wonderful as she was, she also is  sadly  bound by the dull script and can never truly flourish.The faulty failure opens with an action-packed chase scene styled like one from a sci-fi adventure television series to introduce canine superhero Bolt (Travolta) and his sidekick owner Penny (Cyrus:) the heroic duo in an epic battle against the sinister 'green-eyed man.' (If you try hard, you may just manage to enjoy this long, exhausting scene.) Then we hear a director yell ""cut!"" and see the sky, train, ground, and everything else assumed real being taken down to reveal that everything we just saw was  in the world of the film  part of a TV show. (Shame that the advertising gave that twist away.) Though there is markedly absolutely no difference between Penny and Bolt and the actors who play them (again in the world of the film,) apart from the fact that in the real world Bolt is just an ordinary dog. But while Penny is easily able to distinguish between the world of the show and the world of reality, poor delusional Bolt isn't. He believes that everything being performed on set is actually happening, including his powerful 'super-bark.' So after a scene is filmed that ends on a cliff-hanger in which Penny is kidnapped the poor clueless mutt escapes from the studio and embarks on a ridiculous search for his owner, manipulated by three imbecilic pigeons into dragging a terrified rebellious scruffy old stray cat (Essman) and picking up a demented hamster Bolt TV series fan (voiced by Mark Walton, who tries to be as distinguished as Essman but instead awfully overdoes it.) From there we have about half an hour of redeeming fun before a predictable and seemingly never-ending conclusion.It is now finally clear that Disney has forever lost its touch and should immediately consult Pixar before they even begin to make another animated film from now on. Walt would never have allowed this disaster to occur, but he's long gone and so is his legacy. But hey, get used to it. This film isn't the first of its kind and it certainly won't be the last. So let us let go of the past and brace ourselves for a long and tiresome future."
116,Bolt,,27 December 2016,Full of Friendship,"This movie seriously reminds me of the Disney works from the 90's, full of friendship, adventure, good feelings and vibes between a dog and his owner. The all concept and storyline is very clever, and in the middle also brings the touch of reality with the difficult but relevant theme of companion animals abandon, and the black holes of Hollywood multi- million dollar cinema industry. Bolt offered us an extreme positive message  unconditional care and love are far more valuable than self- interest, money, fame or notoriety. On the other hand, the viewer is also presented with a huge amount of humor and action, brought by another amazing characters like the pigeons or the hamster. Over all, we are facing another huge hit and magical work by Disney brilliant animators."
117,Bolt,8,15 June 2016,"Great story, Cute Disillusioned Dog, And This Weird Hamster Thing= Bolt","Six Point Nine?!!!?!! SIX POINT NINE?!!?!What kind of an idiot rated this movie! Overall,this is one the best animated movies ever made! This is the story of a Dillusioned dog and his return to realty,(Yeah, he sells houses),you know what I mean.That's ""reality"" for anyone who didn't quite get that.On to the basic story line, A movie company has tricked this dog into thinking he's he's a real dog for their show, and he gets the idea into his head that his owner is always in danger. During the show, his ""Person"" gets taken away from him and he believes she's been captured in real life.He then sets out on a journey to rescue her and ends up being shipped to the other side of the U.S. Anyways, he meets this cat and this hamster who tell him that he's a normal dog. He then sets out on..... Oh,The Heck with it! Go and watch the movie."
118,Bolt,8,22 May 2016,An Exceptional Animated Film by Disney,"Bolt is directed by Byron Howard and Chris Williams and is the very original story of a dog that regularly stars in an action/adventure television show. Despite it being a fictional television show, Bolt, the dog, believes in every second of it. When he mistakenly gets shipped from Hollywood to New York, Bolt must, with the help of new companions Mittens the alley cat and Rhino the small hamster, get back to Penny in order to save her from the threat that he wholeheartedly believes is real.Bolt is, as far as animated films go, one of the most underrated films ever created. With its combined amazing voice acting, animation, and very clever writing, Bolt is a great film, with a lot of style and substance. Coming from Disney in a dark streak of theirs, Bolt didn't have any expectations from me, yet it impressed me on every level. The low amount of recognition Bolt gets is unacceptable, because it is a substantial film.The voice acting is what really elevated Bolt to the next level. The talent of John Travolta, Susie Essman, and Mark Walton add for a great team littered throughout the film. John Travolta pulls off the brave, big hearted Bolt with a passion that live action actors can't usually bring to an animated movie. Both Susie Essman and Mark Walton as supporting characters Mittens and Rhino back up the lead role with a large amount of vigor, and play their characters considerably.The animation is top notch for the standards held these days, and impressed me greatly. The animators smartly knew to blur the background while giving the foreground much detail, which, overall, made the characters pop like a bubble. Each and every character stood out, be it Bolt, the superdog, or Penny, his ""human."" Although the background was blurred, like mentioned above, it doesn't look cheap. None of the animation looks rushed, and it all looks very clean.My main issue lies with some conveniences thrown into the plot. Despite Bolt's target audience being smaller children, it was obviously directed somewhat to an older age as well, proved by its tear inducing moments cluttered throughout the movie. At certain times in the plot, the characters may be in a place in which the writers didn't seem to have a plan to get out of, yet, soon enough, a large factor in the film will suddenly purpose itself, and everything will work out for our heroes. Although this issue isn't that prominent, it really bothered me, and took enjoyment away from film altogether.The clever writing in Bolt impressed my on a very large scale. Almost all of the dialogue, particularly between the characters of Bolt and Mittens, is absolutely flawless, with great banter and sly exposition thrown in the middle of it all. Once thing going for this is the difference between their species, a dog and a cat. Their characters' contrast added for a great relationship between the two of them; a relationship the entire audience can relate to.Another minor issue I found in Bolt was the slow exposition. Due to the extravagant plot, the film takes its time to set up for the adventure that's about to come. Once the adventure kicks into gear, the film begins to move very quickly, but the exposition seems to drag on just a tad too long. If the script would've removed a few unnecessary characters, namely a pair of annoying cats, then the first fifteen minutes (or so) may have moved faster.The last thing I have to mention about Bolt is the fantastic score. The musical score, composed by John Powell, is absolutely golden. Every single minute that any sort of action was taking place, the score was pounding, demanding that the audience sit on the edge of their seats. The viewer already cared about the characters, and their goals, but with the astounding score booming from the speakers, the audience begins to care all that much more about everything that's taking place in the film.Overall, Bolt is one of the best animated films that Disney has made in a long time. Pretty much anyone will relate to, and enjoy, this excellent movie."
119,Bolt,8,10 May 2016,"Rendered a Soft Appeal & LookSolid Entry in the ""Cartoon"" Canon","Cute and Cuddly at times, this Disney Animated Feature is far from a perfectly conceived Story that has a Familiar Feel, but is Loaded Up with Laughs and Endearing Characters. The Triple Bonding of a Dog (Bolt), a Cat (Mittens), and a Hamster (Rhino) on a Road Trip is the Stuff of Life Lessons and Content of Character Building.Despite some Clumsy Storytelling and Transitions, like the End of the First Act, threatens to make the Movie a Chore to Sit through, it does become more Engaging as it Settles into the Story Conceit and Fancy Footwork.Although Rhino (the Hamster) has many Fans, He really is the Weakest of the Lead Trio, and often seems like He is there to give some Confidence to Folks Forever Fighting Weight Problems and is the one relied upon for most of the Comedy Relief. He is Upstaged by the Pigeons.Overall, it's a Charming Children's Film that has some Appeal for Grown-Ups. The Animation is Smooth and Silky and the Graphics are Muted Somewhat to Render a Softer Appeal. It Works. Will most likely not Attain Upper Echelon or Top Shelf Status but is a Solid ""Cartoon"" and a Respectable Genre Entry."
120,Bolt,7,3 February 2016,Cyrus Bolts Animated Style.,"Bolt (2008): Dir: Byron Howard, Chris Williams / Voices: John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Susie Essman, Mark Walton, Malcolm McDowell: Energetic family animation about dependable friendships. Bolt is a movie star dog whose whole life is movies and he believes the plot lines as real. When he ends up in the outside world he faces hilarious facts about his suppose superpowers. Simple, formulaic but satisfactory. This film will appeal to family audiences as well as present humour around reality TV. Directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams are backed with detailed animated characters as well as a great choice theme about reality and fantasy. John Travolta voices Bolt who learns of real life but just when discouragement threatens to set in, he will discover what true courage is all about. Susie Essman voices cat Mittens with sarcasm. Mark Walton voices delusional hamster Rhino. Both characters work on great comic levels despite their formula driven presentation in subplots. Miley Cyrus voices Bolt's owner Penny who misses him and cannot really perform with the replacement. She will also learn what true courage and friendship is all about. Malcolm McDowell voices the villain in the movies and programs that Bolt is famous for and takes ever so seriously. Well animated family comedy as well as a hilarious attack on reality, fantasy and knowing the difference. Score: 7 / 10"
121,Bolt,8,10 October 2015,A good story about dog's friendship,"It is a good cartoon titled Bolt is able to please not only the young fans of cartoons from Disney, but also will be a perfect pastime for their older brothers and sisters and parents. After all, the good Disney cartoons are eternal and always please their audience. Excellent proof of this - Adventures of Bolt and his friends. Cartoon somewhat naive because of its main character, but it just adds to it the atmosphere of joy and warmth, was the confirmation of this nomination cartoon for ""Oscar"" as the best animated film. He himself tells the story of a very good PSE, which is an actor and plays the role of a dog with superpowers. All anything, that's only the Bolt has no idea that his life - it's just a role he believes with all his heart that it is his reality. Therefore, once in the city alone, the dog is faced with great difficulties, and the situation begins to seem hopeless is to help him not get new friends. But can spend Bolt's friendship through all the trials to the cherished goal, which ever seem so far away."
122,Bolt,8,28 August 2015,Bolted to a good rating.,"After the very good Meet the Robinsons, I tried not to have too much high expectations for Bolt, as two good ones in a role for Disney animated movies in the 2000s were rare. However, after watching it, I was also pleasantly surprised! It's an interesting story about Bolt, an American white shepherd, who is the star of a fictional TV show, but has lived his whole life on the set and believes he really has superpowers. When separated from the studio by accident and believing his co-star, Penny, really got captured, he sets off on a journey to rescue her. Along the way, he meets Mittens the Cat and Rhino the Hamster and learns the truth about himself.This movie started very heavily on the sci-fi stuff and seemed like a copycat of the motion picture, The Truman Show. In addition, some of the characters including the movie agent and the studio manager acted too superficial. However, what ultimately resulted was more than just typical Hollywood superfluous stuff and cliché action heroes; there were actual meaningful adventures and drama, from Bolt lost in the city when trying to find Penny to him learning the truth about himself and life in general. I've also found that the character Mittens was witty and humorous, especially when she appeared oblivious when Bolt actually thought she was partly responsible for Penny's disappearance. The growing friendship and teamwork that the animal characters eventually formed were also meaningful and gave the movie heart.The CGI animation is colorful and detailed (I especially liked the various cities), and the direction is well-paced - it makes you eager to find out how everything will unfold at the end. Like Meet the Robinsons, it's one of the better Disney animated films from the 2000s.Grade B"
123,Bolt,8,11 February 2014,Two paws up!,"Every time I watch this film, I like it a little bit more. That's three times I've sat through it, and my ever-growing appreciation has increased it's rating from 7 to 8. Huzzah! There's an action packed plot, decent CGI, appealing characters and some great lessons about pet ownership. What's not to love? Bolt thinks he's a superhero dog from a TV show... when in fact he's just a regular pooch. Accidentally knocked out and transported from Hollywood to New York, he is forced to team up with a snarky cat called Mittens (My favourite, both for her species AND her sarcastic demeanor) and a hyperactive hamster who goes by the name of Rhino to find him way home.Bolt's cluelessness about the outside world (he's lived in a studio for all his life) and his attempts at performing his non-existent powers are the basis for much hilarity, along with Mittens's ever sardonic remarks and Rhino's never-say-die attitude (in comparison to his size).But there is something deeper here, about the unspoken bond between an animal and it's owner. Bolt KNOWS his 'human' loves him, despite her being an actress... and Mittens was absolutely devastated to be abandoned on the streets of the Big Apple, unloved and declawed... (A disgusting practice which is thankfully outlawed here in the UK). The speech she gives about why she doesn't trust people late on is heart-rending to the core. Rhino, on the other hand escapes from a trailer park during the movie... and we never hear from his owner again. Well, he seems happy enough...As I've shown, rewatchability is high due to the little things you'll miss along the way, and the end result is one of the most purely joyful ways you can spend 90 minutes. Especially if you're an animal lover. Guilty as charged. 8/10"
124,Bolt,7,19 January 2014,"Cute dog, good animation","Bolt is a Hollywood star of a spy thriller TV show. The interesting thing is that Bolt doesn't know the show is fake. He believes he's an engineered superdog in reality. When Bolt gets accidentally shipped to NYC, he must travel cross country back to the studio.It's got a cute dog and a workable premise. Although a dog with real superpowers would probably work even better in today's superhero obsessed movie world. The constant superpower delusion does get a little tired. It goes from being cute to making the dog look stupid.Eventually, he does figure it out. The movie needed it. It's not going to win any awards but the quality is there to compete."
125,Bolt,9,15 May 2013,MAN do I love this caper,"When I first saw Bolt I wasn't into it,but when I decided to give it another shot I instantly became a fan of it. From the director and screenwriter that brought you Disney's 50th Tangled,Bolt tells the story of a dog named Bolt(voiced by Grease's John Travolta)who thinks that he has superhuman powers and that his an actual hero little does he know that its all a pack of lies and its really a TV show where his charcther is a superhero dog and he teams up with a teenager called Penny(voiced by Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus)to defeat the man with the Green Eye. But when Penny gets kidnapped,its up to Bolt to save her from this villain,and so on his journey he meets a streetwise cat named Mittens(voiced by Susan Essimen)and a bipolar hamster called Rhino(voiced by John Walton)and the two embark on a hilarious adventure together to save Bolt's owner.The story for this movie is brilliant in fact I love animal movies some make me cry actually take that back ALL animal movies make me cry and this one was definitely another one as there was one particular scene that had me weeping but im not gonna spoil it for you all so you have to see the movie yourself.Surprisingly the voice cast was good too in fact it was weird hearing John Travolta voicing an actual dog,while some of the kid's favourite Miley Cyrus was great too. The Animation is flawless you can't complain about CGI cause its taking the world by storm so you know what if you love animal movies like me then check out this sweet charming tale about friendship and courage.Bolt gets a 9.5/10"
126,Bolt,8,29 March 2013,Bolt which predicts a tear on our cheek,"Penny adopt a dog that years later would be part of a television show. Bolt believes his supernatural powers are real and after an episode in which his mistress he was taken prisoner escapes from his trailer and runs to save but get in a box that is shipped just on the other side of the continent. Aided by some pigeons he is taken to a cat (Mittens) and he begins the journey back to Hollywood. On the road is convinced that he has no power and is actually a normal dog and learn habits that needs to know, such as asking for food or play. The film has a happy ending, Bolt manages to get to Penny but only after passed through several adventures. From this animation learn to pay more attention to animals, love them more and see that they will protect us and save us from danger. A film for the whole family that I would see it again with great pleasure."
127,Bolt,10,31 January 2013,One of my all time favorites.,"If you've read my Happy Feet review, you know that it is near impossible to break into my top 5 favorite movies. However, this film managed to make it to spot 3. Honestly, most of why I like it is personal preference, but that doesn't mean it didn't have its general appeals. Every aspect of a Disney animated dog movie had me hooked. I love Disney, I love dogs, I love dog movies, I love Disney dog movies, I love animated dog movies, I love Disney animated dog movies, and this was the first of the latter to release in my lifetime. I'm a love of all pets, so for there to be a cat and hamster in addition got me hooked. The film is very clever and very inspiring, with incredible characters. I will admit it is not as ""actiony"" and fun as some may expect, but that does not hinder it in my opinion. I can't say this film is for everyone, but if you watch it, I'm sure there's a good chance you'll like it."
128,Bolt,7,27 January 2013,Another awesome Disney film.,"BOLTI am a huge Disney fan... but had never seen this one before.It did not disappoint... I loved it.It is about a dog who is an actor in a TV show, but he doesn't know he is acting. He believes everything that is happening and even believes he has super powers... until he escapes the set to rescue his owner and discovers he is a normal dog.The story was really good, pretty much a typical Disney film. It had action, adventure, sadness, happiness and fun! The only thing this film didn't have which is always expected from a Disney film was songs... there were no singing and dancing in this film at all.The voices were provided by John Travolta and Miley Cyrus. I couldn't actually tell if Miley was the voice of a cat or the little girl. But John Travoltas voice is unforgettable. You knew his voice as soon as his character spoke.This is a great Disney film, but it is not as good as a lot of the other classics. Disney lost it's touch a little bit. They made amazing films like The Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty & The Beast, The Little Mermaid to name a few... but unfortunately they don't seem to be as good as those any more. They pulled it back with The Princess & The Frog and Tangled which were awesome. We will just have to wait and see if they can keep it up now.I will give this film a 7 out of 10.A great film, but still not Disney's best.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
129,Bolt,8,26 January 2013,Bolt  A animation buddy picture with action and fun,"Bolt is a funny animation movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults that are kids at heart. The humor is not multilayered so that you can enjoy it on a number of different levels, but it's hilarious.As far as I'm concerned, Rhino is the laugh star of this ensemble, close behind are the pigeons. Bolt, even though adorable, is the least funny one of the cast, probably because he's such a straight face hero. I won't rob him of his glory though, because we want him exactly like that, he's driving the whole film. Mitten fits right in as the unwilling sidekick.The story is very engaging, if without any surprising ideas. The intro is a blast of super powered action. The dialogs are good. The animation is sweet with bright colors and very effective. Voice acting is nice and without any reproach.I'd say it's a solid animation, just lacking a bit of depth."
130,Bolt,10,3 September 2012,One of Disney's Best!,"I am a complete movie buff and simply love watching movies of all kinds,it must be entertaining.Disney has produced amazing movies and Bolt is one of their best.But Toy Story will always be on top of my list.Bolt is a story that shows the bonding between an actress Penny and a dog,Bolt.John Travolta and Miley Cyrus have lended their voice to the movie and have done it amazingly.Bolt is a film, very sweet, very nice,with a touch of emotion.The story is as usual pretty unoriginal but this does give it a soft touch that can pull at the heart strings in places.It looks great with some very detailed fur action going on and brilliant movement copying with other animals such as the pigeons.Bolt the dog, is very sweet and cute throughout the movie. The funniest parts tend to be with the funniest character.Solid film for all and one of the best by Disney but still little below my all time favorite Toy Story!"
131,Bolt,,9 June 2012,Oh Look. ANOTHER Disney Movie I loved!,"I Actually saw this movie on Starz on demand In 2010. I loved it back then, and now have a strong interest in it. I then bought it and re- watched it. Here's my N and P. Negatives: if you were a 9 year old kid watching this, and you didn't give two craps about what the adults are talking about, like, (agents, Television show making, etc.) then you would find the movie VERY boring. While he's funny, Rhino the hamster was a pointless character. Positives: Amazing animation, Great voice actors, humor is good, the plot is very oringal, Very entertaining.Overall, The movie is VERY good. But with few tweaks here and there. 9.0."
132,Bolt,10,29 March 2012,Such an underrated film,"This nice animated film totally deserves more love.It wasn't made by Pixar, but it was pretty good, having very good animation, many funny moments and very likable characters.In my opinion, it was the best thing that Disney (without Pixar) have done in a long, long time. And from my personal taste, I enjoyed this way much more than ""Tangled"", mostly because ""Bolt"" feels way more honest than that film (Which seemed mostly like a desperate attempt to resurrect the classic animated fairy tales done by Disney)The voice acting was pretty good, I never thought that Miley Cyrus was able to do such a good performance, and John Travolta's voice acting fits perfectly with the main character. However, my favorite character was Rhino the hamster (played by Mark Walton) which is one of the funniest characters form the history of recent cinema. I think that Rhino is funny enough to have his own movie."
133,Bolt,7,19 April 2011,Bolt,"It isn't often that Disney make a computer animated film without the help of Pixar, only example I can think of is Dinosaur, but there came this one with an intriguing sounding story. Basically Penny (Miley Cyrus) is the girl with her American White Shepherd dog Bolt (John Travolta), who has many superpowers to defeat all the villains of the city, only thing is, it's not real. Bolt has been raised in a television studio as the star of the show, and he has been made to believe everything he does on the show, powers, villains, etc, is real. So on one episode, a two parter, Penny appears to be kidnapped by the henchmen of Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell), and Bolt thinking this is reality makes his escape and accidentally winds up outside of Hollywood, to New York City. Looking for and trying to ""rescue"" Penny, he meets alley cat Mittens (Susie Essman), cats to him are the enemy, and she plays along with his delusion until he can work out the truth and find his owner. In their journey and a few adventures they also wind up meeting and being joined by Bolt enthusiast hamster in a ball Rhino (Mark Walton), who also believes everything he does is real, and Bolt thinks he is some kind of all-knowing creature. Meanwhile, Penny, who earlier was sad she couldn't spend a day with Bolt as a regular dog, is upset that her confused Bolt is missing, but the studio urges her to let go and find a lookalike to continue the show. So after a number of adventures, travelling to Las Vegas, and discovering regular dog activities, such as hunger and fetching sticks, Bolt does eventually work out that he is not a super powerful dog, after being saved by Rhino. Another adventure or two, and the three animal friends do reach the studio, but Bolt is saddened to see Penny getting close to a lookalike dog, not realising she is just acting, it is only when a fire breaks out and Mittens convinces him of the true feelings that he can go back for her. In the end, after rescuing her from the fire, Bolt and Penny finally reunite as a regular girl and her dog to have a regular fun life together, with Mittens and Rhino joining as well. Also starring James Lipton as The Director, Greg Germann as The Agent, Diedrich Bader as Veteran Cat, Nick Swardson as Blake and J.P. Manoux as Tom. It is good that the critics mention the connection of The Truman Show with this, is is pretty much the same concept, just with a superhero theme, Travolta makes a good voice for the canine hero, Cyrus, annoying as she can be in real life, does the female character voice quite well, Essman is quite good as the sarcastic cat, and Walton steals many moments as the hyper fan hamster. The animation is fantastic for the story, it is heartwarming and really quite funny in many moments, and most of the scenes of action are exciting, a really watchable action comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Animated Feature Film and Best Original Song for Miley Cyrus and Jeffrey Steele's ""I Thought I Lost You"". Very good!"
134,Bolt,8,1 March 2011,I was pleasantly surprised,"At first, I didn't feel like watching this movie. It seemed childish, a story about a superdog that gets lost from its owner. But after watching the trailer I came to see otherwise.I loved it. Especially because of the sarcastic cat named Mittens. It gave the movie that extra touch to make it great. I was touched by Mittens past and how she wanted to take care of Bolt, and then got rejected. I didn't expect that sort of emotional depth in the movie, but there it was.Bolt may appear like a kids movie about a silly dog, tricked into believing he has superpowers, but it's much more than that. The dramatic hamster Rhino and the sarcastic Mittens make the picture complete.Their interaction is simply hilarious. And of course, the animation is flawless. The ending is as you'd expect, but I wouldn't want it any other way. Must-see for kids, and adults whom enjoy animated movies."
135,Bolt,8,26 February 2011,"Disney, Welcome Back: We Missed You","What do you get when you take a directionally-confused company, give it to John Lasseter for the breath of life, go 3D and merge The Truman Show, The Incredibles and Dr. Doolittle into a nice package? You get Bolt, a surprisingly-entertaining movie that may have very well removed Disney Animation Studios from life-support and brought them back to centre stage.John Travolta voices Bolt, a dog who acts as a superhero and constantly rescues his owner, Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus, go figure,) in an over-the-top action show that both makes fun of and puts to shame Michael Bay. The only problem? He thinks it's all real. So when Penny is ""kidnapped"" one day by the green-eyed man, Bolt-thinking she's in trouble-dashes out of his trailer and decides to search the country for her. Along the way, he meets up with a black cat named Mittens (Susie Essman,) whom he believes is in league with Penny's kidnapper, and an obsessed fan/hamster, named Rhino (Mark Walton,) in a comedy that teaches people about the dangers of blurring fiction with reality.In terms of the movie itself, this is Disney at its finest: you have the comedic relief (i.e. Rhino,) the intricate subplots-Penny's relationship with Bolt, the corporate hold on both Penny and Bolt-the running gags-the pigeons standing next to billboards with his face on them and still not knowing who Bolt is, Bolt attempting to use his superpowers and failing-and the crisp-clear animation, which converts surprisingly well to 3D. Adding to the excellence of this movie is Lasseter's supervision, especially since you can't go wrong with a guy that made talking toys, talking insects and monsters in your closet work so well in practice. Despite Bolt not being up to par with the typical Pixar film, it's nice to know that the legend himself has added a few ""Pixaresque"" moments to an otherwise standard Disney venture.Overall, this is a very fun and enjoyable film. Despite the disappointment of this movie not being as funny as I would've liked it to have been, it certainly had enough humour that I found myself laughing in places I never thought I would've when I sat down to watch it. Additionally, the voice-acting was top notch (no surprise there,) and it's a relief to know that Miss Hannah Montana is actually in a role for a change that WON'T make you cringe in irritation. I also liked how well the movie transitioned from its ""action sequences"" to its real-life sequences, as it showed just how much care Disney put into making the audience truly believe that there was a show within a show. If that's not proof that animated movies can have just as much heart as live-action films, I don't know what is.Bottom line, this is a must-see for Disney fans, animation fans and just movie fans in general. Disney gets a lot of sh*t for making cheap and emotionally-draining movies these days, but Bolt has actually paved the way for a revival of Disney Animation Studios and shown that not all hope is lost, especially given the two movies that the studio released following this one. Bolt has action galore, suspense, humour and-most-importantly-heart. It's not the best thing to ever come from the company, but I'll be damned if it isn't the start of Disney's slow redemption.Final Score: 8/10."
136,Bolt,10,22 July 2010,Something for everybody!,"Totally awesome! Here's my firs review ever on IMDb, and this time about Bolt! The dog Bolt and his owner the girl Penny is in a sci fi TV show in New York City, and Bolt think everything is real.But, one day are Bolt ending in the real world.Bolt is missing, and he travels across the states with his new friends the cat Mittens and the hamster in ball Rhino.The dog and his friends ends up in Hollywood at last, but Bolt has to save Penny under a fire in the studio.Here is something for everybody! If you want action, drama, humor, thrills and heart it' all here!"
137,Bolt,10,25 May 2010,A favourite!,"I have just had the pleasure of taking some time out of my day to enjoy a truly wonderful movie. I enjoyed Bolt even more so than I did. I expected just a cute movie with beautiful animation. I got that, but so much more. Beyond the detailed visuals and funny and cute characters, lies a wonderful message. Bolt is a movie with a true heart to it, if you will. I also applaud Disney for the portrayal of rescued animals, and I hope that this movie perhaps may have inspired people to adopt (after proper research of course) their next addition to their family. I truly recommend this to the whole family, both young and old!"
138,Bolt,8,20 November 2009,Delightful fun from start to finish.,"John Travolta stars as a superstar dog and Miley Cyrus is his owner in Disney's 'Bolt'.Although this movie lacks the awe that some other movies like 'Wall-e' and 'Up' had, 'Bolt' does manage to entertain us and please adults as much as kids.John Travolta is a very talented actor and I think that him playing a talking dog was the right thing to do.Get someone else to do it and it might not have been so good.Famous singer/actress Miley Cyrus plays Bolt's owner, and I honestly have to say that she didn't do a bad job here.Her music may suck because of how clean the lyrics are and the look of her movie looks Razzie worthy, but she manages to do a decent job in 'Bolt'.I also have to give a hand to the some of the action sequences and mostly the animation.In short: 'Bolt' is a fun 96 minute animated movie that's delightful fun from the very start to the very finish."
139,Bolt,10,15 July 2009,"Better than you would think, much better","This movie, produced under the guiding hand of John Lasseter, best known for his role at Pixar for bringing us such greats as Finding Nemo and Ratatouille, is possibly Disney's best film in nearly 10 years. The movie follows the story of Bolt, a dog who plays the role of a super powered dog on TV along with his costar and owner Penny, but to him it's all real. In order to get the most realistic performance out of him the show's producers keep him convinced that all his powers are real and not the result of special effects. An accident results in him being shipped across the country to New York, still following the delusions he's been fed all his life, he meets up with a cat named Mittens and a hamster named Rhino as he makes his way from New York to LA, learning the truth about his life along the way and even though realizing his life is a lie, holds on to a single truth, that Penny loves him, even when he has doubts about that as well. The actors do an excellent job in bringing the characters to life, John Travolta does well as Bolt, giving him sincerity as the character moves from his fantasy world and embraces reality. Susie Essman provides the voice of Mittens the cat, she has a lot of depth and is possibly the most ""real"" character in the movie. Miley Cyrus provides the voice of Penny but she is seen very little and speaks even less, she is probably the movie's weakest link, but her role is so small it really doesn't matter. Finally there's Mark Walton as Rhino the hamster, Rhino provides most of the movie's humor, in one word he's hilarious. In addition to the action and comedy the movie has some truly touching moments that really give it an emotional core. The movies also has a couple of musical segments, in the form of Barking at the Moon by Jenny Lewis and I Thought I Lost You by John Travolta and Miley Cyrus. Barking at the Moon is an absolutely beautiful song that epitomizes the movie's story and is perfect for the montage sequence it accompanies. I Thought I Lost You is at best an average pop song, but it's only heard during the credits and does not detract from the movie. Truly a fantastic film, perfect for any age."
140,Bolt,10,28 March 2009,bolt,"bolt is about a dog that thinks that every action thing that goes on is real. And that he has real powers. but when he gets out and is in the real world. he finds out that he powers don't work. when he meets a street cat, she tries to explain to him that he is on a TV show and that his powers are fake. on the way back they meet a hamster that is a really big fan. penny (miley) gets a new dog to try to fill in bolt but it isn't the same. bolt finds out how to get food from motor homes by doing cute moves. when they get back to the set, bolt thinks that penny forgot about him and that she got a new dog and loves him now. but she really misses bolt. when the set goes into flames, penny is in danger, bolt saves her. she quits Hollywood and spends time with bolt."
141,Bolt,,22 January 2009,Hollywood dog,"A Californian dog will learn to be like a normal dog in this film, a family Disney film that I saw with some familiars yesterday. I wasn't aware of the fact that Bolt is presented in 3-D then was a surprise to find that at my local cinema Bolt is been screened only in 3-D, certainly more expensive but Bolt absolutely worth the money. Passed like 2 or 3 years to see another movie in 3-D since the last time was when I saw the re-release of The Nightmare Before Christmas. Was curious the fact that yesterday I saw, for the very first time, the trailer of the up-coming Henry Selick movie Coraline but anyway, the name of the mentioned Californian dog is Bolt, nice white dog, Bolt is more specifically from Hollywood, he is the star of a TV show and not only his world is only the Hollywood studio but also he believes he has all the powers and enemies from the TV show. So Bolt is not really a dog actor, in the TV show his enemy is Dr. Calico who has two cats that does know they are part of a TV show so the basic stuff is funny, the two cats, one white and another black, have some fun. In the TV show the happy ending is always there, Bolt always saves the day, he always saves Penny and since Bolt really believes he has powers and stuff the filming goes always as planned. What happens when the ending is not happy? Bolt is worried, for him Penny is in real danger, he will be out of the studio, he will see the world. Is a great thing the character Rhino since with him now we have in Bolt a character that believes that he has all the powers and stuff of the character that he plays in the TV show and in Rhino a character that believes that the TV show is real. So Bolt will learn to be like a normal dog, certainly he never acted. The film has a message, is very entertaining, looks really nice, has those hilarious pigeons, I liked it, really liked it."
142,Bolt,10,21 January 2009,best CGI movie i've ever seen...,"I really miss the classic 2D animated movies, but Bolt is without a doubt the best CGI movie I have ever seen. I did enjoy some other well done CGI movies like Finding Nemo, but none have ever really intrigued me as much as Bolt did.When I first watched the trailer, I have to say I wasn't totally excited to see it. After hearing a lot of great things about it though, I decided I should give it a chance, and I am SOOOOO glad I did.Being a teenager who doesn't find any interest in doing the typical things teenagers do, I am trying to be a kid for as long as I can and great animated movies like Bolt really help because it enabled me to feel the things I felt when I watched great movies like The Lion King. I laughed, I cried, and I wish more people would have seen this instead of Wall-E, which I did enjoy but I have no desire to see it again (I personally prefer the animated movies with talking animals because that would be a dream come true for me). There hasn't been many CGI movies with talking animals, which is probably why I still like to repeatedly watch the classics like Bambi, Lady and the Tramp, The Fox and the Hound, Oliver and Company, The Lion King, etc. I can watch Bolt over and over again, and never get tired of it. Bolt, Mittens, and Rhino are SO easy to love and are all awesome characters; every minute of this movie is pure entertainment. If more CGI films like Bolt come out in the future, I certainly won't hesitate to see them."
143,Bolt,8,15 January 2009,A very good animated movie,"First of all I must admit that I don't like to watch animated movies. I saw this movie because my friend gave me the CD. I didn't watch the movie for about 4 days but after that I was getting bored and I had nothing to do at home so I decided to see the movie. When I saw the first 5 minutes of the movie I was amazed that an animated movie can be this exiting. Action sequence that came in first 5 minutes of the movie they were brilliant. But when the scene ended with the super bark of BOLT I felt O Yeah this is another animated film where super dog will save the master from the evil every time she is in danger. But it wasn't like another child film. Then story twisted and we realize that the dog thinks situation is real but it is not real and he is a part of action show where he was made to think that situation is real. This I must admit was unpredictable. Now situation changes and he realizes that he is not a super dog and than he goes through the situations and then it's a happy ending. I must admit that I had not expected this movie to be as good as it is. This movie is fun. Story was brilliant. (Thank god it was not a routine animated film about a super dog). The story had unpredicted twists and turns. It also had humor which was very light and something that was worth of laughing at. Especially the Rhino was fantastic with some of his punch lines. Pigeons were also great when they came on the screen. I also liked the character of Mittens; the cat. The cast of voices is very good featuring John Travolta as Bolt, Miley Cyrus as Penny, Susie Essman as Mittens and Mark Walton as Rhino. Animation was also good that you expect from Walt Disney pictures. This movie will won hearts of the children but adults will spend a really good time too. So overall this movie is pretty enjoyable and fun. Just watch this movie and you will be entertained for hour and a half. Now I will hope to see many more animated movies. Thanks BOLT My Rating  8/10"
144,Bolt,1,8 January 2009,"bad movie, run away","i personally did not see the big deal with this movie. i like fell asleep then left the theater.i think this movie had something to do with a dog and a girl and dog gets lost or whatever, i don't know i fell asleep. i swear I'm never going to let my friends pull me into seeing another Disney movie again. i thought the plot was cheesy and stupid. all though kids under 8 will like it. teenagers will hate it. i liked the incredible movie or what ever but this was just badthe good about this movie was it had a plot (other than a lot of other movies i see. it had a cute little dog in it that about sums it up"
145,Bolt,6,16 January 2009,Just another cartoon...,"OK... so I am not one to go to the cinema to watch animation films and I really am against this trend of paying ransom money to hear the voices of so-called superstars but there was nothing else at the time and so I had no choice ! There are some cartoons that I have liked...oldies like Lady and the Tramp or Watership Down... and sorry to say this is simply not in the same class.The story is fairly good, but all a bit too far fetched, and it all ends too simply and easily.It is fairly good but not a great and rather over-rated. Good to watch at home but I would nt bother going to the cinema for it unless one is into that sort of thing."
146,Bolt,3,12 September 2014,"A fuzzy, white nightmare","Oh, where to begin? I remember how excited I was when Bolt hit the theaters in Canada, during the early 6th grade. I was into dogs then, in the phase when I saw them as more than just big, dumb animals, and I saw an ad in a magazine for a film about a dog with superpowers... I saved up all my allowance, shoveled driveways, delivered groceries, and then I went to the movies to see Bolt...MILEY CYRUS!? Ugh, two minutes into the film and already I thought it was cheesy and annoying. And that's no opinion from an adult reviewer, this was me when I was the target age! I wasn't the only one, when it reached the Hitler-like cat and his fat sidekick, both parents and their children were getting up to leave. I stuck around, thinking it might improve... not a bit! Miley Cyrus' (Penny's) obese mom is introduced, as is a fat hamster, a stray cat with a misshapen head and then this utterly stupid scene where Bolt makes a strange face with alien eyes in a trailer park came up. Towards the end I think I was ready to burn down the theater it was so bad! Not only was Miley Cyrus in it, but the soundtrack was unbelievably terrible, nearly every voice was nerve-wrecking and there was too much of that puppy-love crud that makes dogs out to be these intelligent creatures.It might be an alright movie if you're two years old... but I'm sorry, I just didn't see the interest, and I feel worried for society seeing its current amazing reviews."
147,Bolt,7,7 February 2012,Disney flick - not bad,"I have been anticipating the release of Bolt for several months. I had an opportunity to see a screening of it and it exceeded all my expectations. Bolt is a wonderful movie with a good story and heart, something that Pixar has done well but Disney has struggled with. I believe the addition of John Lasseter to Disney Animation has made a significant impact on the quality and continuity of this film. Yes, it is CGI. You may ask, ""Why is Disney doing CGI when Pixar already does?"" All the studios are doing CGI right now. I have been very impressed with Pixar's CGI detail, however the detail in Bolt is even better. Creating a dog with fur that gets dirty, wet, wind-blown and looks real is very impressive (at least it is to me). In addition to better detail, the color and light of this film is so true to life, you'll think it's the real thing.I laughed, cried, and was on the edge of my seat. Disney has created some lovable characters who will definitely win the hearts of millions. Congrats to the entire Disney Animation studio, well done."
148,Bolt,6,1 January 2012,"Children will love it, but adults will grow tired of Bolt's clichés","Bolt is a slightly-better-than-average film (at least for its time). It will almost certainly be loved by children - they'll enjoy all the action and the storyline - so I recommend watching it as a family if you get the chance.But adults - at least those not part of the 'feed me entertainment' crowd, will grow tired of the predictable plot. I soon became bored of the dull speech and could have written down what was going to happen, after watching a dozen other Disney films.The only really well made part of the film was the animation itself, which, apart from a few continuity errors which you would've thought would've been noticed, was very good and pleasing to watch.You probably won't enjoy watching Bolt, but I would recommend to any child under 10."
149,Bolt,8,21 December 2010,A lot of Fun,"Bolt isn't the greatest movie in Disney's animated Library, but I can say that it's in my top 20, maybe in my top 10.The plot is standard. A dog is led to believe that the life he lives on his TV show is real, but once he escapes into the real world, he becomes like a fish out of water. He doesn't understand how the real world works, he doesn't know why he doesn't have his powers, and he is in desperate need to find his owner Penny. Along the way he teams up with an alley cat named Mittens, and a hampster Rhino who also happens to be Bolt's number one fan. Back at the studio, the producer is trying to find a replacement for Bolt, but Penny still believes he's alive and will make his way back.It's trite, but it's fun. It has some great animation, fun action scenes, and some very funny moments."
150,Bolt,7,4 November 2010,Another very good animation flick,"This movie had some pretty gushy moments and a rather predictable ending, but overall, I thought it was very good and can be enjoyed by the whole family.Rhino the obese hamster steals the show in my opinion. He is absolutely hilarious. The pigeons in the city are also quite funny. John Travolta lends his voice to the main character (Bolt) and he does a nice job. I guess it was a good thing that I didn't even know it was him right away. The characters integrate into the plot nicely and the action is fast-paced without rushing anything. There is some exciting cartoon action sequences that can only be pulled off by computer animation that will keep the kids excited and the drama high."
151,Bolt,7,20 June 2010,Charming tale about the loyalty of man's best friend.,"We've been CGI spoiled lately i think, Wall-E with it's touching love story and climate change undertones then Ratatouillie with it's charming characters...i think this has made us lose focus on traditional animated films, after all if toy story was released right now what kind of critical reception would it get???? fact is, an animated film shouldn't have to say something about us as a society and it shouldn't have to have something for adults (shrek), it should sometimes just be what it is, a darn good yarn.Bolt is not from Disney Pixar by the way, so don't expect dizzying brilliance from it cos although it is good it's not up to the legendary studio's standards.John Travolta voices the lead character who believes himself to be a super-powered dog charged with protecting his owner - Penny, Miley Cyrus.Through misfortune Bolt ends up at the other side of the country, as he believes himself to have superpowers he thinks that the ""green eyed man"" (villain in the TV show Bolt stars in) is responsible for his predicament and immediately sets off to rescue Penny.Encountering a cat that thinks he's insane and a fat hamster that is just as deluded as Bolt, together the 3 travel across the country and face various challenges and life lessons together.The soundtrack is great and the animation superb.this is well worth a watch but not if you're expecting it to be more than it is."
152,Bolt,8,19 June 2010,A super cute movie for all.,"i just loved the interesting plot,and all the main characters in this flawless movie; Firstly, the attraction of having Travolta's voice for Bolt is a good reason, and just like Murphy as the donkey in Shrek is an endearing character, Travolta's voice for Bolt is equally fitting. Animation, editing,and the flow of events is superbly handled. Those three pigeons are unforgettable. what an observation of their body language ! The dialogs are full of wit and humor . How ever, like other animation movies, this one too, could have had some musical scores to it, and shouldn't have ended with just one last number. i have given eight on ten, as i feel that the humans in the movie were not given adequate attention. and were more like caricatures, except for Penny , the little girl of the show, and her parents, especially her father."
153,Bolt,8,20 July 2009,A Cute Film The Kids Will Enjoy.,"The dog of a big television show thinks everything he is doing is real, until he escapes ""by accident"" and is shipped far away to New York. Now he must find his way back to the little girl he loves and protects all while thinking he still has these special powers.The film's animation is nothing spectacular, but will please the little ones. The opening sequence is a scene from the television show, so it's packed with fast paced action and editing. Well done and interesting to see how the incorporated the dog into a superhero fighting everything from guys on motorcycles to helicopters.The story itself is good enough to keep me interested and doesn't really get too stale. It goes through the required clichés of this type of flick, finding out he has no powers, feeling bad and upset, then realizing he still loves the girl and wants to get back to her, blah blah blah. It's all there, so don't expect anything really new in that department.The voice acting is basic, specifically from the leads, Miley Cyrus and John Travolta. Is she in character? Or playing herself? The cat and the hamster steal the show in every scene they are in. Good chemistry between the three characters on their way back to Hollywood, which makes for some good laughs and more toys for the little ones to buy.I can recommend the film because it is entertaining, feels like this years Kung Fu Panda, then again it feels like this years any animated film that isn't Pixar. Give it a look, the inclusion of the cat and hamster characters give it enough of a comedic touch to make it slightly above average."
154,Bolt,6,31 March 2009,Good entertainment if a little complicated,Bolt is surprisingly complex and involving. I expected to take the kids and then sleep but I enjoyed it more than them - the kids are very bright but still found the idea of a superdog who isn't a superdog but still thinks he's a superdog a little too much...However by the time Bolt gets to New York that was all sorted out and they enjoyed the movie - especially Rhino the Hamster who was funny.Good animation throughout and lots of adventure and excitement make this easy viewing (I'm not convinced it is really worth an Oscar nomination though) there is a lot to see and take in but we were surprised at how developed the plot was.All in all a fun movie with some good moments!
155,Bolt,8,23 January 2009,Bolt to see it,"Much like what 'Madagascar' did to penguins, so did 'Bolt' do to pigeons. I already knew I loved the pigeons from the previews, and they didn't disappoint. But unlike the 'Madagascar' penguins, the pigeons weren't the only highlight in 'Bolt.' They were just one of many wonderful things about this great movie (loved the Mittens' mobster scene.) Excellent action sequences (from minute one,) hilarious humor for both kids and adults, a touching story, stunning graphics (finally, a animated and accurate Las Vegas scene) and a die-hard hamster-fan named ""Rhino"" all make 'Bolt' one of the year's best films. Sure, it mirrors Buzz's 'Toy Story' subplot and Jim Carrey's 'Truman Show'  but thankfully they move past that fast. And when they do, when they have the cat, Mittens, teach naïve TV-action hero, Bolt, how to be a regular dog, the movie turns into a tender and hilarious story. In a year that produced some excellent efforts in animated cinema ('Wall-E,' 'Kung Fu Panda' and 'Horton Hears a Who') I'm actually shocked Disney furthered the efforts with a wonderful story so full of action, comedy and heart. The only drawback was the predictability for anyone that's seen this same kind of storyline before, and the over-the-top dangerous finale they put the little girl (Penny  Miley Cyrus) in. Actually, that last complaint actually disturbed me a bit. Yes, we needed Bolt to come back to ""save the day"" in a real and action packed way, but the irresponsibility the TV crew put her in, actually might be a little too much for (some of) the target audience this was meant to be seen. Other than that and as long as it's explained to little ones as fiction/pretend, it absolutely is a must see for adults and little ones."
156,Bolt,7,5 December 2008,"Better than I was expecting. Cute, sometimes touching.","Bolt- The canine star Bolt (John Travolta) of a fictional sci-fi/action show that believes his powers are real embarks on a cross country trek to save his co-star human Penny (Miley Cyrus) from a threat he believes is just as real. Basically it's ""Underdog"" meets ""The Truman Show"", but there is nothing new under the sun, so no sense beating it up for that. I was expecting a snooze fest only palatable for small children, who will delight in this by the way. I was mistaken. Though the premise is shaky, with obvious plot holes as big as you like (Since when do Dogs act?), it's a sweet little movie, and the kids won't care. The humor is pretty broad but there's something for everyone.John Travolta, an actor I haven't liked in quite some time, gives a genuinely cute performance as a young dog coming to grips with reality. Miley Cyrus also gives a decent performance. It's nice to hear Susie Essman (Here playing the cat Mittens) without the trademark F-bombs dropped in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". Who is absolutely wonderful, and I doubt I'm alone on this one, is the little couch potato hamster Rhino (Mark Walton, who has made his career with this). He's an obsessive fanboy of Bolt's TV show, and has such aplomb and over-enthusiasm that he steals every scene he's in, and probably the entire movie too. He's probably my favorite ""side character"" in years.It's a nice film, with decent laughs and some fun action sequences. Once it sheds the convoluted TV show premise the film is allowed the breathe and have more fun. While it's hardly in the ranks of WALL-E, The Incredibles or Ratatouille, it's still a fun movie. B."
157,Bolt,8,23 November 2008,"Surprised me. I was expecting mediocrity, and got real entertainment","99 words or less (okay 110):Like another reviewer, I had seen the trailers and was expecting...not much. One of my daughters insisted on going, and my wife and I drew straws. I lost, so I had to go. Added to that, the show in our local theater was in 3D, a format I have never liked.Imagine my surprise. The plot, though predictable (hey, it's Disney. you are expecting a SAD ending?) was well executed, with interesting characters, good script and storyline and what is becoming the usual: beautifully rendered animation. The 3D glasses looked and felt like slightly polarized sunglasses and the effect enhanced the experience.Go see it. Happy ending and all.I feel better now."
158,Bolt,10,16 March 2009,great entertainment for kids,"Bolt does not have a Shakespearean plot or spectacular twists and turns: it's a simple and straightforward (read: predictable) story. However that doesn't mean the film is bad - quite the opposite! The animation is spectacular, the voices are great, and there are some hysterically funny moments (my favourites being the pigeons). I suppose Bolt was made to appeal to younger (and I mean very young) audiences, hence the complaints by grown-ups here. But you know what, every parent appreciates the fact that films are still being made that appeal to kids and keep them entertained! I took my 3-year-old son (who usually has a very short attention span) to see Bolt in the cinema, and he sat through the entire 90-ish minutes of it and enjoyed it tremendously. So, Bolt may not be Oscar-worthy material, but it fulfils its purpose, which is providing some good uncomplicated fun for the entire family -- and especially for the wee ones."
159,Bolt,10,25 January 2009,"Pixar Comes Up On Top,Again","Within The past 20,plus years since Pixar Studios churned out quality 3D-CGI (three dimensional,computer generated image)animation shorts (starting with a short dealing with computer generated dinosaurs running across a field,up to the release of the celebrated Toy Story features,with a new one down the pipeline), they have made a name for their selves as the Czars of computer animation. Despite a couple of less than celebrated releases,they come out on top again with 'Bolt' (originally planned to be called 'American Dog'), about a little dog (voiced by John Travolta),and his owner,Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus),and their adventures as the stars of a television series. It seems that Bolt thinks he actually has super powers,so when he gets loose & ends up accidentally being mailed to New York,he has to find his way back to Hollywood. He is assisted by a cynical alley cat & a domesticated hamster,on the road. What follows is a series of adventures for the trio. Does Bolt get reunited with Penny? All I can say is, check it out for the answer. This animated film is being released in a special 3D edition,but standard flat,2D prints are also available (for cinemas that lack the equipment for screening 3D films). Rated 'G' by the MPAA (suitable for the whole family)"
160,Bolt,8,27 December 2008,Great film that you will not regret seeing,"Disney did not disappoint with Bolt. The characters were very alive and they all had that Disney quality to them. When you first see Bolt as a puppy you just want to reach in to the screen and hug him. They achieved a very good balance between Bolt the dog and Bolt the character, and maintained that throughout.This was a very action packed movie. In the span of 90 minutes there was more action than most 2 hour action movies. The first 20 minutes of the movie will be remembered by anyone who sees it for decades to come. And they had slower, quieter scenes mixed in there to give you a break every now and then. They timed it very well.I don't like Miley Cyrus but she had such emotion in her voice. I could not believe the level of talent she brought to this movie. You felt the warmth in her heart when she cuddled with Bolt, and the sheer agony when she misses him. I will have to re-evaluate my opinion on Ms. Cyrus now.The animation was just superb. In 3D, it was like you were in the movie, with Bolt, every single step of the way. It made for an incredible ride that was well worth the price of admission. Trust me, you will not regret going to see this movie in 3D. You felt like reaching out and patting Bolt's fur every time! The backdrops when they travel cross country are just jaw dropping. The entire movie is just richly detailed and breathtaking to see. If you are not a kid already, you will most certainly feel like one.This movie had really great moments that have Disney written all over them. Especially the very emotional scene towards the end of the movie, when he studio is burning and Bolt stays with Penny. I nearly cried.But there were drawbacks as well. One, the hamster guy was just annoying. As in Jack Black and Tom Green kind of annoying. They really really overdid how big of a fan he is of Bolt. Then there were the pigeons who kept running the same joke throughout the whole movie. I also felt like this could of been a bit funnier, but mostly it was just that the plot of the film was very very simple and linear and there were no twists or turns. It was a straight arrow.Nonetheless, this was a great film that I would go see again. Miley Cyrus's voice acting was just amazing, I really can't say enough about that (And I have very high standards when it comes to acting). Bolt is an action packed movie about self acceptance and friendship, and it is not to be missed!"
161,Bolt,3,22 November 2009,Not Feeling It,"First I should say I get teary-eyed every time I watch ""Wall-E"" - so I know good animated movies. This movie is just not getting me very interested (watching it now and soon to turn it off). It was cute in the beginning as the dog's behaviors were really cute in mimicking an actual dog. Then, once the plot became clear and the dog's voice (which doesn't fit as others have stated) was revealed, the movie went down hill. I don't understand how people can say this is funny. It just goes to show that people really don't think and/or aren't honest and say things are good because they SHOULD be good (being a cartoon). It's almost like people force themselves to like things. It shouldn't be hard to like things - it should be natural. But this cartoon/movie just really isn't good. It has potential (or should I say had), but it just isn't (enough). I heard of this movie before, but now I see why it wasn't a blockbuster. I'd be surprised if it made $45 Million. I'll look that up now and then I'm done with ""Bolt"". 3 for animation but a plot that was doomed to failure as well as weak anthropomorphic screenplay. I just don't care about these characters...even as someone willing to make the imaginary stretch (as we do when we watch any movie - animation or otherwise)."
162,Bolt,6,16 August 2009,O.D. on QT.,"If cuteness ever becomes a sin, this movie is going straight to hell.BOLT (voiced by John Travolta) is a little white puppy that was raised from birth as a superdog. Well, he's not really a superdog - but HE doesn't know that. For the sake of realistic reactions from Bolt, the producers of his weekly television show (where he plays a superdog) don't let him know it is all make-believe.One day, Bolt's ""person,"" Penny (Miley Cyrus), is kidnapped by the villain of the show (Malcolm McDowell) in a cliffhanger episode, and Bolt believes he must save her. So he breaks out of his trailer - and is immediately accidentally mailed to New York, having to trek back across country to find Penny.Along the way, he meets a cat (Susie Essman) whom he takes hostage, and a crazed hamster who idolizes Bolt's superness, Rhino (Mark Walton), who craves the action-adventure so badly, his middle name should be ""Danger."" Bolt must also come to grips with the fact he is not super, and that he is replaceable on the show, and there's the tear-jerking cliché just waiting to happen.For laughs, BOLT achieves its purpose - but I'm just laughing at the cuteness of everything. Except for the pigeons (yuk! those realistic feathers!).Excellent animation, lots of Hollywood insider gags (James Lipton as The Director, Greg Germann as The Agent, the pigeons pitching episode ideas) and much too much too much cuteness.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."
163,Bolt,7,24 November 2008,"Not exactly a shocker, ""Bolt"" is a great family film","Things haven't exactly been great for Disney animation sans Pixar lately, so while it may be a surprise to you when I say that ""Bolt"" restores some faith to Disney's silver screen products, it shouldn't be a surprise that it was produced by John Lasseter, the man behind Pixar.""Bolt"" is not just some bizarre plot concoction like ""Chicken Little"" or ""Meet the Robinsons"" were. It's an adventure, action and friendship story that works like any good Disney film used to: with heart-warming and lovable characters as well as some silly ones. It appeals to boys with the action, girls with animals and a female human protagonist, and of course enough jokes to keep adults entertained (although this is its weakest area.)Bolt, voiced by John Travolta in sadly his best role in recent memory, is the star of an action TV show, but he's been groomed to believe the world of his show is reality. When producers demand more from the show, the plot has Penny, Disney teen sensation Miley Cyrus (a smart call on Disney's part), Bolt's co-star and owner, kidnapped. Only Bolt believes it's real and escapes into the real world to find her. To make things tough, Bolt gets shipped to New York, across the country. He befriends some critters of course, a cat and a hamster, while learning tough real world lessons on the way.The concept alone is smart when you think about it. Smart at least in the bankable sense. Superhero action movie, combined with animals, combined with an adventure that seeks to reunite two separated friends. It's like rolling ""The Incredibles,"" ""Toy Story"" and ""Homeward Bound"" all together. Genius. The script is really quite genuine and touching, though not as humorous. It's much more geared for families and that's nice to see for once. No serious under-the-radar adult jokes. Perhaps the best line of the movie is one that directly references Pixar's ""Finding Nemo.""Disney plays it safe with ""Bolt."" If Pixar does all the riskier, more unique films, perhaps Disney animation can get away with good old formula stuff. That's definitely okay, especially if they have as much heart as ""Bolt"" does."
164,Bolt,2,4 July 2009,What happened?,"When i saw the first preview for this movie I thought it looked hilarious and cute, I knew right away i wanted to see it and i even told myself it would be worth seeing in theaters. i am happy to inform you i did not waste my money of this movie in theaters i waited until my little brothers bought it then sat down for an hour and a half of boring. all the funny parts were shown in the preview it left me wanting something ... i dunno along the lines of interesting. I thought for sure with this cast and Disney that it would be a true classic for future generations but it fell short of every expectation i had and i could honestly feel my eyes glazing over as i got farther and farther into this horrific movie."
165,Bolt,6,17 March 2017,It was alright. I recommend it for parents to show their kids but nothing really after that,"Plot Overview: ​Bolt, a TV star dog who does not know his TV world is not real, gets shipped across the country and, with new friends, starts a journey back learning life lessons along the way.Directed by Bryon Howard and Chris WilliamsStarring John Travolta, Susie Essman and Mark Walton# No Spoilers!Overall: This movie was alright. I would recommend it to parents who want to rest for 90 minutes but I can't really say I recommend it in any other situation. It's got some nice animation, nice voice acting and a heart warming story but on a whole feels a little empty for me and I can't say it's up to the standard of many Disney and Pixar movies alike.# Possible Spoilers!Good: 1. John Travolta does a pretty good job as the titular character and you really see Bolt grow and evolve over the course of the movie.2. Mark Watney does a fun job as Rhino and Miley Cyrus does a fine job as Penny.3. The star performance, for me, however, was Susie Essman as Mittens, a cynical cat who you grow to love and who grows to love others. Her performance is pretty darn good for just her voice and she properly conveys here character and emotions throughout.4. A nice heartwarming story which works well for the film.5. Nice ending which, in my opinion, ended perfectly.6. Pretty nice animation and music.7. A good number of jokes made me laugh, although I did notice a tendency to gravitate to more childish humour and cringe worthy gags. Humour is subjective, obviously, but I still think it could have catered towards a larger scope because I know people that didn't even laugh once.Bad:1. So much of the story relied on pure luck and was just hard to believe. I'm fine with suspending my disbelief, but there are limits to what I'll let slip by.2. I think that the comedy could have catered to a larger scope and, while I did laugh a few times, I didn't laugh audibly or as much as I hoped. I hate to compare movie but just look at Toy Story, The Iron Giant and Aladdin. Arguably three of the greatest animated movies ever made and in some cases just plain movie. What do all three have in common? They either cater mature themes or have jokes that everyone can laugh at and enjoy.6/10"
166,Bolt,6,17 December 2015,John Travolta is life,"John Travolta plays a dog in this movie. Normally this movie would be nothing special, just a cute little kids film to show your children. But because the dog is voiced by John Travolta himself, that makes the film an absolute must watch for any breathing thing.He truly steals the show in this flick, as he does in every movie he's ever starred in. He enthralls the audience with yet another one of his Oscar worthy performances that movie-goers of future generations can look back at with the same amount of amazement as we do today. The very presence of John Travolta's voice is enough to watch this film at least twenty times a year."
167,Bolt,10,16 December 2010,Even better than Shrek,"I loved this movie from start to finish. It will be an all-time favorite! Everyone loved Shrek and The Incredibles. I might like this one even more. It is absolutely as good, but even better for kids because it was completely clean, with nothing off-color, no adult humor, no disrespectful or rude kids. Shows love, loyalty and tender-heartedness.It's such a pleasure to see a kid's movie that anyone would be comfortable showing to any kid and such a terrific movie to boot! This is one to OWN.If only all Disney movies were this good. It seems Disney learned something from Pixar about kid's animated movies (Keep 'em clean) 10 STARS!"
168,Bolt,,16 April 2010,Lasseter goes to Disney,"""The Truman Show"" meets ""Toy Story"", ""Bolt"" is a fun animated film about a dog who, believing himself to be a superhero, goes on a quest to rescue his owner from exploitative Hollywood pencil pushers. It's a fast paced, fun little flick, more entertaining than Pixar's ""Up"", but lacking the sense of adventure and wonder that made ""Toy Story"" so memorable.This project was started by Disney, but then taken over by Pixar chiefs who reworked the story to better fit the ""Pixar Formula"", which is really just Campbell's ""Hero's Journey"" (some hero leaves his protective environment and discovers a bigger world outside his familiar surroundings) with a Pixar twist. That twist is, the hero chooses to return to the smaller world after learning some message of personal growth or societal revolution. Here the message template is ""Finding Nemo"", the dog learning that he can survive out there in the real world (ocean) and be a hero without having to rely on movie special effects (daddy). It's corny moralising, probably even damaging, but it affects audiences on a primal level all the same.7.9/10  More fun than ""Up"", though I can't see this holding up with repeated viewings."
169,Bolt,9,28 March 2010,One of the greatest Walt Disney films full of comedy,"We got the opportunity to see this in a sneak preview in 3D and were very entertained. Great plot, great animation and the 3D was amazing. Sometimes felt like Bolt's head was towering over the audience. Good thing he didn't drool! All the characters were great. The pigeons were great comic relief. It's amazing the amount of detail the animators put in. Watching the way the pigeons moved their heads was entertaining in itself. Rhino and Mittens were also hilarious while having more depth as well. A lot of Rhino's great lines were in the preview but didn't exactly play out in the story the way they seemed like they were going to. Even with that, he was hilarious. Obviously the plot is predictable but it's a very fun story. We were laughing out loud throughout this movie.Skip Bond and see Bolt."
170,Bolt,10,1 June 2009,A well written animated movie,"We are used to animated movies spreading kindness and happiness among the viewing audience, but Bolt is somehow different. The beginning of the movie is very surprising and the plot unwinds superbly till the end. I enjoyed it a lot, and admired the high quality of everything in it. One of the best scenes in the movie demonstrates the thorough thinking in this movie's preparation: a strong explosion blasts in front of us, and the camera suddenly moves some hundreds of yards away, and we see a Styrofoam glass knocked down very slowly by the blast. It was amazing. The Pixar company has done it again, with the small details that elevate the movie to it's high standards."
171,Bolt,8,26 January 2009,Hilarious,"Well, watched this movie recently at a sneak preview and didn't know anything about the movie. My first thought was ""Oh no, no another crappy animation film..."". 15 Minutes later I was really surprised how funny this ""crappy"" movie actually was, and many people around me laughed their guts out.Well, it's got the same ""true friendship"" moments you might find in every movie of that kind. And also some of those over the top ""this could never happen by chance"" moments. But thanks to the great characters featured, especially Rhino the hamster and the reoccurring pigeons this movie stands out of all those other animation movies featuring some animals on a difficult task. And the ending isn't even that heart-warming as it used to be in that kind of movie. Afterall, great fun for either children or adults, as long as you make it through the first 15 minutes. 8/10 Stars."
172,Bolt,7,18 January 2009,awesome animated,"another great asset to the world of animation, great and easy to follow storyline. voice acting really up to par big names, big fames, and a big surprise. as long as they make these kinds of movie's, i will keep going to the cinema to lay down some bucks for a sweet night full off entertainment. a lot of grown folks action, sweet kiddie story lines and as usual a message of love. not necessarily original nor innovative, but if you know what to expect and it gets delivered in a proper and funny way, i cant really be concern with those details. don't think about it too much and just have a relaxing and refreshing blast."
173,Bolt,8,17 January 2009,its awesome animation...,"Bolt is a beginning of new 3D animation franchise by Walt Disney Pictures. And after watching this I must say I will be happy to see the next part as soon as possible.Bolt is Hollywood's hottest television super dog with super power energy. Unknown by fake studio world one day he entered into real world in search of his partner Penny. He befriends with pigeons, black cat & Rhino- the hamster in a transparent ball to accomplish his mission. Infect, it's Rhino an admiring cute character who made Bolt the real super dog & made impossible possible for an ordinary dog & that's what message is. Rhino is full of fun to watch. It's indeed a nice addition in favorite animated characters. It's coolest animation visual treat with well done voice over from John Travolta & Miley Cyrus. Bolt has something for every audience & it absolutely deserved the praise. As per the one-liner for the film, I would like to go with Rhino who frequently uttered- ""Awesome"".Recommended to all animation lovers.Ratings-8/10"
174,Bolt,8,10 January 2009,"The BEST Disney movie since ""The Incredibles.""","This movie was so much fun to watch! It was like ""Toy Story"" meets ""The Incredibles."" I absolutely loved this film and it kept me laughing and throughly entertained from beginning to end. I can say that without a shadow of a doubt, in my opinion, ""Bolt"" is Disney's best animated film since ""The Incredibles."" The plot was original, the characters were entertaining and funny (especially the hamster), the action scenes and the overall animation was phenomenal, and the movie was just a fun ride. I would recommend this film to people of all ages. It's one of those movies where parents can take their kid(s) to see and they'll both be entertained. If you have kids or you just love Disney movies then you should definitely go see it."
175,Bolt,7,7 January 2009,Fine Family Film about Plucky Pooch,"New Disney animated film that reportedly went through some development problems early in its production finally appears as a kind of unofficial semi-sequel to 2004's THE INCREDIBLES (had that film also included a family superdog), about a young White German Shepherd named Bolt (John Travolta, strongly used during the first hour or so but whose voice largely disappears during the last 20-30 minutes), employed along with his young owner Penny (the ear-popping Miley Cyrus) in the production of outlandish adventures for an unnamed studios' output of media and theme park attractions. When awakened to his contradictory usages by several of the other animal actors at the studio, the little pup goes off on his own by unexpectedly getting shipped to the East Coast and forgotten by everyone except Penny and her mother. Joined by an amusingly smart-mouthed alleycat named Mittens (Susie Essman, whose voicework skillfully displays comic skepticism without becoming one-note or overly hostile) and an overfed TV addicted Ohio hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton), Bolt decides to make his way back home somehow and prove to Penny and the audience that his life matters to what they have asked of him. Slightly longer-than-normal film of its type at first uses the additional material with seemingly traditional cartoon-movie reinforcements like a song midpoint (albeit good) or the moral that money can only exist to ultimately feed business kingdoms and royalty so don't make it do anything else. But alongside these genre tropes directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams inject energizing and inventive elements, particularly through the dedicated verbal character interplay of Bolt and his bizarre animal contacts (including blankly-eyed head-bobbing pigeons and dialog-feeding actor felines), or their encounters with a wide range of human physical types who come off more realistically American proletarian lower-class lifelike than most animated features usually include. In fact much of the film's comedy, starting with Bolt's own unintended myopia during the first half, is so low-key in funnily suspenseful scene transitions and delayed verbal punch lines that the standard animated movie audience may be taken somewhat aback if expecting constantly bawdy SHREK-like pop-media satire or romantically-/matrimonially-angled narrative sideroads (the Disney cartoon epics of the 1990s and 2000s). Like its little hero BOLT instead constantly keeps its head low and quite honest and is all the fresher for it as the little trio charmingly continues through the American Mid- and South-west and Bolt himself steadily learning his own sadness & disappointment can be offset and made palatable as he learns the value of real friendship and a sensible life goal of his own might see him through. Another successful element is the remarkable range of moods and settings the animators create by juggling sunsets, twilights, and light intrusions in shadowy cramped spaces (much of Act II takes place after dark and I was marveling at how the directors and their visual crew were keeping very strong pace through the lower-key nighttime lighting and compositions with the storytelling; when the action literally explodes at an all-night Ohio animal shelter [!] the resulting screams and chaos come off much funnier like a group of real animals and people were all just woken up and startled into disastrous realizations at the same time right at 3am). It all grandly combines near the end when little Bolt returns to LA just as the mourning Penny is involved with the climactic staging of a dangerous epic fire stunt that suddenly goes awry, and joined by his new friends along with the overtaken firefighters descends into the maelstrom to rescue his beloved owner for real and prove to himself and his audience what he's really made of. Its story elements a little creaky, its voice & star-speeching maybe a little too cut off before the final minutes, BOLT does finally combine its' modest strengths together into a rousing ending in the finest Disney way that bodes well for its new Pixar management and the imaginations of children who will find a little canine hero that they can learn from."
176,Bolt,7,5 December 2008,"Bolt, Buzz Lightyear rip-off?","Although the cast of characters didn't seem to be too much of a challenge to create (like how many doggie-kitty movies can you count?)I find Bolt's profile and personality very similar to those of Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series who also believed that he was a hero until Woody talks him out of it saying that ""he's just a toy"". Disney is still contributing to the cliché that ""dogs are dumb, cats are sinister, mischievous creatures and that the hamster is, well just a hamster."" The animation and production are superb but what the story lacks in huge amounts is innovation. Probably because they refuse to take risks anymore like they did in the past. Let's not forget what happened when they launched ""The Wild"" in 2006 shortly after ""Madagascar"" showed up and got obscured in the box office due to its similarities with both the cast of characters and structure. And now they seem like they're following a loop for success imitating other Pixar titles such as ""the Incredibles"" and ""Toy Story"". Hopefully kids will never notice that. But then again I wasn't one of those kids."
177,Bolt,6,29 November 2008,A fulfilling fun film,"Bolt is a fun easy to swallow romp with a soft accessible palate of caricature and lush picture-scape that easily pleases the eyes. It does not boggle the imagination nor is it an exercise in stylistic pacing, comedy, or characterization, but it's a welcome family film without pretension that offers a feel-good adventure that I certainly enjoyed. The film does have a surprising amount of human touch despite the formula and pre-packaged cute that I expected the film to use as its main source of energy. It follows yet another journey (typical of the 'cgi talking animal family film' genre) of a Buzz Light year-esquire white American Shepard with an altered perspective of reality, a notably emaciated cat, and a hamster that derives it's laughs from being a parody of the overzealous fan-boy that says ""Awesome!"" all the time (quite effectively, however). In the film Bolt is actually disturbingly exploited, as he is made to think he and his owner are in actual danger on a consistent basis. One wonder's how his supposed loving owner Penny would be able to take one day of that, but alas it isn't taken so seriously, as it's a premise needed for the film to exist. It was due to this however that I sympathized with his character, and the added lack of humanity came from the fact that Mittens, Bolt's accomplice for the journey, is a stray that once had a home. The emotion in this respect is treated rather typically but it strikes the right chords to teach a valuable lesson which is often absent in films featuring cute dogs and cats. The only main character un-abused by people is Rhino the hamster, who offers much of the comic relief between the confused Shepard and the captive struggling feline. The film is animated well, no shocker there for films from high-end companies like Disney, and the character movements, especially from the pigeons, keep up the spirit of animated zest. There are even some great action sequences; the fake scenes from the TV show (that are featured in the previews like they're the main film) are great as well as the more down to earth scenes. The conclusion's emotions are a tad forced, and a lot of other elements are predictable, but Bolt picks up enough steam and plays with it's situation enough to warrant it's place as a genuinely good animated film."
