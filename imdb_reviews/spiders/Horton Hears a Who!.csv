0,Horton Hears a Who!,9,14 March 2008,"I do like, Sam I am","So far, this is the best possible example of bringing a Dr. Seuss book to life. The animation is top notch and the design of the characters stay true to Dr. Seuss' vision. Overall, a splendid effort from 20th Century Fox.""Horton"" tells the story of an eccentric elephant named Horton (voice of Jim Carrey) who stumbles upon a floating speck that is actually an infinitesimal world that is home to thousands of tiny little creatures called Whos. Though microscopic, the world known as Whoville is a land of technological achievement. The Whos are intelligent little creatures who are strange in appearance.The Major of Whoville (voice of Steve Carell) is the first person to come into contact with Horton after he hears his voice in a drainpipe. Like Horton, he has a somewhat bizarre personality, so no one believes him when he claims that the world is going to end. Likewise, no one believes Horton when he claims that a race of people are living on the diminutive speck.After he is somewhat shunned by his friends and society, Horton sets off on the misadventure of his lifetime to relocate the speck to a safe location so that the citizens of Whoville can live in peace once more.Again, this is a great film for all ages. Kids will lap up the lush animation while parents can have a chuckle at the adult jokes that are scattered throughout. Dr. Seuss would be proud."
1,Horton Hears a Who!,8,21 March 2008,Fast-paced and touching step up for Blue Sky,"I guess it wouldn't be remiss if I've approached ""Horton Hears a Who!"" with some reservations as the trailers were anything but something to be excited about. Had it not been for the Whos and the Dr. Seuss tag that comes with the title, this latest computer-animated film from the ""Ice Age"" team would come off as yet another animal-on-a-mission flick straight from the assembly line. And films adapted from one of Dr. Seuss' books haven't been as successful as when they were in print, to put it lightly.A relatively neutered Jim Carrey provides the voice for Horton, an elephant who hears a voice from a floating speck and discovers that there are people actually living in it in a place called Who-ville. Called the Whos, these people have a Mayor (voiced by an also-neutered Steve Carrell) who has 96 daughters and a son who won't speak. It's up to Horton to find a safe place for the speck to save Who-ville from destruction, even as the well-meaning pachyderm has to avoid all sorts of obstacles, including Sour Kangaroo, Vlad the Vulture, the Wickersham brothers, and other metaphors of McCarthyism.As usual with such a thin material, the film has the obligatory additional scenes to pad the running time but all in all, it captures the spirit of its source, and it's a case where a G-rated film provides entertainment both to kids and their older companions as well. (I would have said ""a rare case"" but in this country, the G-rating is applied more liberally by the local censor board.) The animation is consistently good and a Japanese-inspired traditional animation does not feel out of place from the overall enjoyment material. The voice cast, according to the credits, involves some relatively big names, but other than Carrey and Carrell, none of the actors take attention from their characters and thus do not distract.Fast-paced and touching, ""Horton Hears a Who!"" represents a step up for Blue Sky Studios, who has played supporting roles to Pixar and Dreamworks. I'm tempted to say that it's the best Dr. Seuss film adaptation ever, but that won't be saying much considering the other films involved. So maybe I'll just say it's one of the best animated films, which is anyway true."
2,Horton Hears a Who!,10,14 March 2008,Hilarious!!!!,"I went and saw this movie with my high school drama group, we had recently done Suessical for a school musical and I played the Mayor of Whoville, and I enjoyed the whole thing from start to finish. The cast of this film did an outstanding job with the voices of the characters, Jim Carrey is most notable in my opinion. Steve Carell also did an amazing job as the Mayor of Whoville.It also has good, clean humor that is both funny and suitable for all ages. I laughed through nearly 90% of the film and I didn't see one thing that would be deemed inappropriate for someone young. This movie lives up to the legacy of the book and I don't care what age you are, you will laugh out loud and enjoy this hilarious Dr. Seuss movie."
3,Horton Hears a Who!,10,11 March 2008,"Finally, a film that does justice to one of Dr. Suess's childhood favorites!!","For the first time in years, I can state wholeheartedly that this film is the most faithful adaptation of Dr. Suess's children's books EVER being brought to the big screen with the voice talents of Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, and of course, Carol Burnett. I've never thought that Suess's cartoon illustrations can be so wonderfully spot on in this film with its bright, crisp colors, and flawless animation. What's great about all this is that they expand upon the film, rather than improving it with excess baggage like they did in 2004's live-action flop ""The Cat in The Hat"" which pretty much was ""The Batman & Robin"" adaptation of the classic children's book and I hated that film with an utmost loathsome passion. At least ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" was entertaining in its own right, though I admit it too was a little nauseating; namely because some scenes had so many garishly lit colors and was a bit too over the top. With all that aside, ""Horton Hears a Who"" not only will be the best animated film of the year, but may also win an Oscar for ""Most Faithful Adaptation of a Children's Classic"". I think this film will appeal to children and adults and for those who read the book since childhood not to mention serve as another venue of wholesome family entertainment for the general audience."
4,Horton Hears a Who!,9,14 March 2008,Very cute and so much fun! Dr. Suess would be proud,"I saw the first teaser trailer for Horton Hears a Who a few months ago, and I have to say that it was a little off putting, it looked kind of strange and like it might be another Cat in the Hat lousy movie, but then they started advertising it a little more and it looked more cute. So I decided to check the film out today and I am really impressed, so far I'd say this is the best animated film of 2008 that I've seen. I remember reading the book as a child, it's one of my old time favorite's, you could never go wrong with Dr. Suess. When it comes to his films being put up on the silver screen, excluding the 40 minute cartoon classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas, other films like The Grinch and The Cat in the Hat have been ultimate flops and horrible. But Horton Hears a Who proves otherwise and is a wonderful film to watch.Horton is an elephant just enjoying life, he's a teacher and is loved very much by the little animals of the jungle. But his life is about to change when he sees a little speck and saves it, inside this speck is a little town of Whoville. The mayor of Whoville has asked Horton to take them to a safe place before his town is destroyed. Seems like an easy enough task for Horton, until an angry mother, Kangaroo, feels like Horton and his speck are a bad influence amongst the children, and wishes to destroy the speck and trap Horton.Horton Hears a Who is such a wonderful film. For a book that you can finish in half an hour, they did a great job filling in other lines and such great jokes. The great thing is there is no pop culture or over the top jokes, they just go old school and make this film fun and original. The actors seemed like they just had a great time getting into character, Steve Carell and Jim Carrey are a brilliant combination, so their voices added a lot to the film. The animation was clever and colorful, it was a joy to watch. I very much recommend Horton Hears a Who, it's a terrific family film and just a fun movie to watch for the afternoon, I think Dr. Suess would be very proud too.9/10"
5,Horton Hears a Who!,9,14 March 2008,"Knock knock, whos are there","It's interesting to see a pretty big creature like Horton concerned with protecting the tiniest creatures of all...even if the others in the jungle of Nool may not believe that's he's right about all those tiny people on the speck (well, maybe Rudy, the Sour Kangaroo's son, may think he could be right...)Lovable characters like Horton, who can be serious at times (and is truly determined) but also wild-and-crazy, full of imagination and whimsy. Like the mayor, who is determined to protect his city from the dangers they're now being exposed to (who will protect the protector? ""A giant elephant, up in the sky!... Don't bother to look, he's invisible..."")Had to admit a tear--of joy--rolled down my cheek at the end. Highly recommended! The look of the film is visually stunning, and a good voice cast (CBS Radio's Charles Osgood narrates; the mayor and his wife are Steve Carrell and Amy Poehler, and Jim Carrey of course is Horton. Carol Burnett plays the sour Kangaroo. And Jesse McCartney voices JoJo, and let's just say he didn't have too many lines to remember :)"
6,Horton Hears a Who!,7,5 October 2008,A Person Is a Person No Matter How Small,"In the jungle of Nool, the elephant Horton hears a voice in a speck; he uses a clover to rescue the speck of dust and he makes contact with the Mayor of Whoville. Horton discovers that in that tiny speck there is a city crowded of people and he decides to leave Whoville in a safe place. However, the evil Kangaroo does not believe in his words and finds Horton dangerous for the children of Nool, making them believe in what they can not see, hear or feel, and incites the animals against Horton.With the message ""A Person Is a Person No Matter How Small"", ""Horton Hears a Who!"" is a lesson of respect and rights of the minorities through hilarious situations. The animation is awesome, the characters are nice and I liked this great family entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Horton e o Mundo dos Quem!"" (""Horton and the World of Who!"")"
7,Horton Hears a Who!,8,16 March 2008,Who-larious!,"Dr. Seuss has not always found fortune when making his way from page to screen. But, this latest incarnation is the most who-larious I've ever seen. Get it? Who-larious? Like ""hi-larious"" but with ""who"". As in all the Who's down in Whoville and little Cindy Lou Who? Fine, roll your eyes but you'd be rhyming too if you stopped being so cynical and saw HORTON HEARS A WHO! It's funny; it's goofy; it's surprising and loopy. It's colorful and flashy; it's unexpected and splashy. Wait. Splashy? Is that even a word? I needed something to rhyme with flashy and what I came up with was absurd. Sorry, I promise I won't rhyme all the way through. Besides I'm no match for Dr. You-Know-Who. It's just that this movie is so darn adorable when all the previous Seuss movies have been basically horrible. The spirit of the book remains completely intact but it's modern somehow and as a matter of fact, the ideas have expanded without looking back. Now, thanks to the good folks at Blue Sky, the studio that gave us ICE AGE before this, Dr. Seuss can rest easy, his legacy revered and no longer amiss. So pack up your car, pack up your girl and your boy and bring them to see Horton, a movie the whole family can hmm, what rhymes with ""boy""? Employ? Coy? Toy? Nevermind. Bring them to see Horton, a movie the whole family can appreciate. All that rhyming was mildly exhausting. Let's move on to the intellectualizing portion of this review. When HORTON HEARS A WHO! was originally published in 1954, Dr. Seuss gave his young readers an important lesson about how any voice, no matter how small it may appear to be, can change the world. Screenwriters, Ken Dario and Cinco Paul, have developed the confidence-boosting tale into a much grander take on societal hierarchies, the power of the imagination and the possibility that we are not alone in this universe. The very big elephant, Horton (voiced in a lovably whimsical fashion of fancy by Jim Carrey), randomly finds the tiniest world in the most unexpected of places, a spec of dust that has flown past him to eventually rest comfortably on a clover. It turns out that this world is known as Whoville. It plays home to hundreds if not thousands of Who's and is run by a Who known only as The Mayor. You can only imagine The Mayor's surprise when Horton finally makes contact with him. Now imagine that surprise voiced by the self-deprecating, neurotic genius of Steve Carrell. Together, Carell and Carey play perfectly off each other as their performances are based in the knowledge that Horton and The Mayor are not nearly as different as they initially appear. Though one is huge and one is small, they both know the meaning of responsibility and importance of helping all who need.Of course, back in the Jungle of Nool that Horton calls home, no one believes his story about the people on the spec, so he must go it alone. This would be fine if it weren't for one kangaroo (Carol Burnett), the self-proclaimed ruler of this particular jungle. Horton's flagrant use of his imagination could inspire others and before you know it, all you got is anarchy. And so the door is opened to one of many lessons that give this fable a great richness. While children are not often discouraged to use their imaginations, here they are encouraged to support what they believe to be true inside of their hearts. In doing so, they should even challenge the status quo. Combine that with Horton's perseverance, dedication and loyalty to his cause as well as The Mayor's ability to rally his people together by overcoming his insecurity to become a great leader and you've got a family film focused on promoting fine values instead of promotional products for a refreshing change. The best part is that the lessons never take away from the fun!I know I wouldn't have an easy time if a giant elephant I couldn't see informed me that my whole universe was nothing more than a spec of dust. This is why I'm not in charge of the planet, I suppose. Although slightly less jarring, I was also thrown and most certainly impressed by the existential depth of HORTON HEARS A WHO! Who knew that an animated family flick could challenge the young minds of children the world over to think for second about the fragility and preciousness of life itself while cracking them up non-stop and without freaking them out? Horton knew; that's who!Oh wait  JOY!! Joy rhymes with boy. Right."
8,Horton Hears a Who!,8,10 March 2008,True Telling instead of an Adaptation,"Third time seems to be a charm for the big screen adaptations of Dr. Seuss. Finally, the film world has gotten it write in the presentation of Horton Hears A Who. There is no added surprises to this film, unlike its predecessors The Grinch and The Cat in the Hat. The storyline follows the book almost exactly, with the extra time coming from adding detail instead of adding new events.Jim Carey does a great job in bringing the character of Horton to live, without being completely over the top. Carol Burnett as the Sour Kangaroo brings just enough fright to her role as to not completely darken the story. The characters are brought to live with the pure intent of the Dr. Seuss without seeming fake.This is a great film for kids, especially those who know the story very well. There are enough jokes that sneak over little heads to keep adults entertained as well."
9,Horton Hears a Who!,7,6 March 2008,Very Well Done Film,"I'm telling the truth...i thought this movie would be a stinker from the teaser trailer and TV spots but this surprised me as well as every other person at the screening. It even surprised the film operator! Anyway, the great voice cast voiced by some great actors, Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell and even Seth Rogen(which is a nice change for him, from all his dirty cursing roles(don't get me wrong,i love him in those roles)). Dane Cook was a little annoying, but it wont really distract you from the big picture. In this film, Steve Carrell is the Mayor of Who-Ville, a town on a dandelion full of tiny people. Jim Carrey plays Horton...who is a elephant who finds a dandelion, picks it and figures out he must protect it because of Who-ville. Seth Rogen plays a rat like creature in his role. A supporting cast with Amy Poehler, Jonah Hill, Dan Fogler and much more. This film is great for little kids and a surprising delight for adults."
10,Horton Hears a Who!,6,9 April 2008,"Well, who knew!","There is a world out there that if you haven't heard of it, you're not a kid or never even *been* one. A world of insane imagination and the most creative ideas imaginable, told in the form of wacky but forever appealing poetry-style story-telling. This is the world created by Dr. Seuss, possibly one of the most iconic children's authors of all time. But his stories are in an odd place as of late, as the world of Hollywood looks up to his stories for inspiration on new movie projects. The first one was carried off well (""The Grinch""), but the next one didn't (""The Cat in the Hat"") but there was still something missing to make these adaptations just right and that was to give up doing live-action and do it in animation, where practically anything could happen without as much pressure to make as live-action movies would be so to hear (pun unintentional, title's pun is) about ""Horton Hears a Who"" being an animated production, unlike these two movies, naturally I was very excited to see the end result. Now, I have just yesterday so off I go with a review! The first thing that really struck me with this movie, which is also the best thing about it overall, was the animation. Blue Sky Studios, the people behind the ""Ice Age"" trilogy (third movie in production) are a trustworthy studio when it comes to making some really delightful and appealing pieces of CGI but with ""Horton"", they seem to have outdone even what they themselves thought about their talents! Without exaggeration, the animation is effortlessly stunning through and through and remained absolutely true to Dr. Seuss' playful and appealing drawing style as well as putting in a few new things that don't get in the way. In short, the animation *alone* is a good enough reason to see the movie, hands down.There are added characters in the movie that weren't from the original book but pretty much all of them are not a nuisance and don't get in the way of the storyline so no one should worry, even if a lot of them don't add much. As for the original characters themselves, they are portrayed as they should be and any change to the characters is not easy to notice which is good enough.Original story itself is adapted and carried off well and isn't spoilt by anything else in the movie. The back story of JoJo and the Mayor's relationship can feel a little odd at first but they've managed to blend this well with the original story and it's easy to get used to after a tiny amount of time.The movie's most obvious problem however is that it does tend to focus heavily on humour in a lot of scenes and there are too many jokes that aren't really necessary, a few of them will sadly even date the movie in coming years (I won't say which ones they are here, you have to see for yourself) but thankfully the story manages to stay intact still and besides, there is quite a lot of jokes (that had a purpose) that were really *hilarious* so it's not a total disappointment. As for Jim Carey and Steve Carell? Well, they could have been better but they were good enough for me to say that they were good choices.So overall, ""Horton Hears a Who"" is a good enough effort from Blue Sky Studios and good enough for me to say that it's a decent film. Really could have done without so many unnecessary jokes but the animation and good story adaptation make up for it. Worth checking out! I rate this: 6 out of 10.Eric."
11,Horton Hears a Who!,1,12 April 2008,Seuss would have hated it.,"This movie fell into the same trap as just about every Hollywood animation of the last 6 years. It talks down to the kids while spending too much time throwing zingers over their heads to keep the parents engaged. There's no story told here in any sort of engaging way. It relies on the brightness of the animation, attention deficit editing and over the top scoring to keep the young ones stunned while hitting their parents with soggy hidden adult jokes and nostalgic music. The moral of the story is supposedly that imagination is something to be valued but the story telling on display actually does a horrible job of leaving any room for kids to actually use their own imaginations in engaging with the story. It does more to deaden the complicated sentiments expressed by Seuss so well in the original book. Instead of activating kids' imaginations, this movie simply displays the self satisfied and over saturated imaginations of it's directors and animators. There's literally no room left for the audience in this movie."
12,Horton Hears a Who!,8,14 January 2009,High-Def Really Makes This Come Alive,"There is a stunning difference in watching this animated feature on regular DVD and viewing it on Blu-Ray. The latter dramatically elevates my rating of this movie, because the story is just so-so.It's a nice story, but nothing that will leave you laughing like in ""Cars,"" or ""Madagascar"" or a bunch of other recently-made animated features. However, on Blu-Ray, this is so flat-out awesome to look at, that's is well worth seeing and adding to your movie collection. The brilliant colors and razor-sharp images are just amazing and totally stunning! Jim Carrey does a nice job as ""Horton."" You might not even recognize his voice. He plays a character who hears a voice nobody else hears; the voice of a tiny person on top of flower/weed which is part of a tiny town on the top of that plant. Hey, ""size matters,"" I guess, but far more important is the value of living beings regardless of their size. That's the general message of the story. All lives are worth saving, no matter how supposedly small and allegedly insignificant.The story is the typical frustrating one in which nobody believes the one who is telling the truth, until near the end, and then all of them do the right thing.Overall - a good message, presented in a so-so story but a gorgeous one to watch on Blu-Ray."
13,Horton Hears a Who!,8,18 March 2008,Who Awakening,"Oh, thank goodness, the third time IS the charm. Finally, finally, and finally, Hollywood gives us a movie that actually and perfectly embodies the spirit of Theodor Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss. Criminey crickets! Horton Hears a Who! is wholly imaginative fun that feels like it's channeling the good doctor's playful exuberance and ingenious creativity with every syllable and splotch of animation.The biggest difference between this movie and the recent adaptations of Seuss's The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas is that Horton Hears a Who! was created using CGI animation, not live action, not adults in goofy costumery. And that permits directors Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino to, well, animate a Dr. Seuss book. Part of the charm of Seuss's books was their otherworldly atmosphere, with just a touch of reality thrown in so kids could identify with the characters and underlying themes. And it makes such a wonderful difference! When you throw actors into suits, you take away both the personality of the actor and the appeal of the Seussiverse, if you will. What you're left with is an overproduced, unpleasant mess that tries desperately to be relevant and interesting and fails miserably at both.Anyway, back to this movie. Horton (voiced by Jim Carrey) is an elephant in a world sort of like ours, but not really (as evidenced by the myriad odd creatures inhabiting Horton's jungle). Now, if you've read the books you know that Horton's a bit of what we'd call a free spirit. He has a short attention span, and he's always so hap-hap-happy. The kids in the jungle (er, animal kids) look up to him, sort of as a big plaything (since Horton's an adult, supposedly), and he in turn tries to teach them about the jungle and its mysteries and dangers.Well, one day Horton spots a stray clover floating by on a breeze, and he hears what he believes is a cry for help. Oh, but it's not the clover, it's a speck ON the clover. And way down within the heart of that speck, there's a whole 'nother world, the land of Whoville. Populated by the Whos, of course. And it seems that when the flower became detached from its root, strange things had been afoot in the land of the Whos, like strange cloud formations and odd weather patterns.The mayor of Whoville (voiced by Steve Carell) is a bit of a screw up, a patsy, a boob (in the words of the town's head councilman, voiced by Dan Fogler of Knocked Up); he's in his position to look nice and smile wide. The Mayor has 96 daughters - and one son! - and a lovely wife, and between spending time with them and planning for the Whocentennial, he's worrying about the signs of impending doom he keeps seeing.And then Horton says hello, and those signs become reality. And it's up to Horton to find a safe place for the speck to sit, so that the Whoniverse (see what I did there?) can survive in peace, as it has for centuries. But there's a problem - the other denizens of the jungle, led by Kangaroo (voiced by Carol Burnett, who's apparently alive and well), who believes the speck represents imagination, which she doesn't want the jungle kidlets to have - because then they'll be questioning authority, and we can't have that! (Seuss was quite the subversive.) So Horton races to get the speck to shelter while fending off attacks from monkeys and vultures and whatnot.Carrey is awesome as the childlike Horton, a kind-hearted, if perhaps a bit naive, pachyderm who truly believes in what he cannot see (i.e., the Whos), because he can be wild and spastic and hilarious. I mean, after all, it is a cartoon; characters should be outlandish, not subtly shaded. Carrey's riffing (and ad-libbing, I bet) will remind you of Robin Williams or Eddie Murphy in their signature animated roles - untethered joy and comedy. Steve Carrell is aces as the beleaguered mayor who does believe in Horton's existence, even if no one else does; he has sort of an easygoing flustered personality about him that is the counterbalancing adult to Horton's whimsy.The movie's basically a metaphor for love, frankly. Kangaroo says she does not believe in anything she cannot see or touch, and it's evident that she lives on the fear of the other animals, not on their love. She doesn't even appear to love her own son; she thinks of herself more of a caregiver than a mother. Kids should always mind their parents, no matter how dumb their requests and actions are. So Kangaroo does not believe in the Whos, because she cannot see them, just as she does not believe in love. But of course, since this is an animated movie, all does turn out okay in the end, with Lessons Learned."
14,Horton Hears a Who!,1,19 April 2008,Didn't care for it,"My daughter talked about seeing this movie for weeks before we went to see it, as it is based on two of her favorite Dr. Seuss books - Horton Hears a Who and Horton Hatches an Egg. Unfortunately, they completely twisted the characters around and stuck in too much cinematography and filler and got away from the plot. The jokes were corny and my 4-year-old daughter was visibly bored throughout the whole movie. She has loved the movies we went to see in the past, but she said the movie wasn't anything like the book and wanted to know why Horton acted so crazy in the movie. She didn't let out a smile or a chuckle throughout the entire movie (and neither did I). While I appreciate that the movie wasn't offensive (We made the mistake of suffering through Cat in the Hat), it just didn't successfully stretch out two short children's books into a full-length movie. It sacrificed plot for visual effects and forced jokes and I just didn't find the movie funny, or even entertaining. And, frankly, my daughter likes just about anything, and she didn't enjoy the movie. As she is the target audience of Dr. Seuss books, I found that unfortunate. We'll stick to the books.I know Audrey Geisel loves her late husband, but please stop selling the rights to his works to everyone. That isn't what he stood for."
15,Horton Hears a Who!,1,23 January 2009,Dr. Seuss is not for full-length movies,"Not many books can be successfully made into a 90 minute movie. And this is one of them. Read any Dr. Seuss book. It takes 10 minutes max. The script was heavy-laden with too many gimmicks that were so far off from the original story that they made the movie drone on and on. The original cartoon version was bad enough. This was 3 times as long. Jim Carey once again shows that overacting an animated creature is not his forte. While he is lower key than in the Grinch he was over animating (so to speak) the character of Horton. The only one who captured their book character was Carol Burnett. She played the shrill Kangaroo perfect. Then they had her kid act as a defiant brat and defend Horton. This is not part of the original story, and adds another movie we can chalk up to the liberal Hollywood ideal that kids should always rebel against their parent. The movie sucks, plays too long, and has no characters to embrace. Don't buy it."
16,Horton Hears a Who!,9,15 March 2008,Horton Hears a Who is a Hit!,"I remember when I first saw the commercial for this movie I had absolutely no interest in spending my $8 on a potentially terrible adaptation of a book I loved as I kid. Then I was talking to some friends and one of them sheepishly admitted to wanting to see Horton Hears a Who. It was almost as if a switch was flipped inside of me and I began thinking: ""well, maybe it won't be THAT bad...and I DID love the book."" So when that friend asked if I wanted to see it with him, I said yes...yes I would.Well let me just tell you, the commercially do not do it justice. The previews make it look like it is full of stereotypical jokes and stereotypical characters and, well, I'll admit that they are there, but they're endearing. Yes, I said it! They're endearing! The entire movie was incredibly endearing BUT it was also bizarre and twisted...just like how I remember all Dr. Suess novels as being like.Not only that, but it contained a higher level of understanding that Dr. Suess had in all of his storybooks. You know what I mean...take the Lorax, for example, which dealt with pressing environmental issues cleverly contained in an imaginary world in a children's book. Horton Hears a Who deals with things like anarchy, religion, totalitarianism, existentialism, democracy, and faith. The movie portrays it spotlessly. The movie is emotional and smart and funny. It's not funny all the time for an adult (it IS a kid's movie, after all), but it is clever and completely worth the time and money.Do I recommend it? Heck yes I do!"
17,Horton Hears a Who!,5,3 March 2009,Jim Carrey fans treat with caution!,"The first thing I noticed about the movie was Jim Carrey. All those fantastic scenes from Ace Ventura scrolled through my mind and I laughed pretty hard even before I saw the movie. This, then should be a winner right? WRONG! After the movie I felt like crying. What a waste of time! But then again, let's look at this movie constructively first.If you've got little kids who laugh at bright colors or simple cartoon humor like a monkey jumping up and down, this is the film for you!(well, your kids). The humor seems extremely kiddish and all through the movie Carrey seems held back, not letting his usual insane character rip the script in half. The story line taken from Dr. Seuss' book is nice, ingenious characters, creating a little world that exists on a spec full of wacky technology and even more wacky people. However, the manner in which the cartoon progresses is disappointing. Half the time I kept drawing in my breath waiting to explode out with laughter at some extremely funny Carrey scene, but lo and behold, the air did but seep peacefully out with no laughter to accompany it. The animation and graphics is extremely good, a 10 out of 10 in my opinion and this is what saved the film. To sum things up, the film could be a pleasant day out to the cinemas with your little innocent sweet kids and wife or husband, but PLEASE I do not recommend it for anyone older than 16 who's looking for a funny film to watch."
18,Horton Hears a Who!,7,12 March 2008,A Nutshell Review: Horton Hears a Who!,"I've got to make a mental note that movies that have trailers playing in the cinemas for the longest time, do not a boring movie make, even if the first half of the movie plays like the extended version of the trailer, telling us things we already know, spelling out the premise all over again.Jim Carrey and Steve Carell unite on the big screen again after their short pairing up in Bruce Almighty, although this time they're animated as animals / creatures from Dr Seuss' fictional world. Jim Carrey voices Horton, an elephant who in moments where you least expect, spew lines of poetry as dialogue. We're introduced to his character from the onset, though his backstory isn't really fleshed out, except that there are those (like the Kangaroo) who hates all for what he stands for. And simply put, Horton exudes all qualities typical of what elephants are made out to be - excellent memory, frightened about the unknown, and trustworthiness.These qualities are put to the test when he chances upon a speck on a clover. That speck turns out to be home for an ecosystem populated by Whos, minute creatures who seem to live very mundane, repetitive lives in their very own little paradise. Things start to go awry, especially with severe environmental changes, and despite the Mayor of Whoville (Carell) warning of the great unknown out there, like all predictors of impending doom, get ridiculed by the population. So begins the friendship between HOrton, trying to protect the world of his new found friend by relocating the speck to safe haven, and the Mayor, who must warn his disbelieving population about more dangers to come.For a while it drags on, with childish banter between the two lead characters, and the plot by Horton haters to bring him down by destroying his toy of the moment, not acknowledging his mantra that a person's a person, no matter how small. They want proof, and they're not getting any, since the Whos are also laughing at the fact that there are bigger creatures out there, outside the realms of their known atmosphere. It's as if one's trying to convince a large group of atheist that there is a supreme being up there and he's up there watching our every move (ok, so Horton doesn't actually get to see them, but you get my drift).But the struggling with existentialism, is what made Horton Hears a Who shine brightly, and made the ticket worthwhile. A pity we have to really wait out for it, but at least these tense moments came, better late than never, that really brought out enough drama and excitement that I never saw coming my way. Otherwise, the animation's pretty standard fare in 2D, and chock full of supporting characters (voiced by Seth Rogen, Carol Burnett, Dan Fogler, Isla Fisher, Amy Poehler and Jaime Pressly et al) just to ramp up the cute factor, without giving them much to do anyway, though I must admit the gorillas almost always crack me up (you should see what they can do with their bananas!)Smart to debut this during the school holidays this week to catch hold of school going kids. Oh, and get yourself into the hall early as you'll get to see Ice Age's Scrat up to his antics to promote Ice Age 3, due on in Summer 2009 (yes, 2009!)"
19,Horton Hears a Who!,5,17 March 2008,Who would've thunk?,"Unlike many Dr. Seuss Nazis, I wasn't about to have a conniption if Blue Sky's ""Horton Hears a Who"" wasn't 100 percent faithful to the source material, but only if it were able to develop an actual idea and personality all its own. Of course, I'd have to visit the twilight zone to observe any innovation of that sort that isn't wretched and vile such as the likes of ""The Cat in the Hat"". Shockingly, this bland little inoffensive children's flick was the first modern Seuss remake I've seen that didn't apply gross out humor or reprehensible scenes that shouldn't be shown to people under age 12 (actually, to anyone with cognitive brain functioning). This is clearly evident in that it differed from the hard hitting and uninspired gags like those in the Ice Age films and settled for a warm almost verbatim cgi recreation of the classic children's tale, sexism and all. The animation is passable, lacking any interesting exercise of the medium. It has nice color scheme and basically everything else it needs to satisfy the most tightly-wound fans of the original story. That being said, the film becomes nothing more than it's source material. The characters lack dimension, and the film as a whole remains flat, only given any sense of character from Suess' mind. The films occasional meanderings include an overly long Japanese anime spoof, funny in its own right but adding nothing but confusion to the rest of the film's content. The message of the movie is certainly welcome, whether you're simple enough to hijack a nice children's story to tout anti abortion ideas, or if you want to take from it what a small child would; to care about others despite their differences, status, or what other people may think about them. It's all the magic of what makes the books so enticing. Perhaps it's even effective enough to pose the first pieces of philosophical ideas in youngsters. Aside from all that, it's a fun film and moderately tolerable for those the kids drag along. It really should be questioned however if four years of labor and expense should only come to this. Truthfully, even though none of these Seuss films really do it for me cinematically, this was one of better ones."
20,Horton Hears a Who!,9,11 April 2008,a very well done Dr. Seuss adaptation,"after living through the travesty that was the live action adaptation of The Cat in the Hat,i wasn't sure what to expect.this movie is not live action,which is a plus.i was pleasantly surprised by it.it's actually clean wholesome fun the whole family can enjoy.there's a little action and adventure,and a lot of comedy.the movie is also touching.it also has a message,that basically says,we're all significant and we all deserve to be treated equal.it's not heavy handed at all.in fact,i thought it was quite subtle.i also liked the voice cast.Jim Carrey was very good as Horton,Steve Carell was also good as his mouse friend,and Carol Burnett as the Kangaroo who rules the forest was also good.parents,this is a movie you can take your kids to(and enjoy yourself)without worrying if there is anything that is not appropriate."
21,Horton Hears a Who!,6,30 March 2008,Some of the best animated madness is mixed with some of the blandest,"Beautifully animated retelling of the Dr Suess tale of Horton the elephant finding the speck of dust where Whoville resides and then having to protect it from danger. As good as the film looks its an uneven affair. Brilliant set pieces (anime homage) and jokes (monkeys stuffing bananas in their mouths) are followed by exposition and bits that confuse humor with busy action. Despite or because of some of the best cartoon jokes in years the film still disappointed me- how could a film that is capable of such cleverness so often miss the mark? Okay it doesn't miss the mark so much as be be dull (or not live up to the mark the good stuff sets for itself). Half way in I was annoyed enough to want to leave. The one thing that doesn't disappoint is the voice cast with Jim Carrey fine and not too silly as Horton, Steve Carrell as the Mayor quite good, Carol Burnett evil as the Kangaroo and Charles Osgood wonderful as the narrator.Worth a look at some point...probably on DVD or cable."
22,Horton Hears a Who!,8,31 March 2008,A solid seussian movie,"Theodore Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, is no stranger to the Hollywood treatment of his books. It started in 200 with Ron Howard's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" and was followed by Mike Myers starring in ""The Cat in the Hat."" Both of those films were live action, but this most recent adaptation of ""Horton Hears a Who!"" has dipped into the ever expanding realm of computer animation. Blue Sky Studios is helming the animation on this picture, most notably known for their ""Ice Age"" movies.The classic Seussian tale begins with an elephant named Horton (voiced by Jim Carrey) who decides it's too hot and that he wants to get cool. So he decides to go swimming in a pool in the jungle of Nool (If I could write my whole review in rhyme, I would). While cleansing himself, a tiny speck floats by Horton's ear and he hears voices yelling. Horton, convinced that there are people on the speck, rushes to save it from landing in the water by catching it on a clover. All the while, the rest of the jungle thinks Horton is crazy, but nobody more than the big bad Kangaroo (Carol Burnett) whose mission becomes to destroy the clover ""for the children!"" Meanwhile, Horton is right about the speck and inside the tiny dust ball is a town named Whoville that's four sizes as small. Horton speaks with the mayor of Whoville (Steve Carrell) and together they decide that the speck needs to reach a safe and stable place at the top of Mount Nool or Whoville will be destroyed.Perhaps what was most surprising about the film was the number of styles and animation that co-directors Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino were willing to explore. For instance, the jungle of Nool has a warm, cartoony, otherworldly feel to it while the town of Whoville is undoubtedly Seussian. There is also a sequence that is animated in 2-D in the same style that the original Seuss books were (think Cat in the Hat) and another sequence that does a hilariously good job of imitating Japanese anime. Most importantly though, is that the shifts never get in the way of the story.Speaking of animation, it seems that computer animated stories have finally reached a point past the 'wow' factor and the computer doodles don't have to become more important than the story. The animation was great. It was rich and textured and in the opening scene the water that Horton swims in looks incredibly real. The water, however, is about the only thing that looks real, which is a good thing. The mistake that the live action Seuss films have made is that they tried to recreate the world of Dr. Seuss with tangible sets and it never quite felt like Seuss but it never quite felt like anything at all. It was a blah attempt at a world that was meant to live in imaginations. Luckily for the audience of ""Horton,"" Blue Sky has a grip on what they wanted visually from the story and the beauty of computer animation is that everything that is seen on screen is amazingly calculated and detailed.I also wanted to briefly note that the score composed by John Powell was great (save for an unfitting song at the end). I got really excited when, during the climax, Powell most certainly was aiming to score a song similar to Ennio Morricone's ""Ecstasy of Gold."" That song is famously known for playing during the climax of Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" It was a nice homage to the spaghetti westerns.What irked me most about the film, however, was the sometimes over-the-top acting of Carrey and Carell. They are both comic powerhouses, for sure, but there's something about voice acting improvisation by both of them that doesn't carry over into animation. Perhaps it's because the spontaneity of it gets lost in the technicality of animating it. At any case, the voice acting was nothing short of superb. Besides Carrey and Carell sometimes getting lost in trying to be funny, the supporting cast delivered wonderfully. Carol Burnett reminded me of every overbearing mom that I've been unlucky to overhear (""Horton is teaching the kids to use their imagination!""). The smaller characters are littered with celebrities: Will Arnett, Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, Isla Fisher, Jaime Pressly, and Amy Poehler, to name a few. It's unfortunate that many of their roles are fairly small, especially Arnett as the bounty hunter vulture, Vlad.""Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!"" is a movie that was surprisingly good. Blue Sky Studios certainly brought out a film that can rival what Pixar (Finding Nemo, Toy Story) has been doing for years. ""Horton"" was visually exciting, featured an astounding cast of voice actors, and was faithful to the world of Dr. Seuss. It's a cliché, I know, but it truly is a film that can be enjoyed by all ages if you're willing to let yourself emerge into a Seussian wonderland. So go to the theatre and get a quick ticket, and if you see a speck of dust, don't you dare flick it. Because as Horton would say, to one and to all, ""a person is a person, no matter how small."""
23,Horton Hears a Who!,8,23 March 2008,so perfect if only....,"yeah..if only the last singing part(don't wanna lose this feeling or something) would not have appeared!!!!! everything was perfect; all the actors did a great job(especially the major) this had its own funny characters(Katie!) the world of who ville was amazing(i wish i could have seen more of it though...) the anime part was hilarious!!! such a rip-off!!! when the movie had the ""drama/sad love"" moments i didn't feel embarrassed for them, i actually felt sad! (unlike i did in ice age...O__o) i cant even remember the last time I've actually laugh my ass off while watching a animated kids movie, the bridge part still makes me loll! in the end the music every who made was just awesome!!! i was just wow...this is totally good....until they started singing. i was like..OK..what? this is a Little bit overdone...and then the credits came, with them still making faces, like you just couldn't get enough of them. and..thats what happened. i still feel there is something i wanted out of the movie...yeah, the world of who's and the relationship between Jojo and Ned(the major). thats what i wanted to see more about...overall, a perfect must-see on cinema movie! (the animation and the world of who's is just something you cant miss on the big screen.) OH YEAH AND ONE BLOOPER!!! (or at least i think so....spoiler!!) when the flover falls, and hits the ground, the world of who's crashes. its a very good and exiting scene cuz it leaves me vondering if they are still alive..but when Horton finds the speck, they are all OK, with no injuries whatsoever..maybe the time it took for Horton to find them was enough for them to recover and built up their little destroyed town... i mean, they are who's after all. ;)"
24,Horton Hears a Who!,,22 March 2008,Horton hears a who,"Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey doing voices for an animated film, now that is just amazing! During the entire movie you could feel the emotion and you almost saw Jim Carrey's face as he spoke. A 7/10 I reckon this is going to be a classic!For the movie itself as i said before putting Carrey and Carrell was a great idea. The effect evident in this movie through their collaboration was absolute,infinite, dynamite!! For those of you out there who think that because of the bright,colourful colours this film is for kids well boy are you wrong. You will laugh until you vomit. I was literally rolling around and vibrating in my seat the entire time and was shot concerned looks across the cinema. In conclusion this film could be bigger than ""How the Grinch stole Christmas"""
25,Horton Hears a Who!,1,21 April 2008,Ugh! Don't waste time or money on this.,"OK, i don't know why this hasn't come in the eye of most people, but i was very disturbed at the unapologetic chauvinistic track of the movie. The Whoville Mayor has 96 daughters and one son. And yet, who'll take over the Mayorhood after him is never even debated or discussed. It's a given that the 'boy' is heir to Mayorhood while the girls play or fight with each other over who stole their hairbrush. Is this really 2008? Made me barf. Even apart from this track, we've seen better stories and animations to tolerate this one. I want my spent time and money baaack!Read this link by a disgusted father as well -- http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89318829"
26,Horton Hears a Who!,1,18 April 2008,Manipulative and Politically Correct,"Several years ago I saw a movie called ""Pleasantville"" starring Tobey McGuire and Reese Witherspoon. The plot masqueraded under the guise of poking fun at the values of the 50's. In reality, it was a very thinly veiled attack on the values of the 50's, the Nuclear Family, Protestant work ethic, sexual purity, etc.""Horton Hears a Who"" fits into that category of movies whereby the producers clearly sought to put forward a political message. And this one, rated G, will wash over kids and parents alike, especially if their antennas are not up.The antagonist is played by Carol Burnett; she is the voice of the Kangaroo. She ""pouch schools"" her hapless son, and seeks to control the jungle. She is narrow minded, mean spirited, stupid, arrogant, and ultimately in favor of destroying a tiny civilization. And this destructive behavior is clearly related to her narrow minded hypocrisy.Horton (voice by Jim Carey), on the other hand, is a free spirited, open minded learner. He encounters a tiny civilization living inside a tiny speck perched upon a clover. He realizes that there is life to be protected and valued. Mrs. Kangaroo (Carol Burnett) gets wind of Horton's discovery. She is clearly very intimidated and NOT happy with a possible change in the status quo of the jungle, or any other thing that could mean imagination, new discoveries, enlightenment or a loss of control. The entire movie chronicles Mrs. Kangaroo's efforts to destroy Horton, his speck and a tiny civilization.For you home-schoolers out there, the parallels are stark and unmistakable. For people of faith the same is true. I felt violated because I entrusted my children to the Motion Picture makers of America who rated this movie ""G"". This movie should have been rated ""PC"", for Political Correctness. There were simply too many societal and political parallels and innuendo to ignore. Both my wife and I hated the movie, as my kids were subjected to a cunning, adroit and intentional form of brainwashing. If I thought I could get a refund for this horror show, I'd ask for one."
27,Horton Hears a Who!,4,17 February 2009,The book was better...,"Never, ever fails to amaze me when someone whose writing credentials can be writ on the head of a pin (with room to spare) tries to ""adapt"" a book to The Big Screen; to ""adapt,"" one must be ""adept."" At writing. You with me on this so far? Let's take, as an example, Richard Matheson's excellent end-of-the-world shocker, I AM LEGEND. Three times, now, it's been ""adapted."" Not once correctly. Three times at bat, filmmakers have tried to ""rethink"" Matheson's masterpiece- and failed miserably, this last time being (all things considered) the worst of the lot. (Why worst of the lot, you ask? Because they had more than enough money to do it right- unlike the first time, when the filmmakers were forced to literally leave the country to find a place where it could be shot for ****s and giggles, or the second time, when a pair of writers who should've known better tried to ""rethink"" the story. And it was this ""rethought"" version the makers of #3 drew on when they lensed their loser.) I've wandered afield a bit, here. We're not talking about a novel, nor even a ""real book."" We're talking about a poem with pictures. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I happen to love SHREK: Rufus Wainwright's show-stopping rendition of Leonard Cohen's haunting HALLELUJAH still gives me chills when I hear it- and the second installment is just as good, in its own right. As are the two TOY STORYs (the second of these being my favorite). Disney's PINOCCHIO is a work of art; as is LADY AND THE TRAMP. WALLACE AND GROMIT, THE PJs, CAPTAIN SCARLET (the original series; I've yet to see the second). HOODWINKED was entertaining. So was ROBOTS. But HORTON HEARS A WHO is so chock full of banal, clichéd, unfunny prat falls and ""contradictory"" lines that it's hard to imagine anyone finding it even mildly amusing."
28,Horton Hears a Who!,,21 March 2008,Anime on a Speck,"You will probably not like this for the simple reason that as a movie it could never stand as far above other movies as it does as a book above other books.Even among Seuss books it is a sort of marvel. Its structure is such that it balances a story where the point is belief in an invisible deity, with a story about intolerant believes. Its spirit and inquisition and seeing it today, I imagined the great, great divide in my city.You see, we have radical Christian fundamentalists, the kind that belief in intelligent design. And we have.. Let's say, folks who are sensitized to intolerance. I imagine both of these will go home thinking this story was written for them.Its a marvelous creation that way: a story about two worlds, balanced between two worlds.Alas, it lacked oompf, except for two things. One was the inclusion of an impression and quote from JFK. It really had power and almost became the center of the thing.The other thing was a matter of enlightened film-making, a technique which I call folding. How do you make a cartoon seem closer to reality? Especially a cartoon whose form is inflexibly fantastic because it has to copy the book.Why, you do that by inserting another cartoon in it, one that follows Ted's law, the law that the fold within has to be the same level of abstraction down as the containing film is from the viewer's world. That's what we have here, a sort of parody of Japanese anime. Its amazingly well chosen and does what is intended.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
29,Horton Hears a Who!,6,16 March 2008,A lot better than the previous Dr. Suess',I didn't like the Grinch or the Cat in the hat probably because they were live action and didn't do justice to the animated versions. I liked the movie and it was probably more fun for adults than children. A lot of jokes were well over their heads. It also was slow in parts and didn't seem to have anything that would resonate with small children. I took my four year grandson and he got fidgety about halfway. I have to say the animation was great. They really did a great job with the colors and Horton. Whoville was great too but we really didn't get a sense of the people of Whoville or JoJo who is such an important character in the book. Last I have to say the I agree with the critics the ending musical number was totally wrong. 6/10
30,Horton Hears a Who!,9,16 March 2008,Best Dr Seus adaptation to date,"I'll be honest, I was never really raised on the Dr Seuss, in fact with the notable exception of How the Grinch Stole Christmas and The Cat in the Hat, I have never read any of the Dr Seuss books. However, what I have had the misfortune of seeing are the two live action adaptations of his beloved books. The Grinch, starring Jim Carrey, was admittedly a mixture of brilliance and sheer nastiness. Carrey was inspired casting, and the film did look brilliant, but the horrendous songs and the annoying lead girl just made me want to vomit. And then a few years later something truly horrendous arrived, The Cat in the Hat. The movie adaptation of the book left me dumbfounded. In fact if I had been younger I am pretty sure the movie would have traumatised me for life. Mike Myers sinister as hell interpretation of the Cat and the bright colours, oh it was a monstrosity of a movie. Thankfully Horton Hears A Who has come along to completely eradicate these past memories. Horton is a bit different, as it is an animated adaptation, but the movie works so well for being beautifully shot, brilliantly scripted, and genuinely funny. However the movie also is very touching as well. The voice cast are superb, Jim Carrey fits right at home as Horton and Steve Carrell is suitably manic as the Mayor. The animation, while not up to Pixar's standard, is beautiful. The bright colours are a joy to watch and the manicness of the humour makes the film a hoot. Sure the film has faults, much like Bluesky's past three movies (Ice Age 1 and 2, Robots) the movie hits slow ground in the middle and does strain for laughs, but the superb ending makes up for it.So let me talk more about the voice actors. Jim Carrey in general suits the Dr Seuss universe, I'd go as far to say that he is almost like a Seuss character brought to life. However its nice to see him toned down a fair bit for Horton. He adds a certain amount of warmth to the character that always makes him likable, he also delivers the traditional funny voices and manic sections that he relishes in. Steve Carrell almost runs off with the movie as the Mayor, however a lot of this works because he is given such a great script. Give Carrell a bad script and he is annoying (see Evan Almighty) give him a good, funny script and he is one of the funniest actors around. His character is constantly being insane and Carrell tones suit the character plentiful. Will Arnett makes a very welcome appearance as one of the funniest characters in the movie, Vlad (the bad Vlad, not the one with the cookies). Vlad is a brilliant character, although given way too few screen time. Carol Burnett makes a menacing villain and her scenes are very well written. Seth Rogen unfortunately has way too little to do and not enough humour for my liking. Dan Fogler thankfully shows up barely at all, thank god as the man is possibly the most wretched actor around at the moment. Jesse McCartney also makes an appearance, but thankfully once again he has barely anything to do.Horton Hears A Who succeeds where the other Seuss adaptations fail mainly because this film has genuine heart. The Grinch, while amusing lacked heart and when it tried to deliver some sentimentality near the end it was way too forced. The Cat in the Hat had no heart at all, in fact I'd go as far to say that that movie was simply a way of scaring kids. Horton is a touching family film, I urge parents to take their kids to see this as it really is something the family should see together. The final quarter of Horton, especially the ""we are here"" scenes are pure brilliance, in fact those scenes really had me on the edge of my seat, a rare thing for an animated movie. The movie is also genuinely funny, Katie is an ingenious idea, I have no idea what she is but she is brilliant. An animé section had me in hysterics and the Who world is so ridiculously happy it made me smile as well. The faults do kick in towards the middle section, after a good beginning the film just starts to slow down. Once Vlad appears the movie picks its pace up again. Also there are too many characters wasted to make this the perfect animated movie. But Horton is still a lot better than the majority of animated rubbish we have to endure year in year out.Horton Hears A Who is possibly Bluesky's best foray into the animated world, I'm still debating whether the brilliant Ice Age just tops it though. The film is touching, funny and a joy to watch. If you want a faithful Seuss adaptation then watch this, and if you're still traumatised by The Cat in the Hat, do not fear this one won't give you nightmares."
31,Horton Hears a Who!,10,30 December 2008,An excellent movie that I could watch over and over again and be delighted every time,"As many might think when they first hear of this movie, it is not as horrible as it may seem. In fact, when I first viewed this movie, I was truly astonished by how wonderful of a time I had with it. There were tons of humorous lines and scenes throughout that I just could not help myself to chuckle and smile at. The story is just as lovable as it was with the book and 1970 short, but better because of the replay value and fun atmosphere the actors and actresses bring to the characters, and the originality the writers use.When it starts out, I am immediately interested. Though Jim Carrey is annoying, to a certain extent, to some people with some of his roles, he plays a perfect voice-over for Horton the Elephant. I love his deliverance of the lines, as well as everybody else's including Steve Carell and Carol Burnett, who all brought amazing spunk and character to the movie. The characters themselves are energetic and fun, and even though there are some who push lovableness a bit, at the end I am left praising all of them for their redeeming aspects, and the amazingly fun qualities each one brings to the storyline.After plenty of rewatches, I am still left adoring this movie. It is because of how fun and lively the movie makes me feel inside. Children are bound to love it, but I can't believe that I was as pleased with it as my two nephews who have viewed it with me. The vivacity this movie is bound to make the audience feel is brought upon by the awesome attributes it contributes to the exact purpose of what it is trying to do, and that is to give an entertaining, fun filled adventure that the whole family is bound to enjoy.From the tongue-in-cheek jokes, to the incredibly defining character personalities, this movie is almost near perfect in everything it does, and though most might think I am exaggerating a bit, I love animation, and this is probably my favorite animation that I have seen that has came out in recent years, even counting Disney Pixar. It is remarkable, and I am able to enjoy something from it every time. The ending song rendition always gives me chills, just because of how amazing the whole entire movie is leading up to it."
32,Horton Hears a Who!,10,15 April 2008,Acid + LSD + Dr. Seuss = Best Movie Of All Time,"There is nothing about this movie that I disliked. At all. I just wanted to get that out of the way before I got into the meat and potatos of the review.First, the animation was absolutely spectacular. Blue Sky Studios did a fantastic job on that end of the deal. The voice talent was excellent, Jim Carrey as Horton and Steve Carell as the Mayor of Whoville were both fantastic, and their supporting cast was absolutely phenomenal as well (I was particularly taken with Will Arnett as Vlad the Vulture).The story was not 100% Dr. Seuss canon, but it the artistic license taken was not even close to insulting to Seuss' memory, and most of the differences from the poem/story and the screenplay are barely noticeable.I refuse to give away spoilers, though I will say one thing: Give this movie a chance. If you walk in without expectations as I did, you will be absolutely blown away.Horton Hears a Who! - 10/10"
33,Horton Hears a Who!,10,13 April 2008,A Very fun Family movie that actually makes you laugh!,"Me and my friend had just got done seeing The Ruins and wanted to see Prom Night, but we ended up seeing Horton Hears A Who instead. We Both thought that it would be OK at best and the laughs would be just for kids, but in our showing at least the teens and adults wee doing most of the laughing.i'm sure i heard the story sometime, but i cant remember it. SO i heard that they were making a movie about it i wanted to see it and i ended up Loving it! The animation is perfect, the voices behind these character's were spot on, the laughs were very funny and thought out. i'm only 17 but i thought this was a very funny movie that anyone can enjoys, and my friend did too!So in the end if you have a family, or if you just want to see a movie that will make you feel good and laugh Horton Hears a Who! is the movie for you!"
34,Horton Hears a Who!,10,27 March 2008,"A masterpiece-- and funny, too!","I remember hearing about this film when it came out. And, you know what I thought? 'Oh, this will be an ordinary children's film that won't have a good rating on IMDb.' Then my mother and I came to see it, not fully knowing what to expect... And when I came out of the cinema, I was in absolute awe of 'Horton Hears a Who!' Let me tell you why. First of all, the film had excellent humour (including a genius anime parody sequence), yet it also possessed gripping suspense and heartrending drama. It's likely that you'll laugh AND cry-- the climax made me excited-- and probably do either or both loudly. What would happen to the Whos? Secondly, the animation is beautiful-- stunningly detailed, yet not too realistic. And, finally-- did I mention the intense emotions that this film made me feel? Overall, this film is a masterpiece with the perfect balance of drama and humour. Adults will love the delicious drama, while the younger people will get a good laugh. Bring the whole family -- you may not regret it!"
35,Horton Hears a Who!,4,19 March 2008,Not for those over the age of 12,"Four times in as many movies, Blue Sky Studios has proved itself a distant third when it comes to CGI film-making. Like the Ice Age movies before it, Horton Hears a Who coasted on the big-name talent behind the mic, ignoring the clever styling and over-their-heads adult humor that have made Pixar -- and, to a lesser extent, Dreamworks -- so successful. All in all, your kids will probably be entertained for 90 minutes, but Horton really is nothing more than cinematic cotton candy: empty calories and completely forgettable.As for the cast, Carell shows a real flair for voice-over work, while Carrey's performance left something to be desired. One doesn't realize how much of his shtick involves facial expressions, which don't come through very well on an elephant's computerized visage. The lesser players -- notably Isla Fisher -- turn in some very good work.The animation was fair, but nowhere near the quality or detail of a Pixar pic. But the real problem with Horton was the dialog. It just wasn't funny. Even the small children in the audience laughed only occasionally, and I chuckled only once during the movie's thankfully short run-time. Perhaps the writers felt compelled to remain true to Seuss's original work, as they seemed to add very little originality and a whole lot of benign filler.So unless you're dying to get the kids out of the house and don't mind dropping $10 a head at your local AMC, wait for Horton to hit the bargain bin and save for you money for WALL-E this summer."
36,Horton Hears a Who!,10,14 March 2008,They said you couldn't do it!,"OMG!OMG! OHHH Myyyyy God! You did it!you did it!You did it,They said you could not do it, But indeed you did! I can't believe it If anything they improved on the story. animation A+, story A,comedy A, they had everything and more. Even the Poppy field! OOps voices A also. Carol Burnette,Jim carrey were wonderful. there is nothing wrong with the film,period. Wall-e is going to have to be perfect to top this one. go see it at once! even twice!Blue sky has hit gold with this one. I hope they get the rights to do Horton Hatches the Egg. this will be a solid buy when it comes out in DVD. I know I will buy it. opps the mayor as voiced by Steve Carell is great too signedDavid Guillot"
37,Horton Hears a Who!,1,23 March 2008,Don't waste your money!,"""Horton"" might be suitable for children under 7, who could be noncritical and accepting, but anyone over 12 will squirm with embarrassment at how dumb this gets. We nearly walked out several times, and stayed only so I could add it to my movie ""life list."" The film jumps the tracks early on, when, as Horton is setting out to find a safe place for the speck, it breaks into several minutes of a totally different and markedly inferior Japanese animation style, including voices in Japanese with subtitles. Already you are saying ""What the?"" The picture might have been saved by better writing and directing, such as of the kangaroo (Carol Burnette), but things get dumber as she rallies the jungle against Horton on a highly trivial pretext.If you were holding back on your desire to get up and leave, hoping things would get better, you'll be floored by the eye-rolling final scene where the former adversaries burst into song. What a mess!Savoring this bad memory I lowered my rating above from 2 to 1. This film makes ""Night at the Museum"" look like Shakespeare."
38,Horton Hears a Who!,10,23 March 2008,The Best,"I don't think words alone could express my love for this movie!!! Its right on par with the book! The film makers did it outstanding job! It feels so great to finally see quality movies coming back into theaters.The cast was perfect, Jim Carey was the bomb as Horton, Steve Carell really adds a good feeling to the movie! And Carol Burnett, I mean come on, how can you not love her. This movie is a classic and it deserves its place in Hollywood Hall of Fame. It should be placed on the IMDb top movies of all time, or must see lists!!! The movie is going to rock on Blu-Ray in High Definition, I will buy it the first day it comes out!!!"
39,Horton Hears a Who!,10,22 March 2008,Horton is a hoot....,"Yes, there was a very brief shot of the Grinch during the celebration in Whoville at the end. Very clever in-jokes throughout....would need to see the film more than once to catch them all. Took children to this movie, not expecting too much, and enjoyed every moment. will be a classic. charming and kids got the message. hope adults do, too. My only disappointment was Carol Burnett's voice. I was so conscious of its being Carol Burnett, I didn't get quite as much out of the story. Jim Carrey, however, not ordinarily a favorite, was excellent as Horton. Really really good. The children I took all loved Jo-Jo's saving the day. I think they really identified with having a child be such a big help and making such a marvelous big noise."
40,Horton Hears a Who!,9,16 March 2008,"Hilarious, enjoyable and entertaining","I like it very much. Its a very funny movie and at the same time very very profound and with a very good message. A really good story about an elephant name Horton that struggles to protect a microscopic community from his neighbors who refuse to believe it exists. I like very much the thing that they combined CGI animation with traditional anime like animation. The humor is for all the family, it has some fine comedy for adults and the kids will also enjoy it as well. Very nice cast of voices each one fits very well with the characters. In conclusion, this is a good animation movie , so enjoyable and entertaining for everyone no matter age size or gender."
41,Horton Hears a Who!,9,15 March 2008,It is faithful one hundred percent!,"Dr. Seuss would be so proud! Hollywood finally got it right! Horton the kind elephant who is voiced by Jim Carrey is a wonderful adaptation of Dr Seuss' character about the lovable elephant.I was getting worried that Hollywood would never be able to get the children's books by Dr. Seuss right... they almost got it with ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", but failed miserably with ""The Cat in the Hat"". They went back to what works... animation! Every voice that was cast was perfect... no misses here! Perfect family film! No innuendo about bathroom jokes, or wink and a nod sexual references... just plain fun and cute! Go and enjoy!"
42,Horton Hears a Who!,1,22 June 2008,A slap in Dr. Suess' face.,"Dr. Seuss original message gave his young readers an important lesson about how any voice, no matter how small it may appear to be, can change the world.This movie slammed that positive message in the trash and replaced it with religious propaganda. The Kangaroo represented evil reason and science, and Horton represented wonderful belief and religion.Dr. Suess books had positive messages that brought people together with common ideals. This movie draws battle field lines and waves the Cristian banner high. Did anyone else notice the evil vulture sounded Jewish? Wow! A kids movie with an evil sneaky jew. Nice stereo types.What trash!"
43,Horton Hears a Who!,5,15 March 2008,"I Love You Jim Carrey, But...","***SPOILER WARNING***The animation in this film is flawless. Characters move like humans without looking too much like humans. The environments are beautiful and stay true to Seuss' palette of pastel colors. There are several references to other books of his throughout the movie that I had fun finding - ""Green Eggs and Ham"", ""Cat in the Hat"", ""The Lorax"", etc. but other than that, this movie disappointed me.There are three main characters in Horton Hears a Who!: Horton, The Mayor, and Kangaroo. The first two might as well be clones of one another as they both trample around hurting themselves. The Kangaroo is a generic - for lack of a word - Oppressive-Authority-Figure who, in the end, becomes good character oh-so quickly after ages of fussing.Other characters pop in and out so swiftly that their personalities are developed through entrances and exits (e.g. face-plants, racing behind bushes, floating away). Vlad - the vulture - I thought was amazing... Until he hid behind his wings like a melodramatic villain. Everyone moves as if caffeine is constantly flowing into their veins as they flail their arms about and scream. Slapstick humor isn't Seuss at all. His humor was put into his ability to rhyme and create silly words with silly worlds and creatures thrown in - which is probably why I'm disappointed every time one of his books is turned into a movie. In comparison to modern Sitcoms, slapstick comedy is the laugh-track of this movie.The peak was at the very end, as Kangaroo was threatening to plop Whoville into a boiling pot of muck. I was about to say ""Okay, this is a good movie"" as I was drawn even more and more into the tense situation of an entire world being destroyed... Until the entire cast broke out into song and threw off the whole emotion of the previous scene.It was also awkward to have two clips of 2d animations in two different styles of the movie without warning... and only in the first half of the movie.Heck, you know it's a bad kid's movie when even the kids are the ones not paying attention. Everyone in my audience under the age of thirteen was talking to mommy and daddy screaming for popcorn or why a character said this or that. The children are not at all absorbed into Dr. Seuss' fantastical world nor do they feel a connection with any characters.5/10"
44,Horton Hears a Who!,5,27 January 2014,Not that funny,"This is probably a good movie for kids. It's very well animated and pretty frenetic. It also does a decent job of adapting the story. It expands Horton's story a bit, and it expands the Whoville story a lot, but it feels like it wants to stay close to the source material, unlike The Lorax.But there are a couple of things that kept me from enjoying this.First off, writers should never try and add their own rhymes to a Dr. Suess story. Pseudo-Suess feels so pedestrian and uninspired compared to the real thing, so if you can't find the story connector's you want in his work, just don't rhyme.A bigger problem is that I didn't find it very funny. A kid might, but it's silly, generic humor. I don't consider this a movie like Toy Story that is as much fun for adults as for kids."
45,Horton Hears a Who!,1,7 July 2013,WHY JIM CARREY WHY did you star in this piece of garbage.,"Yes as a lover for animated movies at the age of(well I'm in my early 20's)I seen this little gem on TV a while back and I thought that it was going to be a really good movie because it features my favourite actor of ALL time Jim Carrey. Yes his wacky,yes he makes weird shapes with his face,but this guy always makes me laugh from Ace Ventura to Dumb & Dumber,so why did he star in this movie is beyond me.The animation was nice but god the story and everything else was stupid and GOD AWFUL. If you want my advice avoid this movie at ALL costs. Steve Carell plays a Who (his also Gru in Despicable Me 1 and 2 which were very good),while Carrey plays the elephant Horton OH YEAH and Carell's charcther lives in a god- forsaking FLOWER.Yeah it was THAT BAD."
46,Horton Hears a Who!,9,2 April 2008,Not exactly what you may expect.,"Just came back from the theaters and lemme tell you- WOW. I loved it. There has been a lot of negativity towards this film and because I hadn't seen a GOOD cartoon movie in such a long time I didn't set the standard too high when I went to see this with my little sister. When it first started I was like, ""This is stupid."" But as the movie went on i fell in love with it, slowly. It was delightful. I particularly loved the bridge scene I swear I laughed so hard. I'm a pretty tough judge and I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, one of the best animated movies I've seen since the golden era of Disney. It was just wonderful. Some people won't like it, other's will. It depends on who you are. If you're looking for a story about loyalty, friendship, with a good strong moral message, that's cute and funny then this movies for you, if not steer right away. I haven't been a fan of Jim Carrey's recent work so I wasn't expecting anything 'good' to come out of this movie, I was wrong. Jim was PERFECT in this role, or so I think. You don't have to read the book I didn't,the plot is pretty clear. An awesome movie, with an awesome cast. I can't wait to buy it on DVD."
47,Horton Hears a Who!,4,10 July 2017,(Rewrite) Horton Hears a Who: Meh!,"Meh. It's not bad, but I think Blue Sky's can do better. I mean, for god sake's the whole movie is CGI! The movie is actually a reboot from the 1970 TV movie: Horton Hears a Who! The original book was made by Dr. Suess (idk how to spell his name.) But the 2008 reboot. Huh? The movie is about Horton, an elephant who finds a speck and believes that there is a small world is in the speck. But there is a kangaroo that implies otherwise. Despite her saying there is nothing in the speck, Horton ignores her and tries to find a safe place for the speck so it can be undisturbed. In the speck, there is a world called, WhoVille. To be honest, the movie is not bad! There is some adult jokes in it. 1: ""Boob"" is said multiple times. 2: Pee jokes. 3: Poop Jokes. But the most inappropriate joke in the movie was that when Horton Crosses a deadly bridge that he almost died in, he has a smile in his face as if its like nothing ever happened, saying: ""Woo! that could've been a disaster!"" Then while he's walking, his legs start to move up and down. Then suddenly, he starts to shake his butt in front of the screen, with a smirk on his face. WHY!!!??? THEY EVEN ADDED A SOUND EFFECT IN IT. WHILE HE SHAKES HIS BUTT, A SOUND WOBBLY COMES WHILE HIS BUTT IS SHAKING! (which sounds wrong) Then he says: ""Wow! This feels very good! It's gonna be my new since of purpose."" WHAT THE HECK!? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!? Then suddenly he jumps closer to the screen TWERKING! FOLLOWED BY THE INSTRUMENTAL VERSION OF THE SONG: BABY GOT BACK!! 2 SECONDS LATER, HE JUMPS MORE CLOSER TO THE SCREEN STILL TWERKING WITH A HAPPY EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE! (its almost as of Horton was proud of his fat butt shake) 3 SECONDS LATER, HE JUMPS EVEN CLOSER TO THE SCREEN, STILL TWERKING, AND STILL SMILING!!! WHO MADE THAT SCENE? WHO DID IT AND WHY!!!??? To be honest, I love his butt shake. (IM NOT GAY) But other then those jokes, its a great animated movie for kids of all ages! I recommend it! 4 out of 10!"
48,Horton Hears a Who!,7,1 April 2017,Pretty good.,"This film is pretty good. It has a great voice cast, great CGI, great story adaptation, and a good premise. There are a few problems though. One of the problems that I have with this film is that it's mainly for kids. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, it can make adults like myself feel a bit off putting. And another issue is that this film can have a few goofy scenes that don't really have anything to do with the plot and could make one think ""Okay, get on with it!"". Other than all of that, this film is actually pretty good. As it's not only a good family film, but it also has its funny moments that make it all the more enjoyable. I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the book by Dr. Suess, as this film will not disappoint in the slightest."
49,Horton Hears a Who!,9,15 December 2016,A Dr. Seuss Film Adaptation Done Right!!,"Okay, admittedly, I thought that this movie was going like all of the other big budget Dr. Seuss movie adaptations (The Grinch, The Cat in the Hat [2003] and The Lorax [2012]) because of how those movies completely missed the point of why people kept coming back to their original source materials, respectively. But, I've started to watch this one and.....I was shocked to find out that this movie is absolute 100% faithful to its' original source material!!!! Yeah, a big-budget Dr. Seuss movie that actually understood, appreciated and respected its' original source material?! Could this really be heaven?! But, like most movie adaptations, it's not always perfect. But, I will say that this without a doubt the best Dr. Seuss movie adaptation that we've gotten so far and I actually am glad that the production crew, the studios, and the cast put in a lot of effort into making this movie. So yeah, this movie is definitely worth a watch, if you're a huge fan or an average fan of Dr. Seuss."
50,Horton Hears a Who!,6,20 May 2015,Horton Hears Little People.,"Horton Hears a Who (2008): Dir: Jimmy Hayward, Steve Martino / Voices: Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, Caroll Burnett, Will Arnett, Amy Poehler: Amusing family film regarding those least likely. Horton is a lovable elephant who hears a yelp within a speck on a clover. He discovers the community of Who-ville inhabiting the speck and befriends the Mayor. Formula storyline regards Horton trying to get the speck to safety. Directed by Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino whose animation reflects the famous book for children. Jim Carrey voices Horton who faces all odds for the sake of safety of this little society. Steve Carell voices the Mayor who fathers 96 children. How someone can schedule that family is a mystery but the sex must have been extreme and exhausting. Without giving way to spoilers the plot solution rests on the Mayor when Horton has done all he could. Caroll Burnett voices the strict kangaroo. Why a kangaroo is in the same reserve as an elephant is beyond me, but she is predictable and boring. Will Arnett is the voice of Vlad the vulture whose job is to prevent Horton from completing his quest. Vlad isn't particularly interesting and serves one purpose only. Amy Poehler voices the mother of 96 children, which means her sex life must be through the roof. Themes regard friendship, family and the belief in those things we may not see but know are there. Score: 6 / 10"
51,Horton Hears a Who!,8,14 March 2008,Sweet and delightful animation,"(Synopsis) In the movie ""Horton Hears a Who,"" Jim Carey is the voice of Horton, the inventive and imaginative elephant who teaches his young friends about the amazing world around them. One day Horton, with his big ears, hears a voice on a speck of dust floating in the jungle air. Horton catches the speck on a dandelion, and begins to talk to the speck. The Mayor of Whoville (voice Steve Carell) talks to Horton, and the Mayor can not believe that there is something bigger than his world. After there are several climate changes (darkness in the middle of the day and snow in summer) that occur in Whoville, the Mayor believes that his world is in great danger. The Mayor tries to warn his people of the impending doom, but everybody ridicules him and thinks he is crazy. Horton is getting the same reaction from everyone who thinks he is also crazy; especially the kangaroo (voice Carol Burnett) who wants to get rid of the speck, and Horton's wild ideas. Horton defends the speck by saying that ""a person's a person, no matter how small."" Horton talks to the Mayor and tells him that he is going to put the speck in a safe place and out of danger.(My Comment) The animated movie ""Horton Hears a Who"" is an adaptation of the Dr. Suess children's book. Parents finally have another G rated movie to take their children. The film is excellent for young children in that it gives them a moral to the story to live by, that you must protect those who are smaller than us. Jim Carey does a great voice that brings the character of Horton alive, and Carol Burnett is superb as the bossy kangaroo. The film shows the fine qualities that elephants are portrayed to have such as excellent memories and trustworthiness. Horton is determined to help the people of Whoville no matter the consequences. There are some funny scenes with the gorillas and some eventful use of bananas that involved Horton. Young children in the audience loved Horton, and I thought it was a sweet and delightful animation movie. (20th Century Fox, Run Time 1:28, Rated G)(8/10)"
52,Horton Hears a Who!,5,30 April 2008,"Mildly entertaining animated film, but suffers from a degree of preachiness.","As in so many recent animated films, Horton Hears A Who boasts excellent graphics and lively voice-overs, but the story lacks a true sense of purpose and direction. This is a little surprising as the film is based on a book by the usually reliable Dr Seuss. From such a source one would be right to expect something with a bit more depth, but what emerges is a fairly routine and uninspiring time-filler  very easy to watch, enjoyable in an undemanding way, and completely forgotten within the week.Pleasant, unassuming elephant Horton (voice of Jim Carrey) thinks he hears the sound of voices on a small speck of clover as it drifts by him one day. His thoughts prove correct when he learns that a society of Whos, living in the tiny town of Whoville, actually exists on the speck of clover dust. What the Whos don't realise is that their world is drifting around precariously, in danger of destruction in the blink of an eye if the speck lands in a river or is trodden on by a large animal. Horton establishes a communication with the Mayor Of Whoville (voice of Steve Carrell), and agrees to help look after the clover speck until a safe place can be found for it. However, some of the other animals living in Horton's jungle think that he's going crazy and refuse to buy into his story of a minuscule world existing on the clover. Kangaroo (voice of Carol Burnett) is especially angered  she thinks Horton is twisting the minds of the young and impressionable with his crazy stories  and she takes it upon herself to get hold of the dust and destroy it. This prompts a long and dangerous quest for Horton, who must avoid the doubters and get the clover speck to a safe place where it will never be found.There's not really enough in the film that one would class as genuinely funny. The bridge scene contains chuckles, and Vlad the psychopathic vulture has his moments, but for the rest of the time the film is quietly amusing rather than uproariously hilarious. Carrey and Carrell provide enjoyable voice work  they're enthusiastic real-life personalities (as we all know from their previous film work) and their natural flair enables them to make likable characters. Burnett is similarly effective as the mean and horrid Kangaroo, although the character is virtually Facsist in attitude and very hard to like, even as a hissable villain. As noted already, the animation is polished and always pleasing to the eye. But while the film appeals to the eye, it has a far lesser impact on the brain. The moral messages  tolerance for all, the power of imagination, standing up for your beliefs  are all very worthy, but delivered here in an excessively heavy-handed and preachy manner. There's something oddly unappealing about being preached at in any movie, but it feels doubly uncalled-for in a kids' film. There's enough here to keep you mildly entertained, but little that will enable the film to stand the true test of time."
53,Horton Hears a Who!,9,23 March 2008,Horton Smells A Hit,"I'm glad but disappointed that there wasn't many people in the cinema when i went to see this.1. because i got to laugh as loud as i wanted and i laughed. 2. because no one bothered me when i aplauded some of the scenes. I don't usually applaud something unless it's borderline genius.i've found this bothersome about CGI's for ages, in the olden days you got animations from Disney that told kids ""lying is wrong"" and ""dont eat too much"" but although we've only gone 20-30 years into the future since the last great moral cartoon most CGI's and other animations now tend to substitute moral messages for toilet humor.and then comes Horton Hears A Who, and it doesn't hit you with morals in one of those childish fashions but really speaks them with a lot of heart.i've been wrong about movies in the past, i said that both Pirates of the Caribbean and Superman Returns didn't look any good but was wowed by them, I judged pirates because it was made by Disney and wanted someone to give Superman a bad review because i felt it couldn't be as good as it sounds but wow, wow and again wow. I judged Horton immediately for lack of storyline but it's the most creative, imaginative and funny animations i've ever seen.and please do not blink during the Anime cross-over, that's one of the scenes i clapped for.This last part is aimed at the user djekell for his ""Logic Problems"" thread.to answer no 5 - the place where Horton tries to go is like 2 miles away when you see him looking, maybe less, plus he was led astray by the vulture, anyone who ran could catch up to him within minutes."
54,Horton Hears a Who!,8,12 June 2010,Surprisingly well made and entertaining.,"I wasn't expecting anything good from this film, considering that the other two live-action movies inspired in the books of the Doctor Seuss (The Grinch and The Cat in the Hat) were absolutely horrible, painful to watch.Fortunately, ""Horton"" was a much better film, with a nice animation, funny voice performances and very likable characters. Even when some parts of the story were somewhat predictable and clichéd, it still was pretty enjoyable form beginning to end. It catches very well the essence of the original book, and unlike ""The Grinch"" and ""The Cat in the Hat"" it never turns annoying or corny. JIm Carrey and Steve Carrel made a great job in this movie.This is a very good for children that adults can enjoy as well. I highly recommend it."
55,Horton Hears a Who!,,15 March 2009,A colourful and fun family film  the clunky pro-faith message doesn't get in the way too much,"Horton the elephant believes he has heard a scream from a small speck of dust on a flower. His friends think he is nuts but Horton maintains his story and is vindicated when he actually makes contact with the major of the tiny world on his speck. While he is being mocked by his neighbours, Horton tries to ensure that the speck stays safe while the Mayor of Who-ville wonders how he can let people know the truth without getting sectioned.In a discussion on the merits of Wall-E, someone said to me that they much preferred Horton Hears a Who. Rather than immediately scoff at such an idea, I decided that I should at least watch this other ""great"" film so that I could make my mind up for myself. Despite my doubt over this claim, I did try and approach the film with an open mind to see what it was like. To get the comparison issue out of the way I will say that this film is far from even being the equal of the much, much better Wall-E. However, this is not the same as the film being bad, because it is certainly not, just that it is much more of a simple affair that is best for children. I'm not sure about the original material but other than the look of the film, there is not a great deal of Seuss' rhyming imagination left in this version. Instead we get a bit of a ""pro-faith"" message in the middle of a big colourful adventure on two worlds.This aspect of it is all very colourful and fun as it produces a fun family film that has little of offense and much that is amusing or funny. The focus is of course children because there is a lot of physical humour but as an adult I still liked it and had quite a few laughs along the way. The voice work is mostly good and matches the broad family comedy of the piece. Carrey and Carell do the best work and do well together and individually. Arnett, Burnett, Pressly, Poehler and a few others all add good support, although I didn't think much of Fisher or Rogen, who both felt like their names were more important than their bits.Overall Horton is a colourful and quite fun family film that is easy to enjoy and the ""pro-faith"" message, although obvious, isn't too obtrusive. The animation is good and has some imaginative touches, while the laughs are pretty regular, even if most of them are best for children rather than adults. Just for the record though, Wall-E is a better all-round film!"
56,Horton Hears a Who!,9,9 April 2008,gorgeous,"i'll leave the long analyses to the other commenters, and just say that whoever does the deliciously-radiant lighting for Blue Sky should be given a major share in the company. SO beautiful. and the subtle colors, such a nice change from the make-everything-as-bright-as- possible school that seems to be the only option most of the time. the animation/modelling was also wonderful, total slapstick.plus, Jerry Seinfeld and Amanda Bynes were NOT in it, which is a major plus.but man it's hard as a professional CG artist to get lost in these things, even if they do a great job, always scrutinizing wrinkles, noting how ""they"" moved that mouth just then, etc. I really wish i hadn't known it was Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell doing the voices, kept visualizing them offscreen. it's not fair, i want to get sucked in!"
57,Horton Hears a Who!,10,30 March 2008,Who-Rific!,"This movie was great! good for family .CHILDREN,ADULTS,even TEENS will love this movie!!!!it was funny,and cool,very hip and cool.i would recommend this movie to anyone!My favorite part was when the mayer gets a stapler stuck to his head!it's very funny,also when he tries to give enough time to spend with his children but it only lasts 12 seconds because he has 96 children one of them being a boy named JoJo. I for one think this is the second coolest Dr Suess movie. You'll laugh,cry,and jump for joy.No matter what age or gender! Carey and Carell did a great job they add more feeling and really get into the mode and really get into their characters."
58,Horton Hears a Who!,10,26 March 2008,Horton hears a Who is the Best Animated Film of 2008,"My little girl was so anxious to see Horton hears a Who and so yesterday we went and saw this fabulous movie. It is a true adaptation of Dr. Seuss's book and the voices of Jim Carrey, Steve Carrell and Carol Burnett were each performed par excellence! The animation was as well done as any Disney film and never except for the Grinch who stole Christmas was there a better Dr. Seuss book brought to film. At first, I thought Jim Carrey would get a little over the top like Cat in the Hat but he nailed this part and Horton could not have been performed any better by any other actor in Hollywood. I particularly loved Steve Carrell as the Mayor of Who Ville where he gave a beautifully poignant and heartfelt performance. Carol Burnett who is quite a spoiler in the story was wonderful as a villain. I kept marveling at the extraordinary work of the animators and the beautiful scenery created, I kept thinking Disney is always so excellent and always does the best animation but this company deserves full credit for beautiful artwork with such vivid colors it was a joy to watch. The story moral that life can exist no matter how small and even the smallest of small have a life. This was exceptionally approptiate when the earth is dealing with global warming and who's to say what tiny species could become extinct unless we all do our part and help those little species like Horton have a safe place to exist."
59,Horton Hears a Who!,10,23 March 2008,LOVED it! Fun for the whole family,"Let me just say that I wasn't' expecting much but this movie turned out to be my favourite animated movie of all times. And with a great message... Well, if you don't believe me, go check it for yourself. Maybe all other Dr.Seuss-turned movies seem senseless... including how the Grinch stole Xmas. Best interpretation of a Dr. Seuss universe for the big screen too. Loved it!!!!! Carey, very funny, carrell, super funny, carol.WOW what a performance... My 2 year old had a blast, and I could see it again and again... Have already scheduled the next viewing with the niece this time. Ha! Hope this movie gets the attention it deserves, one of the reasons I decided to write this review. First time reviewing by the way. I would always write if all movies were this good. Animated or not this movie rocks and people of all ages will have a fun afternoon."
60,Horton Hears a Who!,10,22 March 2008,Bow Chicka Wow Wow,"In all honesty, I saw this movie completely by default. I was on a date (Keep in mind that I am 16 and my boyfriend is 21) and we wanted to go to the movies. I was bent on seeing Doomsday but the theater we went to was not showing it. In fact, every movie that WAS playing there was already in progress. Except for Horton Hears a Who. Here I was thinking, ""Awesome. This is great. I get to go see Dr. Seuss with the guy who I worship who probably constantly is thinking 'I need to get an older gal' and HERE is Horton Hears a Who to save my gosh damn life."" I wanted to just leave and go do something else, but he was sick that night and just wanted to chill so we went and paid for our tickets. Throughout the entire movie we both laughed at least every other 5 minutes. It was a decent movie. In fact, I'll buy it when it comes out on DVD! I was a little disappointed when I couldn't be ""scared"" and squish up against him, but the laughing certainly made both of our nights a lot better! I recommend this movie to any/every one."
61,Horton Hears a Who!,10,19 March 2008,Let's all hear an enjoyable WHO,"A charming retelling of a Dr. Seuss classic tale, mixed in with Jim Carrey and Steve Carell humor. The Story begins with a lovable friendly elephant named Horton(Jim Carrey), one day finds a speck on a clover , he begins to think that there is something living in it, but the other animals thinks he is crazy, turns out he's right. There is a town in it called Who-ville, and the only one that hears him is The Mayor(Steve Carell), who is shock to find out he is smaller then a tick. Horton is determined to get the speck safety, but will he make before it is too late? An enjoyable film for kids and adults, It fairs better then The Grinch(2000) and The Cat In The Hat(2003). The Animation was awesome too. For parents and kids, please don't miss this one."
62,Horton Hears a Who!,10,20 March 2008,"A surprisingly entertaining film, Dr Seuss would be proud.","When i first saw the teaser trailer for Horton Hears a Who, I had very low expectations. I figured it would be a complete dud. However after seeing the second trailer and a sneak peek of this movie, I decided to give it a chance. First off, the animation was stunning, and even looked amazingly realistic in some scenes of the film. Second, The movie was hilarious and FOR ONCE it didn't have any unnecessary adult humor like the previous Dr. Seuss films(AKA the huge disappointment, 2003's Cat in the Hat). Its pleasing and entertaining for children and adults(my whole family absolutely adored it). Third, The cast was great. Jim Carrey was an excellent voice choice for Horton. So was Steve Carrell. And Finally, it wasn't too long or too short and it stayed to Dr. Seuss's style and the original though the whole movie out! Although the song at the end didn't really fit with the plot of the movie, it was entertaining and I enjoyed every minute of it. Heck, I enjoyed every minute of the movie period. (especially the unexpected anime scene) Highly recommended 10/10"
63,Horton Hears a Who!,8,23 August 2014,"Beautiful Animation that Stays True to Dr. Seuss's Work,","Horton Hears a Who! is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific voice cast.The animation in this movie is absolutely beautiful,unique and it really brings Dr. Seuss's art style to life the way I think he would have wanted it to had he been around to see it,it's colourful and wacky,the way you would want an animated movie based on a Dr. Seuss book to look.I loved Jim Carrey's voice work as Horton the elephant,he clearly got to improvise some of his lines as well which I really liked and his voice definitely suited the character,I also liked Steve Carell and Seth Rogen,I am a huge fan of all three of these comedy actors.A quick and very fun movie,Horton Hears a Who is very enjoyable and imaginative and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good animation or family movie. After an elephant discovers an entire town is living on a flower,he tries to bring it to a safe place,however his jungle neighbours go against him."
64,Horton Hears a Who!,7,24 January 2014,Sweet kids movie with a good message,"Horton the elephant (Jim Carrey) from the jungle of Nool hears a voice coming from a speck of dust. It turns out to be the voice of the Mayor (Steve Carell) of the microscopic town of Whoville where the Whos live. He tries to save the speck by placing it on top of Mount Nool. But nobody believes him, and the strict Kangaroo endeavors to stop him. No matter what the obstacle, Horton must save the Whos. After all, a person is a person, no matter how small.I find both sides of the story very touching. Neither character is believed by anybody. Yet they both risk it all for what they believe. The ending is especially touching. It doesn't get better than the idealism of Horton. I love Horton crossing the bridge, but Vlad may be too much. It puts a little too much ugly danger in an otherwise beautiful kids cartoon. It's a short movie, and they probably needed to pad it to fill out a full movie. It's a sweet kids movie with a good message."
65,Horton Hears a Who!,8,25 October 2013,Carrey and Carell's second pairing is the best animated adaptation of a Dr Seuss book by far,"I have never read the book this film is based on but when it was released at the cinema I fancied seeing it because I'm an animation nut so I saw it with a member of support staff from my previous care home and we both enjoyed it. Upon renting this film twice on separate occasions, I got more out of it on these occasions in comparison to my first viewing.The 3D animation is consistent for the most part, but I found it rather jarring and jerky towards the end and I liked the 2D segments, the first of which was true to the style of Dr Seuss's book illustrations as were the 3D character designs of Horton and the Whos but the second had a bizarre anime look to it. Horton is the funniest character here and I like what he does to certain parts of his body such as forming his ears as a swimming cap, using his trunk as a shower and later blowing his trunk up like a balloon to enable him to cross the rope bridge more easily. I liked the action at the dentist that took place at the same time as Horton's struggle to cross the bridge while 'The Blue Danube' played - this made me think of the episode of 'Mr Bean' where the eponymous character visits the dentist. The other scenes where Horton's actions had a huge impact on Whoville (the second Seuss film adaptation to have a town with this name, the first one being 'The Grinch') were fun to watch as well. Not only did I like the use of 'The Blue Danube (one of my favourite and the most popular pieces of classical music despite not being a big fan of the genre) ' but also how the opening music started off sounding soothing then progressing to being more powerful and upbeat when Horton is introduced and I liked the music the Whos played whilst repeatedly chanting, ""we are here"" during the climax. Although there is only one 'true' song sung by the characters at the end, it is quite catchy nonetheless. The writing is clever and witty while the satires of the iPhone and MySpace keep the story up to date. I do agree with another reviewer that certain parts are clichéd such as the slow-motion moments, the false alarm of Morton scurrying through the grass and Horton shouting, ""No!"" during the climax. Besides Horton, the other characters I liked were the Mayor of Whoville and his family, the strict and overprotective Kangaroo who insists on keeping Rudy inside her pouch at all times, the comical Morton, the adorable Katie and the equally adorable Good Vlad the rabbit who appears very briefly towards the end. Bad Vlad the vulture was not quite as frightening as he looked but I liked his change of heart towards the end as well as that of Kangaroo's. Most of the characters and the backgrounds are surreal yet vibrantly coloured but the scenes of Jo-Jo sneaking out and the introduction of Bad Vlad are dull in colour. In addition to the humour and intelligence, the writing also has superb snippets of rhyming narrative that was an essential staple of Seuss's books. The film also has some pleasant surprises such as Carol Burnett (Miss Hannigan in the 1982 film adaptation of 'Annie') providing Kangaroo's voice, Jo-Jo shouting, ""Yop!"" to make the Who's chanting and music more audible to Horton and the other animals and squeaky-voiced comedian Joe Pasquale providing the dentist's voice. Further to the voice acting, Jim Carrey and Steve Carell (both of whom had previously appeared in 'Bruce Almighty') voice Horton and the Mayor of Whoville impeccably while Seth Rogen is a hoot as Morton. While the ending of the zooming-out from the jungle is effective, I would personally have changed it to show Horton placing the speck on the sunflower.Overall, this is the best animated adaptation of a Dr Seuss book I have seen so far, closely followed by 'The Lorax (2012 CGI version)' and 'Daisy-Head Mayzie' but preferable to the Warner Bros adaptation of 'Horton Hatches the Egg.' 8/10."
66,Horton Hears a Who!,8,17 April 2008,"Charming, top tier CG to rival Pixar",A really nice adaptation of Horton here which really puts the Dreamworks movies to shame hitting a near perfect balance between sweet and funny. The pacing is kind of strange for the first 20 minutes or so almost like it is too excited to tell it's story but it really picks up after the mission is started and the spot on kids anime parody shows it's head. This is a real pleasant surprise for a non Pixar CG film. I would say it even betters the likes of 'Cars' and 'A Bug's life'. I don't know what the studio has planned next but I'm looking forward to it and will probably actually go to the cinema for the next one.
67,Horton Hears a Who!,8,16 April 2008,"Jin Carrey is fantastic as always, and brings this great adaptation to life!","A great adaptation of the popular Seuss story, with fantastic animation & screenplay. The undertones of the original story are depicted well in the film as well, which is always a good sign! Jim Carrey is once again phenomenal playing the charming &...(read more) funny Horton.This movie may not be a classic like 'Nemo' & Lion King, but is still entertaining enough for adults & excellent for children, though a few characters in the film could've been explored further. However the general look and animation of the feature is fantastic. It has vibrant colors complemented superbly by the various characters in the film.Overall, a great family movie with a great lesson, typical of the great Dr. Seuss!"
68,Horton Hears a Who!,8,11 April 2008,A person is a person no matter how small,"This is the only Dr. Seuss movie that I've seen and it is a really good adaptation. I passed watching 'The Grinch' because at that time, I felt like it was too weird for me. Even weirder than Tim Burton's works and that's saying a lot. Mike Myers' 'Cat in the Hat' was panned by critics and Dr. Seuss' fans alike so that was no for me too. I decided to watch this flick mainly because it stayed strong in the box-office for a couple of weeks and the critics were really impressed. So yeah, I watched it and I too, was impressed. The animations are lavish, the story: top notch, the humor and jokes were also there not only kids humor but they also put some adult humor for the mature audience. The voice cast was perfect, every animal they're voicing fits their personality really well. And of course, the moral of the story. A person is a person no matter how small.Cute. 8/10"
69,Horton Hears a Who!,6,8 September 2014,Good movie IF you watch on DVD...,"...so you can skip the really stupid/annoying bits. The bits in question may be fine for kids, but for an adult they are excruciatingly annoying. I strongly recommend ejecting the DVD once the final musical number starts. There's nothing that follows that is in any way relevant to the story. On the other hand, parts of this movie are laugh out loud funny so it is worth watching. As with many kids movies, the moral gets laid on a bit thick, but usually not enough to be annoying. The animation is great and the ""Seuss-ness"" of the images is pretty well reproduced.It is unfortunate that most of the annoying bits weren't left on the cutting room floor. The movie would be so much better without them. I suspect the only reason they were included was to bring the movie up to its still short 86 minutes. In my opinion, they should have aimed for a 70-minute run time and offered it at a lower price, but that's probably not feasible.My rating completely depends on your ability to edit while watching. I give it a 6 if you can and a 4 if you can't."
70,Horton Hears a Who!,8,18 June 2014,This film has one of the strongest moral and sweetest story ever!,"The animation is so pretty and realistic, especially the flowers like dandelions and clovers but not the 2D imaginations that's going on Horton's mind, which I find it irrelevant and non-matching to the film as a whole. Nonetheless, there are still so much wit, fun and tension throughout the film which is quite pleasing and entertaining. Other than possibly being the best Dr. Seuss adaptation, this film has one of the strongest moral and sweetest story ever. Most of the time, it is exciting, touching and inspiring. Horton the Elephant certainly have a big heart and serves as a role model to the rest in the jungle of Nool (and the rest of us too).On who will like this...it's difficult to brain who will not like this but most children and people who love Dr. Seuss books will certainly love this film! PS. Katie the baby yak and Rudy the baby kangaroo are so adorable!"
71,Horton Hears a Who!,8,10 April 2011,Terrifc Dr Seuss adaptation,"I have always been a fan of Dr Seuss's funny and charming stories, but the adaptations of his work have had mixed results. There are timeless classics such as 1966's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, but there are also abominations such as 2003's The Cat in the Hat.Horton Hears a Who! is one of the better adaptations of Dr Seuss's work, and succeeds amazingly well on its own terms. While aspects of the story are occasionally predictable and clichéd, and one or two of the character relationships could have been less obvious, it is colourful and hilarious entertainment for both children and adults, which compared to what it could've been is quite an achievement.Even with the predictable and clichéd moments, Horton Hears a Who!'s story is a simple and entertaining one well done. This is further advantaged by fast pacing, funny and smart writing that stays reasonably loyal to Dr Seuss's style and very likable characters.There is a lively vocal cast on board too, Jim Carrey shows he is great at comedy as well as drama and manages to be endearing as well as funny. Steve Carrell is great fun too, and it was delight to hear Annie's Carol Burnett in a supporting role. The soundtrack is infectious as well, but what made Horton Hears a Who! other than the humour was the animation, which is very clean, colourful and beautiful to look at.All in all, a terrific film. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
72,Horton Hears a Who!,9,2 August 2009,"cute, funny, one of Dr.Seuss's best films. Not far from The Grinch.","I loved How the Grinch Stole Christmas back in 2000. I hated The Cat in the Hat back in 2003. Five years after the Cat in the Hat comes Horton Hears a who, a very funny and original Dr. Seuss film. it surpass's THe Cat in the Hat in every way. It isn't far away from being better than The Grinch. Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, Will Arnet, Carol Burnett,and others lend their voice to this clever animation. Of course Dr. Seuss wrote it. But to make the film longer, they added a bit to it. Carrey plays Horton the elephant. One day he finds a speck and he hears a voice. This is the voice of the mayor of who-ville(Steve Carell). THe Kangaroo(Carol Burnett) tries to force Horton to get rid of it but he refuses. So she goes to Vlad(Will Arnet), a vulture who is hired to kill anything. She hires him to kill the speck. Horton tries to save Who-Ville in a desperate quest through the jungle of Nool. Horton Hears a who doesn't disappoint. It actually is very impressive. It is a creative story and film, filled with tons of visuals. Horton hears a who is a near perfect film."
73,Horton Hears a Who!,9,9 June 2009,Good Show..(finally) Worthy of Suess in 2009...,"A good show...for practically anyone...er' any age, I mean...for a lot of folks (even an ol' buzzard)...it'll be: "" Emotional...Well, here come the water-slide""...This script is crafted so well, inter-weaved with everything from outright lessons to some 'nearly subliminal' messages...""So let that be a lesson to one and to all...a person's a person - no matter how small""...I developed & created a natl.

Bottom line is: It's well-worth the watch and the quality is all over this one...a classic adaptation of a classic master..."
74,Horton Hears a Who!,8,17 May 2009,Wow!,"OK, so this film has been around for a year, but I saw it for the first time tonight. It is fantastic! I can remember the old cartoon version and Horton, the Wickershams and Kangaroo have all been translated into CGI brilliantly! And the Whos are exactly how they should be! And the voice-casting was perfect. This is the best kid's film I have seen in a long, long time! I'm a huge Disney fan but they haven't really been delivering for some time.... Yes ""Bolt"" was good, but it wasn't classic Disney. This film reminds me of ""Shrek"" in a way because when that first came out everyone was saying how it was up there with the best of Disney. I believe ""Horton Hears A Who!"" is up there too! (Yeah! Go ryhmes!) I would have liked it to have had some of the little songs from the original, but apart from that little detail, this is an absolute joy for the whole family! Dr. Seuss would be proud!"
75,Horton Hears a Who!,8,9 June 2008,Excellent family entertainment--and thank goodness it doesn't stray too far from the source material.,"Okay, many of you are about to become offended, but I've gotta say it. The movie version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (THE GRINCH) was a horrible movie in practically every way. The worst problem with it is that the entire moral lesson of the original story is lost and in fact the movie states the exact opposite of what the author intended!! In the book and Chuck Jones special, the Whos were nice folks that didn't need all the presents as they were sincere in their reverence for the holidays. In the Jim Carey remake, the Whos were all selfish and materialistic!! What a horrible way to ruin Dr. Seuss' vision! It's like translating the Bible and making Satan the good guy!In light of how far THE GRINCH strayed, I especially loved HORTON HEARS A WHO because it didn't wander far from the source material or convolute the moral of the story. Sure, the story was changed a bit and several subplots were added, but I could accept this--after all, they had about 88 minutes to fill and there had to be SOME padding. However, the original story can still easily be distinguished and perhaps after this film, Seuss can finally stop spinning in his grave!!So, apart from the faithfulness to the original story, what did I like? Well, I was once again thrilled to see Fox making CGI films. Their ICE AGE films were pretty good and HORTON is even prettier and more entertaining. Quality-wise, this is about on-par with a Pixar or Dreamworks production. I particularly loved Whoville--as with powerful computers, they were able to animate hundreds, if not thousands, of wonderful Whos. And it was cute all the little tiny touches--so much so that the film holds up well to repeated viewing in order to catch all the action and details. Plus the town looked very Seuss-ian--like the pages of the books come to life. It was a real joy to watch.Was there anything I didn't like? Well, the song at the end by REO Speedwagon was simply terrible way to wrap up the film. It was schmaltzy and pointless and looked as if the producers were stuck finding a decent way to tie everything together. However, considering this is my only gripe, then this is still a heck of a film--one the kids AND parents can enjoy. Kids will love it and parents will actually not be bored--a rare achievement in a film."
76,Horton Hears a Who!,7,23 May 2008,Nice colorful and very moralistic film,"Horton the elephant lives his life fooling around in the forest together with his friends. The major of Whoville runs his town and family. The two have nothing to do with each other and don't even know of each others existence until some events gets everything rolling: the dust speck the Whos live on breaks loose from the flower it rests on and ends up with Horton who decides to protect it.For an animation film this one is quite nice: the color palette is beautiful and the animated sequences are lively. Story wise it's a bit out of this time in my opinion for it is so moralistic it becomes a bit of a parody. The whole tale revolves around the tiny Whos who refuse to believe there exists anything outside their world because they cannot see or hear it and the friends of the elephant that cannot believe in the existence of a world of creatures living on a dust speck because they cannot see or hear them.Of course that is just the point of the original story and so it has been adapted well, and for its projected audience - the younger kids - it works out well enough. It might have included some extra jokes and things for the adults though. No good to have all parents fall asleep in the cinema.7 out of 10 tiny elephants"
77,Horton Hears a Who!,10,25 April 2008,Amazing.,"I am fifteen years old and I went to see this movie with my nineteen year old sister and her twenty year old friend. I am pleased to say that we laughed pretty much the whole way through. That shows a lot about this movie; no matter how old you are, you will laugh a lot. I would recommend this masterpiece to anyone. It's getting harder and harder to find a kid's movie that appeals to everyone, but Horton Hears a Who does. The fluffy thing and Jo Jo will honestly put you in a great mood for the week.I could go on and on about how fantastic this movie is, but really, haven't all the Dr Seuss movies been great so far?"
78,Horton Hears a Who!,9,23 April 2008,Hoton Gives a Side-Slplitting Laugh,"I laughed out loud, I smiled inside. There is a little personal story behind the smile. For some time there has been a lack of relationship in the relationship with my 17 year old nephew. We don't see each other much and and talk even less. He is very 'unemotional' on the outside. What a grand smile I had just being with him. The visible pleasure was most satisfying. As to the actual movie, it has something for everyone. The animated action got laughs all round but I think we, the big people, got the best deal of all. My 9 year old niece was with us. She started laughing at the music bit at the end. She laughed because we laughed. She loves music and that made it fun but it was the adults that laughed because of the genre. As they say Horton rocks!!!"
79,Horton Hears a Who!,8,22 April 2008,This review is about a kid's movie,"This review is about a kid's movie.Yeah, right (both literally and sarcastically) It is a movie review but rather than being a childish animated movie, I can say for sure that this gem of a movie is so much larger than what you can ever imagine, more significant than any big-budget Hollywood starring-your-favourite-actor movie, much louder than any whinny Akon/Sean Kingston song, more impactful than your accounting+science textbooks put together and much funnier than your typical slapstick movies.Ironically, the movie's main characters are carried by two most peculiar but 'funny as' individuals - Jim Carrey and Steve Carell - these guys started off with toilet jokes, how did they get involved in something so massive? I guess it all started when they took on the lead roles in Bruce Almighty and Evan Almighty.The plot is simple, yet the message is profounding - An elephant, Horton (Jim Carrey) struggles to protect this world in which the 'Whos' live in, which is contained in a tiny speck on a little daffodil. The Mayor of the Whoville (Steve Carell) finds out about this parallel universe larger than his and only he knows of the existence of Horton. Bpth characters try to save themselves as well as their own kind by attempting to communicate to the others that there is life more than life itself.Go watch the movie and figure out what that big message is; I sure hope you will get it. Here is a headstart for you, taken (sort of) from a line from the movie: 'Just because we can't see it, hear it, nor touch it doesn't mean it doesn't exist'"
80,Horton Hears a Who!,9,27 March 2008,"sweet, scary, charming and memorable overall!","Super cute! Horton Hears a Who! is sweet, scary, charming and memorable overall! Horton the elephant (Jim Carrey) lives in a jungle as some sort of kindergarten teacher. He comes across a speck and realizes that there may be life (perhaps an entire universe!) on it! Against all odds, he makes it his mission to bring the speck to safety.While I was not familiar at all with this particular book or its plot, I was raised on Dr. Seuss' books and always found his characters unique, intriguing and imaginative.I enjoyed the trip down memory lane. Seeing this movie as an adult, I appreciated the attempts at modernizing some of the dialogue, costume design and dream sequences (like the momentary switch to anime style) to make it more relevant to today's kids. But the humor continues to appeal to adults as well, who may grow wistful for the time when it was possible for bad times to be undone and good to prevail. The not-often-glorified theme of kindness is made the utmost priority, and this is what establishes this story as a classic.Horton the elephant's mantra of faithfulness to his word, and upholding his belief of ""a person's a person, no matter how small!"" despite threats to his very life is refreshing to see in popular culture, especially in cinemas. Even better is how well received it was at the tills, and how, despite the stellar cast that includes Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell (Bruce and Evan Almighty, respectively!), the characters were able to shine on their own without being distracted by the celebrities behind the voices.Also charming is seeing Seuss' characters and set design maintain their whimsical, anything-is-possible-in-this-world look. The execution of this flick perfectly connects parents who grew up on Dr. Seuss and the children who now also get to enjoy his stories."
81,Horton Hears a Who!,8,26 March 2008,Easy watching fun family movie,"I went to see Horton... with my wife and two kids, aged 5 and 3. We had just read Horton... in Dr. Seuss's bedtime stories, so my kids were amazed to see it appearing in film form.I really enjoyed the movie and felt that it was not too 'in-your-face' with try-hard gags and mayhem, but always kept the viewer interested, with an ongoing story that swapped between the jungle and (I am not allowed to write the town name).My 5 year old loved it, partly because of his interest in Seuss and partly because of the engaging story/characters/animation. My 3 year old lost interest occasionally, but that I feel is more her than the movie (preffering real-life movies).An element I liked in the movie was the moral - that individuals can get 'sucked in' to disliking another individual, and that it can all go to far, and that forgiveness can be found even after suffering victimisation and hate. Some of the characters were great, especially the Whoville Mayor's son, Jo-Jo, Vlad the vulture, and both Carrey and Carrell did a good job as Horton and the Mayor.The movie must have been about 90 minutes (just enough). The animation was great and it really was a relaxing, easy-watching family movie. I'd consider purchasing it on DVD and would be happy to watch (with my kids) it again."
82,Horton Hears a Who!,8,24 March 2008,A very nice surprise,"I went to see Horton Hears a Who with very low expectations and I have to say the film totally surpassed them.This movie is not a great animation film but I have to admit I liked it pretty much.I laughed on various occasions in this movie,specially in the excellent satire to the anime (Japanese animation) and the film tells a very good story.As a fail I found on this movie,I think that,on some occasions,the film has very exaggerated humor and,on that moments,the humor did not flow too well.The other fails are not too important.As I said,I went to see this movie with very low expectations but the film enormously entertained me.It's not a great animation film,like Ratatouille or The Incredibles,but it's infinitely better than craps like Open Season or Bee Movie.I recommend this movie to kids and to their parents.I had a very good time with Horton Hears a Who."
83,Horton Hears a Who!,7,21 March 2008,Fairly decent Seussian adaptation of kids of all ages,"HORTON HEARS A WHO! (2008) **1/2 (Voices of: Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, Carol Burnett, Isla Fisher, Amy Poehler, Will Arnett, Seth Rogen, Dan Fogler, Jonah Hill, Jaime Pressly, Charles Osgood  narrator) Big-screen animated adaptation of Dr. Seuss' classic children's tale about a good-hearted elephant named Horton (Carrey actually dialing it down several levels thankfully) who comes across a microscopic town in a speck on a flower and attempts to convince the jungle community they exist. The eclectic comic talent shine as does the animation in general getting Seuss' characters to remain in their iconic drawn-line schism yet the screenplay by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul feels strained in the padding for a full-length feature yet directing team Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino wisely keep things lively for all ages to enjoy."
84,Horton Hears a Who!,1,20 March 2008,propaganda,"I have not walked out on a movie in awhile. I actually loved Golden Compass and thought that film was not anti-Christian and was good adventure. But this Horton film is pure anti-family propaganda. It is a pathetic attempt to take the joy and innocence from kids by appealing to them through cute animal figures. But it sneers at the idea of family and has an underlying attitude of mocking. We have another pathetic father figure. Then we see the film mock the idea of respect for ancestors and belittle and make fun of family history. This strikes at the heart of kids and destroys youth through the death of a thousand cuts year after year of making fun of good things by wimpy self hating type film makers. This is beyond politically correct. We left and saw the surprisingly fun 10,000 years BC. Don't believe the bad reviews on that one."
85,Horton Hears a Who!,3,14 March 2008,"MPAA High, Repeated Peril","Why do we continue to traumatize children with characters who are mean to each other, who threaten each other.If you want to expose your children to injury and death threats in scene after scene, take them to this movie.If you want them to come home afraid to stand up for themselves, afraid to voice their opinions... take them to this film, because that's the lesson that they will learn.Slapstick humor does not substitute for insight or cultural commentary.And ""it all works out in the end"" does not excuse for my 3-year old saying ""Why did *** keep trying to kill ***?""Why does Hollywood think the ""end"" excuses the ""means""? The means are the whole film. The end is boring and swiftly forgotten. What's left over is a lesson instilled in millions of children: ""don't stand out... don't have your own opinions... it will be hard and dangerous for you if you do..."".Please do not see this movie with any child under 6."
86,Horton Hears a Who!,4,24 October 2011,"This Movie Sucks, This Movie Sucks, This Movie SUCKS!!!","This film, out of all of the Dr. Seuss movies, not only had the closest look to the original source material, but it looks amazing. And, I was like, ""Hey, they actually did it. This actually looks like a Dr. Seuss movie done in computer animation."" I was very impressed by it.But, no matter how great an animated film looks, it can only be good as its story. And, my God, did they screw that one up, big time.Not the actual story itself, that's fine. It's the pop culture references that they just dumped into this film. Really? Are you that afraid that you may lose the adults that you have to sledgehammer those stupid jokes in? And, the sad part about it is that there were moments in the film that actually felt like it came straight out of the books that this was adapted from. I mean, I understand it's a short book, but you didn't have to fill it up with these things that make no sense to the story. Or, worse, distracts you from it!Now, I didn't mind them adding Jim Carry's shtick to Norton's personally, although I felt it would have been better if they didn't. So, because of that, he was sort of amusing to watch, although, sometimes, I just drop my head in embarrassment as some of the things he does. But, I did think that Steve Carrel did a good job, himself. In fact, I actually thought the two actors were doing such a good job working off each other that it actually felt natural.But, as soon as those moments were gone, we get some of those good ol' pop culture references. Like that anime sequence that makes no sense because how does Norton's know what anime is. Was there a television in the background, somewhere?Now, in case you don't see my rating at the top, I'm just going to prematurely tell you my rating of this movie is a two. And, yes, I know that my review, up to this point, sounded like it should have been higher, like a six. Well, let me tell you why I gave this a two.As this movie was about to wrap itself up, I was thinking, ""Hey, you know what, it wasn't great, but I thought it was nice and those pop culture references, as annoying as they were, they weren't that bad."" Then, as if a hand came out of the screen and b***h-slap me, they have to end the film with a song. And, to make matters worse, they animated it like a music video. Why? What, in God's name, does it have to do with the movie? What is the point of it? What message does it convey, besides showing how NOT to end a movie that is tightroping on a line of mediocrity? Now, if it was a song that was originally made for this movie, I would have just let it go. However, after of plethora of stupid pop culture references, I would be very surprise if that song didn't aired on the radio years ago. Well, guess what, it was a hit by REO Speedwagon back in 1985 called ""Can't Fight This Feeling."" Wow, how ironic.And, do you remember that cute little character named Jojo? Well, in the beginning, I knew that he was voiced by Jesse McCartney. You know, Justin Beiber's predecessor? Well, he only had about three or four lines in this movie, as the character of Jojo was silent through most of the time. And, as soon as that...f'ing scene came up, he gets to sing a solo line. And, that's when I began to think that they only got him just so they can do this scene. Or, since he is primarily known as a singer, they just want to throw him a bone and let him sing a little. Either way, it doesn't work. No, wait a minute, it does work. In that it made it even more worse!And, that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I gave this a two. I was willing to let it be as it is, but because they ended this movie on such a horrific note, that is so God-awful, that it made me reject the film as a whole because it felt like it was leading up to that moment. A song that has no business to be in a Dr. Seuss movie. A song that doesn't even match with what they were doing. Except that I can't fight my feelings I have for this crappy movie!Yes, the animation is great, and it does have its moments, but it was hijacked from the very beginning by writers who seemed to have little or no respect for the source material. I wish to give it more stars, but every time I think about this movie, I kept thinking about that stupid ending and how it left a terrible taste in my mouth. And, after three years, I'm still trying to wash it out. That's how much I hate this movie."
87,Horton Hears a Who!,10,2 June 2009,The very idea of the movie is enthralling,"I was not aware of Dr. Seuss' writing, so I did not hear anything about Horton. Then, I was absolutely captivated by this endearing elephant. The movie has some in between the line layers, which are quite obvious to the adult viewer, but they are completely hidden from the children audience, its true destination. A child will learn to position himself relatively to others, just as Horton did with the Whos. He will learn also that he has to defend his ideas, and to be affirmative against his peers, just as Horton and Whosville's mayor were. Last but not least, we, the adults, should regard the smallest child as a dear asset, one that could save our entire world, as did JoJo."
88,Horton Hears a Who!,9,20 March 2008,"After watching this i said to myself ""pixar have competition""","hi it's the 14 year old film fanatic again and this is my review for Horton Hears A Who! Growing up i loved Dr. Seuss. Even at a young age i thought that cat in the hat and the grinch were massacaring his work. I knew that the work of seuss could only be done animated and finally my favourite dr. seuss story horton hears a who has made it's way into the animated world.I might start comparing this film to Chuck Jonses' animation of horton so bear with me please.Horton the elephant lives in the jungle of nool and one day he hears a noise on a speck. He befriends the small civilizations mayor and tries to take the ""Whos world to safety"" Horton is met with much anger and controversy from the rest of the jungle animals beleiving that there is no other civilization beyond their own.Horton hears a who is a fantastic film and even very mature adults will love it.The animation is well done and the effects on water and especially fur is the best since Monsters Inc.Horton remains very true to seuss' story and even the little things like the famous ""YOPP"" are never left out.Another thing i noticed is that most of the whos have very similar motions to chuck jonses' adaption which is great mainly because you have a combination of great rising star company blue sky with one of the worlds best animators.After seeing this i thought that pixar would definitely have competition now. But i know that when the highly anticipated Wall.E comes out those thoughts will be crushed when it comes Oscar season again.overall a great film for kids and adults and makes you think about life and the question of god etc etc"
89,Horton Hears a Who!,,20 March 2008,I love Horton today and forever,"I have not seen the new movie yet. I have an original pull string Horton from 1970. I use to talk about Horton Hears a Who all the time growing up. No one knew what I was talking about. Now that he is a big star maybe all my friends will understand that I wasn't that crazy for keeping a stuffed elephant that long. He use to talk but hasn't in years. I think bringing back childhood characters from long ago is a great idea. I hope to see the movie this week-end and I know it will be just as great as the, book I know if it is anything like the Grinch movie then it will alive for a long time. I think Jim Carey is just wonderful. Thanks Kimberly"
90,Horton Hears a Who!,8,17 March 2008,Horton hears that someone likes his film!,"Horton Hears a Who! is a tremendous animated film. I first heard this from an interview with Jim Carrey at The Number 23 premiere like a half year ago. I checked it out and then I saw the voice cast and I was like: I must see this cause it has Jim and Steve Carrell in it. Then I saw it, I was laughing, enjoying myself at the theater. It was good and may be the best animated film in 2008 (although, we haven't seen Kung Fu Panda or Madagascar 2). If you haven't seen it, go out, see it. I'm not gonna give away any plot details. Watch both trailers before you it though. I hope they make a sequel, but this is based on a book so I have no idea if the book has a follower, but hey, anything is possible. Tremendous story with good characters, comedy and animation.So I give Horton hears a Who! an 8.1/10"
91,Horton Hears a Who!,6,18 December 2009,"Good cinematography, with some serious sexist flaws","Cinematographically, this is a fine film. The insertion of the actual Seuss verses works well, the actors are good, and the animation is great. However, I have some serious issues with this film that would preclude me from using it as a teacher or a parent. I don't know if these issues reflect the original Seuss story or if they are part of the screenplay adaptation. Either way, they are unnecessary. Take the Mayor's 96 children, only one of which is a boy. With 95 girls and 1 boy you would certainly think that a girl child would be statistically more likely to be the engineer who built the megaphone machine and hence the hero of the film. But no, it's the boy. Then there is the complete absence of any healthy female role models in the movie. Whereas males are gentle heroes (the mayor and Horton especially), females are only shrill shrew (the kangaroo mom), passive wife/mother (Mayor's wife), frumpy ""old maid"" personal assistant, or de-individuated (the Mayor's dozens of daughters). These two issues alone are seriously problematic, even disturbing, in a film made in 2008."
92,Horton Hears a Who!,5,6 September 2009,For Whom The Who Tolls,"HORTON HEARS A WHO! is a Dr. Seuss tale about Horton the elephant in the jungle of Nool, discovering a microscopic city called Whoville on a speck of dust, and vowing to the microscopic mayor to transport the speck to a safe place in the jungle.An animated feature that kids will enjoy and adults will find tiresome, HORTON lacks the charm of WALL-E, the verve of SURF'S UP and the bravado of CORALINE. But it does have Jim Carrey (voicing Horton) and Steve Carell (voicing the Mayor).The nominal villain is Kangaroo (Carol Burnett), who riles Horton on his ""imaginary city,"" maintaining he's a bad influence on the youth, employing a vulture (Will Arnett) to destroy the speck of dust, while campaigning against Horton with rousing, fact-free speeches to mobs of apes (like Sarah Palin at any given Republican rally).Yet Horton persists, ""I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful one hundred percent."" Palin's credo is, ""If you can't see or hear or feel something, it doesn't exist."" Which is true, from an anthropocentric position, touching on Einsteinian physics and Descartian philosophy. While Horton goes Eastern religion: ""After all, a person is a person, no matter how small."" Visualization of Dr. Seuss's graphics is astounding; eye-popping colors swirl and mash your brain, and there is a short cartoon segment that emulates his drawings exactly. There's also a crazy yellow thing called Katie that should make dumb kids laugh and give smart kids nightmares. Seth Rogen voices Morton, a blue mouse-thing, Dan Fogler is a Who Councilman and Isla Fisher is Dr. Mary Lou Larue, who hits on the film's best concept - the plurality of worlds, and how every speck of dust is a world unto itself.HORTON is one of those animated features (like CHICKEN LITTLE, SHREK) that squeezes in a completely irrelevant popular song for its closing number, for all the characters to perform in wondrous joyousness that makes our flesh crawl. HORTON ends gratuitously with REO Speedwagon's Can't Fight This Feeling. If you're going to squash a square song into a round movie, I'd rather hear a Who - the real The Who.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."
93,Horton Hears a Who!,,2 July 2008,Actually better than Wall-E,Call me crazy but I prefer this movie over Wall-E. The visuals were not as breaktaking yes but the sweet and simple storyline is so heart touching that you gotta love it. The characters are extremely cute and the plot beautiful. Horton's motto of a person is a person no matter how small is what makes this movie gold. And the ending makes me want to cry.I won't go too much into the plot because I don't want to spoil it for anybody but this movie is a must see and your kids and yourself will love it.My overall score is 10/10
94,Horton Hears a Who!,10,21 March 2008,"awesome,creative and a must watch movie...","After Matrix,I think this is a movie with gives another view of the world we are living we are in. Though not as sci-fi as matrix but from a simple,creative and innovative perspective.It's fun ,laughter all along the movie and when you are finished watching the movie who will definitely be compelled to view our world in a different way. I recommend the readers to watch this movie with family,kids and don't bother if certain parts of the movie doesn't make sense at all.Just relax and enjoy the big picture and don't trouble yourself going into small details.This would surely be satisfying watch after few disappointing movies this year."
95,Horton Hears a Who!,6,24 March 2008,it was kinda random,"well I went into the movie excited to see this movie but it had some pretty random points, it was a good movie but i would pick quite a few of children animated movies that are funnier and more interesting! And did anyone got the hint of Jo Jo being an typical ""EMO"" kid???? that teaches our children great things, but then i guess he finally believes in the end and speaks! so does that mean hes going to talk now? but the overall plot was good, but thats only because it came from the book, it was good animation. The actors voices made the movie, there was a bunch of random stupid stuff that should not have been in there, like the little yellow animal that was not with it in the head, and and the break when Horton goes into this comic book fighting thing was random, it was worth my 6 dollars but anything else is pushing it."
96,Horton Hears a Who!,,24 March 2008,Could have been better,"Children don't need this information. They just need to be taught the right way to live so they can ascend as young as possible. But this necessitates positive moral guidance by the parents, and as corrupt as people are today this is the exception rather than the norm. Because of this, sadly, it is best for children to accept this limitation, understand and depart rather than stay and continually incurr evil as they live their lives. My family is a very sad case. My mother and others in my family gave the gods carte blanche with this family, and this has ensured our children will DEMAND to know why, for boss corrupts them at a very tender age. They took a very creative, disturbing and destructive approach to accomplish this but the gods have casted my family into damnation."
97,Horton Hears a Who!,3,10 April 2008,Horton Hears a Who Gives A Crud About This Flick,"An imaginative elephant named Horton (Jim Carrey) hears a faint cry for help coming from a tiny speck of dust floating through the air. Although Horton doesn't know it yet, that speck houses an entire city named Who-ville, inhabited by the microscopic Whos, led by the Mayor (Steve Carell). Despite being ridiculed and threatened by his neighbors who think he has lost his mind, Horton is determined to save the particle... because ""a person's a person no matter how small."" It was very dull and boring just couldn't get into this very much piece of crap-eeo. My advice:Please avoid this movie. it is worse then House Of Wax. Horton Hears a Who! 3/10"
98,Horton Hears a Who!,10,16 July 2013,"Hugely underrated, somewhat of a spoiler","People need to review things for what they are. This isn't The Shawshank Redemption but it is excellent for what it is. I love all sorts of movies including animated movies.This one is done excellently. It is visually great and very funny. It is the type of movie that I can watch with my son and we both enjoy it.I do have one big complaint and it comes at the end. I actually don't like the message that is sent by instantly forgiving the kangaroo. I know that it is supposed to be inclusive but some people, or kangaroos as the case might be, give up their right to be included.She's horrible to Horton, incites people to cage him and kill his friends and she suffers zero consequences. If children can handle the part of her attempting to kill his friends and caging him, I think they could handle her being in trouble for it."
99,Horton Hears a Who!,7,24 June 2013,Not bad,"I didn't expect to like this movie, but I actually did and would recommend it to anyone. Was it perfect? No, but it didn't slaughter the name of Dr. Seuss like most people expected it to. It's hard to take a children's book, especially a Dr. Seuss, and create a more elaborate storyline for it and it turn out to actually be good. I will say that as much as I love the actors that play the main characters, some of them didn't seem to fit their characters. That doesn't mean it still wasn't enjoyable, it just seemed a tad bit off to me. But I do recommend this for a good rainy, movie night type of day. It will keep you entertained from start to finish and you do begin to care about the characters and what happens to them."
100,Horton Hears a Who!,9,4 May 2013,Horton demonstrates his faith and belief in himself by aiding a tiny speck that is full of life.,"Horton Hears a Who! is an animated comedic adventure of Horton, the elephant, played by Jim Carrey, who is trying to carry a Mayor, played by Steve Carrel, and all the Whoville citizens to safety. At the same time, Kangaroo, played by Carol Burnett, tries to prevent Horton from being successful. Whoville happens to be a very small town that is located on a speck, and Horton is the only animal in the forest who can hear them. Kangaroo believes that Horton is making this entire town up and believes that imagination is bad for children. I believe the theme of this movie is faith and belief. Horton has faith and belief in his ears, himself, and the Mayor of Whoville; he knows that the Whos need help and will bend over backwards to deliver that help. The Mayor of Whoville has faith and belief in Horton as well, and through this story, he learns to have more faith in himself and his son, JoJo. Kangaroo, who does not believe anything unless she can see it, hear it, and feel it, knows that Horton is wrong and thinks that she must get him to side with her (Hayward & Martino, 2008). It is not until everyone hears the Whos that she finally realizes she is wrong. I think most of the animals would have sided with and helped Horton, if it had not been for Kangaroo stirring up trouble and persuading everyone to take her side, or else. The faith and belief in this movie reminds me of The NeverEnding Story; both Bastion and Atreyu had to have faith in themselves and one another to help the Empress and save her land, Fantasia. The characters in both Horton Hears a Who! and The NeverEnding Story must strive to keep their faith even when everything seems lost. It is through faith and belief that these heroes persevere.Kangaroo can be said to contain faith and belief; unfortunately, her faith and belief is that she is always right and knows what is best for everyone in the forest. Mainly, what is good for everyone, according to Kangaroo, is that she be listened to, and they can either conform to her ideals or pay the piper, so to speak. In one scene, lighting was used in such a way that it reflected Kangaroo's anger towards Horton. Kangaroo was trying to convince all the animals that Horton must be stopped; that his actions would cause the youngsters to think, and this in turn would lead to anarchy. The sky was a dark and menacing purple/pink color; it seemed to swirl and stew, just like the anger Kangaroo had for Horton. Another example of Horton's continuous faith and belief was the statement, ""a person's a person, no matter how small,"" throughout the film (Hayward & Martino, 2008). I believe it was this statement, heard by Rudy, Kangaroo's son, that gave Rudy the strength to save the Whos from a boiling hot death and to stand up to his mom for what he knew was right. I also believe that Rudy would have saved the Whos even if he had not heard them. I believe that Horton Hears a Who! is a great example of how we should live our lives. An imagination is good; as is positivity, but if we are unable to have faith in ourselves, then we might be easily swayed by the Kangaroos in this world. We will always run into obstacles and be faced with tough decisions, but it is through faith and belief that we can persevere. References Hayward, J., & Martino, S. (Directors). (2008).

101,Horton Hears a Who!,9,24 November 2012,Stays True To the Book!,"Dr. Seuss's Horton Hears a Who! is a wonderful adaptation of the original novel and it captures the heart and spirit of it which is very rare these days. Often, while they are made with good intentions and are often entertaining, movie adaptations from books often lack the heart of the book. Also, this film stays pure to the book which is also rare.This film is about an elephant who finds about a town of Whos living on a speck of dust. Now his mission is to take the speck to a safe place before their world is destroyed while evading the evil kangaroo.The voice acting is great. The comedy pair-up of Jim Carrey and Steve Carell works in the film quite a bit!Overall, this is a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. The animation is lovely to look at. I think the cast and crew of this film should give themselves a pat on the back for making a delightful film. I rate this film 9/10."
102,Horton Hears a Who!,7,23 November 2012,Jim Carrey is hilarious!,Jim Carrey has always been one of my favorite comedians as he is able to express himself so insanely and hilariously. He is by far the best voice actor for children's movies. He is just so talented it is a very believable voice and gives a great quality to whatever he is doing a voice for.This movie is about an elephant in the jungle named Horton who thinks he hears a voice coming out of a small flower. No one else in the jungle can hear it because their small ears but Horton discovers a small thing on it and this is a village of them apparently called whos.This is a really good family movie Jim Carrey is the real reason why it is so good he is truly the star.
103,Horton Hears a Who!,7,1 May 2012,Unique story but beware of the political messages!,"I must first confess that it took me several days, almost a week, to watch the movie. The reason being that the DVD I watched it from was scratched and so I couldn't see halfway through. So a week later I got a different one and watched it again, this time seeing the rest of the film. So my true feelings of the movie kind of disappeared but in general I still have my opinions on it.First, it's definitely unique. Yet it's annoyingly political, which doesn't surprise me. It's a story about believing in something that you cannot see, hear or taste or smell or touch. And the character who does witness a sound from the speck is considered a fool and it comes to the point where he is actually threatened to lose his own life possibly or at least be injured for his views.The reason? A kangaroo who has a negative attitude about everything, like some political parties I know. Anyway, she refuses to accept any new ideas such as a speck containing life and because of that she tries to banish the elephant who does. A few things that bothered me include her use of ""homes school"" which was inappropriate. She used it after her son asked to play with the kids and she refused, saying he had to not be brainwashed by the silly views that the others had.This is rude because I (as I've admitted in another review for the movie RV) home school and find it wrong to make a bland assumption that home schoolers restrict themselves from the rest of the world like that. Some do, but so do public schoolers. Anyway that drove me mad but in general her negative attitude was annoying but it helped with the plot. And of course I found everyone's acceptance to quickly go and join and believe in the kangaroo's views so easily kind of fake and annoying, and in the end when..SPOILER BELOW... she finally does hear the voices and is shocked and is just sad. I mean, she goes all that way to prove she's right and then that happens? With her attitude I'd come up with an excuse and dismiss it, demanding visual proof until ultimately the small guys on the speck are able to grow (or these with the speck and the flower shrink) and then she'd be satisfied, apologize and end up being happy. But nope, she's just sad.END OF SPOILERBut anyway I still enjoyed the unique movie and liked how it was. The son who didn't speak until the very end was touching and his private location up by the planetarium building was cool.So anyway, I rate this 7 because of the unique plot. It sort of loses a point from being 8 for the silly political stuff but in the end I'm sure (and hope) that everyone knows that it's a movie so it's not all true."
104,Horton Hears a Who!,7,24 December 2011,"A qualified ""Yes""","Being English, Dr Seuss is not required reading. We ran one or two of them past the kids when they were small, but the kids didn't really take to them and they were a bit of an acquired taste for us. So Horton Hears A Who was not a particularly familiar piece prior to the film.I find it very difficult to put myself in the viewpoint of a child for this one. Yes, it is colourful, there are some reasonably accessible gags and OK songs and, maybe, the strange - some might say demented - story about an elephant trying to protect a colony of microscopic people-y things could appeal to kids more than adults. I just don't know.But I suspect that this movie has something of Yellow Submarine about it - superficially bright and loud, but maybe more appealing to adults for how well crafted it is than it is to children for how effective it is as a piece of children's entertainment. It is exceedingly well crafted but, I think, there may be times when it misses the mark for kids."
105,Horton Hears a Who!,6,14 March 2011,Excellent Adaptation of the Book,"I have always been a fan of Dr. Seuss (which may explain why I've enjoyed so many films which can only be described as 'odd') and, while I was not sure how anyone could make an 86-minute film out of one of his books, I was curious as to how it turned out. Surprisingly, it was done quite well and Horton Hears a Who turned out to be an enjoyable journey.The Story: Horton Hears a Who is based on Dr. Seuss' classic book by the same title. The story is about an elephant named Horton who hears a cry for help coming from a small spec on a clover flower. Horton responds to the call and decides to help the small people who live on the flower. The other inhabitants of the jungle take offense at Horton, as they can't hear the people on the speck, and declare he is going mad and must be stopped. Still dedicated to helping his small new friends, Horton must get the clover to safety before it's too late.The Good: This film, like the book, contains biblical pro-life themes. Throughout the film Horton insists that ""a person's a person no matter how small"" and is dedicated to his mission of protecting the small people no matter what the cost. Down on the spec, the mayor must overcome the corruption in his town and convince the people of Whoville that while their town may have been stable for centuries, it's not stable anymore. The people then band together to help Horton save Whoville from imminent destruction. Also present in this film are sub-themes of friendship and dedication to a higher cause.On a more technical note, the film's animation is quite well done, but what really stands out here is the soundtrack. John Powell has once again composed a score that fits the movie like a glove but is also quite enjoyable in it's own right. While some of the characters seem a little overdone at times, they were cast well and the sound design complemented the picture excellently.The Bad: Toward the beginning of the film it becomes evident that the mayor of Whoville and his only son, Jo-Jo, do not have a healthy relationship. The father's and son's visions for Jo-Jo's future are at odds with each other and it plays out in a sullen silence on Jo-Jo's part. Fortunately, by the end of the film, father and son work together to save Whoville and I think it's safe to assume that their relationship goes uphill from there. Besides that, some slightly rude humor and a bit of name calling is all that can be considered negative in this film. As a warning, there are a few scenes that may be slightly scary for young children.Conclusion: Horton Hears a Who is a safe, clean option for an enjoyable family night. While there are a few problems with it, I believe that it can be enjoyed together by people of all ages. It's another one of those films that gives me some slight hope that Hollywood might not be completely dead.Let's hope they make many more."
106,Horton Hears a Who!,10,25 February 2011,Everybody matters,"This movie was such fun! I've watched parts of this movie, here and there, but I don't think I've ever watched it all of once. I'm glad I gave it a try, though, on this Saturday morning.This movie has two stories. One is about Horton, an elephant in a jungle, who has found the town of Whoville by accident and resolves to keep it safe and the other story is about the Mayor of Whoville, who is having a nervous breakdown by trying to protect his town.This movie is filled with much hilarity, that adults and kids BOTH are sure to get. The animation is excellent and really does this Dr. Seuss original book much, much justice. You're sure to laugh at Horton's funny antics and how everything is crazy down at Whoville.The main reason I liked this movie was, aside from the storyline, the graphics. The first part, where they showed the family of the Mayor during breakfast time, also really struck me. I found it cool, I guess. And kind of unbelievable. 96 daughters and 1 son! Gosh. As Horton said, ""Oh, busy guy!""This movie really gives a clear and strong message. ""A person's a person no matter how small."" Everyone's significant! Everyone makes a difference. You, me, the guy from accounting and everyone else! It also shows us that everyone's connected somehow. I teared up during the near-ending. This truly was a great movie. Top of my favorite animated films now. Who could have hated a wonderful film such as this one!"
107,Horton Hears a Who!,8,25 February 2011,Great adaptation of the book,"Dr Seuss's story is brought to the big screen with respect, truthfulness and heart. That's what makes the whole movie such a joy.Steve Carell and Jim Carry, who are well known for their over-the-top performances, are very restrained in their performances, very sweet in their roles, their voices really at the service of the story and their characters - Carel as the bullied Major of Who, and Carrey as the good-hearted elephant from the jungle of Nool. Carol Burnett is also great as the Kangaroo, matter-of-fact creature completely closed to anything that is not facts and rules.The animation is not as spectacular as other modern animated films, but some parts of it really shine. Especially great are the facial expression and body language of the characters, the attention to the detail in the creation of the family of the Major, the architecture of Who world, and the visual creation of some characters. My favorite were the creepy fluffy yellow Katie, and pathetic vulture. My favorite scene is perhaps the one with Horton is searching for his lost speckled world in a field of pink of thousands cloves, which I found truly magic.However, what makes of this movie what it is, is not the animation, but Dr Seuss's story, which is universal, timeless, simple and complex at the same time: A person is a person no matter how small. Stand for what you believe. Believe in what you don't hear or see. The world is more than yourself and more of what you see. What you do has a direct effect on other people. Reality is not always full of reason. So many life messages for the little ones embedded in such a fun story.Heart-warming and charming for both children and adults. Dr Seuss would feel proud."
108,Horton Hears a Who!,9,17 December 2010,top notch cartoon,"Horton Hears a Who! (2008)Horton Hears a Who is one of my favorite animated films, it's truly hilarious and a lot of fun.Steve Carell and Jim Carey lead in the film and both do fantastic. Jim Carrey is probably at one of his bests, he gives a Horton a personality that I don't think anyone else could come close to. All the supporting cat does great as well, Carol Burnett, Seth Rogen, Amy Poehler, Isla Fisher and so on. My personal favorite character is Vlad played by Will Arnett, doesn't have the biggest role but its important and all of his scenes are hilarious.The animation is great, its very cartoonish but very detailed. I haven't read the book so I'm not sure how it compares but I can't imagine it letting fans of the book down. It does seem to have an undertone of religion and other things like that but I don't think its meant to be preachy like some might say, just watch it for what it is, don't read into it.My only complaint about the film is when they all start singing at the end. It might be because I don't like the song but I think it was to pressured, like they were trying to hard to end it fun and light hearted so they had them sing. It in no way ruined the movie I just wish they had done it a little different.I suggest this film to anyone, both young and old. It didn't seem to be that popular but I think it should have been and I think most people who watch it will really enjoy it.9/10"
109,Horton Hears a Who!,7,6 December 2010,Horton Hears a Who!,"I forgot that The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T was his work, The Grinch was really good fun, and The Cat in the Hat was terrible, so I was looking forward to seeing this Dr. Seuss story brought to life. Basically in the jungle of Nool lives Horton the elephant (Jim Carrey), and when a speck of dust goes past him he is sure he can hear a voice coming from it, so he catches it in a clover. Even though he can't see anyone, he can definitely hear someone, and does everything he can to keep it safe, and of course he tries contacting whoever the voice is. On the speck is the microscopic city of Whoville where the Whos live, and the voice Horton is hearing is that of the Mayor (Steve Carell), who has a loving wife Sally O'Malley (Amy Poehler), ninety-six daughters, and one quiet son JoJo. Horton does get in touch with the Mayor, and he proves that the Whos are indeed living on a tiny speck, that is in danger of being destroyed by many jungle threats, so Horton promises he will find a safe place for it. Horton knows a mountain where no animals venture, and a very stable flower grows that the speck can rest on, but the journey to get there is full of perils. The journey is made more difficult by the fact that the nasty Kangaroo (Carol Burnett) who believes Horton is making his speck story up, and that his overactive imagination is bad for the children of Nool. She is determined to do everything to stop Horton, get rid of the clover and speck, and prove that nothing exists unless you can see, hear or feel it. The Mayor inside Whoville meanwhile is trying to prove to everyone that their world is inside a tiny speck, there is a giant elephant looking over them, and that they could be in danger. After a near loss of the clover and the Mayor having no luck, Horton encourages Whoville to make as much noise to prove they exist, while Kangaroo makes everyone tie him down. In the end, Whoville it proved an existing world on the speck by all the large animals hearing their voices, Kangaroo feels a fool but Horton forgives her, and the speck is taken to its rightful place. Also starring Dan Fogler as Councilman / Yummo Wickersham, Seth Rogen as Morton, My Name Is Earl's Jaime Pressly as Mrs. Quilligan, Will Arnett as Vlad, Isla Fisher as Dr. Mary Lou Larue, Jonah Hill as Tommy, Charles Osgood as Narrator, Jesse McCartney as Jojo, Selena Gomez as Helga and Joe Pasquale as The Dentist. Carrey gives a both a nice subtle and of course cheeky comedic approach to the lead character, Carell does well as the nervous character, the animation effects are colourful, and it is a simple story, a likable animated adventure. Very good!"
110,Horton Hears a Who!,8,11 September 2010,"""A person is a person, no matter how small.""","Bringing Dr. Seuss' hilarious story about an elephant, Horton, and his bizarre relationship with a speck to the big screen is inevitable. How well it succeeds financially at the box-office depends on the word of mouth (unless it boasts Pixar's stamp of quality). Voiced by two of America's top comedians, Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell, half the battle is won. The other half is won by the film's strong visuals; the colors used are radiant and striking while the detailed depiction (but not necessarily realistic) of the jungle setting and its colorful inhabitants prove to be engaging as well.Horton Hears A Who! paints two different worlds: The jungle in which Horton lives, and the tiny speck which Horton chances upon that happens to be a planet dominated by human-like creatures. Since Horton has humongous elephant ears, he is able to hear sounds that are inaudible to most. The mayor of Whoville hears Horton through a hollow pipe that's linked up to his rooftop. This is where the film becomes substantially interesting. In addition, its religious aspect is hard to ignore.Horton is like the God in the sky. And the people who make up Whoville become frighteningly familiar. There are some who are unaware that Horton exists while others ridicule the notion of a higher supreme being who's watching over them (much of which draws parallels with our world). Unselfishly, Horton goes to extreme lengths to protect the speck from his neighbors (most of them denying the existence of Whoville), even though he knows that his own life may be at stake. The sacrifices that Horton makes go mostly unappreciated until the end when everyone in Whoville believes in him and works hard together to achieve salvation.There is one thrilling yet funny sequence that involves Horton crossing an old, long, and swinging wooden bridge to bring the speck to safety. Just that scene alone encompasses Horton's vast compassionate range. Frankly, some sequences which are meant to tickle the funny bone are a bit too exaggerating when a simple job could have made it more effective. Horton Hears A Who! concludes with an unforgettable quote: ""A person is a person, no matter how small."" Well said, as life knows no boundaries, and everyone plays a part to make sure that life really knows no boundaries.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
111,Horton Hears a Who!,7,18 July 2010,Good Film. The Message Gets Somewhat Lost In All The Embelishments.,"as a big fan of Dr. Seuss i care how the recent ""big"" studio adaptations treat the original short stories. the main problem with 'Horton Hears A Who', and much the same problem with 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas', is that they tell very definite stories with a very direct and strongly stated message. unlike 'The Cat In The Hat' which tells no particular story and has basically no moral or message to it. that is why i felt the 'Cat' adaptation worked winningly(a minority opinion no doubt), and 'Horton' and 'Grinch' were more problematic.not only was 'Cat' based on a Seuss story with no strong story line or message, the 'Cat' film was pretty straight forward with very little embellishment or much added. i mean it was a very short film at 83 min. the problems with 'Horton' and 'Grinch' is that there is just too much distraction from the originals that the great messages (a person's a person, Christmas is a spiritual thing not material)get lost in a traffic jam of too many characters and happenings that never occurred in the books. most kids are not going to come away from 'Horton' remembering it's message of compassion about ""a person's a person no matter how small"", they probably think it's about a whole lot of other things because so much else takes place aside from it's message. same with 'Grinch', i doubt it's simple message was really heard in such a busy film with so much back story.the bottom line? 'Cat' had no real story in the first place so it survived ""big"" studio treatment better than these other stories which had strong story lines in the first place. the original hand animated features from the sixties convey the messages better and have a better feel for the material.don't get me wrong. i liked this movie. it was charming and a lot of fun. besides who could hate a animated movie with great actors like Jim Carrey and the incredible Carol Burnett?"
112,Horton Hears a Who!,10,28 June 2010,"Considering how bad the last few Dr. Seuss films have been, this one surprised me a lot.","We all know the last few Dr. Seuss films haven't been that good. The innocence of the books have been tainted in the live action versions of the books to where it wasn't even Dr. Seuss anymore. But now with an animated version of another famous Dr. Seuss book ""Horton Hears a Who!"" the innocence has been recaptured and mixed with great comedy and loving characters to create a fun and crazy film for everyone to enjoy.The film is about an elephant named Horton who hears a speck yelling for help. When he grabs it he learns that there's this whole other world on the speck a town called Who-ville. So now he has to find some place safe to put the speck so that the Who's world won't be destroyed from the instability of another world. However Horton has to face off against the self-proclaimed rule enforcer of the jungle Sour Kangaroo to do so. Her fear of Horton ruining her ""perfect society"" has her going to great lengths to destroy the speck and the Whos along with it. So now Horton has to find some way to show every one that no matter how small you are a person is still a person.Jim Carrey and Steve Carell make the perfect team in this great movie. These two masters of comedy work together to make everyone laugh and they do so without even trying. I immediately fell in love with these characters. Not just Jim Carrey and Steve Carell know how to make you love them. For instance there is one character who doesn't talk until the end of the film but you care for him because we've all been in the same position he's put in. The character is put into a position of what his father wants him to do with his life not what he wants and he doesn't want to disappoint him but he also doesn't want to live the rest of his life with regret. So there's the problem and many of us can relate to that since all of our parents have dreams of us being something like doctors or policemen, something they picture us doing but not something we picture ourselves doing.And also the story is worked out perfectly so there's no need to worry about it turning into another ""Cat in the Hat"". The film is true to the innocence of the book while adding in funny moments including some pop culture references to make the film more for this age of film-making. So the point is this film is great. It has great performances by Jim Carrey and Steve Carell, many funny moments to keep up the laughter, and a suspenseful climax to add on to the fun of the film. See ""Horton Hears a Who!"" it is great entertainment for the whole family."
113,Horton Hears a Who!,6,1 June 2010,"A little over the top, but pretty funny!","Hope this is not considered a spoiler, id rather call it an exciter! I have not read the story before and have no idea who Dr. Seuss( or whats his face ) is, but i saw this animated movie the horrible morning after a good long night in town. I woke up at a friends house on the couch and went straight to the fridge to grab a bowl of cereals. I then smacked my feet up on the table, put on the DVD that was in the machine and sat back wolfing down the cereals and milk. 2 min. into the movie there is a scene with some purple monkeys stuffing bananas into the mouth of a bigger monkey shouting ""MORE, MORE, MORE!"" until a banana pops out of the big monkeys nose, at which point i burst out laughing while trying to swallow some rice crisps which resulted in a room full of breakfast and a very p#ssed off friend! That scene and the spoof on bad Japanese cartoons make this movie worth at least a 6 / 10!"
114,Horton Hears a Who!,8,13 May 2010,True to the Seuss spirit and fun for everyone,"It will always remain a mystery as to what took so long for just a good old computer animation version of a Dr. Seuss story. ""The Grinch"" and ""The Cat in the Hat"" had their entertainment value, but the confines of the real world simply don't reflect the towering imagination of one Mr. Theodor Geisel. ""Horton Hears a Who!"" conveys that spirit of wacky yet message-driven entertainment.The iconic elephant, voiced by Jim Carrey and tailored to his talents as a comic actor, is playfully naive in this adaptation from ""Ice Age"" studio 20th Century Fox Animation. HIs sense of unbound imagination and inherent goofiness will resonate well with children as that rare combination of coming off both as friend and mentor. Surrounded by a Seuss- appropriate cast of the oddest creatures, his story of discovering an entire world of Whos upon a speck resting on a flower is the closest children's stories will ever get to the sense of cosmic existentialism and for that reason it's a powerful story to be able to be told at such a basic level.""Horton Hears a Who"" pits two ideologies -- one a clear winner from the get-go -- against each other: imagination versus common sense. Kangaroo (Carol Burnett) believes Horton telling the children of the jungle that there are tiny people in this speck is a poisonous idea and she'll stop at nothing to control the way her little one and the other children see the world. In the real world, the clear winner is Kangaroo, but rightfully so in a children's story, it's imagination that will take the day. Despite that inevitably conclusion, ""Horton"" is attention-grabbing with a bright sense of humor and ceaseless charisma.Few films blend genuinely clever humor with physical kid humor, but ""Horton"" does both with little extra effort. There are the nonsensical gags such as the little gerbil-like character who makes the most bizarre facial expressions and mentions that in her little world the people ""eat rainbows and poop butterflies."" The delivery is the adult-geared joke and the word ""poop"" catches the youngsters off-guard too. One sequence is a Horton spoof on anime which is simply hilarious if you have seen any anime before, but even if kids haven't, the fast-tempo of this bizarre sequence with Horton pretending he's a ninja will elicit laughs.Animation is not a focal point with this story. Fox has gone for a cartoony look that best exemplifies the bright bold colors of the Seuss books. A Seuss adaptation should without question have a look of its own and not conform to most animation studios nearly unflappable belief that more realism in animation is better. Fox picks and chooses where to be realistic (use of light, being one example).The central moral of ""a person's a person, no matter how small"" lies at the center of ""Horton,"" but doesn't squeeze its way in or dominate the story to the point where the ending is cheesy. Well, the whole cast singing ""Can't Fight this Feeling"" is a little cheesy, but it's also reflective of how joyfully random the film is.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
115,Horton Hears a Who!,10,8 November 2009,Horton is cool!,"I liked it very much. Horton and Mayor have done extremely well. They are very comical yet kind of sentimental. All others did their part too. Nice animation, dialogues, cool songs. I kind of felt great when the whos were trying to create a thunderous noise to prove the Horton's neighbors that they exist. Even jo-jo did a nice job. Kudos to the animators and directors. I've not really read the books, but I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. The Kangaroo's motivation and acting was so poisonous that I started hating her right from the outset. Atlast, one can say Horton has remained cool and achieved what he wanted to. I'd give a 10/10. Great one! :)"
116,Horton Hears a Who!,8,30 August 2009,A second look: HORTON HEARS A WHO.,"My Take: Despite a few missteps, faithful to the book. Great family fun ahead! I liked HORTON the first time I saw it (although I missed it on the big-screen), but through subsequent viewings, like many films I frequently catch, I grew to like it even more. Although many of the flaws I've encountered the first time are still intact, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Audiences who endlessly complained about Hollywood's big-screen versions of Suess' other works THE GRINCH and CAT IN THE HAT will most certainly found their remedy in this good-looking version, staying faithful to Suess storytelling (and obviously drawing) style. Me, not a big Suess fan (and I also loved THE GRINCH), liked it nonetheless. Besides, I really don't need to be a total fan of Ted Giselle's work. His work has an irresistible charm that's hard for any age group to resist (If you're in the right spirits of course!).Despite many complaints that Jim Carrey was too overbearing as the mean-one Mr. Grinch in the 2000 version, he's back as yet another Suess character Horton the elephant, the eccentric elephant from the Jungle of Nool who believes that there's a small town called Who-ville inside piece of speck in a clover. While the jungle's animals (especially Carol Burnett's truly Sour Kangaroo) are laying their doubts on him, Horton is determined to bring the Who-ville well out of harm's way, dodging the clumsy Vlad the vulture (Will Arnett lends his voice seamlessly) and rickety bridge, as promised to the town's panicky mayor (Steve Carell).Although Carrey's occasional familiarity gets a bit to distracting, he does get into character; the man truly shows his capabilities as an entertainer for all ages. The rest of the voice cast -- and this is a big one -- identify well with their characters; Carell makes good tandem with Carrey's Horton (their second film together since BRUCE ALMIGHTY) and familiar voices such as Seth Rogen, Dan Fogler, Jonah Hill and Amy Poehler (Yup! that's more Judd Apatow movie/SNL actors you will ever find in an animated movie) are all welcome additions. But perhaps the best thing to be given credit for is the animation. The guys back at ICE AGE's Blue Sky Studios did a great job being faithful to the source, and therefore achieving a perfectly faithful Dr. Suess adaptation that wouldn't disappoint the fans. Every landscape bursts with color and life, from the pastel paradise of the Jungle of Nool to the carnival-like streets of Who-ville. Why the movie couldn't be nominated for Best Animated Feature for simply looking gorgeous is beyond me. Since, despite its flaws (a corny anime-like sequence, an Emo Jojo), HORTON HEARS A WHO is splashy family movie fun.Rating: **** out of 5."
117,Horton Hears a Who!,7,25 August 2009,Good Time Pass,"Animated movies have always fascinated me and this one also does a good job at that.Animated flicks on jungles and animals have been made frequently, but his one is with a difference. This movie talks about the meeting of two worlds. One world is our world where an elephant named Horton dwells joyously with his small jungle friends. The other world is very tiny - so tiny that it resides on a little speck on a flower that Horton carries with him. This tiny speck is home to infinite creatures called as 'Whos'. Apparently, Horton with his strong and unmatchable ""elephant"" senses can hear these little creatures on the speck and his job now is to protect them and post them to a safe place.The storyline is good, the characters created are funny and the conversation between Horton and the mayor of the Who's is the highlight. The voices given by Jim Carrey (Horton) and Steve Carell (Mayor) are the best bet for their respective characters. I couldn't imagine anybody else than Carrey as Horton. Overall, a good Time-Pass Rating : 7/10"
118,Horton Hears a Who!,9,19 July 2009,A Review in Rhyme,"When I first read this book, I was just a tot. So, I decided to see the movie - And I liked it quite a lot!I'll try to keep this short, but I can't make promises here. The movie is too great, your children should not fear. I know this book; I can tell you the tale, and here is that story, in some minor detail:The mayor gathers everyone in town square But Horton can't tell them - he's really there. All of the Who's and Who-ville are unlike you and me, They are people whom we cannot see.Of course, no one believes Horton, which is sad, the Kangaroo is making sure that it will all go bad, they rally around the kangaroo, and they would say, They don't want Horton in the forest, at all, to stay.Horton's an elephant, living in what we call ""our world"". In the jungle of Nool there are animals, young and old. Who-Ville is on a flower, and in it are the Who. No one can hear them but Horton, but still, could you?A great story, of course, and as bad it is to say, such examples of Kangaroos can be found today. I love this quote, when Horton is about to fall, He shouts, ""A person's a person, no matter how small!"".You should go see this movie, I'm not afraid to tell, the acting is great, the animation is flawless, as well. I won't ruin the movie, but let me quote you this now, although it's not in the book, it sums up my review; how?""I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred percent!"""
119,Horton Hears a Who!,,4 June 2009,Let's be part of Horton's adventure,"Steve Carell and Jim Carrey reunite in this wonderful adaptation of Dr. Seuss's story. Carrey makes the adorable Horton memorably hilarious and Carell does a fantastic job in matching wits. One is almost always in for a treat when two excellent comedians work together. In addition to that, they are strongly supported by Carol Burnett, Will Arnett, Isla Fisher and co. The animation is pleasantly bright, colourful and lively. The characters too are vivacious and amusing. 'Horton Hears A Who' may have already become a favourite among kids (which is a good thing because there's a moral behind the story) but there are loads of stuff for adults too (like the double-entendre jokes). The story has heart, the dialogues are hilarious and the movie never deviates from the main plot. 'Horton Hears A Who' is pure rocking fun."
120,Horton Hears a Who!,8,17 May 2009,Finally done right!,"In the various attempts that have been made in making Dr. Seuss stories into movies, finally it seems that they did it right. Certainly, in ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"", Jim Carrey was a wise enough choice to play the Grinch; this time, his voice works superbly as Horton.But the genius of this movie is that it does a terrific job of evening out the playing field. In ""Horton"", Jim Carrey is equal with Steve Carell and Carol Burnett.One movie based on a Seuss book that was downright lousy was ""The Cat In The Hat"". Currently, is only rates 3.3 on IMDb. ""Horton"" is brilliant by comparison.""Horton"" is as fun as reading one of Dr. Seuss' books. Saying that makes me realize what a compliment that is to this movie.I really recommend this. It goes after that part of our childhood that still exists in our hearts."
121,Horton Hears a Who!,7,1 March 2009,Among the best of this years animations.,"As we are here  stuck in the tedious Dark Age of computer-generated films hoping for a miracle as all us eager moviegoers are being given measly, quickly forgotten bores to satisfy our hungry tastes for quality  one film shines above the rest...This wonderfully charming adaptation of Dr. Seuss' classic follows the entertainingly humorous and slightly touching adventures of the wacky elephant Horton (voiced by the talented Jim Carrey) that all begin from his observation of a strange, subtle screaming sound coming from a tiny floating speck.After catching it on a clover he bellows a greeting at the speck and meets the devoted but slightly eccentric mayor (voiced by Steve Carrel) of Whoville  an entire city that is living inside that miniscule space. When the mayor hears that his merry little town is microscopic and dangerously vulnerable he urgently asks Horton to carry Whoville to the very top of a faraway mountain where it will be safe from disaster. However  most unfortunately  the citizens of Whoville and the inhabitants of the Nool Jungle refuse to believe in the existence of another world and get in the way.It is elements such as the hatred built up of the narrow-minded, irritating, cruel-natured kangaroo (voiced by Carol Arnett) and the message that ""A person is a person, no matter how small."" that draw you in and convince you to keep watching to the end. Although, it might not be enough to entertain audiences a second time round."
122,Horton Hears a Who!,,26 February 2009,One of the most beautiful animated films I've ever seen!,"The first thing that catches your attention when watching this film is the animation. Not only the jungle of Nool but also the town called Whoville are both amazingly colourful and detailed. One of the many interesting aspects of the film is that some of the creatures of Nool are mainly based on real animals existing on our beloved planet earth, while others seem to be imaginary creatures, which results in a funny mix of weird creatures. You can also immediately tell that the animators put a lot of effort in every little detail of the expression on the faces of the creatures. Add to that some wonderful voices, especially that of Jim Carrey, and you have got yourself a bunch of really charming and funny characters. Although the narrative structure of the film is quite basic and does not really contain unexpected plot twists, it never gets boring. A huge variety of slapstick jokes probably contribute to that fact. The film also teaches the younger viewers a thing or two about the relationship between parents and their children (for example the relationship between the mayor of Whoville and his son who hardly says a word), believing in things you cannot see, hear or feel and believing in yourself whatever happens.'Horton Hears a Who!' really is one of the most beautiful animated films I've ever seen. The vivid colours, the totally absurd characters, the moral of the story: there are plenty of reasons to watch this film, but the amount of fantasy that has been put into this film is what truly makes it so appealing for both children and adults. Highly recommended!"
123,Horton Hears a Who!,9,21 February 2009,Exceptional imagination!!!!! Good story telling and cool animation,Horton takes you to a new world. The story has a kind of fantasy and imagination that bounds you throughout the movie. I took this movie from one of my friend just to watch it like any other movie. But after watching this movie believe me I watched it again and still it did not get boring. Horton is one of the best and cute character designed for this movie and the voice of Jim Carrey makes it alive. Each and every character in this movie has a special presence of its own and voices are awesome. I won't go into the plot of this movie because you just watch it and you will never forget this animated phenomena. Happy Viewing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
124,Horton Hears a Who!,10,31 January 2009,A Classic!!,"Anyone who is a fan of Dr. Seuss(Thomas Geisel) should see this movie. It's like reading the book just like it is, only more lively. Horton is an elephant in Nool who happens to be a teacher that's a bit of a bungler. However, he sense of loyalty remains intact. Also in that jungle is a kangaroo who is more sour than a bag of lemons, happens to be the most despicable person in that jungle. That one day which changes everything, does happens. Horton hears a voice coming from a little speck of dust. That dust happens to inhabit a small town called ""Whoville"". In that town, the Mayor hears a voice himself, sees the things that goes on in his town that causes major concern to it. Since only the mayor hears Horton, everyone else on both sides of the world thinks the other is crazy. In order to defend one another, Horton goes to the extreme to save the Whos from destruction. He had to ward off the evil Kangaroo, the apes she brainwashed, and the rest of the animals. Only her son put his faith in Horton. It's okay to be strange and different, but it's best to stand up to those who can't help themselves. Horton is the hero. Horton has heart. Horton has courage. The cast who put their voices in this movie did very well. I like it all the way. A perfect family movie. 5 stars!"
125,Horton Hears a Who!,7,24 January 2009,A New Takes on an Old Classic,"Whoville sits on a speck of dust on a clover in the middle of the jungle, where it is discovered by Horton the elephant. To protect the Whos, Horton decides to move the clover to a mountaintop. But a kangaroo, thinking Horton a liar, tries to stop him by any means.When I saw this, I had the 1970s version fresh in my mind. This may have been a good idea, and maybe not. There are significant changes. Most noticeably, the Wickersham Brothers get moved to a minor role, despite their prominent song in the original. Also, Dr. Huvee has been replaced by a mayor with 97 children.These changes were unfortunate, as I loved both Huvee and the Wickersham song. But the new parts -- the mayor and the vulture -- are good replacements and make this film not so much a remake as a whole new version, which is good... especially since the original didn't need any replacing.The inclusion of REO Speedwagon's ""Can't Fight This Feeling""? Not needed. Having the kid be an emo/goth outcast? Not needed. But, all in all, a great film for children, parents and others."
126,Horton Hears a Who!,9,6 January 2009,"Fun, wacky, and yet somehow still Seussian.","I did not have the pleasure of seeing this movie until the DVD release and now I'm sad I never got to see it on the big screen. Several other Seussian classics have been transformed into full-length features with various measures of quality--I think this is without a doubt the best. Perhaps it's because it's animated (and those Seuss cartoons just need to continue to be animated) perhaps it's because they did not make it weirdly perverse in desperation to appeal to adults. Perhaps they had just the right touch.The story of a steadfast elephant who communicates with a tiny being on a speck of dust is lengthened into an albeit much more developed plot with character development (and extra characters) without losing the message--indeed, they are careful to make sure it is not only recited in the movie but proved.It's a celebrity cast, but a good celebrity cast who lend their various personalities to their characters in a way that truly works. The animation isn't anything out-of-this-world, but I have no complaints against it whatsoever. It works and the movie is lovely.""Horton"" is hilarious, yet with plenty of heart and moral. I like to think Dr. Seuss would be proud."
127,Horton Hears a Who!,9,3 January 2009,A Great Example of How 3D animation can be just as great as 2D animation,"Horton Hears a Who is one of my favorite animated movies of 2008, if not my favorite. It's funny, charming, witty, and beautifully done. I am a big Jim Carrey fan and he does have some very funny one-liners as Horton, but he alone is not what makes this movie so good. Steve Carell does an excellent job as the mayor, who surprisingly ended up being my favorite character in the film. If I had to pick a favorite scene, it would probably be when Horton was crossing the bridge. The look of the film is amazing, with the bright, vivid colors and the unique Dr. Seuss style animation. It's unlike any other animated film I've seen. The score by John Powell is the icing on the cake, and there's also a hilarious musical number, which is the perfect way to end the film. Overall, this is my favorite Dr. Seuss adaptation, better than The Grinch (2000) and the infamous Cat in the Hat (2003). It's the perfect movie for the whole family, both kids and adults. It's also made by the same guys who made Ice Age, which is a big plus."
128,Horton Hears a Who!,9,29 December 2008,"Who should learn from an Elephant? Why, any human.","What a wonderful, completely beautiful family film 'Horton Hears a Who!' turned out to be. It's always nice to see something absolutely perfect for all ages, families, backgrounds and adults as well  without having to throw in crude jokes to keep parents awake. There was enough to keep all adults interested. I did grow up on Dr. Seuss, but actually never got around to this tale, so I have little (well, nothing) to compare it to. I just loved the visuals, the humor, the peace, the simple story for the tots, the humanity of Horton and the acceptance of others no matter the difference. (The final two examples are coming from an elephant and are sadly lacking in most humans, which is why this is a perfect film to show children.) Now, away from the praise and off the soapboxI did end up giving 4½/5 stars for two items that irked me throughout: the voices and the overused/buzz kill song and dance finish. I had to actually stop the film to see who voiced the Kangaroo and was shocked when I learned it was one of the best comedians of all time  Carol Burnett. I could barely tell it was her, she absolutely showed no range. Most of the other voices were flat, and Jim Carrey seemed to want to break out into his usual Ace/Mask/Riddler spasms, but when mellow he was tolerable. Then again, the target younger audience probably won't care. And another killer (not in a good way) song and dance ending? I hated it in 'Shrek 2,' and loathed it in 'The Polar Express.' It just has no place; it never fits the rest of the film. However, these two minor glitches aren't enough to stop a recommendation to all."
129,Horton Hears a Who!,7,9 December 2008,It was totally Fun and Comedy,"The movie was totally fun and comedy. Amongst the animals, Horton was very funny and cute. The town which is named ""Whoville"" is very beautiful. When, Horton is crossing the bridge, that time he is very funny. Even, the Mayor of Whoville is also funny. The last scene was totally thrilling and awesome. The machines made by JoJo are very cool. When, Horton is chasing the eagle, that time Horton is very funny and that scene is totally awesome. When, the Mayor is showing their family photos to JoJo, that time the mayor is very funny. When, the town in the speck changes into ice that time the town looks very beautiful. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Horton Hears a Who!""."
130,Horton Hears a Who!,9,7 December 2008,"Overall, not bad!","I grew up reading Dr. Seuss books and I loved all of his stories, especially this one. After the real live Grinch movie, I was excited for the real live Cat in the Hat and was utterly disappointed. However, when I heard they were making this into a movie I got excited, realizing they were going to animate it.The voices are fabulous, the animation looks just like what Dr. Seuss drew, and the story is adorable. It's great for kids (there's not crude humor like in the Grinch or the Cat in the Hat) and I, as an adult, thoroughly enjoyed it. It's worth your time if you are a true Dr. Seuss fan and you should check it out whenever you have a chance."
131,Horton Hears a Who!,8,3 December 2008,Probably the best of the full-length Dr. Seuss adaptations so far,"This version of ""Horton Hears a Who!"" is the third full-length adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book, and the first CGI animated one, as the previous two are live action. The 2000 adaptation of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" turned out to be polarizing, receiving praise as well as hate (though I liked it), and the 2003 adaptation of ""The Cat in the Hat"" turned out to be generally despised, which it deserves. However, this adaptation of ""Horton Hears a Who"" is a little different, and is definitely the most popular of the three. After seeing it, I can understand why, since I found it to be superior to both of its predecessors, and since it's the first one to come after the 2003 version of ""The Cat in the Hat"", it deserves credit for being SO much better than that film! Horton is an elephant who lives in the Jungle of Nool, and is a teacher to the child inhabitants of this jungle. One day, he sees a speck of dust floating by, and hears a mysterious voice coming from it! After a struggle, he manages to catch the speck, and then begins to carry it on a clover which he holds with his trunk. There happens to be an entire community on this dust speck called Whoville, and the mayor of this town is Ned McDodd, who has 96 daughters and one son named JoJo! Being the firstborn, JoJo is to be the next mayor of Whoville, but does not wish to be. Horton and Ned begin to communicate through a device, and Horton must get the speck to a safe place in order to save Whoville! However, the arrogant Kangaroo does not believe what Horton says about the dust speck, and as the elephant tries to get it safely to Mount Nool, the Kangaroo plans to somehow stop him, with most of the others in the Jungle of Nool on her side! Meanwhile, it won't be easy for Ned to convince his fellow Whos that there's a much larger world out there, and that Whoville is in danger of being completely destroyed! As with ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and ""The Cat in the Hat"", they obviously had to extend the story in order to make it a full-length feature. For example, they go deeper into the life of the Mayor of Whoville and his son. Still, I would say it's still faithful enough to the original story, probably more so than both of the previous full-length Seuss adaptations, especially the second one! Even though it's been years since I last read the book (or had it read to me in my childhood) and last saw the animated TV short, much of this movie still rang bells. They made sure they included the unforgettable line from the book, ""A person is a person, no matter how small,"" which is the moral of the story. There's also some wacky humour, for those who like that, such as Horton's anime fantasy, and Horton trying to get across an unstable bridge with the speck during Ned's dental appointment. I definitely got a good laugh out of these gags. The film sometimes gets rather suspenseful, and sometimes touching as well, as it should be. The animation is also excellent and colourful, and Horton and Mayor Ned McDodd (a very different mayor from the nasty Augustus Maywho from the full-length ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"") are both very likable characters.Would Dr. Seuss himself approve of this adaptation of his story? Well, some seem to think so and some don't, but he would definitely be more likely to be proud of this one than the previous two full-length Seuss adaptations. In addition to being more faithful to the original children's story, this adaptation of ""Horton Hears a Who"" is definitely the cleanest of the three films, without the crude humour in the other two (especially in the ""Cat in the Hat"" adaptation). Since it's Dr. Seuss, I would say this is how it should be. Since the legendary children's author's death in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, has annoyed many of his fans by doing things like publishing ""Daisy-Head Mayzie"", a story Seuss wrote and decided not to publish (which many believe was a wise decision on his part), and letting the live action movies be made (especially the ""Cat in the Hat"" one), but after that disgraceful film starring Mike Myers, this adaptation of ""Horton Hears a Who"" shows that not all is lost."
132,Horton Hears a Who!,8,1 October 2008,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Horton Hears a Who! (2008),"The quality was so good you would think it is a Pixar movie. It is very hard to find a animated movie that is this good that isn't a Pixar movie. I am sure that Dr.Suess would be proud to call this his movie not like the disappointing Cat in the Hat and the only just good Grinch.The animation was beautiful. My eyes were thrown into a world of color and detail. Another beautiful part of the movie was the story. It wasn't complicated and overdone. It was just simple and heartwarming. Of course with every heartwarming story there's a message and its a great one, ""A person is a person no matter how small"".It was no Pixar movie but it was very close. It was funny and can be enjoyed by both a kid and adult. I am hoping to see more of Horton in the future.8/10"
133,Horton Hears a Who!,6,6 September 2008,There is nothing here I can say that hasn't been said. It was fun.,"I think this has to be one of the single best animated movies I've seen in a long time. It's a rare day when something like this engages me just as much as much as the bloody, ultra-violent movies that I love and makes me think even more.I'm not even sure the core plot even matters as much as the fact that the pacing is perfect. Dr. Seuss understood the mechanics of how to thrill people more than most bloody action movie directors ever could. He didn't use this genius in dark, serious work, unfortunately, but his children's works still put me on the edge of my seat, nevertheless.Horton Hears a Who! is certainly not the best Seuss story, but this is easily the best Seuss adaption yet. When the live-action version of The Cat in the Hat came out a while ago I felt like someone should have punished the director for destroying such an amazing story. I'm not sure that I can call Horton Hears a Who! better, or even up to par, with the original source material, but it tries, for a change. And it doesn't fail.The movie was quite hilarious, and had me laughing out loud more than once. It was so much funnier than just another sex comedy with overused jokes that I've heard since I was born.I also loved the deep thoughts the movie presented, which can be interpreted a lot of different ways. Some people interpret it to be the underdog moral, others interpret it to be pro-life, and others interpret it to be so many things. I love how the movie does the anti-cliché and doesn't try interpret itself.Overall, just go rent this movie. If you don't love it, regardless of your age, I'd be really surprised.5/10"
134,Horton Hears a Who!,10,29 July 2008,A Story of Validation,"The story is so simple in its premise yet so complex in its consequences. It is about the validation of one's existence through the acceptance of others. And in all levels of the story, this premise applies. Imagine believing in something and sticking to it, and each and everyone else believes otherwise. And imagine being ridiculed for it. Yet, you have that unwavering certainty about what you believe despite what everyone else says. Who is right? You? Or everyone else who think, know, and assume they are right just because they say so?Horton is a kind, gentle, and sweet elephant. He is very unassuming and unpretentious. He is as truthful as can be. He is honest, straightforward. He knows what he believes despite not being able to demonstrate this. Yet, his entire person is committed to that belief even if no one else shares it. He speaks out this commitment with innocent bravery: ""I meant what I said, and I said what I meant; and an elephant is faithful one-hundred percent"" (makes you wish people were elephants, who also, by the way have really good memories). And he believes in the existence in the Mayor of Who-ville. These two persons, big and small, believe in each other and it is this shared belief in each other that was, to its barest the key for each others survival. For Horton, it rested on the existence of the other the acceptance of his own community. For the Mayor, it was that as well and then his literal survival and the survival of his world as he knows it. The Mayor put it quite literally when he said, ""you are the one holding the speck."" Yet this ingredient to survival worked both ways. If the Mayor did not ""hold"" Horton in his hands, by which I mean to stand by him also, he could not have strived to pull the town together thus passively resigning to the demise of their world while everyone was in contented ignorance. Eventually, this faith in each other pulled them through in the direst of time. And this mutual faith validated either end. The story is indeed very personal, so personal that, in the end, it radiated onto everyone in Horton's community, and in the Mayor's.In the end, we realize that all a person needs to feel accepted is the chance to be heard. The littlest attention to anyone can make a whole world of difference. For as Horton would say, ""a person is a person, no matter how small."""
135,Horton Hears a Who!,8,7 July 2008,A Dr. Seuss adaptation that gets it right.,"Hollywood and Dr. Seuss certainly aren't a match made in heaven. Two minds that are clearly on different wavelengths, it shouldn't come as a surprise that there will be more hits and misses as Hollywood continues to dip into Seuss' collection for cinematic inspiration. But with the arrival of the imaginatively rich 'Horton Hears a Who!', the right chord has been struck to create a lasting and charming film in the spirit of the original book.Downright adorable, 'Horton' is a warm-hearted movie for children and adults alike. It doesn't need to pad itself full of unnecessary pop culture references (unless you include random anime sequences) or sour potty humor (unless you count pooping butterflies). A majority of the inspiration comes from the mind of Dr. Seuss himself, and that makes this experience that much richer and genuine. There's little here that will leave us wanting more or with a sour taste left over. 'Horton Hears a Who!' is as cute as cute can be.The film's animation is spectacularly whimsical, appropriately Suessical and allowing the worlds dreamed up by Suess to be given their true justice and beauty. But it is perhaps the endlessly star-studded voice cast that is most impressive here. Jim Carrey, who is at times barely recognizable in the title role of Horton, is perfectly spot-on. And Steve Carell, the goofy Mayor of Whoville, is just right. And with the likes of Carol Burnett, Will Arnett, Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, Isla Fisher, Amy Poehler, and Jaime Pressly, the entire cast blends seamlessly with the characters for the best possible results.For a non-Pixar film, 'Horton Hears a Who!' carries with it an exceptionally strong message. For all the kids, it tells them they can achieve anything regardless of how small they may be. For adults, 'Horton' gears more towards subtle politics. But what could have become a heavy-handed and preachy misfire becomes a very sweet and uplifting experience with a great sense of humor to spare. This is the way Dr. Seuss should be brought to life on the big screen, because it works. Short and sweet, it's an innocent and entertaining fable to be enjoyed by all.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
136,Horton Hears a Who!,3,28 June 2008,Horton should not hear a Who,"Sorry, but to me, this was a big disappointment. Not on Jim Carrey or Steve Carrell's part, but in the script in general. It didn't get my attention like The Grinch did or even some of Cat In The Hat. The anime scene was enjoyable, but something about it just made me think this was just a reason to make more money.Everyone knows Dr. Seuss' tale of Horton Hears A Who, but somehow it didn't seem like Dr. Seuss' tale at all. The characters looked like the pages of the book, but a very dull and boring version. I really think i'm the only one I know who didn't like it, and honestly I don't know why. I prefer Kung Fu Panda a thousand times more."
137,Horton Hears a Who!,7,8 June 2008,Horton hears a 'Yes!' from me,"Yes, I liked this film. Even though it isn't as good as some of the Disney films and Shrek 2, it succeeds in bringing a smile to my face. I especially loved the climax. It was mind blowing, full of entertainment and excitement. Towards the finale, you wish to rise from your seat and yell in excitement ""Come on!"".But I can't say that its better than any of the Disney films. I found the beginning to be a bit dull. The story became more intriguing as it progressed. That raised the bar.Horton is very lovable and has been voiced by the right actor. The mayor and the description of his family was hilarious. The animation was good. Many of the scenes boosted the adrenalin. It was the story that made the film great. If it wasn't for the great story and the innovative idea, I don't think that it would've succeeded as much as it has done.I give it a thumbs up. 7 out of 10."
138,Horton Hears a Who!,8,27 May 2008,Pretty Good,"I thought this film would be kinda kiddish but maybe a few jokes here and there but not great, but I was wrong. This movie is pretty good it's funny and there was even a few jokes in there that the smaller children probably wouldn't have gotten which were funny. I think this is a great film for people who like a good cute children's movie. Steve Carell and Jim Carrey are funny as usual just like in most of there other movies. I think that the ending was good on how JoJo saved the town when he like didn't care about anything in the movie and then suddenly saved the town. I wouldn't say this film is awesome and hilarious but it is good and funny in some parts, good family film."
139,Horton Hears a Who!,8,14 May 2008,Better than I expected...,"I took my 2 year old to see this - his very first cinema experience. I had my doubts about him being interested, let alone me! However, both of us loved it. I thought it would be lame - but was very pleasantly surprised at how many times I laughed. The voice acting is just awesomely done by all... and visually they have done a fantastic job of bringing the Dr Suess characters to life.I think my main reason for being skeptical was because I totally disliked the previous movies based on Dr Suess books - The Grinch who Stole Christmas & The Cat in the Hat. This movie is no comparison.Definitely recommended for the entire family, not just for the kids!"
140,Horton Hears a Who!,7,6 May 2008,Horton hears a Winner,"The new animated film from first time directors Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino comes the film adaptation of the Dr. Seuss book by the same name. With the voice talents of Steve Carell & Jim Carrey, this is quite an enjoyable time at the movies for any child or adult. The film tells the story of Horton (Carrey), an elephant who finds a small world on a dust mite and decides to protect it from harms way but when he shares his new secret with his animals of the jungle, he encounters many obstacles. This small world is called Whoville where the Mayor (Carell) lives with his many children and wife. As genuine as the film is, it does read as a PBS special with top actors on board. Carrey is a witty and hilarious as ever, breathing new life into Horton. Steve Carell proving he is one of the best working comic actors today is superb in his role as the sympathetic Mayor, trying to introduce change to Whoville.As beautifully written as it is heartwarming to watch, Horton Hears a Who! shows itself as a definite contender in this year's Animated Film race. ***/****"
141,Horton Hears a Who!,9,28 April 2008,I really like this movie,"Following from ""Grandam Got Run over by a Reindeer Horton Hear a Who is a remake of a short that orinigally came from WB Studios. The movie is about Horton discovering a talking dust city by nobody believe him but Hope did not let him down.Horton mostly takes advantage and sometimes out-wit Jane Kangaroo like pretending he didn't care what others think. The Mayor usually gets his own back on Horton which makes the show pretty fun to watch. The characters in the movie are great even though I'am too old for Dr. Suss I do enjoy the remake because I do think it's very entertaining. Trust me this is worth watching."
