0,The Boxtrolls,10,26 September 2014,More allegorical meaning than you can fit in a box,"The film Boxtrolls is so jam packed with themes that cut to the core of our society that you might expect it to be cobbled together, choppy, overreaching, and pretentious. It is, in fact, none of those things.A thoroughly entertaining, not too cerebral, romp down one box conveyor after another, the film succeeds at wrapping it's central theme of persecution and prejudice in layers of equally significant ideas: group self-identification, class ambition, dalliant obsessions, self-esteem, and self-destructive addiction. It follows a nicely predictable plot arc that will satisfy your children while you ponder whether the plucky heroine's ostensible obsession with the macabre is likely a reflection of a Freudian complex with roots in her father's indifference. The bad guy with his crooked teeth and greazy hair is unmistakably evil. But at the same time the good guys aren't wearing the white hats. In fact, it's comparing and poking fun at both incompetence and maliciousness.The animation finds it's grounding in a setting that is reminiscent of Corpse Bride. From the industrial green palate of the box trolls to the stiff and starched characterization of the patrician class, the visual design of the film holds together well.After the film you'll walk out of the theater with lots of things on your mind, but you won't be walking out with a child who was bored to sleep or fits by another didactic feature of animated hogwash. That is an impressive achievement for any film."
1,The Boxtrolls,8,7 September 2014,"A fun film, Roald Dahl like darkness.","We took our 3 year old son to this film, and was not expecting much entertainment for us adults. However, both my wife and I really enjoyed it and my son has been walking around in a bottomless box with holes cut in it,(for his head and arms),for two days.It has a lot of charm and a slight edge of darkness. I am surprised that it has received such poor reviews from the critics. I have noticed they tend to rate realistic, depressing films; whereas we like happy escapist fun and this film delivers that. We are from the UK and the voices are perhaps better known here, which may have contributed, a little, to our perception of this film's charm."
2,The Boxtrolls,9,27 September 2014,Heartfelt Nature,"The ""animation"" genre now has a common trait: it is known for broader gags, bullet speed pacing, and eye candy visuals, but out of many animation studios out there, Laika Entertainment could be the only one that stays loyal to their own direction. Aside of the stop- motion animation and love to the horror movie camp, their storytelling and themes are equally unconventional, though charmingly daring at best. The Boxtrolls is no different from their last two movies, except this one might be gentler, but the strangeness is still there intact. And by those merit, the experience becomes special.It might get immediately be assumed that the film has the same moral of 2012's ParaNorman. It does have that feeling: strange people being treated as outcasts by everybody and describes their fear to them out of caricatures. But the film tends to explore more messages beneath besides of that, if you can get behind with the whole rescue plan stuff, you may also get to notice that it's really about separating people's common views and expectations from the reality; like the Boxtrolls they're against with aren't actually bad creatures, or some fathers turn out to be not as supportive as they're supposed to be, or even the difference between being good and bad. The sentiment may sound a little familiar, but the delivery here is often steady and bitter to acknowledge its sincerity, and it indeed makes it remarkable.As for the animation, there's no hiding for the love of the horror movie aesthetics. The world already looks magnificently whimsical as the filmmakers transcend their stop-motion animating abilities by making grander and crazier set pieces and physical comedy, but when it comes to featuring its creature and character designs, the camp just brings lots of it to life, some parent might find it a little creepy for smaller children, but if they don't even bother then there is no denying how beautiful they're designed anyway. In another angle, it offers a larger extent of warmth compared to many family movies today. The nearly wordless montage of the Boxtroll Fish raising young Eggs is one of the sweetest things you would see in recent memory, while the sadder montage at the middle act could surprisingly be affecting. These storytellers just know how to drive emotions. Among the voice actors, Ben Kingsley predictably becomes the best. He brings the main pizazz as both the villain and his hilarious drag disguise. Isaac Hempstead Wright and Elle Fanning are great as well, giving their characters the personalities they need. There are more big names (mentioning the favorites like Simon Pegg and Richard Ayoade) that bring the extra fun of the film.The Boxtrolls is probably going to be the least attraction for the animation genre this year, mostly because it's nearly apart from the comfort zone of today's entertainment. If you don't care about trends, then this movie is a treat, and as usual from its studio, the overall film is dark, campy, but visually stunning and eventually endearing. They still haven't changed and I hope it always stays that way, especially the monster movie tribute and strong heart and perspective towards things. The Boxtrolls proves that these types of animated films shouldn't be antique yet, there is a huge value to its quality and moviegoers should once again encounter it."
3,The Boxtrolls,8,25 September 2014,Maybe a classic,"For the potential viewers of this film, don't worry if you didn't read the book Here Be Monsters! first. The Boxtrolls movie stands on its own as an excellent story wrapped in visuals that pay homage to the craft of stop motion animation. It's funny, clever, gross, a bit cheeky, and a bit dark. Everything kids and many adults who accompany them or with others in the age group will enjoy. Whether it will be a classic or not, is hard to say.The Boxtrolls are, well, basically trolls that have boxes they use as clothes and safety. They are a modest and timid sort. They are also industrious and like all kinds of gadgets. Since the story takes place around the time of the Industrial Revolution, there is no shortage of gears, crankshafts, bolts, wheels, or any manner of metal part they try to put to some other use. They also are good at babysitting. None more so than Fish and Shoe, the two de facto fathers of one young boy that goes by the name of Eggs (it should be noted that their names are the names of the boxes they wear).Without getting into too much detail about the origins of their young charge, these three along with the other Boxtrolls have been labeled as kidnapping, baby eating, monsters by the fine townfolk of Cheesebridge. Led by the elite White Hats and their leader Lord Portly-Rind (Jared Harris) and the upwardly mobile Red Hat Archie Snatcher (Ben Kingsley), they have vowed to eradicate their hamlet of the Boxtroll vermin. The only thing more important than accomplishing this task is their love of all types of cheese. Some of the funniest and strangest scenes of the film is the discussions and consumption of cheese by the ruling class and the aforementioned Mr. Snatcher.Besides a wonderful voice acting performance by Sir Kingsley, The Boxtrolls is full of great turns. Two of Mr. Snatch's henchmen Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout, (Richard Ayoade and Nick Frost, respectively) offer up metaphysical and philosophical commentary musings about life and their career choices. On the other hand, the overzealous Mr. Gristle (Tracy Morgan) is a man of few words, rather letting his actions do the talking. Elle Fanning (Maleficent) and Isaac Hempstead Wright (Game Of Thrones) are a perfect match as Winnie, the daughter of Lord Portly-Rind and Eggs. She teaches him how to act in public, while he indulges her thirst for all things creepy and crawly.The look of The Boxtrolls can be summed up in one word: amazing. Not in a super saturated color, larger than life way, but in a painstakingly meticulous, attention to detail way. Although the film is in 3d and might lose something when viewed on a smaller screen, the skill, reverence and affection the animation/modeling team poured into the sets and characters, along with top shelf screen writing and acting make this film one of the best animated features to come out in quite a while.See more at: www.mediumraretv.org"
4,The Boxtrolls,8,16 September 2014,"Dark and visually perfect, with some lighthearted fun. Brilliant.","This mix of stop-motion and CGI brings a fun, charming tale that appeals to all ages.Set in the town of Cheesebridge (it's motto - a gouda place to live), the 'minion'-like creatures called boxtrolls have for years terrorised the habitants and are hunted by childcatcher-esque exterminator 'Archibald Snatcher', voiced by Sir Ben Kingsley, who has been promised a place in the town council if he's destroys every last one. The story is enjoyable, heartwarming and is really brought alive by the stop motion animation and topped by a plethora of famous British voices.The themes are a little darker than explored in a lot of younger-aimed films, and there is a sense of adventure and danger that you don't see in the majority of animations. But this doesn't mean that it isn't entertaining. Those who are fond of the Despicable Me's minions, will love the Boxtrolls' actions and personalities, resulting in many lighthearted moments too.For those that have seen creator Laika's other works - Coraline and Paranorman - you will enjoy this very much. They don't have as much of a fan base as the biggest stop motion Aardman - the visionaries behind Wallace & Gromit, but their quirkier, darker animations can appeal to a larger range of audiences. Here, with their third film, they have made really enjoyable film, entertaining from beginning to end. Be sure to stay at the end for a little credit sting showing how it was made."
5,The Boxtrolls,8,1 October 2014,Thinking Outside the Box,"This film is recommended.The Boxtrolls, a well-crafted stop motion animation film combined with the latest CGI advances, is an entertaining but somewhat safer and slightly sanitized film from Laika, the same studio that delivered Coraline and ParaNorman, two earlier children's film with a twisted Gothic edge. A pleasant antidote to the cheery Disney fare regularly served to the young set, the film is diverting fun. There are still twists and turns in the film but it's less of a giddy roller coaster ride than expected. Based on Alan Snow's novel, Here Be Monsters, the darker tone of the book has been substantially altered and lightened up for a more crowd-pleasing effect, although there are some grotesque moments that may frighten the little ones.Moviegoers are immediately transported to the dingy squalor of brick factories and small shoppes that line the cobblestone streets of Dicken's Ole Victorian London town, or, in this case, renamed Cheesebridge. The upper and lower class live here, both in fear of the Boxtrolls, a lower lower subspecies that dwell underground who are part monster, part cardboard. Living amidst them is Eggs, an abandoned child who was lovingly raised by these creatures that roam the night to recycle the discarded refuse left by people. They avoid human contact as much as possible. Who can blame them! There is the haughty and aristocratic Lord and Lady Portley-Rind, their inquisitive and precocious daughter, Winnie, and especially Archibald Snatcher, a scheming and hateful villain whose main goal is to do away with all Boxtrolls! As with most animated films nowadays, the visual elements are far superior to the narrative story. The Boxtrolls are not the exception. While the script has some clever dialog, an involving tale, and its charming characters, the plot becomes too formula-driven and conventional. The screenplay by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava relies too heavily on slapstick and chase sequences rather than developing any deep characterizations. The Boxtrolls themselves lack any real distinctive personalities and that British droll humor is in short supply. Everything seems a tad too predictable and ordinary, except for the artistry of the filmmakers and their wonderful details with the elaborate settings, steam-punk gadgetry, and off-beat characters. Special kudos to the remarkable production design by Paul Lasaine. The voice-over work by the actors (Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Tracy Morgan) is highly accomplished and adds even more joy to the film, especially with Sir Ben Kingley's marvelous line delivery as the nasty baddie who completely steals the film. (In fact, Archibald is more interesting than our hero, Eggs, at least, as viewed in this film adaptation. Kingsley has created one of the best animated villains in years, although part of his great performance pays direct homage to Dame Edna.)Directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi painstakingly create a unique world of grime and clutter. They also allow the surreal elements to emerge to maximum effect, particularly in the underground sequences. Though the film lacks some cohesiveness in its story-telling, The Boxtrolls, more often than not, does think outside the box. With all its creative energy and technical inventiveness on display, even Roald Dahl would be proud.

6,The Boxtrolls,,25 September 2014,Not cute but clever,"There are cute children's films - like ""Frozen, the first movie to which I ever took my granddaughter (then just under three) - and then there is the more challenging kind - like ""The Boxtrolls"" to which I took her nine months later. We haven't read the source material, the novel ""Here Be Monsters!"" by Alan Snow, but she knows all about trolls from ""Frozen"" and other stories and these are very cleverly represented through stop- motion capture by the specialist production company Laika. But it's a little bit scary for young ones, so my granddaughter held on to my hand most of the film and sat on my lap for the final third.For British adults of a certain age, the characters of the town of Cheesebridge look like people from a Gerald Scarfe cartoon and the subterranean habitat of the boxtrolls themselves is like a cross between the worlds of Heath Robinson and Hieronymus Bosch. The voices are very well-done and for me the best of comes from Ben Kingsley as a hard bad guy and Richard Ayoade as a soft bad guy. Stay for the credits when early on there is a little bit of existential angst on display from two of the stop motion characters."
7,The Boxtrolls,7,11 September 2014,"Grotesque and yet charming at the same time, this visually singular piece of stop-motion animation is quite the spellbinder","If you haven't yet seen 'Coraline' or 'ParaNorman', it may take you a while to get used to the world of 'The Boxtrolls'. The third feature from Oregon-based studio Laika Animation, it is told using the same stop-motion technique (with some CG and hand-drawn work) as their earlier films, but the similarity doesn't quite stop there. Yes, once again, the animators have eschewed the cuteness of Disney or Dreamworks for something much darker than your normal kiddie fare at the Cineplex, and therein, we would argue, is the reason why it proves so uniquely charming.Adapted from British children's author Alan Snow's fantasy adventure 'Here Be Monsters!', it retains the Steampunk setting of the novel but takes quite a few creative liberties. Instead of an over- industrialised Ratbridge, the city in question is Cheesebridge, so termed because the dairy product is what separates the rich in ""White Hats"" from the poor in red ones. What unites the humans across their class distinctions is the subterranean Boxtrolls, little blue- skinned fluorescent-eyed creatures who emerge from the sewers at night to swipe anything and everything they can get their hands on.So named on account of the cupboard boxes they wear their bodies, the Boxtrolls are feared by the humans as much they fear the humans. The fear of the former is stoked by none other than Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley), a truly detestable rascal who is responsible for spreading nasty rumours about the Boxtrolls in order to justify his eradication for a coveted place with the ""White Hats"" and a seat with them at the cheese tasting table. As you can probably guess, their leader is no saint either, but rather a self- absorbed aristocrat by the name of Lord Portley-Rind who cares more about his Gouda and Brie than the welfare of his citizenry.It's a lot of setup, but co-directors Anthony Stacchi and Graham Annable deftly lay out the intricacies of their make-believe world while setting the narrative in motion. For reasons only revealed in a crucial flashback sequence later, a boy is taken as a toddler under the care of the Boxtrolls and is named Eggs after the carton he wears over himself. While on the prowl one night, Eggs runs into Lord Portley's precocious daughter Winnifred (Elle Fanning) who is shocked that a human would be associating himself with the dreaded Boxtrolls; but before she can make his acquaintance, Eggs is forced to flee from Archibald and his henchmen.As such stories go, Eggs sets off on a quest with Winnifred in tow to convince the humans that the Boxtrolls aren't sinister beings who kidnap children. To top it off, Archibald turns out to have a nefarious scheme after all, building a contraption to assert his authority over Lord Portley and demanding that he be given the latter's white hat. But parents need not worry - writers Irena Brignull and Adam Pava don't deny the kids of a happy ending, though not before subjecting them to some grotesque images that may just make them swear off cheese for some time.Consider this as fair warning - visually, this isn't cast in the same mould as the usual CG animation, and one might even go as far as to say that 'The Boxtrolls' operates in a realm of ugliness. But once you look past the cruder-than-usual designs, you're likely to find the cardboard-wearing critters surprisingly endearing by their guile and naivety. We urge you too to pay attention to the dazzling production design that makes up the world of Cheesebridge and the underground lair in which the boxtrolls call home; there is a whole cornucopia of details that will leave you wowed if you pay attention to them.Still, compared to their earlier features, this latest lacks the heart and poignancy that made its predecessors memorable. Eggs never comes across as someone whose plight we would sympathise with, nor for that matter is Winnifred a likable enough character. The way the boxtrolls communicate in an Ewok-like language is amusing all right, but they are lacking individually in any defining personality. Because we never quite understand the reason why the humans so fear the boxtrolls, their eventual reconciliation doesn't quite resonate as it should.It isn't that 'The Boxtrolls' is underwhelming though; against a surfeit of clean-cut CG animation, its stop-motion aesthetics make it a refreshing change of look. Rather, because its earlier two adventures were such singular accomplishments, Laika's latest seems more like a walk in the park. Yet its refusal to be boxed in (pun intended) by conventional animation features is still evident in its design as well as its choice of themes, and if there ever were need to prove that it is possible to be both grotesque and charming at the same time, then 'The Boxtrolls' would be it."
8,The Boxtrolls,8,1 September 2014,"""Ugly Minions"" - UK Film Review","Based on Alan Snow's children novel ""Here Be Monsters"", The Boxtrolls follows in the eerie and murky footsteps of Coraline and Paranorman for an animated caper with more quirkiness than a Come Dine With Me at Tim Burton's house.Isaac Hempstead Wight voices ""Eggs"", a boy who grew up under the streets by a group of box-wearing trolls, who roam the streets at night finding anything they can to make into useful devices. Deemed a menace and a scourge, the city employs The Red Hats, a team of brutal Boxtroll-catching goons led by Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) - a ruthless and ambitious tyrant, who hopes to climb the social hierarchy in order to swap his red hat for a white one.White Hats are the political strata of society, the decision-makers, who spend more time scoffing cheese in the Tasting Room than providing any worthwhile contribution to the town of Cheesebridge. When a White Hat's daughter, Winnie (Elle Fanning), falls in with The Boxtrolls and Eggs, the town becomes the setting for a rough-and-tumble adventure as the gang attempt to find and free the Boxtrolls who have been taken by the Red Hats.Fun, funky, and full of creative freedom, The Boxtrolls delivers a meatier and more enjoyable family film than its predecessors, with a spectacular cast of voices, and some of the best animation in years. It is lively, perfectly-timed, and some of the weightier themes will keep even the snobbiest of film-watchers interested. The film delivers commentary on very relevant class issues and green themes, whilst keeping them tucked under a bombastic and explosive film for families.The Boxtrolls themselves are like ugly Minions, speaking an incomprehensible dialect of baffling gibberish, whilst looking petrified by the harsh realities of human interaction. They are, in fact, more appealing than Minions as they each have subtle differences (like the one with false teeth, or the one with anger issues), and varying boxes - such as Fish or Eggs.Just as The Boxtrolls roam the streets recycling garbage into new and useful things, the film itself has recycled some of its makers' past imagery (wouldn't quite call it garbage, although Paranorman tested this particular reviewer) and created a late summer film that thinks outside the box."
9,The Boxtrolls,2,4 October 2014,I loved Coraline but this made me uncomfortable...,"Coraline is one of my favorite movies. It had a sort of dark comedy to it but this is definitely NOT in that category to me. This was just dark, bordering on sadistic.I took my 7 year old son and thought this would be a good movie but instead several times I found myself questioning whether this was something he needed to be watching.The evil characters in this movie are a bit too evil - one especially makes you feel like he could star in the cartoon version of Hostel. The cruelty to the trolls and the children was uncomfortable to watch. I think I laughed maybe once. Most times I was wincing or feeling like I was on the verge of tears. Things that were off putting to me: They show the evil villain swinging to kill the boys dad with a large wrench, a troll and later the boy are put in a cage, boy's dad chained upside down for a ""decade"" who keeps repeating ""jelly"" because his brain is not right, chasing a child with a bat and swinging to hit them several times, making jokes about killing the boy because he won't be still then aiming and firing the gun, trolls hit and kicked in their boxes, trolls put in a box crusher machine, and holding a child chained over a fire (even if the outcome didn't happen) was just too intense.I don't want to even get started on the cheese eating episodes. That part could have played out funny but he was made to be so grotesque. Then when he stretches out his tongue across the screen to eat the cheese twice its just disgusting. Throwing leaches on his face to get the blood swelling out was just beyond strange. Plus the ""hostel"" guy was so thrilled to be get the leeches to throw on him in secret.So not to be all negative I did like the animation. The box trolls are adorable."
10,The Boxtrolls,4,24 November 2014,"not really what i expected, sadly.","everything kind of felt slapstick. it wasn't really trying to be a film that'll make your eyes flood with tears. all was slapstick. just slapstick. but, not at the first act of the film where the box trolls steal a baby and have a box put on him and the animation was very good by the first act.the animation is what steals the show the most. This film would be Oscar worthy about it's animation as it's first two films were, (in which they were better than this movie).I wanted to enjoy this film, but I think only slapstick and stuff that didn't make sense. could entertain your little rascals but probably not you very much."
11,The Boxtrolls,10,24 January 2015,A very fun and entertaining film!,"I laughed at some of the reviews I read on this movie about the people who hated it. Everyone's a critic. However, take it from me this movie is a great film. Ben Kingsley did a phenomenal job playing Archibald Snatcher. In some of his lines he drags out the words in a way that just adds to the value of this movie; They really could not have picked a better person to play Mr. Snatcher. It has some humorous points to it and I didn't see any scenes that would be bad for children like some others have claimed to see. This is probably the best animated film for 2014. I just can't help but watch it over and over. For some reason I thought the same director or writer wrote this and Wallace and Grommit:curse of the were-rabbit. Probably because both movies really like to put cheese in the film. However this is not the case and both movies have separate directors and writers but the cheese scenes were good enough that I wanted cheese after the film."
12,The Boxtrolls,,6 December 2014,"""I was promised rivers of blood!""","Grotesque and mostly boring animated movie in the Corpse Bride mold. There's not a lot of fun to be had here and it's definitely not for kids. It's weird, ugly, and depressingly bleak. One of many disturbing scenes has a fat drag queen singing an awful song about the title creatures. It's truly terrible but I couldn't turn away. It was one of the few times in the movie I wasn't bored to death. Underneath the surface-level blandness of the story, there's a lot of allegorical class warfare stuff. Very cutting edge and risky....for 1894. But hey, a home run in softball is still a home run, right? If you're looking for something to show your kids, I wouldn't recommend this at all. As for adults, I'm sure there's a market for it. Lots of people like 'weird for weirdness sake' stuff. Personally I found it very unappealing beyond some decent animation and a few bizarre moments that were worth watching once."
13,The Boxtrolls,4,7 October 2014,"Dark, Grotesque and lacking anything memorable aside from its title characters","We enter on a city filled with cheese-loving aristocrats and the easily-frenzied proletariat, both of whom are gripped in terror by a fiendish subterranean race simply known as the boxtrolls. They come out at night to steal your things and cause general mischief. These foul creatures know no decency and have gone so far as to steal and supposedly devour an innocent child! Or at least that's what the town exterminator voiced by Ben Kingsley wants you to think. In fact the boxtrolls (simply trolls that wear boxes like clothing) are actually highly intelligent and timid creatures that want nothing more than to take your garbage and create fun and elaborate devices underground.Being a peaceful race, they in fact did not eat the child, but rather raised him as one of their own for whatever reason. The child is named Eggs - because of the picture on his box  and is voiced by Isaac Hempstead Wright, whom most of you will recognize as Bran from Game of Thrones. Jared Harris lends his voice as the cheese sniffing aristocrat Lord Portley-Rind. His daughter Winnie (Elle Fanning) discovers the boy-turned-boxtroll and subsequently (and annoyingly) has to investigate. Tracy Morgan voices an mentally deficient henchman with a lust for violence. And finally Nick Frost and Richard Ayoade complete the henchmen trio as Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles respectively. Frost and Ayoade are actually the only characters I thoroughly enjoyed as they just offer self-questioning philosophical and metaphysical commentary about the nature of good vs evil the whole movie. So to summarize: A boy is raised by a race of peaceful subterranean trolls that steal garbage to build inventions. Meanwhile the town's exterminator wants to transcend his social barrier and ascend to the coveted rank of wearing a bourgeoisie white hat as opposed to his proletariat red hat. To accomplish this he rally's the townsfolk through hate-mongering and sensationalism so as to universally hate the boxtrolls and call for their systematic extermination. The idea being that if he's the one to exterminate them all, then he'll be viewed as a hero and he will graciously be offered anything he wants, including a white hat. Pretty intense huh? There's also uncomfortable sexual themes, parental detachment, implied murder, and unnecessarily brutal acts of violence. This film actually really bothered me for a number of reasons. Naturally the animations are a masterful product of Laika Studios and take stop-motion pictures to a new level, but the graphics themselves are certainly an acquired taste. Everything and everyone in this film is just grotesque looking as if its meant to be endearing. Speaking of endearing, the story does not lend itself to any sympathy towards any of the characters. The Boxtrolls themselves are never developed beyond gibberish speaking, indistinguishable creatures. Eggs isn't the least bit interesting and Winnie is just annoying and bothersome. Honestly the most interesting character is the Exterminator and if I'm not mistaken he actually has more screen time than the boxtrolls. I actually got in an argument with a fellow theater patron when she overheard me say 'Was that supposed to be a comedy?' after the film. She proceeded to praise the stinky cheese puns and toilet humor in this film as being 'A shining star for the genre' and that the Pixar films paled in comparison. Even the worst Pixar film is leagues ahead of the Boxtrolls, MADAM, both in terms of creating endearing characters and a creating a narrative that offers a family friendly atmosphere while at the same time exploring more adult themes. This film lacks humor, lacks substance, and overall just left me feeling somewhat at a loss at how anyone could call this a family film. I'll admit the boxtrolls were whimsical and kind of cute, but the entire film just felt like an Adam Sandler take on Despicable Me.Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website"
14,The Boxtrolls,7,16 January 2015,The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Boxtrolls Only infants and the homeless can find value in discarded cardboard boxes.However, according to this animated movie trolls also appreciate consumer packaging.Cheesebridge is being terrorized by a subterranean species dubbed The Boxtrolls by the terrified residents on account they wear old boxes for clothes.Rumoured to consume babies, the Lord of Cheesebridge (Jared Harris) employs a psychotic exterminator (Ben Kingsley) and his crew (Nick Frost, Richard Ayoade, Tracy Morgan) to eradicate the Boxtrolls.Unbeknownst to everyone in the town, except the Lord's daughter (Elle Fanning), a human boy (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) is living amongst the Boxtrolls and fighting to save them from extinction.Dark, disgusting and slightly demented, this mature stop-motion adaptation of the children's book Here Be Monsters doesn't shy away from the gross, morbid things that kids revel in. While its' eye-catching animation is a visual delight.Mind you, hungry trolls can be the solution to homelessness.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
15,The Boxtrolls,3,26 September 2014,Dark and disturbing,We took our grandchildren to this film recently.In my opinion it is one of the most disturbing children's feature we have experienced.It was hard to distinguish who the goodies and who the baddies were - the characters were all quite grotesque.The scenes where a character experienced angio doema after eating food was particularly difficult to watch. This is a serious condition when experienced - requiring immediate and drastic medication to be administered. It isn't a joke and untreated could prove deadly.I could not even see any humour in it at all.
16,The Boxtrolls,4,19 October 2014,Not that great...,"I was hoping for more, but this movie just wasn't anything worth talking about. I was bored and so was my 5-year-old son. The animation was good (especially since it was claymation) and the storyline had a good message, but it was so long and drawn out. I can tell you that this movie will fade from my 5-year-old's mind in a flash. He won't ever remember a bit of what it was about (except for about Box Trolls, obviously) and I will be unable to forget wasting moments of my life that I will never get back while sitting in the movie theater watching this movie.I was definitely hoping to find these little trolls to be cute and like-able. They were like-able, but also forgettable. The whole thing about the white hat and all the cheese eating was weird. It really was lost on a young child. My son asked me why everyone cared about eating cheese and about those ""silly hats"" and all I could say was, ""I guess they really like cheese and hats."" If you must see this movie, wait for it to come out on Netflix or rent it somewhere. Don't waste your money to see this in the theaters."
17,The Boxtrolls,7,22 September 2014,"Laika, excellent as always.","The Boxtrolls is the third outing for stop motion studio Laika, and it retains the amazing craftsmanship seen in their previous films. The animation used in the Boxtrolls technically exceeds any other stop motion film I have seen before, with some extremely captivating shots throughout. The world they have created is extremely grimy and intricate, and like every other aspect of the film, is full of little details that keep your eyes locked to the screen. All of the characters that inhabit this world are equally interesting, each individually quirky and charismatic. The story itself, while fairly simple, is effective, often aided by snappy, humorous dialogue. To top the movie off is clever message strung throughout the film.The Boxtrolls is a must see for its visual excellence, great dialogue and touching message; what other kids movies have lines like ""rivers of blood"" and ""piles of baby bones"".4/5"
18,The Boxtrolls,5,9 February 2016,Could have been much better.,This film has some brilliantly detailed animation. All the scenes and characters are unique and not generic by any form. The box trolls especially are so ridiculous looking but at the same time absolutely adorable. They have this Gollum vibe yet thankfully they don't seem sociopathic.It's quite a morbid movie really and not at all what I was expecting. The human characters are ruthless and their behaviours are disgraceful. They're actually quite idiotic which makes the movie hard to enjoy.In the end I got out of it what I was wanting but the whole thing didn't capture my imagination. All in all it was an okay movie.
19,The Boxtrolls,,10 December 2014,nice lesson,"about difference. in Laika studio spirit,dark, amusing out of ordinaries rules, it could be a surprise because the same spirit becomes a delicate - precise lesson about tolerance and friendship, appearances and justice. the Victorian atmosphere, the strange characters, the references from Pied Pieper to Shoah, the inspired music and lovely animation , the stop motion as perfect tool for recreate the spirit of discoveries and a kind of not ordinary joy are the virtues of a film for kids but who could be useful return to the age of question and new manner to see the life in a sort of parable about the true essence of the other and yourself."
20,The Boxtrolls,1,26 September 2014,Horrible Movie for Children,"Took my 5 year old and 3 year old to see this movie tonight.. We left 1/2 way through.. it was absolutely horrible. I thought it would be a little dark along the lines of something like Nightmare Before Christmas.. It was NOT.. It was morbid and grotesque and out right cruel and abusive.. from the way they treated the trolls to the evil humans.. to the leaches being put on people.. I truly cannot understand how anyone could call this a kids movie.. I wouldn't even want my 12 year old to see it.. I wish I could say it was an alright movie just not for kids, but I cant. As an adult that movie was completely uninteresting and just a big waste of time.. If I could have rated it negative I would have."
21,The Boxtrolls,1,27 September 2014,Awful...,"Who comes up with these movies? This was horrible and no words can describe how much a wanted to dig through the seats and walls just to get away from this garbage. Even my 6 year old said it was awful. I would rather watch cheese age then watch this. The animation looked like something from the stone age, the 3d was really bad and all of the characters looked old and ""roughly"" drawn. The whole concept was horrible and a plot so thin it didn't exist. I am sorry but you have been warned. It was as if someone just threw all of this together is hopes of making some money. I wish i had waited and someone had warned me before i wasted my time and money on this."
22,The Boxtrolls,1,13 March 2015,Truly the worst kids movie i have ever watched,Completely and utterly terrible. Considering the whole point to the villains scheme is just to eat frikkin cheese? Like seriously you couldn't think of anything better? I will admit I did like the boxtroll characters. But this movie was absolutely boring. Even my 6 year old little brother was asking to leave once it started. I seriously do not recommend this movie unless you have so much money you don't know what to do with it anymore. The White hat dad was a terrible representation of what a father is. kids were treated like they don't matter. But seriously the frikkin movie was a disaster. The villain wanted to eat cheese so bad (even though he was lactose intolerant) that he dressed in drag and had guys drooling all over him. I usually like movies but this crap I don't even consider a movie. I strongly do not recommend watching this movie.
23,The Boxtrolls,1,7 March 2015,Awful Story,"The animation was superb, the story was unattractive. We rented the film and had to fast- forward through most of the movie because it was slow and had no point. I would not recommend this movie to anyone , anytime, anywhere.The story has undesirable characters. There was not one character that was memorable or worth cheering for. I cannot even come up with 10 lines to meet the minimum to describe how awful the movie was. It was that bad. The story falls short in all areas and can't believe the academy gave this movie a nomination for best animated feature. While the artistic craft of animation, lighting and sound were quite good the story was so bad I couldn't appreciate everything else. The fact that this movie went to production is quite surprising."
24,The Boxtrolls,10,28 January 2015,A Magnificent Work of Art.,"Once again, Laika does it again. First ""Coraline"" in 2009 and ""Paranorman"" in 2012. Now ""The Boxtrolls"" in 2014. This is based on the Alan Snow book, ""Here There Be Monsters."" To start off, it is very well executed in terms of animation and craftsmanship. Just look at how detailed those miniatures and models are created. They are very well detailed. Another thing that is great about it, is not only the music, but the voices too. Ben Kingsly and Simon Pegg are great, but the big round of applause should go to Dee Bradley Baker. Ever since I heard his voice-work in the ""Powerpuff Girls"" episode, ""Super Zeroes"", I thought he did weird voices, but when I heard his performance of the monster in that episode, I my liking grew ridiculously strong and I began liking his performance in ""American Dad"" and ""Codename: Kids Next Door"". I would like to point out that it is very well written and I found some humorous scenes that range from rude and crude to Pythonesque (i.e. similar to Monty Python). Speaking of which there are many scenes with a lot of crude humor, but there are also scary scenes. For the sake of warning, I am going to give you some examples. OK just one, Archibald Snatcher, the villain, I mean just look how creepy and grisly he looks. Especially when he lures up to the camera or the camera lures up to him. I bet children and adults were reacting with laughter and screaming in terror when they saw those scenes in 3D. Especially when they were grossed out. Hence the PG rating. Would this be the future of family films? Some scenes are not suitable for sensitive viewers, especially if they are children under the age of seven. I mean fifteen to twenty years from now people would talk about the time they saw this when they were kids and say how some scenes scary. I love it, so I highly recommend it. Especially as a film to watch on Halloween. Rated PG for peril and some scary scenes. If you didn't know, this has been another ""Matthew Praises."""
25,The Boxtrolls,10,7 October 2014,Another Delightful Stop Motion Film from Laika,"Splendid! The Boxtrolls is another fantastic stop motion film by Laika. In the city of Cheesebridge's a human boy named Eggs ( Isaac Hempstead- Wright) is raised by Boxtrolls, creatures that rummage the streets at night and live under the city. Mr. Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) intends to exterminate every last Boxtroll, all for the love of cheese and a white hat. Eggs needs to teach his family to stop hiding. Stop motion dates back to Wallace and Gromit, Gumby and many of our favorite Christmas specials. Laika has created movies I adore such as Coraline. This film is another success with its fast pace stop-motion. The way the boxes fold, stack and bend are impressive to watch. The designs of the characters are distinct and detailed. From the trolls who are dirty with glowing eyes and pale blue skin, to the proper humans who are clean with fancy clothes and perfect hair.The small scale sets are marvelous. The film transports you into two opposite worlds. Once is the view from above the city where we see buildings and streets of stones. At night it's dark with only lamp posts to light the way. The Boxtrolls' under ground lair is a whole other picture. The ground is covered in boxes and tin cans for the characters to slide around on. The room is lit with light bulbs they find and is filled with inventions that they have made.The writing is witty. The comedy comes through in a very playful manner with its shock humor and, at times, straight-forward jokes. There is even a scene with a rim shot. The trolls, even though they speak gibberish, bring a lot of emotion into their delivery. Speaking of which, the voice talents are sensational. The villain Archibald Snatcher, who is my favorite, uses his amazing voice talents to create this mean, eccentric character. He fits the image that we see on screen. Same goes for the rest of the cast, particularly Elle Fanning who plays Winnie, a snobbish brat that befriends Eggs. My favorite scene is in the middle of the credits. When the credits roll, please stay in your seat! What you will see is one of the funniest fourth wall jokes to be seen on-screen. The moral of this story is you can change your nature. The Boxtrolls are used to sneaking around and hiding. Even when they are in danger, they don't fight back. They learn that they can change.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 7 through 18- year-olds. This movie gives the audience jokes, engaging characters and beautiful visuals which make it a great film. Reviewed by Keefer C. B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic"
26,The Boxtrolls,3,29 January 2015,"Nice craft, poor storytelling, design and too dark for younger children","Contains Spoilers - This movie came onto my radar when I stumbled across a infomercial promoting this movie. The infomercial was so poorly done that it caught my attention. When it was released, I noticed that it was being marketed as a children's movie (and I think it may have been released on a school break week). But this movie _sucked_. OK, stop-animation is a lost art form. Great. This movie took a lot of effort to make. I get it. That said, it still was a horrible movie. The Plot As a rule, movies about anything that involve baddies that 'eat-children' are generally not appreciated by children. The plot is too dark, centering around 'box-trolls' that eat children (but they don't and they're good) and the villain who wants to kill the trolls. As the movie progresses we witness implied killings,burnings,crushings, etc. but at the end we get the ""actually everyone you thought was dead went to Aruba and got a free puppy"" trope. There were so many things ""wrong"" with movie as evidenced by the following. One plot-thread is how the villain wants to be in power/respected so that he can 'eat cheese' - even though he is horribly lactose intolerant. So we are treated to several allergic reactions where his face swells into grotesque shapes. Of course, since this is a children's movie, the treatment is to throw a bucket of leeches on his face to suck the swelling down.From using the mecha from ""Wild-Wild-West"" to the love-interest whose facial expression seems to be stuck in a look of mild-disgust, this movie fails on so many levels."
27,The Boxtrolls,3,23 June 2015,A troll by any other form is not a troll,"Fantastic animation. Fantastic animation and fantastic animation.The movie though falls flat. The trolls are far less scary than the humans. Perhaps part of the, 'preachy', 'theme' the production team was looking for. From a kids perspective it's hard to tell if they'll have sleepless nights or enjoy the quirky, over the top characters and all their gross out detail. From an adults a little childish and annoying as the characters don't fit into the standard category of kiddies/adult flicks; inside out comes to mind - the perfect mix of made for children and adult fodder.If your little one scares easily. Avoid. If they can sit through a period piece and get over the humans they'll be just fine. If you're the baby sitter you might want to take along something to read to keep you entertained during the long periods of dull script and story line and look up at the screen during the sprinkle of odd ball gross out humor combined with some cringe worthy boy/girl lines."
28,The Boxtrolls,2,17 October 2014,Box it up and store in the attic.,"Here's a weird movie that deserves to be missed. It uses Claymation animation to tell the story of the falsely accused junk collecting trolls clothed in boxes. The animated characters will scare small children and leave adults wondering how much longer will this.go on. A grotesque character becomes more grotesque with an allergic reaction more then one time.Animated movies need charm, beauty and likable characters. This nightmare causer lacks all of those qualities.The best part of the movie will be missed by most as it is over the end credits as an animator does his work.Skip this in theaters. Stay home and watch ""Frozen"" again."
29,The Boxtrolls,9,26 November 2014,An artistic triumph.,"I did not expect to love ""The Boxtrolls"" as much as I did, but I sure did. This is because the film is wholly unique and a gorgeous piece of art from start to finish. While I also enjoyed the weird plot, the look and style is what really caught my fancy.The film is set in some sort of alternate universe. In this one, boxtrolls are literally cute little trolls who live inside boxes! Despite being shy and harmless creatures, the humans have the idea that they are a danger and have arranged for an evil guy, Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) to capture them and get rid of them once and for all. However, a baby that was raised by the boxtrolls named Egg might just be the one to stop this senseless slaughter and prevent Snatcher from realizing his ultimate goal...This is a film you simply have to see to believe. Like other films by the same production company (""Coraline"" and ""Paranorman""), this one was made using stop-motion--which is very time consuming. But it's not just the quality of the stop-motion that is great but the wonderful art and design of the characters and town. Plus, the characters are unusual and avoid the usual clichés and is well worth your time."
30,The Boxtrolls,7,20 October 2014,How can a movie about blue monsters wearing cardboard boxes be good?,"From the same brilliant studio who brought you Coraline and ParaNorman and all their stop motion glory, here's The Boxtrolls, which is based on a British novel by Alan Snow. And as far as storytelling in stop motion goes, this film holds up really well. It's strange, dark and goofy as something you'd expect from like a Tim Burton movie.Here's the story. In 1803, London, everyone's living in fear because in the dead of night, mischievous creatures come out at night, known as the Boxtrolls. People think they're vicious little monsters who kill children, but in reality, they're actually shy creatures who search for junk to build their own inventions with them. It also turns out that they're raising a child, who they name Eggs. A pest exterminator, played by Ben Kingsley, vows to destroy all the Boxtrolls and as each night goes by, more and more Boxtrolls disappear, much to Eggs' dismay. One day, Eggs decides to surface on the streets of London and try to find his lost friends.The story is very good and the narrative is pretty flowing. The stop motion is VERY good. Have the time I couldn't catch the pauses in between it's that good. The characters are very likable too. Eggs is a very likable character. He's curious, quirky and very delightful about the human world that he tries to interact in. A young girl, played by Elle Fanning is also likable. She can be a bit sassy, but has a good heart and has a fair amount of depth to her. The villain is also a lot of fun. There's just so much energy in him and he can be pretty diabolical, but at the same time, he provides a lot of laughs. One thing I really love about this flick is the first ten minutes. It has little dialog, but the animation tells most of the story while the rest is left up to the characters' expressions like Wall-E did in its first act. There's also several creepy looking imagery, which does balance the edge and lightness in it. One thing I really love about this movie is that I had NO idea where this movie was going to take me. There was one moment I thought it was going to be clichéd, but it didn't. Then I thought it was going to be another, but then it did something else. I really liked how it was unpredictable.Is there anything I don't like? Wellprobably the pacing. The pacing is just a little too fast for me to begin with. But after a while, it calms down and goes normally, so honestly, that's kind of a nitpick.So, overall, I think this is a wonderfully made movie with lots of visuals, good humor, good story, good characters. See it if you haven't already. You won't regret it."
31,The Boxtrolls,10,14 October 2014,This is BETTER than Coraline!,"The message it passes is so cool, smart, real and current. I mean, it shows how some people will choose to spend money on a huge cheese than on a children's hospital. And some will work hard stepping on other people just to get things that are not even good for them, but they desire it anyway. Some will believe blindly in lies just because a number of people talk about it. But there's also the bright side, like people realizing their mistakes and choosing to redeem themselves, people who will really listen to you and and think for themselves, with no prejudice. I for one could and can identify all those kinds of people throughout my life. I really liked The Boxtrolls, and my eight- year-old nephew too. Keep an open mind and go watch it. :)"
32,The Boxtrolls,4,6 October 2014,Dull as dirt and as subtle as a train wreck,"One must understand the difference between film made with an artistic vision and films made by uninspired dullards who like to think they have artistic vision.The Boxtrolls is one of the latter. It paints the portrait of a production team far too enamored by their ""artistic"" vision (which, by the way, is butt-freakin-ugly by design) to be troubled with telling an actual story. The end result is something that feels like it was slapped together at the eleventh hour, as it somehow manages to simultaneously be a boring chore of a story to sit through AND 100% anvilicious with its Holocaust references (not quite as bad as Foodfight! in that regard, but the fact that a comparison even came to mind should be cause for alarm enough).In a nutshell, Laika Studios is going the way of M. Night Shyamalan, with Coraline being their Sixth Sense and The Boxtrolls being their Lady In The Water; a movie with all of the hallmarks of their work, but little to none of its appeal (anyone with high hopes for the Wildwood movie should give them up right now)."
33,The Boxtrolls,3,31 January 2015,Disappointing from an adults point of view. 3/10,"Review: I found it quite hard to get into this movie. The story was weak and the animation looked a bit weird. The whole Boxtroll concept was a but weird and I honestly can't see kids enjoying it. The storyline is about an evil man who wants to capture all of the Boxtrolls so he can earn the right to get a white hat. After a baby gets kidnapped, he turns the whole town against the Boxtrolls which makes them think that there evil. Simple but not that great! The characters weren't that great and I lost interest in the whole plot after a while. I was impressed with the attention to detail but the characters looked pretty scary, with there strange stick legs, massive bellies and odd looking teeth. I wasn't a big fan of Caroline, which has the same type of animation, so I wasn't surprised with the outcome of this film. Disappointing!Round-Up: It really does amaze me how much these animation movies cost. I know that there is a lot of technical work behind them, but as a viewer, I really can't see were the $60 million budget went in this movie. Anyway, the director got some top names to add there voices to this movie, but I couldn't tell who was who. Ben Kingsley was Snatcher but I couldn't work out who Tracy Morgan, Toni Collette or Simon Pegg was. With that aside, I couldn't really relate to the characters and I didn't really find the movie that interesting.Budget: $60million Worldwide Gross: $108.2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation movies about an evil man who wants to capture all of the Boxtrolls so he can earn the right to become king. 3/10"
34,The Boxtrolls,10,27 September 2014,Best movie of the year!,"Okay, I may be a little biased since Claymation (stop/go) animation is my all time favorite style, and however much I would enjoy a Claymation film with less character than this one, this one was truly well done! I especially loved the high detail of the costumes, background and even the teeth and gums of some of the characters! Grotesque, someone below said...? Yes, at times it certainly was! Cruel...? Not anymore than most children figure out soon enough. The people who wrote a review stating that the movie was cruel did not see the movie through to the end. Do I think this movie is appropriate for very young children? Definitely, yes. Those of us who grew up reading and watching Roald Dahl's work didn't get messed up seeing some of the cruelties of life, and Mr. Dahl didn't shy away from showing it! Roald Dahl was my favorite author when I was a child, and though he is not the author of this story, it goes along the same lines as his stories; none of which were laced with sugar. They simply showed life as it could be, and how it was similarly unfortunate for some. I think kids will love the adorableness of the protagonist characters in The Boxtrolls, and understand the antagonists for what they are...the bad guys. Maybe they'll be like I was as a kid and appreciate the different facets of life being shown to them in an honest, yet somewhat humorous and cute way? Absolutely a Brilliant film. 100 stars for this one!"
35,The Boxtrolls,3,23 November 2014,Not for the grownups and NOT for the kids so who?,"The story's okay but the animation has that French/European kinda look to it that feels kinda outdated. Definitely not cute characters. I have kids from 2 to 15, 6 of them, girls and boys, and not one was interested in this movie. the animation almost reminded me of Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, the one with Burl Ives as the snowman. And there is really nothing for an adult so I don't know who would enjoy this. Trust me wait for a rental if you must see it.Added to make the line quota:This is a really dark kinda movie not a lot of humor or cute jokes but I'm sure someone in film school (or in the family) will think (or say they think) it's ""fabulous"" but seriously no matter what you hear it isn't"
36,The Boxtrolls,,12 March 2015,"Problem, officer?","This visually impressive stop-motion animated movie plays like a twist on H.G. Wells' classic The Time Machine: its underground-dwelling Morlocks - here a diminutive race called Boxtrolls - are harmless critters with a penchant for steampunk, unjustly feared and discriminated by their smug Eloi - here the class-obsessed citizens of Cheesebridge. A boy adopted by the creatures, with the help of a surface girl, fights against ruthless town exterminator Snatcher, who plans to destroy the Boxtrolls.The vocal talent assembled here is impressive; as much as I like Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Elle Fanning and Isaac Hempstead-Wright (Game of Thrones' Bran), the standout is an unrecognizable Ben Kingsley in a magnificently loathsome, scene-stealing turn as Snatcher.Much like the authors' previous work Coraline, this isn't for small children. It's not as creepy as their brilliant Gaiman adaptation, but it features a certain amount of grotesque moments - like a character's face horribly swollen after an allergic reaction - not really suited to toddlers.7/10"
37,The Boxtrolls,9,24 February 2015,An excellent blend of silly and sophisticated,"Delightful, funny, wildly inventive and politically astute, ""The Boxtrolls"" is like what you might have gotten if Monty Python had made a kid's stop-motion animated fable that was tremendously adult friendly. (Indeed, Eric Idle penned a very funny song for the film). It's full of good puns, bad puns, witty lines, and trenchant but not overbearing social satire about class, rich people, greed, stigmatizing of anyone 'different' and ugly mob mentality. It was made with wonderfully original, painterly, sometimes beautiful and always playful visuals, that give it a unique look and feel. The story is simple, a gang of Boxtrolls, odd little creatures that live in abandoned boxes the way hermit crabs take on abandoned shells, is terrorizing the small English town of Cheesebridge, where  for some odd reason - many are obsessed with cheese. The town reacts to these ugly ducklings as dangerous, but really they're more resourceful and sweet then most of the town's inhabitants, who would gladly exterminate these 'pests' without a moment's thought. The Boxtrolls are blamed for kidnapping and eating a young human boy, but really they've raised the child as one of their own, and now, as an adolescent, 'Eggs' tries to bridge the gap between the worlds. The voice acting is all excellent, with Ben Kingsley earning special note as a terrific villain, his voice unrecognizable. Critical reaction to this was somewhat mixed, but it all worked really well for me. A lovely blend of silly and sophisticated."
38,The Boxtrolls,9,6 February 2015,"very smart film, very bad marketing","I don't want to write much because I don't want to give much away, but IMDb demands Proustian verbosity to be published so I try my best. Its a very smart movie that works on multiple levels, kids will like it as much as adults well versed in Sartre. It is social commentary, its also very entertaining. The art direction is very much in keeping with the story, its not a story of princesses, its a story of box trolls. Everything is quirky and clunky and covered in a layer of soot, and that is exactly how it should be. I almost skipped this because the marketing was so bad, I am glad I didn't. Easily one of the top 5 of 2014."
39,The Boxtrolls,6,10 January 2015,The Boxtrolls,"Yet another children's book adaptation that I have never heard of even though its British apparently. The book in question is called 'Here Be Monsters!' and is actually part of a series, so should we expect a series of films also? This has been attempted a few times in the past since the mighty Harry Potter but many have failed. I must also admit to getting tired of these quick-fire fast food franchises that are whipped up and thrown out willy nilly to try and rake in as much money as possible. Sure its a business but judging by various past failures how about some care and attention huh.Luckily this isn't another cash grab strewn with CGI but a delightfully dark hand crafted stop motion animated movie. Set in the fictional old English town of Cheesebridge in the year 1805. The town appears to be a large vertical hill protruding from a flat green landscape, the buildings are cobbled tightly together almost one on top of the other to create a towering spire of rickety pre-Victorian structures (not overly sure what period the movie is actually aiming for, if any). Yet the visuals are reasonably realistic historically, 19th century England with a strong French vibe about them. I guess that wouldn't be surprising considering the Napoleonic era was still in full swing. So despite the fictional murky, gloomy, dark, twisted appearance it does seem as though the period has been recreated which is nice although its a fantasy version.Without trying to sound to cliché myself the movies visuals are very Tim Burton-esque in a way. That traditional olde worlde, gnarly, dark semi-Gothic, dank fairytale look with grotesque over the top characters (especially the villains). This all goes hand in hand with the period set buildings, narrow winding streets, underground boxtroll lair and of course all finished in a limited dark rusty muddy colour palette. Most of the decent everyday folk in this town and the main goodie characters are normal looking as you would expect, its the small group of bad guys that are the most deformed and twisted...bordering on scary for the kids to be honest. All the characters are pretty much like caricatures of real people, almost political satirisations if you will. Yet the bad guys are by far the most interesting and fun, listening to Ben Kingsley churn out his cockney accent for the quite hideous Mr. Snatcher is the showstopper for sure. A quite horrible fellow who has an allergic reaction to cheese (I think the town makes cheese?) that makes him appear even more horrendous! By his side are a trio of your stereotypical cockney villains...slow, dumb, ugly and easily dominated.As for the trolls well they're a cute little bunch really, little dark green goblin-like characters of all shapes and sizes that make various growling noises as their language. They also wear cardboard boxes around their torso. The cardboard boxes are (from what I've read about with the book) a newish invention for the time and another product from the town which is heavily industrialised. There are many changes from the book it seems, including other creatures underground, a completely different plot line and lots of name changes such as the town of Cheesebridge, in the book its called Ratbridge. This did make me think as there are so many alterations from the original book I wondered how fans would take it, the movie has done relatively well so I guess no one is too bothered. I can understand this because despite the film not being very accurate to its source material its still a gorgeous work of art that must be commended.There is a tonne of vivid imagination and detail all throughout the film, in every scene from the steampunk-like contraptions, to the period costumes, to the buildings and to the highly expressive animated faces and boxtroll tomfoolery. I wouldn't even say its particularly a film for kids either, its quite dark and a little disturbing in places. The capturing of the boxtrolls by the evil Mr. Snatcher who wants to kill them all with his crushing machine! there's a touch of murder, intrigue, cross-dressing and even some off-key Frenchy music...just what the kids wanna see. On the plus side there is also plenty of little amusing quirky gross moments for the kids courtesy of the boxtrolls and their nose-picking antics.Clearly this is a visual film much like any other stop motion animated feature, it relies on that. To its credit the movie does come out with plus points for me purely for this reason, but the plot can be a tad slow and mundane I can't lie. If it wasn't for the superbly dastardly Mr. Snatcher voiced by Ben Kingsley I think this would have been very drab despite the excellent visuals. If you don't know the book then I'm sure you can enjoy if you like this sort of thing. If you do know the book then maybe you won't agree with me so much...I dunno, there are many changes. Plenty of originality but maybe not quite as much wonder for the kids, check out the lovely animated end credit sequence too.6.5/10"
40,The Boxtrolls,8,9 January 2018,"A simple, but cute film.","Ever since Laika came into the spotlight in 2009, they have crafted some fantastic stop motion animated movies starting with ""Coraline"". The movies which are technically crafted by hand are brought to life with the use of photography and careful movement of puppets which I have always loved seeing. Now, we have the next movie from the studio known as ""The Boxtrolls"". It's an impressive looking movie with many cute moments, but maybe it's a little too cute and simple for audiences tastes especially considering the other animated movies that came out the year it came out. Want to know why? Well, I'll explain.In the hill topped village known as Cheesebridge, the antagonistic Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) has been trying to hunt and exterminate the trolls in the city known as the box trolls (the reason is because they wear cardboard boxes) after they have kidnapped and supposedly killed a baby in hopes to join the elite group known as the White Hats so he can try the many cheeses they taste despite being lactose intolerant. The trolls in reality have raised the baby boy known as Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright) has lived in secret with the trolls helping top protect them from the exterminators and turning discarded objects into creative inventions. Years go by and Eggs has continued to live with the trolls when he is discovered by the daughter of the leader of Cheesebridge, Winnie (Elle Fanning). Disgusted by the way the town sees the trolls, Eggs tries to convince Winnie to see the reality of the trolls and free them from the evil Archibald Snatcher. I think you can figure out the rest from there.Though I did enjoy the film, I did have some problems that may make some people a little disappointed. The story of the film is a nice and simple story, it isn't as big as Laika's previous movies . I remember how huge a movie like ""Coraline"" was especially with it's climax and comparing it with this film did make me wish that there should have been more to it. Even the ending of this film was a little anticlimactic in a way. As for the animation, it's once again fantastic. I really appreciate the time and effort that the artists went into creating the details of the film. The village in particular was very impressive. I loved how huge it was and how much tiny details were added into it. Even the character animation was very smooth and felt perfect. Now, how are the characters? Pretty good. I liked how cute the boxtrolls were, thought Archibald Snatcher was a great villain brought to life by a fantastic performance by Ben Kingsley, and really liked the attitude that Elle Fanning brought to Winnie. As for Eggs, he could have been a better main character. I thought he was pretty bland at times and should have been written a little better at times. He wasn't a bad character, but he just wasn't very memorable. I think that was about it.""The Boxtrolls"" is definitely a very cute movie with a decent simple story, fantastic animation, and some mostly good characters. I don't think it's up there with Laika's best movies as I do think this is there weakest effort to date though I can easily say that the movie is nowhere near awful. It's was a very nice movie and it's easily something I can watch again."
41,The Boxtrolls,9,27 December 2017,An interesting idea,"In a fantastic world where cheese is the most valuable thing, the inhabitants have a big problem. They must hide in their houses at night because of some awkward creatures which roam the streets and steal all sorts of objects. Among them, happens to be a kid which thinks he's one of them, who's about to find some disturbing truths and, of course, do something about the situation.It's a beautiful and original stop-motion animation which features some cute and funny creatures, which, only on their own are a recipe for success, let alone in a full movie like this one. It tells a pretty interesting story which describes the emotional adventures of a boy, struggling to adapt and make people realize the truth that's been standing right in front of them for a very long time.It's interesting and a pleasant watch but unfortunately there is nothing groundbreaking or impressive about it. It's a very good animation, but pretty far from ""The Big Ones""."
42,The Boxtrolls,9,29 November 2017,Dark and funny; another delight from Studio Laika,"In the town of Cheesebridge to citizens live in fear of the sewer-dwelling Boxtrolls who emerge at night and reportedly took and devoured a baby! Archibald Snatcher offers to catch and exterminate the monsters in exchange for a place on the town council so he can eat fine cheese and converse with the upper echelons of Cheesebridge society. It turns out that the stories about the Boxtrolls are untrue; far from eating the baby they raised him as one of their own; now known as Eggs he thinks he is a Boxtroll. One night he is seen Winnie, the daughter of city leader Lord Portley-Rind, who is fascinated with the Boxtrolls and the horrible things they are rumoured to do. After Egg's friend, Fish, is captured he returns to the surface and is shocked to learn what the people think about the Boxtrolls; he approaches Winnie to ask where Snatcher takes the captured trolls. He manages to rescue Fish and learns a shocking truth about Snatcher; if he is to save his friends he will have to work with Winnie and the Boxtrolls to defeat Snatcher.As with other films from Laika this film has some delightfully dark moments Winnie's theories about what Boxtrolls do to people are particularly gruesome and there are some scary moments might scare younger children. Older children and adult viewers should really enjoy it though. The Boxtrolls are strangely endearing and the villain is delightfully grotesque and gets worse when he eats the cheese he so desperately craves. There are times when it looks as if something bad happens to characters we are meant to like but in each case we later learn they are okay. Not surprisingly the stop-go animation is very good and the setting is beautifully realised with a really grungy look and some nice steampunk features. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of Laika's other films or of animated features in general."
43,The Boxtrolls,,27 December 2016,nice  job,"colorful, didactic, seductive, exploration of an universe who is ours in each detail, adventure and touching lessons, it is the perfect choice for a large public. sure, it is far to be surprising but it has the virtue to remind in smart manner, old truths in the right manner. and this is the most important detail. because it is a kind of holiday with deep roots who impose a different perspective to the ordinary reality. result - a kind of parable about social differences, love, happiness and friendship, desires and selfishness.and this does Boxtrolls perfect choice for a comfortable afternoon. because it is a nice work who has not exactly the desire to demonstrate a thesis but remind its essence."
44,The Boxtrolls,,18 May 2015,"A claymation fantasy, gentle Boxtrolls are misunderstood.","I viewed this on DVD from my public library. It has a number of interesting extras on the DVD, and a couple of time-lapse shots of an animator sequentially moving the claymation figures to generate an animated sequence.When I initially tried to watch this I turned it off after maybe 10 or 12 minutes. It was too ugly and dark to be fun. A few days later I tried again and it really picks up after 15 or 16 minutes when the story gets above ground again.It is a strange fantasy city where an ogre of a man and his helpers have convinced the general population that the Boxtrolls are monsters, they kidnap and eat children, citing the disappearance some 10 or so years earlier of a baby. The Boxtrolls are sort of like Hermit crabs, taking a discarded shell for their homes. But these discarded shells are cardboard boxes, and each gets his name from what was in the box originally, like ""Eggs"" or ""Fish."" They live underground and come out at night to collect items that have been discarded and make things with them. And in fact, the boy called Eggs, now about 10, was raised by the Boxtrolls because the boy's father, afraid the ogre would kill him, asked them to take him. When Eggs finally dresses like a normal boy and goes above ground, he finds out the lies being told about the Boxtrolls and helps to make things right.The movie is filled with fine voice actors, and I will mention three. Ben Kingsley is the main bad guy, Archibald Snatcher, who loves cheese but has an allergy and a very bad reaction (swelling of hands, feet, face) when he eats even a tiny bit. Newcomer Isaac Hempstead Wright is the boy, Eggs. And Elle Fanning is the girl Winnie, who starts out as a spoiled rich girl but ends up helping Eggs.This doesn't seem to be an animated movie for kids, in fact it may be hard to state what the target audience is, but it is interesting especially for the great job they did with the animation. However it will never become one of my favorite animated movies."
45,The Boxtrolls,2,6 October 2014,This Movie Definitely is Targeted for the Audience of Children,"I did not find this movie amusing at all when it came to the storyline. In my opinion every thing happened all too fast. The clay animation was phenomenal...to think about all the time and effort put into the actions were amazing. I think some parts of the movie had too much adult humor and that all they needed to do is to keep the funny simple. The movie did have potential if the storyline matched the clay animation but it is no doubt in my mind that the clay animation took precedence over the storyline for sure. My children loved The Boxtrolls but myself not at all. I recommend that potential viewers go in the early morning to view this movie for cheaper. This movie is about two hours so make sure potty breaks are taken before the movie and grab frozen drinks versus sodas. Point blank, this movie was made for the child in mind not the adult taking the children. This movie would have been on point if the storyline was just as spectacular. I give this move a 2 out of 10 because both my daughter and son loved the movie."
46,The Boxtrolls,3,2 December 2014,Don't bother,"This movie crosses the line from ""appeals to children"" to an almost psychotic break from reality. I'll admit I was dragged to this one, but for all the weird genres I can appreciate, this one is a bridge too far. The characters are all way over-exaggerated, likely for fear of offending anyone who might have resembled these characters had they been more realistic. The characters exist in a world as non-sensical as Candyland but irritatingly decorated too much like a real city.There was one part that nearly redeems the whole movie, and that's when Eggs learns to shake hands. I won't spoil it, but it was exactly what the rest of this movie should have been.I guess what gets me the most about this is all the failed emotional development. Why does anyone hate boxtrolls? How can our bad guy so calmly enslave and then execute? How are his henchmen so incredibly dumb? How can all authority figures be so psychotically fixed on cheese? I could go on and on, but the only characters I might not lock up in a nut house are Eggs and Fish.I've had a similar opinion of every other stop-motion animation I've been exposed to too, so maybe there's something about this forum that attracts the same creative teams. Nightmare Before Christmas...Claymation...even much of Robot Chicken. Perhaps the pain of the forum bleeds through into the story :-/"
47,The Boxtrolls,5,1 October 2014,"Animation is impressive, but the film is only intermittently entertaining.","Coming after their brilliant Coraline and fun filled ParaNorman, the latest Claymation flick from Laika Entertainment doesn't quite reach the heights of its ancestors. As always, the meticulous stop motion animation is wondrous to watch and, for the cineastes in the audience, appreciating the painstaking effort is a pleasure in its own right. Yet there's a spark missing from The Boxtrolls that stops it transitioning from appreciated art to an outright enjoyable movie. The story  the harmless, underground-dwelling creatures of the title are being ruthlessly exterminated, causing the boy they raised from birth to stand up for them  just doesn't have the legs necessary for a 90 minute outing, nor does it offer up enough laughs for what is meant to be a dark comedy. Another problem is that the preposterously stereotypical characters all act the exact way you would expect (Ben Kingsley's sneering, oily scoundrel Archibald Snatcher is particularly uninteresting), leaving no room for surprise or genuine affection. Hence all the heavy lifting is left to the superb stop motion animation, a few choice chase sequences and cheeky visual references; enough to keep you impressed but only intermittently entertained."
48,The Boxtrolls,7,28 October 2014,"This movie is indeed kinda square. Still, it was alright.","I'm don't want to be trolling here, but this movie is pretty mediocre. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of things that the film does so well, but there are so many things that they could had done to make it, more appealing. Boxtrolls was too comically distorted. Produced by Laika, the film has the same feature that 2009 Coraline & 2012 ParaNorman. The film will disturb some young viewers while thoroughly also bored some of their parents. Directed by Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi, this 3D stop motion animated fantasy-comedy film based on the novel Here Be Monsters! by Alan Snow is about a human boy, Egg (Voiced by Isaac Hempstead-Wright), a human boy raised by trash-collecting trolls, as he attempts to save them from Archibald Snatcher (Voiced by Ben Kingsley), a pest exterminator. While, the movie concept is pretty new, it follows a very cliché story. Still, I enjoyed the film. The first half of the film was kinda boring as it's establishing its world, but the second half, humor and action made up for it. The movie has a lot of heart, toward it. I loved some of the overarching themes that the movie presented, like family, standing up for yourself, and how to be a better parent. Viewers watching it could see the film as a metaphor to the Holocaust. Like the trolls, the Jews were killed off due to negative propaganda & misguided hate. A lot of people believe the movie is social commentary about same-sex marriage since the first teaser trailer include that in their statement. Yet others might look at it, as a movie about social class warfare, between mistreatment of the poor to the self-centered snobbish of the rich. Anyways, whatever, people see in it. Each one seems to never get fully conceived or given a rather ham fisted resolution. The plot is paper thin with continuity inconsistencies & things left unexplained. The movie is so cobbled together story wise. I believe that characters that needed to be more fleshed out for me to care more about. Eggs is pretty good as the main role. Still, it's a bit off for somebody like Egg whom was raise by Boxtrolls to speak English, very well and know the meaning to those words. The boxtrolls are pretty cute. You really feel invested in the relationship between them and Eggs. The box-trolls are cute as all hell, and are not there just to be toy-selling comic relief; they have purpose. Yet, they play second fiddle to their own movie. The adult characters are just bad. The entire town really, but a special mention should go to Lord Portley-Rind (Voiced by Jared Harris) are just downright 'I want them to die' annoying. When did Nigel Thornberry became such a dick?! The villain, Archibald Snatcher and his henchmen were pretty menacing and lot the humor, about him wanting cheese despite him, being lactose intolerance. One thing, I don't get is why he has a cross dresser persona of Frou Frou. Did he need a whole other persona to continue the myth that the Boxtrolls were really monsters? He's already doing that as Snatcher. I guess it was meant as a way for him to try and integrate himself more into the upper classes, but because that's not especially clear, it seems a bit thrown in there. Winnie (Voiced by Ellie Fanning) comes off as too much of a bossy for me to really like her or for me to believe that Eggs would either. It doesn't hurt the character or the film, but it makes it harder to believe that the movie was somewhat shoehorning them as love-interests. Another problem of the character is that Fanning voice over comes across more adult like, than childlike. After all, this girl hasn't yet reach puberty. The other voice acting is alright for the most part, but for her, she was a bit jarring. The stop-motion animation was the right balance of gross design-wise so that it's still appealing to look at. The movie remind me of Tim Burton & Harry Selick 1993's Nightmare before Christmas mixed with Nick Park's Wallace & Gromit films. I love the steam punk feel to it. It remind me of the game, Bioshock Infite. The movie does have charming moments. Surprisingly, I did get a little choked up at a couple of scenes. The movie also has that odd British Mothy Python type of humor. Yes, the movie does contain excessive use of potty humor and naughty gags, but it wasn't too overbearing. The one scene at the party, alone, was the highlight of film. It was just funny. I didn't even mind the horrible cheesy puns. One thing, I didn't like is the singing. While, there isn't a lot of music, the music, they played were just annoying. Another fault is how loose the movie is to the book. It felt like leftovers, most of the time. I just wish, it was more faithful to the book. Overall: The movie pacing is a bit rush. The movie watches more like a quirky, hour and half long short than a thought-provoking, groundbreaking film. Still, go see this movie & stay for the credits for the cover song ""Little Boxes"" by Malvinia Reynolds & a world discussion between Snatcher's henchmen. Films like these, will gather a cult-following. Still, I kinda wish, they made the film, a little more appealing."
49,The Boxtrolls,7,7 October 2014,The Boxtrolls was a nice stop-motion animated film about prejudice,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both seemed to enjoy this English tale of a group of creatures called the Boxtrolls who end up raising a human boy. This boy encounters a girl who's the daughter of someone very important. There are also some villains-well, one really despicable bad guy-who very much wants to get rid of these creatures. I'll stop there and just say that while it took some time before I got into the rhythm of the story, by the time it segued to a party, I was really into it to the point I was really cheering for the title characters and the boy and girl who support them! And it was both funny, touching, and a little scary during the last 20 or so minutes, that's for sure! So on that note, I highly recommend The Boxtrolls."
50,The Boxtrolls,10,30 September 2014,This stunning achievement in animation unmasks . . .,". . . the gluttony of Corporate America. While it's tempting to dwell upon THE BOXTROLLS' winning visuals, deft plotting, better Minions, and innovative story-telling, that would involve ignoring the forest by focusing on its trees. When adults are hauling impressionable children to the show at forty or fifty a crack (counting refreshments), it gives families a bigger bang for their buck if the movie-makers can subtly work in a vital social message that their local church no longer has the guts to convey. In THE BOXTROLLS, the ""Archibald Penelope Snatcher"" character uses his personal agenda to manipulate the corporate types of ""Cheesebridge"" town (who no doubt have suffered too many sports concussions, just like the American business and military leaders of today, to exercise any semblance of critical thinking). The leaders of Cheesebridge view ordinary people as less important than the boxes in which their luxury goods are delivered. They divert money raised for a children's hospital to gluttonous gorging on rotten cheese (apparently forgetting that ""You are what you eat""). They engage Mr. Snatcher to exterminate the town's homeless population. Even when their own young object to their End Times behavior as the gulf between Cheesebridge's One Per Centers and the Poor hits its historic high, the Fat Cat parents are too busy feeding their faces to pay the least bit of attention to their kids. Cheesebridge comes to its senses as the last moment possible. Will America?"
51,The Boxtrolls,9,29 September 2014,This is very smart,"Our group was comprised of two adults in their 40's and two children aged 9 and 13. We all liked it very much. This is a subversive little film that will probably offend some. The film tackles two problems with modern society. Firstly, it examines society's pride in gaining material wealth. It is amusingly represented in the movie by a lower class villain's need to join a group of wealthy cheese connoisseurs (even though he is allergic to cheese). The film's viewpoint is that your leopard Gucci handbag doesn't make the person, rather the things you do make the person.Secondly, there is interesting theme found in how the people view the box trolls. The people have been manipulated into believing the box trolls are vicious killers when in fact they are gentle scroungers. How easy the people are manipulated and how they don't want to think for themselves is a criticism of modern society as well.Does this all sound heavy handed? It's not really presented that way. The kids loved it and so did the adults. Although if you are a politician; or a member of the American Corporate world; or if you believe your Gucci bag makes you better than your neighbor, you probably won't like this."
52,The Boxtrolls,6,13 October 2014,Watchable but there is far better stop-motion projects to watch on Halloween season,"At first, I was skeptical about this movie. I didn't think that this young girl in it would make it appealing enough. And I heard she was too harsh and spoiled. But I decided to give the movie a try and I used to like her but now I understand that these characters were not good enough as well as the story. The only character that I like is the under-appreciated Eggs, the main character, he's a good boy, amicable, adorable and positive and it really made me get attached to him, but even he isn't the best character ever, but he may receive a nomination for being one of the best male characters. But his disgusting personality is what turns me off. Especially with that annoying Winnie character showing him how to have proper manners and gets mean. Though, she is definitely no Penny from Mr. Peabody & Sherman, that's for sure.The film may be alright for a few watches, but the saccharine scenes, hard-to-follow storyline, underdeveloped and weird characters, over-the-top silly humor, and overly mature yet childish themes only makes it appealing to little kids. Whether you like the humor or not, it still doesn't offer very much to make it as appealing as ""Coraline"" or ""Paranorman"". Paranorman is my favorite one, though they aren't my favorites, Eggs tops all the protagonists for me but even he could've had better situations to go through. I know he's only 11, life sucks at that age but is that enough? Or shouldn't they come up with a better conflict or maybe develop it?His voice sounds nasal and whiny compared to the excellent voice cast from everyone.Unlike Frozen, it adds silly humor, grotesque things, more clichés, little emotional punch, bizarre characters and another mean sidekick that I want to choke and hit. The action is predictable and so are Eggs and Winnie. There is not much to remember about this film, some scenes you can just forget in a flash. Either that or I couldn't pay much attention to it, it was just too silly, childish, and overall, not alluring enough.Overall, this film may be good to watch around Halloween, but it still doesn't have enough interesting things going on in it to make it the best film to watch around Halloween. You can choose something different such as ""Nightmare Before Christmas"". It's moreso something for older kids and young teenagers. I wouldn't let anyone younger than about 6 or 7 view this movie, the first part is a nice little childish wonder but the second part just turns it around. There is a little more effort to put in Eggs, the story, and theme like they did with Coraline, it wouldn't bother me so much if this kids' film had interesting mature themes as well as make it suitable and healthy enough for the little ones. This movie is the most mature children's film out there, especially that scene where the boxtrolls got killed and Eggs crying, holding his head. I am glad that this even won't be very popular and possibly for generations compared to Tim Burton's film's popularity because it's not good for very young kids plus it's pretty annoying. Also, has some stupid scenes to it. I suggest watching some other movie for Halloween. This is by far, the worst children's movie to watch during Halloween."
53,The Boxtrolls,4,9 October 2014,As dark and English as a figgy pudding,"You want to like Boxtrolls just out of appreciation for the 5 years of intricate, teeny movements the animators must have had to live through to bring this stop motion fairy tale to the screen. It's hard. A fat man explodes just like Mr. Creosole in Monty Python's ""Meaning of Life"", a tinker/father is hung upside-down with chains in a baseball for a full decade and leeches are used to treat horrific cheese allergy symptoms. More of a Grimm's Fairy Tale than the feel-good time to be sure. The dialog at times rises above the 72% cacao-dark mood with lines like: ""I regret so much"" uttered by Lord Portly Rind after learning the torch singer he lusts after is a cross-dresser. Although most of the jokes are droll and dry in that British way which won't play widely with an American juvenile audience. The message of tolerance and acceptance does stumble a bit given the Boxtrolls are, in fact, petty thieves who do clean the town out every night. And, frankly, they eat bugs. Elle Fanning is a bright spot and her line when she resigns herself to be eaten by the Boxtrolls: ""I'm sure I'm delicious"" is spot on. Might make a better book. In short, rent ""The Princess Bride"" instead."
54,The Boxtrolls,8,21 December 2014,"Personally, i love this movie.","I just watched this movie after having it on the watch list for a couple of months. Been wanting to know what interests me in the first place ever since I watched the trailer.Was it the quirky idea of cute little trolls hiding in a box? Or was it the idea of trolls afraid of humans and only came out during the evening? Or simply because the animation, and because the movie-trailer editing was fascinating? Ah, I'm quite certain that mostly because the casts are those bunch of creative artists whose previous works I deeply adored.The first thing that I found extremely different was the dialog. Then the characters. I am smitten with the Winnifred character, so ironically adorable. Then the comedy. (Oh how I love the idea of a ""wealthy girl in danger"" -- such cynical dark humor. Not everybody's cup of tea, obviously, but it definitely suits mine.) Lastly, the moral of this story. (This is actually the most significant part of this movie that made me infatuated. So much reminders delivered by the movie makers to adults and teenagers with a flair of hilarity and flawless depth -- actually, scratch that, there's a lot of flaws in this movie but the flaws what made this movie having so much to enjoy about.) And lastly, it has a touch of philosophical end. (with an exquisite mention of the meta- related worlds)."
55,The Boxtrolls,8,31 October 2014,Strong entertainment for all ages,"To me, The Boxtrolls is not as good as Coraline and Paranorman(both pretty brilliant films), which had a touch more charm and imagination, but anyone who enjoyed those two will have no problem enjoying The Boxtrolls just as much. Some of the story's pacing does feel rather rushed, especially for the first thirty minutes or so, and there are a few aimless parts that don't go anywhere, but while it might also be simplistic at times for some(mainly characterisation-wise) there is not much wrong actually that is wrong with The Boxtrolls. The animation is beautifully done and hugely inventive, with a superbly meticulous eye for detail(ie. the troll's glowing eyes) and the designs and dark atmosphere in the visual style make the film a treat to look at. The music is breezy, giving you a real sense of adventure, but there is a haunting quality for the darker moments without being too obvious. The effort made with the animation is matched too generally with the script and story. The script is filled with offbeat wit with some great surreal humour, there is also a lot of heart and warmth(the ending actually did resonate with me) to it too and the messages the film conveys are relevant and used with subtlety while making the point still. The stories for Coraline and Paranorman may be more charming and imaginative but The Boxtrolls is certainly not devoid of those two qualities, there is a darkly surreal atmosphere and some brilliantly wild slapstick created while never being devoid of emotion. The storytelling itself is rushed in places but flows smoothly and is rarely dull(though with the odd aimless stretch), it's also told clearly and I don't actually think there's actually anything for a child to be scared about. If children and adults alike can find something to enjoy here, it's done a good job as a family film. The characters are archetypally simple but still very entertaining, especially Snatcher, the trolls are cute and amusing and the lead characters while a touch wan are likable at least. The voice acting is great from everybody with Ben Kingsley as Snatcher particularly so, he is simply born to voice villains and along with the animation and script is one of the three main high points of the film. Overall, not the best from Laika but plenty of strong entertainment all round. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
56,The Boxtrolls,8,28 September 2014,"Dark, Fun, and Kids will Enjoy.","I love stop motion movies, with the incredible worlds they craft, the often-unique art design, and the colorful characters that act in the worlds. With movies like Paranorman, and the Corpse Bride, I was eager to check out the latest movie in this genre entitled The Boxtrolls. Like always though, my skepticism remained at large as to just how good this movie would be when looking at some of the reviews and ratings. So what was it the grand verdict? As always, read on to find out.For those who haven't been drowned by the deluge of trailers on T.V., the plot from the trailer is a little boy winds up adopted by the box trolls, an underground living society of tinkerers and inventors. These creatures have been branded as monsters, and thus warranted for removal by the mayor of the town. It's up to that boy and his gang of trolls to change the town's perspective, all without getting caught by the hunters. Sounds cute right? In truth, the movie has a bit darker quality behind it that ,although shocking, adds some spice to the mix. Now before you get caught up in the dark, the directors have tapered the darkness to a younger audience group. This reviewer didn't see anything too grotesque, disturbing, or scary that would scar a kid for life, the exception being the bloated form of one of the characters. It does, however provide some twists to the plot, helping to develop a few of the characters who seemed one-dimensional from the trailers. Some of these twists can be a bit sad to younger audience members who may not have the foresight to see through the predictable story. So I encourage you to tell your youngsters that everything will be all right should they get upset? Overall the story is cute and fun, matching the delightfully innocent nature of the trolls. Of course many kids will most likely not get that involved in the story, but instead be looking for the humor and laughs. From what I observed in my showing, this movie is chock full of gags and jokes that will make the young ones laugh. Characters crashing into walls, the trolls falling into an accident as a result of their curiosity, or just the sounds and facial expressions of the characters are all in this movie. Those who are not as young of heart may not appreciate the ridiculous antics of this film, either due to the lack of adult based humor, or the fact that they have seen most of these scenes in the trailers. In fact the only thing they might find funny is how ridiculous the denizens of the town are, especially the selfish nature of the aristocratic caste and their obsession with cheese. Once or twice I found myself chuckling at their obsessions, and how everything went back to the stinky dairy product. Other than that, you're out of luck with the comedy and should maybe think of focusing on your kid's laughter to get the most out of the experience. My favorite part of the movie though is the world and characters themselves. The trolls in particular are truly fun and colorful, each having a personality quirk that is symbolized by the very box they wear. Like the dwarfs of Snow White, these characters each serve a purpose to the group, though we really only get to see a handful do anything in the short time limit. While they also look very similar, the team did put individual qualities to them, helping them stand out a bit. The humans in this movie are all comically built, many having some grandiose feature that seemed to match the nature of the town. Of course Eggs, the main character, and his female friend Winnie have the most diversity of the group, which is to be expected from the main protagonist. Even the town is fun, as both above and below ground aspects have that same Tim Burton like flare that got us hooked on stop motion long ago. The buildings are angular and boxed in, designed to look like a town built inside a castle, with a few regal qualities to smooth out the slums of this English like town. Underground though is where the real magic is. Here the creativity of the team shines the most, with the boxtrolls treasures being arranged in a mosaic of mechanical inventions that make them almost a self-contained ecosystem. It's colorful, it's fun, and it's creative, all components I like to see in my set design. Everything comes together nicely, and the animation is almost flawless throughout the film, only occasionally stumbling or choppy at parts. The Boxtrolls is definitely not the most unique movie I've ever seen. A predictable plot with obvious character directions take away from the excitement of the story, and the lack of adult humor limits the audience members who may enjoy it. However, this is a stop motion adventure that is fun, and well designed to keep you into the film, helping to offset the boring aspects of the movie. Again this is a bit darker than some of the other animated films for kids, but I don't see it being a problem for most. Is it worth a trip to the theater? For this reviewer, I think it is fun, though I don't know about the 3-D quality and how much it adds so you're on your own. Yet, there is really nothing special that a home theater system couldn't bring you into. My scores for this movie are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"
57,The Boxtrolls,8,27 September 2014,Once again falling in love with the art of stop motion animation,"The studio, Lanka turns it up a notch with the Boxtrolls, and they would have to trying to follow up their brilliant last theatrical release, Paranorman. Everyone favors CGI and no one is doing stop motion, which will all ways give Lanka a unique feel in all their movies.Boxtrolls is a classic children's tale about a boy raised by misunderstood Boxtrolls and teaches us the lesson of choosing are own path in life. The stop motion characters add a griminess to the tale. It has all the elements of a Disney formula, but it's a little darker.The voice over talents of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Ben Kingsly added to the humor of the picture. My favorite performances were from Elle Fanning who played a weird little girl who loved to be scared by the Boxtrolls and Richard Ayoade who played a philosophical henchman who does not realize he's on the wrong side.Overall, It's hard for me to say which movie I liked more Paranorman or Boxtrolls, But Boxtrolls does show an improvement in story telling. Worth taking a look at."
58,The Boxtrolls,6,27 September 2014,"Visually arresting, witty, and slightly disgusting.","The uneven yet entirely unique style of stop motion takes years to master, and takes almost as long to actually make a feature film with it. When stop motion films finally do enter theaters, they tend to fall short at the box office in comparison to their hand drawn and computer generated counterparts. Even still, they have die-hard fanatics across the globe acclaiming them for their charm, wit, social commentary, and delightfully dark tone. That being said, I have no idea what audience ""The Boxtrolls"" is trying to target. Based on the story ""Here Be Monsters!"" by Alan Snow, the third animated feature from Laika Studios has bucket loads of humor, incredible animation, dark flavors and important morals, all of which are blown entirely out of proportion. In the town of Cheesebridge, after the cheese-obsessed snobbery of high society goes to sleep, blue skinned inventors named Boxtrolls roam the night, looking for parts to use for their ingenious contraptions below the city. When the town pest exterminator Archibald Snatcher captures more and more Boxtrolls, it is up to Eggs (voiced by Isaac Hempsted Wright), a boy raised by Boxtrolls, to rescue his fellow gremlins and bridge the gap between humans and Boxtrolls.The most annoying aspect regarding ""The Boxtrolls"" is that the filmmakers had everything in their favor. Every frame floods with visual splendor, almost every joke hits a home run, and the opening setup should allow for the film to exert radiant charm. All of these elements remain in the final product, yet relentless stop-motion grotesqueness overshadows them. The directors get so caught up with taking a traditional, basic story and making it their own that they remove any subtlety the movie might have had, abusing the powers of stop-motion more than once along the way. Most of the unpleasantness hails from the villain Archibald Snatcher, voiced by the great Ben Kingsley. Both Kingsley and the animators work to create a disgustingly flamboyant villain among the lines of the child catchers from ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"" yet the tipsy camera movements and sickly design of the character lead to the most revolting villainous concoction since Terl from ""Battlefield Earth."" In one scene where Snatcher sings anti-Boxtroll propaganda as his cross dressed alter-identity Madam Frou-Frou, I felt my stomach tighten in a way that it hasn't felt since I saw two minutes of ""The Human Centipede."" The dark environment works some scenes, yet for others, it goes on for way too long.For a film that attempts to satirize the posh ridiculousness of upper class culture, ""The Boxtrolls"" unfortunately decides to bask in obviousness. Knowing that this movie was made for kids, I expected some sort of moral regarding prejudice or equality. I really hoped that it would not have to come from some kid standing on a box (pun intended) yelling ""They're not the monsters, you are!"" or something like that. For ten minutes. With another third act to go. One of the reoccurring jokes comes from Snatchers henchmen, who loaf on their job to break the fourth wall over and over again. The simple irony only became more and more irritating each time it occurred. I never have liked the phrase ""It's only a kid's movie"" as an excuse to dismiss lazy writing, and it certainly shouldn't apply to a movie that should have been far more astute. Speaking of children, I am sure that there will be many angry parents whose kids started having nightmares because of this movie, insisting that it is a menace to healthy growth in children. While I won't say that this movie should be called a ""kids film,"" you should take your kids anyways as long as they are able to speak properly. If not, you might want to wait a couple of years. ""The Boxtrolls"" has some serious flaws, mainly it's inherent ugliness and obvious writing. Even so, it remains hilarious, visually spectacular, and highly imaginative. Those who crave the dark and edgy unapologetically will certainly not be disappointed."
59,The Boxtrolls,9,25 September 2014,Excellent animated fantasy.,"Get ready to enjoy a beautifully crafted world with stunningly well animated characters. If you're familiar with Laika's other films, this will come as no surprise. As before, the visuals are worth the price of admission. And as before, I was left hungry for more.The film itself is a well-told fantasy full of silliness and whimsy, but there's depth and meaning as well. It could be argued that this is a kids film about ethnic cleansing and genocide(!), but it's all handled in the best possible taste. Somehow they managed to pull this off without ever being too heavy or inappropriate. This isn't going to provoke nightmares or scar anyone for life, and is neither heavy-handed nor patronizing in getting its lesson across. An example of this would be the villain's henchmen, who spend much of the film in the mistaken belief that they're the good guys. It's not so much a film about good vs evil, as it is good vs foolishness.It's also a world with a visible class system, where aloof aristocrats are so distracted with their ridiculous hobby that real world problems are neglected. There are interesting parallels to be drawn in this subtle bit of social commentary. From my perspective this was essentially apolitical, I don't expect any particular group to take offense at this. It shows the folly of aspiring to empty symbols of status. There's more than enough going on in the film that you don't really have to think about any of this if you prefer to just sit back and be entertained. You could easily spend another viewing just taking in the beautifully detailed sets full of crooked buildings on cobble-stoned streets, and the immaculately tailored costumes, all of it so tactile and vivid in three dimensions you'll want to reach out. If you're the kind of person that would love to interact and play around with all these props and puppets, I recommend seeing it in 3d. It's like having them right there in front of you. Aside from the window dressing, there's good characterisations all round. The Box Trolls themselves are particularly adorable, and endlessly amusing with their antics. Watching them bounce around and assemble themselves into various formations was a thrill. Expect some of the most inventive animation seen to date.Stick around during the credit roll, there's a final post/mid credit scene that will make your jaw drop. The talent involved with the stop-motion animation makes this film a joy to behold.Overall, I'd go so far as to say it's a future classic. It seems destined to be fondly remembered for years to come."
60,The Boxtrolls,7,1 August 2015,Surprisingly Good,"As soon as the movie started I was cringing. ""Oh dear,"" I thought, ""here's another uninspired, hopeless stop-motion experience.""As a general rule, I despise stop-motion movies, Fantastic Mr. Fox springs to mind immediately. In my mind, the only way that a stop-motion movie can ever redeem itself from the caverns of hopelessness is if the story carries it completely. Now, don't get me wrong, the plot of The Boxtrolls did have a few holes and well, some things that just didn't make sense. However, it flows logically and the funny dialogue was enough for me to gloss over the negatives.I've seen a lot of people complaining about how this is a children's movie and it's not really suitable/cute/dumbed-down enough to be labelled as such. In my view, I think the time of animation merely for children has long since passed and The Boxtrolls delivers a punchy, fun movie, with it's great voice acting and almost dystopian visuals."
61,The Boxtrolls,10,15 June 2015,>Frabjous flick. Callooh Calley.,"This movie is many many things. One of my favorite stop-motion movies of all time I dare say. The humour is just about dark enough to attract elderly personalities such as myself.Who is the true villain?Who is the true hero?Just go, see it, watch. Watch. With whomever! Big or small, rich or tall?IT DOES NOT MATTER. You WILL enjoy what you see. If not, well... there is pity to be had for you somewhere I'm sure. But not here. Oh no.Now go. Leave this page go buy the film.Do it now."
62,The Boxtrolls,7,12 February 2015,interesting grotesque vision,"Pest exterminator Archibald Snatcher spreads rumors of evil Boxtrolls in the town of Cheesebridge. He tells the mayor Lord Portley-Rind that they'll even come after his cheese which is all he cares about. He strikes a bargain with the mayor to exterminate every Boxtroll for a White Hat which gives him membership to the city's cheese-loving council. The Boxtrolls are actually peaceful scavengers and they raised baby Eggs as one of their own. He's in an Eggs box living in their underground world eating bugs, collecting junk during the night and hiding from their tormentors. The mayor ignores his daughter Winnie in favor of his White Hat. She befriends Eggs and discovers the true nature of the Boxtrolls.It's the same company that made ParaNorman and Coraline. They made a stop-motion animation world of ugly grotesque visions. It's not really a thing of beauty but it is interesting. What's probably missing is a sense of the Boxtroll characters. They are just a bunch of indistinguishable creatures. It would be so much better if the creatures are individual characters that the audience can understand. At least, an important character like Fish needs to be more unique. I do like the simple story of good versus evil."
63,The Boxtrolls,8,26 January 2015,"Funny, smart... and entertaining.","My Grandkids loved it. I loved it. Ghoulish, horrible and witty.The voice acting was top class, the script was sharp... and the animation was superb. My fellow viewers were the children of the same kids I took to see Toy Story years ago. It was different to that... but no less imaginative, and just as funny.My only complaint, is that it was only about 10 times better a film... than most of the 'Oscar' hopefuls this year... yet because it is an 'animation'... it gets disregarded.I would rather watch three seconds of this, than 'Birdman' or 'Boyhood' in their entirety."
64,The Boxtrolls,4,28 September 2014,Worst Animated Movie I've Ever Seen.,"The reason this is not going to be a hit nor a franchise is because the target audience just is not going to get it, not going to care, and not going to show up. It seems like the story was maybe geared towards a teen audience, and teens are going to smell this stinker from a mile away.The animation was quite good. The visuals too. The story - hooo - was just way too bizarre. It was the most ridiculous story for a kid movie I've ever seen. 20 or 30 minutes into the movie I still could not tell what it was about - Partly because the voices were so hard to understand that I felt like it needed subtitles -- Even for the main 'people' characters. When it takes that long to begin to understand what is going on, I'm already not interested. By the time I could catch up and get used to the weird voices, it didn't matter, because this was a completely weird snoozefest for me, and I wish I had not wasted my time on it. I'm a 40ish-year-old man, I took my 35ish-year-old sister and my 8-year-old niece. All of us are pretty intelligent. We all left the theater scratching our heads, wondering what we just saw.This is going to be gone and forgotten before anybody even misses it. Just too weird for most kids' taste -- and adults, too."
65,The Boxtrolls,6,4 January 2015,Rather Disappointing,"A young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator. Based on the children's novel 'Here Be Monsters' by Alan Snow.This film, as of now (January 2015) is anticipated to be one of the nominees for a ""best animation"" Oscar. While it clearly will not win, it also should not be nominated. Despite some decent animation, the plot is not very interesting and the characters are not incredibly memorable. The girl (voiced by Elle Fanning) is downright annoying. After the studio's impressive ""ParaNorman"", this is a disappointing follow-up.The cheese theme was excellent, and worthy of a Primus song (were they consulted?)... but that was about it. The voice talents of Ben Kingsley, Nick Frost and Simon Pegg were utterly wasted."
66,The Boxtrolls,6,3 October 2014,A beautifully designed miss,"Back when I was a little kid growing up with my VHS player, the forever classic Wallace and Gromit series instilled in me a love for stop-motion animation that would last a lifetime. Thus, every time a new film comes out that is done entirely via the tediously spectacular art of stop-motion I get really excited. When I saw the trailer for The Boxtrolls, a film from the makers of Coraline and ParaNorman, I was psyched. This one was made out to be one of the most fantastical, exciting, and magical stop motion movies to come out in years.What The Boxtrolls actually ends up being is a fun little adventure movie that's good for some lightweight entertainment, but never really takes you to that magical place that a movie like Coraline can take you. Now, I've only seen some of Coraline and none of ParaNorman because I'm an awful person, but I still had certain expectations for The Boxtrolls that the movie ended up falling just short of. The Boxtrolls certainly has the stunning visuals of the aforementioned films, and it creates a beautifully illustrated world full of cooky caricatures and exquisitely detailed sets. To think that it was all done by hand is truly mind-blowing and no matter how good or bad one of these films is, you have to give so much credit to the insanely dedicated crew who put this together.What left me feeling a little disappointed after The Boxtrolls was its story, and how it fails to take you on a truly imaginative journey. The movie is about a race of creatures called Boxtrolls that live in the sewers of the city of Cheesebridge. With them lives Eggs, a boy who was taken by the Boxtrolls as an infant and has grown up thinking he is one of the creatures. When the Boxtrolls begin to be hunted by the townspeople who think they are evil and malicious baby-stealing creatures, Eggs heads up to the surface world to save his Boxtroll friends, but along the way he learns some startling secrets about his past.The Boxtrolls is a very simple story told in a very simple way. There's nothing particularly exceptional about the tale that unfolds here. It's basic, stream-lined, moralistic, and predictable. These are of course the opportune adjectives to describe most kids movies, and that's what The Boxtrolls feels like. You have a very clear hero and villain, with other archetypal characters thrown into the mix that all fit their archetypal roles. There's not a whole lot of creativity in the storytelling, and the film mostly relies on its brilliant sets and the film's titular creatures, the squeaky and lovable boxtrolls.Speaking on the critters, though, I thought the film could have benefited a lot from some backstory to these creatures and their world. Who or what are boxtrolls? Where did they come from? What do they want? The same can almost be said for the human characters as well. Nobody is too fleshed out in this film, and we only love or hate certain characters because the movie tells us to through the exaggerated maliciousness of the villain and the uncompromised cuteness of the boxtrolls and their human children protagonist friends. A kiddy story laced with kiddy humor makes The Boxtrolls a film that you can appreciate for the technical aspect, but you will find very difficult to fall in love with. There's plenty to enjoy, and I left with genuine laughs and a mostly satisfied smile on my face, but I think I will forget all about The Boxtrolls a few years down the road."
67,The Boxtrolls,7,16 September 2014,"Good Efforts from Laika as Usual, but a bit Unappealing","Laika has been well known of their artistic talent to bring back the old-time style of making an animation by creating different emotions of the characters through small figurines and hand movements in a designed board, but unfortunately and surprisingly that the concept and screenplay for this third repeating effort seems to be a little bit underwhelming. While ParaNorman looks much more fun, interesting and appealing to general audiences, though boxtrolls themselves are adorable enough to attract the kids, they are dull and the slow progressing of the first half of the film might bored the parents. However, the strong casts who voice all the characters in the film especially Ben Kingsley as the villain though looks hilarious, but great enough to make the second half the film, at least to look more attracting, bringing on an inspiring message to remind audiences to be the real of yourself."
68,The Boxtrolls,7,13 September 2014,This cheese-obsessed and boxtroll-fearing movie is not that simple and parental guidance is necessary.,"The Boxtrolls (2014) is creative and baroque-styled. However, this cheese- obsessed and boxtroll-fearing movie is not that simple and parental guidance is necessary. I am not sure if this film is truly aimed for children but parents might not be happy when they watch this with their young children. I thought some of the hilarious scenes may not be appropriate and some are quite horrifying. The intensity just increase as the movie progresses. For me, I won't get nightmares or anything like that, but not sure if it'll be the same for young children! True that there are some funny moments but that's not enough to make up with the flaws in this movie. So, I am sorry to say this, I know there's several themes in this film such as we shouldn't live hiding and the effects of selfishness; skillful claymation but the screenplay...maybe not really intended for children? (But the film as a whole looks like intended for children as well.) I am quite confused myself when I watch this but people in the general shouldn't miss this one if they really want to watch a great stop motion film as The Boxtrolls (2014) is beautiful and it does have considerable amount of moral values and life lessons.Okay, enough with minor viewers issue, The Boxtrolls (2014) is actually pretty interesting. It is amazing that everything are made from scratch and the monsters they say in this film are actually creatures with a knack at invention. There are several things to ponder about and in the end, this film is able to give the us the viewers some food for thought on how societies should actually work!"
69,The Boxtrolls,8,3 January 2016,"A Fun, Well Animated and Whimsical Story,","The Bxtrolls is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific voice cast. It's a very fun story that is original in a way that I feel will appeal to both children and adults, as we follow a young boy struggling the make his town realise that Boxtrolls, a group of monsters that rared him, are not evil and mean no harm. The animation also helps with the originality of the film, it looks absolutely stunning, and you can tell a lot of work went in to making it, clay animation is very rarely used these days so I always appreciated it when it is. It bothered me how little the Boxtrolls were actually in it, for the fact that they're the title characters and the story revolves around them, the villain is practically the main character, which I felt was a mistake, especially when it's a very unlikeable one who isn't really powerful enough to hold the whole movie. The films voice cast is outstanding, they are all well known names but it dosen't feel like they did this animated film just for a pay check, it felt like they genuinely liked the script and wanted to do justice with their voice work, and they did, a lot of them sounded very different, I was particularly impressed with Ben Kingsley and Simon Pegg, who you can tell put loads of energy in to their performances. Stunning animation, outstanding voice cast and a very nice story, I would recommend the Boxtrolls to anyone looking for a good family film. A young boy who was raised by monsters known as Boxtrolls must save them from being taken and killed by an evil exterminator hoping to gain power."
70,The Boxtrolls,7,19 February 2015,Another stop-motion treat from Laika,"From the twisted imagination of Laika comes another stop-motion animated film that is sure to visually astound, but is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to the story. Basically, it's about these underground-dwelling creatures that the townsfolk of Cheesebridge think are vicious monsters, thanks to a baby being taken several years before. However, things aren't quite what they seem as the Boxtrolls have a thriving society of their own and aren't quite the monsters the townspeople have been led to believe. It should go without saying that the film is visually inventive and downright impressive to watch when you consider that this was done with stop-motion animation. CORALINE, also from Laika, was one of my favorite animated films in the year it came out and THE BOXTROLLS is just as good in that respect. It also has an outstanding voice cast, although I only recognized two of them while watching. They were Ben Kingsley as Archibald Snatcher, and Jared Harris as Lord Portly-Rind. Lord Portly-Rind is the leader of Cheesebridge, and the one who authorizes Snatcher to capture and kill all of the Boxtrolls. I must say that Ben Kingsley does a very good villain, although the substance of the character isn't unlike villains I've seen in other children's films. The visual design actually reminded me a bit of the Child Catcher from CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, and the resemblance was probably intentional.Where I think the film falters a little is in the story which manages to tackle some deep themes, yet is completely typical and unsubtle in its approach to them. The ending was also a little more protracted than it probably needed to be. Still, there are some good things that shouldn't go over children's heads that you can talk about with them afterwards. The biggest theme is about how we shouldn't let ""things"" define who we are. The people, especially the ""White Hats,"" in Cheesebridge are all about their cheese, and initially the Boxtrolls are defined by the box that they all wear. I think the film effectively shows that we shouldn't allow material possessions, power, or the quest for either of them, to affect who we are as people. Another theme explored is that of not fearing what we don't understand, like the people in Cheesebridge fear the Boxtrolls. One thing I didn't expect, however, was how funny this would actually be. Even though this is geared towards children, there is meta-humor and winks to the audience that parents will probably enjoy as well. Overall while the story does kind of hit you over the head with its message, and is probably a little too macabre and grotesque for young children, THE BOXTROLLS is a refreshing reminder that imagination still exists in the world of animation."
71,The Boxtrolls,8,3 February 2015,"Everything I loved in an animated kids' film, growing up as a child!","'THE BOXTROLLS': Four Stars (Out of Five)A stop motion animated kids' film based on the 2005 fantasy children's novel 'Here Be Monsters!', by Alan Snow. The movie was written by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava and directed by Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi. It was produced by Laika, a Portland based stop animation studio (run by chairman Phil Knight and his son, animator Travis Knight); Laika is also responsible for such other dark kids' flicks as 'CORALINE' and 'PARANORMAN'. The movie tells the story of a human boy, raised by trash collecting monsters; that are threatened by an evil exterminator. It features the voice talents of Isaac Hempstead- Wright, Ben Kingsley, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Tonie Collette, Richard Ayoade, Tracy Morgan, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. It was nominated for an Academy Award, for Best Animated Feature, and it's my favorite of the nominated films (since 'THE LEGO MOVIE' was snubbed).The story is set in the fictional town of Cheesebridge; located in Britain, during the late 1800s. A community of peaceful trolls (called Boxtrolls), which gather trash for building useful objects, have been incorrectly labeled evil monsters; which capture and kill little kids. When the Boxtrolls come across an orphan human boy, named Eggs (Hempstead-Wright), they raise him as their own. As the boy grows up with the monsters, he witnesses many of them being killed off by a villainous exterminator, named Archibald Snatcher (Kingsley). Snatcher wants to exterminate all of the troll creatures; in order to gain acceptance by the town's social elite. Eggs teams with the mayor's daughter, Winnie (Fanning), in order to stop him.I really like the entire look and feel of the movie; it's dark, crude and grotesque (like everything I loved in an animated kids' film, growing up as a child). I love the animation, music and voices; of the creatures and human characters alike. This is a kids' movie with personality, character and originality; everything a lot of popular dumbed-down kids' films are missing nowadays. I was surprised to first hear it had been nominated for a Best Animated Feature award (at the Oscars and Golden Globes) but after seeing it I definitely understand why. It deserves all of the praise it's been getting and it's one of the best 2014 animated movies I've seen!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/D17O2xOoOCw"
72,The Boxtrolls,10,4 February 2015,Cheese,"A well deserved Oscar nomination goes to this movie.After waiting all through the summer The Boxtrolls had finally been released.This is the story about the Boxtrolls that is monsters living in the caves underneath a city build on a hill.The city looks just like Montmatre.It's like the end of the 1900's Montmatre.A boy lives with the Boxtrolls, and they are hunted by the humans.It all ends with a fight against a huge machine that captures the Boxtrolls.As if it isn't enough the villain explodes at the end.If you love charming and thrilling movies like Coraline go watch this.10/10"
73,The Boxtrolls,6,15 January 2015,"Excellent animation, but forgettable","Personally despite the top notch stop motion animation, I just wasn't really digging this movie all that much. It's a really British family animation movie that just didn't bring anything exciting or new. Sure, the movie is based on a book but from the perspective of someone that never read the book. This one just came off a bit bland. However what kept me watching was the really smoothly rendered stop motion animation. So I give this one a 6.4/10 because I did like the message near the end and how everything comes together. And because of the level when it comes to the animation. It just lacked the elements that would make it enticing to the viewers. It just falls short of what it tries to accomplish. The plot is set in a world where the success is measured by what hat you wear and if your successful enough to eat cheese with a group of snobbish men. So it does get weird at times. And some parts felt like it was dragging and seemed a bit sluggish at times. Some audiences might be put off by the slight weirdness of the characters and direction, but I at least liked that element.6.4/10"
74,The Boxtrolls,7,29 December 2014,Charming,"There weren't too many good English animation movies this year. The Lego Movie made an impression on me on a more philosophical way and I fairly enjoyed How to Train Your Dragon 2, but I think that's it. So when I heard Laika Entertainment (Corpse Bride, Coraline and ParaNorman) made a new production, it immediately got my attention. Not because Laika guarantees to bring us quality, but because I like their stop-motion approach. Over all I prefer it more than CGI. Although the screenplay of The Boxtrolls isn't that original (and actually the mid-credits scene is the best one of the whole film), it appeals to my inner child a lot. Especially the helpers of Archibald Snatcher (the bad guy) are fantastic. With the familiar voices of Ben Kingsley, Jared Harris, Nick Frost, Richard Ayoade, Tracy Morgan, Elle Fanning, Toni Collette and Simon Pegg, The Boxtrolls pleases audiences of all ages. For more original English spoken animation flicks, I guess I'll check out Cheatin', Rocks in My Pockets and Song of the Sea though."
75,The Boxtrolls,7,15 December 2014,"Dark, well crafted stop motion film","The Boxtrolls is a 3D stop motion animated film from the studio Laika that also made Coraline and Paranorman. The film follows a group of adorable little trolls that clothe themselves with boxes that live underground, but are hunted by the humans living above. An orphaned boy, Eggs, is raised by them and helps bridge the animosity between the two groups. The film looks beautiful (better than Paranorman in my opinion) and the voice cast is excellent. The rich score by Dario Marianelli is one of the best of the year. However, the story and is as generic as they come and is insanely predictable. Also, this film is probably not suitable for children, as the film is very dark."
76,The Boxtrolls,9,13 December 2014,Deserving of a White Hat and an Oscar Nomination,"9.1 of 10. Cartoons so far in 2014 and much of 2013 have been lacking originality or art. Based on a book, this also adds another rarity: intelligently crafted story telling minus any odious narration. The filmmaker's skill seems closely tied to the story, so this far improves upon the Coraline effort.An old-fashioned style cartoon telling a story about the old industrial age where cars are new yet old and dirty all at the same time. It seems to be set in a French city where cheese and madames are appreciated and those wandering the streets past sundown are feared or criminalized. And this is where the boxtrolls come in. They are the spooky night creatures that are blamed for thefts, violence, and disappearances.The film weaves in both simple, easily understood humor for children and more complex satire for adults. As for the trolls, whether naked or in their boxes, they have a cute, amusing quality to them similar to the monsters in Monsters, Inc. or the less fierce dragons in the How to Train Your Dragon films."
77,The Boxtrolls,9,6 December 2014,great movie!,"quite underrated in my opinion. most of my friends didn't even know this movie. lack of promotion in my country i guess. had to be honest, i walked in the cinema with low expectation. the trailer doesn't look like it would be a splendid movie. however, i came out of the cinema feeling really really good somehow. love the story of course. original and fresh, very creative. as for the animation, greatly done. i was always a stop-animation fan and this movie definitely did not disappoint. especially the facial expressions of the characters, grotesque and eccentric and just awesome! as for the cast, BEN KINGSLEY IS JUST OUT OF THIS WORLD. never a fan of Elle Fanning's voice, her constantly-excited voice annoys me."
78,The Boxtrolls,8,5 December 2014,Endearing creatures in narrative w typical Laika spin,"Laika animation company adds to its macabre stop-motion animated film repertoire with a film about orphans and box-icide.The animation studio draws inspiration from the book series Here Be Monsters by Alan Snow to create The Boxtrolls.The boxtrolls are little monsters that dwell in the sewers beneath the posh Victorian city of Cheesebridge, known for its stinky cheeses and wealth obsessed residents. The townspeople know the legend of the boxtrolls as foul little creatures that come up from the depths to steal their precious children. As with any fable, things are not as they appear and illuminating lessons are to be learned by many.I'm a sucker for Laika films and The Boxtrolls had me at its very first teaser trailer released in July of 2013. In this tale, a young orphaned boy finds refuge and a family in the widely misunderstood and maligned box-dwelling trash collectors of the city. When the town exterminator makes it his mission to rid Cheesebridge of all the boxtrolls, the boy must brave the world he's been sheltered from to save his friends.The Boxtrolls follows the standard for having celebrity actors do voice-work for the animated film. Ben Kingsley does his best Michael Caine impression as the cheese-hungry exterminator Archiband Snatcher with Nick Frost, Tracy Morgan and Richard Ayoade as the henchmen. Game of Thrones' Isaac Hempstead Wright is the orphaned boy tasked with saving the lives of the boxtrolls with the help of a girl Winnie, voiced most weakly of the bunch by Elle Fanning.The Boxtrolls has everything a child could want from an animated film. Its original music by Dario Marianelli is whimsical and reminiscent of primo-composer John Williams. It has oddly distinct but cutely endearing creatures who speak in garbled gibberish sounds of gobbledygook. There's a discernible villain with a clear and sinister motive and a simple but satisfying resolve to the film. And of course, plenty of child friendly jokes to keep the kids laughing with several more subtle laughs for adults.As with the previous stop motion films released by Laika, The Boxtrolls is more somber than your typical animated feature film marketed toward children and touches on more adult-like themes. Yet, it fills the needs for both while adhering steadfastly to its creative and distinct vision.For more FULL reviews of ALL the RECENT releases, please check out our website!"
79,The Boxtrolls,9,19 November 2014,Lovely and super fun!,"Such a wonderful, fun, lovely and amazing movie! Not the most original story, but oddly enough, that's not really an issue here because it's got such candor and beauty and such beautiful acting from the characters with such clear motivations all throughout, that rather quickly it becomes just a real joy to tag along for the ride. It's definitely one of those films with its heart on the right place. The art was astounding on every level as well, the animation is amongst the best I've seen in a while and even the concept art shown in the end credits is gorgeous! Do stay to watch the whole thing if you can just to enjoy the beautiful artwork. A 9 year old kid watching the movie in the row behind me stood up and said: ""MOM! The art in the credits is drawn even better than the movie itself!"" he he.. (He'll understand the difference between drawing and stop motion eventually, I guess... such a keen eye this kid!) And yeah, it is aimed more at kids than adults, but, wow, did it take me back to feeling like a kid again! I cannot wait to see it again on a theater later during the week. Pure old-fashioned fun this is!"
80,The Boxtrolls,8,19 October 2014,The Boxtrolls is as memorable for children as it's entertaining for adults.,"The Boxtrolls is another must-see release in Laika's solid filmography. Over the past several years the studio has gone through lay-offs and departures, worked on commercials, and is now focusing exclusively on feature film production. I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to seeing this film because the trailer and the story didn't impress me as much as Coraline (2009) and ParaNorman (2012). But I decided to give it a go. The Boxtrolls turned out to be an enjoyable family-oriented comedy. It's not quite as good as Coraline but it's easily one of the best animated films of this year. There's a certain charm to stop-motion animation. Russian animator Ladislav Starevich is the pioneer in this field, and his work has inspired animators and special-effects technicians. The Cameraman's Revenge (1911) is one of Starevich's most well-known films. I also recommend seeing Cheburashka (1971) by Roman Kachanov. The reason why I like The Boxtrolls is its characters. Sure, the style here is as visually inspired and fanciful as anything that Laika has put out. But it's the distinct and memorable characters that make this film such a treat. Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) is the villain, but he's a product of poverty. Because of her father's preoccupation with wealth, Winnie Portley-Rind (Elle Fanning) is rebellious. Eggs (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) is a boy who has to deal with difficult truths once he meets Winnie. The boxtrolls themselves are gentle creatures but they're far less interesting than the human characters. Because the film is based on Alan Snow's novel Here Be Monsters! it has the themes of social injustice and economic disparity, which make little impact because they're delivered haphazardly. Still, the film manages to correct itself because it shows what complacency can lead to. Complacency runs strong with the townsfolk, the boxtrolls and Snatcher's henchmen. At a time when the animation market is dominated by Walt Disney Studios, Pixar and Japanese anime, a stop motion effort like The Boxtrolls is a breath of fresh air. It succeeds uniquely because of its European, and especially Russian, influences. It also delivers action and adventure to appeal to a large audience. Most importantly, it makes a statement without losing its sense of humor and whimsy along the way, which is a sign of respect for the young audience. I recommend The Boxtrolls."
81,The Boxtrolls,7,18 October 2014,Beautiful Visuals but Lacks Core,"I'm really sad to say it but Boxtrolls has to go into my flawed gem box. Don't get me wrong, it is a gem. The animation is impeccable. Multiple times over the film I had to remind myself that what I saw was stop-motion, an actual, physical model was photographed frame by painstaking frame to create the incredibly fluid movement taking place in front of my eyes. There's lot of visual design and details hidden on characters and in the environment and it's a delight to see characters move and interact. Past the visuals the dialogue is solid. Characters are interesting and I definitely had a couple deep belly laughs as the villain's henchmen wax poetic over them being the good guys. The trouble with the film is there is just too much to do and not enough time to get it done. We have the universe to set up and many characters to meet and flesh out. It doesn't feel like we spent enough time connecting with the characters before the climax hit and that was a bummer. On top of this the theme/lesson of the movie seems muddled. Laika's last film ParaNorman was perfect on both of these fronts connecting you to the party of characters and weaving it's theme into the main actions of the hero. That's why it's sad seeing it lacking here and it certainly feels like there should be more. I'm not sure if they just didn't have the time to fit all the content in or the film was rushed for a release date but motivations and set-ups aren't there for most characters and this makes the ending loose some of it's punch. I'd still say people should head out and see it just lower your expectations a little."
82,The Boxtrolls,6,13 October 2014,"Nice moral lessons for children, but it looks kind of creepy in a way","The town of Cheesebridge has a community of creatures living in caverns underneath them. The creatures are boxtrolls, little trolls with cardboard boxes as clothes, collecting trash to build new things from it. They generally avoid the humans, thus the people, never really seeing them; consider them to be a myth. Archibald Snatcher tells the people that the boxtrolls are nasty and eats people. Trying to get into the town's elite cheese taster group of white hats, Archibald Snatcher ignores his lactose intolerance problem and convinces the group's leader Lord Portley-Rind to award him a white hat if he can eliminate every boxtroll in the town. Eggs is a boy who was raised by the boxtrolls thus believing he's a boxtroll too. One day when going up-ground with the boxtrolls, he meets Lord Portley-Rind's daughter Winnie, who is disenchanted by her father for caring more about the cheese than about her. Snatcher starts hunting the boxtrolls one by one. At first Eggs obeys his closest boxtroll friend Fish to stand down and hide. The next time Eggs and Winnie meets, Eggs accidentally takes Winnie underground to the boxtrolls' caverns, where she sees their kind nature. She and Eggs then go back up-ground to tell the truth of boxtrolls to Lord Portley-Rind. They manage to do so but Lord Portley-Rind seems to care more about the cheese they drowned on their way. Snatcher captures all the boxtrolls and forces them to build a big machine. He also catches Eggs and puts him beside an old inventor who turns out to be his father. After that he puts the boxtrolls together under a crusher. Eggs talk to the boxtrolls to leave the boxes and escape but they don't seem to listen, and the boxes got crushed. With the big machine Snatcher brings Eggs, dressed as the last boxtroll, to be killed in front of the townsfolk as he receives his white hat. He specifically wants Lord Portley-Rind's hat. The boxtrolls, out of their boxes, come in time and save Eggs from death. They then try to dismantle the big machine, but they find it difficult. Winnie lures Snatcher with her father's hat. After some time, they all let Snatcher have the hat and the machine is torn apart. They all grants Snatcher's wish to taste the best cheese. His body can't cope with it and Snatcher exploded.The movie tries to serve the classic requirements that a children's movie has to have. It has the kid main character with timid initial personality, which children relate more to. It has the spirited sidekick who encourages the main character when he's unsure of what he can do. The cause to fight for is to save the main character's friends, which tells deep moral values about loyalty, sacrifice and courage. An it has the necessary villain, with the somewhat ludicrous selfish cause of his.Yet the final product result seems to be so dark for children consumption. Maybe it's aiming at the release date's void of animation movie, but the move on making the movie mostly dark results in the movie seem a bit creepy, especially for children perspective. Add to that the weirdly deformed character design and the quite graphic imagery of the villain's deeds and death, the creepy verdict gets even sharper.The technicalities feel just adequate for this movie. The stop-motion animation looks nicely handled. The voice acting is a great overall job. Ben Kingsley's Archibald Snatcher can snatch the need for the character's hyperbolic speaking and gesturing. Jared Harris provides the great irony and disappointment of Poertly-Rind caring more about cheese than the boxtrolls. Elle Fanning did just enough to make Winnie's one word grunts sound nice.A 6 out of 10 score is from me for The Boxtrolls (2014). A recommendation is only for those of you who'd take yours kids to see another dedicated movie for them after the shortage of recommendable animation movies these recent few weeks after Planes: Fire and Rescue."
83,The Boxtrolls,10,4 October 2014,One of the funniest family films you can see (Recommended by me),"I went to see this film at cine-world cinemas in Leigh and I can honestly say, it is one of the funniest films that I have ever seen!! I like how Eggs thought that he was a box troll and I liked when he found out that he was the missing baby. I enjoyed it when he found out that his dad was alive and that his dad had gone absolutely cuckoo because he had been hanging upside down and the blood had gone right to his head!!! I also enjoyed when the box trolls hid, they could just go into their boxes and not be seen, but for some reason the box-troll exterminators could notice them even when they the box-trolls were hidden in their boxes. I thought it was funny that when Snatcher ate cheese, he swelled up like a balloon!!"
84,The Boxtrolls,8,29 September 2014,Another captivating mix of stop-motion and CG animation from Laika,"First and foremost, don't judge a film by its appearance. Don't let the creepy designs of the boxtrolls discourage you from watching this film. The film may look like it has a darker and gloomy tone to it but don't let it deceive you.For those who haven't seen the past two Laika productions, Coraline (2009) and ParaNorman (2012), it might take you quite a while to get used to the character designs and styles shown in the film. However, despite its weird and unappealing nature, The Boxtrolls is actually a surprisingly fun, charming, heartwarming adventure for people of all ages.The Boxtrolls is a captivating mix of stop-motion and CG (computer graphics) animation that has a distinctive look that stands out from many of the recently released animations out there. We're living in an age where most animation studios have opted to use CG for their main releases, it's quite rare nowadays to find companies willing to go through the painstaking effort and a great amount of time to slowly move clay figures bit by bit, in very small movements each time to make a film.Just try to let yourself be submerged in the world before judging it. I believe you'll find it fascinating soon enough. If you pay attention to the film, you'll notice the intense detailing that the animators put into the film. Despite their 'ugliness', the Boxtrolls are actually harmless, shy, good-natured, intelligent and adorable little creatures that roam the streets at night to look for junks to repair or create something new out of them. They fear the humans as much as the humans fear them.Although the plot is rather straightforward, the film contains some rather complex, mature themes (by children's standards of course). Thankfully, they're expressed in a subtle manner throughout the story instead of becoming hard hitting moral lessons to be learned by the end of the film. Basically, the film tries to encourage children to be independent and stand up on their feet in a world full of adults. It teaches kids that sometimes things are just not what it seems on the outside. We should not judge a book by its cover or lose sight of what's right and wrong. Moreover, the film also shows that sometimes the life we always wanted is not really the life we truly need. Overall, The Boxtrolls is great. It's one of the best animated films of the year. It has a unique and refreshing look that's different compared with many other animation out there. Just give it a chance.Rating: 8/10Note: Please wait for the mid-credit scene. Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles will have something to say about the nature of the world around them.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/09/movie-review-boxtrolls.html"
85,The Boxtrolls,9,28 September 2014,The Boxtrolls have invaded my heart in beautiful old-fashioned stop motion.,"There's no greater fear of what you don't see as opposed to something that could be seen like birds or spiders. This is especially evident in childhood where anything could be real. Without a full understanding of the way the world works, it was possible to look away and imagine a creature of unspeakable nature, sneaking in a quiet whoosh as it plots to eat you or steal your shoes. What get's most children in this mindset that it could be anything that's out to get them; a goblin, witches, monsters, or even the things that you would never suspect as evident.For something like The Boxtrolls to take empty boxes and make it into something that people would fear, I seriously have to give it a ton of points for creativity. Connecting this to something like Toy Story or The Brave Little Toaster takes it all back to the notion that every object has a purpose. The purpose of a box is to contain anything and ensure that it remains safe from outside forces. The monsters here not only use cardboard boxes to hide from humans, but wear them as their clothes, so placing themselves in the real world would be easy, and give them a reason for people to fear them.The Boxtrolls is the latest stop motion animation film from the Oregon based studio, Laika, the same people behind Coraline and ParaNorman. I had enjoyed the previous films and I knew I was in for a fun experience, all exposed in beautiful hand crafted imagery that we don't see enough off.The story brings us to the town of Cheesebridge, where little Boxtrolls come out at night to take things from the garbage and look for food. Common prejudices have developed the idea that the creatures steel children and eat them after an incident where a little boy was taken. To ensure safety, Archibald Snatcher (played by Ben Kingsley) offers to exterminate them all in exchange for future membership in a white hat club where the finest cheese tasters dine.What people don't understand is that the boy taken, now age ten with the name Eggs, was rescued and knows that the creatures would never hurt a fly. More trolls get taken in the night, even Eggs' closest friend Fish. He receives help from a girl Winnie (played by Elle Fanning) who's curious about monsters. She gives him the proper gentlemen education and calls that he present his case to her father who could save the creatures.In the middle of a pool of animated movies that chose to look as realistic as possible, it's still nice to know that movies like The Boxtrolls exist. The old fashioned look allows it's creative world to come alive, looking even better then the computer animation that dominates the industry. I have a feeling that kids like to be scared and will be sucked into this place, as they did with Coraline and ParaNorman.I can't go as far to say that The Boxtrolls is Laika's best work. It takes plenty of time establishing it's world before getting into a story that typically moves the movie forward. It's not a bad thing, but a few minutes trimmed wouldn't have been a bad idea. The main boy Eggs, while not a bad character, he's a typical feral child, feels a tad bland compared the quirky characters we've seen in Laika's other work. The other characters have their moments with Winnie being somewhat of a tomboy but knowing how to be a lady and her father being the pompous aristocrat that needs to make an image of himself. The Boxtrolls themselves remind me of the Gremlins from the 1980's, with their playful attitude as the scurry within the shadows. Archibald Snatcher is my favorite, being deliciously evil with a voice like Ben Kinsley's that makes him so.I'll give this nine Boxtrolls out of ten. Seeing companies like Laika make me glad that there are people out there looking to make a difference in how animation can be viewed. I would see The Boxtrolls again, just to give this company leverage to continue making movies."
86,The Boxtrolls,8,27 September 2014,"Fun and creepy, maybe a little too icky on the big screen","I'm a stop motion fanatic and see them all, sometimes twice! So I know what's out there and what's state of the art. This film is extremely well crafted. Maybe not quite at the smooth level of Aardman but pretty close. It's a fun story with some great laughs and the voice acting is pitch perfect. As has been mentioned there's a lot of Dahl darkness to this story.The cons, the flesh tones and slimy bad teeth faces are just a little too ick on the big screen at 10 feet high. I caught myself thinking the unintentional gross factor was just a little too much a few times. I don't agree with other reviewers that think the movie is a little too scary, it's really not scary at all but there are scenes that exude sliminess and after awhile it can feel like you've got it on you.I suspect that the sliminess factor will go down quite a bit if watched on the small screen and overall it's a very fun movie that as a rarity actually gets better in the third act instead of falling apart.So if you aren't a stop motion fan but just want a kids movie to go to is this worth the price of a ticket? Yes I think so. Recommended."
87,The Boxtrolls,6,6 January 2015,"Unremarkable due to a formulaic story, but great stop motion.","If anything, you have to appreciate the craft. Laika offers detail like none other here in The Boxtrolls with some of the smoothest and most ambitious moves and sets I've seen in a stop motion film. It's a shame that they don't put as much effort into the story department. There's nothing wrong with it, in fact it hits every beat as you expect in the formula. But that's the problem. It's so nondescript and safe, even in its portrayal of the grotesque, that it has no impact to offer. Kids will eat it up, but its lack of subversion in its characters or story beats hold it back through any other perspective giving us little reason to invest besides vulnerabilities. Granted, it's better than the acclaimed Coraline, which I'm still half-way through and half- interested in. At least Nick Frost and Richard Ayoade's self-aware henchmen are amusing, but they're not necessarily original either. The Boxtrolls is simply a solid and unremarkable film that just washes past you.6/10"
88,The Boxtrolls,,16 December 2014,Nice craftsmanship,"I'm primarily interested in the air and sculpting of things, cinematic or otherwise, to have presence, which means I'm not a big fan of animation and never will be. This is interesting for me, for the way it has been sculpted above all, unlike mass-produced Disney it gives me the feel of a craftsman in his workshop doing more personal work. The titular creatures' occupation reveals as much; tinkering with things for the joy of seeing them work and move. This is what these guys did, tinkered with the feel and contours of the animated world. It reminded me of those handcarved animations the Czechs were doing in a previous life, the imaginary city points to central Europe anyhow; the lovely Krysar might have been an inspiration, seek it out.In another level this simple approach means these guys haven't yet perfected their storytelling, it's not as snappy as Disney or Pixar who over dozens of films have perfected their formulas to a tee. And something about little innocent critters trembling in their boxes tells me they'd like to grow in that direction, it's as if I could sense that a more cantankerous imagination in some earlier draft was airbrushed in the name of family appeal.It is the same blueprint of dual worlds they used in their previous films, here above is the world of adult greed and ambition, below the world of fraternity and collective work. In Coraline the imaginative world 'below' was threatening, here completely benign.A pretty fascinating image closes this, where two of the characters ponder on what gods make their strange universe move while slowly the puppeteer emerges in fast forward who is propping them up, giving soul."
89,The Boxtrolls,6,3 December 2014,Ugly can be beautiful,"Many people say that animation movies are for children and not for grownups. This movie is one more that denies this. Animation movies have the visual effects and the images that can be charming, besides the story and very much appreciated by adults. The story in this movie is not very strong or original but the images, visual effects and the several characters impersonation and expressions are superb. Most characters are rather ugly but this is aesthetically very impressive and we can almost say beautiful. And the monsters are morally the good ones the evil one being a human being. And maybe the best part of the film in terms of images, voices and music are the scenes that go on with the full cast and crew credits in the end."
90,The Boxtrolls,6,14 November 2014,A touch of Jungle Book,"""The Boxtrolls"" is one of the better 2014 animated movies and it is based on the children's book ""Here Be Monsters!"". The directors and writers behind the film have worked on television, short films, video games etc. before, but a full feature movie is somehow new territory for them, so it would be a huge success if they can get it to be Oscar-nominated in the animated film category.I believe this is a film for all age groups. The abduction early on looked kinda evil without knowing the background yet at this point, but there is nothing really dark or sinister in this film that should keep you from bringing your little ones. I needed a while to become sympathetic with the Boxtrolls actually and maybe that is why the way the central box troll brought up the little boy left me fairly detached emotionally. And even if it has the USA listed as its country, I felt this was a very British movie. The humor is British and all the characters are. The main character's love interest (if you could even call her that) is not a beautiful princess by any means, but a random British girl with rough edges and flaws. The animation is solid. Occasionally, i quite liked, but all in all it did not entirely blew me away. The cheese allergy is displayed in a very unique way. Truly disgusting as it was intended as it was the perfect symbolization of greed here and never having enough. Aas a whole, the animation is very much like what you would expect an animated period piece to look like.My favorite scenes include the following: the one at the villain's headquarters where the boy tries to free his mentor. Tense in terms of story and the main characters efforts and nicely displayed. The Boxtroll genocide scene later on was quite heavy even if things turned out well finally. Quite a shocking moment. The scene where the evil Snatcher performs the Boxtrolls song as a French chanteuse was pretty memorable as well. BOXTROOOOOLLLLLLS! Another idea I liked a lot was the way they created the main antagonist's henchmen. One of them was really completely stupid and evil, the other two, especially the large one, was much smarter than his boss, but just completely misguided till his change of mind near the end. He's possibly my favorite character from the whole film. His scenes were all gold.You could probably look for deeper morals about greed, panic-mongering, friendship, fatherhood (although I felt the plot with his dad really did not add anything to the story and it was just awkward when he reappeared) or belonging in general in this movie and write a whole book about each, but even if you just take it as an entertaining children's movie without deep symbolisms, you can enjoy it for what it is: quality filmmaking. I cannot really say much about the quality of the voice actors as I watched a German dub, but I am sure Ben Kingsley (and the others) did a fine job as usual."
91,The Boxtrolls,7,26 October 2014,Gross. . .,"There is a brief moment following the credits at the end of ""The Boxtrolls"" that shows a couple characters in action, while also showing those characters being created by the incredibly talented clay artists. This is a movie made using stop motion technology: a technique that takes hundreds of thousands of modeled photographs and runs them together to create the visualization of movement. Each photograph has to be delicately set up by human hands, and for this specific film, it is done with handmade clay figures. The precision and attention to detail that goes into making these films is of itself incredible, and I loved that after credits sequence where we were allowed to see that in action.""The Boxtrolls"" is a story is about a bunch of fantastical creatures wearing cardboard boxes who live under the streets of a fictional British city during the Steam Punk era. Every night, they come out of the sewers and scavenge the streets for objects, trinkets, machinery, and anything that sparks their curiosity. This specific story is about a human boy, named Eggs, who has been raised by the Boxtrolls. A fat and gangly villain is trying his best to eliminate every last Boxtroll from the city, and through the Boxtrolls' attempt to survive, Eggs begins to discover who he really is. Isaac Hempstead Wright voices the lead role of Eggs, along with Elle Fanning in the second lead of Winnie. The main Boxtrolls were voiced by Dee Bradley Baker and Steve Blum, who did an entertaining job with their grunts and growls, though it was very difficult to not compare the Boxtroll characters to that of the ever so popular Minions from the two ""Despicable Me"" films. Ben Kingsley took on the role of Snatcher, the evil villain. Kingsley's work here was honestly my favorite part of the film. He found the character he wanted to play, however exaggerated, and he played it with commitment. It wasn't until the credits rolled that I finally realized what part he had played. In my opinion, when an actor has done their best job is when the viewer is completely unaware what role they were in. This is especially outstanding when that actor has become a celebrity, which unfortunately happens quite often in the film industry. Kingsley disguised himself in that way here, which added a much needed depth to the film.As outstanding as the precision and attention to detail is when working with ""clay-mation,"" some part of it has just always put me off. There is clearly an audience for it, but I know that I'm not a member. I find that it's extremely difficult to prevent stop- motion filmmaking from looking just plain gross. Wes Anderson's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is one of my absolute favorite films and it uses this style of animation. However, when I watch that movie I find myself loving the story and the surprising depth of the characters and forgetting about what they look on the outside. I have yet to see a clay-mation film that does the same for me, because this one certainly did not.Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi headed up the storytelling, visualization, and overall mood of the film as the directors. I remember reading part of an interview with those two about making this film and in it they went on and on about how difficult it was for them to get everything to click in the right place, and how great it was once they finally achieved that. After watching the film, I don't understand how they found the latter part to be true. Practically every moment of this film was entirely unpleasant for me  to look at, to listen to, and to overall just be thrown into that world. Had some serious depth and reason to love the characters been introduced, the movie could have been something to get into. It would have been easy, they were working with tiny creatures that wear cardboard boxes like turtle shells, but in the end they just left them empty.It wouldn't surprise me if I went out on the street and found someone who said that ""The Boxtrolls"" was one of their favorite movies. It had parts that could have been funny or clever  I did particularly enjoy the whole dilemma of ""who's the good guy?"" the main villain's henchmen faced during the movie  but because of the way things looked and felt, I just had a hard time enjoying myself while I watched it. So as I walked out of the theater, I was hoping my headache would go away before I sat down to write this review. I give ""The Boxtrolls"" a 6.6/10."
92,The Boxtrolls,6,26 September 2014,Looks Good But Weak Story,"I saw ""The Boxtrolls"", starring the voices of Isaac Hempstead Wright- Game of Thrones_tv, The Awakening; Elle Fanning-Maleficent, We Bought a Zoo; Tracy Morgan-30 Rock_tv, Death at a Funeral and Ben Kingsley-Iron Man 3, The Love Guru.This is a stop-motion animated movie that is based on a children's book that was written by Alan Snow called, Here Be Monsters. It's from the same studios that did Coraline and Paranorman and looks very good. The story could have been a little better, it was a little weak. The boxtrolls are shy, harmless creatures that live underground and come to the surface at night to scrounge for things that they take back to their homes and fix. They get their name from the cardboard boxes that they wear and duck into, for protection-kind of like a turtle. Isaac plays a human boy that is adopted by the boxtrolls after an incident involving some bad humans. Ben plays a human that stirs up hatred towards the boxtrolls by convincing people that the boxtrolls hunt and eat people- Ben earns a living by hunting and capturing boxtrolls. Elle plays a young girl that meets Isaac, thinking he was kidnapped by the boxtrolls and Tracy plays one of Ben's henchmen that really enjoys hunting boxtrolls. They are showing the movie in 3D, which is how I saw it, but it was not really worth the effort; 2D is just fine. During the end credits is a song called The Boxtrolls Song that is written by Eric Idle-nudge, nudge, wink, wink. Also, just as the end credits start, there is a scene that gives you a glimpse of how stop-motion works. It's rated ""PG"" for action and mild rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental."
93,The Boxtrolls,6,15 March 2015,"Nothing New, But Impressive and Sweet","Laika may not be the best production company in terms of production. But they have to be near the top in terms of utterly impressive looking films. I watched The Boxtrolls in Blu-Ray and I was astounded by the look of it. I really don't know how these filmmakers do this. Or more unbelievably how they have the patience over the course of several years to make the slightest of changes to the film.The story isn't too dissimilar than anything we have seen in the past. In fact, it's basically Tarzan in terms of the major plot points. A boy is taken in by a group of a different species and raised as one of their own. Then a menacing and bitter man comes along and tries to tear the species world apart. Am I describing Tarzan or Boxtrolls? Nevertheless it's a sweet film for the most part. The Boxtrolls are nowhere near as cute as Minions for comparison, but they do serve a purpose and capture the screen with joy and life. The villain, apparently voiced by Ben Kingsley, wasn't anything too special but he did make for some amazing animated moments. I say apparently because you cant tell who voiced any of these characters at all. There are plenty of talented people who contributed such as Tracy Morgan, Richard Ayoade, Nick Frost, and Jared Harris. But not one of them uses their normal voices.The characters are full of clichés, for example those clumsy and utterly stupid henchman. I'm pretty tired of the one dimensional henchman who don't further any story point, but they did have a few comedic moments. The story also doesn't necessarily explain how these Boxtrolls came to be or anything but I guess that's not really the point. The film has some great messages for kids about acceptance and courage. But i'm not even sure kids will be allowed to see it, considering it has many dark scenes. Overall I was pleased with the visuals but the rest of the film fell short.+Laika's incredible visuals +Voice cast is unrecognizable -Henchman-Story is a bit derivative 6.5/10"
94,The Boxtrolls,10,26 December 2014,I just loved this one!,"I'm a sucker for animated films and we are living in what I call the Golden Era of them because they are no longer considered for kids only and they are made to be enjoyed by the young and old. The same company that produced and created the amazing ""Coraline"" and, one of my favorites, ""ParaNorman,"" created this new one ""The Boxtrolls"" and they, once again, knocked it out of the park! I have absolutely no complaints about this film because I loved every single solitary second of it! The voice acting is just incredible and the cast is filled with talented actors who really knew how to bring their characters to life. The animation is epic and near mind-blowing! The characters all move so fluidly and realistically while still being over-the-top enough to form an animated film. They were crafted and brought to life so amazingly that the fictional world where the boxtrolls live is easy to engross yourself in and it is filled with so much rich detail. Finally, the story is very entertaining and is capable of blending humor and heart perfectly. It would make me cry, make me laugh, and, most of all, just fill me with excitement and an overall sense of fun from the entire entertaining presentation.Like I said, there was nothing I didn't like about ""The Boxtrolls."" It is so well made and put together that it is just pure entertainment that never ceased to be satisfying and fun. I just loved this film."
95,The Boxtrolls,8,23 December 2014,The Best Yet,"Having gone into watching ""The Boxtrolls,"" i was hearing more negative reviews. Some were saying that it was not as good as other stop animation movies, while others were saying that it was too childish and not as dark as other movies like paranorman or Coralie.What i got instead was the best stop animation i have seen to date, with a very relevant story, that even adults will thoroughly enjoy! I am not sure if this movie was one hundred percent stop animation, but the effects are superb, this movie clearly had masters of their art painstakingly creating every frame, which truly looks and feels like actual moving characters.As for the story, it was actually quite deep, and there was plenty of witty humor to be found throughout, and interesting paradigms to be drawn. The story also showed how easily man can turn out to be the true monsters in the world.The set and tone was all very pleasing to look at, and fit the subject manner of the movie perfectly.All in all, do not miss out on this movie as it is truly superior to the majority of all animated movies to date!"
96,The Boxtrolls,6,12 October 2014,Not really for kids..,"This movie was a strange one. It was billed for children, but I found that some of the imagery would likely scare the pants of any kids below tween age. That and it dealt with themes such as death, cross-dressing, and loss. These are fairly mature topics for a kids movie.This movie felt very much like a Tim Burton clone, but it was much darker in my opinion. Much of the imagery was gloomy and depressing. The tone was just plain strange for a children's movie.I think this movie could be considered a kids movie for adults and a PG-13 rating with a change in marketing could have easily pointed it in that direction.If you look at it that way, the movie was interesting and unique. The animation and characters models were top notch and you really get engrossed in this fantastical world of evil and boxtrolls. The voice acting in this movie was exceptional. In particular, Ben Kingsley is evil at it's finest as Archibald Snatcher. What a fantastic job he did.In the end, I thought this was a good movie but probably not as kid friendly as you have been led to believe. If you go in with this understanding, you will enjoy it...strangeness and all."
97,The Boxtrolls,6,3 October 2014,6/10,"Boxtrolls isn't in anyway up-to-par with the other amazing animated offerings we have had this year, nor it is a an above average animated feature, but it definitely comes off as recommendable and certainly watchable.Out of the three acts of this movie there is no denying that the first one is the best. It's very nostalgic and pulls succedigly a lot on the heartstrings. Moreover it offers some sweet, eye-popping animation and lays the ground for the story to come in an interesting manner. Unfortunately its following two acts fail to recreate the magic of the first, but still have their advantages. By 2014 I have come to expect some very good laughs from American blockbuster animated cinema and I have come to expect them frequently through the movie. Boxtrolls does not offer that portion of laughs, yet it does have its jokes and its funny moments. Unfortunately even these moments come to be ruined by the end of the second act because all of the beats are repeated again and again until they become annoying. Still on the positive side we have gorgeous animation with amazing character design that will certainly get you through the movie without ever being totally bored. There is also an emotional core of the movie that had me occasionally feeling for the characters, but ultimately left me a little dry. Where the movie really lost me was in its execution of the second and third act. They are very predictable and have nothing interesting or surprising going on. The third act dragged a lot and could have been definitely cut.This animated movie is a step down from the excellence of this year, but it is in no way a disaster or a bad movie, I would just recommend skipping it in the theaters and watching it at home if you really wanted to."
98,The Boxtrolls,10,28 September 2014,"Apprehensive going in, left VERY PLEASED!","I'm not going to be pretentious about this movie and dissect it to its bones revealing some mind-blowing, deeper meaning. The movie is, simply, wonderful and charming. I took my 2 year old to see it with the bad taste of Paranorman in my mouth (though I loved Coraline). At first I thought neither of us would enjoy it. It's not ""cute"" like her typical favorites--the likes of Despicable Me and Frozen. I automatically judged it to be too dark of a children's film for my liking. However, within a few minutes I found myself more engaged in this film than I have been in any film of late. The ""grotesque monsters"" are, in one word, lovable. I was tickled by the character names; Eggs, Fish, Shoes. The movie is creative and fun injected with some adult humor. The plot is positively predictable so you'll have to watch it with a soft heart and an open mind. If you expect some psycho thriller, mind-bending twist or you're one of those people who can't take a movie for what it is because you take everything too seriously, then it's definitely not for you.Oh yea, and my daughter enjoyed it too."
99,The Boxtrolls,8,28 September 2014,"A kid's movie which shows how foolish, arrogant, and gullible adults are. Even when all the evidence needed is right before their eyes.","Though ParaNorman, Laika's last production, didn't really hit it out of the park with me, being that I didn't know this was their newest film, I didn't walk in with any preconceived notions. I just remember seeing the trailer somewhere, advertisements pop up, and thought this would be a cute movie to see. One which unfortunately would have a theater filled with kids, but if you want to see films like these that is something you have to deal with. I digress though, for the real question is whether this film has more broad appeal than ParaNorman, or if it is just another company's futile attempt to stand out of the shadow of Disney's domination.Characters & StoryEggs (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) has been raised by a box troll named Fish since he was a baby. The two bond over music, scavenging, and also eating various forms of bugs together. But sometime around Eggs' 10th year of life, he finds that his massive family is starting to disappear. The reason? One man named Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley). Someone born low on the totem pole of a fictional town and who wants to rise up to prominence by any means necessary.So, using the fact the people of this town are completely ignorant about the box trolls being harmless, never mind cowards, he begins using propaganda in order to present them as a threat that only he, and his henchmen Mr. Trout (Nick Frost), Mr. Pickles (Richard Ayoade), and Mr. Gristle (Tracy Morgan) can stop. Though, for his assistance, he must be given by Lord Portley-Rind (Jared Harris) a White Hat and a seat at their cheese tasting table. Both of which are the highest honest in the land.However, standing in his way are Eggs and Lord Portley-Rind's daughter Winnie (Elle Fanning), a girl completely obsessed with the tale of the evil, baby stealing, and eating, box trolls. Though with these two children only ten, at the very least, and no adult really taking note of them, how in the world will they save any box trolls?PraiseI love films like these and Ernest & Celestine which go beyond being cute, seemingly kid friendly, entertainment and actually presents deeper themes. Such as Archibald doing whatever it takes to become respected and on the level of the wealthy class. For in his story you are presented with a villain who pretty much is solely evil because, from what it seems, the world of the film lacks social mobility. So what are the poor to do but squash the weaker and smaller and try to rise up on their shoulders?Also, it presents the classic notion of never judging a book by its cover, as well as getting to know about something, or someone, yourself before making any judgments. For, like in Ernest & Celestine, it seems largely the adults of the town are completely ignorant on the topic of box trolls, and solely base their knowledge on them on what they were spoon fed. And damn if they weren't wrong about those of which they feared and were prejudice against. Almost seeming like racist who have never met this type of person they have been taught to hate, and perhaps fear, yet never really seeing or meeting one with their own eyes. Never mind giving them a chance to prove the stories against them are true.CriticismWhen it comes to the film's issues, perhaps the main one a parent may not like is the fact it makes it seem kids will be ignored if they go to an adult for help, and be ignored if they try to tell on another adult, no matter how much evidence they present. Though, as someone without children, my main issue was the fact Lord Portley- Rind spent an exuberant amount of money on cheese, and did so over taking care of local government needs like the budget for the children's school, or even building a hospital. Making it seem Laika wanted to possibly get a little political, but then decided against it so that they wouldn't have a polarizing issue which could affect the film.Overall: Worth SeeingFrom beautiful animation, a cute story which may get you teary eyed, and a villain which is a bit more complex than your usual kid's movie baddie, you get quite a film. One which, I would argue, will likely get nominated for multiple accolades and, depending on the competition, at this point I think should win. Hence the ""Worth Seeing"" label."
100,The Boxtrolls,6,20 October 2014,The Underdog's Jockey,"I'm rooting for the underdog.Not to win or place.Not necessarily to show, either.The Boxtrolls is not terrific.It's good, but pick the superior visual treat.The Book of Life is the movie you should be seeing, not The Boxtrolls.There, I said it!The Academy nominates three to five pictures for Best Animated Feature.

But Doof doesn't seem to notice.Because, hey, it's just a kid's movie, right?"
101,The Boxtrolls,7,13 May 2017,Deserving of higher praise and ratings,"The undergrounds of Cheesebridge are the Boxtrolls' home. They are tiny odd gray beings with onomatopoeic language, who use grocery boxes as a dress, and live from collecting metal junk at night. They are considered baby snatchers, but they are very loving creatures; in fact, they've raised human baby 'Eggs'. Their life and future existence is threatened by the ugly, nasty, cheese-allergic, drag-queeny Archibald Snatcher and his two wicked assistants Mr Trout & Mr Pickles. Snatcher wants to exterminate the Boxtrolls ASAP to obtain a white hat and become part of the Town Council, as he dreams of respectability and of sharing the Council's cheese tasting sessions and discussions. Winnie, the Major Lord Portley-Rind's neglected daughter, meets Eggs by chance one night and, together, they start an adventure to try to rescue the fast-disappearing Boxtrolls and to expose Snatcher's wickedness and lies to the town.The Boxtrolls is one of my favorite stop-motion animated films of the last years even though it is not that popular, or that well-known, or it wasn't that much of a hit when it first came out. It has everything to please both children and adults and entertain them both. Based upon Alan Snow's 'Here Be Monsters', the film feels like one of those old European tales we all love, mixed with some Burton-ish imagery and a cute sprinkle of the Minions.The film has a great visual style, is utterly funny and entertaining, has a great tempo and, most importantly, has great anti-hero heroes and despicable villains. It is perfect for adults because it has great dialogues and is witty, but it has lots of adventure and charm, and is tender and sweet at times.The production design is incredible, and the micro-expressions of some of the leading characters are amazing, especially Eggs', who feels real as real it can be. The actors are really well cast for their roles, especially Isaac Hempstead Wright as Eggs, Ben Kingsley as Snatcher, Richard Ayoade as Mr Pickles, Nick Frost as Mr Trout, and Jared Harris as Lord Portley-Rind. I thought that they were all brilliant at voicing their characters. The rest of the cast were also very good.Give the Boxtrolls a chance to entertain you."
102,The Boxtrolls,7,29 December 2015,"The stop motion animation is nice, even if the story is obvious and somewhat derivative","This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Feature, losing to Big Hero 6. There will be spoilers ahead: I'm of decidedly mixed feelings about this film. On the whole, I did find it enjoyable. The animation is good, the voice work was extremely good, the other technical aspects were decent, the pacing was good. Yet I couldn't escape the relative ordinariness of the plot and the script.It's an obvious and somewhat derivative script, for one thing. Outsiders shunned by the world and even hunted down for being different. One of them, our hero, decides to fight back, contends against their enemies and wins out.There's nothing inherently wrong with this. The basic plots of some of the greatest films, books and plays would sound almost as ordinary if stripped to their basics. The problem here is more or less in the execution. Unfortunately, the film hinges on literally every adult being crazy, evil, stupid or some combination of those or it falls apart. Not one of them is able to summon up any sense except one of the main villain's henchmen and he comes to that rather late in the film.There are two characters who show any determination or intellect for most of the film-Eggs, a human boy raised by the box-trolls and Winnie, the daughter of the town leader, a cheese-obsessed nitwit with the sense God gave a light bulb. Lord Portley-Rind is led down the garden path by the villain, Snatcher (even the character names make plot points obvious from the start). It's obvious just who Eggs is almost immediately and it's just a matter of the film running its course.There's little in the way of suspense to this and, depending on just how many films like this you've seen, you can just about tick off plot devices as you go, until the guaranteed moment when the villain receives his comeuppance and sentiment turns around in the favor of the outcasts. There's a fair amount to like here, but I wish they'd done a bit more work on the script.This film is available on a Blu-Ray/DVD combo and it looks particularly nice on Blu-Ray."
103,The Boxtrolls,10,3 July 2015,"""The Boxtrolls"" is a superior animated film!","""The Boxtrolls"" is the third stellar stop-motion film produced by Laika, the same production company that also made the excellent ""Coraline"" and the underrated ""ParaNorman."" It is a superior animated film -- far better than most animated features that see widespread release. It's funny, a little bit ""scary,"" smart, a little profound, and altogether wonderful. Also, its detailed stop-motion animation is a marvel to watch.The story of ""Boxtrolls"" involves an orphaned boy who is adopted by a race of box-wearing creatures who live under the streets of the towering British hamburg of Cheesebridge. These creatures, the boxtrolls, are gentle, misunderstood tinkerers, who come up out of the manhole-covers at night to scavenge for whatever shiny trinkets and machine-parts they can find lying about. They also fix things, oil squeaky hinges and whatnot. Then they retire to their underground cave, and work on building their fantastical, Rube Goldberg-esque contraptions.The boy, who grows to the cusp of adolescence believing himself to be a boxtroll, is named Eggs. The boxtrolls, being an extremely practical lot, take their names from whatever box they wear. The stencil on the boy's box says ""Eggs."" So that's what they call him. The trolls have, alas, come under the scorn of the population of Cheesebridge, whose fears are fueled by the colorfully horrific stories of Archibald Snatcher, a pest-exterminator who wants to destroy every last boxtroll, for reasons which are fairly transparent but also kind of hilariously specific. Snatcher spins tales of the boxtrolls sneaking into unlocked rooms at night, kidnapping infant children, devouring them, and picking their teeth with the bones. The boy we know as Eggs, in fact, figures prominently into the mythology Snatcher spins.The boxtrolls, therefore, find their numbers dwindling as Snatcher and his three goons persist in their extermination efforts. Rattling recklessly through the narrow streets at night atop his towering pest- control truck, intoning tales of horror through the truck's public- address system, and encouraging the terrified citizens of Cheesebridge to STAY INSIDE AFTER CURFEW, Snatcher is a nightmarish presence. He is voiced by Ben Kingsley (Ghandi!), who brings a theatrical kind of menace (and humor) to the role. He must have had a lot of fun with this part.Lord Portly-Rind, who is sort of the mayor of Cheesebridge, doesn't quite know what to do with Snatcher. Portly-Rind simply wants to spend as much time as possible in his mansion's ""Tasting Room,"" where he and his upper-crust company don white hats and pretend to make important decisions, but really just spend their time tasting expensive cheeses. And yet, here is Snatcher talking tales of horror, and promising Portly- Rind that he'll make the streets safe again... in exchange for a white hat.Because Snatcher wants, more than anything else, to be accepted amongst the Cheesebridge upper-crust. His wildest ambition is to share the cheese in Portly-Rind's tasting-room, regardless of the fact that cheese does unspeakable things to his body.Meanwhile, Portly-Rind has a daughter, Winnie, who is frustrated by the lack of attention she receives from her dad. So, she acts out in certain ways, and has developed a rather morbid fixation on the boxtrolls and the horror she thinks they represent.The story involves Eggs' efforts to locate Fish -- the troll who has become his surrogate father -- after Fish is abducted by Snatcher's goons. This journey leads Eggs to cross paths with Winnie, who is fascinated by his familiarity with boxtrolls, and who essentially ends up teaming-up with him.The story is quirky and funny, and younger children might find it a little scary, but its scariness is of the sort that children often delight in, portrayed with glee and a ghoulish sense of fun, and never with a cynical or mean-spirited sensibility.My favorite bits of the film involved two of Snatcher's goons, Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout, who are under the impression that they're the ""good guys"" in the battle against the boxtrolls.""Do you think these boxtrolls understand the duality of good and evil, Mr. Trout?"" asks Mr. Pickles as he and his cohorts close-in on a cowering boxtroll in an alleyway.""I suppose so,"" replies Mr. Trout. ""They know we're the good guys. That's why they run from us.""This amusing and unexpected semi-philosophical banter continues throughout the film, as the two men begin to suspect that perhaps they're not playing on the team they want to be playing on.These asides are kind of brilliant, and refreshing to hear in an animated feature. And it's hard to argue with the film's theme of acceptance, as the citizens of Cheesebridge gradually learn that they have nothing to fear from the boxtrolls. There's another theme, too, wrapped-up in how Archibald Snatcher is revealed to be the film's true villain; it's about how self-interested people can prey on popular ignorance, dividing us out of fear, to serve their own ends.It's fairly heady material for a kids' film, sure. But kids will be entertained by the action-packed adventure elements, and the various funny gross-out moments (like Eggs and the boxtrolls feasting on bugs). The fact that those kid-friendly elements are wrapped-up in a story as smart and original as this is quite special.One more note: If you do watch this film, be sure to stick around during the ending credits. There's a scene involving Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout about halfway through the credits, which reveals the labor- intensive animation process. It's kind of breathtaking, and rather profound."
104,The Boxtrolls,7,2 July 2015,a perfect work of art,"Yet another great film! The Boxtrolls is a wonderfully created movie with the perfect script. The graphics are of great quality, and the voices by all of the wonderful cast fit their character just right. I really liked this movie and the story was very thorough, and not offset or weak like most of this style. The Boxtrolls themselves had their unique look and the boxes which were their names just said it all for me. Great concept and all together a perfectly rounded movie.The Boxtrolls did have that feel of Corpse Bride as it began, which actually made it more comfortable for me to settle into. That late night knock at the door, that suspicious look, wow it was just great to watch. I highly recommend checking out this movie, one of the most parts I enjoyed is that this film is good per all ages. Great Job!"
105,The Boxtrolls,10,9 June 2015,"A true gem, though controversial","I am rarely amazed by animated movies. Most of the ones my kids begged me to watch with them I slept through. But this one kept me up well past my bedtime. Imagine every metaphor done to perfection - every cliché exposed, every cultural norm questioned - all in a way that most people won't even be perceptive enough to notice. It's hard to talk about this film without giving spoilers or falling into the traps laid by those who don't want you (or especially your kids!) to watch it. I can only assure you it is that rare combination of great entertainment and great art. I hope a few will believe me before falling victim to the real ""trolls"". And nothing is subversive - unless you think the truth of being human is subversive."
106,The Boxtrolls,7,31 May 2015,Who let the Trolls out? (Who? Who? Who?),"The movie/story itself is decent but full of clichés. It's nothing that will really surprise you, but it might move you a bit. Some will like the kind of ""animation"" that is used here, other will dismiss it. Maybe you should watch the trailer, just so you know what you are up for (so you're not surprised).The message of the movie is pretty clear and the movie while aimed at the small ones, will have a couple of things to keep the adults interested. Something Pixar does to perfection but is nicely handled here too. Some things may seem a bit bleak and dark, but the overall tone is nicely handled. Everybody needs love ..."
107,The Boxtrolls,5,29 May 2015,Poorly motivated plot and heavy-handed cleverness,"This movie clearly motivates itself around good vs. evil and Nazi/holocaust plot themes, but the delivery is poor due to the overuse of 4th-wall breaking meta-dialog, which involves characters that are supposed to be dumb underlings talking intellectually/philosophically about their misgiving in their role in the lead character's scheme. A better script would have shown occasional pangs of guilt or confusion in an otherwise clueless character, offering more emotion and subtlety and inviting empathy on the part of the audience. Instead, the overwrought dialog is too on-the-nose for adults, yet too complex for children. The lead villain (Snatcher) is simultaneously quite brilliant yet also remarkably dense at times (such as in the first cheese-eating incident, where the henchman run intellectual rings around him, for some unmotivated reason). I suppose this conjures up old Gargamel (Smurfs), who plays this duality brilliantly in the original cartoons, but it somehow doesn't play well here. The henchmen characters also make frequent references to the story as if they were outside of it. This is an inside joke for the writers, presumably, but it's really not all that funny for the rest of us. Nothing is gained by taking us out of the story experience; the joke is stale (and not cleverly executed).The animation is wonderful, however, and I believe it's actually stop-motion, not computer animation, which makes it really phenomenal."
108,The Boxtrolls,6,29 May 2015,Fun animated feature.,"Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi direct this fun-filled animated film based on the novel Here Be Monsters by Alan Snow. In the Victorian era village of Cheesebridge, a young orphan boy Eggs(Isacc Hempstead Wright)is raised by a fun-loving group of Boxtrolls that are underground cave-dwelling trash collectors. Above is a community that is obsessed with class, wealth and above all else...stinky cheese! The young orphan finds out that he is a real flesh and blood boy from a little girl named Winnie(Elle Fanning). With her help, Eggs will try his best to save the Boxtrolls from an evil exterminator, Archibald Snatcher(Ben Kingsley).Smaller children may have bad dreams, although there is a likable hero and a nasty villain and of course a happy ending. This should be fun for all age of viewers. Other stars lending their voices to this enchanting movie: Dee Bradley Baker, Jared Harris, Tracy Morgan, Steve Blum, Richard Ayoade and Nick Frost."
109,The Boxtrolls,6,11 April 2015,"Okay, so i just saw a film......","The summary explains my reaction after watching Boxtrolls. I didn't like it i didn't hate it. It was like i have seen a film which was good for one time but i don't want to remember it again. What i am saying is that it was not one of those movies you discuss after you've watched it. Boxtrolls is about a boy who is parented by some cave dwelling creatures. I saw that some great actors have given their voices to the characters. The subject is new, no doubt, but i was getting bored after watching 20 min of it. Then the pace of the movie rises. It starts to throw different situations on the screen to make you laugh, to make you cry, to smile in admiration etc. All i am saying is if you want a movie that should be easy going and you don't want to stress your mind afterward thinking about it, here it is. You'll have a good time watching it. It will not be a profound experience but it will do."
110,The Boxtrolls,7,4 April 2015,"""Living in a cardboard, Living in a cardboard box...""","All animated films with a conflict need a decent villain, and The Boxtrolls has a great one: A snivelling, merciless, cheese-obsessed, nasty piece of work called Archibald Snatcher. Voiced by the unmistakable Ben Kingsley, he kidnaps friendly trolls who only want to collect junk at night on the surface from their underground base, lies to the population of a small town that they devour small children so they give him carte blanche in taking the innocent creatures, before setting them to work as slaves building a device which he thinks will help him take over the place. And by 'take over' I mean... Sit at a table, and munch on Brie all day long with the other aristocrats. To top it all off, he's allergic to the dairy product... and swells up hideously every time he's anywhere near it. Go figure.Into this mess are thrown two kids: One who was raised by the boxtrolls as one of their own after his father went missing ( and the subject of Archibald's fibs to the townsfolk) and a little posh girl from the upper echelons of society who has an unhealthy interest in gore at such a tender age. She is VERY disappointed to find out the trolls are not the cannibalistic monsters of yore, but nevertheless agrees to help the boy in rescuing his missing friends and possibly discover what happened to his absent dad. I won't spoil what unfurls for you... But I will offer a single hint. JELLY!!The Boxtrolls is an engaging piece, brilliantly animated using stop-motion technology (there's even a joke about the whole process after the credits have rolled) filled with lovable characters and hilarious voiceovers. The boxtrolls themselves are brilliant creations... Stark naked apart from their little cardboard containers, each one named after the produce that it initially contained, they communicate in a monosyllabic way and their antics are always hilarious. They reminded me of the minions in the Despicable Me franchise... Only, with a bit more charm. It's a fabulous slice of family entertainment, and one worth re-watching just to appreciate just how much detail was put into the production.YEARS AND YEARS worth. Got that?! You ungrateful little... 7/10"
111,The Boxtrolls,7,1 April 2015,Dark But An Enjoyably Amusing Animation,"I had a few reservations about seeing The Boxtrolls when I first saw trailers for it as I didn't think it looked all that good, plus it has a Tim Burton look & feel to it which is another reason why I wasn't sure about the film. I don't mind Tim Burton but his animations are vastly over-rated, but that's a moot point anyway because he had nothing to do with The Boxtrolls (thankfully). Anyway, I bit the bullet and decided to watch the movie and I'm glad I did because it is actually a really good, entertaining animation.This movie is a step back to the old stop-motion animation we were used to seeing years ago, and no doubt there will be a section of people out there that will probably dislike it because it's not the usual animation we've become accustomed to (I actually read a review where the writer called the animator's ""stupid"" for using such a ""time wasting technique""!). It definitely has a distinct style - which is quite dark at times - and look and I think people will either hate it or love it.The story itself is a wee bit predictable (as all animation movies are, really), and while the younger viewers - 7-year-olds or younger - may not get what's going on plot-wise, they more than likely won't care. Did they care about the plot for Shrek, Dumbo, Wreck It Ralph? No, they will be more interested in how the film actually plays out, how it looks, how funny they find it, etc. Some of the film's scene's MAY be a wee bit too intense for the younger ones too, but if they can watch the specific notorious Bambi and Lion King scenes then this film will be no problem.This isn't a side-splitting humorous movie either, but there are a good few chuckle moments scattered throughout, mainly coming from Archibald Snatcher's cheese allergy and the boxtrolls various antics, which will appeal more to the younger audience.The Boxtrolls won't be to everybody's taste, but ignore any hate you read about it and judge for yourself as it is most definitely worth a watch."
112,The Boxtrolls,4,24 March 2015,A good studio makes a mediocre film,"I don't see how this even got this many nominations for best animated feature and writing and such. This is the most annoying film to be released in almost a decade. There are better films to watch than this horror.The little girl is the most clichéd character on the film, she helps the feral child to be human. She complains to Eggs and the boxtrolls about their lives and even bosses them around while Eggs just doesn't do anything. I really wish I could see Eggs conflict her. And we had enough of this child too-mature-for-own-age trope. It would've been better to see her threatened to fire instead of Eggs. Lord and Lady Portley-rind are parents that don't tend to their daughter and it's annoying how they develop her parents but not Eggs's. Snatcher became an annoying jerk towards the end. The boxtrolls are Minion knockoffs that also got annoying because they didn't want to escape from Snatcher. Though while, everyone in there except for the little girl and her parents are good, Eggs is the best character of the film because he has a better background, attitude and just incredibly cute. He's a great role model. I would love to adopt a boy like Eggs. But he's also an underdeveloped, gross, and passive character.The movie is too dark for a kids movie and even an adult's movie, maybe more drafting could've gotten it a PG-13 rating. It focuses on the saccharine relationship of two kids that turns into a love interest. Some morals are preachy such as talking about families. And I don't like the idea of a feral child growing up among boxtrolls, and he has to enlist the help of a little girl (who's a bad role model) to stop Snatcher's evil plans and put behind the town's hate for the boxtrolls. I didn't even sympathize with the characters. The finale was silly but somewhat interesting, followed by a silly happy resolution. Some of the humor doesn't even make me laugh, part of the reason was because I thought it should lean more towards drama for a story like this. Plus, it's a messy plot. Eggs was supposed to be the central character of the film and they go and let a few other characters take over. Maybe they would get the chance to explain more about Eggs if they hadn't focused on explaining the other characters.Can't believe that Laika has lost their touch after two good movies, seriously, this is the best they could come up with? After all that work put into it? This film would've been my all-time favorite if these problems were fixed. Hopefully, they'll pick up on the next one.Rating: 5.9/10"
113,The Boxtrolls,10,10 February 2015,"An absolute delight, philosophical allegories and still great for kids","From the very beginning characters spring to life in a way that I have not seen in an animated film for some time. Characters are developed in a rather unique way, due to the various limited forms of communication, we see it all in a new way. The film is much deeper than what you see, posing important structural questions about modern day society. This was not at all what I expected from a large budget Hollywood film. I suspect the stop-motion subculture being behind it's production breathed originality into the script and direction, with the team not being afraid to explore the undiscovered. Animation was sound, the only thing I think the movie lacked was a solid soundtrack. You can watch this movie and put no thought into it and love it, or watch it and have a little food for thought or a café conversation later on. Enjoy."
114,The Boxtrolls,,1 February 2015,Could've been much better,"Overall it was OK. It had some great elements that sometimes came together well, but often didn't. The ending was lackluster. It was very funny, occasionally.What ruined it for me was the transphobic content. Otherwise I probably would've given it a 6. That was completely unnecessary and offensive.The best part of the whole thing was in the credits at the end, so if you do see it, make sure to wait for that.I really expected more from the same people who made ParaNorman, which was great and very inclusive.I'm really surprised this won the Oscar over The LEGO Movie--that was way better."
115,The Boxtrolls,7,31 January 2015,Some Positive Some Negative,"Positives: 1. Creative storyline (not a we've-seen-it-many-times-before) script. 2. Fairly good voicing (unusual achievement when using well known actors instead of voice professionals). 3. Very time consuming and dedicated CGI, modeling, composition, motion capture, texture, shading. 4. Quirky with individuality. 5. Some moralistic teaching about kindness, understanding, sharing, etc. Negatives: 1.The main protagonists were too formulaic-stereotypic (think ""Train Your Dragon"") which is becoming far too common in animation these past few years where male and female features elicit that autonomic response ""awww - so cute"". Bad guys ""ughhh - get away"" look. 2. Most importantly something, which I can't pinpoint, in the story or how the characters were presented did not capture/connect me emotionally or intellectually. Neutral: 1. Not a good choice for under age 9 or so audience unless they've developed an appreciation for weirdness."
116,The Boxtrolls,5,15 January 2015,Honest attempt but sadly disappointing.,"I was really amused by Coraline and Paranorman, two refreshingly great animation films by stop-motion sensation Laika. The Boxtrolls with its intriguing concept of underground trolls wearing boxes seemed like another welcome addition. Unfortunately I felt it was too bland and generic with its story, which were the strong points of both Coraline and Paranorman. The Boxtrol is neither as imaginative/spooky as Coraline nor is laughs-filled like Paranorman. Despite being adapted from the storybook ""Here Be Monsters"" it kind-of had been there, done that feeling.The story is set in place called Cheesbridge where people's status was associated with the quality of cheese they eat. The people there have only one fear, that is of the The Boxtrolls, who mischievous creature/trolls wearing boxes that collect things that amuse them at night. One day, they take away a little boy making people more scared of them. They begin to think of them as horrid human-eating creatures. Meanwhile we shown that the Boxtrolls are raising the boy with lots of love and these creatures are not even close to the terrifying image set in the minds of people of Cheesebridge. Responsible for most of this rumor is evil man named Snatcher who resents Boxtrolls more than anyone and promises one of the lords of the town that he will get rid of all Boxtrolls in exchange for a place in government's body. The boy going by the name 'eggs' raised by boxtrolls thinks he himself is boxtroll until he gets exposed to much to the above ground world. He soon gets the key-role of protecting the boxtrolls from the wrath of Snatcher. There is nothing new in the screenplay. While the characters where interesting, the lead boy looks far too similar to the in Paranorman. The Boxtrolls who are good builders and innovative were nice done. But again, their story felt like clichéd mix-up between the Minions of 'Despicable Me' and Dragons of 'How to train your Dragon'. The whole 'we were wrong about them all this time' is used.Among the voice cast, Isaac Hempstead Wright our Bran Stark from Game of Thrones does a decent job voicing Eggs. Also not to forget, Ben Kingsley as Snatcher. The stop-motion animation is great, Laika rose really high even if they are just at the start with 3 films. The overall setting is bit dull and grotesque, if might not be liked by kids but still has its charm at some points. Its not funny most of the time and also has nothing special to offer which made it slightly boring. In the end, I think it was nice attempt with good animation by Laika but the story was a let down.RATING: [2.5/5]"
117,The Boxtrolls,7,12 January 2015,A great stop-motion to watch. Nice and refreshing,A great stop animation movie. A normal story line but with enough suspense to capture your attention. You will fall in love with the box-troll characters. Filled with nice screenplays. It also tries to address social issue of stereotyping and blind following. A movie worth watching. Even though its a stop-motion movie the scenes are so well composed that you will not even feel like it. It also makes us think about how a civilized society can sometime act so much uncivilized.Story: 6/10 | Direction: 7/10 | Acting/Actors/Characters: 8/10 | Cinematography: 9/10 | Structure and Impact: 8/10Total:7/10
118,The Boxtrolls,,31 December 2014,Marred Only By Its Comparison To Coraline & ParaNorman,"From the creators of Coraline & ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls is the latest feature from Laika which is once again affectionately crafted, exquisitely animated & wonderfully told but compared to the studio's previous two efforts, it's an underwhelming experience on the whole scale. It's no less enjoyable or entertaining & promises a good time but unlike those two, is certainly not a memorable story.Based on Alan Snow's children's novel Here Be Monsters, the story of The Boxtrolls is set in the fictional town of Cheesebridge & concerns a young orphaned boy named Eggs who was raised by underground cave-dwelling, trash collecting trolls and later tries to save them from Archibald Snatcher; a pest terminator, and in the process ends up finding about his origin.Finely written & nicely directed, the plot is less scary & more adventurous this time, humour is a mixed bag as some moments work amazingly well while a few others pale, characters are unfortunately not very fleshed out & hence not that interesting, the picture is elegantly photographed, narrative is steadily paced & its stop-motion animation is once again state-of- the-art stuff.On an overall scale, The Boxtrolls is another impressive work of handcrafted creativity from Laika that's beautifully brought alive by its cleverly chosen voice cast but compared to what this animation studio has managed to accomplish in the past, much more was expected from this feature. Still an enjoyable ride that's marred by its comparison to both Coraline & ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls is definitely worth a shot."
119,The Boxtrolls,8,28 December 2014,A Marvelous Stop-Motion Yarn After Eons,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 starsAmerican stop-motion animation studio, Laika's, best offering since the stupendous ""Coraline"", ""The Boxtrolls"" is packed with enough offbeat wit and visual splendor to offer a healthy dose of entertainment for all ages. The movie is the cherry on top of what has been a splendid year for animated fare, beginning with ""The Lego Movie"" back in February and continuing with ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"", ""The Book of Life"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"".""The Boxtrolls"" is set in a world that runs in a parallel universe akin to that of a Charles Dickens novel, with creatively named characters involved in seemingly outlandish adventures in a Victorian-era society, which is strongly metaphorical of our own pseudo-moralities and misguided ideologies. A family event movie from the creators of ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman"" that introduces audiences to a new breed of family - ""The Boxtrolls"", a community of quirky, mischievous creatures who have lovingly raised an orphaned human boy named Eggs (voiced by Isaac Hempstead Wright) in the amazing cavernous home they've built beneath the streets of a city called Cheesebridge. When the town's villain, Archibald Snatcher (Oscar winner Ben Kingsley), comes up with a plot to get rid of the Boxtrolls, Eggs decides to venture above ground and ""into the light"", where he meets and teams up with fabulously feisty Winnifred (Elle Fanning). Together, they devise a daring plan to save Eggs' family.Based on the well-received children's novel, ""Here Be Monsters"", by Alan Snow, the film brilliantly showcases the stealth allegory of the insidious nature of gossip as a tool of domination, and the scathing class satire of misbegotten and socially unjust personal goals, which carry a productive sting that should leave kids smarting but a bit wiser. While the film contains some scary images and dark moments that could frighten the very little kiddies, it should entertain a wide swath of the public as the humor is easily relatable to multiple generations. Admittedly, the bugs, slime, dirt, ugliness, and unkempt hair could get a tad harrowing for the little ones, but if you and your kids can get past those necessary ingredients, the story is a pretty good one. ""The Boxtrolls"" combines heart with a streak of Roald Dahl's perversity, and will have special appeal for viewers who get British humor.The characters in this tale display oodles of charm that stems from their exuberantly animated personalities; not a prettied-up Disney- fied exterior. They look like they've been crafted from materials found in the back closet of an arts-and-crafts class. And the animation itself features the very best in modern stop-motion technique - textured and handcrafted, it resembles a blend of claymation, grotesque style (a hallmark of stop-motion animation - both old and new), pop- up book effects, and a strong cup of English eccentricity. The movie also has many of the studio's signature elements: bizarre angles, strange-looking characters, and a kind of fearlessness, an ability to gaze at darkness head-on.Overall, ""The Boxtrolls"" is delightfully weird fare that treats its audience intelligently. Although the plot does have sparse moments where it lags, the writers are Directors are smart enough to quickly overcome such minor haggles with a unique turn of events of some kind or another. Grim in tone and featuring a lively cast of voice- actors, the film is a visual treat and its tale should provide immense satisfaction to those who revel in a touch of macabre, adults and children alike. It took years of blood, sweat, and clay to come to life, but boy the wait was well worth it. Quirkily narrated, weird in tone, and beautifully unusual, ""The Boxtrolls"" is almost impossible to not love."
120,The Boxtrolls,8,14 November 2014,"Not exactly strong, but the entertainment value makes it worth it","I went to see this with my brother almost six weeks ago, hoping that it would live up to my expectations. Turns out, it was a really good experience although it's not the strongest animated film like say this year's The Lego Movie and How To Train Your Dragon 2.First, there are some good stuff in it. It has some good characters thanks to some excellent voice cast including Isaac Hempston Wright, Ben Kingsley, Elle Fanning, and Simon Pegg. Eggs and Winnie, the two main protagonists, are fine for the most part, but the best character goes to Archibald Snatcher. He's intimidating, and his motivation for capturing the Boxtrolls is explained very well. Also, the Boxtrolls themselves are adorable and cute at the same time.The music is pretty good, too. It keeps the right balance between comedy and it's dark moments. But the best part would have to go to the animation. It's imaginative, it's creative, and has a scope to it. Even the character animation is beyond flawless.Before I end this review, there are some two problems that I do have. While the story's pretty decent and explains why the Boxtrolls came to live underneath Cheesebridge (the name of the setting for the film)perfectly, the ""fish-out-of-water"" cliché in a fantasy does make it formulaic at some parts and there are some moments where they felt a bit rushed. At least it makes up for it with some great comedy that would make you laugh your face off.While The Boxtrolls isn't without it's flaws, it does make up for it with some fantastic animation, some good characters, excellent voice acting, and like I said before, some great comedy which makes this an entertainment value for anyone. To those who haven't seen it, I think you should check it out."
121,The Boxtrolls,7,3 November 2014,Clay Boxes,"I really wasn't too sure of what to expect here as this genre somehow usually escapes me and is not as predictable as most traditional family/animated films. ""The Pirates! Band of Misfits"" was very similar in the way it took the audience through a voyage that one would not typically predict and one not typical for most animated movies. There is humor present here as we watch the Boxtrolls get hunted by a couple of goons who are not very intelligent. The look at the wasted leadership of the royal figureheads is interesting as well, as they never quite have admirable qualities and cannot see or understand obvious things even though they are right in front of them. That being said, there is a story here that is amusing. The boy with the trolls, who is abandoned as a child, and somehow finds purpose and family is not a wasted story. The movie does lag a bit at times, and I wish there was less royalty and more trolls. The ending does go on for a bit at times, and the filler becomes just that, extra, unneeded fanfare."
122,The Boxtrolls,6,12 October 2014,"Slightly underwhelming, but definitely worth your time.","My immediate memories of ""Boxtrolls"" are warm ones and because of the terrific visuals, I recommend you check it out. It is, however, a film that really needed some punch-up in the comedic dialog so it's not going to automatically earn itself a spot in your Blu-ray collection, even if you are a hardcore fan of stop-motion. The story is set in the cheese-obsessed city of Cheesebridge, where, at night the Boxtrolls roam. Boxtrolls are small creatures, about a foot and a half in height that love to tinker with metal objects and mechanisms, eat bugs, hide underground and wear boxes for clothing. The boxes double-up as camouflage when they are above ground and need to hide. When the film begins, Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) announces Lord Portley-Rind (voiced by Jared Harris) that the Boxtrolls have kidnapped a human child so that they can eat him. Portley-Rind makes a deal with Snatcher: If he can get rid of the entire population of Boxtrolls, he will earn himself a prestigious white hat and a spot at the city elite's cheese-tasting table. Soon everyone is fearful of the Boxtrolls. Unbeknownst to them however is that the kidnapped child has not been eaten at all. The young boy (voiced by Isaac Hempstead-Wright) is being raised by the Boxtrolls, who name him Eggs (after the box he wears). Over the years, Snatcher and his cronies capture numerous Boxtrolls and is getting closer to his much desired white hat (to the dismay of portly-Rind). Eggs finds himself befriending Winnie (voiced by Elle Fanning), the neglected daughter of Lord Portley-Rind. The two of them seek to rescue the Boxtrolls from Snatcher's clutches.It almost goes without saying with these stop-motion films, but the visuals here are spectacular. Every character looks unique, every background is lush and full of life, every frame is a wonder to behold. The animation is just the right mix of fluid, but still delightfully model-like so you don't confuse it with the overabundant CG animation that is dominating children's animated films. The movie looks gorgeous in a way that no fully computer-generated film could and on top of that, the 3D is pretty solid as well. Even after the film is finished, you will have the character designs firmly imprinted into your mind. It's the case with pretty much every stop-motion film we've seen since the days of Ray Harryhausen, but that doesn't make it any less special. In a world where hand-animated films are becoming increasingly scarce, the craftsmanship and skill required to put a film like ""Boxtrolls"" together deserves to be revered.There is more to the film than just the art style, but I will save that for later because I want to address the biggest flaw in the film. The problem with ""Boxtrolls"" is that it isn't nearly as funny as it should be. There are some laughs, two big laughs that are memorable, but mostly it's just a few chuckles here and there. From the concept you would think that this film would be a riot. The film is filled with cheese puns, which aren't that funny really, some fish-out-of-water jokes that are just alright and some self-referential humor from two of Snatcher's henchmen that are pretty clever but will go way over the heads of the younger audience members attending. It's too bad because the film is a bit more edgy than your standard family-friendly movie but the writing just isn't that good overall. You end up with a film that doesn't have many darling ""aww"" moments, some decent sequences of adventuring and not a whole lot of laughs.Despite this weakness, the film is worth your while. The story is inventive, the characters interesting, the visuals very strong and while you won't necessarily be laughing your pants off, you will enjoy yourself. When it comes to the driving forces behind the characters, they're not simple, they're actually as complex as a film where every street is named after a type of cheese allows. Take the villain for example. He wants to capture the Boxtrolls in order to move up in the aristocracy of the town. He doesn't just hate the trolls for no reason; he just sees them as a means to an end. Yes he's a villain, and an obvious one because to him the ends justify the means, but the man he is trying to manipulate, the mayor is also kind of a jerk. The guy is so obsessed with his political image and cheese that he essentially neglects his daughter so you don't really blame the bad guy for resenting him. Even our heroes are not just bland black-and-whites. Winnie, for example, has a bit of a sadistic streak to her. The Boxtrolls themselves are a lot of fun to watch and manage to stand out from each other not only because of their distinct physical features, but also because of the way they act. The film is flawed but there is more here that works than doesn't.It's unlikely that ""Boxtrolls"" will become a family favorite that will be watched over and over in years to come, but that's OK. It's a decent way to spend some time with your family and your kids; or just by yourself if you're into stop-motion animation. I'm not going to lie. I was hoping the film would be better than it was, but that does not mean that I didn't laugh or that I wasn't excited as the plot unfolded. The ending is particularly strong because it takes some real chances and the bits that were funny and exciting were quite funny and exciting. Children will, in particular appreciate the overall results. ""Boxtrolls"" is good, but not great family entertainment for slightly older children and for adults that like animation. (3-D Theatrical version on the big screen, October 2, 2014)"
123,The Boxtrolls,,11 October 2014,Pretty good,"Not nearly as good as 2012's Paranorman, but still solid enough (for those wondering why the comparison, they're from the same studio). The animation is nice, even if at times slightly underwhelming in its use of colors and its camera-work. The storyline is pretty straight-forward, if maybe a little too formulaic without any real hints at breaking the formula. Still, it's a nice experience for what its worth, although I'm not sure just how much children will really like it. I feel like a lot of children will be sort of restless, since it's also not as colorful and bright as they're usually used to and not as dark and acessible for older people like Coraline or Paranorman were."
124,The Boxtrolls,6,6 October 2014,Laika's Worst is Still Worth a Watch,"Laika studios have built their young legacy on uniquely gorgeous and strangely macabre children's movies, carefully crafting odd but undeniably beautiful stop-motion pictures. The Boxtrolls, in many ways, sits comfortably on their shelf, with lively cinematography, dark characters, and light humor. That said, Boxtrolls is far and away their least successful outing. The oddities here are neither fun enough (i.e. Paranorman) nor gorgeous enough (i.e. Coraline) to warrant its bipolar strangeness/mainstream-ness. Nonetheless, there is plenty of technical and artistic spectacle that helps it outshine the problems. The world of Boxtrolls is a unique one: above the ground is a city of cheese-loving aristocrats who live in a constant fear ofreally anything. Under the ground is the city of the boxtrolls, a community of innocent dark-Despicable-Me-minions who dress in cardboard boxes and go above ground to gather supplies. It's a fascinating universe, that when not struggling with heavy handed messages and undeserved character arcs, is full of funny idiosyncrasies, steam punk sensibilities, and fish-out-of-water goodness. The villains are the standouts; non-sequitur, bumbling, and wholly entertaining, they breathe a complexly funny bit of self-evaluation to the proceedings that you rarely see in kids films. Herein lies another issue: who is this movie for? The childish wit and adult tones don't gel evenly. It dabbles in silly characters and dumb cheese puns for kids, but also has plenty of darkly irreverent and even off-putting sexual humor. Unevenness aside, Boxtrolls is still an achievement in style and a somewhat-worthy addition to Laika's canon."
125,The Boxtrolls,7,4 October 2014,Where The Cute Trolls Are,"I think everyone can enjoy this movie regardless of age. Boxtrolls can not speak usual language which we use every day but I could understand what they said seeing their face expressions and hearing the tone of their voices. I like the behavior of each box-trolls because it was so cute. My favorite scene in the movie is when Eggs who was the main character and Fish who was the foster father of Eggs were singing along to music of a newly found record. Because I felt a deep connection they had in the scene. Also, it was a heartwarming scene for me. Not only the plot was interesting, the features of the characters and props were also fascinating. They had used beautiful visual effects to describe them that's why I felt they were quite real. It was the first time for me to watch a 3D movie and I really enjoyed it."
