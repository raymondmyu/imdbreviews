0,Fantastic Planet,9,12 April 2001,Brings back great memories,"What a great movie!  I had completely forgotten about this film -in fact, I hadn't seen it in over 20 years.  Well, I rented 'The Cell' and while I was watching the scene where Jennifer Lopez is in her house with the television on, I noticed those blue aliens and the memories came rushing back!  Of course, I came to IMDB to figure out what the title of the film was (it was in the trivia section of 'The Cell' review), and I was pleasantly surprised to find the title.  I went and bought the DVD, which is truly outstanding! The basic premise of the movie is that a race of aliens keeps domesticated humans as pets, while eliminating their feral brethren in the wild.  The story centers around Terr, who is rescued from a pack of cruel alien children by the daughter of a high-ranking official.  Eventually he runs away and ends up meeting the humans living in the wild.  They become tired of the treatment they suffer at the hands of the alien race, and seek to exact revenge on their captors.This movie was made nearly 30 years ago, so the animation is not really comparable to modern-day animation, but the story and the plot transcend time.  The premise of the film is as valid today as it was in the 70s.The DVD edition of the movie comes with three additional animated shorts by Rene Laloux, and they are just as entertaining.  This is a real gem of a movie...truly beautiful.  My kids love it as well.  A true masterpiece.9/10."
1,Fantastic Planet,10,8 October 2005,A masterpiece... still up-to-date,"In the world of the animation business there is a recent trends towards super- realism where computer graphics are being increasingly used. Although I appreciate animations like Finding Nemo or the Incredibles for they represent a renewal of the genre (in the same way the Disney movie did in the 50's), the artistic style of La Planete Sauvage is unmistakable and accords perfectly with the dark atmosphere of the movie. This animation is based on the book Oms (a deformation of the french word homme, man) from the French SciFi writer Stephan Wul who should also be credited for being the writer of The Time Masters (another SciFi animation worth your time). Wul's real name is still a mystery. The rare things we know about his life are that he wrote his 10 (or so) only books when he was studying dentistry at the University. He apparently graduated and became too busy to continue his writing activity. What a pity. I've read most of Wul's book and they are all unique and beautiful. The animation sticks true to Wul's vision. The art by the Czech master Topor is dark and oppressing, despite the bright color of the 60-70's-influenced graphism, adding to the uncomfort of seeing human beings treated as pets or pests by giant extraterrestrials. However, the roles are interchangeable and humans do behave too often in the way the extraterrestrials do in the movie with other living creatures on Earth. Hard to find but worth the search."
2,Fantastic Planet,9,8 January 2003,"Cult movie in France, not about future ... but about past ...","This is the masterpiece of René Laloux. Was an almost big success in France, was shown only 2 or 3 times in the past 20 years and is now a kind of ""Cult"" movie for sci fi addicts. This sci-fi movie is far much better than the two other from the same director: ""Gandahar"" and ""Les maitres du temps"" (Time Masters). René Laloux always works with great and original comics artists. He worked with ""Moebius"" Aka Jean Giraud on ""Les maitres du temps"". This artist is also credited on ""Alien"" , he created the space suits. He worked with ""Caza"" an other great comics artist for ""Gandahar""He worked wit ""Topor"" on ""La planète sauvage"". Roland Topor is a french artist with a great sense of fantasy. He designed most of all you can see on the screen. The animation was produced in Czechoslovakia because there always have been excellent animation studios in this country, and also because producing in France was far too expensive. This story takes place in the past. It is a metaphor of the man's history. The small characters are called ""Oms"". This word is pronounced like the french word ""Hommes"" that means ""man"". It tell us when man had to leave the original heaven. Man had to fight against his old masters to be independent and free, then he had to find his place in the universe. This is the universal story ... and that's why this movie is timeless (despite the 70s Wha Wha guitars ... ;o)"
3,Fantastic Planet,10,8 February 2000,Excellent sci-fi movie.,"La Planète sauvage is a fantastic sci-fi movie. The story is great. Its about a planet called Ygam, where human-like creatures called Oms live as pets for a race of blue giants known as the Traags. An Om steals a Traag knowledge device and helps the other Oms revolt. This is just the beginning of this fantastic tale. Even tough the animation is only okay, the fantastic drawings are perfectly suited to this exceptional movie. They are beautiful are alone worth the price(and time) that will give you the chance to see this extraordinary film, but the story is also exceptional. Its hard to find but its worth it.10 out of 10. An animation masterpiece."
4,Fantastic Planet,,16 October 2003,It's about using your noodle.,"I saw this movie a few years ago on the Sci-Fi channel during a movie marathon they were having.  Loved it so much I bought the DVD.Based on a brilliant piece of science fiction (""Oms En Serie"" by Stefan Wul).  The artwork is stunning, and the story line an original masterpiece.The plotline of this story is simple.You enslave a race of beings and take them for granted, one of them eventually learns your language, and unites all his fellow slaves in an organized attack.Suddenly you've been conquered.This story line was later ripped off by L. Ron Hubbard and his group of wackos.  You might have read the book, or seen the atrocity of a film ""Battlefield Earth""."
5,Fantastic Planet,10,3 August 1999,Fascinating...,"This film is an absolute marvel. I saw this film as a child, and was instantly mesmerized with the entire concept. Fans of dark animation will hopefully love it as did I. Eerie settings, strange creatures, and an equally hypnotic score all lend themselves to the masterpiece that is La Planete Sauvage."
6,Fantastic Planet,8,26 August 2014,Truly Bizarre,"Made in 1973, Fantastic Planet predates most mature animation. I think the only piece I've loved before this is Fantasia, three decades prior. But Fantastic Planet isn't just adult. Its also ambitious because of its surreal style. Fantastic Planet is one-of-a-kind, and freaking weird.We are in a sci-fi world. But nothing meets expectations. Humans are dominated by giant blue aliens, kept as pets. These Draags are more advanced than us, but their devices are strange, stuff that'd never be useful in real life. There's hardly a regular moment in the film. Funny clothing, strange customs, nefarious devices, disturbing flora and fauna. In terms of creativity, I believe this is #1.The other elements also compliment the style perfectly. The animation uses both traditional and stop-motion animation, giving the film a jerky pace. The soundtrack is pure 70s psychedelic. An appropriate tune for something impossible to fully comprehend. You get immersed in the experience.However, a fair warning - this movie is the epitome of style-over-substience. The characters are weak, and the message is ancillary at best. If the unusual style doesn't appeal to you, then move on. But for those who love the animated art, its something you need to see at least once."
7,Fantastic Planet,9,17 May 2009,""" It was possible to learn, the problem was,  did I want to ? ""","If when you view this film, you are expecting a simple cartoon, you are in for a surprise and an educational treat as well. The film is called "" Fantastic Planet "" and is perhaps one of the finest examples of creative journalism ever. It tells the story of Terr (Eric Baugin and Jean Valmont) who's life literally begins on the run. His mother, Indeed, the entire race of fleeing Humans are not the dominate species on the planet. Hardly, the Humans are tiny when compared with the giant size Draags who rule the world. On this Alien sphere, the Draags consider the little humans, whom they call Oms, both charming play toys and at the same time, a pesky, intrusive and troubling nuisance. After losing his mother, Terr is adopted and accepted as a household pet by a female Draag. Despite being little more than a toy, Terr is nevertheless able to learn enough to escape and eventually mature into an adult Om. Later he meets other Oms, one of which is called Tiwa (Jennifer Drake). As time passes, the Oms become so dangerous to the Draags, that they decide to eradicate the entire race of humans. However, the Oms, having become aware of the plan, hurry to find and exploit the Draags' one main weakness. Failure means extinction, success promises to change the world of both. The film is certainly unique and its moral offering is not lost on the thinking and compassionate viewer. Subtitles make for a hindrance, but it's importance message allows it to stand on its own laurels as an all time Classic. ****"
8,Fantastic Planet,,6 May 2006,A great adult animation,"I first saw this movie in back the '70s after cracking my ribs and having to take an enforced break from work. One afternoon I wandered into a movie theater and sat down to one of the most absorbing, memorable animations that I have ever seen. With the dawn of the internet, this was one of the first movies I looked up, to see if I could buy it.The philosophy may be shallow; downtrodden rise to overcome oppressors, but getting there is full of memorable tidbits. I loved the innocent child carelessly playing with the little Omm, I loved the society of the superior people with it's focus on intellectual pursuit, yet it's vulnerability to the oppressed little people that they generally underestimate and ignore. The fact that this was done as a cartoon helps not hinders. I have always remembered the blue people, and the music is well scored.This movie is for adults, who like the off-beat, and enjoy a little thought provoking entertainment."
9,Fantastic Planet,10,15 November 2004,"A race of superior beings who master knowledge through the use of technology , work is carried out by an inferior race of tiny slaves. Surrealistic scenarios and an excellent music","This sci-fi movie, has a curious and very strange plot that strikes you from the very beginning. You have a race of superior beings (Draags) who master all branches of knowledge through the use of technology which liberates them from work, work which is carried out by an inferior race of tiny human-like slaves (Oms). This exquisite story is backed up by extremely surrealistic scenarios and an excellent music. Animated characters representing this ruling race are well-conceived and far apart from stereotypes. You enter a weird world with a fantastic atmosphere which satisfies the most demanding whims of this genre's fans. Though the plots looks simple in appearance it is a clever political satire."
10,Fantastic Planet,10,28 July 2014,Animation Transcends Itself,"Rene Laloux's ""La Planete Sauvage"" refuses to disappear from the cinematic landscape, and for those who haven't seen it yet - lucky you! - it is hard at first to understand why. Certainly the film owes none of its longevity to any groundbreaking techniques, or star-packaging. It succeeds because of a constant, virtuoso tension between concept and execution, and as such, the beauty of the film is its refusal to give in to your expectations.Fantastic Planet sees mankind acting as either mere pets or vermin to a colossal race of blue humanoids. Upon reading this you'd expect to overlords to be cruel and arrogant, and they manage to be even more frightening by being relatively benign yet unfathomably different from us at the same time. Laloux refuses to judge the aliens, just as he refuses to romanticize the human lead, or his new comrades. A later attempt at extermination is treated with the cold detachment of pest control.Although it would actually be interesting to watch a gifted modern filmmaker have a go at this plot with a significant budget and contemporary technology, they would be hard-pressed to convey the level of unease primal dread conveyed by Laloux's deceptively simple visuals. The look is scarce but each touch hits its mark, whether it be the blank faces of the Draags, the skin-colored Bosch-inspired landscapes, or the weird vignettes of cruelty within the planet's warped animal kingdom. Add to that a dreamy score by Alain Goraguer and you end up with a film that, when it's unnerving you, is just balls-to-the-wall trippy.Over 40 years on, it is still refreshing to behold a film that sits at the polar opposite of the lushness of a Miyazaki or Disney, one that possibly jump-started the era of animation as a medium of ideas that would later give us the likes of Ghost in the Shell and Jin Roh. An enduring masterpiece, well worth the watch!"
11,Fantastic Planet,10,6 April 2012,Interesting perspective of old tales,"When I first saw Fantastic Planet as a child, the concept to me was revolutionary. Later on after this film was brought out, other similar stories surfaced.We see how other beings saw humans as lower life forms and how they underestimate human determination and the ability to quickly adapt to different variables. Some can see this story in multiple perspectives. Whether it is class separation and struggles, the freeing from slavery with the underdog now being able to reward themselves the fruits of their labor, the ants and grasshopper along with many other stories and themes.However I think this story also reflects some of the oldest stories mankind has thought about. Even as early as the Sumerian and/or Babylonian myths of the Anunnaki and the rebellions. Adam and Eve eating from the Tree of Knowledge then being cast out from the Garden of Eden. Along with other myths from Greeks and Romans. Understanding that to evolve as a species, one must have the education to further technology but at the same time not to be a slave and a lazy product of that technology or else that species would be a victim to which they just defeated whether if it is physical, mental, ideological and so forth.This animated film contains a multitude of concepts for which future similar stories can't fully capture.Its good for multiple age ranges and one can make it as easy or as complex as one sees fit"
12,Fantastic Planet,7,9 August 2011,A strange and wonderful animated gem,"Having just completed watching this film, I can say it was worth the wait. It will please fans of hard-core science fiction (not fantasy), and will seduce fans of animation (not just 3D animation, animation in general terms) with its mix of Czech style animation and illustration.It is a good movie, but not a masterpiece. The narrative treads the science fiction tropes too strictly and ends up painting characters and events predictably when the setup seems to suggest something more interesting. In fact, I was very disappointed that the most developed and interesting relationship in the whole film is traded off for a kind of boring resistance story that does its best to not let the audience make connections with the characters. It is not picked up or revisited later... and none of the subsequent character interplay is as interesting or meaningful.Where this film excels is in its weirdness and imagination. Strange and horrible creations are brought to life and move/eat/gestate/exist in ways that will make you go 'ew' and 'wow' at the same time. This is helped by the strong European styling of the animation (mostly limited in movement) and illustration, which reminded me of studio Zagreb..There is something so mysterious about the atmosphere of this film - it may just grab you. Definitely watch it for the disturbing and somehow touching relationship between Tiva and Terr - you'll only wish there was more of it."
13,Fantastic Planet,7,25 February 2011,Unique,"A delightful, original an odd French-Czechoslovakian animation movie by Rene Laloux that wan Cannes Jury's award in 1974.The 2-D animation is something that you can expect from the seventies, but it is very original and innovative for the time. It has the detail and charm of all good illustration books, and, despite the limits in movement, the characters are very expressive and beautifully drawn, as well as the landscapes. The world and atmospheres created by Laloux are superb, both familiar and strange. The Recipe? Mix Dali surreal landscapes, Bosch architecture and fauna/flora creatures, add a hint of 19th century botanical drawings, slowly pour some Pink Floyd-ish music, and whisk all energetically with a fat-free faux-mythological metaphorical story, and you have The Savage Planet, which is the original title of the movie in French.The story is very interesting and has many possible interpretations and readings: the role of humans in Nature, cohabitation and coexistence of different species and political systems, what makes different species superior and savage, among others. I found funny that the people in the story are called Oms (French word for people is Hommes and it sounds the same as Oms), and the main character is called Terr (the name of earth in French is Terre and sounds the same as Terr).The main problem with the story and the characters is that they are not always engaging as they don't transmit enough emotion or feeling to the viewer. The viewer doesn't feel empathy towards the poor suffering human pets or towards the aliens, the first because they really act like a pest, and the second because they are too spiritual and developed to tolerate others than themselves. This is all intended, but still frigidly expressed. The lack of thrill is what kills the movie.Nevertheless, this is one of those animation movies that everybody should see, full of imagination, talent, and landmarks in Animation. A cult movie that deserves the cult. Unique."
14,Fantastic Planet,10,31 August 2014,"Great sci-fi, great uncensored ideas, fantastic imagination","I was just watching a GoodBadFlicks video yesterday where the guy was laughing at US movie studios for buying film rights for some stories and foreign films that they could never ever present in the US for fear of protests. For me it was a strange proposal, why wouldn't they be able to show something raw, uncensored, original? The answer was obvious, but I am not going to dwell on that point.La Planete Sauvage is probably a movie in this category. The film is short, just over an hour, but from the very beginning it starts with something controversial: a woman carrying a baby is being teased by giant humanoids that have fingers the size of the woman. It turns out they are children, playing with the human as a human would play with an ant. They accidentally kill her and her baby is being taken as a pet by one of these giants. They are called Tragg and they consider humans animals, to be petted or exterminated as they please. The very first scenes are brutal to watch and that's why I think this would never sit well with a culture that values superiority more than anything else.You have to watch it in French, if you get the language, I had a dual French/English audio film with English subtitles and, even if I didn't go through the English audio, there is something about the French language that just naturally blends with the arrogant culture of the Traggs. The Tragg culture and their planet were truly spectacular. To think that in 1973 someone thought of a superior technological culture that is truly alien while remaining humanoid, and did it well, was amazing. The concepts hold true even now, in 2014!I have to say that I have been thinking of writing a story about humans treated as pets by an alien culture, but after I've seen this I couldn't possibly do it, as it is perfect as storyline and concepts. It also makes me think of another subject close to my heart: dogs. In Romania there are still a lot of vagabond dogs and the heartless and pointless discussions about exterminating them are very close to what the Tragg are doing when considering the human vermin. There are also some ideas about the ""wild human"" society that hit close to this concept of groups of people gathering around the mentality of the lowest common denominator. So, in my mind, to add valid philosophical and moral points to an already brilliant story with fantastic drawings is like covering the icing of the cake with a ton of cherries!About the animation style. This is something that made some people rate this film a lot lower than it deserves. Are you aware that it was made in 1973, by Czech animators? Actually, besides the voice actors and the wonderful director René Laloux, there were almost no French people in the production team. The animation in the Czech Republic is a reason for national pride, but the way they do it was unique and certainly different from the US, French and Japanese animation styles. OK, so maybe you prefer the animation style of Robin Hood, with the animals, but really, this is so much better in so many ways that I couldn't possibly get snagged on animation.Bottom line: The imagination, the way it just threw out there idea after idea, no matter how uncomfortable, the storyline, the amazing creatures, the weird ways in which they were killing people... it was true sci-fi. The real thing! Watch this! It will take an hour of your life, big deal! You will see that your brain will churn all of those ideas for a while after watching the film. It will feel like a strange but amazing flavor on your tongue. Top rating!"
15,Fantastic Planet,9,27 March 2011,Very unique!,"I am a huge fan of animated movies and I love Fantastic Planet. For any fans of animation or sci-fi, Fantastic Planet is very ideal in both instances. For one thing I loved how unique it was, and the storytelling is mostly to thank for that. The story is an original one, and holds some very interesting concepts without preaching.Also engaging are the characters. They are simple, but you do empathise with them especially Terr who moved me rightly from minute one. The animation is by far the best asset, it is absolutely fantastic, with beautiful backgrounds, stunning colours and well-modelled characters. The music is beautiful, poignant and haunting as well and the writing is top notch.The voice acting does very well to fit with the characters and it is also sensitive and also succeeds in making the characters even more likable than they are. The English dubbing is good, but I find the original one more emotive and poetic. In fact, my only gripe with Fantastic Planet is that there are times when it does drag, but overall it is a unique and quite fantastic film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
16,Fantastic Planet,7,29 October 2007,Well-known French psychedelic animation,"Animations like this are quite rare, especially after Disney created a near monopoly on animation circuit (something that, despite the high quality of their animations in general, nevertheless lead to one of the world's most frustrating assumptions: that ""cartoons"" are solely for kids). This is a surrealist French animation from the 70s, and that's pretty much the sum-up of its description: Surreal, 70s, and French.""Fantastic Planet"" is a science fiction film about a world inhabited by Traags (large blue alien species) and Oms (human creatures that are regarded as pests and pets by the colossal Traags), along with other interesting and bizarre creatures like something out of Dr. Seuss. The Traags aren't necessarily evil, though they're the antagonists. They treat the Oms just like humans treat mice, as pests and occasionally pets, and the depictions of the Traags' treatments of their pets really is not that far removed from how humans truly do treat their pets as well. One Om, Terr, manages to escape from his Traag mistress and steal her ""headphones"" which help imprint all of Traag knowledge. He meets up with wild Oms and, with the headphone device, manages to create an uprising against the Traags.Not only psychedelic, the intent was political in nature, though by these days the movie has toned down a bit. It is in fact a really pretty animation because of its use of colors and design, which for me is a lot more interesting than its historical value. For fans of animation of different types, it's a must see, but also for those who crave the underground psychedelic aspects of the 70s era and have worn out their DVDs of Fritz the Cat and The Yellow Submarine, this provides a charming alternative.--PolarisDiB"
17,Fantastic Planet,10,11 July 2005,Great film; encourages the mind to wander.,"The first time I saw this film I was taken by curiosity. I love to speculate and this film sent my mind reeling. It takes place on an alien planet where the ""giants"" rule and keep ""oms"" as pets. The ""giants"" are large blue alien creatures that somewhat resemble humans as well as the ""idols"" of the Aztec and Incan period. The ""oms"" are humans, which are either domestic or wild. The problem with the ""oms"" is that they reproduce like roaches. When Tiwa, a young giant girl, adopts an ""om"" and becomes quite fond of him, she carries him with her always. Tiwa's father gives her an electromagnetic collar with remote for her ""om"" so that when he flees from her, she can pull him back by the use of her remote control. The method of learning for these ""giants"" is by listening to the ""knowledge headphones,"" and since Tiwa's ""om"" has on this special collar, he, too, receives all of the knowledge that Tiwa does from the headphones. He soon becomes fluent in the ""giants"" language and learns of their hideous plan to wipe out the wild ""oms."" He escapes Tiwa's care and steals the headphones. He seeks the wild ""oms"" and shares the knowledge from the headphones with the ""om"" tribes. There is a battle between ""giants"" and ""oms,"" and the details included are quite enthralling. Personally, I found that the original french-speaking version with subtitles was more entertaining and authentic than the English dubbed version. It is a great film for all ages and will be received on different levels for everyone."
18,Fantastic Planet,7,9 July 2000,Animation with a very large brain,"A very interesting political parable, apparently intended as an allegory on Czechislovakia's struggle against the Russians.  But like any good allegory, it works as a statement on any struggle to topple a giant.The art and animation are superb, filled with more detail and imagination than any ten standard animated films (the works of Miyazaki excluded).It isn't perfect, of course.  For all it's visual and allegorical depth, the characters are about as deep as a glass of water, existing only to deliver lines which further the plot. In fact, the main character practically disappears during the final act. Additionally, while the sights of alien plant and animal life show a great deal of creativity, we are treated to far too many of them.  Such sequences are great for establishing a sense of place, but should have been cut closer to the end of the film.As an interesting final note, the theme of knowledge overcoming power, and particularly the use of a ""knowledge machine"" suspiciously appeared later in L. Ron Hubbard's ""Battlefield Earth"", giving us one less reason to retain any respect for the man."
19,Fantastic Planet,7,31 January 2017,And now for something completely different...,"The animation has been compared a lot of Terry Gilliam's animations from Monty Python. But I found the visuals here more interesting and original rather than disturbing with what I mostly remember were bad and distasteful visual puns.Not saying this film is on par with Gilliam's work as a film director. It's better than Tideland though... The animations were made with a low budget and rather static but do what they're supposed to do with only one part that is too repetitive (with the cannons). Imaginative design makes up for sometimes crudely drawn characters. The drawing style has a certain old-fashioned quality to it at times, as if you're watching an illustrated children's bible (but with some boob hanging out here and there and some violence that could give some kids nightmares). Beware, it's an adult film.You won't find another movie like this anywhere and I can recommend this trippy, laid back psychedelic experience. It's mind-expanding without the need for substance abuse!"
20,Fantastic Planet,7,2 February 2012,Where dreams of freedom assume giant proportions.,"I'm not much of a fan of fantasy. A friend, however, brought this film to my attention because he said he couldn't get the story out of his head, and made further comments that piqued my curiosity.Well, it didn't kill me to see the film and I'm happy to say that it was worth my time  for a number of reasons. First, the mise-en-scene is quite imaginative with absolutely surreal environments that I think owe a lot to the imagery of Monty Python; nothing wrong in copying  everybody does it, anyway.Second, it's a fairly simple story about the oppression and exploitation of the masses in a fantastic society somewhere in the cosmos. To that extent, it's an allegory for any situation that results in a clash between opposing cultures, different societies and so on. It's given a new slant here, though, by portraying humanity  called the Oms  as the oppressed who are exploited by blue giants, known as the Traag. The plot follows the exploits of one male Om who, after learning all about the Traag, escapes from them to rouse the other Oms to mount a rebellion.Finally, however, the most intriguing aspect about this film is the clear connection between it and other sci-fi and fantasy films. For example, the discordant sounds in this film are, I think, a direct copy of those I heard in The Forbidden Planet (1957). As noted already, the whole scenario owes much to the Monty Python TV series. And for sure, I think, James Cameron copied the idea of a giant tree sanctuary from this film for inclusion in his epic Avatar (2009). Cameron, of course, reversed the oppressed-oppressor roles of humanity and the blue giants for his story.Moreover, here's a way-out thought: being a French production and seeing as how the French just love Hollywood westerns, I was amused to see the 'outlaw' Oms run for cover to a tiny hole in a wall  a long, blank, gigantic solid wall  much like how the real Butch Cassidy and his outlaws retreated to what was known as The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang hideout in the late nineteenth century. Too much of a stretch for you? Then think about why the writers here also included a Hollow Bush Gang of Oms who acted as enemies of the rebellious Oms in the Tree of Life sanctuary who wanted to escape from the Traag.Actually, I also think that The Hollow Bush Gang is a metaphor for the Gang with No Brains, as you will see  in contrast to the rebellious Oms who figured out how to escape from Traag domination. Knowledge, after all, is power and so forth...And, for something even more off the wall: long ago, Edgar Rice Burroughs (famous for Tarzan and others) wrote sci-fi stories about Mars. In one of those stories, there were headless humanoids that could function only when a head slithered into position between the shoulders. So watch for a brazen copy of that idea in this film.I guess kids today would find the graphics and imagery quite rudimentary when compared to the current technology of mind-blowing CGI action. Too bad  their loss.If you ever come across it on TV or on DVD, you could do lot worse with a couple of your hours, I guess. As a piece of cinema history, it is worth seeing; and I'm glad I did.Give it seven stars for the imagery and overall effort.January 26, 2012"
21,Fantastic Planet,6,23 July 1999,Weird Science,"This movie is a pioneer. One of the first feature-length animated movies dedicated to adults and science fiction. The fantasy world in this movie could've only been made possible in animation without spending a ton of money.
The story's about a planet where humans aren't the dominant species, being captured and domesticated. The human capacity to think and learn eventually turn the pets into pests, leading to the eternal human struggle for freedom.The animation itself is nothing to get crazy about, but the psychedelic images reminds you of the futuristic LP covers of such bands like Journey, Boston and Yes.I would like to see more work like this being produced in countries other than Japan. Is a refreshing new view of the yet untapped potential of animation."
22,Fantastic Planet,,25 January 2006,Frustrating Planet,"There's a school of science fiction -- the old school -- that governs how these things are put together. First you take some social injustice or quirk of the times. Then you cast into the future or some fantasy realm with exaggerations in a sort of exploration. In the worst case, its satire. In the very best, say Phil Dick, it can be an open essay on selfawareness.Then of course, there's the third step, all the elaborations of this fantasy or future world. Again, there's the worst case where they merely amuse and give the general feeling of otherworldliness. And the best case where each detail of the world somehow elaborates on the curlicues of the essay.What we have here is the worst case in the first two, but done well. We have the kind of obvious, blunt social problem that only an enslaved people would think worthy of elaboration. We have that elaboration similarly bluntly: two races, blind conflict, etc. Its all at the ""Animal Farm"" level, which is to say the fifth grade. Just recalling it has a dumbing effect.It is in the third component that this is interesting. Czechs are not strong thinkers when they encounter something directly. They slide in from the side. Its those side things that cut. Even Kafka. His supposedly big ideas, the obvious ones are only a disguise for all the concept fleas he is able to carry on them.And all those notions are visual here, purely cinematic, which is a joy. In fact, its better to watch this in a different language than you speak. You won't miss anything story-wise and be able to focus on some of the visual notions tried out here.Not all of them impress of course: for instance there's the bizarre case of the gremlin in a cage that catches birds with its tongue, shakes them dead and discards them. The area is strewn with these corpses, blossomlike while the gremlin giggles. Some guy came to work one day with this idea and nailed it in wherever.But there are other visual notions that strike. The advanced race indulges in group meditations where manipulative stingers come from the walls of the room and literally mix their bodies. That by itself is pretty strong. Whether group conceptsex or individual, little bubbles or mind-souls drift out of their bodies to the heavens, literally a moon (their ""Fantastic Planet"") There, these mindbubbles join with huge headless robots with the specific purpose of having sex (which is shown as ""dancing""). This is also how they reproduce, by mechanisms not explained. The idea is so visual, so rich, so strangely evocative it makes this otherwise dreary thing worth watching.Apparently it is often paired with ""Yellow Submarine"" which has none of the fleas.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
23,Fantastic Planet,2,10 June 2012,Convoluted mess!,"I vaguely remember seeing this animated sci-fi tale on Cable TV many years ago. As I was young at the time I was perpetually bored and disappointed in its inability to develop any suspense adequate enough to hold my attention. Lo and behold, I come across this while browsing Youtube. Since I love mystical animation my intrigue led me to watch this full length feature.Cool animation cannot save this story due to an incoherent plot with inexplicable characters, creepy-cool creatures and surreal imagery. Apparently, this is a parable designed to serve as a morality tale against societal supremacy practiced by groups. But this heavy-handed interpretation is too simplistic and moronic to be able to tackle such a complex subject of bigotry and conflict between people, let alone fictitious creatures. As a child, I was left with that empty feeling one gets when they may be too naive or young to comprehend the hidden messages of an intellectual fable. But perhaps I was more wise than I gave myself credit for as a youth.Fantastic Planet attempts to use parallels of oppression reminiscent of Nazi Germany and White colonialism, but we are left with platitudes that can only be pitched to the lowest common mindset for biased and uninformed minds. There is also some unnecessary usage of nudity that hasn't any purpose but to titillate older viewers, thus alienating and humiliating a child audience. This 72 minute excursion into a lower surreal world of horror drags along at a pretty deliberate pace that proves the lack of content cannot uphold a feature length film. This film also has an overall sinister feeling that only puts off an engaged viewer."
24,Fantastic Planet,9,17 December 2008,I remember the 1973 trailer,"It scared me to pieces (well I was 11 years old) as well as never forgetting it. I got in my early twenties I started wondering how I can get to see it and was it really as creepy as I remembered.Long story short. While I was in this VHS club saw they were offering the Englis version (no subtitles) and nabbed it. The music in the opening credits put me off--O groan dated! And then I started watching; dated nothing, it's a perfect fit. It heightens the bizarre atmosphere and in particular the strange animals and plant life. At certain points I found my attention taken from the conflict between the Oms and their giant oppressors in order not to lose sight of when something wild would happen in the background. It could have been a major distraction but as with the soundtrack it enhanced the memorable weirdness."
25,Fantastic Planet,10,17 January 2008,"one of the trippiest things you'll ever see, bar none, and it's extraordinary in its simplicity","Fantastic Planet has about a hundredth of the technical proficiency- or just money- that any given Pixar film might have in just its first couple of reels. But there's probably just as much invention and eye-popping mind-blowing madness, if not exponentially more-so, than any recent CGI film. It's, well, art. Yes, to throw a word as big and all-encompassing like that is tricky, Fantastic Planet qualifies as some kind of weird artistic feat of surrealism and pure science fiction. And by sci-fi I mean the cream of the crop in storytelling and ideas: it's about the impact of images in a strange land being somehow completely relatable, if only in social construct or satirical forms, as though we were witnessing Gullivers Travels mixed around with Dune and then filtered through some renegade animator that got through the gates at a studio and churned something out fast. It's like a strange revelation that won't leave your mind.And yes, leave no mistake, it also works very well as a ""stoner movie"", one of those ridiculously warped visions that goes into the world of the imagination so heavily, with tangential moments in scenes (the 'blending' of the Draags in one scene, the constant flow of various monsters, the 'mating' ritual, the de-Oming), with a soundtrack that's like a outstanding, unlikely collaboration between Isaac Hayes and Pink Floyd (you don't know whether it'll split into Dark Side or Shaft). Premise is simple: a little oprhaned Om named Terr is taken in as a 'pet' of Tiwa, and is half tortured half loved by her. But, as case happens, she outgrows him, and he runs away after being filled with knowledge by some machine. Then he gets sucked into the underground world of the Oms, where there's lots of mating and other activities, such as fights (wacko scene with those teeth-filled monsters strapped on like Gonzo gladiators). But their civilization is in peril, and it's time to fight back! Lots of classic myths pumped in, but at times you almost forget there's story, which might be half the point. The director Rene Laloux, along with collaborators like Roland Topor, creates a world unequivocally unto itself, where there are real strokes with pencils and colors and inks, where it seems very much like a collection of pictures from some obscure European fable book for kids, only loaded with some kind of life-force that moves like no other animated film (maybe it's slightest, closest-distant relative is Yellow Submarine, which is still a stretch). Characters move in and out occasionally like a Terry Gilliam short- giant hand and other objects placed in almost jokingly, which makes it a lot of fun at times- and there's something eerie in Laloux's dedication to pushing the expectation-level, mainly because, as noted, we haven't seen this style before. It's a quiet form of sensationalism, where it sneaks up on the viewer, and then takes over a scene, growing little by little, like some weird plant.In short, he does his job as a genre director, probably on par with the great visionaries, while using some primitive methods of animation. But through imperfections there's more expressive tendencies, moments of chance and random visions like a monster springing organically about to eat another, or to go through bizarre mating rituals as Venus de Milo statues with blue heads. Or, in other words, as my long-winded adulation goes to say, a superb ""stoner movie"". Not that being sober will make you absorbed any less; it's a compliment, in a sense, that in its glory of its time it reaches a true cult impulse, where children can enjoy its wonderful glimpses of the ""fantastic"", and adults can have another more mature, thought-provoking input in its implications on power and human nature."
26,Fantastic Planet,9,20 July 2005,A bizarre animated Sci-Fi extravaganza!,"""Fantastic Planet"" may be one of the strangest animated films ever made. Roland Topor was known for his strange drawings, and this film was a great place to display his work. If Salvador Dali were to of had the chance to create an animated film, like he was originally promised by Disney, this is what it might look like. In the movie, a planet is ruled by large blue giants. The tiny people, the Oms closely resemble humans. The giants mistreat the Oms and make them their pets. Representational of class struggle. Also, the film is symbolic of Russia's treatment of Czechoslovakia at the time. The film caused much controversy when it was being made in the Czech Republic, so they had to move production to France. The film was very successful at the 1973 Cannes film festival. ""Fantastic Planet"" contains an amazing and bizarre musical score, sounding almost like Pink Floyd. There's also some weird alien creatures and psychedelic freak-out scenes. Although the film is PG, it contains cartoon nudity and violence. I don't think this film would get a PG now days. Artist Roland Topor was also a member of the Panic movement which also included Alejandro Jodorowsky and Fernando Arrabal. As far as an animated feature goes, ""Fantastic Planet"" is on a planet of its own. It's a surreal sci-fi trip, Man!!!"
27,Fantastic Planet,,6 November 2001,One of the best sci-fi cartoon movies ever,"I remember the first time i saw""Fantastic Planet"".It was December of 1986 on the USA Network.It was part of a saturday night kids show double feature with""Yellow Submarine"".Needless to say i was very young at that time,i thought it was weird and fun at the same time.I did'nt see it again until 10 years later in 1996 i rented it and loved every minute of it.I still see it once and a while on midnight cult TV showings on KQED or KOFY.I wish HBO showed it at least 2 or 3 times a month.The film is kind of an animated ""Planet Of The Apes"",it follows a little part of the same plot idea.Aliens dominating humans in the future works very well in some cases and this is one of them.Barry Bostwick narrates this film,ironically since it's a french film.All in all,""Fantastic Planet""is classic cult animated film that should be shown on TV alot.I give it a 8 of 10."
28,Fantastic Planet,10,25 December 2003,a fun trip,"i remember seeing this movie for the first time in the mid 80s, on USA network's late-night show called 'night flights' (the predecessor to USA's up all night), where they would show new-wave music videos and juxtapose them with cult movies like the fantastic planet or ringo star's cave man. FP is usually pretty easy to find nowadays, and if you can get a decent copy, definitely enjoy the psychedelic soundtrack and neat old-school sound effects. some of the landscapes are beautifully surreal, and strangely cruel, though sometimes in a humorous way."
29,Fantastic Planet,6,31 March 2003,"Highly imaginative, but obscure.","This animated film is a feast of imagination, filled with bizarre images and creatures....but, like most mainly visual films, it cannot sustain your complete attention, even for only 70 minutes. Yes, it's an allegory, that much is clear, but sometimes you feel as if you need a guidebook to interpret the symbols. Still, any fan of adult animation should watch this once.    (**1/2)"
30,Fantastic Planet,10,16 September 2002,Beautiful - a masterpiece,"Science fiction is the perfect genre for animation. Unfortunately, very few films have taken full advantage of that. Fantastic Planet, though, uses the medium to its fullest extent. It is, without a doubt, one of the most imaginative films ever created. The animation is simple, with few drawings per second, but those drawings are gorgeous. A gigantic, blue alien race has brought members of the human species to their planet. We're the size of insects to them. Some humans, Oms, as they're called, are kept as pets, while others are wild. Terr, the hero of the film, is a tame Om. Eventually he escapes and joins a tribe of wild Oms. The aliens eventually realize that the Oms can be a threat to them, and begin to exterminate them. The film is filled to the brim with remarkable images, bizarre forms of life and odd landscapes, weird customs and events impossible to understand. Most other science fiction films, animated or otherwise, stop so far below Fantastic Planet. Personally, I think it's one of the best films I've ever seen. 10/10."
31,Fantastic Planet,7,31 January 2014,Stunningly imaginative,"Having originally seen this movie back in the '70s, I remembered nothing about it except that it had weird creatures doing strange things. I had no memory of a story, or of people, or of dialogue; just strange creatures.Having just watched it again, I see there's this whole story with giants and transported earthlings, and a tale of struggle, but I probably will forget all that again, because it's so less memorable than the incredibly strange and imaginative details of a very unique world.As for the story, well, it's pretty interesting. This giant blue people keep humans, who to them are smaller than mice, as pets. The movie focuses on one giant girl and her pet human, and the movie beautifully conveys the weird mix of love and casual cruelty children can show their pets. As a human, one's sympathy is natural with the humans, but I wouldn't say the giants were evil; to them, humans are pretty much like rodents are to us, and while they think the humans might be intelligent, or at least their ancestors were, they aren't sure.The more allegorical elements feel a little flat, and the English dub suffers from weak acting, and if you're used to Pixar and Disney, the very simple animation can sometimes seem a little underwhelming, but the imagination is so strong that no fan of animation should miss this."
32,Fantastic Planet,,5 October 2004,amazing,"Perhaps the person that saw that movie simply didn't undersstand it. It i quiet amazing in terms of looking at issues that can be related to this world on many different levels, it is understandable, there is no particular physical plot, but it does include many details and it is amazingly done, it relates to today's world in almost the same way as ""Brave New World"", paralleling human approach to life, with its subjectivity, misunderstandings, spiritual phylosophies and concepts that are present in pagan, eastern, and the true Christian religion as opposed to blind belief of it. It takes a lot of attention and appreciation of humanity to watch and love it, but I recommend it to anyone who is concerned and is passionately in love with this world. It deals with subjective and objective beliefs that exist in todays world. This movie is beautiful, the art, the different levels ofconsciousness and understanding in which it can be seen, this movie is madeto make you think, not show you a story line. People who appreciate Bob Dylan I think would enjoy this movie."
33,Fantastic Planet,,2 July 2003,Surreal 70s animation at it's best,"This film is one of many in the early 70s (Allegro Non Tropo, The 9 Lives of Fritz the Cat) that explored alternate animation styles. Surrealism is de rigeur for these flicks and they shouldn't be viewed by anyone looking for Scooby-Doo and Jetsons slapstick.The Online Film Critics actually rated this ABOVE Men In Black and Star Trek IV. If you like Heavy Metal (the magazine AND the movie) you probably have already seen this - if you haven't - RUN, don't walk, to your video store;)"
34,Fantastic Planet,9,7 June 2003,"Very, very good","I saw this movie for the first time when I was a teenager. I loved it, and I watched it again many times. As a poetry and sci-fi amateur it thrilled my imagination and as a painter, my eyes. What more can I say?If animation movies had lived up to that standard the world might be better now. Ok, maybe not but I told you, I AM a sci-fi fan!!"
35,Fantastic Planet,3,14 June 2004,In love with every frame of itself,"Belabored concept/social agenda flick. It alternates between being emotionally stunted and brayingly self-important. It combines cheap, 20s ad copy style drawing with ugly and annoying ""stylistic"" animation techniques to create a visual style that is unique, thank goodness. It does, perhaps on the plus side, have lots and lots of breasts. This meandering art-house hemorrhoid devotes an enormous amount of time to indulgent tangents that are neither interesting nor advance the plot in any way. Annoying, repetitive soundtrack and auditory background. Silly technobabble. The main themes have been dealt with in Science Fiction novels in a far better fashion. This is someone's prurient highschool daydream that should have ended with the notebook doodles it undoubtedly started with. What can I say, I hated it."
36,Fantastic Planet,8,6 March 2017,Trippy trip to another world,"Fantastic Planet is a French-Czechoslovakian animated science fiction film. The story is simple and allegorical (which is more obvious when the French origin of some of the names is considered): the tiny Oms are tolerated as pets but ultimately seen as vermin by the towering, spiritual Draags. The imagery is outstanding: colourful, stylized, imaginative, and surreal. Not surprisingly, the movie had a rep (at least in my circles) of being best watched while stoned. I remember seeing this in the theatres in the 70's (straight) and the final images of the dancing statues stuck with me for decades. Definitely worth watching, if only for the artful (albeit not very 'hard scientific') depiction of an alien world. Note: the animated humanoid characters are frequently partially nude."
37,Fantastic Planet,8,5 March 2017,compelling new world,Humans had been brought to the alien world Ygam. They are the diminutive pets to giant blue people Draags who call them Oms. A mother and baby are on the run. Children Draags 'play' with them until the mother dies. Master Sinh finds the baby and his daughter Tiwa adopts it as her pet calling him Terr. He is able to gain knowledge while Tiwa is learning. Terr escapes stealing Tiwa's learning headset. He finds a tribe of wild Oms living in a tree.It's a fascinating alien world. It's surreal and threatening. The animation is strictly 70s. The Draags are alien unlike any other. The tribulations of the humans are compelling. This works as a thriller and as a lesson in humanity. The ending is a little rushed. It needs a scene between Tiwa and Terr. They are the ones who need to come to a final peace.
38,Fantastic Planet,9,22 November 2016,"An odd, beautiful, twisted classic","Almost everything about Fantastic Planet is weird. The premise is weird, the designs are weird, the environments are weird, and even the animation style is weird. And that's why I love it. It's surreal, creative, and incredible from start to finish. I love the designs of the characters, creatures, and environments, and I love the bizarre animation style. As for the plot/premise, I believe it serves as a good metaphor for how we treat animals. I also enjoyed the voice acting in the English dub, for the Draags in particular. Their monotone voices perfectly fit their near soulless facial expressions, and give off a somewhat unsettling vibe. Personally, I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loves surrealist art, animation, or or who simply wants to see a much more different animated film than most that come out."
39,Fantastic Planet,8,20 July 2016,Offbeat and thought provoking,"The tiny human-like Oms are treated as pets and totally at the mercy of intellectual blue giants the Draags. However, domesticated Om Terr manages to escape from his Draag master Tiwa and joins up with a tribe of wild Oms who Terr encourages to learn all about the Oms and their culture with the help of a special learning device.Director/co-writer Rene Laloux and co-writer Roland Topor use the quirky and compelling premise as a means to state a powerful message not only on the intrinsic evil and cruelty of one race totally subjugating another race (the de-Om sequence with numerous Oms being slaughtered in mass volume is genuinely nightmarish and disturbing), but also on how enlightenment and liberation go hand in hand. The Draags register well as a convincingly odd extraterrestrial race. Moreover, the vivid and fascinating depiction of a hostile planet populated by all kinds of dangerous and predatory creatures rates as this film's key triumph. The nifty stylized animation offers a wealth of striking and surreal images. Alain Goraguer's funky-digging score hits the right-on groovy spot. Although slightly marred by an annoying abrupt conclusion, this film still overall deserves its cult status."
40,Fantastic Planet,8,24 January 2015,Timeless  tale on power and more,"I was 12 when I first saw this UFO of a movie in Paris in a beautiful, vast old theatre with a chandelier in the middle of the room back in the early 80s. The blue humanoid alien on the poster had intrigued me and it had good ratings so I went in not having a clue what to expect, but I liked science-fiction in general so in I went on my own. Having recently watched it again, the fascination it exerted on me back then rushed back, only with more insights into the different possible levels of interpretation of the story. What I had only perceived at first as a very conventional tale of struggle between races for independence and power is also the start of more thoughts about other layers of interpretation, some maybe only in my imagination but still interesting to pursue in their own right, which is a lot more than your average Hollywood sci-fi big budget production can provoke.The extermination scenes with the big ball squashing humans like ants were very distressing for me as they echoed other, very ugly and real scenes from WWII I had seen before. The ""can't we all get along"" theme is the obvious first level of interpretation. Beyond this politically-correct view, there are other potential interpretations.The first level : Race. Enslaving inferior sentient beings is wrong and will come back to bite you in the ass when they get an education and organize themselves to fight.The second level : Politics. The superior blue aliens are the masters and humans the slaves. That they are considered in the movie mere pets or vermin is even more odious but serves to stir deep feelings and pure fear in the viewer (""what if aliens showed up tomorrow and treated us the same way?"" - a few horror movies have used this theme to great effect). This class-struggle allegory is flagrant to me and is typical of the moral indignation that exploitation and injustice spark in anyone who has a conscience. Beyond this, the film shows that the only way out of oppression is education and fighting physically for independence and respect from the so-called 'superiors'. In this the message becomes universal but not very original. From both extremes comes the argument that it is a fight to the death, there can be no middle ground. Elimination of the enemy is the only way back to harmony and peace.The third level : Metaphysical. The supreme entities are blue aliens and, in this view, the humans are on a long quest through ever-deeper knowledge to rise up to be able to see how these creatures find their bliss and harmony (meditation/sex/dancing being the simplistic illustration of this). Of course humans want their share of this and to be their equal. This can be seen as the goal of our existence in this universe : to go to the fantastic planet and leave behind the pain and misery of the human condition. Or just maybe knocking on the door of the creator to get some answers.As one can see there is a lot to appreciate and matter for thought in this eerie, beautiful and graphically original movie. Roland Topor is a weirdo, but an interesting one. The simple animation does not detract from enjoying the story and one must learn to realise that perfection of form is not the most important in conveying a good story even if it does help.I prefer a clumsy but funny Gilliam animation to a perfect but predictable Disney one. Art does not need a reason to exist, sometimes it is just the artist pleasing himself, and we chuckle away with him at his nerve at showing us his bizarre personal visions. We must sometimes stop reasoning only in terms of function and enjoy what makes us human, not just efficient commercial-minded robots (""the focus group indicates maximum joy at this scene!"" eeech.)This story is based on a french sci-fi novel called ""Oms en série"" by Stefan Wul. The music is good, typical of it's time and adds to the overall sense of watching something slightly odd from the 1970s. La Planète Sauvage is a work of art that deserves the highest praise and attention not only because it is eerily beautiful but also because it illustrates some of the most fascinating fears and hopes of humanity. Simple it may seem, but there is lot more to think about than the obvious struggle shown."
41,Fantastic Planet,10,3 July 2010,Fascinating animation,"I really liked this film. The animation was very well done, even for this time. This movie is original and visually unique, creating a fascinating world like nothing that you have seen before. René Laloux (""Gandahar"", ""Time Masters"") was one of the best animators of the history. I liked all his films, including his shorts. And this one wasn't the exception. What is more, I believe that this is his best film, being both surprising, unpredictable and entertaining.I recommend this film to anyone who loves animation, science-fiction and fantasy. It's simply superb. I give this ten stars, because is such a great film. Is always good see different styles of animation from the world."
42,Fantastic Planet,10,10 December 2006,Fantastic Planet is very innovative French-Czech animated feature,"I just discovered on YouTube this English-language version of Fantastic Planet, which was distributed in the U.S. by Roger Corman's New World Pictures. A kid Traag adopts a human-like little Om after the mother dies. This Traag learns lessons from a multiple-headphone-like device. As the Om grows, he absorbs all the Traag knowledge and eventually escapes to his homeland when he steals the Traag learning device. From there comes the climactic battle that leads to the pacifist denouement. Wonderful animation throughout with weird touches provided in this French-Czech production. Among the voices: Barry Bostwick (Rocky Horror Picture Show), Janet Waldo (Judy on The Jetsons), and Hal Smith (Otis on The Andy Griffith Show). By all means seek this rare gem out!"
43,Fantastic Planet,9,7 July 2005,"This movie hurt my brain, and I liked it","I first saw this, along with a lot of people, on NIGHT FLIGHT, on the USA cable network in the late 80s. Around this time (I was 12 or 13) I had become obsessed with really surreal, strange, and grim animated features, now that cable allowed me to see them. FANTASTIC PLANET was easily the strangest thing I'd ever seen. Now, seeing it again 20-some-odd years later, it's still one of the oddest feature-length films I've ever experienced. Now that I'm a little older, the political metaphors are a lot more transparent to me, but I'm still lost about the incredible surreality of the landscape, the repetitive images, and the dreamlike quality of the sparse dialogue. I guess Rene Laloux is just a really weird guy.Unfortunately, the DVD that I watched has English subtitles on all the time, even when the English-language audio is selected, and the giant discrepancies between the dubbed audio and the subtitles was distracting. Fortunately, though, there's not a whole lot of dialogue in it, which leaves the screen clear for more bizarre and melancholy sights.This film changed my life when I was younger, and it's even more enjoyable as an adult."
44,Fantastic Planet,10,17 March 2005,Great storytelling,"I saw this cartoon when I was a kid and it has marked me. When I recall it I have a mix of nostalgia and excitement that comes from remembering a great adventure past...The animation has aged since it was made in the 70's compared to what is done today. However the world depicted is great in originality and beats Alice in wonderland.It is a growing up story of an 'om' who becomes a great man, in a world where they are oppressed and become free (btw, om in French sounds like homme which means man or human).This cartoon has everything that makes Sci-Fi great and that is often missing in Hollywood blockbuster Sci-Fi movies: - Great imagination - Strong multi-level social message (i.e. not simplistic) - Lessons to learn - A great personal adventure of an ordinary anti-herothat turns great - An outworldly experience - An original story - Fairy tale like storytelling quality - No simplistic 'good vs evil' judgemental messagethat leads to unreasonable hatred and feuding - A message to step back and take time to understand a situationand understand the others.This cartoon is a reference in the genre."
45,Fantastic Planet,9,8 September 1998,A to-see cartoon,"Very nice cartoon with good animation and a very intelligent subject.  A bit of Swift (Gulliver) in a modern key, with allusions to contemporary events, but with many fruition levels."
46,Fantastic Planet,8,23 January 2017,Why are they blue?,"This film is bizarre. That is not a bad thing. I don't know that I've ever seen a science fiction film set on a world which feels so completely alien. There was never a point while I was watching Fantastic Planet where I felt, ""Yeah, I think I've got the gist of it now."" Laloux seems to take great pleasure in filling every frame of this film with some new strange creation. The titular Fantastic Planet revealed to the viewer is not some sort of parallel Earth whose only discernible difference from our own world is the presence of some blue fauna. The Fantastic Planet doesn't seem to be a place one could fathom ever existing in the universe. Of course that in no way impedes the story. It only really compliments it. The urgency and curiosity created by such a setting acts as a pretty strong hook to keep you watching. While you're completely invested in the plight of the characters, you will also find yourself constantly wondering what new weird creature might make itself known in the next scene. What higher compliment could there be for a science fiction animation?To speak of the animation. It's wonderful stop motion that I could see turning some people off to this film. Admittedly, I found it totally jarring for the first couple of minutes. I found though that I got used to it after not very long, and it in no way kept me from totally being completely hypnotized. After having completed the film, I can't really imagine it any other way. It isn't smooth and graceful. Some times it can feel more like a subtly shifting painting rather than a traditional cartoon. Really though, it only makes sense for the story. It's not natural. It's off. So is the Fantastic Planet."
47,Fantastic Planet,8,30 May 2013,Masters Of Cinema Cast,Masters Of Cinema Cast - Episode 5 - Rene Laloux's Fantastic PlanetIts not often you can say 'I have never seen anything like that before' come the end of a given film. 's Fantastic Planet might just be one of those films however; in age where directors can literally do and put anything on screen achieving the desired 'wow' factor has become an increasingly rare thing. Laloux didn't have 3D or CGI at his disposal in 1971; just some extremely talent cartoon artists a seriously funky score and some extremely crazy ideas and still manages to leave jaws on the floor.It maybe easy to dismiss Fantastic Planet as some post Hippy movement nonsense complete with psychedelic imagery barely concealable political allegories and although it maybe very much a product of its time it remains a compelling and indeed visionary oddity.In this episode we dig into why this film maybe of interest and try not to lose ourselves down the rabbit hole by thinking too much about it....http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-five-fantastic-planet.html
48,Fantastic Planet,9,27 May 2012,Homage to Director Rene Laloux,"Though this is a critique of Fantastic Planet (La planète sauvage), it is also an homage to director Rene Laloux. As an indie filmmaker, I am his beneficiary on so many levels. Once upon a time in the mid 70s, there was the Ashland Film Society in Southern Oregon. The curators of the Society screened 16 mm prints of foreign films in community centers and lecture halls. These films were not widely distributed in small town markets at that time. Society members were treated to classics by Kurosawa, Bergman, Fellini, and Cocteau. It is impossible for me to overrate the visual impressions these films imprinted on my mind and emotional body, and the lasting influence they have had in my creative work in theatre and film. One of the classics screened by the society was Fantastic Planet, which I have revisited recently on DVD. It had been 40 year since I originally saw this masterpiece flickering in 16 mm in a dark room, the sound crackling from a single speaker under the portable screen, and yet, as I view it again, I remember vividly its startling animation, presenting its story with originality, intelligence, and sensuality. The script, too, is masterful, investigating the plight of human beings (called Oms) as pets in a world dominated by giants of superior intellect called the Traag, who live artistic and meditative lives on a planet populated by unusually beautiful and dangerous flora and fauna. In this alien world, the Traag procreate by meeting in a meditative state to make love on a nearby moon. Though these super beings have an ultra sensibility of ""civilized"" behavior, their treatment of Oms belies the very foundation of their artistic and technological Utopia, which leads to a violent rebellion led by the reluctant Om, Terr. Much like Shakespeare, its political undertones are as valid today as the day it was released. Not that its tone is Shakespearean. But it does, like Shakespeare, present critical and universal metaphors about absolute power and the abuse thereof, to which it behooves us to take note. Director Laloux has infused the animated medium with a palpable visual poetry with extraordinary simplicity, and that reminds me of how indebted I am for the seeds he sowed, lo, those 40 years ago at my virgin viewing. He has encouraged me in absentia to express my inner most self as fantastically, and poetically, and politically, and simply as I am able. As a postscript, I highly recommend viewing the Laloux interview included as a special feature on DVD."
49,Fantastic Planet,7,13 November 2010,A successful neo-Biblical tale praising multi-culturalism and openness,"Fra Angelico and Bosch meet Chirico and Dalí in a simple, metaphorical neo-Biblical animated tale praising multi-culturalism and openness.Terr is Adam, dismissed from Eden because of the Forbidden Fruit - Knowledge. Except here, Knowledge is the very tool that will help Terr / Adam to free himself - and his race along with him... A socialist interpretation can also be made here (let us not forget the movies dates back to 1973): Knowledge (therefore progress - from which industrialization and urbanization derive) is the tool that will help the masses - Humans - free themselves from the elite - here, the Draags.Recommended!"
50,Fantastic Planet,5,23 January 2004,It sure isn't fantastic,"After hearing wonderful things about this film and seeing that is won an award at the Cannes film festival I had to check it out. The film has an interesting concept and some strong political statements...too bad that it doesn't amount to anything. Quite hypnotic at first and full of creative drawings, but horribly animated with many sequences consisting of little more than mouths moving. Stiff dialogue, poor characterizations, and an all around feeling of aloofness bury the film from the get-go. I understand that the film has something to say and that it's not supposed to be aimed at children in any way..but it's not entertaining in the least! That makes for a very long 72 minutes. ** out of ****"
51,Fantastic Planet,3,19 March 2015,"Perfect if you are tripping, otherwise don't do it","Good points: Animation is interesting style, nice textures, fun obscure looking creatures. Good old 70's chilled Pink Floyd style guitar music. If you were high it would be memorising Bad points: Animation is not smooth and you can tell they minimised the work as much as possible. It has dated hugely! I don't know if the ideas and storyline were original in the 70's but it doesn't seem new or interesting now. It seems to be like a documentary in its narrative, very stilted with no emotional content. The ending was lacklustre, without adding spoilers I'd say it went from chaos to suddenly winning the revolution within a couple of minutes. In conclusion: If you have nostalgia, are high, like odd creatures, go ahead. If not, watch something else. If you fancy something similar, I prefer heavy metal or wizards myself, bit more entertaining to say the least"
52,Fantastic Planet,8,9 July 2005,"An Animated ""Head"" Trip","There has been a plethora of adult animated movies in the 1970's, RalphBakshi et al, and many of them have become perennial cult classics.Rene Laloux is the French director of 1973's French/Czechoslovakian masterpiece ""Fantastic Planet"" and Roland Topor is the animator. The drawings, which are highly artistic and complex, pays tribute to Terry Gilliam, the animator of ""Monty Python,"" though not as humorous, the ""head"" styles of ""Yellow Submarine,"" and even to Bakshi himself, with the anthropomorphisms and occasional nudity.The story, supposedly based on the events of the 1968 Soviet takeover of Czechoslovakia, where the movie was partly animated. It is a story of one human ""Om"" (French for ""man"") named Terr, who loses his mother in the beginning of the movie, is taken care by aliens who become his captors, and then escapes from his alien captor family known as ""Traags"" to a race of humans. With his device of intellectual ""Traag"" knowledge in his head, he passes that knowledge to the other Oms and frees them from the captivity of the merciless ""Traags.""This movie is not for everyone. It deals with the topic of slavery, although more subtle in this movie than most. This is one of the more slower-paced animated movies, as most foreign cartoons can be as opposed to the Disney movies were used to, despite it's 71 minutes. The Bakshi movies are fast-paced and in-your-face, as adult cartoon movies go. Also, we see many female characters walk around with bare breasts. But if you like animation that is ""different,"" and I actually do, you may appreciate this flick which was a grand prize winner at the Cannes Film Festival and regularly played on USA's ""Night Flight"" program 20 years ago. The ""Night Flight"" program was a late-night cable show that specialized in rock videos and cult films. Check out ""Fantastic Planet"" and see how fantastic this movie was."
53,Fantastic Planet,8,9 July 2003,Rich animated fable,"This animated sci-fi fantasy is very richly drawn - both physically and plot-wise.Some of the symbolism is a bit heavy-handed to my tastes - especially the whipping trees during the exile and the overt phallic rockets - but the dramatization and interesting philosophical themes of the story are excellent. The most striking one is the comparison of the alien overlords with the human slaves, who are treated as either pets or pests.Also excellent is the coloring; with the wonderful toning that this film displays - which looks airbrushed."
54,Fantastic Planet,,25 December 1998,Fantastic imagination,"The plot is simplistic and predictable, but the level of artistic and scientific imagination in the construction of a truly alien world puts this film up there with the best of science fiction. A tour de force of exobiology, one could only imagine what modern filmmakers could do by porting _Fantastic Planet's_ ideas into a live-action film with digital imagery.The laserdisc has both French and English dialogue tracks (and it's subtitled) but the score and monaural soundtrack leave much to be desired, and I find this film is best enjoyed by watching with the sound turned off."
55,Fantastic Planet,3,7 January 2006,"Neither a masterpiece, nor scifi, nor allegory","Don't watch this movie expecting some clever allegory, nor speculative sf. It's no masterpiece either - extremely dated music, downright cheesy by today's standards, and the ""adult themes"" are limited to lots of identical-looking bare female breasts (and a glimpse or two of an occasional tiny penis).It seems like the filmmakers started out with grand ambitions, but ran out of money, since the editing & general story has major continuity problems, and the ending stops the story short like a brick wall. The story is extremely simple, and has been told a million times, before and since. The ""allegory"" is limited pretty much to the idea of ""Soviet Union = blue giants, Eastern European nations = tiny humans; can't we all just get along?"". It's also a low- budget animated film, so don't expect even Hannah-Barbara level production values.However, if you're interested in some trippy, hippy spins on weirdo-70s alien lifeforms - sweater barfing tribbles, giant anteater bats, seasons that are marked by crystals growing on your body, etc., then check it out. There are definitely some clever ideas from an art direction standpoint going on here - too bad the filmmakers didn't have the budget or the writers to do it justice.Not entertaining, but of interest to fans of obscure animation."
56,Fantastic Planet,5,2 August 2008,A 'Planet Of The Apes' Animated Takeoff,"This is an animated film made 45 years ago (1973) by the French, has the English title of ""Fantastic Planet."" Early on, it reminded me of the ""Planet of the Apes"" story in which ""human"" were the captives and someone else (aliens, here, called ""Draags"") were the ""masters."" He, we are the ""humanoids,"" the visitors, so to speak on a foreign planet.In this story, the aliens are huge and appear not to be hostile. The humans are very small, people who can fit in the palms of the Draags' hands. The humanoids, however, are really slaves on this ""fantastic planet"" until one of them learns the local language and unites his fellow captives. That's putting it in a nutshell, since I don't want to say too much to spoil the ending, which is the best part of the film..A lot of people rave about the artwork but I didn't think it was anything that great. It's very primitive, and maybe that's part of the attraction. Then again, it was made 35 years ago, so you aren't going to get the artistic slickness you see today. (However, ""Yellow Submarine"" was made before this animated movie and that was pretty mind-blowing animation!) It would definitely remind you minimalist artists."
57,Fantastic Planet,1,18 January 2015,Nothing Appealing Whatsoever,"I originally watched this film because it was a strange looking animated film that attracted my attention in a weird sort of way. To my disappointment, I found this movie boring, dull, and uninteresting. The storyline was so slow and completely unengaging. It was a unique concept for a plot but was not executed well at all. The quality of the film was extremely poor, especially the terrible animation. If you liked The Beatles' Yellow Submarine, this is probably a film for you. The film was a waste of my time and was worthless as far as I am concerned. I am struggling to draw this out because it was not even worth the ten lines of text that is needed to post this review."
58,Fantastic Planet,6,18 August 2013,Trippy but Ultimately Mediocre and Creepy,"This movie is quite an experience. Maybe I just haven't seen enough movies, but the whole feel and art style of the film was quite unique to me. In every scene of the movie, something weird and alien is introduced: bizarre creatures, advanced alien technology, other-worldy landscapes and vegetation. Watching this movie is like taking a trip to another dimension.The film works as an experience, but no so much as a full-fledged movie. Perhaps it should have been a music video instead of a movie. The plot is the most trite, sterile, unoriginal thing in the world. The writing for the character's dialogue and interactions are cold and emotionally stunted. The film makes me think the writer of the film is some cynical, immature, nihilistic, reductionist college sophomore trying to make some ham-handed point about societal relations. The whole premise of the movie, humans being playthings for giant oppressive blue aliens, implies the movie will teach some elevating and inspirational lesson about appreciating other living beings as being more deep, intelligent, and multifaceted than we can perceive on the surface, but ultimately the movie actually seems intent on actually REDUCING humanity and societal relations to mere stereotypical cavemen bludgeoning each other to death over petty ignorance, and simplistic fears and superstitions. Despite that criticism, the film is valuable for its depiction of human beings being treated as mere playthings or animals. The visceral experience of watching it stirs something deep down in a way that can't be put into words.So, to sum it up, this a pretty mediocre film, but worth watching for the unique experience. The movie puts your mind into that creepy ""uncanny valley"" and keeps you there the whole time. I think the movie would have been better off if they just cut the dialogue, set it to some psychedelic music, and let the viewer use their imagination to assume what is going on, because the plot really does not have enough going on."
59,Fantastic Planet,6,7 October 2005,tale of systematic oppression and extermination told thru 70's animation,"Sci-fi based cartoon of lower class slaves (humans) being abused, murdered, deprived of knowledge, and basically treated like ""pets"" (if they are ""lucky) while upper class aliens (""ohms"") lives life at their leisure in bliss. Similar to ""Animal Farm"" in the use of a cartoons to soften the depiction of evils of society while not directly showing blood and guts gore. Depicts scenes of hunting and extermination of unnecessary ""slaves"" with poison gases like roaches. Maybe not for children or sensitive groups, but very entertaining if you are able to follow the sometimes slow storyline. This could almost used as an entertaining educational tool for college classes in the study of social oppression based on class levels or the evils of slavery. The animation is 70's based soft shades and colors not anime'."
60,Fantastic Planet,10,18 March 2003,Great Bizarre Animated Art of Roland Topor,"This is one of the best cult animated films ever.  The story (based on the novel The Savage Planet by Stefan Wul) is wonderful, the animation and directing is excellent, the music is hauntingly strange!  I remember watching this on TV as a kid and I was mezmerized by the story of these people being controlled by these giant aliens and having a strange feeling like this has happened in the past before..and I couldn't stop watching. Once you get the story and are drawn in by the central character (Terr), it will suck you in and you can't wait to see what happens to them.  The story contains mythological qualities which tie into social struggles in various civilizations and even the human condition in our universe on planet earth. If you would like to see a bizarre metaphysical head trip of a movie, then watch this!"
61,Fantastic Planet,,7 January 2003,Drug-Induced Surrealism,"I find that I must pull out this movie and watch it once every few years. Movies don't get a lot stranger than this one.  Watching ""Fantastic Planet"" is like watching a dream Salvador Dali might have had in the 1970s after dropping acid, listening to Pink Floyd, and watching ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Horton Hears a Who"" simultaneously.  If this sounds appealing to you (and why wouldn't it?), you'll most likely enjoy this movie.  Be warned: the film moves at a glacial pace.  It's more about imagery than story or plot. Very imaginative stuff."
62,Fantastic Planet,10,16 August 2002,Minimalist Sci/Fi,"The animation, sound and script are very minimalist and turn a pretty good sci/fi story into high art.  While this is an animation it isn't a cartoon. There is a sense of realism throughout the film.  The video I have is of poor quality though."
63,Fantastic Planet,9,25 June 2000,Bizarre and haunting animated feature,"One of the most absolutely strange and beautiful films I have ever seen. Set on a unbelievably freaky alien world filled with creatures and settings that absolutely defy description. I can not add anything that the other comments have not said, but any fan of animated films or science fiction should see this one immediately!!!!!"
64,Fantastic Planet,10,12 February 2002,An Incredible Storyline,"Wow ... I was totally captivated when I first saw this movie. Based on a book and completely in French with English Sub-titles, it tells a great story about the fears and differences in races. The music is absolutely brilliant, setting the scene perfectly (ala 70s wah-wah) and it was this that initially grabbed my attention. Also, the artwork is exception, especially for it's time.
This is must watch movie - I'd love to get it on DVD -- but I can't find it anywhere. :("
65,Fantastic Planet,10,9 October 2001,"an animation, not a cartoon",My VCR version was in English even though the language says French.  The recording quality was terrible but tended not to detract from the quality of the production.  I rated this film a 10 because of the serious work that was put into the script and the animation.  Although the futurism used in the story is old I don't think it is dated.  The story has a Yellow Submarine quality without the humor.  The animation is not realism but works very well with the script.  I recommend this film to budding animation producers to see what can be done with the art.
66,Fantastic Planet,7,19 November 2017,Another bizarre mind trip,"This was one of a set of gift movies my brother had provided to me last year, and I managed to find time today to view it with him. I had no idea what to expect from this film given its home media cover, though one rather annoying thing was that the menu was somewhat wonky. I had to enable subtitles during the film rather than through the menu because of this, though since it wasn't original 1973 theater format, it wasn't anything I should detract from this movie. As for the movie itself?As the name implies, the story's setting is on the fantastic planet (sorry) Ygam, with the Renaissance-style-human depicted Oms and the enormous Draags sharing it. Given how it's a fantasy sci-fi (which in other movies would seem paradoxical), it throws out all these ideas of flora, fauna, and other things to set it apart from reality as much as possible. I don't know about you who might be reading this, but I ended up very confused by this since I thought that some ideas would get a tad more explanation, so they wouldn't be there just for the sake of being there. Anyway, there is one humorous gag earlier on and some drama in the fighting scenes and aftermath. Put simply, the plot is a lot like Night on the Galactic Railroad; there's almost too much going on that you can't wrap your head around it. The animation is also perplexing; it incorporates, as I mentioned, a more fantastic, Renaissance style for the Ohms and scenery and a sci-fi style for the Draags and most of the plot elements. I can understand it being 1973 and thus not being comparable to more recent drawn movies like The Prophet, but the animation is sometimes choppy and not fluid enough when it's important. At the very least, it doesn't recycle animation like what Disney did the same year. It's satisfactory overall, but could have benefited from more movement in other areas unless it was a lower budget movie. If that were the case, I could feel more sympathy for it. Most of the characters are forgettable not because they're too plain and bland, but because they interact with so much that one will be left thinking about anything but the characters. It's generally a movie driven much more by its own plot than by the characters who carry this plot out. Given how I saw it in its original French (though subtitled in English, like I personally prefer), I can't really say much about the acting except that it passes. If you enjoy fantasy or sci-fi, this film is for you. For the common viewer, it's worth a glimpse just in case you're empty-headed or need way too many things to think about. Children, though, may be more bored by this film since it isn't driven by its characters; if my brother actually fell asleep during it (I honestly had to fight the urge twice), I can't imagine how much differently it would play out for younger audiences. Speaking of which, mind the occasional violence and nudity if you are viewing this with young ones. If there's one thing you should be before watching this film, it's completely awake."
67,Fantastic Planet,7,28 May 2017,A unique and surreal journey unlike anything you've ever seen.,"Fantastic Planet is an animated science fiction not for casual audiences nor for anyone looking to kill some time. This is slow-paced and thought-provoking journey that'll genuinely change anyone who sees it. Despite what the trailer will divulge, this is a solid and cohesive narrative that never feels confusing. So long as the viewer is paying attention to what's going on, grasping the story should be fairly simple. Fantastic planet examines a fantastical story of humanoid beings sharing a planet with larger and far more intelligent large blue giants. The plot focuses on the human's uprising against the superior species and presents a fascinating construct between the two civilizations. Personally, it asked surface level questions like ""Do small insects view us this way?"" While bigger questions arise like ""What kind of statement is this film attempting to make regarding racism, intolerance, and cohabitation with different species?""Although this is an animated classic from the 70s. Showing this to the kids probably isn't the best idea. Not only does it include disturbing imagery and sexuality, its themes and story is best suited for a mature audience ready for more of an animated experience. For any animation or science fiction buffs, this film is definitely one to check out. For the casual movie-goer, might want to skip this one save your head from more scratching than it would like."
68,Fantastic Planet,5,23 March 2015,"Welcome To The ""Less-Than-Fantastic"" Planet","This animated, Sci-Fi, Fantasy tale from 1973 was, in my opinion, clearly ""less-than-fantastic"" on all counts. From its cut-out, paper-doll animation; to its ugly and nonsensical story of survival and revenge; to its ""far-from-likable"" characters - Fantastic Planet certainly could've been a helluva lot better than it inevitably was.Even though the decidedly diminutive humans (aka. Oms) were the ones being portrayed as the oppressed underdogs in the story, I, for one, found it pretty difficult to root for their victory when they stood their ground in an all-out revolt against the red-eyed, blue-skinned giants known as Draags.Yes. Fantastic Planet did, indeed, contain some very bizarre and trippy looking imagery at times, but, in the long run, this certainly wasn't near enough to save its story from deteriorating into a monotonous bore long before its 70-minute running time was up.Apparently this French production won itself a jury prize (whatever that was) at Cannes.Anyways - Even though I would honestly be quite reluctant to recommend Fantastic Planet to others, I would say that it was at least worth one viewing."
69,Fantastic Planet,5,7 March 2008,The Fantastic Planet,"I had the pleasure of watching Fantastic Planet. The animation was good, and the story was excellent. The only thing that seemed to bother me was that there seemed to be more story than time. I'm not saying don't watch it you should it's still a good movie, it's just the only character that seemed to get any development was Terr. They only touched on Tiwa to the extent that she was Terr's master. The story was excellent, I'm not being wishy washy, it's just I wish they would have had more time. There were certain aspects of the film that seemed forced or rushed. I can't exactly what without giving aspects away, but that's about the only thing wrong with this film.If you happen to stumble on to this movie, you should buy it. If you are thinking of buying or renting it, I will tell you this much, sit past the first ten minutes. At first you'll think it has to be viewed on drugs...trust me that would only take away from your enjoyment. Please enjoy your journey on the Fantastic Planet."
70,Fantastic Planet,,17 September 2001,I totally agree with rest: this is masterpiece,"Really not many more things I can say, many people around seem to have loved it. I will just say that its got a perfect-fit soundtrack of great early-psychedelic-guitary music, great atmosfear, and even not for everybody(maybe due to its slow pace), it should satisfy anyone who's looking for non-american , original cartoons. The art + animation technique is beautiful and original, and the whole thing has got a bit of a psychedelic touch. Great idea on the plot too!!!"
71,Fantastic Planet,,22 April 2013,Produced by mental patients.,"At least that's what the documentary on the DVD I saw stated. Well, I finally saw this film over the last few months, and I can't say I'm all that impressed with it. The animation, for the time, I understand had to be restrained because of lack of resources, but even so the story seems like some kind of hackneyed parable on sexual repression.I'm just curious what went through the director's mind to produce this film in the first place, and why it's given such high praise. Is it because it was a French production that got shoved over to Chekoslovakia before being put back in France due to concerns about the communist takeover? Was it the alleged ""avante garde"" aspect of the artistry in the film, which to me merely a nicety for low budget cartoon. Just what do people absorb, like and find fascinating and fulfilling about this movie?I don't know. But I'll say this, it is a lack luster production that I think only the patients who made the thing in the first place could love. The voice acting is, well, so-so, the animation is static and selectively smooth, the rendering of the planet itself is pretty plain, and the overall story, including the ""climax"" at the end is just too weird to believe. Disney, it ain't.And yet I sat through the thing hoping to find what it is that people love so much about this movie. And I simply didn't see anything redeeming about this film.The basic story involves giant beings taking Earth folks as pets, and how said pets fight for freedom. Then the Earth people learn the ""secret"" of their giant masters, and deal with them in a not so spectacular, in fact down right idiotic final confrontation that looks like it was animated by a bunch of preschoolers. It's that bad.Well thank goodness I checked this thing out at the library and wasn't forced to waste good hard earned money renting a copy.Watch at your own risk. In fact, don't watch it."
72,Fantastic Planet,5,11 March 2012,Straight out of a sexually repressed nightmare.,"Strangest movie I have every seen. And I have seen many an odd movie. French psychedelic experience to the max. There was a lot of effort in creating this movie. The detailed alien landscapes and creatures, the glare in the boys blue eyes, the transitions, all were thought through in depth. It is not hard to believe this came straight out of a sexually repressed nightmare, it is hard to believe that someone put so much time into making this movie.This would be a good candidate for an early 1990s remake. Not animated, real live actors in a plastic animatronic landscape.My mind feels weird after all this Fantastic Planet."
73,Fantastic Planet,7,11 November 2016,A Much Different Cartoon,"This futuristic story takes place on a faraway planet where blue giants rule, and oppressed humanoids rebel against the machine-like leaders.The film was an international co-production between companies from France and Czechoslovakia and was distributed in the United States by indie film giant Roger Corman. The story, about humans living on a strange planet dominated by giant humanoid aliens who consider them animals, is based on the 1957 novel ""Oms en série"" by French writer Stefan Wul.I love that Corman got involved, because he really was a champion of film. Not just indie film, but bringing foreign film to America. He is not given enough credit. Today (2016) this film seems a bit dated, because its anti-racism message is sort of obvious, but it still makes an interesting point regarding different species and the cut-out style of animation has to be admired."
74,Fantastic Planet,8,5 May 2009,Dali + Dr Seuss...with sci-fi!,"Simply put, Laloux's Fantastic Planet is a wildly inventive animation, creating an alien, surrealist world amidst a bleak, washed-out backdrop. The animation is stellar for its time and limited animation team, and the funky 70's French dub works just fine.This film was one of those rare treats that you stumble across and instantly want to see everything else the director has been capable of. Start at Fantastic Planet. The region 4 DVD contains two fantastic shorts, Comment Wang and The Snails, which can be found on youtube anyway along with all Laloux's other shorts.8/10"
75,Fantastic Planet,7,18 August 2002,The title says it all.,"This is a beautifully animated film with a great ending that will leave you wanting to watch it again. I had never heard of this film until my friend had brought it over one day. After watching it I wondered about owning a copy for myself. It is pretty hard to find in stores and the only place I found it was on ebay even a collector's edition on DVD which has a few short films from the director in addition to the film. Either way on VHS or DVD, I still love this movie, even the soundtrack is unlike anything I've heard in a long time."
76,Fantastic Planet,8,24 December 1998,"Strange, but strangely intriguing. Recommended.","This is an utterly strange movie, but also quite intriguing. A glimpse into a completely alien world through the eyes of an outsider - a human. Fascinating."
77,Fantastic Planet,8,28 June 2010,Fantastic Planet,"I was searching for images of this film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and as soon as I knew it was a cartoon I was very keen to see it. I should start by saying that the version I saw was in the French language with subtitles, but there is a version dubbed into English featuring The Rocky Horror Picture Show's Barry Bostwick. Anyway, basically the story takes place on the planet Ygam, ruled by the giant blue humanoid aliens known as the Draags, and there are also the tiny human slaves called the Oms. A baby Om is orphaned by the Draags killing its mother, and Draag daughter Tiwa (Jennifer Drake) takes the child as her pet, with the permission of her father Master Sinh (Jean Topart). Even though he has a collar on him, the Om child that grows, Terr (Eric Baugin, then Jean Valmont) likes spending time with his ""owner"", but he realises other Oms are being killed at random. Terr escapes from the Draag world and travels through desert land until he eventually finds the Om world and joins the tribe. When escaping, Terr managed to steal a headphone set that contains and feeds all the knowledge of the planet and the Draags directly into the brain. Armed with this technological knowledge the Oms build all the weapons and equipment they need as they plan to defend themselves against their giant enemy. In the end though, the Draags and Oms have killed many of each other in big numbers, but they both step down from attacking each other and find some sort of peace, as far as I remember. I was intrigued by how similar the animation was to style of Monty Python, the bounciness of how characters, objects and creatures move across the screen, and the (unintentionally) funny shapes and looks of these things. I was very surprised by how much this film takes you into this surreal and stunningly visual world, complete with some assisting music and impressive sound effects creation, it is a fantastic French/Czech animated science-fiction fantasy. Very good!"
78,Fantastic Planet,,2 September 2003,blah blah blah animation,"oh geez...Where shall I start with this one... Ok , I had actually read GREAT & WONDERFUL things about this film.When I seen it - I was in shock. I think director Rene Laloux could use A LOT of pointers from Ralph Bakshi , when it comes to GOOD animation. This film is a very intellectual , but the story is so depressing and hard to follow - that after the first 45 minutes , I did'nt want to watch it any longer. I agree with an LA Times critic when he said that this film is ""eerie and imaginative"". But I also say that the animation is UGLY and the story itself is way lame. I understand this film won the um... , won the 1973 Cannes Film Festival Grand Prix Award and this arrises an important question for me...What the heck were those judges ON when it came to dealing with THIS film!? It's totally ugly to look at and the story makes me depressed. If I'm going to watch a French film with English subtitles - I feel it should actually be worth watching! In my opinion - this movie is not worth an award. My rating...not hard to do this - 1/10"
79,Fantastic Planet,5,5 March 2017,Dated soundtrack ruins it,"I had wanted to see this film for years, and when the film begins it's pretty jarring watching human beings get treated as pets by gigantic blue aliens. As a social commentary the theme is still relevant, given that the world is controlled by an increasingly smaller number of super-rich people, but the twangy street-style music that you might find in any 1970s blaxploitation film is a failed experiment in contrasts. No music at all would have improved the film, I challenge anyone to prove me wrong. One thing that bothered me is the inordinate amount of time that the aliens spent publicly talking about the humans, when really they amounted to little more than pests like cockroaches or houseflies; time and time again it's demonstrated that the aliens have evolved far beyond humans, so why devote so many resources to talking about them?In the end, the aliens and the humans find a way to work together, which seems like a rather optimistic denouement for a European film. For you reviewers who dropped the m-word on this film, does the word still have any meaning when you encounter a true masterpiece like citizen kane or the mona lisa, or do you have some other superlative tucked away in your brain?"
80,Fantastic Planet,10,6 July 2016,It's all in the soundtrack,"I first watched this movie without subtitles (I don't speak French) and simply listened to the soundtrack and watched the animation. A few months later I watched the movie with subtitles and followed the plot. I imagine some will find the plot interesting, and it's a cool story for those who like imaginative sci fi. However, I found that the soundtrack absolutely stole the show and commanded most of my attention. The arrangements are dense, dark and swirling. The animations compliment the music wonderfully and made for a hypnotic, contemplative experience. Check this movie out for the music, and maybe see if the story interests you."
81,Fantastic Planet,8,24 February 2002,"Weird, but interesting","This is one very, very strange film. I liked it, but it is very strange. I would agree that it has elements of both Jonathan Swift and metaphors involving class struggles. However, it is taken to such an extreme that you could watch the film without those contexts. This would definitely fall in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre. The animation itself is very enjoyable and certainly different from what we typically see these days."
82,Fantastic Planet,8,17 February 2001,Fabulous animated trip,"I saw this film when it was first released and the memory has remained. I was utterly enthralled by the originality of the animated style, the story and the score. I was thrilled when I recently re-discovered this little gem."
83,Fantastic Planet,,31 August 2002,A COOL MOVIE,"Just finished viewing ""Fantastic Planet"" on FLIX.First saw it around 1983, on USA Networks ""Night Flight Theater"".At least my 50th viewing.I have always dug this film.The music is haunting.I'm surprised there are so many people who don't ""get"" this film.It's painfully obvious, isn't it?Remember the context this film was made under.The Czechs were under the heel of the Soviet Union.A classic!!!USMC-FDNY"
84,Fantastic Planet,10,20 December 2000,Excellent,"Captivating and offbeat SF animated adventure. The use of the waltz in Gorageur's musical score during the climactic scene is worth watching the film for in itself. The script is absorbing and while the animation is not as expensive as, say, Disney it is vastly more original in conception. This isn't for everyone but it certainly deserved the award it won at Cannes."
85,Fantastic Planet,5,30 April 2014,A lot to like and a lot to hate.,"""Fantastic Planet"" is one of the stranger sci-fi films I have ever seen. Some of this strangeness is good, as the film has a great other-worldly look to it. This planet truly is odd. Additionally, the story has some interesting elements as well. But, on the flip side, the animation quality is just horrible and sometimes the film seems weird just for the sake of being weird. It is definitely NOT a film that the typical person would enjoy!!As far as the animation goes, I think part of the problem was when it was made. Quality standards in the 60s and 70s for animation slipped drastically compared to the great 1940s and 50s. Cell-counts now had dropped and sloppy drawings were becoming more and more acceptable--and this is very evident in ""Fantastic Planet"". The number of cells per second is so low that instead of appearing animated, at times it looks more like a slide show! And, often almost everything is non-animated and only an arm of mouth moves--again, this is very poor. What is amazing is that this film took five years to animate. You'd think this would result in a great looking film--and in this case you would clearly be wrong! To me, the animation is simply ugly. So, if I hated the animation so much, why do I still give the film a 5? Well, the story is pretty cool, though the ending is really, really rushed. In this strange world, it's ruled by the Draags--gigantic strange looking blue beings. They are intelligent and technologically advanced but spend a lot of their time meditating and doing very little that is obviously useful. Their pets are the Ohms--which appear to be itsy-bitsy humans. The Draags view them like we'd view rats--making some pets and occasionally exterminating large colonies. This makes you think about our own pets and how we treat them! I'd say more, but it's really just something you need for yourself--rushed ending and all. This is, provided you can stand the god-awful animation."
86,Fantastic Planet,5,25 March 2012,"Oh, the disappointment","I have wanted to see this film for nearly 40 years. I have loved science fiction since I first encountered it in the 60s, and I have loved animation even longer than that. And I've seen stills in books for years, plus I've heard good things, plus it won an award at Cannes...And now I've seen it.And I didn't think much of it. I might have thought higher of it had I seen it in 1973 when there wasn't so much science fiction out there, but I'd like to think I wouldn't have been impressed even then.The story is trite, formulaic stuff, and it was trite, formulaic stuff when it was made. The moral is decent enough, but hardly very original.The visual design aspect falls halfway between Terry Gilliam's work in Monty Python and Heinz Edelmann's production design for Yellow Submarine. This aspect is, perhaps, the most successful part of the film but, again, hardly that original.The animation itself is most disappointing, being very limited - many scenes are presented as a static image with just one small element animated (just the mouth on a face, for instance).And after all these years, too. I wish I hadn't bothered."
87,Fantastic Planet,5,28 August 2013,Not Fantastic,"I'm utterly surprised at this movie's high rating because I could hardly make head nor tail of it and felt like I was watching an animated sci-fi version of The Emperor's New Clothes . The emperor may be very well dressed in an animated style but he's still naked The story involves one of those well worn clichéd stories of an intelligent rather amoral race called Draags that is alien oppressing self aware cypher people called Oms who are obvious metaphors for humanity and a human leader called Ter leading a rebellion against the oppressors . Anyone expecting a Pierre Boulle type allegorical tale along the lines of "" get your damn paws off me you blue skinned bald fascist "" is going to be very disappointed . At some points the story almost seems to cross this track then it goes in to another meandering direction entirely And this is what tends to drag everything down , or to be more exact the problems are two fold . There's a completely esoteric aspect to the storytelling almost as if chunks from a novel is being adapted to screen but anyone without any knowledge of the source material will be bewildered as to the intricate meaning . I could quote large chunks of the dialogue but the IMDb system would reject this review as having constant and numerous spelling errors . In other words the audience will be left confused at the transcendental , mystical nonsense and technobabble on screen which takes obfuscation to new heights . The other fault is the rather lacuna and episodic nature of the story telling where things happen just because the animator thought it was a good idea at the time Some people might be impressed by the animation and I'm certainly not going to claim it's bad in anyway and was constantly reminded of the Terry Gilliam sequences from the TV series MONTY PHYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS . certainly there's no way a film like this could have ever been brought to screen via live action but just because a film is surreal doesn't necessarily make it a great one and almost always a great film has to have a great story and this is not a great film"
88,Fantastic Planet,8,27 June 2017,Surrealist animated landmark,"Fantastic Planet is famed French animator René Laloux's most famous film. This co-production between France and Czechoslovakia is a highly dream-like and imaginative work whose trippy visual ideas would make a mark in the psychedelic early 70's era. Set on the planet Ygam where the Oms (humans) are wild pests and domestic pets of the Draags, intellectual beings who tower above them. One Om escapes with a Draag learning device and uses it to assist other Oms to rise up and revolt against their overlords.There seems to be an analogy embedded within the narrative but I personally don't think the story is especially important or interesting. What this film is all about is the look and feel. The animation is truthfully very basic but the art work is beautiful. The fantastical world created here is a work of true creative imagination. Amongst many other things, we have the giant blue Draags with their red eyes who meditate and are carried sky-ward in bubbles, there are tall elaborate plants, weird creatures who produces pink foam which in turn generates clothing for the Oms, there is a giant winged creature and a planet of headless statues. All this visual invention is accompanied by a great sound design of alien sounds accompanied by a score of light prog rock. Fantastic Planet is a work of pure sci-fi creativity and one of the most distinctive animation films ever."
89,Fantastic Planet,10,24 April 2017,A Little Seen  Masterpiece,"I remember watching this movie when I was about nine or ten. I recall being struck by how beautiful the artwork and the animation was then although being so young, I did not really understand the story.I was lucky to be able to find an old VHS copy. It was a double feature with An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.(Also a beautiful film.) I have re-watched it many times since and I am always struck with how simple, yet complex both the artwork and the story are.On the planet Ygam huge blue Draags keep humans called Oms as pets. An Om mother is teased and chased until dying of exhaustion, her orphaned infant is found by Master Sinh, a key Draag leader and his daughter Tiva and she takes him as her pet.As Tiva grows older, so does her pet that she named Terr. Tiva uses headphones to gain knowledge and that knowledge is transmitted to Terr through a fault in a collar that he wears. He escapes and takes the headphones with him in order to teach other Oms. I will not give away anymore of the storyline as I do not want to spoil it for anyone. In my opinion, it is a movie that needs to be experienced without any spoilers.This film is one of the finest examples of science fiction or speculative fiction if you prefer. Made in 1973, it is a Franco-Czech production and it was directed by René Laloux and also written by Laloux and Roland Topor. It really is a classic of both animated and science fiction movies. A must-see for anyone who loves either genre."
90,Fantastic Planet,10,6 April 2017,"Bizarre Beautiful Wonder & Singular Style...Mezmerizing, Captivating & Touching","A French-Czech Production. The Language Spoken is French with English Subtitles.Do Not let that Dissuade. This Wonderfully Imaginative Animated Movie from 1973 is a Visual Presentation (and what a WOW it is) First and Foremost and the Dialog is Minimal.It is done with Limited Animation. Think Terry Gilliam (Monty Python), Ralph Bakshi, South Park, etc.But ""Limitation"" does not come to Mind after Viewing this Surreal, Dali-Esque, ""Twilight Zone"" Vibed Trip to Another Planet-Dimension-Universe. It's as Out There as it gets.The Stunning, often Disturbing, Images Dominate the Simple Story and it keeps the Viewers Attention with a Mesmerizing Display of an Off-Kilter Reality that is Off Our Planet for sure, but keeps the Connection with its Humanoid Characters at the Center.But there is an Array of Absolutely Bizarre Creatures that come from the Realm of Nightmares that Invade the Proceedings with Regularity and are so Unique They Demand Attention and Fixate the Viewer with not only a Hallucinatory Appearance but Bizarre Behavior Beyond Belief.The Film Holds Up Completely in 2017 and Once Seen its Indelible Images Remain in the Brain and a Freeze Frame is Instantly Recognizable as Captured from this Stand Alone Movie.The Musical Score is Worth Mentioning because it Underscores with a Jazz-Rock-Electronic Mood that Meshes so Magnificently Massaging the Movie with Tones that at First Presents Itself and then Fades in the Background but is Forever Reaching on an almost Subconscious Level."
91,Fantastic Planet,5,21 December 2015,Crisis of human being.,"This film is made by René Laloux who is French. This film's original name is ""La Planète Sauvage"". This film's genre is in science fiction. The original story is novel by Stephen Ur who is French. Place of this film is in any planet. There are Doragu group of the giants and Om group of the little people in the planet. Doragu group's appearance seems alien and has the ears looking like fish gills. Om group of the little people look like human. This planet has been dominated by the Doragu group. Om group is often at the mercy of the Doragu group. This film begins from the scene that a mother of Om group holding a baby escapes from a person of Doragu group. Then, the mother cannot live, however, her baby can alive. The baby is picked up by the children of Doragu group. And, he is brought up by her for her pet. This film is very ideological. If you watch the film, you maybe feel the fear. Because, in this movie is drawn stupidity of human beings too."
92,Fantastic Planet,,7 August 2000,It's a head movie!,"""East German Women's Olympic Team""...""Eastern European movie"".  It's hard to take either one of those with a straight face.  They don't quite mean what they say.  In the case of the latter, and specifically ""Fantastic Planet"", it's not a lot.Done with Monty Python-esque animation, the movie attempts to tell some sort of story.  Obviously, the plot was masked to fool their Soviet overlords, presumably so full of themselves that they are like the overblown high school principal who does not realize that he's being mocked.  The plot is masked, alright.  I had no idea what was going on.  There are large, blue aliens and small people.  Other than that, I haven't a clue.Obviously, this movie is designed for those who wish to wear their tie-dyed T-shirts, blaze up and mellow out.  For those who like to stay stone cold sober, Sterno says avoid this ""movie"" at all costs."
93,Fantastic Planet,,18 September 2000,Wah,"More wah wah pedal on the soundtrack than you could shake Peter Frampton's stick at. This movie was really weird, but in a very captivating way. I like the little tribbles that barf up your clothes. I wish I had one of those.
The plot is hard to describe, so I will do it in a haiku:  Little people pets. My blue head floats up away. We stole the walkman.There, I hope that helped you understand this film better.Well deserved of the Cannes grand prize. If only for the creative use of the wah wah pedal. More movies should have wah wah pedals in their soundtracks."
