0,The Master,9,8 August 2012,The Master in action.,"I was fortunate enough to see this film much earlier than most. To me it seems like Anderson is really hitting his stride with this one. It was odd to me that upon exiting the theater the thing that I wondered about most of all is what the hell is he going to do next! The Master is not an easy movie to sit through, and at times you don't even know what the movie wants. But then you realize that the movie doesn't want anything. All it asks is for you to observe. More so than his earlier films, ""The Master"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" really venture into the realm of the film as being a purely cinematic presentation of a life. Anderson doesn't pass judgment or any point of view, he merely stretches the canvas which allows his characters to speak for themselves. Yes, there is a beginning, middle and an end, but is there? Do we really have a sense of catharsis at the end of ""There Will Be Blood""? or do we simply understand ""man"" a little better?Anderson insisted, as I'm sure he would say the same for this film, that ""There Will Be Blood"" wasn't a metaphor for anything. It was what it was. No hidden meaning, no sophisticated and often formulaic subtext. It's simply man. As Hoffman's character says in the trailer for ""The Master"" - ""But above all, I am a man"".The movie deals with an interesting idea of the leader vs. the soldier, master vs. slave. It breaks down the anatomy of a relationship so you may interpret it in any way you'd like.It's beautifully shot on 65/70mm film which is the way I saw it and the way I recommend for you to see it if you get a chance to. Feels almost as if Anderson is giving the finger to the digital revolution by shooting his film on a resolution so high that digital can only dream of getting there in about ten years or so.The acting and the dialog is superb as you'd expect. Phoenix and Hoffman are on a different level here, especially Phoenix in a role of a life time. There are definitely times in this film that he completely disappears into that role. There is also some great supporting work from Laura Dern and others.It would be difficult to place this film in his body of work. More than anything it feels like the natural continuation of what he started with ""There Will Be Blood"". Not to say that he will continue on this path but just that this is definitely a more narrowly focused film than some of his earlier ensemble work. I found it to be less engaging than some of his other work and yet there was never a dull moment. You're always on your toes, trying to understand what's going on and where the movie is leading you. It really is simply, just like man, a fascinating piece of work."
1,The Master,,15 September 2012,"""I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a theoretical philosopher, but above all, I am a man, just like you""","Paul Thomas Anderson has grown as perhaps the greatest American auteur of his generation. At 42, this is his 6th film (following 1996's ""Hard Eight"", 1997's ""Boogie Nights"", 1999's ""Magnolia"" - my all-time favorite -, 2002's ""Punch-Drunk Love"", and 2007's ""There Will Be Blood""). Like the late master Kubrick and the aging master Terrence Malick (who, coincidentally, just debuted his 6th film, ""To the Wonder"", at the latest Venice Film Festival where PTA won the Silver Lion for Best Director), he isn't the most prolific of filmmakers; but his perfectionist creations, cerebral yet strikingly cinematic and emotional, always leave an indelible mark (polarizing audiences but usually earning critical acclaim). ""The Master"" is no exception. Shot on 70mm film, it is not so much of an ""outside"" epic as you'd imagine - although every single image is stunning and perfectly composed (courtesy of cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr., who replaced Robert Elswit, Anderson's usual collaborator). It closely resembles ""There Will Be Blood"" in tone and content, but it stands on its own (Jonny Greenwood is once again responsible for the score).Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is a troubled and troubling drifter who becomes the right-hand man of Lancaster Dodd (actor extraordinaire Philip Seymour Hoffman), ""the master"" of a cult named The Cause in post-WWII America. Their strange, ambiguous relationship is the center of the film. ""The Master"" is a thought-provoking indictment of cult fanaticism and lies sold as religion, which has caused controversy and concern among Scientologists even before its release. By not mentioning real names, Anderson is capable of broadening the scope of his story and making it richer - and subtler - than a straightforward ""Scientology flick"" would have been. Like his previous films, there's more than meets the eye at a single viewing, and his attention to detail pays off (there's also a visual homage to Jonathan Demme's ""Melvin and Howard"", another favorite of Anderson's, in a motorcycle racing scene). Hoffman is as good as ever, and Amy Adams is highly effective (slowly depriving herself of cutesy mannerisms) as his wife. David Lynch's golden girl Laura Dern has a small role as well. But this is Joaquin Phoenix's hour, all the way. River Phoenix's younger brother has become a fascinating actor himself since Gus Van Sant's dark comedy ""To Die For"" (1995), and, after his much publicized ""retirement from acting"" and music career hoax in 2009, he managed to come back with a performance for the ages, which shall culminate in Oscar gold. As for Anderson, it is unsure whether the Academy will finally recognize him as he deserves. His films may still be too outlandish for the Academy's taste (he's announced his next project will be an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's crime novel ""Inherent Vice"", a seemingly less ambitious project he hopes to make in less than five years). Regardless of Oscar numbers, we can rest assured that in a world where PTA gets to make such personal and original work and find his audience, there is still hope, and room, for intelligent filmmaking."
2,The Master,9,12 September 2012,Phoenix is the performance of the year!  Anderson excels once again,"The Master is absolutely magnetic, orchestrated brilliantly by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson and helmed by the commanding turns of Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman.Anderson has never been a director that makes a film for everyone to enjoy. In the vein of auteur directors like Terrence Malick, David Lynch, and Michael Haneke, Anderson's films aren't necessarily the most accessible despite the seeming mainstream status. Films like Boogie Nights (1997), Magnolia (1999), and There Will Be Blood (2007) are reflective, tensional, studies of human behavior, all things that the average film-goer most of the time will not embrace. In The Master, Anderson constructs, absolutely magnificently I might add, two dynamic, real, and tangible men that the audience can both imagine knowing, loving, and loathe. It's the writing masterpiece of the year.Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman) gets the best character blueprints of any player to interpret. Hands down, the sharpest and best written character of the film is purely Lancaster. Anderson concentrates on his motivation and responses, giving him an arc that the audience can both easily and willingly travel with him. Hoffman's natural talents as an actor and finding himself in a character are showcased here with intensity and composure. His often seemingly blood-filled hot-headed dialogue encompasses some of the best moments of the film. It's evident Hoffman is not only enjoying himself but enjoying Lancaster. He's both repulsive but completely enamoring in structure, word, and persona. Anderson may have created the great oxymoron of cinema this century. Hoffman is damn-near perfect.The performance of the year... On the flip side, Joaquin Phoenix not only inhabits a character never seen by him or any actor before but assembles a man from scratch, beat by beat, trait by trait. It's not just the finest acting performance of the year, not only the finest acting performance this millennium, it could be the finest work of the past twenty years or so. I can only recollect a handful of actors that have the gumption to stand toe-to-toe with Phoenix's work here. His Freddie Quell is utterly unpredictable; strutting, glaring, and holding an explosive mentality that could detonate at any moment. Phoenix controls it, even though there are many instances where you feel like he's losing it. Quell is frightening, admitting his evil, unbalance, and instability. Phoenix externalizes this in his zealous and disturbing actions but more importantly internalizes it in body language and character beats that not many actors dedicated to the craft can achieve. Joaquin Phoenix is not just Oscar-worthy, he's Oscar-bound. It's the performance you can't deny, the performance of the year. Let's hope they don't.Where Phoenix and Hoffman are strident and vociferous, Amy Adams is internal and subtle, but always at the brim. Peggy Dodd is multifaceted and extremely complex. Adams understands her amazingly well, making intricate features that are surprising for ""good-girl"" Adams. She gets dirty and dominating in not only a prolific manner but in a sultry method. Adams is a revelation. Laura Dern is brief but memorable; a missed actress who should be doing more accessible work.Jonny Greenwood's score once again, it's absolutely brilliant, well- placed, astonishing and among the best composers this year. Mihai Malaimare, Jr., cinematographer extraordinaire, is just that, extraordinary. Malaimare is painting scenes on a film canvas and we are witnessing the artist work. It's as if we're watching Bob Ross teach us the art of capture. Expect Cinematography to be named among Oscar's lineup in 2013 along with Film Editing (Leslie Jones, Peter McNulty) and Production Design (David Crank and Jack Fisk). It goes without saying, Picture, Director, and Screenplay should be there alongside them.The Scientology subject is there and there are connections that can be made but are they obvious or intended? Not necessarily. It's not evident or offensive. I only hope that Paul Thomas Anderson and the film doesn't suffer from anyone assuming that its a slight at the group or any particular one for that matter.Though the film takes time to warm up to, once the film soars, it's soars high. While The Master is not for everyone and there could be many detractors, there are three scenes in particular that are masterpieces in filmmaking. Anderson levels and executes a difficult subject with no fear or hesitation. He also knows his characters, what they are, who they are, and marrying the actors to them in a way not many directors can do. Anderson unites film with art again and The Master is their bond. It's good to see them together again."
3,The Master,9,7 October 2012,This is extremely difficult for me. Let me just start.,"Yes, herein contains some of the most ravishing filmmaking of the new millennium. The period details are abstract yet precise. The score has a stark, primordial allure. It's post-WWII America: Psychologically scarred veterans attempt to cramp themselves back into society. One is loner Freddie Quell, adrift in emotional confusion. He's secured a gig as a portrait photographer at a lavish department store imagined like a temple of indulgent commercialism. But Freddie doesn't last long there. In the darkroom, he screws models and chugs rotgut he makes with photo chemicals. Ultimately, he loses it on a customer, not just hitting him but harassing and lambasting him, working out some indecipherable, irrepressible rage.Phoenix's performance as Freddie reduces all he's done before to a preparation exercise. He longs for something, but even he can't tell you what, and that sorrow has clotted into self- destructive ritual. We see his snarly face from angles we haven't seen before. We're not sure if his leery eyes are hateful or if he's dead inside. He's a captivating animal.Then he meets stout, articulate Lancaster Dodd, always circled by people who treat him like a prodigy, hanging on his every word, laughing at all his mugging. Lancaster fancies himself a renaissance man. He's married to Peggy, who's much more vigilant than we first think. His son trails the proceedings with a dormant pose of derision. His daughter marries a man who, like everyone else in their clique, views him as a wizard.The film belongs to Phoenix, but Hoffman more than does his thing, his affectations ringing with conceit and fraudulence. Freddie---father dead, mother institutionalized---is naturally drawn to Dodd, who promises answers, mental freedom, happiness, even claims to cure leukemia. He's written a book his bootlickers treat as a sort of bible. He loves to charm and perform.It's well-known that Lancaster's cult is inspired by L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology. It's not direct, but the manner in which Lancaster draws Freddie into the fold, among other things, is unmistakably influenced by the contentious institution and Hubbard's life. Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't bind to that inspiration for his movie...but he doesn't bind to anything, really. You walk out muddled, wearied, wondering where to start in connecting the dots in this elegant, arresting movie. The story is as confounding as its technique is magnificent.Anderson, the true wunderkind of the Tarantino generation, sets everything up so beautifully, you wait for the turning point to prevail so the intrigue can come to boil. Instead, nothing progresses. The dramatic developments seem to dwindle and become less consistent as the movie drifts along, and Anderson throws in pauses, like a lingering desert scene or an outstretched montage in which Freddie is made to pace in a room, that slow the movie to a drudge. Freddie's sex preoccupation, which was stressed in the film's early stretch, grows dissonant. It's less about narrative arc and more the emotional condition of two men, a twist of trust and mistrust, id and superego. PTA's vision is grand in scope, but his result is not so much ambiguous as opaque and detached.For the first time in his immaculate career, the greatest filmmaker of his generation seems to languish. His newfound frigidness makes the film easy to admire but difficult to love. Anderson is so stunningly impressive, in fact, that it's taken me two viewings of The Master to admit all this to myself. Understandably, some critics have patronized it as deliberately evasive and occult, but isn't that just double-talk? A glorification of an artist's failure to proportionately bear his ideas? Something particularly intriguing is how the movie poses questions not so much about the importance of faith, but how far the human limit for change can extend and to confront emotional devastation so heavy it can never recover. But the film is too ambivalent or cautious to probe them in depth. By the end, it's become an opaque challenge between two phenomenal actors whose commitment to their roles is awe-inspiring, but it's manacled to a work so in awe of itself, the audience gets blockaded."
4,The Master,9,15 September 2012,Cements Paul Thomas Andreson as the most consistent director working today,"In a broad sense, The Master tells the story of a soulless drifter, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix,) constantly drunk and with no purpose in life, finding sanctuary in the company of The Cause, a cult-like group lead by a charismatic intellectual, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman.) This plot description does not do the film full justice, because with this film, Anderson fully releases himself from the constraints of traditional narrative storytelling. The film is told in a stream-of-consciousness style, loosely linking together vignettes and moments from the time these two men spend together, without any sense of ""drive,"" ""purpose"" or ""goal"" in the traditional screen writing sense. It is a style perfectly befitting the emotional and spiritual state of the main character, Freddie, adrift in life with no anchor or sense of purpose of his own. Throughout the film, Anderson occasionally cuts back to a shot of the wake of a slow-moving ship, placing us, the audience, aimlessly drifting through the narrative, just as Freddie is. What results is a series of scenes, snapshots of events, some narratively linked and some not. The film is very subjective, and puts us squarely in Freddie Quell's mind; as a result, no easy answers are given, many questions remain mysteries, and we never get a firmly grounded sense of reality; many events remain ambiguous and keep us wondering as to their fidelity long after the film is over.The Master is Anderson's most cinematically humble film yet. Gone are the sweeping camera moves, rapid-fire editing and high style of his previous films; even the slow, meticulous, beautifully lit tracking shots of There Will Be Blood are gone. Instead, Anderson submits to a wholly utilitarian shooting style, only moving the camera when necessary to capture action in the shot, and using formal framing techniques and naturalistic (but still very beautiful) lighting to comment on the characters' internal states. That said, it would be impossible to talk about the film's visual style without commenting on Anderson and cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s decision to shoot on 65mm film. This film stock, especially when projected in 70mm, provides the film with an unprecedented sense of clarity and sharpness. The 65mm lenses provide a very unique and distinctly shallow depth of field that adds to the dream-like quality of the film, and helps emphasize the isolation the characters feel. It would be a crime to watch the film on any other format.All this discussion about non-narrative elements, thematic overtones and film formats is not to minimize what is possibly the film's crowning and most long-lasting achievement: the performances. Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of the most consistent performers working today and an Anderson regular, delivers another powerful, charismatic performance in line with his turn in Doubt. It is, for the most part, an effectively subtle performance, maintaining a controlled dignity peppered with the occasional outburst. Amy Adams delivers a similarly dignified performance. Her character is mostly quiet, observing from the sidelines, but she has her moments to shine in the aforementioned private scenes between her and Lancaster, in which she completely dominates him. But the highlight of the film is without a doubt Joaquin Phoenix's tremendous performance as Freddie Quell. Over the years, Phoenix has, without much fanfare, slowly but surely cemented himself as one of the best actors working today, with powerful turns in many varied films, from his deliciously villains turn as emperor Commodus in Gladiator to his quiet, grave personification of Johnny Cash in Walk the Line. Now, after a four-year absence from narrative films, he returns with what is undoubtedly a career best performance, and one that, with any luck, will win him a much-deserved Oscar. His utter and complete immersion in the character of Freddie Quell has to be seen to be believed. His back hunched, swinging his arms like an ape, his frame thin, his face twisted and distorted, mumbling and slurring his speech out of the corner of his mouth like he is just learning how to behave in society for the first time, and failing. And Phoenix' physical commitment to the performance doesn't stop there, either: he flings himself into scenes of raw violence that look and feel completely real. It is a crowning achievement in the art of acting and ""the method,"" rivaling that of Daniel Day-Lewis in Anderson's previous film, and it further cements the biggest difference between Anderson and Stanley Kubrick as directors: Where Kubrick is known for his actors' cold, removed performances, Anderson has become the most consistent source for high-caliber Acting with a capital A.It's hard to really explain what makes The Master work even though it lacks many traditional narrative elements that provide most other films with powerful drama, closure and immediate gratification. It's a very subjective experience, and I'm sure many viewers will have difficulty immersing themselves in the film without the typical sense of narrative progression and character goals. For this reason, The Master is probably Anderson's least accessible film. That said, I think it is a testament to Anderson's enormous intellect and directorial abilities that he managed to capture the attentions and fascination of so many viewers and critics. He certainly won me over; although I had more visceral and immediately satisfying reactions to Anderson's previous films, I find that The Master lingers on long after the lights went up in the theater. The film's intellectual ambitions, along with its very unique, eerie tone, will keep me mulling over the experience for days to come. Already I feel the urge to re-visit it and attempt to uncover more of the film's secrets. And that right there is a telltale sign of an instant classic film in the making."
5,The Master,8,27 September 2012,The Master of his fate,"Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" is a puzzling, often bewildering film. Very few films have left me shaken and stirred and still leave me wondering, ""What was that all about?"" I can't say that I hated the ride. It is, quite simply, a remarkable film from one of America's best filmmakers today. This film is not for everyone, however.The film's center plot; the one about self-described nuclear physicist, philosopher and professor Lancaster Dodd and his ""organization"" ""The Cause"" - as seen from the point of view from a shell-shocked psychotic drunk Freddie Quell. During the course of the film Lancaster and Freddie bond somewhat with Lancaster progressing his latest works.The main performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman are superb, and should warrant both of them Academy Award Nominations for Best Actor. Both of them. Phoenix is literally on fire here, his quirky mannerisms, twitching lips, unforgiving, unsettling eyes and ferocious anger and voice had me on the edge every time I see him on screen. Hoffman also is more subtle, though we see growing anger and rage whenever he feels that his work is being threatened. He can be classy, charismatic, and when threatened, loses all of that and becomes about as desperate as Freddie. Brilliant work by both actors. Watch the scene where Lancaster gets through to Freddie, or the harrowing scene where both of them are in jail cells. Special mention to Amy Adams who, while not really standing out, gives off a peculiar and somewhat sinister aura whenever she's on the screen.Anderson's solid screenplay and his concentrated direction bring the goods. There seems to be a pattern about Anderson's last three films including this one. Both ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" featured lead characters who are extremely lonely and prone to snap to anger. ""The Master"" is somewhat a bit of both, where the lonely man can be both psychotic without reason and yet there are scenes which show he is, after all, a man. Some very well written lines (""If you can find peace without looking up to a master, any master..."") meshed with some really great cinematography by Mihai Malaimare Jr. that brings nice color tones to the 1950 production design. Complementing all of this is Jonny Greenwood's eerie, dissonant score which makes the movie all the more odd, unsettling, and yet compelling to watch.Eventually, both men in the movie are the masters of their own fate, and Anderson his own. It may move some and it may turn away others, but this is a fascinating watch nonetheless. ""The Master"" is one of 2012's very best films.Overall: 91%"
6,The Master,10,3 November 2012,P.T. Anderson makes another under appreciated masterpiece,"Often in the history of film there have been remarkable gems, hailed by few and ignored by the masses. Over time many of these gain the credit they deserve, Citizen Kane was panned by many critics at the time and only with the passing of time has its influence and brilliance been generally acknowledged. P.T. Anderson's new film The Master may not be Citizen Kane but it is certainly in the same vein. As Orson Welles modeled Charles Foster Kane after William Randolph Hearst, Anderson's new film focuses on another controversial historical figure, L. Ron Hubbard. Like Welles, Anderson treats his characters with the same mixture of examination and empathy that leaves you questioning pre- conceptions and wondering what truly defines an individual.In post-war America Freddie Quell (played by Joaquin Phoenix) , a former soldier with an abnormal libido and a hobby of making near toxic alcohol, is wandering through life like an actor oblivious of his stage. His course takes a slight detour when he wakes up aboard a ship with Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his followers who make up ""The Cause"", a cult-ish religion clouded in the guise of science, philosophy and psychology. Dodd sees in Quell the opportunity to display the power of his new methods, and in Dodd Quell sees a mentor and hope for answers to the questions that plague all humanity.Like many of Anderson's films the pace can often be trying and the often surreal visions expounded are certainly not for everyone's taste. Images of swirling water are only a drop in the bucket of metaphors Anderson buries his audience in. Like Anderson's last film, 2007's There Will Be Blood, gorgeous imagery and an eerie score help create a dream-like sense of bewilderment that stays with you long after the lights go up and the popcorn is stale.Anderson's ability to craft film as art is only matched by his eye for talent. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in his fifth collaboration with Anderson, plays Dodd with wonderful simplicity that allows the complexity of the character speak for itself. With subtly and reserve Hoffman lets his character's egotism and magnetism shine through Anderson's typically biting dialogue. Joaquin Phoenix, still recovering from his 2010 film debacle I'm Still Here, gives a powerhouse performance reminding us all what was so intriguing to begin with. Somehow Phoenix makes a character who should come off as a simpleton violent alcoholic a very empathetic and human individual. In the end he is still not very likable, like many people in this world, but you can nevertheless sympathize with his mortal struggle. Whether or not Phoenix will get the Best Actor Oscar as many have discussed is still anyone's guess, especially with the multi-Oscar winning Daniel Day Lewis (who won his second Oscar for Anderson's There Will Be Blood) in the competition. Rounding out the cast is Office darling Amy Adams as Dodd's wife Peggy, who has a far more pragmatic view of the relationship between Dodd and Quell.It is a tragedy how often brilliance is not recognized by those in its presence. P.T. Anderson with masterpieces like Boogie Nights, Magnolia and There Will Be Blood under his belt would surely be Oscar material, but he is not. After the fall when Spielberg and all the other mainstream directors release their fare Anderson's little art film will receive little attention. He may get a nod with yet another nomination, but the sad truth is that his work may simply be ahead of his time. Just as his films are too ""arty"" for mainstream box office success the Oscars are too mainstream for him. So maybe he won't get the award until he's thirty years deep like Scorsese or perhaps never at all, but perhaps that's okay. After all he is in good company, there have been other perfectionist film makers who never won the Best Director statue, like Orson Welles."
7,The Master,10,11 October 2012,Two very different men try to fulfill one another.,"Unquestionably P.T. Anderson's best film so far. I've always liked his work, but early on I had no sense he would achieve heights such as this. Let me say this, Anderson, ALONE, I think amongst relatively big-budget American filmmakers, allows his imagery to play by its own rules. EVERY other studio filmmaker- from Scorsese to Tarantino, to Jarmusch, plays by some kind of pre-established rules-even if they are the pre-established rules of ""art cinema"" or ""second cinema"". Anderson, like Weerasthakul or Bela Tarr, speaks his own tongue. I thought There Will Be Blood was pretty great, but this is Truly Great- a singularly challenging work of art. Similarly, I would compare Daniel Day-Lewis's work in Blood with Phoenix's work here. The former was impressive, creative, witty. The latter is brave, adventuresome, and merciless. More than any of the ""canonical"" ""method"" performances of cinema, I think Phoenix reaches into places of himself, of all of us, that's very unearthing demands new philosophical questions. Here's my take, for what it's worth, of the ""meaning"" of the film. It's a comparison of two drastically contradictory and complementary personalities. One wants to live without any Master by becoming a Master himself. The other wants a master to give some kind of shape to his life. L. Ron Hubbard- inspired guru Lancaster Dodd (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman in a performance that's beautiful but not ground-breaking) is a con-man, but as I read him, he's not exactly a charlatan. He truly wants to believe the (self-serving) things he's saying, and he needs other people to believe them too. He's very successful at (least the latter half of) this. But this does not make him free. Instead, it turns him into a kind of King and, as we know from the example of Louis XVI, any sovereign is ultimately a privileged prisoner of his/her subjects. They are exempt from the laws of the land, of life, exactly in so far as others believe they are. Dodd's ""freedom"" from mastery is wholly dependent on the worship of the other, an other outstandingly represented by Phoenix's Freddie Quell, a potentially unbreakable ""scoundrel"" who Dodd both fears and admires as such. Quell is a completely, irredeemably, broken individual, whose only surviving qualities are sheer animal instinct- screw, eat, and drink. He yearns to be put back together, to be mastered by some other, to serve some sovereign and thus be welcomed back into civilization. But he's too far gone, or too savage, for that to work. He can't be mastered, even by any coherent sense of self. Dodd seeks the solitude of the sublime but is ultimately made completely dependent on the Other, while Quell, very unwillingly, achieves the freedom, and loneliness, of God."
8,The Master,2,29 November 2013,P.T. wallows in his B.M.,"This is one of those pretentious films that a lot of Anderson fans will claim achieves some kind of grace, but all it does is bore. Anderson has seriously gone too far with the languid shots that just on on forever, because he loves that. And go ahead and love Anderson if you have the time to watch very little happen for well over two hours.Sure, the story could have been an intriguing expose on the emergence of Scientology and other cults after WWII-- and of course the Scientology folks would never allow it to be named specifically-- but all it says is that crazy people follow other crazy people. Anderson does draw out excellent performances from Phoenix and Hoffman, but they spend so much damn time just looking and walking around. Because that gives the film nuance, sure.Anderson even inserts his own inside joke about his films, when The Master publishes his second verbose tome and a critic says he could have cut it down to 3 pages. Anderson did well to bring in a sweet romance, ""Punch-Drunk Love"", in 90 minutes, and that film was fulfilling. This is just a bunch of dreck the producers are indulging so that Anderson can win the favor of equally pretentious fans."
9,The Master,1,6 October 2012,I feel as though I am one of the cause,"I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and appreciate most of the other recognizable actor s in this film. This film is too long, too boring, and meanders like a mid-western river. I kept waiting and waiting for the story line to pick up, but it was at it's peak on the floor. Amy Adams played a great antagonist, but her role was stunted. Joaquin Pheonix did well to play an alcoholic with a few cards shy of a deck, but hasn't everyone played that role well? Hoffman was not so disappointing as his material was just not that good. This was not a story line worth making into a movie. I wrote a better ending walking out of the movie theater. After the master proclaims we all have our masters, Freddie bashes in his head with a white statuette. The antagonist returns to the room to find the new master in the chair and she smiles. To heap any platitudes on this movie is to become one with the cause. Stay home, save your money, clean your toilets."
10,The Master,10,15 September 2012,Oh Master !,"I don't remember when was the last time I got so engrossed in a film that the ending felt like snapping out of a trance. Remarkable in every detail but the detail I appreciate the most is the acting, if one can call it that. Joaquin Phoenix introduced us to a character I had never seen before on the screen. I was compelled, mesmerized. A sensation I hadn't experience since Colin Firth gave us Adrian LeDuc in 1989's ""Apartment Zero"". A total original but solidly planted in a reality that is undeniable. Shattering. Love him or hate him, he's not asking for sympathy on the contrary. He is defiant. Philip Seymour Hoffman adds another spellbinding character to his already extraordinary collection. And you, Mr. Anderson, who are you? Long Live The Cinema!"
11,The Master,9,14 October 2012,My Simple Analysis,"I didn't know much of L. Ron Hubbard or Scientology coming into this movie but I knew a few things.As the film progressed and the strangeness and lack of plot/hook continued apace I started to piece together in my mind what was going on, and what I came up with is this:Freddie Quell, the Joaquin Phoenix drifter in this film, is the Id-driven alter ego component of Lancaster Dodd/Hubbard (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Quell's life is, in fact, the same as Dodd's as they inhabit the same persona.Dodd is wrestling with his demons and his ambitions and Quell represents the Id persona Dodd/Hubbard had to leave behind in order to fulfill his self-fulfilling prophecy of purity apart from animal instincts.This explains the closeness of the two characters, the frequent twin-ism on screen (one example: the two of them wrestling when Quell returns) and the strangeness of the plot: the plot IS Hubbard/Dodd's quest to purify himself. Quell pacing back and forth between wall and window is part of that process.Going back and looking at the movie and researching L. Ron Hubbard it also makes sense for Anderson to split the Master character's duality into two separate characters as Hubbard seems very clearly to have been a split personality character himself.When Hubbard/Dodd goes off to sea the metaphor is that he has to leave the Id and animal instincts on shore. This explains the (spoiler alert) ending: Quell on the shore, no longer hung up on sex, but stuck in his animal instincts nonetheless, repeating lines from Hubbard/Dodd and finally left behind on the sand with a female nipple sand sculpture: the Id is abandoned and Dodd's Ego and Superego (Amy Adams, his wife) are on the sea.Quell's name is chosen carefully, just as carefully as this film is constructed."
12,The Master,1,11 November 2012,Poor Film Making,"I saw the The Master today and was greatly disappointed & here are some of my thoughts.Joaquin Phoenix is probably to old to play the part of a returning seaman from WW2. He's in his med to late 30""s and the vast majority of sailors were in their late teens or early twenties at wars end, little more the kids fighting wars! Also the accounts I've read about navy life state that ""odd balls"" were weeded out pretty quickly as they had a detrimental effect on morale. Maybe his character had enlisted straight after Pearl Harbour in late 1941 & they were taking 30+ year olds at that desperate time & his mental illness wasn't apparent? Anyway he just appears to old for the part.The promotion of the film suggests that it's about a cult leader and how he manipulates, after all the film is called The Master. Yet the film is not about Hoffman's character but Phoenix's so maybe it should be titled ""A Troubled Mind"" the diary of a sick violent alcoholic?I don't know if we have received a different cut of the film here in Australia but Amy Adams has only a very slight role in the film with only two significant moments. One where she is stimulating Hoffman & another near the end of the film in England. She is grossly under- utilised.Phoenix's character is painful, watching this performance was what I would think it would be like sitting next to Charles Manson on a flight from Sydney to London. The flights around 22 hours and the film feels like the same time span. As other reviews have pointed out the story line is, lets say, unclear and drifts. I've always thought Darryl F Zanuck was onto something when he would cut any & all scenes that didn't move the story forward, in this case that's a lot of cut scenes.I was also annoyed that the Hoffman character was only briefly challenged directly about his teachings. I feel that this was a wasted opportunity to examine a cult behaving under pressure. Instead we only see the reaction of the mentally unwell violent Phoenix character.What a shame, this could have been an interesting examination of how cults build & work but instead we got an incoherent ramblings from a writer director that in my view has only delivered one film of note.One last thing, 26 people started watching the film, 8 walked out, 3 fell asleep & from what I could gauge no one enjoyed it. I saw 2 people encouraging the group waiting for the next session to exchange their tickets for anything else."
13,The Master,9,19 February 2013,*Spoilers* The Master may not convert you but it did convince me,"From the first second the movie gets going it becomes clear that Paul Thomas Anderson's ''The Master'' is not a war movie, it's not an action flick or comedy although there are some great laughs here and there. There will always be those who will go into a movie theater no matter what's being shown, hoping for some orgasmic CGI display coupled with a plot whose sole purpose is to validate the viewer's basic moral beliefs.So to give you an idea of what the film is about(spoilers): Freddie Quell is returning home from the pacific theater in WWII, traumatized and sick of the world. His attempts to fit into society, moderate his drinking of dubious potions of alcohol he brews himself, have a normal, healthy relationship and work as a photographer all fail miserably. He ends up on a yacht after being forced on the run and meets Lancester Dodd, The Master and leader of a cult organization called The Cause. Now this film is obviously partly a critique of Scientology. Hoffman's got a good resemblance to Hubbard's physique, his character also claims to be a nuclear physicist and i believe the name ''The Cause'' is a subtle parody of CoS, the abbreviation most commonly used for The Church of Scientology.Now although the movie is a satire of CoS and maybe religion in general i find it to be so much more. It's easy to see the film as simply the struggle and friendship between Freddie and Dodd, master and slave, yin and yang. The charismatic and secretive cult leader vs the demented and aggressive vagabond. If you'd ask me i'd say that the film is mostly about Freddie after all, there's a very dreamy quality to a lot of the narrative and it seems PTA is taking his lessons from Kubrick and Lynch in exploring Freddie's trauma. Freddie's journey from battleship to cult-commanded yacht, the captain metaphors everywhere(there's even a small statue of a captain behind a steering wheel on Lancester's desk near the end of the film), the dream scene and the scene near the end with Freddie lying on the beach all imply that there's something going on behind the curtains.Although a lot of the film heavily resembles ''There Will Be Blood'', this film is(fittingly) more mystical and open to interpretation. (spoilers) perhaps it's symbolic that Freddie escapes from The Cause in the desert after serving his master on the sea. There's even a scene where Lancester refers to him as 'his little soldier' and people honestly say that the film is pretentious. Really? Even if this whole art-house thing might turn you off i've got to add that this film's got some amazing performances, especially from Phoenix. Anyways, if you don't mind a slow pace and a film that relies on(great) acting instead of gimmicks i'm sure The Master is something for you, unless perhaps if it insults your personal beliefs in which case there's nothing this review will do to change your mind."
14,The Master,8,22 March 2013,Conquering the minds of the every-day people in order to achieve a self-nurtured and a self-visionary goal and attain true inner happiness and a state of pure content.,"Firstly, not exactly sure If reading this review will reveal the plot, but yea, ""SPOILER ALERT""Starting-off, this film is about conquering the minds of the every-day people in order to achieve a self-nurtured and a self-visionary goal. The concept of following one man's dreams or belief for the hopes to achieve true inner happiness and a state of pure content.Set in the Post-World War II, The main character Freddie Quell(Joaquin Phoenix) is an extremely dis-oriented human being with strange and uncommon thoughts and human-behavior. His style of thinking quite unique and compelling although he is unable to achieve any sort of goal in any manner considered small or big. This is where things change for him when he stumbles upon The Master Lancaster Dodd(Philip Seymour Hoffman). Dodd has the ability to read people by their behavioral tendencies and finds something uniquely special with Freddie. Dodd consciously or sub-consciously decides to alter/change/treat Freddie's mind & mechanism of thinking for what he considers would result in a more happier more for filled and satisfied way of spending a lifetime for Freddie.Freddie, after going through varied kinds of hardships and even turmoil under the guidance of The Master eventually realizes that although he is in a manner recovering mentally, the idea of existing around Dodd and his (possibly misguided) theories may be his undoing and decides to leave and start anew.Dodd's methods which involve a understanding one's super-natural* state of being, which links us to our past lives and our future and that our problems are a result of it originating billions of years ago are very effective for some reason and through his books he influences the minds of people in a deadly way for what he believes to be rightfully true. His methods do seem very questionable and objectionable. Although he has most of the people following him with absolute belief, the theory that he has engineered methods which can be applied to solve all the worlds problems is dangerously close to insanity & could do more harm in the longer run than good. An entire generation may resort to his teachings only to cause damage to their succeeding generation(s).Watch this film closely and consider its teachings but also remember that we watch films to entertain our selves. So yea, Enjoy :)"
15,The Master,1,31 December 2012,Pointless,"I don't even know where to begin. I think it's because this movie really has no sense of direction. It's like waking up in a fog bank: you don't really know where to go.Yeah, it's a story of the beginning of a cult, so it's not going to make much sense. I get it. But they go beyond that to make it a really bad movie. The big problem is they put the plot focus on the mentally unstable character Freddie Quall, played by Joaquin Phoenix. The problem with Quall is he's not really disturbing (which could be fascinating, see Hannibal Lecter), but just disturbed. You can't make a movie surrounding a character like that! He's not ""compelling"", he's not ""interesting"", he's just sad. The writers made a terrible blunder by making this guy TOO disturbed, so disturbed you feel like you're staring at a homeless guy, trying to figure out when he's going to eat his own feces. That makes YOU the creepy one! This, and other choices by the filmmakers, makes ""The Master"" a sloppy, unwatchable mess. Besides focusing too much on Quall's lunacy, it skips & jumps around and just when you think it's going to get interesting or deep they skip along to something else. Then it starts this homoerotic undercurrent and then just ... ends.I wouldn't even call it a good allegory on Scientology or other cults. It is almost worthless in that regard, there's only a few moments that show the malicious intent of groups like this, but then they swoop back to Phoenix acting disturbed again. I suppose I could say Philip Seymour Hoffman does a good job playing cult leader Lancaster Dodd. I wish he was the actual focus of the movie, but for whatever reason, the filmmakers decided not to do that.Regardless, we spent a good hour afterward complaining about how bad this movie was, and that ended up being the best part of it."
16,The Master,10,15 September 2012,A Film Among Films,"Superb should be the opening word. And as it is usually the case, not everyone is bound to agree. The confidence of Paul Thomas Anderson is out of this world. In ""Boogie Nights"" he gave us an unrepeatable Mark Whalberg, here is Joaquin Phoenix's turn. Amazing performance that will go next to three other performances that revolutionized the art of acting and create characters that were unique in every way. James Mason in ""Lolita"", Anthony Perkins in ""Psycho"" and even Colin Firth in ""Apartment Zero"" Coincidentally or not none of those three landmarks were nominated for Oscars, let's hope Joaquin Phoenix this time breaks that tradition. Everything about this film will make your jaw drop and I don't want to tell you anything about the film itself because part of my delight consisted on the fact I didn't know anything about the story. Don't miss it. See it in the biggest screen you can find."
17,The Master,3,17 September 2012,Most disappointing film of the year,"I know, everyone is gushing about this movie. That, on top of the fact that I am a PT Anderson fan (Magnolia, for one, is probably a top 10 favorite of mine), is what made this so disappointing.First, the good. Amy Adams does very well in a supporting role. The whole thing is beautifully filmed, and I liked the music as well. I thought it captured the feel of the time period very well.On to the bad (of which there is substantially more, in my view). I'll start with the plot. There is almost none, and the movie has no hook. It never made me forget I was sitting in a movie theater. Its pace is maddeningly slow, and it is too long. A good portion of the film is spent watching Phoenix walk back and forth between a window and a wall for reasons that remain rather opaque. Yes, it's that kind of movie.I didn't care at all about Phoenix's character or Hoffman's, and despite the rave reviews, I think neither actor brought their A-game to this one. Their characters were one dimensional, unsympathetic, and unrelatable. They didn't feel like real people. They don't really change much over the course of the movie.What irked me most, though, was that the movie really didn't have anything to say. It had no real insights into anything. It didn't make me think or challenge my mind in any way.When a movie fails to make me think or feel, as this one did, I can't help but regret spending money on it."
18,The Master,10,4 February 2013,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Paul Thomas Anderson's hypnotic masterpiece featuring a tour de force from Joaquin Phoenix,"The Master is the latest film by American filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. The movie comes after a gap of five years following Anderson's highly successful outing in There Will Be Blood (2007). The Master stars Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams in pivotal roles. Anderson is one of the few commercial filmmakers alive today who write their own screenplays. And perhaps that's the reason why he has not been very prolific as a filmmakeryielding only once every 4-5 years. The Master also marks the return of Joaquin Phoenix from a self-imposed acting break. The movie presents the tale of Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix)a WWII Naval veteran on the brink of a mental breakdown. Freddie belongs to the dying breed of war veterans which finds it hard to adjust to the sanities of a post-war civilized world. The excruciating pain and mental trauma that a soldier experiences during a war is irreversible and often enough to drive him crazy. Freddie has had a troubled past but the war has broken him completely. Freddie's pitiful, perverted mental state can be best described by the two bizarre scenes presented at the beginning of the film. In the first one, Freddie is shown masturbating in front of a sand sculpture of a woman which he perversely seems to use as a substitute for a love doll. In the second one, Freddie is shown imbibing a certain fluid (most likely gasoline) directly from the fuel tank of a Navy vessel. Freddie is dipsomaniac with a morbid liking for dangerous cocktail drinks which he prepares by mixing alcohol with toxic substances like paint thinner. After being fired from a couple of jobs because of his irascible behavior, Freddie stows away on the private yacht of Lancaster Dodd aka ""The Master"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Dodd is the charismatic leader of a philosophical movement called ""The Cause"". Freddie's life changes for ever after meeting Dodd. For the second time in his life (after his stint in the US Navy), Quell sees a cause worth fighting for. He begins to show a kind of jingoistic fervor for ""The Cause"". Anyone who dares to oppose ""The Master"" and his preaching will have to first deal with him. What follows is a hypnotic journey of self-realization which will either consume Quell or will make him the true master of his fate.The Master is a multifaceted work of cinema that can be enjoyed at so many levels. The Master has a sense of randomness attached to it that makes it a very difficult film to interpret. It may appear to have several interweaved layers to one viewer, and yet appear completely hollow to anotherdepending purely on the viewer's understanding and interpretation. The Master works well on both the technical and emotional frontsanother rarity for an American film. The movie's cinematography, music and editing are all topnotch, and complement each other really well.The acting is awe-inspiring to say the least and is quite easily one of the strongest points of the movie. Also, there's enough room for character development. While the relationship that Quell and Dodd share is explicitly platonic in nature, an undercurrent of homosexual impulse cannot be ruled out. Joaquin Phoenix is electrifying in the role of a lifetime. He takes great pains in conjuring up his self-loathing, verminous, reclusive alter ego as he himself gets lot in the role. Philip Seymour Hoffman is outstanding in the role of Lancaster Dodd and steals each and every scene he is a part of. Anderson elicits strong performances from the supporting cast especially Amy Adams who is an absolute treat to watch as Dodd's demanding wife, Peggy.Overall, The Master is an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that may require multiple viewings to grasp its deeper meanings. The Master is undoubtedly the best film to have come out of the English-speaking world in the year 2012. It's a real shame that the Academy yet again failed to identify a cinematic gem. The fact that the movie has not been nominated in the Best Picture category only substantiates the ineptness of the Academy in segregating topnotch cinema from the heaps of mediocrity. The Master, like most of Anderson's movies, is not meant for everyone. A casual viewer is ought to be disappointed, for he may find it drab and utterly boring. But, The Master will most definitely succeed in satisfying the deepest cravings of an intelligent viewer. Highly recommended! 10/10"
19,The Master,1,17 November 2012,Slow boat to nowhere,"Well, I really wanted to like this one. On paper it's perfect. Director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson, cast headed by Joaquin Phoenix, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams. What could go wrong? The script. If a movie doesn't start with a good script, it can't turn out well. There is no crest to this story. And there is no denouement. It lays flat for over two hours. The actors give great performances and the scenes are constructed well. Joaquin Phoenix has moments that are tragic. And then the movie just plods on. I am fine with a film that develops slowly. I'm not fine with a film that never develops. Is it about an alcoholic? No. Is it about a cult leader? No. It's random moments, between an alcoholic and a cult leader, strung together, with no direction, and no narrative. You could extract any scene from this film, and on it's own it would stand up well. Pieced together, however, they don't add up to a story. A story has to be about something. It has to start somewhere and it has to go somewhere. This story starts, and then goes nowhere. It is fine if the resolution of a story is simply it's endlessness. This film, however, never establishes where it's going. And, therefore, can't simply, go on forever. It never went anywhere to begin with. The actors are left to spluge all over the audience for no discernible reason. I'm over Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and have been for a while. In this role, as a sort of L. Ron Hubbard figure, he overacts to the point of caricature. For my money, the best Seymour Hoffman is ""Boogie Nights"", ""Happiness"", or ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". Joaquin Phoenix is probably the most talented American actor working today, but his physically contorted, repetitive, mentally tortured, alcoholic, Freddie Quell, was never given the opportunity to become real or sympathetic, or even vile. He just, like the rest of the movie, went on, and on, and on. This actor, Joaquin Phoenix, has the chops to do anything. Check him out in ""Reservation Road"", ""Gladiator"", ""Walk The Line"", and his BEST, ""Two Lovers"". In ""Two Lovers"" Phoenix draws the portrait of an emotionally crippled man whose life crumbles beyond all hope (in his eyes), but through an accident of fate finds a path through which to go on living. He is riveting. There isn't anything he can't do given the opportunity. But he doesn't get the opportunity here.Clearly this film was trying to comment on cultism. We know too much, however (Jonestown, Waco, Warren Jeffs), about cults to accept this fraction of a story. Clearly the main character was an alcoholic. Yet the film never explored his turmoil, or addiction, the way even a dumb show like ""Celebrity Rehab"" would. We were almost brought close enough to his story to care during his first session with Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but that was not developed and ultimately went nowhere. Just like the rest of the film.There are some shocking scenes in this film. But there is no story that justifies them. It is like watching a big screen version of ""Americas Most Shocking Videos"", - for over two hours. They are independently compelling, but ultimately disconnected. And they never amount to a story about anything I could wrap my arms around. For me the ultimate failure of this film is that there was no point to it. It is not an art film. It is a pointless film. And it's not that I don't get ""it"". There's nothing to get. Better to spend your time watching car crashes, on TV, shot from dash cams. At least you won't expect much going in."
20,The Master,1,21 September 2012,Ridiculous,"Certainly the worst film I have seen this year and contender for the bottom 10 of all time, this was uninteresting, poorly directed and frankly rather annoying and pretentious. The acting was okay and could have been good if they hadn't had such poor direction. The music was intrusive, particularly at the beginning (you should never notice a good film score, but you couldn't escape from this one), the storyline was non-existent and the characters unsympathetic - a pretty lethal combination. When Phillip Seymour Hoffman started singing and all the females in the scene suddenly appeared naked, I just had to laugh and from then on, each idiotic new ""sensational"" set-up just made me laugh more. And it DRAGGED - the longest 137 minutes of my life. I would have walked out well before the end, but I was with my wife, who said the only reason she didn't walk out was that she wanted to see me suffer as payback for making her sit through ""The Tree of Life"", which oddly enough we both thought of as we endured this ""Modern American Classic"" - I suspect that the silliness on the beach brought it to mind. Why can't modern Directors (a) learn to edit properly and (b) entertain us? Appalling."
21,The Master,2,16 September 2012,A film half finished.,"I would like to say that I mean no disrespect to Paul Thomas Anderson. His contribution of ""Magnolia"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" to the world of cinema have been more than enough to forever place him permanently on the top 100 greatest filmmakers of all time list. These two masterpieces also forever forgive him for making his one great stinker, ""Punch Drunk Love.""Well, he made another stinker here with ""The Master,"" make no mistake about it. Here's a few thoughts on this film (which I'll say is worth seeing, unlike Punch Drunk Love).The acting is brilliant on all accounts. I think 90% of directing is casting, so PTA hit this one out of the park. All the other departments of the production were right on; but the most important department, the story portrayal, was just disregarded, almost offensively so. ""The Master"" is a great character piece. The actors did their homework. But the film is one giant character study- but with no coherent story. There's no spoilers in this review, because there's nothing to spoil. So I can't even go into the details if I wanted to. This movie is about a series of subplots that meander into nothing- juxtaposed with random, unmotivated nudity, and intense scenes where Joaquin Phoenix either beats someone's ass or you think he's going to beat someone's ass. Paul Anderson spends roughly 55% of the screen time developing the character of Lancaster Dodd (P.S. Hoffman) as this great writer, persuasive teacher and potential cult leader (much like L.Ron Hubbard), and then... ""ffffttt."" The other 45% of the film is spent very deliberately developing the character Freddie Quell (J. Phoenix) as a tormented raging alcoholic and disillusioned Navy vet... which also leads nowhere. Dodd tries to mentor Quell who desperately needs help- and he doesn't really succeed. Phil Hoffman starts to get a cult like following, gets arrested for something unclear, and so does Phoenix for resisting Hoffman's arrest, then poof- they're both out of jail and nothing is explained. The two men separate briefly, and Hoffman winds up in Europe and asks Phoenix to join him there. Phoenix joins Hoffman. Hoffman warns Phoenix never to leave again. Then Phoenix leaves and winds up on the beach caressing a naked female sand castle (mirroring the first scene in the film where Phoenix is molesting a naked female sand castle). The film ends here. This is why I say it's a film half finished. Sure there was complexity and duality in the twisted past of Phoenix and the intelligence of Hoffman's character; but none of it matters, because there's no payoff for any journey the characters go on. At the end of the day, it was just about Hoffman mentoring Phoenix off and on, and the two men loving and hating each other. That's it. (The great Amy Adams was poorly used in the film- and doesn't deserve mention)It's a familiar trend with Hollywood these days: The characters are fantastic but the story is unexplored and unmotivated. If PTA hadn't wrote and directed this, I would maybe give it a 4 or 5, as the casting was so strong. But a story-less movie can only be a maximum of 5 on my IMDb rating scale, even if Stanley Kubrick himself made it and sent it to us from the great beyond. This film had many great attempts at taking you on a journey, but always dropped the ball at every opportunity of beat, and started new, random, and unconnected threads that didn't mean anything. I don't buy the ""it's an art film"" b.s... or the idea that it's s a ""subjective piece"" that should be interpreted differently for everyone. That's horse crap- and the people who wrote the 9 and 10 star reviews know it. They are just under the spell of Hoffman's tremendous stage presence. Because let's face it, without Hoffman, this film doesn't work. We all know the ability Paul Anderson has to tell a profoundly original story while still being surreal, and using music to motivate plot turns. The ""Lets be surreal just for the sake of being surreal"" method doesn't work for him. Sorry Paul, you're not a Warhol, Lynch, or Von Trier- why even try? The subjective 2001 Space Odyssey films have been made already. We're bored of people imitating that. (at least I am). ""The Master"" is supposed to be based on John Huston's ""Let their be Light"" and loosely influenced by L. Ron Hubbard and the rise of Scientology, much like ""Citizen Kane"" was supposed to be about William Randolph Hearst. But try as it did, this was just a train wreck from the start. At no point did you get the feeling of a Scientology-esc uprising... or any kind of an uprising whatsoever. At least have the courage to show the cult rise to power- or come out and say that Hubbard was a frickin nut case. At least that would be saying something. This film says nothing. It keeps you guessing, and it's a huge let down when you realize the film is going to do the pretentious art thing and not explain anything. I don't know guys. I would wait for Netflix or Redbox on this one. Unless you enjoy paying a lot of money to be bored in public, with a few hundred strangers, all pretending to be blown away by nothingness... constantly waiting for the genius character performance of Hoffman and Phoenix to be engaged in a story. Why tease yourself?"
22,The Master,1,7 February 2014,Disgustingly pretentious film with no story,"I was a bit sceptic before I decided to watch The Master. I had seen There Will Be Blood, which was also directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and I did not like it. It was pretentious and the only reason people seemed to like it was because it was an unusual art house film. Unfortunately, The Master turned out to be even worse.The film sort of follows a man called Freddie Quell played by Joaquin Phoenix. He comes into contact with Lancaster Dodd played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Dodd is a cult leader and Freddy Quell falls for his charms, and that's basically the whole plot. It's just Philip Seymour Hoffman spouting idiotic lines and Joaquin Phoenix acting like a mentally handicapped person. Occasionally, Phoenix's character leaves the cult for no apparent reason only to return a few scenes later. The only thing the movie seems intent on conveying is that cults are weird and dangerous. Because of this the characters are shallow, their motivations unclear, and no one seems to behave normally. To a lot of people this is seen as an intelligent story, but to me it's like something a mentally ill child would write.Normally, in a film with a great cast but a weak story you can rely on good acting. Unfortunately, even that can't be enjoyed. Hoffman and Phoenix are good, and most of the supporting cast are reasonable. But if actors have to play characters with no purpose it's impossible to improve the quality of a film.After watching this film I asked myself what I had learned. My answer was nothing. How is this a good film? What makes the story good? To a lot of people it's probably because it's just different than most films. The great Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't need to tell a proper story, he doesn't need to direct his actors so that they can give good performances. Mr Anderson can just shoot some clichéd scenes, while great actors just do some nonsense, and he will be praised by the critics. Well, I have had it with this pretentious rubbish. This is certainly one of the worst films I have ever seen and I think I will avoid Anderson's films from now on."
23,The Master,,27 September 2013,This film has no interest in getting better,"This film tells the friendship between an alcoholic veteran and a master of a self improvement movement.Seeing how ""The Master"" won so many awards, I thought it would be good. Unfortunately, the plot is a confusing needs right from the start. The story jumps from one bit too another without adequate explanation, especially in the beginning. One minute Freddy is in a farm, the next minute on a boat then in a fancy hall. The story continues to confuse, and my biggest query is why the master makes healing Freddy his mission in the first place.The two most important characters, Freddy and the master, are both poorly depicted. I just do not care about them at all, and I don't care about their relationship either. The whole film becomes a super bite fest, and I can honestly quote Amy Adam's pivotal line that the film has no interest in getting better."
24,The Master,4,22 February 2014,Pretentious and Pointless - the sort of movie critics love but audiences hate.,"The Master is absorbingly acted in part, but ultimately goes around in circles without any real point. If it's meant to nail Scientology it fails in just about every respect. Although it apparently p****d Tom Cruise off, so it must be doing something right....This is the sort of movie actors love doing - lots of close-ups, meaningful glances, gesticulations, outbursts, etc. Are we meant to be entertained by this and this alone? What about story? Not much here to talk of, I'm afraid. About 60 minutes in it just disappears up its own backside.Love the Hollywood sexism - lot's of frontal female nudity. Zero male. There's even a scene in which all the women are naked and all the men clothed. Is Hollywood run by 14 year old kids with self pleasure fantasies?Seymour-Hoffman is very good, but in real life he now seems more like the mentally damaged war vet than the Master of a cult religion. Joaquin Phoenix overdoes the traumatised war service guy to a fault. Trying to talk like Marlon Brando is not great acting.The movie itself is ambiguous, with punctuated assaults on cultism but also implying that it's followers are not really all that sinister or brainwashed but choose to be where they are. It's really just stating the obvious. Only once is there any sort of debate in the film, and this is disappointingly handled. We never really learn why Seymour-Hoffman's character believes in what he does (or if he believes in what he does),nor does it address WHY people fall for this bull.One positive is the beautifully captured period look. The photography is splendid.The critics liked it but it was a box office failure and I'm not surprised - pretentious and pointless in the end....Appears to have been made as an in-joke for cult-inducted Hollywood stars."
25,The Master,2,26 September 2012,Save your money,"Maybe it's just me, but I almost left in time to get my money back. My wife left early and was waiting for me in the lobby. Who could imagine casting Joaquin Phoenix as an ""angry young man"" (who now is brain-addled and a bit violent perhaps from the incredible concoctions he's been brewing and drinking). And who really wants to see what Grandma would look like full frontal nudity at a cocktail party? If you are anxious to see a slightly shorter version of ""The Incredible Lightness of Being"" with a bit sharper cinematography and snappier orchestration, then this film will be a delight for you. If, on the other hand, you fear a migraine from trying to piece together twisted plot lines, symbolic meaning, and tiresome allegories... you may want to save your money. This ordeal is a real ""mind bender"" and it hurts. I am aware of the ""raves"" a lot of critics are slathering on this piece of ""art"" and I suppose I'm just too shallow to ""get it"". I surrender!"
26,The Master,1,29 September 2012,Pointless and repellent,"If your idea of film entertainment is to spend 2 hours and 17 pointless minutes with a violent, unstable creep in the final stages of alcoholism, The Master is your ticket to fun! Joaquin Phoenix plays the creep, a wet-brained WWII vet who concocts revolting cocktails from whatever material--beer and coconuts, paint thinner, photo developer, he can lay hands on. Watching him mix his brews will cause your throat to constrict with revulsion every time. At one point in the film he falls into the sphere of cult leader Philip Seymour Hoffman, who's relationship with Phoenix' character seems to be a metaphysical form of pulling the wings off flies. It's all terribly pointless and boring. It's not often I walk out of a movie theater wanting to rush home and take a long shower to wash the film experience away. After The Master, I did."
27,The Master,3,28 April 2014,Totally pointless. Incredibly over-rated.,"I enjoyed this film for the first half hour, mainly for Phoenix's character and his performance. After that - around about the time Seymour Hoffman's character comes into play - the film became dull and utterly pointless.I can't find any reason for this film's existence and after watching it I just felt it had no meaning, no value and was completely unnecessary. It really wasn't worth wasting over 2 and a half hours on.It is a shame as I like the other PTA films I've seen - Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love, so I automatically assumed I would enjoy this too.At the time of writing this film has a score of 7.1, which makes it highly over-rated.I gave it 3 for Phoenix's performance, which I enjoyed."
28,The Master,,10 March 2013,"Looks stunning, wonderfully acted but the story-telling is weak and gradually loses any momentum it may have had","I came into The Master knowing almost nothing about it and, knowing (and caring) almost nothing about Scientology, it transpires that I may not have been able to take as much from it as someone going in fully informed and ready to be led by the director. I say this upfront because I have noticed that generally, criticism of this film tends to be met with a snobby dismissal of the individual who didn't ""get it"" because they weren't smart enough etc. This said, the film started well and it engaged me for well over the first half, building characters and exploring them in a patience rhythmic manner that mirrors the hypnotic delivery of Dodd himself. Sadly this build doesn't have a delivery to speak of and in the second half of the film it really did lose me.What else it lost was any direction and sense of momentum that it may have had up till that point. The story doesn't go anywhere and it takes its time doing it, meandering through similar ground and offering nothing to really justify the long running time. Some may chose to see this as people complaining about a lack of action etc (again, that snobby of assuming such comments must mean ""I need a car chase"") but this isn't it at all; the story-telling seems to fall way down a priority list and it is a real shame because so much else about the film is excellent.The first thing that grabs you is visually how stunning the film is  and it is a factor that remains consistent across the whole film. The colors, the framing and the size of the images are alluring and engaging. I had not heard of Malaimare before seeing his name in the credits, but his work here is terrific. On top of these images we get great use of music that is like a bedding rather than being stuck on top. It is hard to describe but it works very well, spilling under scene after scene and giving the delivery an oddly engaging feel and tone. As everyone has already said, the film is carried with some very strong performances. Phoenix is really great, with ragged edges and internals on display. Hoffman is more patient but also prone to rage when questioned and he balances this well. Adams surprised me the most as I think I didn't expect her to be as good as she was. The three of them (but mostly the lead two) make the film much better by virtue of what they do  and it is just a shame that the story-telling isn't better for them.Indeed this is true for me of everything, because the film is so well made, looks so beautiful and is a great piece of crafting that it really is such a shame to be left cold by it and to feel it meandering without any momentum or reason. It is a great film and it deserves to be seen for what it does so very well, but in no way is it a good story  and it is this aspect that really lets it down."
29,The Master,1,10 January 2013,"Horrible, really horrible!","I have read several of the reviews and wonder what film these people saw. This film was bad, just awful. I loved Boogie Nights and thought that There Will Be Blood was worthy of the acclaim received and its characters were interesting and appealing.In ""The Master"" I cannot find one appealing character, one moment of joy or even one moment of empathy for any of these characters. Nor can I find anything interesting about the plot (was there any?) or about the script. The only concession I will give is Mr. Phoenix's performance in filing out the role of a truly revolting, screwball character.If the director's point was to make the audience loathe these characters and loathe the idea of the modern day religious cult, then he succeeded beyond measure. I wanted to walk out half way through this awful, this truly bloody film experience, but I suffered through it til the vulgar end. The last scene of Freddie and the girl in bed having sex was gross. I would much prefer to watch porn, if this is what art house film has become. At least with a good porn film, there are attractive bodies to view and laugh-out loud dialogue and ridiculous plot twists that can at least provide a modicum of entertainment value. As far as the artistic value of ""The Master"" it belongs in a roadside flea market."
30,The Master,1,16 October 2013,"No story at all, most  boring movie ever.","I felt compelled to review this movie because of the unbelievable number of good reviews and the high rating of this disastrous flick. There is no story at all and it's long as hell with absolutely no purpose. Believe me all these good reviews come from a bunch of frustrated viewers that can't stand having been fooled so much, so they want other people to suffer the torture of watching this horrible movie. It's not acceptable to say there is a good cast, or even there is good acting performances if there is no story, it's not being advertised as an acting crash course or demonstration. Don't watch it, believe me you are saving two long hours of your life. You are welcome."
31,The Master,3,8 October 2012,Rudderless vessel bailed by the actors.,"It seems from all the 8-star plus raves about this movie that either I am totally missing something, or else Mr. Anderson himself has an idolizing cult following!The enjoyable parts of the movie were the actors abilities, sets, costumes etc. The minus aspects were that the movie had little in the way of organized plot structure- we were simply thrown into disconnected scenes that had little cohesion or indeed, relevance. Why are we suddenly on a salt-flat riding a motorcycle towards distant points, ""as fast as you can go?"" What did the scene, where Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman (The Master) go into the desert and dig up a wooden crate containing The Master's second book, add to the development of the story?There very well be an interesting movie in there somewhere, but to me it appeared as if the resulting mess we got was the sum of what should have been on the cutting room floor. Perhaps that is actually what happened?There is a reason why such plot devices as narration and minor character dialog scenes, where the main characters and their motives are discussed, works so well to aid plot development and audience comprehension- It works! To have a movie dominated by dialog between a semi-literate alcoholic sociopath and a nonsense-spouting demagogue does not interesting cinema make.Finally, how does any movie achieve the star rating it appears to have achieved on this site? If you add every reviewers star count then divide by the total number of reviews we get 3.7 stars. Surely this is a more accurate way of doing things?"
32,The Master,1,28 September 2012,One line from within the movie sums it up,"One of the followers of the Cause asks Freddie what he thinks of the second book. We all know Freddie hasn't read the book and has no clue what it contains. The follower (can't remember the character's name) then says he thinks it is awful. That the entire hardback book can be condensed down to 3 pages, printed on pamphlets and given to the people in the other room waiting to hear the Master.That's about it for this 137 minute waste of my life. Could have been 3 minutes and done. There was no plot to follow, I couldn't relate to any of the characters and the ending... I'm still not sure if there was one.Some observations/unanswered questions: We know Freddie is animalistic, so why such a long nude scene with all the women in the parlor? (And yes, it is through his eyes and imagination because the camera shot never moves from his position.) Is the Master fooling around with some of his followers? The wife implies this during the masturbation scene, but there is nothing to support this before or after this point.How does the Master bail out of jail if he is arrested on warrants from another state? Is there some sort of telekinesis going on when Freddie receives the phone call in the theater? What is this about? The Master says that he and Freddie launched 65 balloons during the Franco-Prussian War and all but 2 were successful. Depending on your source, 65 or 66 were actually launched and all but 7 or 8 were successful.And for all those who will say it is an artistic film and not a connected-dots type, you are so wrong. I felt no empathy whatsoever for any character. In fact, I was hoping Freddie would jump out the window and get this moving in a new direction or end the movie. Sorry to burst the bubble of the good reviews, but it had to be done. I have never written a movie review before this, so you should understand how awful this movie is considering I spent all this time writing this."
33,The Master,2,16 January 2015,"Ebert Was Right, With ""The Master"" There is VERY little Substance","Reading the piles of pretentious praise that The Master's admirers heap upon it, is actually more interesting than any content to be found in the film itself. Would be most interested to know how many of these folks are in therapy. People praising the film sometimes even seem to contradict themselves. For example, while giving the film lavish praise, the writer of the first user review states that The Master can be hard to sit through. Apparently, it may be news to that reviewer, but no truly interesting film is hard to sit through. Interesting ideas or developments make you want to sit through a film. While the empty and pretentious double talk constantly spouted by characters in The Master, I must agree, makes it one tough film to sit through. And any point the film sought to make about people falling for the pontificating of con artists, was all too obvious.I have no doubt that many (if not most) of the meanings derived from the film by its most ardent supporters, are ideas that were never a part of P.T. Anderson's intent, or ever even occurred to him.Back in 1981 Roger Ebert pointed out that he had never seen a film with the level of energy possessed by Spielberg's clever, witty, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Unfortunately, I think that Raiders played a role in largely ruining American films because too many producers took its success to mean that people merely wanted to see constant action, even without the kind of inventiveness found in Spielberg's work.(even Vincent Canby heaped praise on the creativity on display in Raiders)IMHO, a major reason that some people will overrate a film like The Master is simply because it is the antithesis of the many loud action films that take up too many of America's theater screens. Where those movies are filled with constant action, The Master could be classified as the perfect ""inaction film"" whose supporters really value its quiet way of unfolding. It's just too bad that the film's 2 main characters are totally unsympathetic, one being a phony who cons people, while the other is a violent and mentally unhinged alcoholic. And the fact that these two have little, if anything, interesting or meaningful to say, only serves to help firmly place the audience in the black hole that is The Master. If the imaginary place known as Hell actually did exist, never ending replays of this film would be a perfect punishment for the inmates. Basically, I think that people who like this film have been conned in much the same way as were the boatload of characters in the film who were subjected to the ravings of Hoffman's character.I think that for admirers of The Master, P.T. Anderson should shoot a 3 hour film about a used car salesman sitting in a hospital waiting room with a wino, and the two of them offering their observations on the progress of a group of ants that take the entire movie's running time to traverse the length of the room. I have little doubt that Mr Anderson's most devoted supporters upon being accorded the ""privilege"" of beingamong the first to view such a piece of art, would come up with raving appraisals like: ""With his latest film, Paul Thomas Anderson has raised American cinema to a new level of courageous and creative brilliance."""
34,The Master,1,26 January 2014,A slow mess with strong performances from Phoenix and Hoffman,"I had so much hope for this film. There Will Be Blood by Anderson was good but his earlier work ,Magnolia and Boogie Nights in particular, made me a big fan of his.However, after watching The Master, I was left empty and angry. This truly was 2 hours and 17 minutes I will never get back. The film was a tedious mess which even the strong lead performances cannot save.The pacing is poor, the story is non-existent and this all leads to a dead end.I kept watching, expecting the events that occur in the movie to mean something, but the ending was poor and left me regretting the fact I had watched the film.I am a big movie fan and love quite a few art house movies. This was not one I loved.Overall a poor film and one of the worst of 2013. AVOID WATCHING AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!"
35,The Master,4,4 February 2013,The greatest film about nothing of all time !,"Here it is. Step right up bods and girls. You'll never seen this kind of thing again. It's the most style with the least substance you will ever experience! There were several directions this could have gone that could have led to a compelling film. It could have been about Freddie's wanderings, PTSD, and attempts at being ""normal."" Ir could have been about the how the cult leader was a reflection of the times (through a fun house mirror, obviously). It could have been about cult dynamics. And on and on...Instead, it seemed like the film-maker was toying with the audience. The best ""spin"" I could put on this film is that it was an attempt to give the audience a sense of the times in a non-traditional way, though I don't think it did an especially good job at this endeavor in any case. For a short time, I thought this might be similar to ""The Thin Red Line,"" which I enjoyed and consider an excellent film. By contrast, ""The Master"" was a ""jack of all trades,"" which didn't make for a particularly noteworthy cinematic experience."
36,The Master,1,23 February 2013,Long and Boring,"Although the acting could be rated well, it is hard to say because there was no idea to the story line, therefore, not really sure how well was it acted really. Aside from a few discussing details there was not much more to see. I am sure that some people will give good rating just because they haven't found the real idea in the movie and didn't understand it because there was nothing to understand in the first place, but were afraid to make a mistake. So they gave it above 5 stars just to be on a safe side. I lost those two hours and I am never getting them back but you have a choice. Taking a walk would be a better use of your time for sure. There are a few nude scenes and that could be worth seeing but again, it is actually paying too much even for that small detail."
37,The Master,1,18 November 2012,I lost 137 minutes of my life! I want them back!,"So you have those ""moments"" in life and as a filmmaker-- this one was a stinger. I saw THE MASTER last night trudging thru the pouring rain---and I was SO disappointed and outraged that a film like this was EVER made in the first place. Stellar director, stellar cast---Horrendous, thin, meaningless script/story--- badly in need of DIRECTION and better yet some skillful, consistent EDITING!! UGH! It was utter labor watching this piece of DREK!! What was the point? This was a story that NEVER needed to be told. Don't get me wrong I am a huge fan of Anderson (for There Will Be Blood) and the cast. But Joaquin's performance was so over the top, predictable, FORCED and painfully self indulgent...was there anyone home at ALL in this film?? Amy Adams as PSH's wife---really?? Terrible casting on that one. I am blaming a lot of the problems on the editing.They more than likely ---with this cast--- had 800 hours of footage and when it came to editing they forgot the most important part be true to the material and TELL THE STORY! There were gaps that were so blatant that it made my brain hurt. Naked women OK where did that fit in---editing--what was his ""plan"" hand job at the bathroom sink---HOW in all that is holy did that fit in?? Where did it come from??? (no pun intended). And the slow--excruciating (though I love Ella F.) PLODDING sound track ONLY made the movie DRAG EVEN MORE!! OK how do I really feel??? I braved driving in LA, at night in the pouring rain-- a life threatening situation to say the least and I will never get those 137 minutes of my life back. I watch films like this and wonder why was this film ever MADE??? Someone forget to tell the emperor he was NAKED.."
38,The Master,3,28 January 2013,Intense bizarre well acted but bad approach,"The subject matter is fascinating - a peek into the strange world of Scientology that we all know has many celebrities as members and hands out fliers near Times Square. The cast is top notch too.Unfortunately, the approach and what is covered isn't good. A waste. Instead of having a straighforward illuminating story about a bizarre people, it chooses to go from the point of view of an alcoholic violent mumbling man played intensely by Joaquin Phoenix. This distracts from the impact of the story. The processing sessions are a bit too long but they do show us the weird mind games going on. The teachings could have been more clearly illustrated.The acting is good - Philip Seymour Hoffman is masterful and commanding. Joaquin is believable but it's hard to understand him sometimes. Amy Adams is out of her usual sweet mode as the wife of the Master. She is quite subtle and good - both devoted and supportive.Overall it was disappointing because it only showed us a rather unsatisfying look at the cult."
39,The Master,9,26 June 2013,A visceral tour de force on every single level. A mesmerising study on the human condition. Film of the year for sure.,"Five years we waited for There Will Be Blood and five years we waited for The Master. With that amount of time between films, it's hard not to expect a complicated grand epic that will cut deep into the soul like Magnolia. Hell, that only took two years. Perhaps Anderson's period dramas are grand epics on a different scale, but they are visceral examinations of the human condition rather than the hugely emotional core. Every film, bar Sydney/Hard Eight or whatever, of Anderson's make my top 100 and I fully expected it to join the rest. Magnolia is basically tied for my all-time favourite film which is enough to make him a favourite. His films have now become events that last for months before and after they've been released so it surprises me that The Master is such a simplistic film. I also expected something super serious and forgot that while Paul Thomas Anderson likes his films to have a weight and purpose, he also always incorporates his sense of humour, whether dark or juvenile.On a technical level, The Master is outstanding yet subtle. The texture of the film's colour palette feels straight from the 1950s and the composition feels even more Kubrick-esque than There Will Be Blood, with a focus on the centre of the screen and similar pacing to The Shining in particular. It's a hypnotic experience which lasts all the way to the walk out of the theatre. The sound design contributes heavily to this effect, as sudden bursts of kinetic activity are kept strangely in tone with the mundane, rather than emphasising on big dramatic moments. What surprised me most was the score, which is possibly, excluding all the songs that have been on Anderson's soundtrack, my favourite of any of his films. It constantly felt like an orchestra tuning up, which could reflect the characters and story, as they build up and rarely resolve. While the film's aesthetic is entrancing, it doesn't have the sensory overloading punch of his other films, but is certainly not minimalist.As with Daniel Day-Lewis' Plainview before, Joaquin Phoenix's Freddie Quell is a revelation. A forceful and physical transformation that's utterly electrifying to watch. He spends the film constantly contorted, hunched back with a strained expression, feeling like the broken man that his character is inside. Anderson has clearly been fascinated with these types of protagonists as Adam Sandler's Barry Egan of Punch-Drunk Love clearly belongs among them. Quell is on two modes - fight and have sex, but there's a deeply wounded and sensitive part on the inside where the kind of characters Anderson explored in Magnolia are hiding. However, my favourite performance of the film was Philip Seymour Hoffman's charismatic turn as Lancaster Dodd, where he just completely solidifies himself as my all-time favourite actor. While the narrative is incredibly primitive and simplistic making it almost underwhelming at first, it could be said that Quell represents the id, Dodd represents the ego and Dodd's wife represents the superego, rounding off the film's psychological purpose in a very incredibly profound way showing the vicious cycle of humanity. It puts humans back on base level and studies where the human condition flows to. It's all relateable in how it shows the pathways your life takes. Film of the year for sure.9/10"
40,The Master,8,7 April 2013,"A smart, visually keen, very compelling movie in the largest sense, and yet...","The Master (2012)A remarkably felt movie. If it ends up describing a kind of small, insidious, sometimes sincere cult set mostly in 1950s America, it does so by showing and leading and drawing the viewer in. That is, this is a terrific movie, a cinematic kind of tale. There is (thankfully) no voice-over, no subtitles, no factual help. And it's all perfectly clear. In its way, it summons up the period as well as the different but equally compelling ""Revolutionary Road.""Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Freddie Quell, a deeply troubled but unusually savvy ex-sailor with some unsolved sexual needs but mostly a shifting inner sense of self and of confidence. He is cocky as hell and uncomfortable, too. He is unpredictable, and he knows he's not quite stable but doesn't know how to find stability.When he stumbles onto the small ship with this strange, peaceful cult harbored and digging into their growing religious philosophy he is puzzled but also welcomed. Especially by the leader, the Master, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. (His wife, well portrayed by Amy Adams, is more skeptical, but she keeps an eye on everyone throughout the film and at times seems to actually be the true master.) Hoffman is terrific, a great match for Phoenix. They have many key scenes with just the two of them in formal or informal conversation and interview, and to watch their faces and little gestures is a lesson in great acting. And it makes for great a great movie.Almost. What brings everything down a notch or two is the the second half of the movie doesn't live up to the visceral, lyrical, intellectual highs of the first. In fact, you might even wonder if anything further happens of significance toward the end, except for the ending itself and the final conversation between the two leads. It's a subtle but steady disappointment as things continue, realizing there will be no further major turns or new characters or new ideas, just a slight swelling of what is already there. It's all so well done and the established roles and still enjoyable. The movie as a whole is satisfying, for sure. But you might easily agree that it had the beginnings of something really special, one of the rare ones that would rise and turn and continue to impress all the way through, and then again and again. But I don't think is makes it, and so what's left is a terrific, subtle impression of how a small cult might grow into a big one. The basis of this, Scientology, is pretty right on, but I think the idea of a small group of slightly misplaced, or slightly needy people (that might be most of us) finding some hope and peace and purpose with each other, is pretty common. That is grows around a personality or two like this one does is probably the step that defines what kind of cult you end up with. Are cults bad? Do they sucker their members? This movie doesn't judge. It just shows with a hint of realization how it might actually happen.Beautifully done at its best. Some rare moments here worth seeing. And the director and writer Paul Thomas Anderson (check his creds) is increasingly impressive."
41,The Master,4,29 September 2012,"Too long, no plot","I've got a 1000 word limit, but will have a hard time reaching it. I've got very little to say about this movie. I was checking my watch from the half-way mark in this interminable movie (136 minutes). I like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams, but I've seen them both in better roles. I couldn't understand half of what Joaquin Phoenix said. What was the point of this movie? For whom should I have sympathy. From whom should I learn? About what am I enlightened? Somehow, most of the critics were fooled on this one with a score of 85 on both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes. Rex Reed saw the flaws and called it ""crap."" Ebert saw the flaws, but still gave it a 2.5. AO Scott and others thought it was ""great"" movie. Define great!"
42,The Master,10,25 September 2012,Excellent performances in a profound movie,"This movie features wonderful acting in a complex story which is entirely plausible. Basically, the movie is about a disturbed drifter named Freddie, played by Jaoquin Phoenix, a veteran of combat while serving in the Navy during World War Two, who by sheer chance is brought under the guidance and protection of a charismatic charlatan named Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is promoting a pseudo-religion that purports to offer a way to cure people of their personal problems and thereby achieve happiness. The cinematography in excellent. The movie also has scenes of graphic nudity which, in this case, are relevant to the story, and which further reveal the nature of Freddie's mind. Freddie is a disturbed individual who is socially dysfunctional. His impulsiveness and anger cause him to repeatedly act out and get into trouble. He tries to deal with his behavioral issues by self-medicating through ingestion of unrefined alcohol, which is poison. During their first meeting, Dodd immediately realizes that Freddie is seriously disturbed and decides to take the ex-Navy man under his care and make him his poster boy for his new religion in order to show his followers that even a case like Freddie can be ""cured."" How Lancaster Dodd subsequently tries and repeatedly fails to ""cure"" Freddie and in the process places the credibility of his entire organization and his personal reputation at risk is what this movie is about. Dodd's wife and his other closest followers tell Dodd that Freddie cannot be cured because Freddie does not want help and is an alcoholic, but Dodd refuses to listen because if he gives up then he will have to admit that his religion is a fraud and that he is a failure and a scam artist. Finally, Dodd's failure is attributed to Freddie's unwillingness to accept help and his alcoholism and he is banished from the program; once again Freddie is adrift in a world, in worse shape than he was before he met Dodd. The chemistry between Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Hoffman is intense; both artists should be nominated for awards. The cinematography is fantastic; the 65 mm format works. The female members of the cast, particularly Laura Dern, are wonderful. Ms. Dern should be given recognition for her performance. This is a great movie which dramatizes the harm that can be done when phonies have a chance to exploit needy and troubled persons who are at risk."
43,The Master,3,30 September 2014,"Yes, I've finally had to conclude, this is a pile of rubbish. Hollywood attempting Art cinema.","It took me a long while to make up my mind about The Master. Two of the greats, opposite one-another, and a solid expose of the idiocies of Scientology (done with oblique care). Surely it's got to be good? The thing is... it's one of those situations where you ignore a fault, then ignore another fault, then another... until you realise there are just a few too many and the bump under the carpet is getting rather large.Now, just to prevent the usual burn-out, I've gone to thesaurus.com and looked up heaps of synonyms for the word 'Pretentious'. There are some really nice ones, although, of course, you have to get the context right.Quick summary: grandiose, overblown, hollow, pompous and affected, and very, very boring.Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of my favourite American actors, and so is Joachim Phoenix. They are a rare thing - a Hollywood actor who isn't just a 'star' character-slot, but an actual actor: who can act.However, in this film, Hoffman and Phoenix may as well have both been method acting. Both of them were imitating themselves - Hoffman as the smug know-it-all con-man, more or less a role he has played a dozen times, and Phoenix as the arrogant, weasley, self-destructive addict, ditto.They wander around, colliding and coming apart again, in a script that is just made up of random bits and pieces that roughly approximate L. Ron Hubbard's construction of his master-con: the cult of Scientology.But the random bits truly are random, and in some cases they are teeth-grindingly, eye-wateringly hard to endure: a song-and-dance bit with inexplicably naked women springs to mind - I don't care if it happens to be from a true anecdote (I've read 'Bare Faced Messiah', a great read, and I don't remember anything about nude song-and-dance parties, but I'm happy to be corrected), it just smacked violently of Hollywood's typically desperate ""lets use non-sequiturs, that's arty, right?"" approach.So, my conclusion: this film is a load of rubbish.In the end, The Master goes absolutely nowhere. Even though it's commendable for having these two performers in it, for being one of PSH's last films, and for sticking the boot into the rubbish-psychology cult that is Scientology... it's still really not worth wasting your time on.Two stars for the two stars, and one for dancing on L. Ron's grave.------"
44,The Master,9,17 February 2013,the face of this man is art...,the face of Joaquin Phoenix..the face of this man in this movie is art... it's like a painting... some scenes of the movie are fascinating and the actings are really good...i mean Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserves an Oscar for this role..and i always loved Philip Hoffman as an actor..this movie seeks no point and simply just like to share a mans life.. and i don't know why..but i liked it as a moving painting..it was a form of art that you are free to create and make a point out of it or just simply enjoy it... in my opinion it was a good movie and worth a watch..
45,The Master,8,22 February 2013,Phoenix from the ashes,"Calling the performances great would be an understatement and wouldn't do the movie justice. Also if you have a chance, try to watch this movie like it was intended to be seen! On a 70mm screen! If you don't know what that is, the closest comparison would be an IMAX screen. I'm pretty sure there will be some screenings of this if you have a cinema that can play those kind of movies. Anderson really went out there shooting it like this, because it has been some time since it was last used.Joaquin Phoenix might just get an Oscar for his role and Anderson might not have targeted Scientology specifically (I do believe him, when he says it's a look on all things related to sects), but his movie does hit its targets nevertheless! A great slow moving drama, that will either have you enticed or bored, depending on your viewing habits!"
46,The Master,8,22 November 2012,An acting master class.,"Let's get this straight right from the start, The Master is a highly superior cinematic experience. PTAnderson's direction of Joachim Pheonix absolutely rivals his masterful achievement with Daniel Day Lewis in There May be Blood, in fact exceeds it. He is blessed with his relationship with Phillip Seymour Hoffman and his latest cinematographer is quite simply perfect (the incredibly narrow depth of field utilised throughout and the occasional period grading makes this a visual art piece).What many hate is the plot. The plot is, to say the least, loose and as I left the cinema that bothered me. The more I dwell on this wonderful thing the less it does.I will accede to those who call this movie pretentious. I see your point but disagree. Some will loathe this though, like the 90 year old lady who left the cinema with us proclaiming ""well, that's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.""For me, it's another masterpiece in PTA's litany of masterpieces. Unquestionably he's the most consistent, and often most challenging director at work in the USA these days.Hoffman, Pheonix and the beautifully understated Amy Adams can expect Oscar nominations with Pheonix a shoe in for gold (Hoffman too I'd reckon).They say it's all about L Ron Hubbard and Scientology. I think it's bigger than that. An essay on religion as a whole and indoctrination (brainwashing) in general. Scientology and its cult is a convenient hat to hang it on but you name me a religion that doesn't brainwash and I'll buy the Scientology argument.It's a great film. Just don't worry too much about the plot and revel in the acting."
47,The Master,8,11 October 2012,Profoundly ambitious,"Here is a movie that the art-house cinema world has been anticipating for quite a while now. We've all been looking forward to seeing what Paul Thomas Anderson was capable of producing, especially after the monumental success of There Will Be Blood. The hype around his new film, The Master, was huge, what with all of the speculations about what the film was actually about and all of the supposed allusions to Scientology that Anderson has repeatedly denied. Now it's out and the rumors and speculation become discussion and interpretation.The Master tells the story about a troubled Naval veteran named Freddy Quell who returns home from war without a path to follow in his life. He spends some time going from place to place, trying to find himself, but not being able to overcome his violent tendencies and alcoholism. Things change drastically when Freddy meets Lancaster Dodd, a charismatically jolly man who has gathered a following of disciples to promote what he calls The Cause. Freddy quickly begins to embrace what Dodd has to offer him, and a relationship develops between Freddy and Dodd, and it is a relationship that will affect both of their lives forever.The Master marks Paul Thomas Anderson's return to the movie theater in five years, but it also marks the return of Joaquin Phoenix coming back from his shameless publicity stunt where he decided to abandon acting and pursue a career as a rapper. Despite all of the crazy that Phoenix went through, The Master is one hell of a return. Phoenix's performance, as well as all the others in this film, is astounding. The performances in this film are nothing short of jaw-dropping. Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of my favorite actors, is profoundly compelling as Lancaster Dodd, and the scenes between him and Phoenix display some of the finest acting known to man in this modern generation of filmmaking.The Master delivers in aspects that we would expect it to. The performances are some of the finest of these actors career's, and the look of the film is all Anderson style and nuance. Visually this film is an unreal spectacle full of some of the most compelling and beautiful cinematography that filmmaking can achieve. I was lucky enough to see it in 70mm print, which made the visual quality of the film unbelievably fantastic. It is what you would expect from Anderson, and the cinematography alone makes this film worth watching.I can assert very clear cut opinions on the acting and directing of this film. Where I'm not as sure in my belief is the story. The Master is astonishingly ambitious. There is a lot going on. Anderson's script has built an incredibly complex web of character relationships and story dynamics. The amount of things going on at one time in this film is, for lack of a better word, overwhelming. It is a powerful and moving experience to absorb all at once, but it is easy to miss some things.I'm not sure if The Master is trying to accomplish too much, or just enough. Regardless, I am incredibly excited about seeing this film again. It is a film with so much to offer and I feel there is so much profundity to take away from it. I will definitely be watching this film a multitude of times to understand it fully. For now, I'm just not entirely sure."
48,The Master,1,10 October 2012,The Monstrosity!!,"I'll keep this short and sweet( unlike this ""movie"" )First off though I will say that before watching this I was a big fan of Anderson's and am a big fan of the 3 lead actors. That aside this was the longest, gut wrenching, god awful piece of trash I've ever had the misfortune of seeing. It went NOWHERE AND WAS ABOUT NOTHING!!!! I am a huge movie fan and I can't recall hating a movie this bad in,...... Well never!! I've never seen the Twilight films but I rather sit through that trilogy than to have to suffer one more second of this pretentious filth. To put in context The Master makes The Toxic Avenger look like Citizen Kane!!"
49,The Master,2,16 August 2014,"Once again, PTA has stolen 2+ hours of my life.","Just watched this on video and I nearly turned this off several times. I finished it as I love Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams, and kept hoping it would improve. I've found all of PTA's films painfully slow, but this one falls into excruciating. Hoffman is somehow stripped of his usual skill and charisma. Adams seems to be there are nothing more than a placeholder. Phoenix is so thoroughly unlikeable as a character it reaches a new low of unlikeable. He doesn't even manage to be so unlikeable he's loved. Everyone else in the film has so few lines it seems a waste to even bother to learn their names.For those who love this film, please spare me about how I don't understand and to go back to Transformers and how I'm just not smart enough to appreciate, I have a different opinion and that makes our world a magical place."
50,The Master,4,17 October 2013,W-t-f ?,"A skillfully produced piece of...meaningless babble. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy artsy films with vague, oblique or obscure plot lines. But this thing goes nowhere and then relentlessly keeps on going nowhere until the very end where it ends up...you guessed it...nowhere or, actually, back at the beginning of nowhere. The acting and prod values earned it four out of ten stars but it would have been nice if the writers had stopped smoking whatever long enough to conceive a direction or point to the script. As it is, it's like a bunch of loosely-related scenes randomly edited to form a sort-of story line. This is one of those films which will be lauded by idiots who think if they can't understand it, it must be genius."
51,The Master,3,23 September 2012,A Waste,"I'm not a member of the Anderson cult. I thought There Will Be Blood had fatal third act problems, and The Master is far worse. Phoenix, Hoffman and Adams do fine work impersonating characters whom there is no reason to care about. Freddy Quell begins and ends as an insignificant, inarticulate, unformed lout. Dodd is just the mid-20th century Americanized version of the familiar pseudo-Eastern parlor holy man, using meditation and trance to offer serenity, perfection, transcendence and immortality to wealthy seekers in return for devotion, obedience and, not incidentally, material support. He's tricked out his spiel with scientific jargon because he's competing with the psychoanalysts, who were at the height of their prestige as wonder workers in the postwar years. While a charlatan, Dodd is not a fraud because he has the gift of believing sincerely whatever he is saying at any given moment. His wife is only a routine Lady Macbeth; Laura Linney did a much better job in half the screen time with the same character in Mystic River. Quell beats up skeptics and heretics; the more articulate Dodd just bullies them. If you have no interest in the career of L. Ron Hubbard, you have no reason to spend two and a half hours sitting through this."
52,The Master,1,20 November 2012,A huge disappointment,"I couldn't disagree more with the above review. I found this a torturous and ultimately awful film. Phillip Seymour-Hoffman delivers yet another outstanding performance as does Amy Adams. However, Phoenix, an incredible actor, I felt over-acted and it wasn't until the final scene that I felt any compassion for him. Why he was traumatised was not clearly explained, and his posturing and mumbling made much of the dialogue incomprehensible. Furthermore, the soundtrack was not only invasive but it sounded like nails being scraped down a blackboard. I was so looking forward to this film as the subject matter, the cast and director are all brilliant, so for the two hours that I uncomfortably endured the movie, hoping for something to give it credit was not delivered. What a shame. On the plus side, it gave me an insight into the period when enigmatic men were able to capture the hearts and minds of those who were attracted to The Master and his procedures."
53,The Master,10,15 April 2013,Another film showcasing why I love Paul Thomas Anderson,"This is a subjective review, but objectively I also can't see why people wouldn't consider this a great film.Joaquin Phoenix has been one of my favourite actors for awhile, and while not always in a great movie, he always gives a stellar performance. In The Master, Phoenix is recognizable, as far as you already know who he is, but yet he disappears inside Freddie Quell: the way he walks, hunched and shuffling; his rube voice spoken out of the side of his face; an explosive anger, and unpredictable rage inside a lanky, thin frame. There's just so much to enjoy about his acting in this film, and for those who disagree I just really don't understand what you're looking for in an actor; he does the job marvellously. Not to scoff at Philip Seymour Hoffman who is more often than not brilliant; here, he shows off his chops as Lancaster Dodd (along with his wife Peggy played by the sweet Amy Adams, who also turns in a subtle yet masterful performance) who is an L. Ron Hubbard-type leader of a science based religious group. Between the three of these actors, the script comes out to be fascinating. On top of the actors, you have Paul Thomas Anderson. When I think of classic Hollywood directors like John Huston (who influenced PTA greatly in this film, as well as his Treasure of the Sierra Madre did for There Will Be Blood; Anderson has said in many interviews he watched that film every night before bed while writing the script for TWBB just to have that feel about it), and more contemporary filmmakers like another favourite of mine, Martin Scorsese, I imagine that Paul Thomas Anderson will be regarded in quite the same way as they have been (and others) in years to come. The way his films have such a beautifully constructed look to them is how you remember classic films; the attention to framing shots Anderson displays in The Master is very old Hollywood to me, and not just because of the setting, it just seems to have come from a time before the new wave cinematic approach. There are a couple points where Anderson blurs the edges of reality, which has a lot of people debating, and I think the point of a great film is to keep something in the mind of the viewer long after it has finished playing; whether you simply don't know exactly what has happened and strive to understand, or you find something worth debating, a film has done its job if it lingers with you no matter in what vein. The Master is one of those films that keeps on in your mind. Personally, I watched it several times within the first week it came out. I am still captivated by the film.I recently bought the Blu-ray Special Edition of The Master, and it also comes with a tasty extra- Let There Be Light, the documentary by John Huston, which Paul Thomas Anderson stated to be a massive influence on his film. I haven't watched it yet, as I've been checking the rest of the extras out, but I'm hoping to get to it soon. All in all- amazing film, and the Blu-ray is just like watching a moving piece of art. Incredible. 10 out of 10 for me. I can see how others will disagree, but to me it is just one of the most perfect films I've seen.Edit: Finally watched the additional Huston documentary, and it was great. Very interesting to see the psychology of these men in a brief while. Also quite noticeable the influence it had on certain aspects of The Master. Special Edition is well worth buying."
54,The Master,10,9 February 2013,Freudian Trio risks leading The Master into pop-culture cliché...,"A lot has been said about The Master's imperfections and brilliance. This polarity is probably caused by different expectations among movie goers and film critics  some are more concerned about plot and dramatic structures, while others are focused on character details and development. In this drama written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood), audiences in the latter group are heavily rewarded.Experienced through naval officer Freddie Quell (Phoenix), an inter-textual of themes nested in psychology, philosophy, history and sociology combine against the backdrop of post-war America. In general; this film involves Freddie's encounters and relationship with a charlatan leader of fictitious cult ""The Cause."" Addressed only as ""Master"" by everyone for the first half of this film; we later learn that his real name is Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman). Dodd; much like Freddie, has a penchant for the open sea and captains an expensive yacht sailing adrift the eastern coast.Contrary to popular opinion, this film is not a veiled attack at (or publicity for) Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Although similarities can be drawn between fact and fiction, Scientology and ""The Cause""; Dodd's character is patterned in part on all dissembling notions (be they philosophical principles, cultural movements, belief systems, idols of worship or figures of power) that purport to hold the key that unlocks inner peace and spiritual transcendence. For common men with chaotic hearts in need of hope and harbor, such promises is the equivalent of a mighty elixir.Story begins when World War II has just ended, and the air is thick with lust and freedom. In a first slice of hint at the Great Chain of Being between angels, humans and animals (and later... manifestations of Id, Ego, Supergo in the three central characters); we learn that Freddie is uncivilized and consumed by vice. He ranks at the bottom level with carnal desires. As his personal history unfolds, two addictions are specifically emphasized  sex and booze. The conclusion that can be drawn from Freddie's past and present is the portrait of a disturbed and damaged man trapped in Sigmund Freud's second stage of psycho sexual development  unable to control sexual and biological impulses that should've been reconciled earlier in childhood.Another vice Freddie indulges himself with is an uncontrollable urge for poison. He makes moonshine with paint thinner out of every possible item: fuel torpedoes, coconuts, photo acid. This unique talent for concocting delicious booze makes him popular with the characters he meets.Such weaknesses and ineptitude at delayed gratifications are further intensified when he bonds with Dodd over moonshine, thus giving shape to a parable homoerotic subtext that permeates throughout the film. But addictive personality symbolizes a little more than just depression and false escapism. Continuing the metaphor for a mighty elixir  the moonshine is a liberating cure for Freddie, as ""The Cause"" is for Dodd.There are many narratives attempting to interpret the film title, and they are mostly concerned with who or what ""The Master"" really is. Is it Lancaster Dodd  literally referred to and revered as ""Master"" by all followers? Is it Freddie Quell  his name, onomatopoetic in its quick, amenable sound, strikingly different to the clumsy, daunted quality of ""Lan-cas-ter Dodd""? Is it Dodd's morally appropriate wife Peggy (Amy Adams)  the epitome of conscience and spiritual conduct? If so, does it mean that women are true masters of men? Or is it a salient reference to social darwinism? Perhaps a didactic reflection about the meaning of existence? Maybe even a sexual allegory about dominance and submission?Questions and analysis surround this thought-provoking film; but the essential concept is stark contrasts and similitudes between sociopathic characters Freddie and Dodd, and their aberrant quest for hidden treasures.In the last act, we watch Freddie Quell hoist a bundle of spades as he follows Dodd into the vast valleys of Arizona. Their destination is a dent in the corner of a mountain whereupon both begin to dig. Eventually; a rusty chest emerges from dry, hard sand and Freddie asks, ""What is that?"" The buried chest contains transcripts of Dodd's second book; ""The Split Sabre"", which Dodd purports, has answers that free people from past traumas, and teach them how to regain command of their lives.By the time another memorable scene surfaces, they have parted ways  it was a catalytic incident preceding their final reunion. Freddie falls asleep while watching Casper in The Deep Boo Sea (1952). We hear dialog between Casper and Billy in the moments before Freddie experiences a dreamlike vision of Dodd. In this vision; Dodd suddenly calls from England, expresses that he misses Freddie and insists that Freddie visit simply because they are both ""tied together"". As a filmic epilogue to this emotional revelation, parallels emerge between the conversation occurring in the movie Freddie is watching, the dream he is having in this sequence, and the reality of their relationship. When the sand sculpture reappears later, we obtain resonances of an earlier scene  analogous to Freddie's previous morally deviant act. Both shots are framed using the exact same space in the exact same way, but The Master allows us to register this visual association in a sublime, yet radically different way. The film's ending seems ambiguous and ordinarily, one might say that a lack of overt resolution is weak storytelling. But a shift towards de-dramatization with a familiar companion of Freddie offers a hint in revisionist bildungsroman. He may have emerged somewhat of a winner among the many voyages impelled by worthless treasure seeking.This dark and mysterious story operates on the same level as Coen Brother's No Country for Old Men. There is technical richness in The Master's cinematography; film format, musical score and lyrical motifs found within its OST. Together with tremendous performance by Joaquin Phoenix; all elements work beautifully to produce an unusual, but realistic narrative.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com"
55,The Master,8,18 November 2012,The Master shows differences between an animal and man,"""Paul Thomas Anderson continues his string of fantastic films with this one about the difference between animals and men""Paul Thomas Anderson has not made a film since 2007 (There Will Be Blood) and he finally returns with a film less about religion but about the differences between man and animal. Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) one of the many men who came back from World War II only to be completely changed by his experiences over there. After trying to adjust to normal life going though many jobs in many locations. He steals away onto a party boat where he meets Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) a man who seems to be beloved by his community. The two then develop relationship while dealing with many conflicts from Dodd's family run by his wife Peggy (Amy Adams) and Quell's past that we learn of through sessions the two share which is called processing.Anderson has made some great films over his career and with this film and his last one his films seem to focus more on the two men and how they can be different. In There Will Be Blood it focused more on the morals of men but this film focused more on these two men who should not go together but just do. Some of the best parts of the film are shared between these two men through the men because the way they are filmed and how the actors just really get into the roles just was very impressive. The first session when Quell has to give quick answers just mixes the weirdness of the questions and the look into a man like Quell who is hard to explain.Joaquin Phoenix plays Freddie Quell and his performance may be his best so far. The character is very interesting to study because he is never ever to control his issues and anger. Some of my problems with Phoneix's performance was his delivery of dialogue which at times was hard to understand because half of his mouth would be open and he would talk quiet at these times. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Lancaster Dodd and unlike Quell is a more controlled and respected man. Hoffman plays him as controlled but the character knows how to have fun when he wants to especially in scenes when the character sings. Hoffman does get some dramatic moments when the character is challenged on his theories and this gives Hoffman his real acting moments he is known for. Amy Adams plays Peggy, Dodd's wife and compared to these two leading men he does not get enough time to emote because he character is less seen then the man. The character is first introduced to us as a nice women but when we learn more about her true intentions Adams plays those scenes very well. Peggy could be described as a modern Lady MacBeth because Dodd does not seem like the type of man that can do what he does without her by his side. Adams does own the screen when he character rules Dodd.The Master may not be his best but still Anderson knows how to make a film with interesting characters. The performances by these three main actors are strong but a problem the film has is the story at times seems separated from before but at other times it just works so well that you cannot keep your eyes off the screen as every scene is presented to you.MOVIE GRADE: A- (MVP: Phillip Seymour Hoffman)"
56,The Master,2,6 March 2013,Another art-house dud that hides behind its extreme pretentiousness,"As an enormous movie fanatic who will watch just about anything I can get my hands on, there is nothing I hate more in the world of films then pretentious behaviour. Whether it be the ""movie critics"" that use big words and dissect the meaning of each shot or those that try to convince others of a film's hidden artistic meanings. I am all for a deep, intelligent, breathtaking film. The Master is none of that. It is full of over-hyped performances, a pacing that feels like it will simply never end and a purpose that does not exist no matter what the art-house crowd will try to tell you. The first hour of the movie actually had me hooked. I was at least intrigued and then it continued on and on and on in circles going absolutely nowhere. I was hoping to see an intelligent and riveting story about a charismatic man who starts a religion. Yes, I secretly wanted to see a story about L. Ron Hubbard. Not only does Hoffman's character show no charisma but every single character in the film comes across as nothing more than bizarre and pointless with no chemistry and you care very little about them. The dialogue often becomes pointlessly flowery and symbolic annoying me even more. This film, considering its half decent rating on IMDb and also in reading some of the reviews of it, reeks of that pretentiousness that I hate.I'm going to start with Amy Adams. I'm starting with her because she got a laughable, horrible Oscar nomination for this film. Now I'm not saying she was bad...she did nothing particularly wrong because she particularly did NOTHING. She is practically an extra. She does not have a single stand out line or scene in the entire film. She could have been played by Jane Doe and it would have been equally as effective and yet they give her an Oscar nomination...ridiculous. Joaquin Phoenix gives a sopping over dramatic performance of a guy who is just off the walls ADD or something. This borderlines his erratic portrayal of himself in recent years. He wasn't even remotely redeemable and watching him was almost painful. It saddens me that any award was given to him for this ridiculous performance. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a brilliant actor. He also might be the ONE redeeming performance in this movie. His character is certainly bizarre and almost as erratic as Phoenix's character but in a different, dark, subtle, twisted way. However, what I didn't see from him was the charisma that I thought this character should have. The chemistry between Phoenix and Hoffman which is supposed to be the backbone of the film is just too strange and goes nowhere.So many people on here and critics call Paul Thomas Anderson a brilliant film maker, the best of his generation. I saw less than absolutely nothing that would prove that. I don't pretend to understand the intricacies of film making and I don't know how inspirational it is that he used special film not used in twenty years and guess what? I don't care. What I do know is that Boogie Nights was a decent movie, There Will Be Blood is one of the worst films I've ever laid eyes on...it made me want to cut my own wrists and now this dud. I think I'm not a Paul Thomas Anderson fan. The gratuitous nudity, the utterly uninspirational downright boring script that made little to no sense, and the thing that probably bothered me the most was that the film went NOWHERE!! Don't tell me there was a deeper meaning...this was just stupid. For the average mainstream movie lover, I promise you will despise the 2 1/2 hours you waste on this. Skip it. I am only giving it a 2 because I thought the first hour was okay. 2/10"
57,The Master,9,13 February 2013,The Blind Leading the Insane,"This film is not just a thinly veiled reference to the inception and growth of the global phenomenon of Scientology following WWII but is also an unusually compelling and insightful indictment of all organized faiths, whether they be centuries old traditional religions or contemporary, fly by night, cult-like financial enterprises. As portrayed by Juaquin Phoenix the 3/4 mad character of Freddie Quell's valiant struggles with himself would imply that Paul Thomas Anderson suspects that no man is beyond redemption. It also more emphatically asserts that just about no one is too irrational or dangerous to be a useful follower. The Cause, as the fictional quasi religion is named, ostensibly aims to cure people of their mental troubles which all stem from traumatic experiences suffered in life going all the way back to birth and even before conception; we can even inherit them from our past lives. As ordained by it's charismatic and imposing founder, Lancaster Dodd - sublimely realized by the incomparable Philip Seymour Hoffman - followers must purge themselves of their psychological burdens through intense and increasingly absurd repetitive routines. One such routine involves touching a wall and then a window on the opposite side of the room while reciting words which might possibly be interpreted as meaningful. It's ridiculous beyond description but then again what religious rite isn't? Does Lancaster truly believe in his bizarre notions and techniques? Does it matter? What does matter is that poor damaged insane Freddie wants so badly to believe. He isn't a perfect follower by any measure, but ultimately the doubts and suspicions he harbors about The Cause and it's Master are no match for his own desperate need for acceptance and understanding and, yes, love. That's the whole sprawling, rambling, tumultuous epic story in a nutshell - how individuals choose to subsume their own self interest for the good of arbitrary and questionable institutions. It's a fairly simple question to ask but a remarkably complex, rich and vague answer that P. T. Anderson offers in the form of a gorgeously filmed, patiently paced, artfully subtle film. It's probably too subtle and vague a film for most viewers, especially the lengthy and convoluted second act when Anderson lays all the foundation bricks of his acutely reasoned thesis, but the barrage of ideas and insights that this film hurls out is a thing of beauty. The Master doesn't just politely respond to one big question, it passionately persuades us to ask ourselves a thousand more."
58,The Master,8,16 November 2012,The Master takes the stage,"Undeniably, the world these days loves a picture, which is smart in such a way that it stirs a never-ending debate about its inscrutable, mightily ambiguous meaning. More so in times when going to the cinema is strictly connected with low-class entertainment that lacks any deeper self-reflection. The Master's significance will rather easily remain a mysterious one, due to the fact that the film intentionally accumulates a huge amount of distinct themes and places them within the storyline without hinting at any apparent purpose. However, that really doesn't mean that the film is unwatchable in any way - quite the opposite. Being a thoroughly innovative and strangely mystic picture, The Master is able to move one's imagination, disturb and shock a little, and then astonish the audiences with its mind-boggling, often confusing declarations. While those contentious divagations aren't to be affiliated with any known theorems ad personam it's not hard to recognize them as somewhat ostentatious and ironical representations of authentic presumptions stated by some of the world's most-favorite cults.The Master reluctantly aspires to be a confounding, cryptic and awe-inspiring creation that's not to be taken too seriously, yet - at the same time - it brings to the table an infinite amount of complex testimonies that might manipulate the viewer just as well as The Cause beguiles the main character of the film. Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), because that's his name, is a Naval veteran with a huge emotional baggage that's been thrown on his back during the World War II. Returning back to his homeland Freddie isn't certain of the future that awaits him there. Due to a number of horrifying experiences he became violent, socially awkward and has hard time finding a permanent job. However, on one seemingly peaceful night he decides to board an unknown ship. In one of the cabins he meets a cultivated, nonchalant, charismatic, yet mysterious man ludicrously called the master. With the gentleman's insistence Freddie embarks on a most- spiritual journey into his own psyche. His perception of the mind and its capabilities changes, and so does his attitude towards the reality that surrounds him. Through a series of rough brainwash sessions - it's hard to call them in any other way - the master makes people believe. Strange enough, because nobody is a hundred percent sure what's this 'thing' that everybody believes in so hard. It's a faith or sort yes, but what's the true purpose behind the whole quasi- spiritual movement remains unanswered towards the end of the film. And surprisingly, that works really fine - without any certain revelations the whole mysticism is harder to grasp.Aside from the matters closely associated with cults and their actions, The Master discusses a considerable amount of topics and subject - some of them briefly, other more thoroughly. By looking at Freddie and what he's been through since he joined the Navy it's not difficult to observe how his behavior relates to the controversial notion of war-related traumas that haunt many soldiers around the world to these days. Overt or not - it's not important - there's a delicate homosexual subtext in the relationship between Freddie and Lancaster (thanks to the police the master's name is finally revealed). What's more, it often looks strangely one-sided. And that brings up another topic, this time connected with attachment and subservience. Freddie is the master's obedient marionette up to a point, but it's crucial to note how the relations change drastically after some time. The thin line between controlling and serving becomes blurry, as the characters and their dispositions alternate. The film successfully conveys the vibrant atmosphere of the 50's, filling it with melancholic and attractive tunes. It seems as though the cinematographer applied a bunch of corresponding filters in order to give a somehow old-fashioned feel to all the images that the movie exhibits.The list of interpretations is endless. Everyone will have a different opinion about this film. One thing that surely all the viewers can agree on is that Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman give one of the most captivating, stupendous performances of the year. Given his distorted posture and irascible behavior, Phoenix transforms himself into a man who's tired of life and it's as painful to watch as it is convincing. Seymour Hoffman, on the other hand, makes the philosophical and existential gibberish, that he tortures the audiences with, really believable and satisfying. Wandering for a moment from the substance of the movie, one should notice how the vibe presented by both of those actors creates an amazingly spellbinding aura, and that's definitely The Master's most indubitable quality."
59,The Master,1,30 September 2012,The Master? The Disaster!,"Overlong pretentious crap. Bad times are these, in which even the professional critics cannot see through the manipulative personal agendas of one of the most impressive assortment of egos in Film History: Joaquin Phoenix wants desperately an Oscar, P.T. Anderson wants desperately an Oscar, the Weinsteins want yet more Oscars for their collection. Only maybe Philip Seymour Hoffman quite doesn't care. He seems to me the only professional here.But, why all the professional critics in one voice sing the excellence of pretentiousness and void? Why, in yet another nail in its already finished coffin, is IMDb's rating absurdly high???... Of course, the answer to these enigmatic questions is: Because The Weinsteins say so!Now, to the final point of the movie: The Oscars. Highlights of the ""creators' "" (artists??) self-importance humbly directed to the kind attention of the Academy Awards board members are: -""Look how insufferably and pointlessly long can I hold up this useless, pointless shot about which no one cares!"" (Director P.T. Anderson) -""Look at my actor skills! I can stare at my actor partner's eyes without blinking all the way through this overlong shot!"". Plus: ""Look! I can top that with a lonely tear, falling form my eye at the director's required slow pace!"" (Actor Joaquin Phoenix) -""Look at that moment I wrote myself alone in which I, The Writer, plan out a scene for The Director (me, too!) in which said Director will earn the Heaven of Seventh Art by that overlong, sustained shot in which we could watch The Actor in an unblinking-eyes-tour-de-force!... (Plus the possibility of a lonely, slow tear at the end of it)"" (Writer P.T. Anderson). -""Look at my character's subtly worked out physical traits! Did you spot how almost inconspicuously I bend my back and mumble with only the left half of my mouth? Did you notice how badly I wear my ill-fitting pants?"" (Actor Joaquin Phoenix, insistently) -""Look at those purpose-built ill-fitting pants, at those purpose-built redneck-looking all-buttoned-up-to-the-collar shirts! Don't they look wonderfully bad? Am I not so-good-I-can-be-bad at my task (art)?"" (Costume Designer Mark Bridges) -""Look at all that brilliantly subdued imagery! Look at those saturated-desaturated colors! Am I not really reflecting the period, while at the same time looking post-modern?"" (DP Mihai Malaimare Jr.).So... Don't we just all deserve an Oscar??? Pleeease!!!!"
60,The Master,5,18 September 2012,"A Beautifully Shot, Well Acted, Failure.","In Paul Thomas Anderson's newest film we witness a beautifully shot, well acted, failure.The film leaves the audience unsatisfied and confused. Unsatisfied is nothing new for PTA (There Will Be Blood, Boogie Nights) but the confusion is what is most frustrating. I think back to another PTA film Magnolia, where the viewer may be confused until it all comes together in the end. The Master, however, offers no such ""ah ha"" moment. You are constantly trying to make a story out of something that just isn't there.This stems from 2 main characters the audience can't wrap their heads around. Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is unpredictable, perverted, and mentally insane. Alongside Freddie is Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) the leader of a religious cult who speaks a lot of nonsense. The audience can't relate to either character. In addition is the lack of a storyline, things just sort of happen, no building, no receding action, no nothing! That being said it will be very hard to top Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the tormented Freddie Quell. The intensity and believability he brings to the film helps lift the movie from terrible to O.K. PTA is first and foremost an artist and you can see this in many of the shots and scenes. There are some absolutely beautiful shots of the ocean, representing the freedom it provides for both characters.Some may argue that PTA's abandoning of the typical storyline is refreshing and bold. I found it to be boring and pointless. And for a two and a half hour movie, with no resolution or storyline, the audience may find themselves asking, ""What did I just watch?"" After all, the movie was made (as all movies are) to connect with audiences, and tell a story. This does neither."
61,The Master,3,8 October 2012,"Enigmatic, meandering, and rather pointless. Art for art's sake?","I'm amazed that films, such as Tree of Life and Syndecoche, NY, and now The Master, get any praise at all. The Master is slow, meandering, enigmatic, and without a story that moves toward any end point at all. Many scenes have no apparent value or meaning, contribute nothing to the advance of the story, and/or are simply unexplained. The hallmark of a good scene is whether the film can move on without the scene, and The Master has many scenes that could be cut out and left on the editing room floor without detracting at all from the overall film. Gratuitous and pointless semi-sex scenes, disjointed movement from scene to scene, and an ending that could just as well appear in the middle of the film. Excellent acting, good cinematography, and with the ""feel"" of an art movie... unfortunately, not enough to make the film anything more than an exercise in obscure ""art"" filmmaking."
62,The Master,1,12 October 2012,Wish I'd not gone!,"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie. The opening sequence showing Joaquin Phoenix in the army was enough to get me worried. It was all downhill from there. The movie would be so much better if all the scenes with this mumbling a-hole were removed. At least then it would only be about 15 minutes long. As for the so called Master - not convincing at all! More minuses for long scenes that don't go anywhere and arbitrary (perhaps mandatory in movies now?) masturbation. The story is rubbish, the directing is rubbish. If the people running Scientology were anything like this they would be working out of a storefront in in Boise. Pathetic."
63,The Master,1,22 September 2012,"Love There Will Be Blood, Hated The Master","This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my lifetime. I have seen some pretty awful movies, but this tops my list. I loved There Will Be Blood and was hoping this would be at least remotely similar. Boy was I disappointed! Everything was unclear, as far as I am concerned there was no plot. It made me wonder if the writer/director was ""making it up has he goes"". A completely pathetic excuse for a film, I am sorry my money funded its production. The only redeeming quality was that the acting was good, but I would not be surprised if the actors did not even know what it was they were acting out.I will not be going to anymore Paul Thomas Anderson films, perhaps I might rent a DVD."
64,The Master,9,29 September 2012,Phoenix and Hoffman are Masterful,"Co-dependence is at core of cult subculture that bring together the needing-to-dominate narcissist and willingly subordinate as-if personalities. But it's the poorer boundaries of a more severe and impulsive personality disturbance that ""inspires"" (or reveals) the borderline qualities of a charismatic cult ""master."" The clan of ""The Cause"" can provide some shelter from the storm, not catharsis, nor redemption. Phoenix is transformed in his execution of this role, a compelling performance that should not be missed. Hoffman remains consistent in his mastery of character that meets the high bar and intensity of Phoenix's portrayal: rich, deep, nuanced, absorbing and complex. The cinematic qualities of sight, sound and pace immerse the viewer to palpate the psychosis and provide visual context for characters that have considerable turbulence just below the surface, leaving flotsam and jetsam in their wake, making this a ""Must Go!"" for the Cine-Buff/Art Lover."
65,The Master,1,29 September 2012,Master,"I am forewarning you all that the preview and trailer are incredibly misleading and I was far more entertained by watching other people in the theater restlessly sit through this horrible movie then actually watch the movie itself. Although the actors were well chosen and showed their talent impressively, not even that could save this monotonous and stale film. There were people that left within the first hour of the film. I considered leaving but had hope that the film might thicken, however unsurprisingly it didn't. My favorite part of the film was when the credits started to roll, the lights came on and the mostly empty theater sighed with relief that it was finally over. If I could rate this film a zero, I would a million times over."
66,The Master,8,17 April 2013,"""Heartrending, incisive and epic...""","American screenwriter, producer and director Paul Thomas Anderson's sixth feature film which he wrote and co-produced, premiered In competition the at the 69th Venice Film Festival in 2012, was screened in the Special Presentations section at the 37th Toronto International Film Festival in 2012, was shot on location in Oahu, Hawaii in the United States of America and is a U.S. production which was produced by producers Joanne Sellar, Daniel Lupi and Megan Ellison. It tells the story about an American man from Lynn, Massachusetts named Freddie Quell who after having served his time in the Second World War which has scarred him for life and been brought back to a civilization he no longer knows and is alienated by encounters a persuasive man on a sailing vessel called Alethia named Lancaster Dodd, also known as The Master.Distinctly and precisely directed by American filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson, this finely paced fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the protagonist's point of view, draws a moving portrayal of a mentally afflicted war veteran who coincidentally befriends a leader of an enigmatic movement called The Cause. While notable for its naturalistic and colorful milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designers Jack Fisk and David Crank, cinematography by Romanian cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr, fine costume design by costume designer Mark Bridges and chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman, this narrative-driven, at times romantic and somewhat scientific story about the aftermath of war and the conflicted personality of a former soldier depicts a pervasive and empathic study of character and contains a timely score by English composer Jonny Greenwood.This conversational, psychological, atmospheric and humorous drama which is set in USA during the 1950s where a friendship arises between a multi-talented author, husband and father and a former seaman whom is going nowhere, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, subtle character development, various characters, the distinct and extraordinary acting performance by American actor Joaquin Phoenix and the reverent acting performances by American actor and director Philip Seymour Hoffman and American actress Amy Adams. A heartrending, incisive and epic character piece which gained, among numerous other awards, the Silver Lion for Best Director Paul Thomas Anderson and the Volpi Cup for Best Actor Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman at the 69th Venice Film Festival in 2012."
67,The Master,6,11 February 2014,Critically-Acclaimed Film with Outstanding Performances Left Me Surprisingly Cold,"This is one of those films which the critics were nearly-unanimous in offering universal praise and yet audiences seemed to be relatively dismissive. (The film didn't quite make back its money at the box office.) The performances of Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Hoffman, and the rest of the cast were outstanding, along with the dialog which seems perfectly suited to its characters. Even the sets of the late 1940's and early 1950's were superb. And there are a number of surprising moments in which you don't know where the story is headed. However, by the film's end, I felt like there was something missing, as if the filmmakers were reluctant to take a risk with the material and say something about their subject through the story. About the last half of the film, the story meanders and never finds again its pace or goal.The film is about the obsession of cult groups which try to answer life's riddles for troubled people. In this case, the group and its leader appear very loosely inspired by Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard, called ""the Cause"" whose leader is Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman). Although Hoffman plays the title role, the story is really about an ex-naval officer Freddie Quell (Phoenix) who is suffering from PTSD as a result of his involvement in World War II. After the war, he is a lost soul roaming through life with a series of misadventures, such as attacking a customer when he works for a department store as a photographer, or accidentally offering a poisonous drink to a migrant worker.At his lowest point, he wakes up on board some kind of small yacht and meets a strange man, Lancaster Dodd, who informs him he's aboard his ship at Quell's request, although our protagonist can't remember having boarded. Quell learns about Dodd at their first meeting who states ""I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist and a theoretical philosopher, but above all, I am a man, a hopelessly inquisitive man, just like you."" He also says people attack him for his ""dangerous"" ideas. Slowly, Quell learns that Dodd is head of some kind of an underground movement combining philosophy and pseudo-science and publishes books on some far-fetched ideas which probably have no scientific basis. Dodd is often referred to as simply ""Master"" by members of this group. Dodd and his group believe the way to ""heal"" troubled people is by cleansing their souls through a hypnotic process which attempts to heal injuries inflicted during past lives.Probably the most compelling part of the film is the first half, where we as the audience learn about Dodd and the Cause through the eyes of Quell. The most captivating moment is when Dodd is accused of not only illegally accepting a large donation from a philanthropist through a foundation, but practicing medicine without a license. I thought the film would focus on these accusations, but then the film leaves these indictments far behind. Afterwards, the film meanders, a bit like Quell at the beginning. The film becomes an episodic montage of interesting moments which are rather disconnected. By film's end, I didn't feel much more was revealed about Dodd and his Cause than when Quell first joined during the first third of the film.Although all the acting is right on the money including outstanding performances by Hoffman and Phoenix, and the script dialog was absolutely true the characters, the entire film was kind of dissatisfying. We as the audience are given hints of the politics of Dodd and his inner circle but often these ideas are never fully developed. Also, much screen time was devoted to many of the ""past life"" sessions conducted by Dodd, but I think at some point it became wasted screen time. After 3 or 4 sessions, I pretty much understood the idea but instead countless others are offered without giving much insight into Dodd and who he is. By film's end, ""The Master"" was more like a character study than a story. A noble effort that wasn't quite there for me."
68,The Master,9,15 May 2013,Poetic masterpiece,"Lyrical, poetic, frustrating and visionary. I loved this film, a modern masterpiece. The interplay between the two main characters was incredible to watch. The secondary characters were all incredibly well acted. It goes without saying that the main characters where outstandingly good.The film was sumptuous from start to finish, hypnotic in rhythm and content.The almost synesthetic rendering of the film reminded me of Perfume. Lots of dreamy sequences, and angry, masterful rendering of emotion.I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in serious cinema. It might not go down in history as a movie to be remembered. It is however superbly crafted, and will live in your memory for a long time to come."
69,The Master,5,4 December 2012,What the heck was this all about?,"I still don't know what The Master is about -- sure, on face value it's a 1950's set story of a drifter who becomes enraptured by a charismatic religious leader, who has shades of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, but what was this entire film about? In the film, writer/director, Paul Thomas Anderson, does not try to dissect Scientology, it's not even called Scientology in the film, but the Cause. If it was a film trying to make a case, either for or against the religion, it might have made more sense, but the religion is merely the impetus for the two primary characters, Dodd, the L. Ron Hubbard-impersonator played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and the violent and unpredictable drifter, Freddie, portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix. The performances are real strong, in particular that of Phoenix, who has an animalistic quality to his Freddie Quell that is both frightening, and pitiful, as well, the 70mm cinematography is stunning, but the film makes little sense. Here's the problem with the film, too much of it is introspective, and not enough of it is clarified for the audience to even know what is truly going on. Why does Freddie see every woman naked in one scene? Sure, some introspection is great in a film, leaving certain things up to audience interpretation, but when the entirety of the film's story is open to interpretation as to why we sat through it for nearly 2 and a 1/2 hours, that's when I lose interest.Perhaps I am not scholarly enough to understand, which is why I don't like The Master. It's a well made film that is simply there. It did nothing for me.I give The Master a 5 out of 10!"
70,The Master,1,22 September 2012,Only an Idiot Would Fail to Recognize How Stupid This Film Is,"With this review, I'm going to save you not only the price of a ticket, but also the pain of reading pretentious, affected reviews by pseudo-intellectual asshats who are going to try to argue that The Master is ""deep"" or ""meaningful"" or (God help us) ""artistic."" Here goes: This is a bovine, uninspired film without an idea to its name. It is an example of cinematic eggheadery elevated to level at which it becomes a hanging offense. It is a testament to the criminal insistence of some directors on assembling a group of terrific actors and putting them in gorgeous settings  and then handing them scripts constructed of colorless, incoherent twaddle and wasting every single moment that they spend on-screen. The Master is not allusive, evocative, allegorical, oracular, deliberately ambiguous, ""like life,"" or any of the other b.s. you may have had the misfortune to read, if you dipped into the autoerotic ramblings of film critics manqués who  trust me on this  don't understand this film either, but get off on trying to convince you, with their winsome and enigmatic smiles, that they do. They are not smart; they are minions. If ""Master"" existed in real life, they'd be the ones hand-washing his jock. The Master is unintelligible, boring, and stupid. In fact, only an idiot would refuse to recognize just how stupid it really is."
71,The Master,1,8 September 2012,The most overrated film of the year.,"The Master is the sort of film that cinema-geek audiences receive when they ultimately come to value the notion of auteurism over and above compelling or interesting filmmaking. The early reviews wrongfully praising this film came from the director's small but fervent fan-base (often from screenings where the director himself was in attendance). Plain and simple, this film is Boring (with a capital 'B' intended). It is a complete waste of time.When I say 'boring', I don't mean that this film simply lacks action. The director's emotionally insecure fan base here will no doubt try to cast the naysayers as nothing juvenile MTV-addicts who need super-hero fight sequences in order to enjoy a film. Films do not need action, to be good. But they still must be COMPELLING. And The Master is anything but that. There are plenty of films with little to no action that manage to remain compelling. I say that as one who cherishes low action or action-free films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (especially when seen on a big screen), virtually every film of Yasujiro Ozu (who never had a single frame of ""action"" in his films), Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, La Dolce Vita, The Shawshank Redemption, The Last Picture Show, Short Cuts, etc. So please spare me the false criticism that I fail to appreciate slow-paced films because they fail to satiate my desire as some sort of cinematic adrenaline junkie with ADD. The Master is completely boring because there is no compelling story arc. It is boring because there is no significant character evolution. It is boring because there are no narrative surprises. It is boring because it is perfectly clear that the director's primary motivation for making it is to continue his desperate need to prove to others that he good director like those he idolized in his youth - rather than a need to tell a good story.While Joaquin Phoenix provides at least some tension through his tightly-wound character during the first (and best) 40 minutes of the film, it never goes anywhere. By last 40 minutes, you won't even care if it did. It does not give any significant insights into the characters, the broader notion of cults or susceptible personalities, Scientology or the theme of surrogate father figures that Anderson likes to explore.When the most interesting ""action"" in the film consists of (1) Joaquin Phoenix farting; (2) Phoenix briefly imagining a group of ladies without their clothes on; (3) Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character yelling for two seconds at a challenger by calling him a pig f***er, you know you are in trouble (except for appealing to the adolescents in the audience who like one or two fart and sex scenes in a film they can disingenuously embrace as ""serious drama""). No real motivation is given as to why Phoenix's character suddenly confronts Hoffman with his doubts about his cause while in prison, then suddenly joins back up with him. It just simply seems like something that Anderson feels is necessary to artificially inject some sense of emotional tension into an otherwise flat story. No reason is given for a motorcycle race scene in the desert other than it gives Anderson an excuse to shoot a David Lean/Lawrence of Arabia-style ""small dot at the edge of the horizon"" shot with his 70mm format, thus aping another one of his idols. No reason is really understood as to why Phoenix's character sheds a tear at the end, other than the fact that Phoenix and Anderson want to create some ""acting intensity"" that unfortunately doesn't emanate from the actual scene itself. Phillip Seymour Hoffman bursts into a song near the end that is almost as silly as group song chorus at the end of ""Magnolia"" (but then - some Anderson fans claim to have actually been inspired by the singing in Magnolia).When even P.T. Anderson's fan base admits that this film will ""alienate"" many audiences, what they really mean is that they too realize that this film is a boring bomb, but that they can't bring themselves to admit it because they have too much emotionally invested in the idea of a new auteur wonder-boy in their midst. Films like L.A. Confidential and Shawshank Redemption are far better, but don't get the same respect in film-geek circles because they were only made by talented directors, not ""auteurs"". For these filmgoers, it is more important someone writes their own screenplays and has total control over their work than the notion that work be any good. If these same fan worshipers were shown this exact same film without credits and told it was the work another unknown director they had never heard of, believe me - nobody would be singing its praises. Again - the notion of auteurism has now trumped the notion of good films in terms of what a certain fan base of moviegoers value. This is perhaps somewhat understandable given the fact that Hollywood is now so heavily focused on sequels, reboots and scripts based on pop-culture properties with an already proved fan-base. But ultimately, it doesn't justify praising bad films or reading more into them than what is really there. (In this case - a hollow shell.) Yes, the cinematography in The Master is quite good - conveying a strong sense of a past time and place without being overly stylized (and will probably impress younger audiences even more since a generation is growing up having experienced digital video photography more than film). And yes, Phoenix inhabits his character well - but all to no avail with a script and story that is completely rudderless. Had it not been for Phoenix, I would have been looking at my watch more than any other film in recent memory."
72,The Master,9,16 September 2012,Horrific and aimless,"SPOILER ALERT (SMALL SPOILER) ****This film can best be summed up by a single scene in the film in which The Master unveils his second great book. A side character summarizes the book as worthless. He laments that the book should have been released as a 3 page pamphlet rather than a full length book as it has nothing to say.PT Anderson should have taken that character's advice. The Master should have been a 15 minute short. This film literally has nothing to say. There is no interesting character arc or compelling story arc whatsoever.The leads were all fantastic, but alas they had absolutely nothing to work with. It seems that PT Anderson had an idea for a film, but absolutely no idea how to tell a worthwhile story with that idea..."
73,The Master,9,13 September 2012,"Brilliantly made , superbly arranged","I would have hard time rating this movie anything under 9 out of 10. I was fortunate to view the prescreening of this movie and I can flatout confess I was captivated from the first moment till the credits rolled. I gave the writer and also the director P.Thomas Anderson the benefit of the doubts before this movie and bit the bullet to see this long but in every single minute of it brilliant found movie. Watching Anderson's movies can be easy if you are taking a place in the auditorium just to watch it without understanding them. His movies require a great sense of intellectuality and wisdom to embed the main idea in your hearts then brains. He brings the arc to his cast in every line of his movies. Master is downright a masterpiece by Anderson that takes the audience from the end of the Second World war throughout the eye of a charismatic intellectual who creates a faith based organization in an attempt to provide meaning to his life in the bout of post-traumatic stress disorder which hits every single military man in the war. His seeing all the harrowing incidents in the military but his restless attempt to provide meaning to his life is something I appreciated a lot. 65/70mm shooting also made this movie more brilliant. If you have a chance to view this movie in this format you will be dragged in the era of the post-war. I loved everything about this movie. The music's slowly penetrating itself in the scenes contributed to the premise to make it more touching. The movie deals with an interesting idea of the leader vs. the soldier, master vs. slave. It breaks down the anatomy of a relationship so you may interpret it in any way you'd like. This movie is not predictable at all so you must be on alert every time not to miss anything. It is like riding in the spin class , once you give up you are dragged down to the fatigue and regret. If you are out there to decide to watch a great movie you are looking at the comment for a good one. You'll all love it."
74,The Master,9,27 September 2012,Puzzling yet Masterful,"After seeing The Master, I'm now trying, unsuccessfully, to master what I saw. What an odd movie. Powerful, yes. Disquieting, yes. Oscar worthy, yes, especially for Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd, the compelling leader of ""The Cause,"" and for Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell, Hoffman's manic, neurotic disciple. I was unable to separate the Phoenix from the Quell. How much of Quell's portrayal was simply Phoenix's own strangeness and how much was extraordinary acting? How much of the physical mannerisms were the character's and how much were Joaquin Phoenix'sthe narrowed shoulder thrust, the arms extended to the sides with hands behind the hips, the close-ups of a face that went rapidly from menacing frown to manic grin (with unsmiling eyes)? There's a scene in a narrow jail cell when Quell, hands handcuffed behind him, goes berserk, kicking to pieces the urinal, banging his head and shoulders into the top bunk. This couldn't have been faked. I got the feeling this was an unscripted display of violence that Joaquin Phoenix did on his own. He simply had to injure himself with the violence. How much was acting and how much the inner demons of Phoenix? Aside from the publicized parallels to Scientology, this was a film about the nature of the relationship between two menfather and son, master and disciple, potential lovers. Dodd sings (very badly) to Freddie, ""I'd Like to Get You on a Slow Boat to China."" Who is really the master who is the disciple? By film's end it seemed like they had reversed roles. I may have to see this film again to try to answer some of my own questions."
75,The Master,1,22 September 2012,The Master...a Disaster,"Reviewer Clayton Davis wrote ""Anderson has never been a director that makes a film for everyone to enjoy"". Well, that may be the understatement of the year! This film was so incredibly boring that even the acting genius of Joaquin Phoenix could not save it. I would have been more entertained watching him read the dictionary! Philip Seymour Hoffman was great too, but again even his talent could not right this sinking ship. When it finally ended after two and a half merciless hours, I loudly announced ""I will never go to the movies again"". The man 2 seats back exclaimed ""I need a drink""! Theater goers were exiting the place looking like Zombies from the Walking Dead! The Master...a disaster"
76,The Master,8,30 September 2012,A beautiful crafted film just about characters & their relationship.,"After ""There will be Blood"", Paul Thomas Anderson had risen our expectations to a much higher altitude. The Master opens up with this beautiful shots, where we meet Freddie, an odd but interesting character. A seaman, who struggles to get his feet back into the society but fails till he stumbles into Lancaster Dodd a.k.a. ""The Master"", who is self proclaimed visionary philosopher. And the rest of the movie is about their relationship. The movie is 137 minutes long, in my opinion the film will be just fine by being only 110 minutes long. Story is very well paced till these last 20 minutes. Paul Thomas Anderson did a good job keep keeping us engaged from the get go. After 30 minutes I felt I was part of the film. The movie is shown from Freddie's perspective and hence we were with him. Despite being unconventional protagonist, you end up liking Freddie. The Cinematography was very good, too much use of shallow depth of field which were distracting at times, but have to say very well composed shots. Production design, costume & makeup was apt, they did pay attention to every little detail there, including the unshaven Vaginas in 1950s, a little belly fat in women, the clothing style(unlike Madmen) was very true to the era; very realistic and crude. Performances, were remarkably great. Joaquin Phoenix's hunch back approach kind of bothered me, but then I got use to it. Philip Seymour Hoffman, was impeccably wonderful. It will not be an overstatement , if I say both the lead actors will get Academy nominations. All in all, very enjoyable for me personally. Good Job PTA!"
77,The Master,1,22 September 2012,The Master completely missed the mark.,"This movie was indeed awful. Beyond awful. Had I not been sitting next to four other movie-goers, I would have walked out, and I cannot think of another movie I would have walked out of. I should have known right away when it was announced that the movie was opening nationally...usually a sign that producers are concerned about bad word-of-mouth. This movie lacked a screen-play, a theme, casting (sorry but Amy Adams would have been more believable as PST's daughter, than wife). Joaquin Phoenix slumped and mumbled through the whole movie. If that is acting, then let's start giving Oscars to the Muppets. It lacked cohesiveness, the editing was equally awful, as was the directing. If this was supposed to be an expos-e on cults, then it completely missed the mark. If it was supposed to be a loosely-based expos-e on L Ron Hubbard, then it equally missed the mark. This was an embarrassingly bad piece of cinematography that lacked storyline, character development, cohesiveness, thematic relevance, a plot, ANYTHING. I am stunned that there are reviewers who saw anything redeeming in this movie. Well, to be fair, Hoffman was superb, but it was lipstick on a pig. In a time when we need to reinforce the importance of independent thought, and the evils of religious fanaticism, this movie missed an opportunity to be relevant and thoughtful, it was a complete waste of time."
78,The Master,2,11 October 2012,Don't tell me this is an art film,"I love art movies and I love seeing them on the big screen. Lately I have problems finding more than two films a year I want to see. And when I finally find a movie which interests me - in this case- I was attracted because of the two lead actors, I get so disappointed. I was also interested in this film because I had read that it was about Ron L. Hubbard . But the film left me as mystified about the cult as the book Dianetics I tried to read many years ago. Why anybody would join any cult like this one is beyond me. I got more and more bored the longer I sat there and Joaquin Phoenix did not work his magic on me nor did Philip Seymour Hoffman. I left the theater frustrated .I get very angry if somebody tries to tell me that boring films are art films. If the purpose of an art film is to bore you and send you home frustrated, the Master is an art film. But for me art is something which makes me think and usually succeeds in moving me and makes me forget my surroundings. I did not forget one second during this movie that I was sitting in a too cold theater watching something which made not much sense and after I left the theater I immediately forgot the movie. Only today browsing IMDb I was reminded of it and I thought I should warn people planning to see it.It looks more and more like I have not only to give up watching TV but also movies. Obviously I do not fit in any target group they produce for nowadays."
79,The Master,2,14 October 2012,Waste of 137 minutes,"I gave this movie a 2 because of the outstanding art direction and period detail, which is so good there are only a handful of films that have pulled it off as authentically as is done here. Even small details such as a toothpaste tube is covered.The acting is interesting, but there is no point or interest to any of the characters. The main character, Freddie, is a pervert and a raging alcoholic, who doesn't change at all through the course of the story. He's just shy of being repulsive. I couldn't find any other characters to care much about.There's no plot to the story, no linear development. Scenes just seem to hang in the air for a second and disappear. Nothing gets tied together.The worst thing about this film are the absurd flashback sequences. We see Freddie, a broken down 35 year old alcoholic drifter, with no social skills, in a relationship with a prom queen, after the story has set him up as a creep who cavorts with prostitutes and other undesirables, That makes no sense, especially considering the fact that the girl's family seems to accept their relationship. I can't tell if it was supposed to be a deranged fantasy."
80,The Master,6,17 September 2012,Supremely Overrated,"What to say about this film....?To say the least, it was a letdown. It was a character study with no plot. Exactly 1/2 of a movie. After 30 seconds of just about every scene, I could not wait for the next scene to begin, in the hopes that it would be better (more entertaining, more thought provoking, anything!) than the current scene I was being forced to sit through. 70% of the movie is close-up face shots with the camera. I understand the need to convey 'brainwashing' when Phoenix is listening to 'the Master' but as a viewer i'd like to have some idea of the setting when I'm watching. It tends to be an important part of telling a story. At every moment of 'oh I wonder where this is going to end up,' PTA let me to a dead end. Killing the exciting parts of the story and leaving me with the drawl that was 'The Master.'I'd say the people who will enjoy this film the most would be religious cult leaders (there may be a few hundred) and the mentally insane (they won't go to the theater). If it wasn't for brilliant performances from Phoenix and PSH, I'd rate this film much lower."
81,The Master,2,5 February 2014,This director has a rare talent!,"This director has a very rare talent. Just like in There Will Be Blood, I started watching this film full of expectations. After about 15 minutes I was irritated, after about 30 minutes I was bored, then at first I did not care anymore. I wrote this review after about 1.5 hours watching the film. Obviously I was irritated again, even angry.The director for me is totally incapable of telling a compelling story. He is totally capable of turning potentially interesting characters into one-dimensional, shallow characters.Why all the awards? I don't know. Did he win Academy Awards for most pretentious director for both There Will Be Blood and this film, The Master? In my review of There Will Be Blood I wrote: ""The makers of the film gave me the feeling they were far more busy trying to create art than create a good film. The film for me was one of those products you would see in one of those obscure film houses where a small group of wannabe artists and critics convince themselves of the value of the film."". The same comment applies to The Master as well, as far as I am concerned.The director reminds me of the old joke where someone gets called pretentious. His reaction: ""Pretentious? Moi?"".I never liked Daniel Day-Lewis much. I think he is a heavily overrated actor because of his overacting and he never seems to be in line with the characters he plays. For me he is an actor who acts he is acting; all form no contents (possibly unless he is in a more traditional British costume drama; I must admit I have seen good things from him there). On the other hand I am a fan of the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman. That's why I rated The Master even lower than There Will Be Blood"". I could not stand the abuse of Seymour Hoffman's talents."
82,The Master,1,23 July 2013,"How could a great cast lead to an awful, pointless film?","I do not understand how so many wonderfully talented actors and actresses could have been hoodwinked into working on such a terrible and pointless film. There was no story, no plot, no development in the characters. I am glad that I rented this for $0.50, otherwise I would have felt cheated out of my money. Now I just feel cheated out of my time. Additionally, how could it be nominated for so many awards? I have seen much better films with totally unknown actors go unnoticed that I now put very little stock into awards.Please, save yourself some time and money and skip this film. You really aren't missing anything."
83,The Master,1,19 September 2012,awful boring dull,"It is amazing to me how viewers and film students fall in love with an auteur director like Anderson but totally lack the objective ability to crucify him when he puts out a dull, poorly written miscast piece of crap like this movie. The actor with three name PSH was given a role he could not handle--he lacks the charisma of my pet cat. He is good as a petty criminal or con men, and we get no background whatsoever of how he became a Master than phony Degrees Though Phoenix is a good actor (he has never been a great one)this role has no sophistication, he simply is a common ordinary whack job. The director gives very little information about any of the other players. Who was person at the end. My wife faded in the first 30 minutes. Also stop making excuse like I have to invest my intellect or imagination to understand the movie. The great weakness today in the films of today is the god-awful writing. This script was full of holes so deep it fell apart early. Garbage!!"
84,The Master,3,21 September 2012,"Episodic, Not Insightful, a General Waste of Time","Standing at the intersection of science fiction and religion is L. Ron Hubbard, a hack SF writer whose main claim to literary fame is as the author of the self-help book Dianetics, which he eventually glammed up into a full-blown religion, Scientology. To be up front about it, I think of all religion as a scam, but Scientology even more so than most. Its theology is heavily science-fictional, with admixtures of the irreality of Buddhism, the polytheism of Hinduism, the crackpot reincarnationism of Shirley Maclaine and Bridey Murphy, and the pyramid scheme of Amway. It has heavily cultish overtones with its veneration of founder Hubbard, its secrecy, and its D&D-like experience points that let you level up. (Best way to gain XP? Pay $$.) It mercilessly persecutes its critics and its many apostates, using litigation as an economic bludgeon rather than an instrument of justice.Its most famous member is actor Tom Cruise, who regularly voices his firm disgust with psychiatry; in this he is faithfully reflecting church doctrine. Other celebrity adherents are John Travolta, Elisabeth Moss, Jason Lee, Kirstie Alley, and Isaac Hayes (who left his role as Chef on South Park because of its disrespectful treatment of Scientology).Obviously this would have been a swell subject for a serious movie.The Master is not it.Oh, it's plenty serious, all right. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Lancaster Dodd, the Hubbard surrogate. The adorable Amy Adams plays his pregnant, less-than-adorable wife Peggy. Joaquin Phoenix is Freddie Quell, an erratic, moody, ne'er-do-well drunken asshole, a recently demobilized WW2 Navy veteran, who accidentally falls in with the bunch of swells on one of Dodd's yachting expeditions.The equivalent of Scientology is called The Cause (also the name of Dodd's book), and its principal activity is called ""processing"", the obvious analog to ""auditing"". As far as we can tell from the movie, this comprises answering rapid-fire questions about your personal life, near- hypnotic attempts at past-life regression, and rapid walking back and forth between flat surfaces in an ornate parlor while being stared at by a dozen fellow sycophants.The film lurches from one such scene to another, with no obvious progression or coherence. We learn nothing about the philosophy (or theology, if you prefer) behind The Cause, nor about how Dodd managed to attract his followers (since he's more aw-shucksy than dynamic). Mainly we get to see Quell provide everybody around him with ample reason to loathe his very existence, yet Dodd perversely keeping him as a hanger-on. This engenders a reluctant loyalty from Freddie, but he's not one to subordinate himself to anyone, let alone an authority figure, so it's a tense, unstable relationship. It is, nonetheless, about 80% of what the picture's about. Much of the rest is flashbacks of Freddie's lost (or, more properly, abandoned) young love Doris (Madisen Beaty), to no apparent purpose.Nothing much happens in the movie, and it stops rather than concluding. We end with no more insight into the characters than we began with. We know nothing about the workings of the cult or the motives of its followers. The finances would probably have been boring, but we don't see those, either.In fact, it's hard to say what writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson was trying to accomplish with this movie. It seems to me like a 2-1/4 hour waste of time."
85,The Master,8,1 October 2012,"""The Master"" is wonderful and Oscar-bound","A man must serve a master, or a higher calling, in order to have peace and purpose. That seems to be the message of Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film, anyways. And while the message doesn't seem clear until the very end, there is plenty of cinematic gold to keep your mind ticking through its more than two hours of running time. ""The Master"" tells not so much a plotted tale, rather it presents us with two men who are both struggling in one way or another with the concept of something more than themselves, something bigger than their own lives. Joaquin Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a sailor who at the end of WWII is more lost than ever, and whose taste for alcohol, even in toxic forms, grows more every day. He stumbles into Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, a man whose life is devoted to The Cause, based on a book he wrote that purports to ""awaken"" humans unto their past and future lives, thus fully unlocking their potential. For some, like the volatile Freddie, it's a welcome avenue of purpose and belonging. For others, even Dodd's own son, it reeks of cult. What makes ""The Master"" so intriguing is the real world questions it raises about greater purpose and whether or not serving a higher power is a necessity. Dodd presents himself as being fully aware and realized, yet cracks begin to show as the years wear on him and his fame grows. We ask ourselves if he can keep it up. What's ""it""? His followers start to wonder too. But who does Dodd serve? Who is his master? For Freddie Quell, his master is Dodd, and he serves him to the best of his ability, yet it's not enough for him. Freddie is a torn individual, desperate for belonging and purpose yet hell-bent on never being caged up like an animal. The mere presence of these characters is enough to fill hours of potential stories, whether the plot truly goes anywhere or not. With a film like ""The Master"", the journey is in the souls of the characters, and with us as well. It's a beautifully shot film, directed by a man who has yet to commit a cinematic foul, and acted by two men who disappear into their characters so fully we forget we're watching a movie. And isn't that the point? Here is a film that should surely earn Oscar noms for Directing, Cinematography, Art Direction, Best Actor (Phoenix), Best Supporting Actor (Hoffman), Best Supporting Actress (Amy Adams, as Dodd's frigid wife), as well as Best Picture, which it will surely win until I am convinced otherwise (Ben Affleck's ""Argo"", perhaps?). This film just ""feels"" like a winner. Not only that, but PTA might just have gotten away with presenting an (sometimes harsh) analogy to Scientology, as well as slyly suggesting that both of his lead characters are closeted gays. Talk about a loaded film.-Thomas Bond, TheFilmDiscussion"
86,The Master,4,3 October 2012,Huh?,"About two hours into this 2 hrs 20 min movie, I turned to my wife and said, ""Do you have ANY IDEA where all this is going?"" She shook her head, as did I- GREAT looking film, interesting music (tho' not nearly as good as the score for THERE WILL BE BLOOD), interesting performances (Amy Adams great, Hoffman interesting, Phoenix will have to break out of that ""looks like he oughta be on death row"" look)- The script? What script? This is TWC Oscar bait, nothing more, and nothing less- What made THERE WILL BE BLOOD so compelling was THE STORY- THIS MOVIE HAS NO STORY, just a series of inspired acting improvs- Too long, not involving, waiting for something, ANYTHING, to happen- Try again..."
87,The Master,1,1 October 2012,I want my 137 minutes back!!!!!,"After reading several critic's reviews I decided to go and see this movie with my girlfriend. I liked the cast, I liked the premise, it is filmed well, yet it is the worst movie I have seen all year. It was hard to keep my eyes open, as it was slow and borrrrrrriiiiiinnnnnngggggg. And I can take slow, I saw The American, which was slow, but truly enjoyed. The main problem is the story, which is utterly pointless. I did not care for the main protagonist, Phoenix, or the cult leader, Hoffman. They acted well, but so what. This movie did not entertain, teach, or inspire. It was just a waste of my time and money. Final note, my girlfriend liked even less."
88,The Master,1,30 September 2012,"Over Hyped, Vulgar, Confusing, Too Long, and Great Acting","This movie is about a post WWII veteran, Phoenix, with a psychological disorder and has a version of alcoholism. He makes his own hard liquor that usually contains things like paint thinner, gasoline, or whatever is lying around. Unable to hold a job and being a complete pervert he is a stowaway on a boat where he meets the leader of a cult, Hoffman, and the members of the cult including Hoffman's family. Then the movie is about their ""friendship"" and the way both of these men treat women like property instead of people and how they take advantage of them. It's a very anti-female movie.I really didn't understand most of the movie and I wanted to walk out. I went with my husband and mother-in-law, yeah talk about uncomfortable. Do yourself a favor and see something else, just about anything else will do."
89,The Master,2,23 September 2012,Dreadful Bore,"I have been a fan of previous films directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, particularly ""Magnolia"" and ""There Will Be Blood"", so it pains me to have to say what a dreadful bore ""The Master"" is. Nothing ever gels in the movie; it just lies there, expecting you to take who knows what from it. People were walking out from the show I was at in a theater that draws a sophisticated crowd, so this wasn't a reaction from people who don't ""get"" art house or independent films. I was tempted to leave myself but stuck out the film's two hours and twenty minutes running time, and believe me, I felt every minute of it. A terrible disappointment."
90,The Master,1,1 October 2012,Worst Move I've Seen in Years,"My wife and I looked forward to seeing this. The reviews were spectacular, and we enjoy story and character driven dramas as opposed to the zombie/animated/science fiction selections that seem to dominate these days.There are two major new huge theaters in our town, and we thought it was suspicious that this movie was playing in only one of them. With the glowing reviews we thought it would be playing in both theaters, and maybe even multiple screens. When we went into the theater, it was playing in the small room...one usually reserved for art-house or independent movies. Strange, we thought.... people obviously knew something we didn't.Unlike the movie itself, I'll be brief. It started out slow and went nowhere. It was boring beyond description and doesn't ever go anywhere. We almost left midway when we were struggling to stay awake, but kept thinking something was going to happen to justify the rave reviews. I see that some people go on and on about the acting and the way it was shot, and the film they used to shoot it. The acting was fine, the ""artistry"" of the filming was fine, but what does it matter if the story and dialogue are so meaningless and boring ? Our 19 year old daughter was going to see this and asked us how it was. We started to play a joke on her by telling her it was ""unforgettable"" and that she wouldn't believe this film, how it changed our lives, etc. But we couldn't do it...I can't imagine a crueler joke to play on someone than to recommend this awful movie. It really was one of the worst movies I've seen in years,and am angry that we wasted our Friday night and money on this."
91,The Master,1,15 October 2017,What a waste of time,"This movie is a deep one, the problem is that it is a deep journey to nowhere!We learn nothing from it, we don't enjoy watching it, and not even the good performances of the main actors overcome the sense that we have wasted our time watching a movie that isn't worth watching!This movie may have been done to please a group of individuals with too much money on their hands...1 out of 10, because we can't give 0. Faultless acting though."
92,The Master,4,17 January 2016,Are you free?,"Freddie (Joaquin Phoenix, playing the ""same"" character again; more on that later) meets Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a ""leader"" who is making a cult with the help of his family.""The Master"" is an interesting idea, but a misfire for Paul Thomas Anderson, who makes a dull, overlong and not very interesting movie. The ""violent"" man who is tried to be controlled by the ""educated"" man, who at the same time is seduced by the violence of the first, while everyone around them both want to control or be controlled by them is not something new under the sun. And P.T. Anderson decision to make the movie repetitive and languid doesn't help.Joaquin Phoenix can be great, but here he only has the mannerisms of a great interpretation, but no heart. His Freddie is just an empty beast, who just seems to want to become someone's henchman. Seymor Hoffman doesn't fare much better. That he is a weak character is understandable, that his Lancaster Dodd has zero charisma makes for a weird sensation, as we have to believe that someone would believe his ideas about reincarnation and recovered memories. There is always someone that will follow anything, though, as they are just trying to find a... yes, master. Maybe P.T.Anderson should have centered on the power, and not on this estrange creature who calls the attention of Dodd for none other reason that he is free in a way Dodd isn't.Interesting, but a cut of twenty minutes and a more clear focus would have been an improvement."
93,The Master,2,22 September 2012,"I do believe ostentatious, pretentious, and overwrought apply","The Master is about a visionary leader who begins his own traveling church based on the notion that our lives are fluid, that we drift from one to the other, our spirits remaining intact while our bodies change. It's a movie that reaches for the proverbial stars in terms of magnitude and meaning, but its reach far exceeds its grasp. It tries hard, but in the end it's much more trying than satisfying, with long, predictable scenes, scenery chewing, and some flat-out dullness.Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a man with a plan. He's written several (unpublished) books. Okay, one's been published, and he wins converts to his new way of thinking - this is the early 1950s - that involves looking into one's past an one's dreams to determine how to make the most of one's corporeal life. He has a couple dozen followers, including his doting wife Peggy (Amy Adams), his daughter Elizabeth (Ambyr Childers), and plenty of rich folk who love to spend money for abstract gratification.Into Dodd's life wanders a former Marine, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), who has several emotional problems. He's a boozer with anger issues and feelings of neglect. When he stows away a boat on which Dodd is performing, Freddie reluctantly becomes a follower. It's not easy to change such a distressed, broken man, but Dodd tries. And Freddie is, just like the movie on the whole, very trying. The entire movie can be summed up like this: Dodd helps Freddie. Freddie does something bad. Dodd takes Freddie back and ""helps"" him some more. Freddie does something bad. One is running away but can't stay away. One doesn't want to give up on his worst student. It's an endless cycle that is nearly unbreakable.One strong criticism I have of the film is that Dodd is supposed to be this powerful, charismatic leader. I don't think Philip Seymour Hoffman was very charismatic at all. Oh, sure, he was loud and hammy, but that's not the same thing. Heck, R. Lee Ermey's preacher in the Chevy Chase movie Fletch had actual charisma. Dodd doesn't, not really, and it constantly made me wonder why anyone was following him, let alone giving him money. There are, naturally, off-screen comparisons to the Church of Scientology, although if ever scare quotes were justified, now would be the time. Just like L. Ron Hubbard, Dodd served in the Navy in WW II and founded his belief system in the same year as Hubbard, 1952. Then there's the whole bit about there being certain rules and a reliance on obeyance, and the comparison is somewhat apt. But producers assure everyone that it's not a true comparison, nothing to see here at all.A distinct problem with the movie is that the storytelling is as humdrum as it can get. Because Hoffman's charisma is somewhat lacking, and because Phoenix's character isn't compelling (he's a jerk), there's no thrust to the plot. So when Freddie does do something destructive, we're conditioned to not only accept it but predict that Dodd will try again to ""save"" the troubled young man.It's all hocus pocus, again much like Scientology is purported to be. Hubbard wrote his story, it was said, as a work of fiction, and so here Dodd is accused of making things up as he goes along. There's little religion here, just a cult of mindless twits who would be believable only if they had been drugged, Jim Jones-style, except without the poison. Anyway, because the main characters and the plot lack any real punch, the movie suffers tremendously. The actors try their best. Phoenix is fine; Hoffman overacts a little (as if compensating for his character). Amy Adams deserves better; in some scenes, she seems to be the real brains and leader, but in others she is as meek as the smallest child. She's a very good actress, but it's tough to take a character that behaves erratically when there's no apparent reason for her to do so.Reportedly, this movie was screened by director Paul Thomas Anderson for noted Scientologist Tom Cruise, with whom the director worked on the dreadful Magnolia. Cruise disputed some parts of the movie. Anderson didn't remove those parts. I don't think removing them would have helped anything.If one were to assume that this was meant as a criticism of Scientology, then one would wonder why it seemed so shallow, focusing so much on two men and their strong wills and so little on the hierarchy of the church. To an outsider, this looks like a movie about a lunatic who either believes he knows The Way or a charlatan who knows he doesn't - and nothing more. It's a movie lacking in substance, with few turning-point scenes and merely repeated conflict.It is not a movie, I believe, that knows what it's meant to be. Any movie that struggles so hard to find its identity, however small, is doomed. It must be something. It must mean something to people. The characters must connect with each other in some way. I saw none of that in this movie. The Master is a stain of a film, a movie that should have been a powerful parallel to a purportedly dangerous cult in real life but instead slips into a sleepy, unresolved mess."
94,The Master,5,7 October 2014,You'll either 'get it' or you won't,"And sadly, I didn't.Before I wrote this, I had a look at some of the other reviews for 'The Master.' Basically, they're split between 5/5 stars and 1/5 stars. However, what made them a bit different was the fact that all those who rated it 1/5 actually appreciated that it was a pretty good film, just not THEIR sort of film.I can see the arguments for both ratings.It seems that everyone agrees that the acting in The Master is top notch. You have Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joquin Pheonix both on form, delivering one brilliant performance after the next. Secondly, it's beautifully shot. Every scene is perfectly crafted and looks amazing.Then you have people like me, who, although I agree with the above, thought it was a tad slow. Yes, some scenes were amazingly dramatic and exciting. I just wanted a slightly faster-moving story with which to tie them all together with.Those who love it say that it's a 'character piece' detailing a charismatic leader of a cult, preying on the vulnerable members of society. And they're probably right. Perhaps the gauge to measure whether you'll enjoy it or not comes down to whether you find it easy to sit through slow films. If you can, you'll probably love it. If you find it a bit of a bore, you'll probably end up thinking that, although you can see the brilliance in there somewhere, it could have been a bit faster."
95,The Master,1,12 July 2014,Nooooooo.  2 hours wasted!,"I love watching Philip Seymour Hoffman, and I made it to the end if this dreadful movie only to say what? That's it? Don't believe the 9 and 10 star reviews. I don't know what they saw to give such high ratings, but it most certainly escaped me. Overall, it falls short in so many ways. If I were asked to recap this story to someone else, I would be at a loss for words. Seriously, it is confusion at best. There seems to be a lack of clarity with regard to how the story is unfolding, as if it's up to you to draw your own conclusion as to the characters' circumstances and motivations. It moves slow as molasses and you find yourself waiting for it to engage. By the time you're about to give up and walk away, you realize you've invested almost 2 hours, and you have to see how it ends. Let me save you the time-- it ends badly. Move on and keep browsing. This reminds me of those critically acclaimed films where only the critics find the movie compelling, and the rest of us are left scratching our heads."
96,The Master,1,15 April 2014,ech! just the worst,"I was very excited about the release of the film as it showed great promise on the trailers. and of course it had Phillip Seymore Hoffman and the phoenix guy who can be good when he isn't freaking you out.well... the film is slow paced and over all boring, and the worst is, there isn't any conclusion or climax to the story. I mean NONE. It's like telling a joke without a punch line... totally pointless.I've read other reviews saying it needs multiple viewings, but they must have some vested interest, cuz why else would someone say it ""needs"" multiple viewings. Good or even great movies don't need them, you just want to.Other reviewers say that because it's on 70mm film it's a masterpiece... What?? If I filmed maggots on a carcass for 2hrs on 70mm film, does it make it a masterpiece?? To be brief, I was very excited for this film, but in the end it just didn't deliver anything worth anyones time."
97,The Master,1,5 April 2014,Worst movie of ALL TIMES,"I don't know how anyone could tolerate this movie, horribly boring with no story development ever. People who have been raving about this movie really need to be made to sit through the entire movie and not be allowed to sleep. Joaquin Phoenix may be a good actor, but, here he really does not have much to do except look bored and mouth some really average lines. Why do the critics like such movie is also something that I don't understand. When you tell the story with overtones of a religious cult, there should be either some development in terms of their philosophy or at the very least an attempt to explain their hold on normal week minded people. Here nothing of this sort is done."
98,The Master,6,11 February 2014,A Cause with little effect,"Director Paul Thomas Anderson relates his strange, story-less film a clef from the perspective of a tormented alcoholic WWII vet named Quell. The Dodd character played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman seems to have been based on L. Ron Hubbard, with Dodd's Cause movement a cinematized Scientology. A few years after his discharge and multiple job losses, Quell charms the cultic polymath Dodd aboard the latter's boat with his skill mixing cocktails of ether and paint thinner.One problem is that Joaquin Phoenix' Quell is almost all attitude. He mostly is but seldom does. The scenes featuring Quell are disconnected, flaccid vignettes. His moments of crisis too predictably crest with outbursts of violence, as if Anderson or Phoenix never felt comfortable exhibiting Quell's behavior without underlining. So Quell doesn't only show up drunk for work as a department store photographer; he has to assault a customer and tear the place up. I also wonder if Phoenix tried to ""go deep"" and then gave up, confining his interpretive energies to what turns out to be a precise imitation of Timothy Carey as Nikki Arcane in The Killing (1956). It seldom bodes well for a movie once the principal acting decays into mimicry (even of the great Timothy Carey).Hoffman's Dodd is obviously the work of an accomplished actor, but it is work of an actor careful to stay within the lines. Hoffman was under no obligation to reinterpret Milton's Satan or even to deliver an updated Rainmaker (1956) or Elmer Gantry (1960). But the Dodd of The Master could have been more than a competent painting-by-numbers. He only exists in Anderson's movie as an acting part, a role, a character in a script. He has no reality. The self-consciously intense two-scenes between Dodd and Quell during the latter's ""processing"" are as engrossing as proficient scene study in an acting class  impressive for an exercise but not enough for a motion picture.Then there is the baskingly conventional look of the film. Anderson's choices of color saturation, lighting, and editing all seem to obey some iron law that every movie made today set in the 1950's must be shot in nostalgic near-sepia with the cuts kept slow. But to Quell, a man with serious mental health problems, and to the high-octane fueled hustler Dodd, postwar America would more likely be a very fast-moving place, maybe incomprehensibly so for the disturbed Quell. In a movie set in their world the cuts would be rapid, the shot duration short, the color palate ultra-real.Anderson's low energy The Master arrived as the latest in a trio of auteurist misfires, following Terrence Malick's Tree of Life (2011) and the execrable Melancholia (2011) directed by Lars von Trier. In von Trier's movie alienation looms as a metaphorical colliding planet. In The Master Dodd claims that humanity's alienation is the work of real aliens. The idea that someone could build an international movement by positing such long-ago extraterrestrial mischief as the cause of all our woe demands a more interesting movie."
99,The Master,,5 October 2013,Lost In Its Own Convoluted Plot.,"An intricately layered character study, a fascinating take on religious cult & an intriguing portrait of teacher-disciple relationship, Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master is an acquired taste that won't appeal to every viewer out there and while it benefits from the spectacular performances & technically stunning production, the entire narrative is also marred by its convoluted plot.The Master tells the story of Freddie Quell; a sex-obsessed alcoholic & World War II veteran who's having a hard time readjusting to his former life after the end of war until he stumbles upon Lancaster Dodd; the leader of a philosophical movement who accepts him as his protégé. The two are instantly enamoured by each other & develop a special bond as time progresses.Written & directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film opens on a sublime note with some breathtaking imagery followed by excellent introduction of its characters who are instantly captivating but then around the halfway mark, it deviates from its path, heads into an unfamiliar territory, becomes increasingly complex & difficult to follow, and ends on a rather uninteresting note.While the cult preaching portion of the screenplay bears resemblance to Scientology, The Master is much more than that for it aims to capture the utter ridiculousness of every belief system out there & succeeds quite wonderfully. Yet the best thing about the script remains its richly detailed & multi-dimensional characters who unlike its plot, remain enthralling until the very end.Production design team nicely recreates the 1950s environment while costumes, make-up & hairstyling add more authenticity to it. Shot almost entirely on 65mm prints, the images are sharp to look at & incredibly detailed while its camera placement, steadicam shots & other movements are worthy of admiration. Editing provides a very relaxed pace but is clumsy on few occasions while Jonny Greenwood's score is equally incoherent.Coming to the performances, The Master features a stunning cast in Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman & Amy Adams and the trio delivers some of the best works of their career in this one. Adams does not have that much of a presence here but she does well with whatever screen time is provided to her while Hoffman is effortlessly charming in the role of Lancaster Dodd.However, it's Joaquin Phoenix who ends up stealing the show with a tour-de-force work as his portrait of the alcoholic drifter in post-war America is jaw-dropping, heartbreaking & haunting at the same time and whether it's Freddie Quell's posture, walking style, sickly appearance or enraged emotions, Phoenix manages to nail every single aspect of his character with breathtaking effectiveness.On an overall scale, The Master is an audacious piece of art-house cinema from one of the most gifted filmmakers of our time that does many things right but ultimately suffers due to its inefficient storytelling & lack of proper resolution. Destined to garner a cult following, The Master is at its best when the screen is shared by a disciple who is lost & a charming leader who claims to have all the answers. Multiple viewings advised."
100,The Master,2,10 July 2013,a let down of a film,"There Will Be Blood was a masterpiece, a truly great film. So I had big expectations for this follow up and I was let down on just about every level. The film follows Phoenix as an alcoholic war veteran who comes back from war and has no real direction, he works briefly as a photographer but his anger takes over and he can't hold a job.Being jobless he stumbles onto the boat of a con man Philip Seymour Hoffman and thus begins a relationship thats highly unusual and destructive. Hoffman is supposed to be this L. Ron Hubbard type a man who invents a religion for profit. I thought that would be the center of the film, following Hoffman as he cons people but that is all a side note. For some reason the focus of the film is not on Hoffman's character but on the highly delusional and destructive and less interesting Phoenix.Had they focused in on the intricacies of Hoffman's charismatic con man this film might have been better but the scenes never really explore him. The previews were all misdirecting in that sense, you were to think that this film was really a Hoffman vs. Phoenix showdown, a low level member of a cult (Phoenix) turning on the lead of that cult. That's not what this film is about though, Phoenix only once really attacks Hoffman over his crimes and lies and soon he forgets it.The acting in this film is good and so for that reason I gave it a 4/10 but on the level of story I would have to hand this film a 2/10 or maybe less. Considering Paul Thomas Anderson was behind this project I really expected a lot more."
101,The Master,8,15 April 2013,Proves You Can Really Like a Movie That Mostly Baffles You,"To say that Paul Thomas Anderson makes films that aren't for everyone is a major understatement. I love the guy and pretty much every movie he's made, with the exception of ""Punch Drunk Love."" ""The Master"" is the biggest WTF yet from a director whose entire resume to date consists of WTF movies. But that's not a bad thing. ""The Master"" is fascinating, even if I have no idea what I'm supposed to take away from it.I have nothing to say about the film but things that sound like they should be criticisms yet for some reason aren't. For example, there's virtually no character arc for any of the principals. Joaquin Phoenix plays a sociopath who's taken in by a cult only to reject it at the film's end. But he as a person doesn't change. He's as sociopathic at the end as he was at the beginning. Also, the film just ends, seemingly arbitrarily. It's as if Anderson just got tired of telling his story rather than letting it resolve of its own momentum. But the movie is fascinating enough that the flaws don't much matter, or at least they don't while you're in the act of watching it. It helps that the film is a beauty to look at, every shot composed with a painter's care.The biggest complaint I have about the film is not really a fault of the director once you get past his responsibility in casting it. I can't stand Joaquin Phoenix. I can acknowledge that he's a good actor, but he is physically repellent to me and I have trouble literally looking at him when he's on screen. So you can imagine how much more difficult it was for me to watch him when playing such an equally disgusting and repellent character.There's no point in applying the same ""would you or would you not recommend it"" summary when talking about ""The Master."" It's not quite like any other movie out there right now, so you're either going to like it or not based entirely on its own merits, not how much it is or isn't like other similar films.Grade: A-"
102,The Master,8,31 March 2013,Masters and Men,"The sea glistening in the sun, a not quite that young and well-worn face, expressionless, being attacked by the wind, young men lazing, playing on the beach: Paul Thomas Anderson's new film starts with strong, ambivalent, volatile images whose meaning is not quite clear. They indicate peace, hope, joy of life, but there is an eeriness to them, an ambiguousness, the sense of something not quite right. They are a little to clean, a little too bright, a little too optimistic. And rightly so: the young man we see, Freddie Quell, played by Joaquin Phoenix, just released from the military, is a broken man  aimless, lost, a slave to addiction. A lost soul which nobody wants to rescue.Nobody except one: Lancaster Dodd, an author and founder of a quasi- religious community. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays him as a charismatic, intentionally charismatic man who promises answers and turns out to be the rescuer Freddie craves. Their relationship is at the center of The Master which is not that aptly titled as this is Freddie's story, not Dodd's. Again, Andersons reveals himself as a master of portraying complex, dark, broken characters. Just watching Phoenix's face twitch, his eyes flicker, his mouth quiver, as Dodd tries to get him to open up, is a revelation. Anderson gives him time, the scene is almost unbearably long but at its end, the film's story has been told in a nutshell. Here are two men who need each other, who both need saving, Quell from his demons, Dodd from his self-love  and outside pressure as exemplified by his strong-willed and almost demonic wife (Amy Adams).Dodd, of course, is modeled after Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, a fact that has dominated public reception of the film which has been somewhat puzzled due to the film's refusal to pass judgment on the ""master"" one way or another. Neither is Dodd portrayed as a genius messiah-like figure nor is he a complete charlatan. Rather he is depicted as a man truly searching for some sort of truth who when he has found something embellishes it to make it appear to be more than it is. And he does not only do harm: up to a point his methods help Quell on his path to finding himself. There is no black and white about him and that make the film harder to digest but more fascinating, too, as a result.Unlike Anderson's last film, There Will Be Blood, The Master is not as carefully structured, the longer it goes on the more it tens to meander, held together by the atmospheric density Anderson and his director of photography, Mihai Malaimare Jr., create. And yet, it is this looseness, this apparent aimlessness that makes The Master so memorable. Its magic lies not in its rare emotional outbursts but in the way it not only portrays but in its very structure and imagery mirrors the slow waking up of a man who had come to accept that he had no place in this world. Dramatic scenes, particularly the ritualistic transformation trainings in which Dodd wants to connect his followers to a forgotten past, to their basic truth as it were, are succeeded by long passages in which nothing really happens. Slowly, almost beyond perception, there is the forming of a personality behind the tormented mask that is Phoenix' face, a mental growing up and emancipation which, as most of the film, is not dramatic in nature. There is no happy ending, it ends as openly as life tends to do. Another Paul Thomas Anderson film that isn't too far from being a masterpiece.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com"
103,The Master,8,21 March 2013,The Master is intriguing and semi-satisfying,"Freddie Quell(Joaquin Phoenix)is a mentally troubled lascivious,and an alcoholic man who is prone to bursts of anger ,sometimes resorting to violence.Life is not smooth.Then he meets Lancaster Dodd(Philip Seymour Hoffman).Dodd wins him over with his charisma and intellect.Indeed it is the first meeting between the two that gets you hooked and you realize this is not your conventional film(if you already did n't).Subsequently Freddie views Dodd as a mentor and stays with him to improve.But Dodd who is apparently talented in multiple disciplines has his own eccentric treatment methods and philosophies including unique counseling methods,understanding past life,hypnosis and the like.Is Dodd a true master?A savior perhaps?Or is he just a quack in the guise of a genius?Is Freddie being guided or misguided?These thoughts keep you preoccupied mid film.The writing and dialogues seem fresh.The conversations are stimulating and the lead actors Phoenix and Hoffman deliver such powerful performances that even a questionable plot keeps you entertained,although in a different way.Hoffman especially is so convincing that you actually root for him and hope he is a truly brilliant man.You end up thinking that if he is a con man,he is one hell of a con man.Getting back to the plot like i was saying, not your conventional movie.In fact the movie mocks cliché with a shocking opening scene followed by some equally astonishing scenes(One of them has Dodd singing in a party with nude women!).The movie carries on its tradition of surprising you by ending somewhat ambiguously with Freddie leaving Dodd and we are left to use our imagination to connect the dots.Did Freddie realize that he was better off without Dodd?Or Did he realize that Dodd was a quack?Was Dodd a real master or not?The movie ends there dangling and open to multiple interpretations(If anything you are inclined to believe that Dodd is in fact a con).If you are in the mood for the uncommon,appreciate good acting and don't mind not having a sold ending,I did say watch this movie.It has enough to keep you intrigued and entertained."
104,The Master,1,18 November 2012,Pretentious garbage - don't waste your time,"This was terrible, I don't know how I managed to sit who the whole thing. Currently has a 7.8 rating! Are you serious! About an hour in I thought it was an elaborate practical joke to see how long I'd sit through such a terrible film. I can't believe anyone thinks this is good. If you like anything about this film you need to re-evaluate your life! Who needs spoiler alert? - Nothing happens! They should have warned me when we bought our tickets that it's the worst film to reach the cinema. Phoenix and Hoffman should be ashamed of themselves. Why did they agree to be part of this! There will be blood was a million times better than this in so far that things actually happened, the characters were good and there was an actual story line. This had none of the above, nothing interesting happened, 2 characters say ""hi"" to each other then you watch them walk down a hallway for what seems like an eternity. In conclusion please do not go and see this film. You'll waste 2 and a half hours of your life, and there's better things out there to do such as running repeatedly into a brick wall until you knock yourself out."
105,The Master,3,15 October 2012,Painful,"I have to join the minority in panning this film. I found it not only painful in its pretensions but pointless, since the Joaquin Phoenix character was so over the top it is impossible to relate to him in any meaningful way. The whole pseudo-depiction of L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology seemed to me to be shallow, trite and clichéd.I liked Boogie Nights and Magnolia and felt ambivalent about There Will Be Blood. I felt no such ambivalence about this one and did something I've hardly ever done over several decades of watching films (including 20 years in Europe watching their often ponderous productions) -- I walked out.The critical praise and rave user reviews here are further evidence to me that film ""mavens"" are ready to turn film into an art form as sterile and elitist as some other art forms -- ""classical"" music, painting, ""modern"" dance. A word about Phoenix. I have admired some of his earlier work but the more recent escapades in his private life make me think he's had too much mind-bending substance, and I suspect that what some people here see as a great performance is just him being weird. There may be a real person like the Phoenix character out there, but I don't really want to spend two hours in such close contact with him, especially when much of what he mumbles is unintelligible.The production qualities are great of course and many of the actors display a lot of talent, so I don't rate this one star."
106,The Master,3,23 September 2012,Flat as Yesterday's Champagne,"As an observation on the beginnings of Scientology, 'The Master' offers some small insight. As a character study, it falls totally flat.Even that insight is shallow. Mrs. Dodd echoes Scientology's 'Fair Game' doctrine by admonishing her husband to defend 'the Cause' by attacking its' enemies but the concept is never explored (And although Freddie becomes the best enforcer she could hope for, she rejects him). When Dodd is arrested and for fraud he goes to jail, chews some scenery with Freddie and the matter is never mentioned again.When Dodd first 'processes' (i.e audits) Freddie it results in the movie's most resonant and emotionally satisfying scene. It happens early in the film and is never matched. Instead, layer after layer is peeled from these two characters only to reveal them to be the people we knew them to be from the start. No growth, no insight.And it's a shame; the performances are exquisite, as expected, and it's remarkable to see them played so fully against such a meager background. After awhile, though, without a story or a character arc even the acting becomes something akin to Mrs. Dodd's intimate encounter with her husband at the sink."
107,The Master,1,22 September 2012,I want my money back!,"I never review movies online, but I had to warn others about this one - it is simply THE WORST movie I've ever seen, (that even includes Chuck Norris movies). My wife and I are baffled - how could a film with so many great actors and actresses be SO bad?? Their performances were very good, but the ""script"" was pure crap - senseless and truly awful. Although some scenes were VERY offensive, we were willing to stick with the film to see how it was all tied together, see where it went. Well, it went NOWHERE. There was no point to this cinematic suppository (thank you MST3K). I can't understand the rave reviews this film has gotten - this was a complete waste of our date night. The best part of this movie experience was the previews for other movies. Don't waste your time, don't waste your money...in fact, don't watch it even if it is FREE. If you want to see an Anderson movie, go rent Boogie Nights. I DO want my money back."
108,The Master,3,23 September 2012,Disappointing and Pointless,"I saw this movie last night at the Moolah in St Louis (awesome theater BTW). I was really looking forward to seeing Joaquin Phoenix's latest film only to be sadly disappointed. While the actors all delivered awesome performances, the plot was completely disjointed. Overall the movie felt like a series of emotionally charged scenes that were haphazardly thrown together. I cannot remember feeling this disappointed by a film since seeing the Anthony Hopkins directed movie ""Slipstream"". The characters experienced no growth or change throughout the movie and the players all seemed to be no better or worse off at the end of the story than they were when the movie began. In I cannot see that the movie had any point at all. ""The Master"" was 137 minutes spent listening to a crazy person walk & talk in circles.The only good thing this film had to offer was the talent of the actors but even that doesn't vindicate the horrible plot and GOD awful pace of the story."
109,The Master,1,23 September 2012,"Boring, disjointed, poorly plotted and way, way too long","This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Yes, the director has made some good films. Yes, the actors are good at their craft and their performances here were fine - Phoenix in particular, although it was sometimes next to impossible to understand his mumbling, particularly so in the movie's last scene. Yes, the music was pleasant and non-intrusive. But... the movie was disjointed, thinly plotted, uninteresting, boring and way, way too long. The only movies I have seen that I would categorize this one with because of overall good job/bad job rating would be Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and Plan Nine From Outer Space. These movies, though, had two advantages that put them above The Master - they were both shorter(at least, they seemed so - The Master just wouldn't end!) and they both had a few genuinely entertaining bits. I would also point out that The Master had some totally gratuitous nudity and sex scenes which I could not help but believe were put there in order to perk up a segment of the audience and convince them that they were watching ""Art"". Folks, save your money. This movie is being hyped, IMHO, because of its potential, not because of what it delivers. Two thumbs down - only because I don't have three."
110,The Master,5,17 June 2013,What exactly was the point?,"I am not impressed. Not even slightly. I am lost as to the point of this film. One character is a pathetic alcoholic and the other is a manipulator who makes a living from lies. This is a great combination if the writer actually gets around to making something happen but in this case we just cruise along watching a whole lot of nothing. There is no plot, the characters do not develop in any meaningful sense and nothing really happens for two hours. The only thing I took from the film is that it takes a grade AAA moron with serious issues to get sucked in by such a ridiculous cult. The two main actors do a great job of portraying moron and ridiculous...it is a pity they were left to struggle with such a nothing script. Many people were upset that this film was only nominated in the acting categories at the Oscars...the acting is the only thing that saves it. Everything else is just a borefest. My apologies to the arty farty crowd who think this is a great film because they were told it was. I got nothing from it."
111,The Master,1,2 March 2013,Some of these reviews are puzzling to me.,"I read some of these reviews and have to shake my head and wonder how they could have possibly seen the same movie I did. Some reviewers are seemingly trying to intellectualize this movie into something spectacular. I thought it was terrible. It was not believable. The cult leader just sounded arrogant and dumb to me, and said absolutely nothing the entire movie that made any sense at all. To top that off watching all the other dumb sheeple treating him like a God and hanging on his every word was difficult to accept. Then we have the ramblings and incoherent behavior of a lunatic alcoholic who just became boring to watch because the character had no direction. Story was disjointed and just not interesting to me. The best acting in the world is not enough by itself to make a good movie. Acting was OK but certainly not enough to carry this mess of a movie. I come away from this not even knowing what the point was of making this movie to begin with."
112,The Master,3,14 October 2012,2 ½ hours of sheer boredom,"Watched the master last night and what a disappointment it was 2 ½ hours of sheer boredom, Hoffman was great but not mysterious enough, you could not really understand why people where drawn to him, I mean he was a nice guy that made you feel important and validated but it was not enough to make me understand why he was a guru?! Joaquin was very good but a bit too weird to a point I was looking at his face trying to understand if he is paralyzed on one side or is he over acting he looked quite bad physically in this film, I hope he was just acting as I really love Joaquin!!!!!!!! loved him in walk the lineAll in all I did not enjoy this film, too long, too wired, too out of sequence, too nonsensical, too pretentious, and saying nothing! But the filming itself and acting where artistic and lovely"
113,The Master,3,29 September 2012,Nap time,"A keep-looking-at-your-watch film.Save for two elements, the performance of Hoffman (as for Phoenix, anybody can play a drunk) and the musical score, this movie is a bore. Hoffman is brilliant, filling the screen in every scene, and totally burying his slurring acolyte. The songs are reminiscent of an era where melody and poetry characterized popular music. Irrationality has its place in cinema, but in content not format. The story drags the viewer through a never-ending series of drunken encounters. The efforts of the director is best encapsulated by the remark of one of the characters about his father's message to his cult followers : ''He is making it up as he goes along''. Indeed."
114,The Master,3,29 September 2012,Not for me,"Everyone is looking for something different in a movie. Some people are blown away by performances, while others snicker at them. Some people relate to characters that others don't. Some people see art in subtle profound breakthroughs while others are left thinking ""get to the point already!"" I am the latter. This movie is long, very long. It's slow because it never really builds momentum. I always say if I wanted to be bored i'd just stare at a wall, and this movie is like staring at a wall. When you stare at a wall you're left with thoughts about life. It's not really the movie that bothers me as much as all of the people who seem to be really impressed by it.A perverted drunk who discovered and realized nothing, an egotistical cult leader who shared nothing meaningful with anyone, and a bunch of characters along the way that didn't entertain is what I saw. I have no idea what everyone sees in this movie, aside from people who have never entertained the notion of eternal life. I can see how for a lot of people that in and of itself could be ground breaking. I could see how people could either admire or relate to the struggles of these people, but I personally didn't find it entertaining or particularly thought provoking.I'm a spiritual person, I believe in reincarnation, eternal consciousness, and the afterlife, or beforelife if you will. None of the tough questions about existence were answered in this movie. He mentions how we're trapped, and there's a battle that's a billion years in the making, yet none of the details or reasons for any of it were discussed or resolved. What a cop out. He touches on how we're not animals yet we see him act like an animal any time he's angry...was that the point? How profound. No mention of god, no mention of Adam of who he's referring to when he talks about man needing to return to his perfect original form. That Idea came from Kebbalah, and is the fundamental belief. Sure it opens our minds, but where's lesson? Overall this film was artsy fartsy, long, and in my opinion unoriginal."
115,The Master,10,20 September 2012,The Master takes a dark emotional journey of the soul,"Paul Thomas Anderson has delivered some of the more provocative film going experiences with films like Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood, but his latest may be going even further than he normally does. Even before its release The Master has been a target of the Church of Scientology due to its content, but will it deliver the unique punch his films normally deliver or will the controversy leading into it be all that will stand when the smoke clears? The Master follows a drunken drifter who aligns himself with a charismatic intellectual who has created a faith based organization, but as it grows and gains a bigger following, the drifter begins to question his belief system and The Master himself. This is one of those movies that will affect people in different ways. The story, whether it was truly meant to or not screams Scientology. This may be the closest most real look into this world we will ever see, but as with most of these organizations we will never know the truth. The story here never really gives an outright explanation as much as feds the viewer information to create their seemingly own vision. It's been awhile since we've seen much of Joaquin Phoenix, but he thrusts his persona onto screen with this return in easily his most brilliant, physical and emotional role to date. He delivers a character that is so off putting and unlikeable through the entire film you have a hard time really caring about him. While that would seem to hurt the overall film, here it seems to leave you wondering in the end what he got, if anything in the whole experience. There are really disturbing moments emotionally that are a bit hard to watch at times. He reportedly got so into character that he physically hurt himself numerous times. Hoffman's portrayal of his character is a bit more laid back, still delivers just as much powerful emotion. As he speaks you are instantly enthralled in every word he has to say whether you want to believe it or not. These are two of the most powerful performances to hit theaters in quite some time and will no doubt be taking the Oscars by storm. Amy Adams, while not always center of attention delivers her powerful nature as the glue between them all.This is an amazingly brilliant film that sports a sometimes intentional slow pace towards a dark journey of inner discovery. The film is beautifully shot that only adds to the already intense nature of the characters torment. It's rare these days for a truly great film to come along that doesn't try to use big sets or explosions to capture the audience, but here they are a welcomed change. The end of this film will leave you a bit puzzled, but invoke an emotional response nonetheless of some kind, which is exactly what a truly brilliant film should do.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey"
116,The Master,3,30 September 2012,A Masterful Failure,"This film, much like Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" (2011), will most likely be up for best picture this year. It will, and already has, critics drooling over it's deep meaning and will receive countless awards for it's originality and creativity. Let me say that just because a movie is hard to understand does not make it best picture material....or just good movie material in general. The Master, written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, is a perfect example of this. This film has no apparent plot, it's confusing and in the end it's just plain boring. No amount of excellent acting could save this film from being what it really is, mainly, a 2hr 18min spew of nothingness, complete and utter nothingness. Although it will most likely be up for best picture, avoid this film. Instead go rent ""There Will be Blood"", a film that truly shows Anderson at his best, unlike this horrible excuse for a movie."
117,The Master,1,2 February 2013,Yawn conversation for 2 hours,"Did the people giving good reviews watch the same movie I did? Not only is this boring but the only thing that kept me interested was making fun of how boring it was. The acting was also hilarious to me, trying so hard but so transparent that I just had to giggle. I guess gazing with a different than normal look is amazing acting to people anymore! I loved the part he had a tear run down his eye, I laughed so hard because it was probably from his eyes drying up from his wonderful stare and don't blink acting ability.Another thing that makes me dislike this movie is the reviews that suggest it has more meaning and yadda yadda so artistic redefining how acting is done....REALLY? I waited for 2 hours and didn't catch any of that, so thanks for jumping on the cool kids wagon and saying it's good when it's not!!! Also no this movie doesn't make you intelligent. It's very basic and easy to comprehend, spoon fed almost, so suggesting it's complex just makes you sound like you had a hard time keeping up with the slowest, most boring movie in the world."
118,The Master,4,7 October 2012,Wonderful acting in a Worst movie,"If I had to give my points to the acting it was without double thinking. Both of the characters are clear, easy, complex, surprising and outstanding in their interpretation.But when we try to understand what's the movie's message - there we fall asleep in the chair...Scrambling, confusing, bad edited and a the end we find ourselves with lots of wonderful scenes and amassing shots but without any glue to put them together and get a good movie.Conclusion: 138 minutes of nice shots and great acting to say absolutely nothing about nothing."
119,The Master,8,27 September 2012,Give Me That Old Time Religion,"This film is recommended."" Two lost souls on the highway of life, And there's no one with whom we would ruther, Say, ""Ain't it just great, ain't it just grand?"" We've got each other! ""from Damn YankeesInspired by L. Ron Hubbard and the Scientology movement, or possibly the sacred Book of Mormon itself, The Master is the type of film that impresses in its glorious filmmaking but keeps its movie-going audience emotionally detached. Like its title character, The Master remains aloof and a bit too clinical for its own good, but it is a fascinating film to behold.Written and masterfully directed by Paul Thomas Anderson ( Magnolia, There Will Be Blood, Boogie Nights ) has essentially created a film about two different men who are one and the same being. These two characters are their own worse enemy: both are men of extremes and polar opposites caught in various stages in life. But in this case, opposites attract and somehow meld into one desperate personality, devoid of any humanity. They are the end results of the road taken and not taken, examples of what is and what could have been. In his film, Anderson's well-written characters are flawed and damaged individuals, one more internally crying out for attention and receiving acclamation by a select few, the other outwardly raging for some solace and never being fully acknowledged. One is cold, remote, and calculating while the other is hot-tempered, passionate, and ill-equipped as he stumbles through life. One will take on the role as leader, the other will play the questioning disciple, a modernization of the God vs. Judas theme set against the backdrop of post-World War II America.Lost Soul No. 1: Philip Seymour Hoffman is Lancaster Dodd ( a great character name for a self-appointed prophet ), the philosopher and founder of a small cult called The Cause. An imposing figure, righteous and demonic in his obscene thirst to drink from the gauntlet of power and fame, Lancaster tends to his flock of devout followers with a minimal amount of true affection and a lot of grandiose sweet talk. His showmanship and verbal skills hide the flaws and inflated ego of a man who has to deal with his own duality and duplicity. Charlatan or saint, sham or shaman, fraud or god, Dodd is all that and more and Hoffman gives a spellbinding portrayal of this conflicted man. Lost Soul No. 2: Joaquin Phoenix plays Freddy Quell, a Navy veteran who is on the rapid road to rock bottom. Freddy drinks excessively, screws with wild abandonment, and is in self- destruct mode until he meets the aforementioned Mr. Dodd and his loving commune. Looking for salvation and refuge, he joins the cult as one of Dodd's family. Phoenix gives his incendiary character a mercurial spin. It is a fearless and unflinching job of Method acting and quite riveting to watch his no-holds-bar interpretation of a man in free-fall.Hoffman's and Phoenix's scenes together are quite frequent in this film and the main reason for seeing The Master. This is an acting tours-de-force that demands your attention, especially in their first processing session. Adding solid support to these two larger-than-life characters are a subtle and nuanced Amy Adams as Dodd's Lady MacBeth, an over-protective wife whose loyalty to her husband and The Cause evolves into a perverse obsession. Anderson has again assembled his loyal following too and his skilled craftsmen bring to his film their A-game. Sumptuously photographed by Mihai Malaimare, Jr., The Master has wonderful production design by David Crank and the great Jack Fisk ( who both did The Tree of Life and There Will Be Blood ), lovely costumes by Mark Bridges that perfectly evoke the era, and a memorable music score by Jonny Greenwood whose inventive combination of dissonance, sound effects, and 40's and 50's pop standards all diffuse throughout the film to enhance the mood and action on screen. Still, The Master wants its audience to believe in its characters and story with a blind faith of sorts, and for the most part, succeeded for me due to its powerful ensemble and its top- notch film crew. But the film carries with it a divisive effect, alienating some audience members with a script that doesn't fully envelop the emotional gravitas of the characters or their relationships to transcend to a higher state of greatness due to its pretentious conclusion which ultimately weakens the film's impact. ( The director always seem to have trouble with his third act, and alas, this occurs with his latest endeavor. ) Again, the gifted Anderson sets a lofty goal but misses the target as he has done in his other film experiences. His well-made films are showcases of the sum of its parts overriding the lesser whole. Or is that ""hole""? Something is slightly amiss in The Master, but to miss it would be a loss for any serious film-goer. GRADE: B ( Damn that unsatisfying third act! )Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com to add comments."
120,The Master,2,24 September 2012,A Waste of Time and Talent,"Please understand, I have been an avid movie goer for over 60 years and I appreciate a vast array of films. I went to see this film for a multitude of reasons...Hoffman and supporting cast, reviews that indicated a thumbs up and most of all, a story that intrigued me. Unfortunately this was not to be a happy ending for me and my wife. There were seven people in the matinée including us. A complete agreement was had when we came to the closing credits. This was a stinker. Story pitifully lacking...Characters with little if any redeeming qualities and wasting of time (2-1/2 hrs). I can't remember a worse movie. What I don't understand is how so many reviews could praise this film. There is something rotten in Denmark besides this film.Hoffman....Don't try to moonlight as a Singer. Stick to acting."
121,The Master,8,24 September 2012,Focus?,"I was expecting more. You can't get much better when it comes to actin', but the story wandered too much and didn't have a focus. I was hoping it would rival Moonrise Kingdom as the best of the year, but didn't do it for me.It felt like two movies. Phoenix didn't have any relevance to Hoffman's character and vice-versa. They did relatively little for each other and didn't understand Hoffman's affinity for Phoenix.Phoenix was over the top with his craggy persona but it grew on me. The insanity and alcoholism was crushing him. But it was one note and he had no arc. He was the same person at the end as the beginning.Hoffman's L Ron Hubbard/Scientology character was potentially more interesting, as Hubbard was clearly pathological. But Hoffman kept him at an even keel, almost normal. Very understated. A great opportunity missed.The initial inventory on the ship is what is going to put them over for nominations, though.The cinematography had such richness. Shots lingered well. There was a flavor and atmosphere.But I guess after something like There Will Be Blood, there was nowhere to go but down. Not too far down.(I counted two scenes that were in the previews but didn't appear in the film itself.)"
122,The Master,8,22 September 2012,King of His Domain,"Paul Thomas Anderson's last film was 2007's There Will Be Blood. Now, he returns with a dark, intriguing, and disturbing look at the creation of a cult. The movie is a work of fiction, but its inspiration clearly comes from L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology.Anderson's story focuses on Freddie, a WWII vet who is a shell shocked and emotionally unhinged drunk who returns to the states and leads a life of misery. He makes nearly toxic alcoholic concoctions using such ingredients as paint thinner. Eventually he meets Lancaster Dodd, a Doctor and egotistical megalomaniac that begins his own church, known as the Cause. Freddie becomes involved with their little group, mostly because Dodd likes his drinks and thinks he can save the poor bastard. Freddie has a hard time fitting in; he wants to be a part, and he is loyal to The Master and his Cause. Dodd faces continued criticisms from the outside world, being called a cult leader, and having ongoing financial difficulties.The relationship between Freddie and Dodd is fantastic to watch. Joaquin Phoenix plays the raging Freddie with an animalistic and nuanced performance that is extremely realistic. His body is ravaged by the poison he drinks daily, and his mind is dull from years of wandering. Phoenix delves into the character, and brings forth a man that is practically an ape. His psychotic outbursts and sexual obsession are constant reminders to the other members of the Cause that he is unpredictable and perhaps beyond saving. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Dodd with such passion and complexity that it becomes nearly impossible to see what the man is really all about. He is a commanding presence, who can give a heartfelt speech, be a comedian to his followers, and can snap into bursts of rage. Hoffman creates a man who is truly so bizarre and delusional that it his hard to look away. Despite his self obsession, he is easy to be drawn into.Amy Adams plays Peggy Dodd, wife of the Master. Her performance is haunting and disturbing. Although her role is mostly hinted at and only once ever explicitly shown in the movie, she is a force of a character. She takes on the role of the dutiful wife for appearances sake, but underneath there is at the very least a power struggle between her and The Master. Adams gives the role a surprising amount of depth for a character that lurks on the sidelines for most of the film.Anderson's script is a knockout. He delves deep into the emotions and psychology of his characters, bringing forth deep and psychology complicated individuals that live in a world of their own codes. The character of Dodd is very reminiscent of the titular tycoon from Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. In fact, much of the film seems to be in the same vein as Kane, with a demanding and ego driven man that serves as the centerpiece. Like Welles' film, The Master suffers in one key area; that is, it doesn't have a single truly sympathetic character. Perhaps Freddie is the one we can identify with the most, but he is so troubled and self destructive that it is hard to relate.Anderson directs the film with a cold and raw style, bringing these people with all of their troubles and ambitions and hidden, unknown desires to the forefront of the story. The parallels with Scientology are certainly prevalent and important to the film, but the real interesting stuff is the relationship between Freddie and Dodd and his wife.A film that is bizarre, disturbing, and thought provoking, The Master is a great piece of art. The film is most certainly not for everyone, and many people may be frustrated by the lack of handouts the movie gives to the audience. Instead, Anderson invites us to watch Dodd and his methods of bringing people to their ""true"" selves, and make our own decisions about what was really going on.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"
123,The Master,,13 September 2012,The Master (2012) review,"Film makers for the most part make the best films of their career at the beginning of their career. They are full of youth and passion, love and hate, revolution and in essence they simply have more intriguing stories to tell. Its very few and far between that a filmmaker actually makes their best films later in their careers. Now I'm not saying that Paul Thomas Anderson is at the end of his career (hell some could argue this is just the beginning) thats the last thing we need. PTA is one of the finest filmmakers of all time; but 19 years into his career he makes the seminal masterpiece ""There Will Be Blood"". There Will Be Blood can be argued as the greatest American made film since Pulp Fiction, and one of the greatest pieces of cinema of all time. So to come off a film of the magnitude of There Will Be Blood; PTA had to try something ballsy. Now thats a hell of a statement be it he is not a filmmaker that takes an easy route. Every film he has made has been taking a risk and every single one of them are regarded as classics and some of the best modern if not all time greatest cinema. Paul decided to tackle a subject in the same vain as Scientology, with two of the finest actors working in cinema today. The Master at first glance though is a stunning 65mm cinematic masterpiece that would make the likes of Jack Cardiff, Sergei Urusevsky, Sven Nykvist, Karl Struss and yes even Paul's old time DOP Robert Elswit blush with envy. Paul has rid Robert of his DOP duties this time around to see if he can make a film without the man who helped him make every single frame of his work; and not only do that but go even further by taking a huge risk on 70mm film and a relative newcomer that Francis Coppola helped bring to America, Mihai Malaimare Jr. Mihai simply shines here. The complexities of his simplicity is something to truly behold. This like TWBB is its respective years best cinematography picture and the Academy need to recognize it as such. From little rooms to the vast beauty of the outdoor shots, you can't take your eyes off the screen. If you do however get pulled away from the beauty of Mihai's cinematography; Johnny Greenwood's score is nothing short of brilliant either. With deep influence from the masters of score Greenwood has put together a haunting and bone chilling score of such pin-point accuracy to the images; this could be watched with nothing more than score and images and be held as the best picture of the year. With the accompaniment of vocalists this time around, Greenwood has made a score of equal brilliance to TWBB and this fresh and vibrant yet haunting score will most certainly become something that young composers look to in the future of the art form. But now we get down to the nitty gritty of what i'm sure will be discussed about this film for as long as people are discussing film. This is a best picture winning film. It is so technically great that I don't think you can over look it sheer brilliance come awards time. It's the film that is so good that it can't win Venice (Please look this up if you don't already know). But where The Master is going to lose most of its audience is its sporadic way of telling a story that frankly isn't that much of a story. This is more of an experience, with a traditional 3 point structure thrown out the window. And this makes the film something that needs to be cherished. The characters are not relatable and it's more on a path of a dream than an audience friendly film. If you are not an intelligent person, or you don't like intelligent films this is absolutely not the film for you. Its a structure that would make Terrence Malick blush. But this film achieves such greatness with that style that I hope audiences finally start to become more intelligent and cherish films like this. The acting; well what can I say. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives the performance of his career and so does Phoenix. And when they are on screen together especially 3 key moments this is acting at it finest, hell its filmmaking at it's finest! I'm honestly still speechless from the film and can't bieleve I got this much of a review out. This is a life changing film, and something that will be held un certain regard for as long as we talk about cinema. The film has one hell of an ending and As I would like to end this off like that, I just don't think i'm that good. I'm sure a better review will come from me when I have digested the film and seen it at least 12 more times. This is a tour de force and Tarantino has his work cut out for him with Django to try and beat this."
124,The Master,2,17 November 2012,Worst movie of the year by a mile....,"OK, that's a slight exaggeration, this is the third worst movie of 2012. Cosmopolis and Two Years at Sea were worse.A man is going mad, he drinks a lot and tries to have sex with everything from Sandcastles to Woman who are way out of his league.He meets a man who is meant to be a master of a cult called the Cause. Nothing actually happens to suggest this man is a master of the cult. He hosts a few parties and sings rather annoying songs.The storyline is so weak that most of the clever one liners completely pass you by as you're trying to either stay awake or probably in some cases walk out of the cinema. Which I have never done but was very close.It's one of those films where you're not bothered if a bomb went off and everyone died.There's no denying Paul Thomas Andersons previous work was class, in particular Magonia. But this is just appallingly bad.Stay away unless you believe what the critics say. Who can and are usually wrong"
125,The Master,1,13 October 2013,The Master is Minor League 0*,"Despite 3 towering Oscar nominated performances, this was one of the worst pictures I've seen in years.Joaquin Phoenix returns from World War 11 a visibly emotionally unbalanced man who falls into a cult led by Philip Seymour Hoffman who claims he does just about everything.There is mass confusion in this film. Is the Phoenix character being duped by the group for its own gain? Amy Adams has an intense dislike for Phoenix and works to undermine him from her husband, the Hoffman character.A very poor imitation of an Elmer Gantry-like character as depicted by Hoffman.You are constantly left with the idea of what exactly is going on here? Terrible picture."
126,The Master,1,23 September 2012,A terrible film on all levels,"This film was a complete waste of time. Six of us went with great expectations based on the previews and hype. We are all avid film buffs. None of us understood this movie. None of us cared about any of the characters -- neither liked nor hated them. The plot was a confused mass of nothingness. The dialog went nowhere. The acting was actually terrible -- more like character acting for S. H-P., J.P. and A.A. -- the stars of this film. There was no development, evolution, or maturation of the characters. It's an indulgent film on the order of To Rome With Love, but The Master is worse -- boring and contained nothing memorable except how truly bad a film can be. Nothing heavy, nothing funny, nothing engaging or interesting. If I could give this movie a rating of less than 1.0, I would. Long and painful to sit through. What a shame."
127,The Master,1,4 March 2013,Anderson :  Making it up as he goes along.,"This isn't really a movie about religion or even Scientology, and in spite of its title it has relatively little to do with the leader of a cult. It's about a severely ill alcoholic who is brain damaged from drinking gasoline and paint thinner. He is permanently out of control with a sort of chronic steroid rage expressed in violence and deviant sexual urges. He needs a good physician, recovery from alcoholism and hormone therapy. This could have been a good movie if we had seen the origins of a cult or followed the ideas and motivations of its leader. From another angle, we may have been able to learn something about the nature of the sort of person who joins a cult if we had followed an ordinary person into the sect. Instead we have a cult leader who seemed to have sprung from nowhere and Freddy is far too frightening and deranged to be typical of anyone.Many people see this as an expose' of religion but that's like reading bad poetry and calling it an expose' of music. The Cause is not a religion. Neither is Scientology. Religions seek a higher, spiritual plane, and whether it's Allah or the Great White Spirit, they all have a supernatural God. This is the story of an ignorant, violent young man and the con artist he falls for. Neither are interesting.I had looked forward to this movie, hoping it would answer questions about the nature of cults and their members. All it did was raise questions about modern film fans and their slavish devotion to certain directors who have convinced them that lack of narrative equals artistic freedom, ugliness equals realism and criminal, deviant behavior equals the true nature of man."
128,The Master,2,29 June 2017,An utterly hollow film pretending to be profound,"An exploration of the duality of man? A story of man's animal nature vs. his higher instincts? An expose on cons and cults? A treatise on how ""every man has a master""? A story of how sexual roles and desires control us?Absolute nonsense. But the gullible sophomoric film geeks will easily be fooled by all the surface thematic tropes here. They are incapable of distinguishing between true substance and its mere simulation put on by imitative, film student strivers. Ultimately, Paul Thomas Anderson has absolutely nothing substantive to say other than the fact that he wants to be thought of as a great director who is in complete control of his work. So to that end, he conjures up surface themes and dramatic conflicts that he thinks will best help him cement this reputation, but without having anything of real substance to say about them based on life experiences. That is ultimately the problem of the entire video-store/film student generation - the fact that they have spent so much time watching movies that they have nothing to say about life outside of the framework of past films they have seen that were made by other true pioneers who came before them. Think of it this way: Imagine someone who has traveled the world and experienced wars and romantic relationships across an entire continents and then decides to impart the wisdom of the experience by harnessing artistic talent and writing a great novel from it (i.e., Hemingway or several other great authors whose experience informed their art). Now contrast this with the average college sophomore who is in love with the idea of being a writer. Perhaps he or she is inspired by Hemingway or other greats, and thus falls in love with the idea of being a similarly great writer. But the problem is that this person has nothing substantive to write about, has no similar experiences to impart, and subconsciously knows that simply wanting to be a writer isn't a compelling enough motivation to produce substantive work. As a result, this college sophomore decides to backpack through Europe in the hopes of getting into adventures and gaining interesting insights to ultimately write about and produce a book. He or she will then borrow the surface tropes of falling in love or experiencing conflict for the sake of wanting to write about something ""important"" or ""substantive"". But we all know this type of ""writer"", and how their artificially induced experiences never make for great literature because their motivations still come back to wanting to be a great writer as an end in itself. Thus the surface-level ""substance"" ultimately comes across as hollow and pointless, and the author may even crib the same styling as the previous literary greats in order to make up for the lack of substance. This scenario pretty much sums up Anderson's career - and he has cultivated a rabid following because there are countless of film school students who have the same dream and think that if he can succeed, then maybe there is hope for them too. They too value the dream of being a filmmaker with full creative control as an end in and of itself - even if they have nothing interesting or substantive to say. But to make up for this hollowness, they will borrow important surface themes such as the pain that abusive families can cause, or how love can conquer all, or how greed can prevent meaningful human relationships. It's all surface-level fortune cookie philosophizing used in the service of wanting to make ""important"" films without having anything of real import to say about it. The sustainability of a ""filmmaking auteur"" among the post-video store generation of film-lovers has become more important than the creation of new, great works that have something truly substantive to say about the times we live in. If a truly great work comes about through a collaborative effort, it is less valuable in their eyes than a regurgitated mess of a film created by a fellow film-lover with complete creative control. Contrary to what its apologists say, even the acting in The Master is bad. But then such apologists always mistake any over-the-top, emotional screeching for great acting. (""Wow! Phoenix repeated those same lines all differently, just like the acting that goes on in college improv classes! He even slapped himself! Talk about great!"" Too bad it has nothing to do with any character development or behavior that even remotely seems truthful.)The scene where Hoffman serenades Phoenix with a ""slow boat to China"" song as Phoenix sheds a tear and Hoffman has the veins popping out of his head with contrived intensity is too ridiculous to be believed and marks one of the rare missteps in these performers' careers. Anderson has reportedly admitted that he went into the editing room without a clear idea of the story, and then only later decided after the fact to concentrate on the ""love story"" between the two men. The haphazard and aimless structure shows as much. Yet this exercise in narrative laziness only engenders further praise from the mindless PTA fanboys.Don't let the fanboy lemmings bully you into denying what you will instinctively discover for yourself here. The Emperor Has No Clothes. The Master is simply awful."
129,The Master,5,1 October 2013,General thoughts and feelings 10 minutes after watching,"It's a drama of parts which don't always go together, not even in the random fashion some films have. Disjointed might be too strong a word, but not really flowing or compelling either. The only common flow throughout is the music, which is pleasant, though rather bland after a while. Some of the philosophical ideas have a pretence of depth, but this is dashed near the end with a few words of a lesser character, so it rather destroys itself. There are moments of seeming intensity, but nothing to really lift the film at all. If it wasn't that some of the actors are superb, it would be entirely dire. Not exactly a waste of my time.Someone once said that the definition of a true bore is not someone who is not interesting or engaging at all, but someone who is a 'tiny' bit interesting or engaging so you can't quite pull away from them. This film was it.."
130,The Master,5,7 September 2013,Masterful story not told well,"Joaquin Phoenix plays Quell, a World War II veteran trying and failing to adjust to a postwar life with a series of jobs that fail. He seems to be obsessed with sex, rule breaking, drink and violence. He has a penchant for making his own moonshine and one night he enters a boat where a party is taking place and meets Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), a leader of a cult called 'The Cause.' Hoffman accepts him into the movement after processing him and also likes his moonshine. However, Quell is regarded as being mentally erratic, violent and an alcoholic, Dodds wife and family are sceptical of him which leads him to being processed more vigorously by Dodd's. At the same time Dodd's methods arouse the suspicion of the police and others who are sceptical of his movement.The Master is an infuriating film, it gets interesting, you feel this is a take on the beginnings of Scientology (who have regular auditing of its members)and similar cult like movements that emerged in the post war period and an examination of damaged men. Yet the final act is a let down, Writer-director Anderson literally has lost the plot.You sense Quell is disappointed that Dodd's revelation of Book 2 is such a dud and he even beats up the publisher who admits the book is not very good and we have a scene where he simply rides out of the desert and leaving the cult more in keeping with the character. Instead the film goes on with some closure relating to his girlfriend he walked out on and then the scenes set in England with Dodd's serenading him out of the movement.It was unsatisfactory, we know that Quell remains a drunk and has no intent in changing his erratic behaviour which adds to the impression that the cult's processing is a failure as it has not worked on Quell who has intensive processing.The acting is uniformly good. Phoenix channels Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty (Bonnie & Clyde) in his performance, however I always had the feeling he looked too old to play Quell who seemed to be a troubled young man and Phoenix is in his late 30s and looks it. Amy Adams comes out best as the Master's latest wife and is most suspicious of Quell. Hoffman, a person who I always regard the 'whoop whoop' guy from previous films such as Twister and Scent of a Woman shows he has a fine singing voice and worked hard in his characterisation. Its weird to think he is only in his mid 40s as he looks and seems to be playing guys much older.Anderson directed Tom Cruise to an Oscar nominated performance in Magnolia and Hoffman has appeared with Cruise both in Magnolia and Mission Impossible 3, whilst Pheonix appeared with John Travolta in Ladder 49. So all three might have more insights with cults similar to the Cause which might have helped with their performances and with Anderson in writing the script. However the disappointing, meandering and plainly boring final act means that this is a film without substance."
131,The Master,9,1 April 2013,A masterpiece,"Simply wonderful. A masterpiece. The acting was superb. I've read a few critiques talking about a mediocre film. Then I watched it, and wow... I am just wondering, how can one criticize a diamond, waste his time looking for a scratch, for an imperfection on it's shinny surface. This film travels you down to the soul of human kind, to the very roots of the self. How can one meet this extraordinary thing called 'life'? Knowledge versus ignorance, simplicity versus complexity,belief versus doubt, the point where the future meets the past. Two lives meet at that point in space and time that one calls 'love'. It's a wired, mystical love that goes far beyond the surface, it moves inwardly, to the deepest fears and hopes of that 'intelligent' entity called 'human'."
132,The Master,1,21 January 2013,"Pointless, Confusing, Rubbish","In the early days, during the creation of what would eventually became known as modern Scientology, founder L. Ron Hubbard summoned his followers off to a retreat. There, he reportedly delivered lectures which lasted a mind-boggling 70 hours. The science-fiction writer-turned-guru sheltered his growing band of worshipers. By design, they were isolated from reality. Completely removed from their outside bearings, they were left alone to their own vulnerabilities and striped of the ability to reason as Hubbard preached and pontificated to the point where his voice finally gave out. When the guru could speak no more, the revival was declared done and his flock of followers were set free. One must wonder what kind of desperate individual would willingly expose themselves to such delusions? Who would voluntarily sit through such a carnival of madness? Then again, anyone who managed to sit through the entirety of the recent film called The Master now has some idea of what those early followers must have experienced. Indeed, The Master is an abomination. One of the worst major motion pictures of the year, this is a thoroughly painful cinematic experience with absolutely no entertainment nor educational value. Worse, it's a monumental bore. How could the Paul Thomas Anderson, the same acclaimed director who gave us the utterly brilliant Magnolia and the nearly as good There Will Be Blood have created such a meandering misadventure that turns out to be such a dreadfully dull film from start to finish? Based loosely on Scientology's earliest days and the wacko charlatan (Hubbard) who lured thousands of devotees into what the movie terms ""The Cause,"" the artistic blank canvass seemed perfect for what could and should have been an intriguing and inquisitive examination of one of the most interesting yet least understood subjects of our time. Religion often makes for an interesting subject, particularly as a topic of examination. No matter what one thinks of Scientology and those who chose to follow it, the very true story of how a struggling novelist was able to create a bold new 20th Century religion and worldwide movement that came to attract some of society's most famous people merits a serious movie treatment. And so it was. One of the most creative directors of our time took the challenge upon himself and made what came to be The Master. Three of Hollywood's best actors were penned for lead roles -- including Joachim Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams. The production crew even went to the extreme of using a rare film type, so as to give the movie the authentic retro look of post-World War II America. Alas, all the pieces seemed to be perfectly in place for a masterful Master. The trouble begins with the confusing script and pointless dialog throughout. How do a screenwriter and director manage to team up and utterly fail to illicit even one single emotional response from the audience? No laughter. No tears. No sadness. No joy. No reaction whatsoever, other than increasing volumes of grumbling the longer the film went. Scene by scene, the creeping sense of boredom finally morphed into outrage. Seriously -- how does a film about controversial subject matter largely based on fact, led by one of Hollywood's top directors and three of the best actors working today manage to bore everyone in the audience? Let's start with monumental problem number one -- there's not a single character in this film worth caring about. Joachim Phoenix plays a mentally-disturbed loser drifting aimlessly from job to job. Completely unsympathetic, he eventually latches on to ""The Cause"" by accident and is taken under the wing of the movement's founder and guru philosopher, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Never mind that Phoenix is intellectually incapable of becoming a true believer. He's far too selfish to care about anything other than his next boozing session or sexual conquest. But he does manage to stay with ""The Cause"" for quite some time, beholden for sustenance to Hoffman and his wife, played by Amy Adams. To their credit, all three actors succeed in being repulsive figures. Trouble is, even though they are sinister in different ways, they really aren't very interesting. The opening scene, a nonsensical flashback of sexual vulgarity sets the pace for the next two-plus hours. Be warned, this is an incessantly repugnant film, which seems to take joy in employing sexual acts and ceaseless profanity merely for its shock value. For instance, what other reason exists for Amy Adams to spend two full minutes relieving Phillip Seymour Hoffman into a bathroom sink? The scene is pointless and profane. If that's your idea of ""entertainment,"" there are certainly more suitable films out there with better looking actors for that purpose. The film's biggest waste and ultimate failure rests in its unwillingness to examine the subject which it's purportedly about. Specifically, what is it that attracts seemingly decent people to follow this cult? What are the responsibilities of the movement's members (they are shown standing around doing nothing during the entire movie)? What's the basic philosophy of ""The Cause?"" How is the movement funded? Not only are answers not given, the questions aren't even asked. That a film director with the pedigree of Mr. Anderson would abdicate this unique opportunity to show more of this religion and try to determine the reasons for its appeal is baffling. Here's my gut reaction: I would have walked out of this movie midway through had I not invested considerable time in trying so desperately to care, attempting to connect to what I was watching, so desperate to grasp some sliver of understanding about a subject of which I know little. Instead, I came out of the theater more angry and confused than when I entered. Most of the two dozen other film goers seemed to agree, as all I heard was grumbling as the exit doors were plowed open and we were released from Anderson's pointless labyrinth of lunacy. This is a horrible film."
133,The Master,8,5 December 2012,This film could be a masterpiece but it is far too early to tell.,"This review may contain spoilers, if it is possible for one to spoil it It's rare for me to want to go and see a film again right away after first seeing it.In fact, this didn't even do that; after first seeing The Master, the new film by the brilliant Paul Thomas Anderson, I was just left feeling very uneasy about what I had just seen.I had enjoyed it, but I wasn't entirely sure how much or why.When I thought about it a bit and then saw it for a second time however, it all made sense.I recently had a discussion with some friends about the role of the film critic and whether one should merely describe a film and reflect opinion without spoilers, or whether they should be adding to the general critical theory of a film.While I'm not going as far as calling myself a film critic, nor that it's really early enough to properly consider where this film ranks in the critical canon of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, I'm finding it difficult to write about this film without really going in to it, largely because PTA implores us to (hence the warning).The Master is not a film about Scientology. It's worth making that clear right away.It takes influence from it, but it is more about family dynamics and psychology (and how these can be manipulated into any valid train of thought).What we have here is three central characters, all of who are fairly unredeeming and unforgivable, and none of who particularly progress in anyway in the film.It is a film about frustration of the highest order, and that includes us as viewers at times, one is often left feeling 'why do I care about any of these people? Why do I find them so compelling?' A lot of that is down to PTA's wonderful direction, there are many blink-and-you'll-miss-them moments where a brief movement or piece of dialogue tells so much with so little, and the fact that all three of Joaquin Phoenix, Phillip Seymour-Hoffman and Amy Adams are utterly brilliant.The dynamics between just them is compelling enough (more on that later) let alone for the equally great but occasionally marginalised supporting cast, many of whom are reduced to only a couple lines.For this is primarily a film about a patriarchal (and from one end, possibly homosexual) relationship between two men who ""inspire something in each other"".Seymour-Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd, The Master, is infatuated with Freddie Quell (Phoenix), as more of a son than his own, Val (Breaking Bad's Jesse Plemons), or his inherited son-in-law Clark (Rami Malek), as a test subject for him to validate his wild theories upon, and perhaps even as a lover.Quell however is a stowaway on an alien ship constantly running from his problems (or at least escaping from them with his dangerous cocktails) who perhaps would like to express himself more eloquently, but has some rather disturbing sexual/patriarchal/violence issues, which may outlast his time at war against the ""Japs"", but certainly don't help.He is dislocated and lost like the generation before him who survived WWI, and is easily snapped up into the sinister claws of The Cause.The two see something in each other that they themselves are lacking: intelligence/action, (perceived) stability/freedom, a ""conventional"" family/vice and desires... read more at www.ravechild.co.uk"
134,The Master,3,25 November 2012,Appallingly dreary and monotonous,"Yes the film looks occasionally stunning, it has some memorable scenes, memorable performances and an intriguing atmosphere, but after two and a half hours you realise it hasn't gone anywhere. Both characters are essentially the same person at the end and haven't changed or learnt anything. This is a film which pleases critics and the pretentious, but for most viewers it will be baffling, ploddingly slow, opaque and very very dull. You won't really learn anything about Scientology or New Religious Movements, as the film can't seem to decide whether to focus on Lancaster Dodd or Freddie Quall and doesn't draw any conclusions about either. The whole thing feels like a confused nightmare where you wake up in the middle of it, confused, slightly creeped out, but mostly bored."
135,The Master,3,15 November 2012,Amazing technique. Empty story.,"Throughout this film, all I was thinking was: ""Beautiful cinematography, amazing soundtrack (it really is), incredible acting, gorgeous design, wonderful casting..."" Meanwhile I struggled to care, struggled to find a story, struggled to derive an ounce of meaning beyond the obvious and, ultimately, struggled to stay awake. Sadly failed in all these struggles.Have had this reaction to PT Anderson films before. He shouldn't be allowed to write his own scripts, they are woeful: trite, boring, sophomoric. If he turned his substantial directing talents to great scripts by others, his films would be incredible."
136,The Master,1,22 October 2012,Worst movie in a long time,"I don't know how this movie is being rated as highly as it is. In my opinion this is the worst movie I've seen in years. The plot is indecipherable and goes no where. I'm not sure if the ending is real or imagined. There is no likable character in the movie. Everyone that I know that has seen it says the same thing. I rate the movie so poorly even though the acting is decent. This seems more like an actor's exercise rather than a real movie, kind of like ""Bug"" with Ashley Judd. But a movie without a story can't be a good movie. A huge disappointment especially since I've liked the actors and director in many other movies."
137,The Master,4,23 September 2012,The Master....bator,"Director Paul Thomas Anderson is quoted as saying in an interview after the release of previous film Magnolia: ""... what I really feel is that Magnolia is, for better or worse, the best movie I'll ever make.""After viewing this film, I can confirm and assure you that his own prediction remains true. Magnolia remains his one true masterpiece, on a level completely untouched by his latest film: The Master.The Master (I facetiously titled it The Master....bator based on the opening scene)has many parallels to the style of PTA's other film ""There will be blood,"" but it was even less satisfying than that sprawling colossus.Yes, it is an innovative film by one of Hollywood's more original talents; however on an intellectual level it fails to thoroughly tackle the complex themes it introduces and consequently also fails to deliver entertainment-wise.In fact, even the characters of Lancaster and Freddie, though well-acted are actually simply drawn and not nearly as rich as i had hoped. Lancaster's charisma is shown to be purely a product of his personality- Anderson does not successfully communicate his supposed dazzling intellect through the dialogue and Freddie's association with him seems to be simply due to a stray dog complex, rather than anything deeper. At least it makes sense that a weak master would attract an effete disciple.Perhaps the film would have been better if a more global view was taken to showcase the effects of 'The Cause.' Stuck in the blurry vision of a psychotic drunk (Freddie) the viewer is unable to see clearly and may experience dizzy spells. Gratuitous nudity is included as well."
138,The Master,8,22 September 2012,Oscar bait that is worth reeling in.,"For some of you, this may be one of your most anticipated movies of the year. For others, you're probably wondering what the heck ""The Master"" is. Unless you are a follower of director Paul Thomas Anderson's work (There Will Be Blood, Magnolia) or just an indie film buff, you are probably unaware of this film. This is a film I have been looking forward to for some time now. With trailers and clips slowly appearing online month by month, it seems like I have been waiting forever to sit down in a theater and witness what is without a doubt, class A acting. The film follows World War II Naval veteran Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) as he is having a frustrating time adjusting to the post war world. He can't seem to keep a job and is a sex addicted, raging alcoholic, to put it lightly. You witness his true downfall as he sneaks away from his job sites to make his ""secret potion"" drink that contains the likes of paint thinner and mouth wash. As he is accused of poising a man with this potion, he flees from his job, searching for a safe place to hide. He winds up sneaking aboard a cruise ship, where he meets Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Lancaster is a charismatic intellectual who creates a faith based organization entitled ""The Cause"" in an attempt to provide meaning to others' lives. Sound familiar? Well there are definitely ties between this religion and Scientology, there's no doubt in that. However this film is as much about Scientology as ""There Will Be Blood"" was about oil. It's merely a unique vesicle to help tell this story, and is used extremely well.This film is shot on beautiful 70 mm film which enhances your movie going experience that digital film, simply cannot do. The cinematography is truly breathtaking and every shot and scene has a purpose to the story. The acting here is simply top notch. I am willing to bet anything that Joaquin Phoenix, will at least be up for a best actor nomination this year, if not take home the gold. Even if you simply watch the trailers you can truly see the transformation and the dedication he had to this role, as a twisted and traumatized man, seemingly looking for some guidance. Philip Seymour Hoffman is impeccable as the religious leader, who us as the audience, questions ones sanity as well.What some people are criticizing the film for, as I have read in other reviews, is the ""lack of plot"" it seems to have. Well after sitting with this thought for a while now, I have come to a personal conclusion. It's not about the plot; it's about the journey we go on with Freddie. We start by coming off the boat with him, post WWII and spend the next 137 minutes with him, as he has moments of true downfall, as well as some (although brief) moments of a light at the end of the tunnel. There is a scene where Lancaster has to interview Freddie, which lasts about 10 minutes or so. It may have been one of the most captivating scenes I have seen in film within the past two years. Seeing these actors bounce off of one another, having such great chemistry was a true pleasure to witness, nearly bringing a tear to my eye. The performances alone are absolutely worth the price of admission.I cannot, however, recommend this film to the average moviegoer. It takes a lot of time and patience to truly understand and appreciate what is happening on screen. It's a slow film, with a strong message behind it. A message that can be interrupted different ways. I felt that I was going through this journey with Freddie. I was taking the same tests as him, feeling similar emotions to him and truly caring for him as you try and understand what he is going through. As the movie came to a close and the credits ran, I sat there for about ten minutes or so. Trying to understand what I just saw, trying to figure out if I liked it, or hated it. Trying to make sense of the last 137 minutes of cinema I witnessed. When a film can do that to you, when it can ask a bigger question than it is trying to convey, you know the director did his job right. Though it may run too long for some, may be too unorthodox and leave you with a sour taste in your mouth. I truly recommend ""The Master"" to anyone that is willing to take the journey. Go in with an open mind and leave with a story that will truly stick with you, for a very long time."
139,The Master,1,3 October 2012,Meh.,"Sorry, but every frame seemed to scream: ""This. Is. An. IMPORTANT. Film."" Quite off-putting, personally.Actors often ask the director, ""What's my motivation?"" I saw none in Quell that would substantiate his attraction to Dodd.I found both Phoenix and Hoffman to be over-acting.I found the script incomprehensible.And where was the editor? Nice sets and costumes though.One of the few redeeming features for me was Laura Dern's (character's) reaction to Dodd's 2nd book. That was the only thing that added value for me. (And I doubt her part was long enough to earn her any award mentions, sadly.)I found it very confused (and confusing), in general. As my grade school teachers would have said, ""Needs work."""
140,The Master,10,1 October 2012,The Master (2012) - What a Masterful Masterpiece! (Corny Pun Alert!),"Paul Thomas Anderson is one of cinema's most acclaimed filmmakers, simply because he always knows how to bring the truth out of the most unlikely characters, how to capture images that will help carry and give a message to the audience, and most importantly, he always has a unique and stylistic vision, unlike all other great filmmakers. His special gift is definitely noticed in films such as ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"", ""Punch-Drunk Love"", and ""There Will Be Blood"", and now with the release of his newest highly-anticipated film, ""The Master"", audiences have finally been rewarded with this mesmerizing piece of cinematic gold. ""The Master"" stars Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell, a clinically insane World War II veteran struggling to fit in within a post-WWII society. Going from job to job, obsessed with alcoholic drinking, desperately in need of sexual advantages, and easily ending up in plenty of fights, Freddie is living the rest of his life as an ultimate outcast. But, after boarding the yacht of Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Freddie finds out that Dodd is actually the leader of a philosophical movement called The Cause, and now after taking a part of this new religion, Freddie learns the secrets of life through the teachings of Dodd. Now, although this movie truthfully resembles L. Ron Hubbard's method on Scientology, ""The Master"" focuses more on the truthful bond between Freddie and Dodd. ""The Master"" is one of Paul Thomas Anderson's finest masterpieces that audiences laid their eyes on. Every single detail paid off with such masterful results. Paul Thomas Anderson directs this movie flawlessly, delivering an insanely mesmerizing and exhilarating detail in nearly every scene. Filmed in a beautiful 70mm frame, P.T.A has once again brought such wonderful images on the screen, hoping that the audience will find the symbolism and importance of the scene buried within. As for the cast, every single performance provided in ""The Master"" is just insanely brilliant. Call me crazy, but both Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman both deliver Oscar-nomination worthy performances. But, it's definitely Joaquin Phoenix that already needs to be handed the Best Actor Oscar, for delivering such an insanely phenomenal performance that easily steals the show, bringing probably the best performance of the year. As for Philip Seymour Hoffman, as always, he delivers an astounding performance that really shows the likable quality to almost every character he portrays on screen. Amy Adams is also simply terrific playing Dodd's determined wife, but we also get some terrific supporting performances from Laura Dern and Jesse Plemons. The cinematography is undeniably breathtaking, giving the film such a beautiful look. It just easily shines on the ""master screen"". The editing is top-notch, the score by Jonny Greenwood is absolutely magnificent, and the story is one for the ages. Now, what I have come to realize that ""The Master"" is not a movie for everyone. Not all people can appreciate P.T.A's unique vision, or respect the direction this movie was trying to take. But to those who actually appreciate the work put into this movie, only a true film lover can find it's true colors. Although a film not easily understood in it's first viewing, ""The Master"" is a movie that one will understand and appreciate, after plenty of repeated viewings. At a pace of 137 minutes, this is a mesmerizing, thought-provoking, well-made, well-acted, well-photographed, well-directed, and masterful motion picture that only true film buffs like me can easily grasp. ""The Master"" is definitely the best movie of 2012 so far! ""The Master"", in my review, ""an authentic masterpiece, beautifully executed, and affective""."
141,The Master,10,1 October 2012,The Master,"If you see enough movies regularly, you will know that once in awhile you will get a film that is triumphant and spectacular in pretty much every way. There may be enough average, or enjoyable films in a year, but not too many that you would call a masterpiece that deserves a place along with some of the greatest films of all time. I see many films and I know I may be too kind sometimes with how I review films, but for, The Master, I have to be openly honest and say what a complete and total masterpiece this film is and how it, to me at least, is one of the greatest films of all time. The film is a period piece and takes place in the year 1950. The film is not autobiographical, but you can tell it borrows a lot from L. Ron Hubbard the founder of Scientology and Dianetics. Philip Seymour Hoffman, plays this character named Lancaster Dodd. Joaquin Phoenix, plays a character that is traumatized from the war and probably has several other barriers and mental health problems as well, that we discover as the film goes along. I have read some complaints about this film, that people found it very slow, to the point of being boring, but for me I found the film riveting from the first frame to the last. Joaquin Phoenix's character Freddie Quell, is one of those characters that I think will go down in history for several years if not forever and will always be remembered. For one thing, he is marvellously played by Joaquin Phoenix, who with this character delivers the performance of a lifetime and is certainly the best performance I have seen by either actor, or actress all year. There is so many layers to Freddie's character that it would be doing the film injustice just to say that is character is an alcoholic and mentally disturbed. It goes so much beyond that and yet the film only gives us pieces of information, one at a time and what we have to put together, and our final impression, or thought about Freddie, will come from the information that is fed us through the film by the genius writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson. Phoenix's performance is full of passion and he shows this in physical ways such as body tics, or his posture, or just the demented look on his face. He is an absolutely fascinating character to watch and study and I enjoyed watching him and studying him for the duration of the film. Now we enter the character of Lancaster Dodd, who in his own way has an aura of mysteriousness to him as well and is a fascinating character in his own right as well. When these two characters and actors are on screen together, it is never boring and watching their wonderful screen chemistry and the bond they have with one another is writing and acting perfection. If they could give out two Best Actor Oscars next year I wish they could give them both to Phoenix and Hoffman, because they are so good in here and yet they play off each other and the two roles compliment and really need one another. The film shows the processes of Scientology and Dianetics, such as Auditing, and the removal of past traumas and events called Engrams, and the process in which this is done. Having read L. Ron Hubbard's book of Dianetics, which features largely the process of Auditing and the removal of Engrams, I have to say that Paul Thomas Anderson captures what I would imagine such sessions would actually be like. I am not a Scientologist myself, nor do I know much about the movement other than what I read in Dianetics, but contrary to that I have to say that I do not think this film will be offensive to Scientologists. I do not think the film condones, or praises it one way, or the other. Rather it uses it as the backdrop for this very clever and in depth character study. The film is also very good to look at with it's cinematography and time period look and feel. The film exceeds on every one of it's film making levels that I can not possibly cover it all in the space I am given here. To me though, what really got me about this film is the study of the characters and what marvellous specimens we have on display here. They are so intricately written and developed that we learn by watching them and are fascinated at the same time. The acting is some of the best I have ever seen and the writing and direction is perfection. I hope there is no controversy come awards time and that this film is highly favoured and honoured. It is the best film I have seen all year and I doubt that there will be any better for quite some time to come."
142,The Master,4,21 September 2012,"Gilded Wrapper, Empty Box","Funny, I compared it to 'Let there be Blood' before realizing it was the same Director's work. Caveat emptor! But therein is a message: if you are into tantalizing cinematography and little else, this is for you. Knowing little about Scientology and caring not to learn more, I lacked the requisite platform to treat this film in the context of that belief system. What I took from this film was that it is a thinly-veiled commentary on repressed 1950s homosexuality, complete with wrestling scenes far less interesting than Bates-Reed, packaged for the markets who want insights into Tom Cruise and John Travolta, but insured by the inclusion of Hoffman and Phoenix---both of whom are quite good, but vastly far from great. This latter deficiency as each was burdened by a poor script, and a context that might make this turgid mess penetrable. Had I been Hoffman's character, I'd have pummeled Phoenix with a bowling pin long before the ending.This one may be for that 'elite corps of impudent snobs' who seek to practice their 'Yes, but it had glimpses of Fassbinder with a dash of Bunuel' lines for the gimlet-guzzling blonde in the next booth."
143,The Master,1,25 September 2012,Boring Mess. Save Your Time and Money,"I spent the whole movie waiting for it to either start or end. It did neither. The Master has to be the worst movie of the year! I went wanting to like it. It was 2 1/2 hours of excruciating, pointless boredom. People were actually walking out of the theater. I think the ones who didn't walk out had fallen asleep. I have a piece of advice for Mr. Anderson; The next time you make a movie, try having a PLOT! This wretched pile of dog poop made me wish I had never found a parking space outside the theater. A Honey Boo Boo marathon is more engaging and has people in it you care about more than those in The Master. Judging from the self-absorbed media insider's reviews of this mess, I'm sure it will sweep the Oscars."
144,The Master,1,4 August 2013,The Master,I watched this film and i just can say: I hate it! They were trying to give us a good view but... you know ? I can never believe that Amy Adams acted just like that! how could she do it? and Joaquin Phoenix! I loved him specially when I knew him from Walk The Line! but this character was repetitious and so close to Johny Cash when he was addict to drugs! I thought Master is a perfect film cos first I knew him from Oscars and I didn't watch it. I think this film wasn't adequate for Oscar nominations. Specially when there is some films like Les Miserables ! Also I think I should be honest and tell you what I really think about it!
145,The Master,10,25 July 2013,Extraordinary,"This movie is a piece of art, which shows us how important it is to have a Master to follow in our lives. Second, it shows that you can only offer help to a person, who you believe needs it, but you cannot help or cure anyone if the person doesn't want it or doesn't admit that he needs it. We are free to choose what kind of life we have - either we want to be happy or suffer. Joaquin Phoenix is a great discovery for me - he embodies many different parts of an unbalanced person: sadness, anger, love, hatred, envy, sexuality, kindness, mercy... Absolutely fantastic! Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of the best actors, who really lives his role. So much wisdom in his eyes, you start to believe him in the first second you see him. Big applause to all the creators of this brilliant movie!"
146,The Master,,2 February 2013,A masterwork indeed,"As a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson, I had high expectations. Sure enough, they were met. What makes Anderson such an effective filmmaker is his ability to inject every frame of his films with a sort of mesmerizing power, one that glides over you as you watch his work. You forget everything else happening around you because you're completely committed to the film you're seeing. Even when you're not exactly sure what you're watching, you give yourself to his films in a way not common to what is the normal viewing experience. Watching The Master is exactly that. It's a beautifully made, impeccably acted film that washes over you and leaves you in a trance. The overall effect is one that doesn't need to be explained. Like I've said before, for all of the technical mastery that many films have and the various complex themes and story lines that we often see, Film is really a medium that, like any other art form, consists of making you feel. That's what The Master does in a nutshell, and by the end it is nothing short of wholly satisfying.In 2007, Anderson's There Will Be Blood instantly gave us an all-time worthy performance in Daniel Day Lewis, a performance that stills stands among the finest I've ever seen and one that is already iconic. Joaquin Phoenix can stand firmly next to Day Lewis and not feel ashamed because his work here is tremendous. Of course I had high expectations, but nothing more can be said about him except that it's probably the best performance since both Day Lewis and Casey Affleck (in Jesse James) back in 2007. Hoffman is also working at an incredibly high level here, and if he wasn't one of my favorite actors before he is now. The man can do no wrong. And, to my somewhat biggest surprise, Amy Adams finally gives a really great performance worthy of recognition. Finally! Her performance in Junebug is one of the finest female supporting turns of the last decade but her other two Oscar-nominated turns just weren't great, and the fact that they got as much traction as they did was a big annoyance. Here, in such a weak year, she fully deserved her nomination. Even though it's probably her smallest role out of the four times she's been nominated, she does wonders with it. I already wrote too much, more than I wanted to. And there will be a lot more I will want to discuss in the future, but it's safe to say this is absolutely one of the five best films of 2012. The fact that it wasn't nominated for the big categories (Flight getting into Screenplay over this? Yeah, that's just laughable) is a crime. But then again it was expected. Is it surprising that I loved this film this much? No, not at all. After all, Paul Thomas Anderson is a master. Yeah, sorry for that."
147,The Master,8,10 November 2012,Destructive forces taking us on an historical ride through the allure of cults,"Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is a sexually-frustrated World War II Navy vet who struggles to find his place in the world when he returns to America. He excels at mixing highly-toxic liquids into consumable alcoholic concoctions and seducing women, but neither are self-fulfilling careers. Then he meets The Master, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a charismatic cult leader perfecting his writing and theories.Like all Paul Thomas Anderson films, ""The Master"" takes awhile to start clicking. But the strength of this film, like most of his, is the lead performances. Phoenix and Hoffman are absolutely mesmerizing as two very destructive men. Freddie is really just self-destructive, but Lancaster's charisma, money, persuasive insistence, and passion in his beliefs is an all-encompassing, external destructive force.Lancaster likes Freddie's alcoholic concoctions and proceeds to use him as a test subject. Freddie gets consumed into the cult's lifestyle as rich women take them in so the Master can teach them life secrets. Freddie, at times, is disillusioned by the Master's techniques, but when he returns ""home"" and thinks a 16 year-old girl is his soul mate, he is probably no better on his own.The cinematography was gorgeous, capturing the innocence of the 40s and 50s as well as the manipulative nature of the cult-like group the Master has formed. There was a scene near the end which eerily resembled an almost identical scene from ""There Will be Blood"" (2007), which can take you out of the moment. But Phoenix and Hoffman never leave the moment. As manipulated and manipulative they both are, I found I was able to stay detached from the story. That's likely a good thing."
148,The Master,8,28 October 2012,A strange one,"I'm still not sure what to think about this film. The direction is phenomenal. The crew is incredibly crafted. The cinematography is magnificent. But I didn't like the story. In fact, the biggest problem is that I don't believe at all the possibility of a relation between Freddie Quell (played by Joaquin Phoenix) and Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour-Hoffman). Quell's character is so unpleasant, so selfish, so basic, such a loser, that I can't think a second a sophisticated man like Dodd could find anything interesting in him. Otherwise, you can't watch it without loving the way these two great actors are performing together. The scene in the prison is riveting, like all the critics have said. But every scene between them is special. We knew for a long time that Paul Thomas Anderson is very good in getting performances from his actors. He does it again here."
149,The Master,9,20 October 2012,Anderson's Stuff Sticks With You,"This P.T.Anderson fellow makes movies in a risky way but in choosing intense dialog and camera work (particularly close-ups) he pulls such off in spectacular fashion. By risky I mean he provides little in the way of introducing characters, setting, plot, circumstances, etc. PTA's settings and introductions are sparse and stark (also see THERE WILL BE BLOOD). This can be off-setting and , to some, possibly annoying, but serves very well to get the viewer engrossed in the people more than the place, time, events, etc. After a while this viewer forgot about worrying about the characters pasts, the history at work and just lived in the moment along with the characters. When you think about in, in both this film and TWBB we seem to get characters who go through intense ordeals but really don't change very much. While one might say Freddy Quill herein appears to have ""learned"" and changed, Freddy is truly too dim to comprehend such. Rather, he's a survivor among a host of doomed prophets."
150,The Master,,23 September 2012,Two Brilliant Performances in a Haunting Film,"The Master (2012) **** (out of 4) Paul Thomas Anderson's latest centers on Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a trouble man who after serving in WWII finds himself wondering around, getting addicted to alcohol and not really having a place in life. This is when he comes across a man some call The Master (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who begins to make him see life in a different way. THE MASTER is pretty much about L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology but I'm sure for legal reasons this isn't ever really spelled out. I will admit that I hated MAGNOLIA but found both BOOGIE NIGHTS and THERE WILL BE BLOOD to be extremely good movies even if I didn't love them like most people did. This film here is without question the greatest of the director's career and it's rather amazing to watch because of how slow it moves. I'm not saying it's slow in a bad way, instead the director really takes his time letting the viewer get to know the characters and before long you're really wrapped up in what's going on and can't turn away. I'm sure many people are going to want to read into what's going on. I'm sure many people will be coming to the film just to bash Scientology. For me this film really doesn't take a stand one way or another but instead it gives us a couple of the most memorable characters in recent years and their journey is something quite chilling and downright impossible to ignore. Of course, one of the greatest benefits is that you've got two of the best actors working together and performing magic. Phoenix has always been an underrated actor and this here might be the best performance of his career. There are so many sides and emotions to this character yet Phoenix reaches all of them without a problem and is downright haunting during certain scenes. Even his rages of anger are downright chilling. Hoffman, who seems to be doing one masterpiece job after another, also delivers here. I really enjoyed how un-flashy he made the character and I really liked that he didn't just scream like a maniac. There's certainly some very funny screaming matches but the way Hoffman builds up to these moments is just magical to watch. Amy Adams does a very good job in her supporting role but I think there's no doubt that the film belongs to the two leads. Jonny Greenwood's music score really grabs you from the first time you hear it and it perfectly fits with what's going on in the film. The cinematography by Mihai Malaimare, Jr. is downright masterful and the use of 70mm is something I thought wouldn't work in a film like this but the visual look it gives the film shows that it was the right choice. THE MASTER probably won't appeal to everyone but even if you don't like the subject, the two performances are just so great that this is still a must see picture."
151,The Master,1,30 September 2012,"""Does  anyone else want their money back?""","A packed suburban theater proved the desire of the grown-up masses for good film, something 'The Master' failed spectacularly to provide.There was no story. Period. There wasn't even cinematic portraiture - the main characters didn't change over the course of two and a half boring hours: no growth, no downward spiral, no NUTHIN.At the two-hour mark, a member of the remaining audience (there were a number of evacuees) shouted, ""Does anyone else want their money back?"" It was the best part of the entire experience.Phoenix, Hoffman, Adams and the supporting cast were extremely competent. I disagree with the reviews praising PTA's direction: for example, the 'penultimate' scene (where the storyline would have been resolved, had their been one) was tediously obvious... although no one could've predicted the serenade.I want my money back."
152,The Master,2,4 October 2012,The Master,"I give it 2 HUH'S and a WHAT! All the artsy wanna be theater critics are raving.....give me a break. The acting is insanely good. Character development is great. All that's missing is a plot. It's like watching the life of a crazy person with no end or reason. All I can say is thank goodness Master did not write a third book or I would have left early. With a half hour left to the movie, my wife and I would have left if not for the others we had came with to the movie. It was apparent half way through that this movie was going no where fast. Out of our group 6, which included 2 Phd's to give use some credibility, not one of us would rec this movie."
153,The Master,6,8 November 2016,Critics couldn't fool me into liking this,"Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master left me very conflicted by the end. I wanted to like it because of the excellent acting and beautiful camera work, but I never really got into the bizarre and bloated story. The Master is an interesting experience, but not enough stuck with me to make it a truly enjoyable one.So as I mentioned before, the acting is absolutely superb. Phoenix and Hoffman give Oscar-worthy performances playing friends/(lovers?) that quite literally complete each other. The supporting cast is equally as good, including Amy Adams and Rami Malek giving great performances as Hoffman's followers. All the actors bring so many distinguishable features to their characters that there were points where I forgot I was watching a movie. It felt real and I was mesmerized by the acting many times throughout. The acting itself pretty much makes my entire rating. It is a shame though that the spectacular performances couldn't hold up the bloated and slightly pretentious story.The Master is a very difficult film to review, as much of the content is subjective in many ways. It seemed like the film was made more for Anderson than the audience he wished to present it to. To start, the film's narrative is never clear, but this is not really an issue. I can appreciate a film that makes you think but The Master came out so strong with so many different themes and tones I was confused as to what I was supposed to be thinking about. This made the film incredibly difficult to interpret even for an attentive viewer like myself. The actions of the characters and the story's twists and turns are never really explained even remotely. It's hard to feel immersed or involved with a story when it never really explains itself at one point. There was a tangible main story line, but this aspect was so muddled and mixed with other story lines that I was never really sure what I was watching, which led to an ultimately frustrating viewing experience. Putting the story aside though, the first 2 acts somewhat manage to be moderately entertaining once you stop trying to understand what you're watching. The final 45 minutes or so is really when The Master began to fall apart.It's easy to say that The Master is overlong, but I think it started losing steam and hour in and just fully lost me at the 2 hour mark. The idea in which the story is based around is stretched so thin by the last half hour that the film feels like its making things up as it goes. Picking at scraps and placing them carelessly into sequence hoping it would create a satisfying ending. It did not. My questions were never answered, but even worse, the film never even seemed to care about even remotely telling a cohesive story. Some may call that ""artsy"" but I think it is plain lazy. One of Paul Thomas Anderson's other films, There Will Be Blood, is quite unorthodox in it's story telling, but it kept things simple and clear for the casual viewers while providing deeper aspects for the film buffs and critics. I may get some answers after another viewing, but after such a disappointing first viewing, what would make me want to watch it again? The Master starts off pretty great but quickly starts trying way too hard. There are many great scenes early in the movie but there is a point where the movie seems to forget about it's viewers and just continues to ramble on about themes that we can somewhat grasp but never fully understand. I watch movies so they can tell me a story, not to give me a template of characters for me to create my own story. In total, the excellent acting is really the only recommendable trait I can associate with The Master. Sure, it is competently made and beautifully shot, but none of that means much when the film couldn't intrigue me enough to actually pay attention and try to figure out the enigma that if offers me. I was disappointed and it pains me to say that The Master is not even remotely up to par with any of Paul Thomas Anderson's other works."
154,The Master,10,28 October 2014,"Thought-provoking, artful and misunderstood masterpiece","Every time I see the general consensus for this movie on IMDb, I'm staggered. 7.1 for general rating is just abysmal for this movie, and completely unfair. It may not be for everyone, but The Master is one of the most powerful movies made to date, and Paul Thomas Anderson's absolute masterpiece.When stripped down and thoroughly analyzed, the very basic idea this movie presents is this: Can you call people devoted to a religious cause a family? Can such an environment be a place of safety? I won't go into it further so as to not spoil anything, but that's the main thing this movie brings to us, as a question rather than an answer. Along that line are several other branches of the story, many relating to deep-moving psychology and past traumas. The movie's approach to and presentation of this is rather unique, and presents us with many thought-provoking queries. Add to that some of the most intriguing art direction I've seen in a movie, a sublime cast and excellent directing and screen writing, and it's a movie that's as powerful as it is subtle, as welcoming as it is controversial. This is an achievement few directors have accomplished with such esteem as P.T. Anderson, which definitely marks him as a leading pioneer of alternative, powerful dramas in today's movie industry. While not everyone appreciates it, I'm still disturbed by the fact that so many disregards it as a kind of trash movie. Yes, it's different and yes, it's controversial, but all that marks for a pleasing break from the streamline movies that we receive today. I think this movie will be a future classic, and as final note I say: Do not judge this movie until you've seen it."
155,The Master,9,18 September 2012,A master who can't even be his own master,"The Master, as all good films do, requires the audience to engage themselves in a lot of thinking. I was not surprised at those who laughed at inappropriate places or complained that they couldn't wait to get out the theater. The Master is getting more and more intriguing as the relationship between Freddie and Lancaster is getting increasingly codependent, and the truth behind the so-called treatment is subject to more and more doubts and attacks. Towards the end, the abandonment by the master, and the poor attempt of Freddie to develop an identity as a master, created a strong sense of tragic, irony, and darkness. Freddie was nothing short of a monster, but he evokes my sympathy in the last few scenes. The ending is brilliant and powerful. As the film ended, a few thoughts came to my mind: How do people find or handle the truth? How do people LIE TO THEMSELVES as well as others? Who is whose master? How do they ""master"" each other? How people create their facades? How do people respond to manipulation? How do they choose whom to trust? How do a person's experiences/ environment shape his life? All characters have answered these questions through their behaviors. Paul Thomas Anderson has not left a single moment that is not addressing to these questions. Every scene has a point to make. It is interesting to notice that, Freddie has a resilient side that Lancaster has never had, that is, the courage for transformation. Regardless how unconventional or unorthodox Lancaster's approach is, Freddie did respond well and subsequently go through a positive change, from someone who had absolutely no awareness of his own behaviors to someone who embraces his past, though not totally successful yet, in order to sort out what he cares most. For him, Doris is what he can't let go most, because she is the first and only one who ever loved him, and her love was innocent, simple, unconditional, and peaceful. Audience can only see Freddie's tenderness when he thinks of Doris. At the beginning of the film, he failed to go back to Doris despite his promise. However, after the treatment provided by his master, he mustered enough courage to find her. When he realized Doris had married, he did not act out. All he did was just walking away with disappointment and hiding himself in a cinema. He did not pick any fight for no reason, which is what he would do in the past.In contrast, Lancaster, from the beginning to the end, he just keeps running. Apparently, he runs away from big cities where his research is torn up by scientists with no mercy. So he runs to the countryside, and from one state to another, and eventually exiled himself and his family to another country. Psychologically, he uses up all his energy to cover the flaws in his research and the lies he made. At some point, he was in the same dead-end like Freddie, being trapped by the craps they had created themselves. But unlike Freddie, Lancaster didn't try facing the reality. He could have made a breakthrough for his research if he continued working with Freddie. To a certain extent, Lancaster's approach did work on Freddie. Under the master's care (despite his selfish motive), Freddie experienced trust, loyalty, acceptance, and kindness again. If Lancaster had used Freddie's case as a starting point, and dug further into the approach used on Freddie in a formal scientific way, he might have developed some real treatment for psychotherapy. Yet, Freddie is only considered as an object in an experiment. His feelings is none of the concerns. Lawrence needs Freddie only because he is the only proof that can be used for his research. As soon as the research was blown, Freddie has nothing more for Lancaster to exploit, so the relationship ends. For Lancaster, lying and avoiding are easier. It is not sure how mindful he is of the fact that he can only find himself forever stuck with his BS of time traveling. Lancaster could have saved himself and Freddie. But he failed because he chose to avoid his problems. He cannot even be his own master. He failed Freddie in particular; his abandonment of Freddie is unforgivable because whatever positive happened to Freddie is once again destroyed. Freddie became a lost soul again. As a master, Lancaster is a total loser."
156,The Master,3,21 September 2012,"Hoffman rocks, but that's about it","Dare I say boring? Not quite, since I'm fascinated with any story or movie that explores the cult phenomenon, but honestly, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and it never did. Sure PSH is awesome as always, but one performance does not carry a story that pretty much goes nowhere and leaves you feeling like ""Huh? That's it?!"" I'm glad I didn't see a late screening of the film, or paid for it. For sure I would have given it a lower rating. The Good: PSH, interesting look at the beginnings of a cult The Bad: Seeing so many different ways the story could have developed but never did The Awful: Leaving the theater with that ""Once again I was duped into seeing a PTA movie with good performances and so much potential. Aggghhhhh!"""
157,The Master,2,2 March 2013,A total waste of time.,"The director is more crazy that most of the characters. Really, a waist of time. I would try to explain it in English as IMDb doesn't allow me to put anything in Spanish. I only put 2 points because the characters works really well, but in a plot does not worth a penny. The story line was unbelievably stupid. It was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Can't believe I spend 2 hours of my life seeing this bullshit. I would try to explain it in English as IMDb doesn't allow me to put anything in Spanish. I only put 2 points because the characters works really well, but in a plot does not worth a penny. The story line was unbelievably stupid. It was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Can't believe I spend 2 hours of my life seeing this bullshit."
158,The Master,10,19 May 2013,Fantastic film...,"What l enjoy most about Paul Thomas Anderson's work is that he does not create characters you instantly like. Freddie Quell, Joaquin's character, instantly disturbed me - from his curing yourself of genital crabs to attacking the male client he was photographing and basically beating up anyone who disputed The Masters work. It is in that creation that Paul captures me and makes we watch the ride he has set forth for this man. And practically every male lead in his films. They are gritty and survivors in their own way. I respect that. No cookie cutter smarmy characters like so many are produced in Hollywood films. I found myself fascinated by Freddie and The Masters dynamic. My favorite moment was the prison scene with Freddie and The Master screaming F--- You to each other. That was so real to me l found myself laughing and feeling for them both at the same time. And when Freddie returned to The Master after being released from prison-their tumble in the grass made me want to applaud! Overall the acting and writing and direction superb. It deserves every accolade it received."
159,The Master,,6 February 2013,"Hooch of memory, past self empties the glass","I know I will like this more when I see it again, because I'm already sifting through and discarding the useless bits, those bits that have to be there but aren't of the soul of the story. I'm also discarding Anderson's habit of a dialogue-based story, because all there is to appreciate here should be visual. But right now, all I can say is that all the stuff about Scientology hurts this as much as Eli's petulant god hurts Anderson's previous film. It is neither here nor there that this man is a thinly veiled Ron Hubbard. Let me just say, it's a marvelous film deep down. But writing Hubbard in there, and making sure that we know, means you have to have all sorts of extraneous scenesthe scene where a sensible outsider challenges him for proof, the scenes where we infer he is a swindler, the scenes of kooky 'processing' nonsense, the duped, servile drones, and so forth. The thing is Scientology does all its own 'outing', it doesn't merit a film exposing them as fools. And without Scientology in the thing, the notion of stored past lives could come to the fore with actual clarity.No matter. The story here is of a man who came back from the war a shattered being, or maybe he was shattered from the start, and the war merely shuffled the broken bits some more. All the Scientology stuff starting when he meets Hubbard on a ship, that is to illustrate that without the certainty of killing, the beach reverie of loose instincts, back in waking life it is all anxious and fluid, you have to be your own master. That is postwar noir in its essenceWoman on the Beach, Crossfire, Deadline at Dawn, wonderful films. But again, in the context of a devious cult, it is all a bit hard, notation where should be music.What is music? The letter he received, and us at the time doubting him. His memories of a girl back home, and us again being unsure of improvised answers, embellished truth like the happy pictures of couples he takesa startlingly effective motif that is sorely abandoned. The notion of a fresher previous self in the waiting summer girl, the semiconscious shift from memory to making it all up, to vanishing in your desert. The talk of bringing it all back intact, and living in it, and coming from Scientologist lips, us knowing that is all disastrous distortion.The (imaginary) phonecall in the cinema that 'ties up' the story, where he is still needed in life.It will hit home if you are past a certain age, this notion that you can look back at a certain time, this is not abstract, maybe for you it was the end of summer of that year after finishing highschool, when life could be everything, and you hadn't yet time to think about all the ways to screw it up.And it is powerful but could have gone either way.. Hoffman is adequate, but the film is what it is because of Phoenix. He tops Day- Lewis as far as I'm concerned, he has gone madder than his required role to wipe off the actor going mad. Truly masterful stuff.He makes up for Anderson lacking in visual invention, what Anderson isn't able to show in images, Phoenix pumps in his veins. Some of the filmmaking craft is impeccable, stately and brings the 1950's alive, but he needed to cut off from talk and drift as the man does through currents of life. Still, when all's settled, I'm sure this will be one of the year's best."
160,The Master,8,18 October 2012,"Complex film of life, pain, and daily emotions which are challenged with thought and belief.","Finally saw ""The Master"" and I must say it's a film that after viewing one can take many points and meanings from. It's a complex movie in my opinion that involves the daily struggles of life that combines with pain, thought, and emotions which are challenged by new direction and belief of something different. So Christian people don't panic this is not a science movie about different belief and thought, it's mostly a movie of one man's struggle and journey of his new life.Following the War War II years ex naval veteran the PTSD plagued Freddie Quell(in a raw and gritty performance from Joaquin Phoenix)all of a sudden finds himself a drifter and loner. That all changes when he boards a ship and meets an educated writer and doctor named Lancaster Dodd(in a top notch performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman) who runs a faith based knowledge cult who travels the globe spreading the message.Along the way the journey proves to be tough and bold for young Fred as his vices of alcohol and sex with young girl fights against him accepting his new belief system. Many scenes are very visual and mind changing it makes us question can we really see our future and is our past something that haunts us forever. Anyway the message that Paul Thomas Anderson(who's an A plus director)leaves us with is that we should be open to explore new thought and we should challenge our emotions and past problems to create a new cause for a new and happy better life. ""The Master"" is one thoughtful mind thinking film that each viewer that sees it for themselves will have to make their own call."
161,The Master,1,3 May 2017,"Though there's truly nothing at all to spoil, no major plot points to speak of","I can say with confidence that this is a movie for which I could explain every single plot point without spoiling anything. The only thing there is to spoil is that there is nothing to spoil. You don't watch this movie for the plot.Its score is good, the acting is TOP NOTCH, but it leaves me wondering why such talent was wasted on a toothless script. Quell is played to absolute perfection, this is one of the best actors I've ever seen. This movie is basically a showcase of his talent. The cult leader is really good too but Quell is in a league of his own. He's better than Daniel-Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood.It's a real shame that his talent was wasted here. There could have been so much more conflict between cult members and their detractors. It teases with a couple scenes in which detractors are punched a couple times but it doesn't go anywhere.It could have gone so much deeper with the hypnosis bits but nothing out of the ordinary is revealed about Quell in these sessions (however, the first one starts really good anyway thanks to Quell's performance, you're almost tricked into believing that something was actually happening there... unfortunately, even in this scene which is indisputably the best, QUELL RUINS IT BY FARTING AND THEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE FART FOR 30 SECONDS. SERIOUSLY).We could have slowly learned how dangerous and scary Quell is during more advanced hypnosis sessions, but no. This is teased though. In one session, Quell and another man are told to say whatever they want to each other, but no reaction is allowed. Some very cruel things are said to Quell, who then begins to threaten the other man, but this deescalates very quickly and when it's Quell's turn to say something to the other man, he says, ""I wish I had to fart, I'd fart in your fact right now."" At this point I was certain that the director knew exactly what he was doing - squandering potential. Maybe as a statement, as though it's supposed to be what being let down by religion feels like, whatever.Quell could have had a falling out with the cult leader. This is also just touched on. Just before they go to jail, Quell talks with the cult leader's son. The son says that his dad's full of it. Quell wrestles with him for 10 seconds and hits him once or twice, but it's really tame. Then after they're arrested, Quell mentions to the cult leader that his son hates him. Both men say, ""F*&^ you,"" at least a dozen times each and this is a conservative estimate. The next scene we see them in, THEY HUG AS THOUGH NOTHING HAPPENED WITHOUT A LINE OF DIALOGUE IN BETWEEN THESE SCENES. It's truly that bad.Think about where that could have gone. It was hypothesized between some characters that perhaps Quell was only there to steal the cult leader's ideas and try to sell them. Nothing develops beyond the speculation though and it's never mentioned again. Before Quell is asked to return to the cult leader at the end of the movie, I was expecting a bang.Admittedly, it's only because I had seen Anderson's last movie and thought he was doing the ""There Will Be Blood"" thing again, the whole thing was building up to this shocking final scene between the cult leader and Quell... actually, of course not. There was nothing building up, ever. Nothing was going to happen here. Could the cult leader have hypnotized him again, bringing up something real, freaking Quell out?They loved drinking Quell's concoctions together, it's how they grew close. Could Quell have eventually come to despise the cult leader during his time away, learning that he was just a hack? Could Quell have accused the cult leader of lying to people and maybe given him a poisoned concoction, telling him it was poisoned after it was too late? What ever happened to those concoctions anyway? It went nowhere, dropped halfway through the movie like everything else.I forgot to mention that at one point in the movie Quell steals something generic. Never again does he steal anything and this isn't mentioned. It was apparently just random. He doesn't act randomly elsewhere.Anderson is capable of better. This is too awful to be an accident. I think the message is this: ""Who cares about plot? This is a character study. I could build tension if I wanted to, clearly, but I'm willing to throw it away with a fart joke. I truly couldn't care any less and I'm willing to prove it.""Or maybe it's a joke? Anderson knows that people expect another There Will Be Blood and this is his way of saying, ""April Fools!"" This could have gone there so easily.I honestly think that calling it ""pretentious"" would be elevating it to a level it isn't on. Pretentious movies are so much better than this. ""Boring"" seems to imply that perhaps it's just lacking in action and it's simply dialogue- heavy. No. I just can't tell you how bad of a movie it is, while admittedly being an excellent showcase of talent."
162,The Master,9,27 April 2015,A Unique and Beautiful Character Analysis,"Released late September of 2012, The Master is the second most recent Paul Thomas Anderson film. It comes after his most critically acclaimed work, There Will Be Blood and had a lot to live up to after TWBB proved Anderson's skill as a technical director as well as a screenwriter. Expectations appeared high in movie circles in the upcoming release of this movie. The film appeared to polarise audiences and understandably so from it's unusual and almost eccentric approach to storytelling. The film follows a sailor (Joaquin Pheonix) in Post-WW2 America and his relationship with a cult, specifically it's leader Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). The film deals with the contrast in their personalities and while at first they appear as entirely different individuals, their similarities as two humans desiring basic emotions - love, respect and affection is highlighted through Anderson's subtle abilities to educate and inform his audiences. The two main actors' performances are absolutely incredible. Joaquin is only becoming a more impressive actor as he takes on difficult role after another and the late Seymour Hoffman delivers one of the finest roles in his outstanding career. The two's chemistry is unmatched in any recent character driven movie I have seen and I am certain scenes between the two such as Freddie's Processing will go down in film history in the future. Joaquin's ability to deliver such powerful emotions through creative and uncommon ways more so than solely through vocals is refreshing. From his hunched over and tight posture when offended to the soul crushing despair in his eyes when discussing his family, his performance is near shockingly realistic and he should be commended for such efforts.What may be unappreciated to a majority of viewers is the technical aspect of the film. Paul Thomas Anderson takes credit of directing and writing the film and his skills show here as equally as in TWBB. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, shot in 70mm for a majority of the film, the wide and majestic shots really stand out and add to the film's oddities while suiting a large majority of the spacious settings and the characters' frequent movements. Also the use of the fish eye lens to give a spherical dimension to some of the more intimate moments really helps bring you into the actions within. The film opens to a dramatic wide opening shot of the sea as the boat powers through it, churning up waves as Jonny Greenwood's stellar score runs in the background, setting the dramatic and powerful tone to follow throughout. Anderson really shows his ability to deliver character background in a short space of time here, for example in the opening we learn of numerous key traits of Freddie's in the first ten minutes. We first see Freddie in a U-Boat, looking disgruntled and emotionally torn. A quick cut brings us to his feet, he sits on a beach creating an alcoholic concoction from fruit on a tropical tree nearby and chemicals he has expected to have taken from the ship which he serves on, first introducing us to his massive drinking problem. Another cut and Anderson presents us with a short but vital scene presenting Freddie's social issues, unable to fit in and severely sexually frustrated. The other soldiers have created a lady out of the sand and Freddie examines it behind the others, pushing through the crowd and fondling the formation for an awkwardly lengthy period of time as the men look on at the bizarre sight. Anderson is a master of delivering detail without the use of dialogue and solely through what he shows through the camera and in his brilliant screen writing. Overall I adore the film. I find almost every aspect to be worked on and considered to a significantly high degree and although the many complaints of the lengthy run time and lack of dialogue in areas, causing viewers to become uninterested or unfocused, to appreciate the film's beauty I feel that these less dialogue-driven moments are vital. The film's vague and indefinite ending has too sparked off a lot of distaste surrounding the movie while I see it as extremely touching and a bold unconventional move on Anderson's part. I can only hope that more film's in the future are of this calibre and provide new and interesting ideas to modern cinema."
163,The Master,8,7 September 2014,The Search for Belonging,"2012 saw the return of Joaquin Phoenix to acting after a brief break so he can have a 'rap' career. He unites with writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson and works with some great actors in the thinly veiled attack on Scientology.Phoenix stars as a Peter Quell, a Navy veteran, an alcoholic and psychologically damaged. He is unable to keep a job and prone to anger and violence and when he hits rock bottom meets Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Soon Peter opens up to charismatic leader and becomes a part of the organisation.The Master is both a character study and an examination of the running of the cult, particularly the politics within the organisation. Peter is a man who is looking for somewhere to belong yet hostile to everyone he meets. Lancaster and his group offers that, using 'The Process' to allow Peter to open up. Yet Lancaster is also a man who is also not above anger when poked or questions from people within and outside the organisation. Lancaster's wife (Amy Adams) too is a major force within the organisation, acting as a power behind the man, influencing Lancaster and getting him to do her bidding.To anyone who knows anything about the Scientology Cult can see the parallel being presented. There is the obvious that both have insane and non-sensible ideas the cults are based. Processing is the same as the as Auditing by the Scientology, used to break down people and find out personal information about people. The idea of fair game is brought up, that if anyone who criticise the movement should be targeted and anyone who leaves are locked out for good.The Cause is not just a pseudo religious movement but it is also a family conflict as many of the Lancaster's family members have different views, such as his son who sees his father for what he really is, a charlatan.The Master is a beautiful looking film, having some great cinematography by Mihai Mălaimare, Jr. as he shoots the desert, the sea, the beach and uses plenty of long takes and tracking shots to show scale and allow the actors to have a natural, uninterrupted performance. But scenes in the dark were too dark and many scenes that play for too long and could have shorten.The Master is not Paul Thomas Anderson's best films, There Will Be Blood and Boogie Nights are stronger films. It is still a worthy drama, a well written and directed film as Anderson shows himself to be a auteur and his period setting and long, slow burning style is very reminiscent to Terence Malick."
164,The Master,8,6 September 2014,Joaquin Phoenix is electrifying.,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this film alone is a reason to see it. After almost a five year wait since his amazing work on There Will Be Blood, Paul Thomas Anderson delivers a good follow up on his resume of incredible work. Now this isn't in the caliber of There Will Be Blood or maybe even Boogie Nights, but it's one amazing film due to the film's chief strength, the three main leads. As with Daniel Day Lewis' Daniel Plainview, Joaquin Phoenix's Freddie Quell is truly a revelation. His performance is an unstoppable force, so electrifying to watch on screen. Joaquin Phoenix is giving his all here and he is truly adept to his character, so much so that one forgets that it's Joaquin Phoenix. His character Freddie is consistently walking around in a hunched posture, and he has this contorted smirk on his face. He is also a WWII war veteran who is completely obsessed with sex, making his own moonshine with paint thinner and he also happens to struggle adjusting to the modern world(1950's). Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great as the leader of the religious group Lancaster Dodd, a who have similar parallels to Scientology that call themselves ""The Cause."" As the film progresses Dodd is shown to may or may not believe his own theories he's preaching, which are some of his finest character moments in the film. Hoffman and Phoenix also share an impeccable chemistry between each other in the master and protégée roles. Amy Adams, without too much screen time, has a pivotal and an effective role as Lancaster's wife Peggy. She has a very sweet and sugary exterior, but underneath it all, her interior is quite the opposite. She is determined with fierce combated protectiveness, and throughout the film she masks this quite well, consistently fearing Freddie, deeming him to be dangerous. Cinematography is also beautiful here. The set pieces, the costumes, and the color palette all give off a vibrant look to the film, creating a believable 1950's atmosphere. The Master is a movie that will require multiple viewings to understand and catch any information you might have missed. I certainly needed another viewing to understand it better. That might be the reason why it turned me off a little. The film is more or less a complete character study and barely a narrative with some progression. With that being said make no mistake The Master is another hit from Paul Thomas Anderson. Phoenix is captivating and keeps you on the edge with his mannerisms, twitching and smirking lips, with a creepy and ominous stare. Hoffman brings a more subtle calm manner, but with some unpredictable moments of insecurity and anger whenever his ideologies are questioned. Adams who is not particularly a stand out, has an effective presence in the film, that one cannot help but feel that she brings some mischievous and malevolent feeling in the atmosphere. 8.8/10"
165,The Master,10,22 July 2014,First There Was Carl Childers (Sling Blade) and Then There Was Freddie Quell,"It is a revelation to find movies like this one, a movie without the same old tired plot of stupid car chases and bad guys killing good people championed by guys in stupid white hats with big muscles and athletic moves. What we have here is a movie like none other with the possible exception of Sling Blade, where similarly we have one fine actor, who can perform a complete metamorphosis, transforming himself in mind, body and all appearances into a character we've never seen before. That actor who did this was Joaquin Phoenix. And let's not leave out John Philip Hoffman who was made to play the cult charlatan Dodd whose religions doctrines change with the wind. I had to watch this movie three times and I think I still haven't absorbed all the hidden nuances. This is not a movie that is at all predictable like so many movies that are out there are. It takes you on a journey, a journey not cast from the same old familiar molds. It is definitely unique. There can be no other movie like it. It is for me and people like me who maybe have seen too many movies are bored to tears with what is out there. I want more movies like this one, though I realize there can never again be another movie like it or not even a sequel. Every once in a while you find something rare and special. I hear the producer of this movie has done other films I have yet to see: Magnolia and there Will be Blood. I will check them out soon. But if you haven't seen The Master yet, be ready for something rare and special and above all excellent in every respect."
166,The Master,1,3 February 2013,As bad as slow drawn out films get,"I would start of by saying SPOILER Alert but there truly is nothing to spoil.About as much happens in this as ""The Happening"" and i am a patient viewer. I was not expecting much or as much as the legitimate reviewers for this title.I would like to say there were some great performances by some of the actors but there was not really any performance to be performed.Please read between the reviews as you will find there are waaay too many good reviews for such a bad film.Strangely enough me and my partner both read the bad reviews after reading too many good ones.Sadly the more realistic reviews are the bad ones, also the bad one are only being honest.Despite reading the bad reviews i still watched this movie and with much regret.I'll end this review with the following: Tom Cruz apparently watched this with either the director or someone to do with the film and gave it the thumbs up from a Cultologist point of view.Nuff said :D"
167,The Master,9,14 December 2012,The best film of 2012? You'd better believe it,"This was always the film of 2012 for me. From the very moment I read of its inception my anticipation was undying, and while I eagerly awaited the releases of films such as 'The Dark Knight Rises', 'Skyfall', et al, it was 'The Master' I was most excited about. Why? It wasn't the Scientology analogies, Joaquin Phoenix's return or even Jonny Greenwood that had me hooked; it was of course, Paul Thomas Anderson. If you've read my review of 'There Will Be Blood' (and I doubt you have), you'll have gathered that I like him. For many cinema lovers around the world, this film was one that couldn't be ignored, primarily due to what Anderson had accomplished in five films; while perfectly good, it was only after 'Hard Eight' that he really hit his stride. We saw Burt Reynolds find something special in Mark Wahlberg, Tom Cruise become quietly judgemental, Adam Sandler do serious and Daniel Day Lewis acquire a thirst for a particular drink. Following the latter's phenomenal critical success, the question that rattled around was ""where will he go next?"", and after five years we have been given a deeply satisfying answer. ""We're low on plot"", Anderson remarked in a recent interview when asked to summarize the film's basic storyline and this comment does indeed ring true. Set in 1950, it essentially follows Freddie Quell (Phoenix), a drifter who's been discharged from Navy service. After floating through a number of jobs, he sneaks onboard a private ship owned by Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the leader of a cult entitled The Cause. However don't go see the film expecting a traditional narrative structure, as this is a work concerned with characters rather than plot. We are presented with a deeply fascinating study of two men, so different, yet so inherently similar. This is undeniably aided by two extraordinary performances in the form of Phoenix and Hoffman. Following all the ""Joaquin Phoenix's gone crazy"" hullabaloo that resulted in the Casey Affleck-directed mockumentary 'I'm Still Here', it was time for him to regain his position as one of today's best actors, and with 'The Master', he has not only done this, but cemented it. His twisted, gaunt and hunched portrait of an animalistic man who lives for moonshine and ""pussy"" is a true revelation to watch and probably the best performance of the year. He is complemented by the ever-brilliant Hoffman, a long-time collaborator of PTA's. Instead of portraying Dodd in an ostentatious manner, he delivers a practically flawless performance of subtlety and nuance, seen no better than in a scene where one of his detractors questions the Cause's foundations. Dodd is self-composed and charismatic, before his potential for volcanic eruption climbs from its deeply-dug hole. Also worth a mention is the wonderful Amy Adams as Dodd's wife Peggy who, while given significantly less screen time than Phoenix and Hoffman, is excellent nonetheless.There is no denying that Paul Thomas Anderson understands the art of the camera and makes it as much of a character as the characters themselves. Here however, he's working without long-time DoP Roger Elswit for the first time, due to Elswit's commitment to the (rather 'meh') Bourne Legacy, and instead collaborating with new cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. who paints endlessly beautiful images with the lens, adding additional layer and depth to the film, rendering 'The Master' Anderson's most gorgeous outing yet. It was a shame though, that a mesmerizingly visual sunrise-set boardwalk scene with Freddie ended up on the cutting-room floor. The visual side is brilliantly complemented by an amazing score Jonny Greenwood, which I found occasionally reminiscent of Jerry Goldsmith's 60s work, punctuating the simplest of scenes with a sense of unease and/or melancholia. One thing to note about it is that there is no real 'master' at all, instead we are greeted with two sides of the same coin with Quell and Dodd, which is illustrated to great effect in a prison-set scene in the film's second act, and also by the similarities between Quell's moonshine and Dodd's cult  both are dangerous, yet intoxicating creations of their own hand. Their encounters result in something common to PTA's work: the father/son relationship, here in the guise of a master/protégé dynamic. In this instance, Dodd is the intellectual and sharp-suited man of sophistication, while Freddie is a truly unpredictable and simian-like savage. In Dodd, he finds something that gives him cause to stay and his leader subsequently places a (loose) leash over him, best seen where Freddie defends Dodd from a skeptic, only to be scolded like a bold dog. In the end though, Freddie is simply a man painfully gripped by nostalgia, craving a time he can never return to.'The Master' is a breathtaking film from beginning to end and, in my opinion, Paul Thomas Anderson's best film yet. It is well-paced, thought-provoking and challenging, anchored by terrific central performances and lyrically visuals poetic visuals, featuring some scenes so hypnotic and powerful I couldn't shake them over a week later."
168,The Master,10,27 November 2012,The Price We Pay,"I lost track of the number of times I've watched ""The Master."" It's been six or seven and I'd still be going back if it was still in theaters. I found the film mesmerizing. It is for me, perfect in so many ways. I'm thankful Paul Thomas Anderson is making films. I've put off writing my thoughts down about this film partially because I've not had time because I spent too much time going to see it, but mainly because the film has such breadth of meaning to me that I find it hard to put my thoughts down coherently. I've read many, many reviews including excellent ones by Kenneth Turan (LATimes), A.O. Scott (NYTimes), and Ella Taylor (NPR). I like these reviews because I agree with them.On the cinematic level PTA has made another accomplished work of art. It shines on all levels for me. The acting across the board is tremendous and especially the three featured actors, Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams. The cinematography and art design are beautiful to behold and the score by Jonny Greenwood works perfectly. Thematically I think this film is expansively broad in scope. I see it as a sociological rendering of the past sixty plus years of the United States of America.The USA has been at war in all of that time and has paid a great price for that in many ways. The Master looks at the few years after the end of WWII and the price the ""greatest generation"" paid. The concept of a ""greatest generation"" is laid bare here. Freddie Quell and all of the men, women and children who survived that war and the wars that have continued unendingly have suffered this nation's inability to find an alternative.NPR's Ella Taylor put it much better than I am able. ""Without ever saying so, the movie adds up to nothing less than a social psychology of the nervous, spiritually questing geist of post-World War II America. After hard times were declared officially over and peace and prosperity were proclaimed, the legacy of the past opened a space for all manner of restless malignancies to take root."" This is not specifically a film about Scientology or cults, or alcoholics, or Freddie, or Lancaster, or Peggy or Elizabeth, or Val , or Doris, but it is a story about all of them and all of us right up until today. We wouldn't need a Lancaster Dodd to show us as individuals how we can save ourselves, if we lived in a society that didn't need to be at war with itself and the universe. If you've read this far you're the bravest reader I've ever met."
169,The Master,10,25 November 2012,Quite simply one of the greatest films ever made,"""The Master"", the new film from America's greatest living director, Paul Thomas Anderson, is quite simply one of the finest films ever made; in other words, it is a masterpiece. Even when, in the last quarter, it begins to loosen its narrative grip it is still head and shoulders above anything else I've seen in the cinema in recent times. It is the story of two men and the symbiotic relationship they share.Philip Seymour Hoffman is 'The Master', a character inspired by but not based on L Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. Here the religion or belief system in The Cause, a mixture of psychoanalysis, hypnosis, cultism and sci-fi mumbo-jumbo and Hoffman is its Messiah and yet he is not the central character. The central character is Freddie Quell, first seen on a beach somewhere during the Second World War, (and masturbating into the ocean), and then seen again in a series of dead-end jobs before going on the run after killing a fellow worker with his brand of home-made hootch. It is at this point that he and The Master meet.Like ""There Will Be Blood"", Anderson's previous film, this is conceived on an epic scale but is essentially an intimate character study of two very different men bound together. At times it looks and feels like the perfect adaptation of a great novel but is, in fact, an original screenplay by Anderson, literate, intelligent and significant. (Anderson is as fine a writer as he is a director). It takes its time in letting us into the lives of its characters, (a flaw maybe in that no other character is explored in the same depth; Amy Adams as The Master's manipulative wife, fine as she is, seems wasted). And yet ... and yet, however lightly sketched, we do get to know these other characters, these hangers-on and acolytes, (superb performances from the supporting players help fill in the blanks).But ultimately this is a film anchored by two great performances. Neither Hoffman as Dodds, The Master of the title, nor Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie have ever been better. Phoenix's surely is the performance to beat for this year's Best Actor Oscar though if ever a case can be put for sharing the prize between two actors then this is it. A suggestion has been made that Hoffman's performance will be put forward in the Best Supporting Actor category which should hopefully guarantee both actors taking home a prize while speaking of Oscars surely Mihai Malaimare Jr's stunning cinematography will also be rewarded as this is one of the most beautiful looking films in the history of the movies.As for the film itself, however, it seems unlikely to win the Best Picture prize, however much it deserves to. This kind of cerebral movie-making is a Hollywood rarity and the Oscar-givers run scared from a work that challenges as much as it entertains, (audiences, too, are unlikely to embrace the film in any great numbers), while a bland, self-congratulatory movie like ""Argo"" could well sweep the boards."
170,The Master,10,18 November 2012,A Master-Piece,This film renewed my faith in the cinema. The performances of the main characters are absolutely mind-blowing.The story is fascinating.It is so powerful and large in scale of the basic human conditions - a man and his master. The affect of war on the human psyche.If the Master was written as a book it would become an instant classic.This is the power of cinema. It's right here. It is Paul Thomas Anderson's greatest work.I am so proud to be able to watch him as an artist develop.Also the cinematography is absolutely stunning. The power of shooting on film.Please see this film as soon as you can!
171,The Master,2,24 September 2012,Insulting,"I caught an advanced screening of The Master a week before its national release and have since decided it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life.The biggest problem with the film is that it's a complete wandering mess. It has every intention of going nowhere, and it does this exceedingly well. The film is so overflowing with ambiguity that it seems P.T. Anderson's true focus was to be as avant-garde as possible, even if it meant he had to sacrifice everything that audience members could relate to; either on a positive or negative level, and thus the film - as a narrative - fails on a monumental level.If PT Anderson's objective was to try to covertly insult the audience then I have to give him at least some credit. Don't get me wrong, I still dislike him intensely, but at least this theory gives the film some meaning and intention. Otherwise, it's just a giant mind-screw not worth your time. Perhaps the whole film is just a play on how sick this celebrity culture is, or our addictive nature, or our need to follow the herd, our or thirst for control? Unfortunately I don't even care to know because there wasn't enough substance to pique my interest.I wanted to sympathize with the characters, but couldn't get past the conceit. I wanted to like the cinematography, but it really seemed a waste of 65mm film. I wanted to be amazed by the unconstrained performances but they didn't fit the pace of the story. There was far too much improvisation. The dialog was absurd. The film was an hour too long. There were so many things I hated about this movie I could go on forever.So I wonder why PT Anderson feels he has to be so mysterious? If he has something to say then he should just say it, otherwise, people might get the impression he doesn't know what he's trying to say and he's just trying to be provocative......I'm a member of this group."
172,The Master,1,23 February 2013,Willie wonka and the bullshit factory .,"Truly one of the worst films i've ever seen , failed on every level , no depth of character , insight into any of the subject matter covered or skill at storytelling .Can't believe how much hype its getting .Had the intellectual value of an action movie but no action .Bad acting ,unrealistic characters, stilted dialog, pretentious editing .i'd rather drink bleach than watch it again , and the whole ""you just didn't get it "" routine is absurd ,some of my favorite films are things like holy mountain,requiem for a dream and primer ,i'm fine with complexity , this just felt fake all the way through .pathetic , even if you watch it a million times .A film to make idiots feel clever, and shallow people feel deep .I bet it cleans up at the Oscars ."
173,The Master,1,20 February 2013,Worst movie ever,"Honestly, it's an awful movie. I usually don't write reviews, but I don't understand how this movie has a 7.4 rating, should only have 1.The movie is excessively long, sequences aren't attractive, even if Joaquin Phoenix has always done great psycho, there is no beginning or end to the subject of this movie.Even if photography is quite good, shoots are longer than expected, so you might find yourself looking to a boat for about 3min without anything happen.I though that due to this awesome cast the movie would be great, and also since IMDb had such a high rating should be good, but honestly, I can just say that those were the worst 2:15h of my life..."
174,The Master,10,17 February 2013,"Now, four years after ""Two Lovers,"" Joaquin-as-actor is back.","Our society tends to overlook the collective in favor of the individual, and film is no exception. While auteur theory originated overseas, its premisethat the director is the primary author of a filmhas been embraced to the point of perversion by American pop culture. Chances are anyone you talk to will credit or blame a film's director for nearly all of its successes or woes.Paul Thomas Anderson, who wrote and directed ""The Master"" (2012), dismisses this overemphasis on the individual, linking his success to the prowess of the crew behind him. ""You're really only as good as your dolly grip and your camera operator,"" he says while describing a tracking shot in one of his favorite films, ""The Earrings of Madam de"" (1953). In this particular shot, the camera moves beside a couple as they rotate gracefully around a dance floor.""The Master"" features a loose reproduction of this shot (Anderson, who once said he didn't mind if people called him ""Little Bobbie Altman,"" has never been one to hide his sources). The camera tracks alongside a department store salesgirl as she shows off an outfit to customers. She spins in circles as she moves aisle to aisle, past one uninterested customer to the next, eventually reaching Joaquin Phoenix. He smiles at her as he hunches over a camera at the portraiture station where he works. ""What time do you get off?"" he says playfully.Phoenix's last film was the somber romantic drama ""Two Lovers"" (2008). After that, he retired from acting and transformed himself into an aspiring rapper for what turned out to be a two- year performance in ""I'm Still Here"" (2010), a documentary by brother-in-law Casey Affleck. In addition to the deadpan humor and utterly convincing acting, Joaquin-as-rapper is fascinating largely because no one knewor even knows to this daywhy he did it.Now, four years after ""Two Lovers,"" Joaquin-as-actor is back.His performance is a physical oneevoking ""Sling Blade"" (1996) and ""Aguirre"" (1974)one marked in wide shots by the way he moves his body and in close-ups by the visual texture of his eccentric facial expressions.His pants go up well past his belly button. Half the time he moves it's in a stiff march with his arms swinging out; the other half he bends over and hobbles as if he has a back injury. When he stands still, the way he places his palms on his hips makes it look like he's dislocated both shoulders. In one scene he towers over a grown man, in another he is dwarfed by a 16-year- old girl. He speaks out of one side of his mouth and constantly smiles.The performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman, the other lead, is a verbal one. He is a charlatan heading his own spiritual movement (or cult, his critics say) called The Cause. Phoenix wanders onto a boat that The Cause is renting and becomes a project of Hoffman's. It's unclear whether Hoffman really cares about his newfound ""protégé"" (or anyone, for that matter), or whether converting Phoenix is simply a challenge he can't bear losing. Whatever the reason may be, Hoffman tells Phoenix he sees something in him, eventually explaining that they've met in a past life.What links the leads in the eye of the audience is something else: a hot temper. Phoenix is prone to erratic outbreaks of physical violence, while Hoffman bursts into a red-faced stupor when his beliefs are confronted by skeptics. These tempers themselves become linked: the former begins to have his tantrums when the latter is confronted in any way (be it by a skeptic, by the police or by a fellow member of The Cause). Interestingly, Phoenix's outbreaks have a calming effect on Hoffman, who melts into a heartbroken frown when he sees his protégé self-destruct.Some have argued the story lacks depth and direction. The plot is unpredictable and unstructured (at least with respect to traditional narrative), cutting from place to place and scene to scene as if it were all one big dream (there are claims that some segments are intended to be dreams, but I don't really see this). And as for content, much of what fills the plot will be uncomfortably sexual and too over-the-top for many viewers (warning: this is not a film you watch with your parents).One early scenea nerve-wracking interview session aboard Hoffman's boatcuts back and forth between close-ups of the two as Hoffman demands that Phoenix not blink. The end of the film places the two across from each other at a desk again (bookending everything that the earlier interview scene initiated), this time with Hoffman pleading for Phoenix to dedicate his entire billion year lifespan to The Cause.Thanks in large part to his booming voice, Hoffman steals every scene that takes place in a room full of people (as a charlatan should). Phoenix often slips into the background as if he were just another character, a maneuver made possible by his naturalistic acting. Perhaps the reason he feels so authentic on-screennot just in ""The Master"" but in generalis that he might be acting less than we think. He no doubt has great comedic timing and emotional delivery, but he's also strikingly similar to the roles he depicts. His characters stare blankly into the distance and respond to questions in a mysterious gargle, the way he does in interviews. They are defined, like Phoenix, by their disengaged nodding and mumbling, their drowsy smirks and pursed-lip sighs. And like his characters he is uncommunicative and unpredictable, yet gentle and vulnerableseemingly genuine, and genuinely bizarre.That being so, it's difficult to tell where Joaquin Phoenix ends and his characters begin. It's likely that neither of them can be understood, just enjoyed. The same may be true of ""The Master"" as a whole."
175,The Master,1,15 February 2013,An absolute mess!,"I suppose it is one of the worst movies of the decade. I am not averse to human subtleties, neither am I impervious to experimentation in movies but the movie is gross and stupid, a sort of bloody caricature of otherwise admirable human impulses. The western impulse to perfection in life seems always to be centered on the externalities of life, a life of science to be precise, but the deeper aspect of life has to be found and lived within. That idea implied there but on an external footing, a basis too weak and miserably short of depth in understanding. But if the Director would have us believe that he has just portrayed a certain human viewpoint as it had occurred to him, then I have no complaints at all."
176,The Master,1,10 August 2013,Writer must be influenced with some stuff when he wrote this...,"The only way that this movie will be reviewed positively is by over analyzing each scenes. Other than that, there is no way you can write anything good about this. It's like getting inside an addict's mind... which goes nowhere. Total waste of 2 hours of my existence! I keep waiting for something exciting to happen, which is the reason I finished the film. Acting was very good. But what's the user of great acting if you're acting for a non-sense movie???? I'm not sure what's the purpose of this film. I don't think anyone would know.WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!"
177,The Master,10,16 June 2013,"An extremely well done film, exemplifying the habits and family of a cult","Paul Thomas Anderson directed the film Boogie Nights in 1997, 1998, something like that. He's known for directing such masterpieces as Magnolia and There Will Be Blood. After directing There Will Be Blood, he took his longest recorded break from film: Five years. Now, he returns, with this film, the study of a new religion. The Master echoes Boogie Nights. A newcomer to a sort of cult, a group heavily burdened by controversy. In Boogie Nights it is pornography, in The Master, it is a new religion, very much like Scientology. The newcomer is welcomed. The newcomer comes to love the people in the cult. The story is played out fantastically, with all the acting being absolutely splendid. And the way the film looks on 70mm, is nothing short of mind-blowing. I love Nolan, but honestly, Anderson makes better use of the film. Every single shot is absolutely perfect, and amazingly filmed. The dialogue is amazing, as always with Anderson films. Hoffman's character, the leader of 'The Cause', leads well, and truly defines the word 'Master', with strong words, along with unyielding vocals. Some say the film is pointless. I disagree. It is meant to show the beginning of a religion, it's rising, and it's founding, and the strength of it's leader. It's a spectacle. Watch, and be amazed. The Master says a line near the end, (and I'm trying to keep this spoiler free, so this is rather vague) describing how no one can live without a master of some kind. And he does make a point. Anderson isn't in support of Scientology in the film, he's using it as an example. And he does so splendidly."
178,The Master,1,27 May 2013,Good Acting Cannot Make Up for No Plot and No Character Development,"The Master is one of the only films that I've seen with good actors that is really terrible. It is hard to believe that Hoffman, Phoenix and Adams signed up for such a bad movie. The script they read must not be what ended up on the screen. The finished product had none of the basics of story telling like a plot and character development. After the actors saw the finished cut they probably wanted to sue the director for malpractice. Needless to say my entire family sat down to watch a good serious movie then settled in to a dreaded death march to the end in hope that the movie would finally make sense. It never did. Phoenix's character was extremely well acted but never changed. Adams looked like she would rather have been anywhere else. Hoffman was great as usual but his character never changed either. Random and odd explicit sex scenes appeared for no apparent reason like in a cheap movie. It was hard to even know what was fantasy and what was real."
179,The Master,1,26 May 2013,"A Quack & a Psychopath -- Please, What Was This Movie About?","This is the second film by Paul Thomas Anderson I have ever seen, and it's just as atrocious as the first one: _Magnolia_ (1999). I haven't seen Anderson's most acclaimed movie so far, _There Will Be Blood_; naturally, following the repeated disaster with this particular director's creations, I'm very hesitant to even approach it; but I'll give it a try. However, there is nothing redeeming about _The Master_: it's excruciatingly boring, empty and slow-moving. If you watch this at 150% speed, you will miss nothing, and save valuable time of your life. I literally couldn't wait for this ordeal to finish. You are treated to monumental 140 minutes of nothingness. Sorry, was there *any* content at all here? I'm not averse to watching movies about quacks or psychopaths; one of my most esteemed movies of all time is Billy Bob Thornton's _Sling Blade_ -- superficially, regarding the topic, similar to this one, but whereas _Sling Blade_ is a masterpiece of epic proportions, this one is a *dud* of epic proportions. Hoffman's leading character and self-indulgent artificiality unpleasantly remind one of that other hopelessly overrated ""arthouse kitsch"", _Citizen Kane_; if _The Master_'s intention was to be as empty, bombastic and boring as _Citizen Kane_, it has certainly succeeded in spades. The only interesting facets here were the teachings of the ""guru"" himself; they contained some good insights, despite the guru himself likewise displaying psychopathic qualities. There is literally nothing to say about this film, because nothing seems to be happening in it. For 2+ hours, you get to watch a quack who behaves like a quack; and a psychopath who behaves like a psychopath; what was the point?"
180,The Master,1,26 March 2013,The worst film I have ever experienced.,"I am going to make this short and sweet. In my 70 some years of watching movies, this is the worst film I have ever experienced! That includes some of those ridiculous space spoofs from the mid 50's. I think Phillip Hoffman is a great actor but this was even more than even he could save. The vulgarity in the film was close to a low quality porn film. The movie constantly made the viewers gasping ""What the hell is going on??"" No strings were tied up at the end but rather I felt the producer might have said ""Well we have enough minutes in this conglomeration, so let's just stop"" Maybe the viewers need a pamphlet explaining scenes like masturbating on a sand woman sculpture, naked women dancing around fully dressed men and many other outrageous scenes. I'm sure the writer of this script will scoff at my ignorance of his symbolism, but what should I expect from a creator of such a disjointed piece of trash."
181,The Master,10,24 March 2013,Excellent story about world war 2 disease,"I was surprised to hear that this film was shot on 65mm, but it wasn't printed on scope letter box ,Blu- ray or d.v.d..It was the ratio of the plasma t.v screens.or vista vision ratio.Another thing, the casual sexual attitude in the film was revisionist.The casual mention of the f word too.Back in 1950's sex was legally and socially repressed.Unless you were a Hollywood star and had a publicity agent covering your bad habit up or if you lived in Greenwich village. It was a risk socially and legally for any man and women, who wanted to have a one night stand,Especially if you were asking a woman if she wanted to f.If you told your military doctor that the blots looked like women and their genital and what they might have done.You got in trouble,I don't care if you were deranged by the war.Jouchuin Phoenix was very good as Fred,because of the effect of war, was a alcoholic ,who made his own brew,could not keep a job,At first he's a photographer at department store.Then he stars becoming interested in this model, who's modeling some coat, Martha,played by Amy Ferguson.He risk being fired taking her to the dark room,but she shows him her breast,but thats it.After a fight with a customer at the department store ,he ends up as a migrant farmer ,but after poising a old man with his brew, he ends up wondering.Then one day he stumbles on a ship,which turns out to be rented by a Ron Hubbard type non licensed psychologist Lancaster Dod,played by Mister Hoffman,who's promoting past life to eliminate physical problems.Aided by his wife ,Peggy,played by Amy Adams,his daughter from a previous marriage,Elisabeth Dod,played by Ambyr Childers.His brother,Val,played by Jesse Plemons as Lancaster. Son in law ,played by Rami Malek.This includes his followers ,who want to get cured from his methods.Even though Fred hangs around with them to give it a try.He really does not want to be cured.Amy complains to Lancaster that he's wasting his time with Freddy.This cult is supported by various wealthy people.Laura Dern plays one of the wealthy patron who invites them to her house in Philadelphia.Except the attitude, the costumes and hair style and hair cuts are accurate to 1950.The back ground music includes Kay Starr,I think?, singing standards,"" Get me Behind thee Satan"",Irving Berlin, and a converted concert piece made into a ballad.The scene in the beach were all the sailors are relaxing or wrestling .or making a sand cast shaped as a naked women, while Freddy suggestively masturbates looking a the sea, makes you think of film like South Pacific. The story is played very stoically.Good and unusual film. By the way Seymour was a good singer, when he was singing to Fred , the standard ,"" A Slow boat to China,""I got it from Red box, oops! It was Ella Fitzgerald ,who sang the Irving Berlin song and Jo Stafford sang ,""No other love. 03/24/13"
182,The Master,1,3 March 2013,Worst film since Keys to Tulsa,"The anticipation for this film was high. Nothing memorable was delivered except for the work of the two Amy's- Amy Adams in the role of ""The Master's"" wife and Amy Ferguson  in a brief role as a woman with an attachment to lead character Freddie Quell played by JP. JP spends most of his time with such a furrowed and tortured expression that it gave me a head ache just watching him. That  plus the film generates a Closterphobic feel. Except for one motorcycle scene, the movie seems a long line of close-ups and medium shots. And even though it is to be a period film, the film lacked any visual freshness. If you wanted a film that would have your audience conjure memories of musty moth-ball smells from their mental recesses  this was it. There is not one character one can develop any attachment for. And PSH looks florid and unhealthy. Even Laura Dern looked like she needed a health food infusion. If I had the choice of watching Bill Cosby's famously bad Leonard part 6 or this film, I'd choose Cosby's flick. It is more likely some kernel of a good film experience was missed in Cosby's film than in ""The Master."" The feeling I was most left with from this film was that I wanted my money back and my time. If there is one shot I remember in the film that was mildly enjoyable was with JP's character entertains a female co-worker  who is an in-store model and played by model Amy Ferguson. She was a character with life  in a film without any other compelling vibe."
183,The Master,9,22 February 2013,A lyric bromance,"I don't see why The Master"" needs decoding. It strikes me as a pretty forward film even though not everything is spoken out explicitly. You can argue that this is a take on scientology and I'm inclined to make that point. The movie's cult ""The Cause"" is a mixture of psychology, philosophy, religious glorification, Sci Fi and mentoring programs featuring methods of repetitive annoyance. The resemblance is apparent.But first and foremost this is a bromance about one exorbitant and lost soul Feddie (J. Phoenix) and one happy dominator Lancaster Dodd (P.S. Hoffman). There seems to be confusion as to what's going on between these two men and why it is they break up in the end. The answer lies within their well-drawn characters.Freddie just came back from WWII that left him estranged. I take it he wasn't all too sound to begin with. His sexual behavior and drinking problem are just two of the most obvious expressions of his excessiveness that often leaves him expelled from his co-people. Acting out drunk and masturbating in public seems to be the 101 of alienating people. But like all social outcasts what they really need is acceptance and some understanding. For example, he forms a naked woman out of sand on the beach and lays with her. The sand-lady  we can be sure  doesn't mind his shortcomings.As far as my memory goes we learn close to nothing about Lancaster's origin. We get to know him as an intellectual, self-confident cult leader trying to lead people to inner freedom by biting and controlling their behavior. There are some hints as to what got him there. He loves to drink the poisonous stuff Freddie home brews for people (and mostly himself). Lancaster, too, has some unsettled sexual urges (a tautology, anyone?) which is referenced in the scene where Lancaster lets his female followers dance and sing naked through the house (which leads to his wife, portrayed by Amy Adams, telling him to refrain from this method and to giving him a, well, hand job). So Lancaster has some of Freddie's excessive qualities in himself too. The ""Cause"" could be his way to deal with his unsolved matters and it might actually work for him. Anyhow, Lancaster is really far more ambiguous than Freddie  at least he is to me. But it's safe to say: he loves to be adored and obeyed.By now it should be clear why the two men fall for each other. Their relationship Is really quite functional. Freddie wants to be accepted and appreciated. Lancaster wants someone he can control and form in his own way. By submitting to him, Freddie gives Lancaster what he wants even though he doesn't believe in the cult's teachings (""He's making that stuff up as he goes along""). By accepting Freddie with all his flaws, Lancaster gives Freddie what he wants. They fit as perfectly as sadists and masochists do. But it's not healthy and, in the end, doesn't work.The crucial scene that ultimately leads to their break up is the motorcycle scene some found confusing. They're on an open plain. First Lancaster focuses on a distant point, rides there and comes back. Then it's Freddie's turn. He focuses on a distant point and starts riding the motor cycle never to come back again. The ""Cause"" couldn't put him on a leash. Freddie will not be controlled. And that's when it all falls apart.Lancaster only accepts Freddie's flaws if he can make him ""better"", if Freddie improves in Lancaster's eyes. That, he obviously doesn't. Freddie adores Lancaster only if Lancaster accepts him as he is. When Lancaster's wife (who might just be the actual brains of the operation) tells Freddie to quit boozing, she hints that Freddie's not accepted. On the long run their bromance had to fail. In the final analysis (to sound presidential): ""The Master"" is a psychological take on cults like Scientology and the people that are driven to them leaving us with the conclusion: it just doesn't work."
184,The Master,9,12 February 2013,The Master,"Perceived as my most anticipating film of 2012, THE MASTER is Paul Thomas Anderson's ambitious comeback after THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007, 9/10), 5 years interval may be too long for PTA fanboys, but again the wait is unmistakably deserved. Post-WWII, a USA naval veteran inadvertently hops on a yacht one night and is hooked on a cult named ""The Cause"", lead by its eloquent yet irascible master, while being an avid follower of the master, his perennial booze-abusive, sex-driven, violent nature enables himself to be the soul needs salvation, a side-kick and a role model, it also encroaches his mental realm and life orientation, eventually challenges his loyalty with The Cause and the master. PTA's trademark roving and tracking long-shots maintain as engaging as any directors could ever achieve, not obtrusive but impeccably tally with the storytelling; the retro- soaked palette authentically establishes a mystic aura of the inexplicable internal mechanism of how our emotion rises and falls, attended by a rhythmic score from Jonny Greenwood.Joaquin Phoenix gives me a first impression of Michael Shannon (whose TAKE SHELTER 2011, 9/10 is among my top pick of 2011), in a far gaunter figure, he embodies his character so devotedly and destructively, it is a privilege to appreciate his hunchback stance, the unique way when he speaks (English words evade me now, help?), his exuberance, his furore, his confusion and his determination. The erosive bitterness conceals in his gawky body is compelling and he is a war victim, a damaged good seeking for a rejuvenation, the master and The Cause may or may not cure him, anyhow, he still possess his free will, if only the power of repetition works. Philip Seymour Hoffman, doesn't need too much physique alternation though, is equally mesmerizing if not too overbearing, his mind-blowing delineation of the master's polarized volatility is another textbook archetype of performing art. Amy Adams, whose fourth Oscar-nomination in 8 years has wrought some dissent here, accomplishes an amazing expressionless supporting performance, her role doesn't require any ostentatious flare-up, but each time her composure and relentlessness exudes disparate feelings from inside (blithe, haughty, disdained, confident, commanding, suspicious, disgusted, etc.), and her ""milking the cow""coalition with Hoffman is simply petrifying. Grabbing only 3 acting nominations (with faint possibility to win any of them), THE MASTER's bumpy Oscar-road is far from triumphant compared with THERE WILL BE BLOOD, but time will testify whether it is an overlooked masterpiece or an elusive piece of self- indulgent, but no matter on which case, one cannot deny that it heralds that PTA is most probably on his way to be the Stanley Kubrick of our generation (not least suggested by the evocative nudity scenes which seemingly pay tribute to the masked orgy in EYES WIDE SHUT 1999, 8/10), and it is a tremendous blessing for all the cinephiles."
185,The Master,9,6 February 2013,Paul Thomas Anderson is The Master,"¨If you figure out a way to live without a master, any master, be sure to let the rest of us know, for you would be the first in the history of the world.¨The Master is a magnetic and hypnotic film, one that is definitely not for the casual viewer and that will require multiple viewings if you want to grasp the many different meanings of the film. I am not sure I really understood everything, but I can honestly say that I was hooked from the beginning and attracted to these characters that were searching for answers in life in an unusual way. Paul Thomas Anderson himself has become a master in directing these films with multiple meanings and interpretations through his character studies. He takes more time than other directors (this was made five years after There Will Be Blood, and 10 years after Punch-Drunk Love) and this is only his sixth feature film since he began directing in 1996 (between 96 and 99 he directed three films: Sydney, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia). He has slowed down and taken time with his movies now trying to perfect his craft by creating fully developed characters. Anderson has created a fan base and critics tend to love his films, but his movies aren't for everyone as they require a serious audience because they can be challenging at times. Another thing Anderson has learned to do very well over time is to get the best performance from his actors. In There Will Be Blood, Daniel Day Lewis was spectacular, in Punch-Drunk Love we saw Adam Sandler give the performance of his life time, and now in The Master Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman give tremendous and powerful performances. Their characters in this film are what make this movie so hypnotic and engaging. They have tremendous chemistry together and there are several hidden meanings behind their performances open to various interpretations. They had a tremendous script to work with as well since Anderson has become a master at creating these challenging character studies. This is a very smart and well crafted film and one that you need to pay close attention too. We are introduced from the very opening scene to a World War II naval veteran, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), who seems to have suffered a very traumatic experience. He's an alcoholic, in one scene we even see him drinking gasoline from the ship, and he is constantly mixing alcohol with toxic substances. He's a very disturbed and troubled man suffering from PTSD breakdowns, we see him having trouble to adapt to normal society picking fights with his customers while working as a photographer and constantly drinking and thinking about sex. He has an incident where he might have killed a man when he offered him one of his poisonous drinks which he has learned to digest. While running away from a couple of men after that incident he hides out on a ship where he's introduced to a sort of strange cult known as The Cause. He befriends Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), who the rest of the crew call the Master, and the two take a liking for each other. The Master is a very charismatic leader who finds in Freddie someone who he can help to clear his emotions. Through a series of questions which the master calls processing he tries to help Freddie. Freddie becomes part of the movement as he joins Lancaster and his wife, Peggy (Amy Adams) as sort of their right hand man. The Cause begins to grow thanks to the Master's leadership, but Freddie still has trouble controlling his emotions and alcohol abuse. The only person in the cult that seems to like Freddie is the Master himself, who seems to be coming up with his ideas as he goes along with the movement. Freddie himself has some doubts about the movement as they go along. This is really a fascinating psychological drama with some of the greatest performances of the year. Phoenix's physical performance stands out above the rest, but Hoffman is so charismatic that he even attracts the viewer and makes us stick with this confounding film. It demands the viewer's complete attention, and in the end it rewards it with a fascinating ending open to many interpretations. There are several outstanding scenes like the processing scene where Hoffman questions Phoenix and brings up some things about his disturbed past. The scenes these two actors share together are all memorable; among my favorites are the jail scene and the final scene between them in London. Everything happening here can be processed in very different ways, but it really did satisfy me. Many people have said this was going to be a film about Scientology, and there are perhaps some underlying hints that can make you think that way, but most of all it is a character study between two men who seem to have problems of their own. I felt that by the ending of the film, despite Freddie's consistent troubles, he in a way tries to become a master himself. Perhaps he is the future Ron Hubbard, but of course the film is open to several different interpretations. This is a movie that hooks you from the beginning and will have you thinking about it long after the credits role. That is how you measure a truly successful film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
186,The Master,9,1 February 2013,under the spell of The Master,"Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master is one of the best acted and the most impressively filmed movie of 2012. And yet, I am concerned that as with another amazing film a few years ago which also enjoyed the acting of Philip Seymour Hoffman (I am talking about Synechdoche, New York written and directed by Charlie Kauffman) it is too smart, too complex, and too out of the mainstream taste of the majority of the viewers and of the Academy to get the Oscar Awards it deserves.Unfortunately I know too little about Scientology and about its founder L. Ron Hubbard in order to give an educated opinion about how close the image of the charismatic healer and cult leader Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman) is to historic truth. Not it may matter too much in the logic of the film which is not that much about a specific cult or ideology and more about the relation between master and disciple, between the strong and the weak, between the castles of imagination people build in order to cope with hardships of life and reality. On the way the film tells a lot about surviving wars (the other hero acted by Joaquin Phoenix is not much more than a human wreck having survived WWII with psychological sequels, a dependency on alcohol, and a lack of purpose in life), but also about seeking and finding guidance in life, about relations between men and the different ways of human beings relying and becoming dependent one of the other. The more I think about this film which I have seen less than 24 hours ago more details come to my mind, and I am sure that a second or more viewings will let me discover new meanings and new angles of the story. This is not a film to see, enjoy and forget, this is an experience to carry and develop.Joaqin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman give in this movies two of the best performances I have seen in the last years and each in part and the two together deserve Oscar awards for what they do in this film. Phoenix (I am so happy that he is back to making movies) carries on his face, body, voice the whole pain of the broken lives of young people who went to war and were not able to put together the pieces of their lives when they returned. Hoffman apparently has the allure and the charisma of the preacher, but he hides a whole universe of darkness behind this glamor, and acting has the merit of building a complex image of the character without placing a sentence, letting the audiences judge by themselves. Cinematography is another great asset of this film that makes the experience of viewing memorable. Mihai Malaimare jr. who already worked in two films directed by Francis Ford Coppola uses in this film non-digital cameras and a film format (70 mm, I am not a technical expert, some comments say it's seldom used nowadays) which both makes the image crystal clear and is similar to the one used for projections in the period the action of the film takes place. This format and the selection of colors make the viewing experience really special. The Master is a very special cinema experience which I feel only starts its path now but may become more appreciated in the future, finding its place among the best works of Paul Thomas Anderson."
187,The Master,9,21 January 2013,A great character piece,"Paul Thomas Anderson returns after what many(myself included) consider one of the best films of the past decade (There will be blood) with another fantastic character piece, this time loosely based on Scientology and its founder. Here, we explore the relationship between two fascinating characters fleshed out by Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman. To be honest, while Phoenix gives a phenomenal performance as the unpredictable, traumatized Freddie Quell, I found Hoffman's character far more intriguing and their relationship is, as we 've come to expect from PTA, masterfully written. Other than Phoenix, we have amazing performances by Hoffman and Amy Adams, all 2013 Oscar nominees. Anderson's superb writing is matched by his intelligent direction, and combined with a brilliant score and flawless cinematography the result is a wonderful work of art. The film might have benefited by a slightly stronger narrative, as it does take a while for it to absorb the viewer. Once it does though, you find yourself wondering, caring, studying these characters and the effect each one has on the others' lives.Once again, a wonderful work of art, (not surprisingly) ignored by the academy, recommended to anyone who appreciates character-driven films and intelligent filmmaking."
188,The Master,8,15 January 2013,Must be seen,"After taking forever to reach us down here in New Zealand, Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master finally has a limited release this week. I'm not quite sure how I felt about it, so this isn't a review so much as just a few thoughts I had about the film.Despite the lack of a best picture Oscar nomination, The Master is possibly the most highly regarded film of 2012. Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the most gifted directors around; his previous film There Will Be Blood is right amongst the best films of the last 10 years, and features one of history's great lead performances from Daniel Day Lewis. Expectations were obviously pretty high going into this movie.In a lot of ways, The Master doesn't disappoint. It is impeccably crafted from the very first frame. In my view, Anderson's greatest strength is his skill at telling a story through character rather than traditional narrative, and the characters of The Master are just so richly written, and played to near perfection. If Joaquin Phoenix's work feels a little big for most of the movie, it comes together brilliantly in the closing scenes, a complete performance. Even better is Anderson regular Philip Seymour Hoffman as the charismatic cult leader Lancaster Dodd, and as good as he always is, this is a role he will be remembered for. Holding her own against such imposing leading men is Amy Adams as Peggy Dodd, a fascinating character I would have liked to have seen much more of, and, in typical Anderson fashion, an array of excellent supporting players including Jesse Plemons and Laura Dern enrich the world of the film.Anderson's films are always tough nuts to crack, aren't exactly the easiest things to enjoy, and with the exception of Punch Drunk Love perhaps, exist in some pretty murky territory. This might be the reason why, despite all of its strengths, truthfully The Master left me cold. It's like gazing upon a huge feat of engineering. You can admire the construction of a 100-level skyscraper, wonder at the level of skill in its creation, but you can't really connect emotionally with it. It may be impressive, but is absolutely unfeeling. That's The Master for me. It is a film that feels like it is defying you to enjoy it, as if Anderson is intentionally keeping you at arm's length, and I was never able to connect with it beyond an admiration of the craftsmanship.That said, it is without question a film that demands to be seen, and seen, and seen again. I'm sure there are untold nooks and crannies to be explored upon closer analysis, and it's likely that I will grow to appreciate it even more. For now though, I'm mostly at a loss regarding The Master, and that might be the best thing about it. Few filmmakers have the talent to provoke such an unusual reaction in me, and it's a feeling I choose to savour and enjoy, rather than be frustrated by.tinribs27.wordpress.com"
189,The Master,2,15 January 2013,Shallow attempt by Anderson,"This movie has some good acting (both Hoffman and Phoenix did a great job), and great camera work. But the entire movie made no impression on me whatsoever. Not a single scene touched me. Story lacks focus and depth, and characters are undeveloped and difficult to relate to, despite great acting. We do not see the real motivation and driving force behind Hoffman's character, nor did I empathize with Freddie. Seeing a documentary movie about ""troubled"" war veteran would probably give you a much better picture of what his character was supposed to deliver. To put it bluntly: the story just does not cut the mustard. Unfortunately, great acting does not compensate for the undeveloped script. Anderson made some good movies which I enjoed, but the Master is simply not one of them. Hopefully his next film will do a better job."
190,The Master,2,15 January 2013,Master of the louse.,"Here's a good performance by Joaquin Phoenix as an obviously disturbed veteran who encounters a cult and its well acted leader played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.The movie suffers from the written and directed syndrome. It is way too long often redundant and mostly unpleasant to watch. Seems like a story that starts too early during WWII.Plenty of masturbation scenes. Lots of swearing. A strange fantasy nude scene with too many of the wrong people nude.It's really a bad time at the movies ""The Master"" should be avoided. If you have to go arrive about twenty minutes late."
191,The Master,6,11 January 2013,Strong acting in a rather vague and  obscure picture,"I probably did not choose the right time to watch the movie, or was not in the right mood for it, but I really could not find the motivation inside ""The master"", so much appreciated by most criticism. The movement called The Cause appears as much enigmatic as unclear in terms of aims and functioning: should it reflect the Scientology movement, the director chose not to go too much into detail, because in the end the whole movement seems to be pervaded by an aura of mystery and vague mysticism. Far from explaining the real motivations of the movement, Paul Anderson maybe did not want to offend a very powerful sect, or simply did not want to displease that part of the Hollywood star system which supports it. However, what I can state about the movie is that the excessive runtime of the picture does not help follow its sometimes tiring and tired pace. There are some strong visual moments, such as the long run on a motorcycle along a flat plain, really impressive. As far as acting, Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Symour Hoffman are both Oscar deserving, no doubt, their terrific interpretations are strongly physical and emotional, and leave the mark. But on the whole the picture proved obscure to me, and I could not get its real meaning and the reason of its favourable appraisal by the critics."
192,The Master,7,11 December 2012,"Great acting ; barely tolerable, ponderous film","THE MASTER (2012) *** Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Jesse Plemons, Kevin J. O'Connor. Filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson's (a)morality tale of sorts with Phoenix (in a phenomenal performance) as an unrepentant alcoholic WWII Naval vet whose inner turmoil cannot come to an agreement with his new found existence in civilian life that leads to an unlikely friendship/prodigy/master relationship with Hoffman (equally impressive), a charlatan whose braggadocios new philosophical religion of sorts has them both in a stranglehold for their collective souls. While the acting is top-notch (except for the too-prim and very odd turn by the usually reliable Adams) the film is receptive in theme and actions (watch Phoenix get drunk and unload - rinse/lather/repeat) and ponderous to a fault."
193,The Master,9,25 May 2015,Perhaps the most inaccurately rated movie on this site,"The Master is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It hits on ever note other than being entertaining at all times. Even when there isn't much going on, the beautiful cinematography and acting can keep you in it. The story is also incredible. It shocks me that it's not better rated. Paul Thomas Anderson continues to amaze me as he has written and directed some of my favourite movies including The Master, There Will be Blood and Boogie Nights. It also surprised me seeing the Oscar nominations as each of those actors could have one along with missing nominations for cinematography, original screenplay, directing, editing and best picture. I know I'm sucking this movie's dick a little bit but I think that is absolutely great and should be seen by more people."
194,The Master,1,22 December 2014,Didn't like it AT ALL.,"My local library used to charge a buck to take out films. Now they are free so I have been catching up: Scorsese (Wolf of Wall Street); some little Aussie thing called Shhh They Might hear You, Killer Joe with McConaghey (really good). but this one - no way.I always liked Joaquin Phoenix but it seems to me that I have a real problem figuring out if he is this weird in real life. I don't know. I never cared much for Hoffman, ever since Twister and will go to my grave believing that Toby Jones was a much better Capote.This film is way too long and and goes nowhere. There are obligatory orgies of course and even weirder sailor initiations - at least I think that whole thing on the beach was about. The part about homemade hooch was silly too. I kept falling asleep and not caring to rewind the CD.All I can say is, I'm so glad I don't waste my hard-earned cash at actual movie theaters any more."
195,The Master,9,19 March 2013,Mind-bending in its own way!,"Hitchcock was once asked who he made movies for. He thought carefully and answered,""The critics"". The Master was also made perhaps for the critics and most definitely for the director himself.By all accounts, it's a difficult work, providing no instant gratification to the moviegoer through its formidable 144 minutes. Most good films get by if the viewer is able to feel it, here we have a lot of thinking to do, the ideas embedded here do not reveal themselves upon casual scrutiny.A film about the founder of a cultish faith overwhelmingly modeled after L. Ron Hubbard, the controversial and mercuric founder of the Church of Scientology, and his relationship with a damaged war veteran is asking for pyrotechnics.But this film resolutely refuses to give us any. At 42, Paul Thomas Anderson is perhaps the most promising American auteur around and his small but uniformly outstanding body of work has an almost Terrence Malikian poetry to it.This is his most challenging and intellectual work yet.While the producers have taken great pains to distance themselves from Scientology and L.Ron Hubbard, the character of Lancaster Dodd and his ""Cause"" is clearly derived from Hubbard. Interestingly Anderson slices Hubbard into three parts, Dodd the charismatic thinker, his cold ambitious wife Peggy and the scarred Freddie.We see Dodd and Freddie engaged with each other at various levels, on the surface as teacher and disciple, master and slave, father and son, mad scientist and guinea pig and ultimately child and toy. In the final scene we see Freddie in bed with a woman he has picked up in a pub.He recycles Dodds compliments, calling her the bravest woman he has met.Life has come a full circle, and a shiny new religion is born. It will grow stronger with time as the self doubts of its founder are forgotten and his charisma grows.This film is an attempt to locate the genesis of a cult or a bona fide ""religion"" in a moment in American history.In doing so it adopts a dispassionate tone towards the birth of a new belief system, how its conjured up, fed to its early adopters, then to a wider set of people till it takes on a life of its own.The Master by choosing not to completely debunk religion makes a case for our inherent yearning for a spiritual belief system.While we are yet to fully come to terms with Christianity, Islam and Judaism and reconcile their differences, the personal stories of their founders have had the edge taken off them.Seen in another way its an oblique commentary on present day America, the cult of scientology is an extension of the cult of capitalism.The cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. uses the obscure 65mm format which delivers a kind of creepy intimacy with the lead characters, theirs faces come alive in an unreal way on the big screen.The filmmakers also used antique lenses to add an extra element of optical voodoo. Note the way the camera tracks Freddie as he is chased by farm hands after the liquor distilled by him kills a man.It follows him as he runs for his life in the dusty brown cabbage fields and slowly begins to diverge away from him, placing him alone and vulnerable, in a brown dusty field.The American landscape on-screen has a John Ford timelessness to it.As you sit transfixed in The Master you keep asking what is the point of all this, certainly not to entertain. But this act of asking is perhaps the point.Or we can watch The Wizard of Oz over and over again, if all we want is to be innocently entertained.The Master provides an important piece in the inter-linkages of the best films of 2012. While The Master looks at the birth of a religion that has the trappings of a dangerous cult, Zero Dark Thirty looks at what happens when a mainstream religion which must have appeared to be a cult once begins to get marginalized again.It throws up a character like Osama Bin Laden who is a distant cousin of L.Ron Hubbard.Then we also have Argo which is linked to these films in looking at a group of people caught up in the crossfire between the West and the madness of an Ayatollah while Silver Linings Playbook looks at the sweet relationship between two mentally ill people, a truly sick version of which we get in The Master.Django Unchained as a slavery revenge fantasy also seems to be a part of the same American history in which we have Lincoln, which traces the abolition of slavery by examining the realpolitik that Abe Lincoln had to resort to.Life of Pi is the most overtly secular of all films and perhaps its message of survival and spirituality binds all these films the tightest.Beasts of the Southern Wild delivers big on a budget as tiny as its 6 year old heroine!This was a good year for the movies no doubt, mostlycinema.com started this year ..now now.. I am behaving like The Master!Extracted and Abridged from my blog mostlycinema.com"
196,The Master,,26 February 2013,ZZZzzzz...,"Joaquin Phoenix plays a sailor who comes home from WWII, wanders aimlessly from job to job, and gets in trouble a lot. He then stumbles upon The Cause, a cult led by the Master (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and joins their life. Or not.I didn't understand or enjoy this movie at all. It is like one very long, boring, stream of consciousness, made about unlikable people who do nothing but talk in monotones with deadpan faces. In it, someone says of the Master, ""He's making it all up as he goes,"" and this could certainly have been true of the writer/director, too. It made no sense and I was glad when it ended."
197,The Master,4,20 October 2012,A Billion Years,"""This is something you do for a billion years or not at all."" This, to me, is a stunning line that is delivered with full force and cuts through the movie like a knife.How can you expect a resolution to a story that will not be approached in a millennium, much less in a couple of hours? The movie is fascinating up to a point. Freddy does not have PTSD, and I'm not sure he's an alcoholic: his brain is damaged from paint thinner. This changes the narrative of the film. Not much can be accomplished after that, so the movie drifts from being fascinating through the first 100 minutes to a kind of stupor in the final stages.Emblematic of life, to be sure, within a kind of arid emotional desert."
198,The Master,5,11 October 2012,Fascinating but pointless,"I couldn't stop watching this film. The characters and their interactions were intriguing--I was continually trying to figure who these people were and what they were up to. That kept me in my seat while I pondered what the heck was going on and where it all was going. I stayed the course, hoping that at some point, something would make sense, but, in the end, not much. This had all the makings of a great movie: The cinematography was great. The score was great. The acting was great. The dialog (what I could hear of it) was great. So this was a wonderful film in all respects, except that it didn't go anywhere or say anything. Too bad."
199,The Master,8,22 September 2012,"A challenging, difficult, flawed but rewarding film","Perhaps our most fascinating American director continues his evolution in a fascinating and frustrating film that I view with a mix of feelings. It could well be argued that this is a step backwards from ""There Will Be Blood"", and certainly, after 2 viewings, this lacks, for me the cohesive power of the best of Anderson's earlier work. Some will just hate it. The pace is slow, the message often oblique, there's no catharsis, no easy answers. Just two riveting characters being given riveting performances by two of our best actors, bouncing off each other, slowly giving us fragmentary glimpses into their souls. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the Master, a charismatic charlatan quasi-religious leader who desperately needs adulation, and seems to have long ago lost track of how much of what he says he really believes, and how much he's just making up as he goes along. Joaquin Phoenix plays Quell, an angry, possibly crazy young man suffering from what we'd probably now call PSTD after coming out of WW II. He seems to need a father figure as desperately as Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd needs to be adored as a father, so these two are drawn together, and yet repelled as they both can see the damaged souls under the other's surface, and in the eyes of the other see the reflection of their own wounds. So begins a non carnal love story between these two characters. Indeed, to me the film seems to be about love and how the American male has such a hard time asking for it, accepting it, giving it or taking it in any direct manner, so we start religions or become acolytes ·(or become porn stars or heartless oil tycoons). The only thing these two polar opposites seem to have in common is that neither of them can communicate without manipulation, or without burying their real meaning. And when they try to break through that, it inevitably pushes them apart.It's the tragedy of the American male, a theme Anderson has explored repeatedly (along with fathers and sons);we can't cope with our feelings, our vulnerability so we slowly pervert our need for love into quests for power, or violence, adulation, or domination or submissiveness. Whether it's ""Hard 8"" or ""Boogie Nights"" or ""There Will Be Blood"", Anderson's men are doomed by trying to be the men they think they have to be to survive, thus distorting their perceptions and their hearts. But there is a fuzziness here. One of Anderson's great strength as a film-maker has been his ability to make us sharply understand what's going on viscerally, even if at moments it's hard to get on a literal level. But, at least for me, there were too many moments when I felt lost in the bad way, not in a mystery, but a muddle. There are very interesting scenes, but in retrospect I'm not sure what some of them added to the story. I expected a second viewing to reveal greater depths, but for me instead it made the film feel a little more shallow, as if maybe some of the leaps in logic didn't actually have a point, but were just slightly unfocused storytelling. I would still urge anyone interested in film-making or acting to see it. There is some spectacular work here, dramatically and visually. But, for once, the sum of an Anderson film seems like less, not more than the sum of it's parts."
200,The Master,1,25 February 2013,Creepy and Lewd,"The acting is certainly stellar; that is undeniable. I think you are a bit dissatisfied with the end, in hoping that there would have been hopeful and great change in the seemingly hopeless character. Yet, it sends the message that cults often do not offer a real answer to the great questions of life, but are ego trips of self centered charismatic leaders. I understand a sailor is always going to be stereotyped into sexual and using profanity, but truly and truly they went overboard on the profanity AND the full frontal nudity. Further, it is a pretty long movie with some very dry portions where they were excessive in developing a character and developing a dramatic situation. I would not recommend it to anyone. You can get the same creepy feeling and sad story by watching Jeffrey Daumer's interview on YouTube."
201,The Master,3,3 February 2013,"Boring, boring, boring...","Couple of kinky sex scenes and nudity. This is supposed to hold spectator's attention? Please, this 2013. I really cannot write 10 lines of text so that this review would be added, any less than ten lines and we cannot comment even on movie that deserves nothing more than three words, there is simply not that much to say about this flick, except it was a frustrating experience to try to follow. I really cannot write 10 lines of text so that this review would be added, any less than ten lines and we cannot comment even on movie that deserves nothing more than three words, there is simply not that much to say about this flick, except it was a frustrating experience to try to follow."
202,The Master,3,23 September 2012,The Film Goes Nowhere,"I think that I will start out by pointing out the positive aspects of this film. The acting was very powerful and brilliant from this stellar cast of actors. There, I've said it. I went to Rotten Tomato web site (which I normally do not do before I review a film) and saw that this film was getting rave reviews. If these critics usually like a film, then I usually hate it, and visa versa. In this case I could not disagree with them more. First of all, the film was too long (painfully long). I was sitting at the back of the theater and when I heard the cleaning crew outside the door, I thought to myself, thank goodness, it's almost over. The rumor was that this film was somehow related to Scientology. If it is, then those folks are in la la land. Basically this film is about a lost soul who stumbles upon a cult (if you will) and becomes obsessed with its leader. The lost soul in this case is Freddy Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), who has some psychiatric issues after World War II ends. He accidentally meets the master, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) while trying to find shelter. The master quickly engages Freddy as a virtual guinea pig and pretty much shoves his beliefs into his scattered brain. Rounding out this pack of crazies is Mary Sue Dodd (Amy Adams) who is as devoted to her husband as any wife should be. Let's just say that she drank the kool-aid. Val Dodd (Jesse Plemons) never drank the kool-aid and was there just to support his father. By the way, I have to say that Jesse looks like he could actually be Hoffman's son. It's quite uncanny. Helen Sullivan (Laura Dern) is the devout follower of The Cause and has no issue with expressing her views. This is definitely an eclectic film and there is some nudity that was completely unnecessary. With all that being said, I believe that Hoffman and Phoenix may earn an Oscar nod for these roles. They were both brilliant. The story made me want to pull out my hair and run out of the theater screaming. I am not a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson's work and this film does nothing to change that. Normally I would say to wait for this film to go to Redbox, but in this case I say skip it all together. Stop the madness, I want to get off. I give this film a red light."
203,The Master,4,18 November 2012,Waste of time,"Can't understand why this has had such great reviews. Yes, the acting, cinematography and the soundtrack is brilliant; but all this just seems like window dressing. There's absolutely no story to this really long and boring film. 'There will be blood' got away with being a 'long film', there was an actual plot to follow.I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and by the end I just wanted it to be over. People were walking out mid-film.Such a shame, this could have been brilliant - but in the end, came across really pretentious.Don't waste your money watching it in the cinema if you're still interested in watching it."
204,The Master,10,15 October 2012,I don't know if I am disappointed or impressed...,"The Master, the film I have been anticipating for almost a year, starring the wonderful Joaquin Phoenix, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and even Amy Adams.Joaquin gives one of the most strongest performances I've ever seen in this film, he portrays his character wonderfully. You can really understand what kind of person he is, and basically, he's just a nut! At times my jaw almost dropped watching hi He was by far the best part of the film and he gave the best performance I've seen all year. There was one particular scene, with him and Hoffman together in the room doing a test, and I was just amazed. Hoffman's performance was also excellent. Phoenix and Hoffman as a pair was a dynamic duo, they truly nailed it! It was the best part of the film watching those two. The only disappointing part on the acting was Amy Adams. Her performance for me was just, ""meh"". I mean, she wasn't bad, but she wasn't really standing out, at parts she kind of ruined the scene for me.Paul Thomas Anderson directed this movie excellently. The cinematography was beautiful, and the way everything was played out was super. Through the movie, I did notice some goofs, but nothing to make a big deal over, it didn't ruin the film or anything.A big part that ruined it for me, though, was the writing. it felt like it kept dragging on to nothing, you keep wanting something to happen, but honestly, it doesn't really get anywhere. Many times i the film, you will also see that there are scenes added just for fillers, which really have no impact on anything, and make it harder to sit through. Honestly, the film had its good parts and its bad parts. When I was walking out the theater, I even heard people murmuring thing like, ""What did I just watch?"", and ""Well, that made no sense...""Something I did notice was the soundtrack and score. It fit the film perfectly. The score gave it a very dark feel which went perfectly with the scenes. The Master is a film full of excellent acting, cinematography, and a wonderful score. Sadly, it lacks the power of a good plot to keep you interested and wondering, ""What is going to happen next?"". Because nothing does happen, and that was the most disappointing things about the film. I love Paul Anderson, but this was definitely not his best. Therefore I give The Master a 7/10. If it weren't for Joaquin's Oscar- worthy performance it would have been a 6."
205,The Master,6,7 October 2012,One bizarre movie,"I know critics have been raving about this movie, so I went to see it today. And yes, the acting, especially that by Philip Seymour Hoffman, is very good, as is the direction by Paul Thomas Anderson. Some of the closeups of Hoffman's face are truly bone-chilling. Amy Adams must have been thrilled to play her equally bone-chilling role in this movie after things like The Muppet Movie and Julie and Julia.Indeed, much of the movie is bone-chilling. When I saw it, this afternoon, the theater was absolutely silent at the end, even though many people were there in groups/couples. No one said a word. Hoffman's character is a monster.But after awhile, all the unanswered questions got to me. I don't expect all questions to be neatly tied up by the end, but as with several other movies I have seen recently, this one just stops at one point leaving nothing answered, and that seems like a cop-out to me. Just what is Hoffman's character's attraction to Freddie Quell? Why does he call him over to England for that strange penultimate scene? Too many unanswered questions for me. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you, you may enjoy this movie more than I did. As I said, the acting is all good, and some of it very good, as is the direction. There is some remarkable cinematography here. The script, i.e., the dialogue is well-written, by and large. But after awhile, I got tired of the questions raised and never dealt with."
206,The Master,4,21 September 2012,"Somewhat interesting but fairly predictable tale of Scientology-like cult afraid of alcoholic, loose cannon drifter","Watching a Weinstein Brothers distributed film is usually a hit or miss affair. The Weinsteins are usually on more solid ground when they promote films directly tied to historical events ('The King's Speech' and 'My Week with Marilyn' come to mind). On the other hand, when they promote films rooted in fiction (films such as 'Blue Valentine' and 'Submarine'), they're usually nice to look at but their stories sometime lack verisimilitude. 'The Master'is partially in the latter category.'The Master' is very loosely based on the life of L. Ron Hubbard and his Scientology cult. According to Harvey Weinstein, the film is not about Scientology although the film's writer/director, Paul Thomas Anderson, admitted that Hubbard was an inspiration for the character of Lancaster Dodd (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman).Set principally in 1950, 'The Master' really should be titled 'The Disciple', as the film's protagonist is not Hoffman's character 'Dodd' but a navy veteran turned drifter named 'Freddie Quell' (played by Joaquin Phoenix). Quell is a bit of a nut case who learns how to mix really strong alcoholic drinks in the Navy by adding ingredients including jet fuel and paint thinner. When we first meet him before World War II ends, he's humping a sand sculpture of a sexy woman he's constructed on a beach. Later, due to his apparent unstable nature, he's the subject of a myriad of psychiatric evaluations by Navy psychiatrists prior to his discharge.Quell fares no better in civilian life. After obtaining a decent job as a photographer in a department store, he ends up getting into a physical fight with a customer after badgering the man by shining his bright photographer's lights in his face. Later, he's chased out of a migrant camp after poisoning one of the workers with one of his bizarre cocktails. Unable to form normal relationships, he leaves his girlfriend Doris high and dry and decides to resume his career as a seaman.Quell ends up on Dodd's yacht (actually illegally borrowed) who soon falls under the spell of 'The Master', whose intrusive interviews are dubbed 'The Process'. Anderson prefers to explain Dodd's nefarious brainwashing strategy in terms of his relationship to the unstable Quell---no conscription of other new potential converts is ever examined. Slant Magazine also points out that Dodd's particular cult hardly seems real at all: ""the film never otherwise endeavors to situate the cult in any film-specific cultural or historical context; as a result, we never gain any real sense of how large or influential the Cause is at any given time, which makes it feel like a function of the plot rather than a central, fully realized part of it."" Is there anything Mr. Anderson's could have done differently with his Hubbard stand-in? I imagine the real-life Hubbard to be far more sinister and charming than how Dodd comes off here. Perhaps his machinations are too much to be expected or simply not dramatic enough, to hold many viewers' interest. Dodd's initial 'processing' encounter with Freddie was interesting enough but eventually the control-freak persona, proves less compelling. With Dodd, there's little change in the character arc. Some may be impressed he turns his back on Freddie in the jail, his rebuff of Helen when she criticizes a word change in his book, his rigid stance in ordering Freddie to ride the motorcycle into the desert and then of course, Dodd's final ultimatum for Freddie to devote himself to 'The Cause' or leave the cult for good. But by film's end, Anderson's Dodd, is pretty much the standard Hubbard-like character we were expecting.Quell, the loose cannon with an uncontrollable drinking problem, is more interesting as the cult members are actually AFRAID of him. The twist here (and this is perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film), Dodd's cult is far more stable than the damaged goods veteran.What does Anderson want us to take away from 'The Master'? This has perplexed many people including myself. While Quell leaves the cult, he hardly can be viewed as having dissociated himself from their negative influence. In fact, while he has sex with the woman at film's end, he recites questions from his initial processing with Dodd. In the end, there are no great revelations here. As to Dodd's (Hubbard's) manipulative ways--we already knew about that, going into 'The Master'. As for Quell, I suppose he's supposed to be some kind of tragic figure that Anderson has given us the opportunity to ponder about. Some have suggested that he's a symbol of a post-war malaise. For my part, I would have much preferred to see a character who liked himself--that is, with some kind of ego--rather the hard-to-believe, empty shell seen here.Hoffman proffers up an Orson Welles-like performance but is saddled by the often ponderous script. Phoenix is too reflexively angry to be always believable. The female characters played by Amy Adams and Laura Dern have little to do, except reinforce our knowledge of Dodd's unceasing rigidity.By fictionalizing the real Scientology story behind it, 'The Master' avoids some of the more troubling issues that have become associated with cults today. The film's strength rests on its excellent cinematography, invoking a bleak, post-war canvas, reminiscent of some of the moody noirs of those days. But the slow-moving story often feels predictable especially in regards to the Svengali-like Dodd, who Anderson struggles to make sympathetic and different at the same time. Others will be confused by the film's overall point, as there's no one to root for, especially with such a grim protagonist, only perhaps very partially reflective of an actual, real person."
207,The Master,4,21 September 2012,Disappointing,"In a nutshell, Joaquin Phoenix is the entire entertainment value in this movie. His character development is outstanding! I also thought, what I'll call ""the psychology,"" of the film is well done. (Exploring the psychology of cult recruitment and a believable examination of a drifter's mind.) But, as I've read with other reviewers here, the movie itself is disappointing. With a terrific cast and a provocative subject matter, the story could've been so much more, but isn't. The promotions make it seem like it's going to not only be a character study, but also a look at the shady underpinnings of a cult.....it does with Phoenix' character, but is lacking in every other area.So, 4 out of 4 stars for Phoenix, 2 out of 4 stars for the movie as a whole."
208,The Master,1,2 January 2014,worst film I've seen in a long time,"Instead of repeating what all the other 1 star reviews said (b/c I agree with nearly everything...pointless story, letdown, etc.), let me just say this. I just wrote a comment on FB about Lars Von Trier and David Lynch being two of the best filmmakers of our time, and considered also mentioning Anderson, but after this movie I changed my mind. What is difficult to understand is how this film has an average of 7.1 stars. High rating reviewers describe the film as if they are talking about There Will Be Blood/Magnolia, but the fact that some of these foolish people would even describe this worthless film in the same way people describe the masterpiece that is There Will Be Blood is makes me a quite uneasy. Now that film is an absolute masterpiece, a perfect film. The Master, on the other hand is the EXACT opposite, no discussion. Failure on an epic level."
209,The Master,8,28 June 2013,A Powerful Character-Driven Drama with Outstanding Performances from Phoenix and Hoffman,"I never know what to say about a Paul Thomas Anderson movie. I'll sit through the movie, enjoy every minute of it, be completely drawn in by the characters and the beautiful camera-work, and I'll still feel as if there is something I missed when it ends. Such is the case with THE MASTER. There is so much to absorb in this movie and so much subtlety that I can't help but feel I didn't get the full picture. But I guess that's why movies like THE MASTER will stick with me for days after I watch it, poring over it in my mind and searching for a deeper meaning underneath the surface. I suppose movies that are so well done are always going to leave every person that watches it with a different interpretation, and I see THE MASTER as just an excellent character-driven film. It's not so much about what's happening in the movie; it's about whom it's happening to and how they react to the complications that arise. THE MASTER is focused on a returning Naval seaman named Freddie Quell following World War II. Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) has a host of personal issues; he's violent, addicted to sex, and a hardcore alcoholic who's keen on creating his own brew from whatever potent chemicals happen to be available. His post-war wanderings lead him into the presence of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), known to his peers as the Master. Dodd is the head of an unofficial religious organization that believes in the human spirit thriving over millennia in a series of host bodies and the healing power of examining those past lives. The animalistic Quell intrigues Dodd and the two become close as Dodd writes the latest book on the wonder of the Cause.As far as I can see, there is no central conflict in the plot. There is no over-arching storyline weaving through the film. THE MASTER is all about Quell and Dodd and the bizarre ""friendship"" that blooms between these two polar opposites. It should be said that Phoenix and Hoffman totally deserved their Oscar nominations for this movie. The two of them are fantastic together and their characters are so expertly fleshed out and intriguing that they stuck with me long after the movie ended. Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie is one of the best performances I've seen from the man. He completely disappears into the role. Quell is a hunched, beady-eyed walking disaster. He wanders from place to place, job to job, and usually finds himself run out after causing his usual brand of trouble. He's worn out and, most likely, living with some form of PTSD from the war. Quell was a real transformation for Phoenix. Lancaster Dodd is on the other end of the spectrum. He's intelligent, well spoken, and charismaticeverything you'd expect from someone at the head of a cult. Hoffman is amazing as Dodd. On the surface, he's a friendly man who bursting at the seams with good will and good intentions. But right underneath his smiling veneer lies a coiled spring of intolerance and anger for anyone that questions his authority or his eccentric methods in line with his Cause. A cult leader with a belief system with its roots in science fiction and intolerance for skepticssounds familiar.This sort of leads to an unofficial third player in this character drama: the Cause. The Cause is just so interesting to watch in action that it becomes it's own character in the movie, as portrayed by all of the sycophantic members surrounding Dodd in his quest. There are a lot of obvious allusions to the Church of Scientology in the movie, though it isn't a direct account of founder L. Ron Hubbard or the early beginnings of his organization. It's very obviously inspired by Scientology and their bizarre belief system, with sci-fi roots and a procedure for processing new recruits into the Cause. I am in no sense a supporter of Scientology but I've always found in incredibly interesting to learn about it's alleged shady dealings and their off- kilter beliefs. THE MASTER is probably the closest we'll actually get to a movie that paints the church in any sort of negative light, even if indirectly, by modeling the Cause on it's supposed practices. If I were to have any complaint about THE MASTER, it's that the Cause was almost as interesting as the Dodd/Quell plot and I wish we'd gotten more of a glimpse into it's world. Instead, the Cause (and any allusions to Scientology, whether intentional or not) is a mere background dressing for the two main players. The Cause believes that man is an enlightened species, far above any animal, and Dodd sees in Quell a beast to be tamed. Quell could be his biggest conquest if rehabilitated by the Cause's standards. But Dodd also appears to live vicariously through Quell, as if he provides the Master with an indirect taste of the animal life he's risen above. I don't know. The relationship between Dodd and Quell is complicated and that's what makes this film so engaging.I would love to recommend THE MASTER to friends, but this is one of those movies that general audiences probably won't gel with. I tried introducing some friends to Duncan Jones' MOON a while ago and, if that movie was too slow and character-driven for them, THE MASTER won't stand a chance. In my opinion, anyone who skips this movie doesn't know what they're missing."
210,The Master,9,3 March 2013,The Polarizing PTA,"Well, it comes as no surprise that PTA's latest effort is highly polarizing; personally, I believe The Master serves as further confirmation that he's a top notch filmmaker. JP's acting was out of this world and PSH wasn't far behind. The movie was exquisitely shot as well. Of course the story wasn't ultimately fulfilling, but isn't that the point? How could a charismatic huckster on a messiah trip and a highly unstable human ruin tormented by the lingering insanity of war make for a tidy little happy ending? Freddie drunkenly laughing up bits of the false prophet's bewitching shtick on the woman from the bar was a perfectly fitting, albeit disheartening, conclusion to the story PTA seemingly wanted to tell.The second skeptic that Freddy attacks has Dodd down cold (first rate mystic whose writings/philosophy are a twisted mess) and I think Freddie knows it, which is why he lashes out in mad rage against the unwitting messenger. Freddie is a wreck with nowhere else to turn (the totemic girl he idealizes absurdly is of course long gone), so he halfheartedly staggers back to the flock. Cult of personality figureheads can't effectively run parasitic hustles with doubters in their midst though, so Freddie can't stay without blindly offering up his soul. Organized religion in general is fraught with such complications running counter to the teachings of actual prophets who preach truths too universal to be wielded as weapons or shackles. Fear and coercion always enter the equation when human hierarchies are built upon timeless cosmic wisdom which is why the truly enlightened never teach that salvation is to be found within exclusive clubs. After all, one can't serve man and God and organized religion is clearly a convention of man. Conscience is our window to the divine, our bodies are holy temples and every moment of every day is potentially an hour of worship. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you and love your neighbor as you love yourself are all the spirituality anyone really needs. The rest is either a reiteration of the same theme or else deceitful smoke, mirrors and power tripping. You are the lamp to light the way. (Gotta love Buddha and Jesus, regardless of the shortcomings of organizations claiming to disseminate their teachings) Dodd's fraudulent egoism is irrevocably laid bare when he refuses to lovingly let Freddie go, instead vowing to torment him through future lives should they meet again. Dodd is collecting souls for his private menagerie, not setting them free. The acting in this scene is amazing. Freddie came to Dodd broken and is leaving the same way. Is it any wonder? The round trip journey he takes (that is to say, the film) is beauty, chaos, anger, hope, despair, and ultimately disappointment. I can't see why anyone would need to watch The Master ten times to understand that. Even if a person doesn't care for bummers or finds the story to be uneven, how could they deny the beautiful cinematography and world class acting? I enthusiastically loved the first half of the film and found the rest to be unsettling and finally rather discouraging. In retrospect, I realized that such a trajectory closely mirrors my perspective on the organized religion experience, be it Scientology or most of the rest of them. Religion being an infamously divisive subject however, I can certainly understand why a film like The Master would inspire such passionate differences of opinion. 9/10"
211,The Master,1,3 March 2013,Horrible Storyline,"I kept waiting for this movie to click. It just seemed to drift without making any sense. Can't believe they would invest 32 million dollars in such a goofy storyline. Two great actors cannot rescue this DUD! Some will probably enjoy the liberal use of full nudity. The acting was excellent. Both men and the leading lady played their roles to the hilt, but like most of the movie, very few scenes connected with the overall plot, if there really was a plot. The 1950's era was a great venue to show off old cars and attire. Even this could not pull the movie together. Amy Adams was superb and Joaquin Phoenix could have won an Oscar for his performance. I must say once again, NO PLOT NO CIGAR."
212,The Master,7,21 February 2013,Outshining protagonists,"+++ overwhelming acting! Joaquin phoenix again exorbitant good, Seymour Hoffman completely convincing and authentic. especially phoenix' passionated presentation of the role with all its physical (crooked back; lips) and mental flaws is deserving an Oscar. + Andersons unconventional style of directing, writing and filming! remarkable. +/- the story is interesting and shocking (scenes of sexual activity) but not that new and stunning. - the film set is most of the times a bit soft; should be even softer for a special contrast. + the music, like in There Will Be Blood, vanguard. I like that. For the future it would be clever to have a special eye on Paul Thomas Andersons work. He's one of the few directors and writers which still own an unmistakable style. His passion to details and unconventional stories always let you discover new stuff."
213,The Master,7,11 February 2013,Phoenix Returns... Like a Phoenix,"A Naval veteran (Joaquin Phoenix) arrives home from war unsettled and uncertain of his future -- until he is tantalized by The Cause and its charismatic leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman).As this film is nominated for three Academy Awards, all in the acting category, I would like to focus on those aspects and just not discuss plot or cinematography or even the Scientology parallels that are drawn in the film.Amy Adams gives a powerful performance, perhaps her best yet. She shows herself to be kind on one hand and a crafty manipulator on the other. While I have my reservations about Adams being cast as Dodd's wife (she seems much too young, although actually only seven years Hoffman's junior) this role showed a wide range of emotions that Adams was able to step into flawlessly. She may be worthy of the statuette.Philip Seymour Hoffman, on the other hand, is probably over-hyped. He is a fine actor, one of the best, and has done everything from ""Scent of a Woman"" to ""Big Lebowski"" to ""Moneyball"". His talent is obvious and inspiring. But this role, as Lancaster Dodd, was not among his best. A good role, certainly, but I never felt like he completely took on the mantle of the agitated, imaginative cult leader. He did not ""phone it in"", but he seems to have held back (or drank too much paint thinner).Now, Joaquin Phoenix is the man to watch. Maybe you thought he had gone away, either retired or was making lesser films like ""I'm Still Here"". But, here he is, back to the level he was at in ""Walk the Line"" and probably even beyond. He is believable as a drunk, his violent outbursts seemingly uncontrollable and random. This is an award-winning performance. His only problem: Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. Had this film been released in 2011 or 2013, Phoenix could know with confidence that this was his award... but will they pick him over Lincoln? I have my severe doubts."
214,The Master,9,10 February 2013,Masterclass,"Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is a sex obsessed alcoholic World War II veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder , struggling to fit into the post war society, becoming a drifter.One night, he stumbles drunk on a private yacht hosting a party. It belongs to Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a self styled ""Master"" of ""The Cause"". Dodd gets hooked to Freddie's liquor, allowing him to stay if he keeps making more. He subjects Freddie to a psychological exercise about his past (His father died of alcoholism, his mother is institutionalized and he has abandoned the love of his life, Doris, who he hasn't seen in seven years) Freddie is enthralled by Dodd, who is very firm on his abject beliefs and revelations regarding reincarnation & the subconscious. Dodd too takes a liking to Freddie, calling him his protégé and guinea pig. Freddie travels along the east coast with Dodd and his family ,which also includes Dodd's new pregnant wife Peggy (Amy Adams) , daughter Elizabeth and son Val as well as his son in law. Dodd is invited to the houses of many affluent women who have been attracted to the Cause, where he gives talks aiming to win more followers. Freddie's alcoholism & unpredictable behavior haven't subsided( going as far as beating up people questioning the Cause's methods and authenticity)making other members of the Cause feel that he does not belong there. Freddie's drinking continues inspite of him promising that he will quit.Val confides to Freddie that he thinks that his father is a fraud who just makes things as he goes along, causing Freddie to berate him. Dodd is arrested for practicing medicine without license. Freddie attacks the policemen who have come to arrest Dodd and gets jailed as well. In jail, Freddie goes berserk calling Dodd a fraud and questioning everything he has stood for. Both men trade insults and stop only when Dodd reminds that he is the only one who cares about him.After their release, Peggy and the rest of the followers become more vocal for expelling Freddie, branding him as a threat and a spy but Dodd declines. It become subtly clear that Dodd is merely using Freddie as a test subject , to prove that his methods can cure even a hopeless case like him. He aims to break Freddie down and rebuild him in the Cause's image.Freddie is subjected to repetitive and grueling tests for long periods which make him agitated due to their lack of results but Dodd declares him successful. Freddie has started becoming disillusioned of the Cause. Dodd's fraud is revealed to the viewer as he loses his temper with a follower (Laura Dern) when she states as per his latest book, he is actually causing his test subjects to ""imagine"" their past lives instead of ""experiencing"" them.During one of the exercises of the Cause in a desert, Freddie abandons them , deciding to leave the Cause forever. He visits Doris's house but is told that she is now married. Freddie is disappointed but happy for Doris.One night , Freddie has a vision of Dodd calling him. Taking this dream literally, he travels to meet him. Peggy tells Freddie that he either has to improve or leave, as he might become the undoing of the Cause itself. Dodd sadly realizes that his wife is right and tells Freddie that he has to find his own path in the world. He gives Freddie an ultimatum that he can either stay and devote his life to the Cause or leave never to return. Freddie chooses to leave. The ending shows him with a woman, remembering his happy days in the Navy. His fate is left ambiguous. Rootless, directionless, futureless aren't enough to describe Freddie Quell , played beautifully by Joaquin Phoenix . This is a person beyond redemption, a sad shadow of his former self , both the clothes and the skin that he lives in are ill fitting, whose speech is half incoherent and half irrelevant. This is a physically demanding role for which he had to lose weight considerably , to show an emaciated person blowing in the wind, whom alcohol is drinking up, a sad character , albeit wiser in the end. Philip Seymour Hoffman even in a cameo appearance can steal the show from the film's leads. Here, he is no different , playing the titular role of the film and its He brilliantly portrays Lancaster Dodd who is a charmer and at the same time, a charlatan, who even when proved wrong, staunchly promotes the snake oil he sells as an elixir, and he leaves no stone unturned to show a cold and a cunning person who while appearing to be magnanimous to Freddie, is merely using him as a lab animal for his experiments. Amy Adams is very effective as Peggy, a manipulative dedicated wife & driven follower of the Cause who goads her husband to keep answering bricks thrown at him with stones.Paul Thomas Anderson is one of those directors who never makes films for entertainment but for cinematic experience, thus making him both the critics dream and a nightmare. Lancaster Dodd and Freddie Quell appear as different as chalk and cheese, but deep down, both are in their own worlds, obsessed by their own products- Freddie by his liquor and Dodd by his abject and vague philosophy. In the end its Freddie who is proved wiser and braver than Dodd, because he chooses to leave something which has just made him a toy in someone else's hands He abandons a comfortable existence for a person like him for a scary and uncertain future, ending up right where he was at the start. Dodd remains a toy in the hands of his own convictions. Who is the Master that you serve? Your Lord? Your convictions? Your conscience? And can you identify the right master to serve?"
215,The Master,8,6 February 2013,Not for everyone,"I looked forward to this film not really knowing what to expect, but hey...it's an Anderson. I read a lot of reviews after seeing the movie and I understand why they go from 1 to 10. It's not an easy movie and therefor not for everyone. It was for me however...without a doubt. At the end of the movie I thought about what point I would give it and 8,5 was the first that came to mind, but felt that was too high. I give it an 8,2. The movie is filmed perfect and the acting is good. Not phenomenal, but good. The story is great given you watch the whole movie and don't' walk away (goes without saying...I know) and... and that's important...you get what it's about. Reading reviews opinions about what it's about differ, so just go see it and let the story lead you to your own conclusions. It's not a waste of time...far from it."
216,The Master,1,20 October 2012,Horrible!,"Didn't get the point at all. People walked out and I wanted to follow. I hoped that there might be some super ending that would make the torture I went through worth it. No such luck. What a waste of good talent. Sometimes even good acting isn't enough. Everyone kept waiting for something to happen but nothing did. Don't know how they found a studio to make this film. In the end it will probably win some award that will cause the curious to check it out. Oh well. I would summarize this movie in one word ""horrible"". Unfortunately, this site makes you write ten lines of stuff. I owe it to those who value their time and money to complete this post. I would want them to do the same for me."
217,The Master,1,10 May 2013,a complete and total waste of time,"Inane, stupid, idiotic, poorly written, poorly acted (yes, I believe so), a total waste of 144 minutes of ones' lifetime. Why was this movie even made? The characters don't grow, change, or have any real meaning. I hated all of the characters intensely. Anderson had talent early in his career but has completely lost his way. Boring! I can understand completely why this was a box-office dud - in movies, you need at least ONE character to care about and enjoy.I hated this awful movie - dreck! I'm offended by the critics who gave this such a high score. As usual, the critics are wrong!The camera work was highly praised, but I found the film was very flat for me. What is is with Philip Seymour Hoffman? He is one of a few actors who I really wish would leave the profession - they aren't interesting, have zero charisma, and the camera doesn't love them (Paul Giamatti is another actor who I feel this way about). Joaquin Phoenix came back to acting for this exercise in ego and futility? TERRIBLE acting performance! Sorry, I just HATED this movie, and I really did think I might like it - ""dianetics"" and ""scientology"" would be interesting topics for real movies, fiction or non-fiction."
218,The Master,10,24 February 2013,An unique masterpiece.,"I absolutely adore P.T Anderson's work, but I was surprised how much I loved this. I have seen now twice in theaters and once on Blu-Ray, and it gets better and more complex each time I watch it.Joaquin Phoenix plays the main character Freddy Quell. Sexually frustrated veteran, who just came back from the war. I'm gonna start by saying, if Joaquin doesn't win the Oscar for his performance, Oscars are worthless. No doubt, he gives the best performance of the year. Freddy is a lost soul, looking for answers and a direction in life. He's constantly nervous, confused and sexually active all the time. You could see how easily you can manipulate someone like him. Also I love he laughs a lot, it's that nervous laugh, but I still liked it. Also he's a drunk. And doesn't only drink alcohol, but really any chemicals, that will get you high. It's like his trying to be somebody he's not. He gets a lot of jobs, but always gets fired. He accidentally kills his co-worker and runs off. That's basically his whole life, running away from responsibility and troubles. The horrors of war haunt him as well, it's almost like he never left the war, emotionally. Also he has a tragic sexual memory and that is one reason for his confused sexuality. IMO, one of the best screen performances of all time really. That performance will haunt you, it's that good. It's truly an example of brilliant method acting, even Marlon Brando would be impressed be his performance.I know, I'm making it seem like Joaquin stole the shows, that not really true, because everybody else were fantastic as well. Like, Phillip Seymour Hoffman who plays Lancaster Dodd aka The Master. He's overly confident and has that pseudo-intellectual attitude. He's probably thinks he's better than somebody like Freddy and maybe that's why he took him as his protégé. Hoffman is excellent, but doesn't steal the show, neither does Phoenix, they work very well together. Their relationship works very well, it's realistic and kinda scary. The scene when they both get arrested is just a great example of their relationship, it feels like they really does have that student-master, but also a ""bro-mance"" going on. You could argue that there is gay undertones in it. They love each other, both for different reasons though, Freddy sees Dodd as a man who has the answers to his question aka a savior. Dodd loved Freddy because he's somebody he can control and manipulate, but also his friend. Something that Dodd doesn't have, a real friend, but also somebody who's easily controllable. Dodd, maybe crazy, but you believe in him, he really does a good job convincing. Example of that is the scene when a man comes to their party and starts questioning their logic. In another movie, Dodd would appear as helpless and couldn't defend his case and would be humiliated. But in this movie, Dodd appears a lot more intelligent than him, almost even convincing him. Yes, he gets really angry with the man and his ideas are complete bullsh*t, but he's a lot smarter and aggressive. Also Amy Adams is pretty perfect as well. A total manipulating and mean as hell, but you don't hate her. Most people say that this movie is about Scientology and cults like that. And if they want to throw some criticism with that, they say that PTA didn't handle the subject well enough. I will disagree that this movie is about cults, that is only the sub-theme of this movie. This is really about post-war world and the feel of it. But mostly about how are these veterans coming back from home, going to adjust in this world. That sort of lost feel, that melancholy confusion that it had. It's not a story about the Case (Dodd's cult), nor is it about any cult, it's a character piece, Freddy Quell's story. I think I have proof on that, PTA is on record saying the main influence to this movie was John Huston's documentary called Let There Be Light. Which is about WW2 veterans coming to home and adjusting to the post-war world. L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology were influences as well, but mainly on Lancaster Dodd character. Even though Hoffman said that he didn't base his performance on Hubbard.. And it's about manipulation and power. How Dodd manipulates Freddy and how Ms. Dodd manipulates Dodd himself. And it's about Freddy's and Lancaster's relationship as much as it's about the post-war world. Their relationship is very complicated, I already talked about that, so I won't say much. Dodd is an evil man, he tortures Freddy physically and mentally. The scene when Dodd starts asking Freddy questions on the boat is pure mental torture and later on, when he puts Freddy to the tests like touch the wall-touch the window thing, is physical. But Freddy stills stays, because he thinks Dodd gives some kind a direction in life, something meaningful. Even though in the end, he does realize how it wasn't meaningful.I have only one ""bad"" thing about this movie and that is the last 10-15 minutes. I think it should have ended in the desert. That would have been so epic and just beautiful. Speaking of beautiful, this is the most well shot movie of the (last) year. I don't understand how the cinematography wasn't even nominated. Also I love Johnny Greenwood's score, almost as good as in There Will Be Blood. No doubt the most intelligent and thought provoking movie of the year. Well, Joaquin didn't win, nor did Hoffman or Adams. Then again Joaquin was against Abraham Lincoln and giving an Oscar to a guy who played a drunk, instead of Lincoln is simply absurd (sarcasm btw). I love you D.D Lewis, but Joaquin was no doubt the best of the year. Loved it, 10/10"
219,The Master,9,2 January 2016,"""The Master"" demands time and sensitivity","""The Master"" was the first title in a long, long time that I felt compelled to watch more than once in a very short time. After watching it for the first time and reading some articles about the movie, I realized how much of the experience had slipped through my fingers and felt the urge to see it again, as soon as possible.The second viewing was essential to properly wrap my feelings about the movie. Although ""The Master"" is an American production, I feel that it resembles much more the cinema that is made from the other side of the Atlantic. In Europe, narrative in the movies has not the weight that it has in Hollywood. Here, cinema authors search more frequently for a sensory, poetic feeling in their works, preferring those over narrative coherence. Which is not necessarily better or worse than the American way, but certainly explains the coldness that the general audience displayed towards this movie.Although ""The Master"" has a story on it, it definitely doesn't play a major part in the film. Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't force any reaction from the viewer towards what's happening on screen. He's just displaying a story, and leaves just enough space between its elements so one can creep in and model the film has one likes: that's where the genius of ""The Master"" resides. It might take two or even three views before you realize what this movie might mean to you, so make sure you have the time to dedicate to this work. If you use to see more narrative-leaning Hollywood productions, you might find it hard to get used to ""The Master""'s tone. I recommend seeing some works by François Truffaut or Federico Fellini, e.g., to help you find the right mindset. In literature, you can also try Virginia Woolf."
220,The Master,7,18 March 2013,"Good, but neither entertaining nor rewarding.","The problem with The Master isn't that it's a bad movie; it's well crafted, has interesting scenes and dialogue, good acting, and is nice to look at it. But movies are best when they end up being greater than the sum of their parts, and when all the aforementioned elements flow together in a cohesive (and preferably entertaining) way. This movie doesn't quite achieve that, and I get the impression that it was never the intention of the director to do so. It seems PTA has set out to make a piece of art. Did he accomplish that goal? He does, in the sense that the film is multifaceted, challenging, and full of subtle (and not so subtle) ideas and metaphors. What the film is lacking is dramatic tension. There should be lots of it here...primarily between Freddie Quill and Lancaster Dodd. There are bits and pieces sprinkled throughout, but the type of relationship being explored (between 'slave' and 'master') is such an odd one, that it never really gets defined and we never really know what to make of it. Even the arc of Freddie no longer needing the master leaves us with an uneasy feeling, as nothing is resolved, because in the end the character remains largely unchanged. Maybe that was the whole point of the film; to expose what a fraud that the master was. Or maybe the point was that the Freddie reminded Dodd of who he would have liked to be. Or maybe there's a deeper philosophical message about never being able to change the ""proverbial"" animal that man is, not matter how much dogma you build up around him. But therein lies the problem; there is no implicit point to this film. There is no real narrative. With a movie like this, you are left to draw your own conclusions. That's fine, and not all movies have to be entertaining fluff, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that this would have been a much more interesting movie if PTA had gone the ""Citizen Kane"" route and made the whole thing a character study about Lancaster Dodd. Maybe he was just too burnt-out after having made one of the best character-study movies ever (There Will Be Blood.) Is it worth watching? Yeah. Is it something you are going to fall in love with and feel like watching more than once? Probably not."

223,The Master,4,22 September 2012,Can I watch a prequel somewhere? WTF? = After movie buzz.,"The theater was almost filled to capacity. When it emptied, the overwhelming audience reaction was, ""What was that??"" Seems no one ""got"" this movie. Including myself and my big time film fan wife. Shouldn't a movie be a self-contained story? Or at least give one choices within the film? I heard several others say that they'd have to go home an look up what the movie was supposed to be about. Others rushed to the posted reviews to see what they said about it and still others grabbed a copy of the local entertainment pulp to read up on the movie. People wanted to like it, but as one gentleman said to his companion's laughter, ""Lucky they didn't come. They would've killed me!""Perhaps my wife's take is correct, "" I think you have to be 'in the know' before you come to this movie."" In other words, if you have some basis of knowing the Scientology story, perhaps this movie reflects a beginning point.The movie seems incomplete in allot of ways. Although the acting was well done and at times incredibly intense, (why I rated it 4 stars) the characters' story lines were thin indeed. We are never really given a true glimpse of how each of the main characters got to where this movie places them. Not one character earned my sympathy or disdain. Who are these people really? Don't know. Don't care!"
224,The Master,10,22 September 2012,A Modern Masterpiece from Paul Thomas Anderson,"Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master is far and away the most perfectly executed film of the year. The film follows Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a World War II veteran struggling to find his place and purpose in post-war America. He comes upon Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the leader of a new religion known as 'The Cause,' who, along with Dodd's wife (Amy Adams), take Freddie under their wings and try to heal him. The film focuses almost exclusively on the relationship between Freddie and Lancaster, aided in no small part by two tour de force performances from Phoenix and Hoffman, both of who look like early frontrunners in their respective Oscar categories. While 'The Cause' is clearly inspired by Scientology, The Master is not at all about Scientology, the same way There Will Be Blood is not about oil and Boogie Nights is not really about the porn industry. This film is about the relationship between Freddie and Lancaster, and is truly one of the great character studies ever committed to screen.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is the best of the year, and arguably the best screen performance since Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood, also, not coincidently, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Phoenix transforms himself without altering his appearance or voice, he just becomes Freddie in a way that hearkens back to DeNiro's Travis Bickle or Nicholson's R.P. McMurphy. Freddie is an animal, a lost human at his absolute lowest, and Phoenix pulls this off with such honesty and commitment that you would think Freddie Quell is a real, living person who's life you are watching unfold in a pseudo-documentary. There are two specific scenes involving Phoenix (one involving an audit, one involving a jail cell) I would be comfortable putting up against any other acting performance in any other film, he's that good. There comes a point in the film where he is no longer acting, he is inhabiting his character and the world he lives in so effortlessly it's almost frightening.Phillip Seymour Hoffman also turns in arguably his career best performance, possibly only surpassed by his turn as Truman Capote, as the religious leader Lancaster Dodd. Hoffman adds layer upon layer to a character that on the surface seems quite obvious, but is, in his own way, just as complicated of a character as Freddie. Amy Adams does an excellent job in a smaller role, there's not doubt that her character takes a backseat to Freddie and Lancaster, but she is as good as she's ever been in her interactions with Lancaster.The cinematography is as good as you'd expect in a PTA film, two tracking shots in particular, towards the film's beginning, are standouts. PTA has a signature style of not making a cut unless there's a reason to cut, an incredibly refreshing approach to filmmaking, reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick, and in a summer of hand-held fast cut action sequences, this more mature, focused approach is a welcome relief. Jonny Greenwood once again provides the score here, and while the soundtrack does not have quite as many memorable pieces as There Will Be Blood, it provides the perfect level of ambiance and frantic tension the film requires.It goes without saying that The Master will be a major Oscar contender this winter, with almost guaranteed nominations in all the major categories and likely wins for Best Actor (Phoenix), Best Supporting Actor (Hoffman), Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. Even if the film doesn't win Best Picture (it may be a bit too risky of a pick for the Academy's bland and watered down palate), Paul Thomas Anderson has a very good chance at picking up the trophy for Best Director, as if nothing else The Master is the perfect example of a world class filmmaker perfectly executing his vision. While the film is almost flawless, it is not for everyone. The Master is the rare modern film that continues to challenge and respect its audience's intelligence. You have to work with the film, fill in the blanks yourself, and commit the same desire to discover that the filmmakers did. It's not an easy watch, it won't give you all the answers you want, and truthfully is quite cold in its final statements, but if you go in with a desire to think and be challenged, to unlock and discover, you won't be disappointed. 9.5/10"
225,The Master,8,22 September 2012,"Not an Expose, But Very Worthwhile Nevertheless","I walked =into= the theater expecting a purposeful, if cautious (considering...) send-up of Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, and another Oscar nomination for PSH. I walked =out= of the theater having seen the most accurate on-screen portrayal I have seen thus far of combat post-traumatic stress disorder and an Oscar nomination for JP.This is not to say that Hoffman wasn't up to his usual snuff (he was), but Phoenix =nailed= a version of PTSD ""greatest generation"" style with all the nuances one sees around any VA Medical Center: confusion, pseudo-bravado, compensatory & malignant narcissism, antisocial tendencies (right on the verge of sociopathy), sadomasochism, serious trust / autonomy / initiative / competence / identity issues (see Erik Erikson), and the stunted earlier development we see in so many whose emotional house of cards finally caves in after repeated exposure to real, sustained violence. We're not talking Van Johnson's, John Wayne's, Richard Widmark's or Humphrey Bogart's late '40s versions of ""war weariness."" We're talking ""real-deal shattered capacity to deal with life as it is."" Alcoholism, sudden explosive violence, sex addiction, hair-trigger irritability, paranoid ideation, utter interpersonal incompetence; precisely the sort of stuff we have all seen recently in veterans who are also mass murder suspects. Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's military career records indicate that Hubbard himself might have been an ""excellent candidate"" for PTSD had he served in front-line combat roles (he did not). I've no idea whether or not he had the sort of interest in trying to cure returning vets of their ""combat fatigue"" or ""shell shock,"" but that =is= suggested in the film.The other theme that strikes me as valuable about The Master is its very clear-lensed look into the early development of one of several first-generation human potential cults germinating at the time. The dynamics (including those displayed by ""the master's"" wife and daughter) reminded me of what I saw around Esalen in the 1960s and as a fly on the wall with former Ayn Rand lover Nathaniel Branden's group in the 1970s: People stumbling in the dark really seeking enlightenment and ""walking self-revelatory planks"" baring their most shame-soaked secrets to mere mortals who might or might not be truly trustworthy in the long run. What I sense that I saw -- if the film is reasonably accurate -- was Scientology (or =whatever=) in the formative years well before Hubbard himself began to become a victim of his own (considerable) limitations. And certainly before David Miscavige took the helm of the aging Hubbard's ship in the early 1980s. My sense, based on several face-to- face interviews with former Scientologists over the years is that the early days were indeed far more idealistic, sincere and well-intended than what Scientology began to morph into in the past 20 years or so. Viewers looking for an expose will not find one here. But what they will see is a group of human beings in the first decade of making a religion out of something that was equal parts neo-Freudian, Jungian and Adlerian psychotherapies... and the tenuous ""spirituality"" of the authoritarian personality cult."
226,The Master,6,21 September 2012,Amazing but fizzled,"All of the performances were outstanding. Both lead actors deserve Oscar nominations. The film was engaging from start to finished, visually. SPOILER ALERTBUT, why was Lacaster so interested in Freddie? I just didn't see the appeal. I really appreciated the unique unpredictable storytelling, but it where did the story go? I see that the the Cause became very successful but why did Lancaster invest so much time in Freddie? I felt like the story needed further development and Anderson just scratched the surface. Lancaster failed with Freddie. Why did we need to see this? I don't see how Freddie contributed to Lancaster's life or profession. It could've been an amazing classic film but the script needed further development."
227,The Master,1,29 May 2013,Worst movie I've ever seen,"The acting is phenomenal. The story is terrible. There is no direction. It goes on for 2 and a half hours. Basically there is one notable scene where the main character's nonsense is challenged by a more rational scientific man. This is about 6 minutes long and its the ONLY point you will find in this movie. There is no reason to make a 2.5 hour long film when a 6 minute scene sums up the entire film. Why make us wait so long for 6 minutes of content?The rest of the film goes no where. Its a disaster. The acting is so great, but the pacing and story is just BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRING.PTA really sucked the whale's balls on this one. Its as if the man cant edit a film, or he knew he had nothing so he just filmed great actors doing essentially nothing, extremely well.... and let the audience suffer for it."
228,The Master,7,25 April 2013,Amy Adams and Joaquin Phoenix were phenomenal!,"Amy Adams was a powerhouse in this movie and Joaquin Phoenix was just beyond amazing. If it was up to me, I would have given the Oscar to Joaquin, because even though I loved Daniel Day-Lewis in the movie Lincoln, Joaquin had a more powerful complex role. Amy Adams basically played a modern Lady Macbeth. She did not have many lines, but you were always aware of her presence. It's like even though she wasn't the center of attention, you knew that she was there. Listening and reacting so beautifully. I just adored Amy Adam's performance. I just know you will love Joaquin Phoenix. Especially the scenes he is in with Philip Seymour Hoffman. Overall, I loved this movie and I'm sure you will love it too."
229,The Master,10,3 March 2013,'Your fear of capture and imprisonment is from millions of years ago. You are not there. You are asleep.',"Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson is best known for his works 'There Will Be Blood', 'Punch-Drunk Love ', 'Magnolia' and 'Boogie Nights'. His films often depict the suburban U.S. as a place of alienation, and his characters are often alienated people who must in some way or another learn to assimilate themselves into some kind of family environment. Anderson has certainly proved himself to be a director of formidable skill and power, but has not yet reached a particularly wide audience. THE MASTER has polarized audiences and will probably continue to do so until he manages to produce another mind-bending film the equal of his past successes.The film asks much from the audience: the script is at times confusing and the jumps in time make the film disconnect. But then that is precisely the kind of world that is being described in this story about a cult leader who has 'figured out' how we come to behave and respond the way we do - that it may be traumas or events in our past lives that are finally playing out in order to be purged.Returning from Navy service in World War II, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) drifts through a series of PTSD-driven breakdowns, alcoholism, uncontrollable rage, and is totally lacking in the ability to make consistent sense of the world he faces. Finally he stumbles upon a cult that engages in exercises to clear emotions and he becomes deeply involved with them. The Cause is lead by Master Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who works with his wife Peggy (Amy Adams) and his children Val (Jesse Plemons) who refuses to participate in his father's exercises because 'he's making it up as he goes', Elizabeth (Ambyr Childers) and Elizabeth's new husband Clark (Rami Malek). Freddie first meets this strange group aboard a yacht where, being drunk, he has passed out. Freddie is a bruised soul - not only from his experience in the war, but also because of an abusive childhood (his mother is severely psychiatrically damaged and is hospitalized) and a disrupted ability to form relationships with both women and men. Master takes him in, works with him almost as a laboratory animal, and the Cause hits snags in various locations (in Philadelphia they are hosted by the wealthy Helen Sullivan played by Laura Dern), with moments that border on psychotic taste and credibility. There is no true resolution to the encounters between Freddie and Master except at film's end when the Master tells Freddie, 'If you figure a way to live without serving a master, any master, then let the rest of us know, will you? For you'd be the first person in the history of the world.'THE MASTER disturbs but it makes us consider the concept of mind manipulation by cult leaders while at the same time opening the possibility to consider time travel, metaphysics, and spiritualism. The three leads - Phoenix, Hoffman and Adams - are exceptionally fine, and the huge supporting cast is ably manipulated by Anderson to achieve the mind-bending effects he desires. The musical score is compelling as assembled by Radiohead member Johnny Greenwood, a highly regarded composer who has collaborated with Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki in the past, and the very strange cinematography (a characteristic of Anderson's films) is in the hands of Mihai Malaimare Jr. THE MASTER will not appeal to everyone, but it is an experimental film that takes many risks and succeeds in proving its point of view.

230,The Master,1,21 February 2013,"Not bad, not good, just whatever.","I must admit the acting was excellent ( Philip Seymour Hoffman, Joaquin Phoenix even better then Phillip) but the script was not that great. There s been some utterly unnecessary scenes and lots of flaws, the storyline was not very comprehensible (although i might have been getting drowsy from the movie..) and it was getting really dull at some points. And the most of all it did not get to me emotionally. I think a movie should have some emotional impact on its viewer. I gave it only 1/10 mainly because i was expecting much more from author like Paul Thomas Anderson and i felt kind of robbed. Well judge for yourselves. Thank you."
231,The Master,8,2 October 2012,We spend over two excruciatingly long hours with these two guys for no real quality payoff!,"'THE MASTER': Four Stars (Out of Five) Director Paul Thomas Anderson's critique on Scientology and the effects it has on it's followers, most specifically (in this story) a World War II drifter. Joaquin Phoenix stars as the military veteran and Philip Seymour Hoffman co-stars as the L. Ron Hubbard inspired cult leader. It co-stars Amy Adams and was written and directed by Anderson. The movie is technically stunning and beautiful to look at but as a whole is very emotionally void and unfulfilling.Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a Naval veteran of World War II who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism. Freddie fails to adjust to life at multiple jobs and becomes a drunk drifter who one day passes out on the yacht of a cult leader named Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman). Dodd likes the home-made alcoholic drink Freddie has on him so much that he invites him to stay and attend the wedding of his daughter (Ambyr Childers). Quell is soon caught up in the life of Dodd and his family and is mesmerized by his teachings, which are intended to clear the emotions through a form of psychological questioning called Processing. Freddie soon becomes Lancaster's favorite project as the rest of the Dodd family and cult reject him, seeing that the religion has no real effect on him or the demons inside him.The movie is extremely slow paced and lacks any real direction or story structure. It does develop it's two lead characters well but neither are relatable or likable people, especially Freddie who seems more insane than anything else. If the film had focused more on the religion itself and the motivation and inspiration behind it it could have been a lot more fascinating and involving. Anderson's directing and the cinematography are once again beautiful and the performances are topnotch but the characters aren't layered enough (at least not on a revealing level) to really make the movie worthwhile. We spend over two excruciatingly long hours with these two guys for no real quality payoff. Still the film is beautiful to look at and the premise and characters at first glance are very intriguing. The film just goes nowhere with it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj0JA1sJBzw"
232,The Master,5,30 July 2014,Disappointment,"Having seen movies by Paul Thomas Anderson such as Hard Eight, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, it is hard to believe that such a good writer/director made such a film. Anderson is not only the director of his movies, he is also in charge of the script. So it is hard for me to believe that he wrote such a flawed screenplay for The Master.According to my opinion the screenplay failed to adequately explain the exact ideas of Lancaster Dodd, why these ideas were so special and why they exerted so much influence on Dodd's followers. On the other hand acting was exceptional by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix but that was not enough. If the screenplay was solid and not based on sparse lines and ideas, together with the great acting this would end up in a very good drama.I'm sorry Mr. Anderson but this time it didn't work. I am really looking forward for your next good strong drama!"
233,The Master,8,28 March 2013,Let it wash over you.....,"The direction of this film is mesmeric in its simplicity. It is very difficult to resist its like trying to listen to music played at at level loud enough to be heard but not immediately recognised and you find yourself being seduced but no one bought you dinner.Mr Anderson creates a very organic feeling to the film. We as viewers are like a sheet of paper that has been blown and landed in these peoples lives and at any moment the wind will pick up again.Tackling a theme like this a lesser director would normally jump on to a soap box and bang a drum telling as how to feel about the characters. Mr Anderson lets the story unfold and trusts the audience to absorb The acting is first rate and the lead actors bring real depth to the characters. A special mention for Amy Adams who has truly developed into a true exponent of the craft.One very small gripe; Mr Phoenix's vocal affectation may have been overused..in the same way Dustin Hoffman always had a ""Dumbo's feather"" in search of Oscar glory.Overall, I highly recommend this film....give in....you'll feel better."
234,The Master,9,8 March 2013,One of the best films in recent years,"Paul Thomas Anderson delivers as always. Maybe not of the same caliber as There Will Be Blood but still truly captivating non the less. The plot is fantastic and as rich as the characters, definitely a brilliant screenplay and probably the best of the year. The acting is sublime, Phoenix and Hoffman have brilliant chemistry. This story brilliantly showcases the struggles of life in post war America, it highlights the effects war and society can have on people. Freddie Quell is a man conflicted, a social outcast who journeys through this film trying to find a place to fit in. He is then found by the master and his entourage, whom he idolizes, but their relationship and quest is complex."
235,The Master,2,5 March 2013,Not what I expected,"As soon as I saw Joaquin Phoenix humping the beach I knew I was in for a long haul. The movie was a total letdown. After reading what a good film this was my wife and I watched it. She more than I wanted to see it. Well, for a Sunday night rental it was only good enough to put us to sleep. This movie was boring from start to finish. The musical score seemed like it could be used for a Psycho movie remake. The movie appeared to focus more on the character Joaquin Phoenix played than Philip Seymour Hoffman's. Amy Adams jacking off PSH into the bathroom sink really didn't need to be in the film. I thought she played her character well though. The movie, however, just weaves in and out and really made no sense. I got to learn how to make hooch using paint thinner..lol...this was an absolute sleeper. Joaquin Phoenix played his part well as a violent alcoholic but then that part has been played so many times. The best I could give this is a 2. I honestly didn't think there would be this many good reviews here."
236,The Master,6,3 March 2013,"Didn't live up to There Will be Blood, but it's still worth a look.","Set in post World War II America, Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master sees Joaquin Phoenix play a mentally unstable and shell shocked ex sailor caught up in an organisation led by the charismatic Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The Master is the follow up to Anderson's incredibly successful There Will Be Blood starring Daniel Day Lewis, but unlike the 2007 hit, The Master just falls short of being appealing to both critics and the wider audience. The opening scenes give the audience a sense of who our main character is, Freddie (Phoenix) is a young man struggling with the on-going war and his fragile state of mind. He has a serious drinking problem, he is violent and he appears to be sexually deviant, all of this results in his discharge from service, it is from here that we see Freddie struggle to reintegrate back into normal society. He bounces from one menial job to another and gets through each day by drinking nasty concoctions of paint thinner, bleach and anything else he can get his hands on to make his infamous ""hooch"". After a few years of running from his mistakes, Freddie finds himself hiding on the boat of Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman). Also known as the Master, Dodd is the charismatic leader of a small but devote group of followers of the Cause. Freddie's lack of guidance or stability in his life makes him the perfect project for Dodd, who welcomes him into the Cause. One scene early in the film sees Dodd preform what he calls ""processing"" on Freddie; this involves breaking Freddie down and forcing him to tell his most shameful and private thoughts and experiences. This scene is long and difficult to watch at times but was surely instrumental in getting Phoenix and Hoffman an Oscar nomination each.As the story develops we see Freddie and Dodd form a strong bond that often results in Freddie acting out in defence of The Cause and it's Master. The leading men are both excellent in their roles, but it is clear that it wasn't much of a stretch for either of them; Hoffman resurrects his character from Doubt in many scenes and Phoenix plays the troubled younger man that we've seen in many of his older works like To Die For and Parenthood. Amy Adams however does a fantastic job playing the loyal wife to The Master, from the get go we see that she is a devout follower of his teachings in the public sphere, but behind closed doors things are very different, Peggy (Adams) is in control, this is brilliantly shown in an incredibly awkward bathroom scene between the two.The view of cult groups in this film is very interesting at times, but often falls short of being a truly compelling insight into cult teachings. Dodd is often confused and uncertain throughout the film of what he wants the Cause to be, this makes is difficult to believe people would follow him so blindly. It also appears that Anderson wanted to draw parallels between The Cause and Scientology, both religions have similar beliefs and inauguration processes, and Dodd's character is clearly a parody of L. Ron Hubbard, but the similarities are too few to make the film a satire on Scientology but still too much to make the Cause an organisation all its own.Overall, The Master is a well-crafted film; it is perfectly cast and is shot beautifully, it does however lack direction at times and fails to deliver the satisfying ending it deserves."
237,The Master,7,19 February 2013,Not quite a masterpiece,"The Master tells a simple story and is a simplistic film. The story follows Freddie (Joaquin Phoenix) a WWII veteran and his troubled life after the war. Freddie eventually stumbles across the path of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) - The self proclaimed Master of a teaching or a cult.The film examines how Freddie reacts to and is eventually swallowed by the cult. The Master lacks narrative, and structure but not in a bad way. Paul Thomas Anderson (writer and director) has actually used the lack of narrative and structure almost as characters in the film. The film is presented almost as if it were a documentary, and this is I believe it's key strength. If you are looking for an action packed film exploring a cult, then this may not be for you. But if you enjoy character development over plot driven films then The Master is well worth a look."
238,The Master,10,29 September 2012,Paths of a 2001 Clockwork Master,"After reading a grip disenchanted reviews, I feel that the majority of the negativity is do to the fact of not getting the picture. So I will break it down for you and again this what I got from the picture, it's not like PT and I had tea and crumpets this morning! OK... Phoenix's character represents man, an ape like man, like 2001, that needs a soulful direction. PSH's character is the religion and the idea of soulful direction. The picture plays out like the Shakespearean bible so to speak, but in the vulgar, clever, brilliant mind and eye of PT Anderson. Lost savage meets soulful yet deviant leader,empty promises of faith and direction, ""god"" gets a hand job and straightens up. More empty promises, just like the foundation of a lot of religions and the savage just need to have sex to feel level. But obviously a lot more specific."
239,The Master,10,21 September 2012,The Masterpiece That Is The Master,"The movie being reviewed is ""The Master"" written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. The worldwide release date was September 21, 2012.I'd like to start this out by saying this film is without-a- doubt filled with the best acting performances I have seen so far this year. The character Freddy Quell is portrayed by actor Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix has been on a hiatus from acting for about 4 years and now and has returned with one of, if not his best, performance. Freddy Quell is a United States Navy veteran who has returned home after winning World War II and trying to adapt back into society and ends up getting sucked into a religious cult. Early on in the film we notice that Freddy is not particularly ""normal"" and there is definitely something wrong with him. Phoenix is able to capture the audience and make them full aware of this by the way he moves, speaks, his facial expressions, and his overall personality. Phoenix truly becomes a 1950s war veteran in The Master and with his astonishing acting you are able to understand the character Freddy and come up with some conclusions about the type of person he is. Another great acting performance is that of Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd, an intelligent, egotistical, and semi-psychotic leader. We as the audience know and believe Lancaster has all of these traits not just because of the script, but because of how Hoffman presents himself as Lancaster. He takes on this role and shows to the audience the type of man Lancaster was set to be and we believe it. Lastly, Lancaster's wife, Peggy, is Amy Adams. Peggy is a clear and obvious example of Lancaster's work of bringing people into his teachings. Amy Adams shows us how dear Peggy finds the teachings and how much she respects and believes them. I am a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson (PTA) and was extremely excited to finally see a movie of his in theaters. I consider PTA to have a very unique and interesting way of directing and writing which is very consistent and enticing in all of his works. He likes the use of music, and what is great is the music is always very different from what you normally hear in movies, it has no lyrics, it gets very loud at parts, and it puts a somewhat of a weird feel over the scene. I say weird because at times the music seems like it doesn't fit with what is going on, but it still feels like it does somehow fit. I was considerably happy and joyed with the way PTA worked with The Master and it was superb. After There Will Be Blood and now The Master, I cannot wait to see what is next in store with Paul Thomas Anderson.Before I had seen the film, I had a basic understanding of what the film's story was going to be about. Even going in with this information, you still feel as if you don't know what is going to happen. I see this storyline as very original and very intriguing. You have two men, both with obvious and apparent borderline psychotic conditions, and when clashed together make an even more psychotic atmosphere. The Master, who is Lancaster Dodd, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is a religious cult-like leader who has been drawn to this weak and troubled man, Freddy Quell, played by Joaquin Phoenix, and has put his hooks into him. We learn how this group has been building from quite sometime now and has a somewhat large following. We learn how this group functions and what it's beliefs are. The greatest part is the irony in this film. The people of ""The Cause"" as it is called, see everyone in the world who don't follow them or operate as they do, as the insane ones. I can safely say that every character's sanity could be called into question after watching this film. There are movies that entertain you, and there are movies that amaze you with its artistic magic. Movies that entertain you can pull you in with excitement but at sometimes when it dies down, you lose the feeling of being ""lost"" in the film, forgetting the fact you are watching a movie. Movies that amaze you with artistic magic, keep you watching and you can't turn your head away, you feel as if you are witnessing reality and are in the room with the actors. With The Master, both of these traits are brought to the audience with perfect execution. A combination of cinematography, directing, acting, and storyline all play a part in what I call the ""Lost-In-Movie"" factor, and The Master hits the nail on the head.To end, I just want to say I went into this film thinking it was going to be great, but didn't expect to be entertained as much as I was. The Master surely superseded my expectations. Acting - 20/20 Directing - 20/20 Cinematography - 20/20 Storlyine- 20/20 Limited Mistakes - 5/5 Lost Factor - 5/5 Oscar Potential - 8/10 (Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor/Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Movie)"
240,The Master,4,23 February 2013,Sacrifice to finish!,"I really liked some other movies from Paul Thomas Anderson but following the opinions from other IMDb users, I went to see the movie without knowing the story. What a pain! Joaquim Phoenix is really great, like Philip Seymour Hoffman, but in a minor film.The story is so confused and without rhythm that I just looked to the watch hoping it to be finished.I hope Joaquim Phoenix does not get the Oscar because lots of people will try to see the movie because of that. And they will lose more than two hours of their lives with a very boring movie. Nevertheless he deserves the Oscar. If not for that, I would give this movie a 3."
241,The Master,,5 February 2013,"boring, vague and weird without any purpose","when i watched this movie started to roll, the first thought came into my mind was how could an almost deformed person like hunchback of Notredame could possibly enlisted in the u.s. navy? the guy was a stooped, one deformed shoulder sagged in with irregular ribs, he couldn't even stand vertically straight, how he could pass the tough training for the grunts? and his mental condition was also obviously totally shattered and been abnormal long before he was enlisted by the navy. he might have already been a weirdo since teenage or even earlier. so how come and how a guy in such a messy condition could be a soldier fighting the 2nd world war? this was obviously a wrong cast signing this great actor to play such weird character in a even weirder movie. then again, the guy was such crazy psychopath to work in a department too. then again, after the crazy uncontrollable incident, the guy got a labor job in the field, then again, the arrangement of the scene became even weirder, his co-workers were from where? those people around him spoke a dialect vaguely like Filipinos, but right after WWII, even the Mexican immigrants were rare if you had seen many other movies with that era as the time zone, there's no way those labors could be from the far east. then, there're plenty of naked butts all over the place, yet none of them would have turned any normal males on. guess when females in those ugly forms affected by gravity and ages, wearing or not wearing made no big difference. if you want to see beautiful bodies, strongly recommend ""Spartacus season 1~3). then, the doctor vs patient, asking and answering the questions of the meanings on those cards, here, double 0 7 already responded with the same answers in his ""skyfall(another cliché-to-death boring movie)"" adventure. why answering those cards could get the libidos or taboos to verify a person's normality is beyond me. when you kept watching this film, in order not to walk out, the only factor that kept you in the theater was: ""what's going on?"" or ""what the....?!""the whole movie is such a weird, vague, pointless and purposeless mix-up that simply could not saved by two great actors albeit a wrong casting job, horrible and hollow screenplay, a different shooting camera. the whole movie was just like a sculpture created by a guy only he knew what he's doing. like this cult genre movie, the writer/director got a lot of blind followers who adored him no matter what or from the other angle, he was like a brat blindly adored and spoiled by his rich folks no matter what. but to me, this movie is just a messy non-direction creation that only affected me with a huge yawn."
242,The Master,10,12 January 2013,The Master,"I'm sorry this review is so late; however, I just saw a screening of ""The Master,"" in Los Angeles, and was so compelled, so spellbound, that I felt not posting my review would somehow be a wrongdoing on my part. I am throughly convinced that Paul Thomas Anderson is the greatest living filmmaker, bested only perhaps by Martin Scorsese, despite the fact that Anderson writes his films as well, while Scorsese only directs the scripts of others. Each time I see one of Anderson's films for the first time, it's like a sort of surreal nirvana, and I leave the theater in silence, contemplating the artistic genius of everything I've just watched. Some will say the storyline of ""The Master"" seems basic, and told in an overly convoluted way; however, any true movie-hound knows Anderson doesn't care about what's happening on the surface of his films. That's why he ends ""Magnolia"" in a storm of frogs raining from the sky. It's all about the symbolism, and ""The Master"" is filled with fascinating meanings and subtle truth, that when looked for, hit you like a bullet train. Joaquin Phoenix plays a drifter named Freddie, lost and damaged after a naval tour for World War II. After his return, he finds himself constantly drunk and not only unable to hold down a job, but unable to even keep a simple conversation with someone. When he stumbles across the charismatic leader of The Cause, played fearlessly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, he becomes tantalized by this man who calls himself the Master, and his strange, yet entrancing set of beliefs and theories. The Master also takes up an odd fixation with Freddie, that seems to have deep-seated motives. Anderson is crafty in the way he develops his characters, because while Freddie seems drunk and unstable and The Master seems elegant and well-mannered, Freddie is the better of the two people, because he only seeks general acceptance and love, while The Master thrives on manipulating and brainwashing those around him for his own personal gain. Amy Adams also delivers an Oscar-worthy supporting performance, as The Master's wife, Peggy Dodd, who is blindly faithful to him and completely absorbed in The Cause.As expected, the technical aspects of ""The Master"" are also fantastic. It is shot on 65mm film that displays a striking and captivating image, making it also one of the most visually magnificent films of the year as well. The cinematography is utterly enchanting. Like we've seen through his previous films, Anderson orchestrates his cameras so they are almost always moving, and allowing us to experience his spectacle from differing viewpoints. Overall, ""The Master"" is a breathtaking and spellbinding accomplishment in acting, writing, directing, editing, cinematography, and score. It shouldn't receive any less than ten Oscar nods; even only nine would be an injustice. Additionally, though I have yet to see the last three contenders, ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" ""Django Unchained,"" and ""Lés Miserables,"" I can confidently say that ""The Master"" is the best picture of the year."
243,The Master,10,7 October 2012,Some preliminary associations about The Master,"apologia: I can only go by what I remember from first viewingWater. Principle of all life. Ocean, oceanic, the cosmos. A helmeted soldier, soldiers head out on a mission. Soldiers on a beach. The beach, the shore, birthplace of all life. Men contorting and wriggling around together, like the pictures we've seen of sperm. One's trying to penetrate and fertilize a female figure - impossible, just grains of sand. (""Cowgirl in the Sand"" when Neil Young was delirious with fever) Can only spill his seed in the ocean.He can't be in this world (as he's later told) unless he's drunk, intoxicated, even if it could kill him, like poison. Can't function in ""civilization,"" a job, a department store. The woman there is not much beyond sand through his fingers, she's a mannequin. He's trying to see a man, a stocky ""powerful"" man, prefiguring The Master. But he can't get the Light right, and so they clash, they must clash.Harvesting produce in a valley (Salinas) - where have we seen that before? East of Eden. Cal, another Caliban, an evil sprite? James Dean also made some wildly contorted faces. Wanted a Father's guidance but was possessed by need for a Mother.Freddy gets a Father figure, who admits a shared need for intoxication, but who wants to transform him to be a creature who can survive in the ""civilized"" world. The ""slow boat"" they're on is to take them to the ""other side,"" the East Coast, through a canal. Perilous journey.Primal memories, especially about an idealized girlfriend. ""Mother"" is actually in a ""looney bin."" Doris in one image is separated from him by a window screen, which he needs to tear aside. Later, in The Master's ""application"" Freddy must blindly imagine his encounters with surfaces, barriers. Is ""breaking on through to the other side"" (Jim Morrison also died of his personal demons and intoxication)as impossible as walking though a solid wall? Or is it as simple as imagining the other side of fragile glass? (In Bergman's Persona, a boy attempts to touch through a transparent barrier to the image of a Mother.)Freddy is no more able to be ""processed"" by the domination of The Master than he is willing to abandon his drunken urge for regression and fusion with the Mother as commanded by The Master's wife.Eventually, as ""Book Two"" is published (a New Testament? not just The Father, but now Father & Son, a split of the Father Principle?) Freddy is struck by the revelation that now ""imagination,"" not memory, is the Secret.Out on the desert, the place for visions. To ride a motorbike as off on a vision quest. Freddy aims for ""that rock, that mountain."" Only Buckaroo Banzai could rocket into a stone cliff and break through to another dimension. Lawrence of Arabia tried to mythologize himself into a new world and found his final fate on such a ride. The Easy Rider deluded himself that he could ride his bike to a New America.Here's the Big Stretch: that all we see past Freddy's fade into heat shimmers on the horizon is his ""imagining"" through to the other side. He ""imagines"" he revisits Doris's home and accepts that now she is ""Doris Day,"" an idealized woman of fantasy. He ""imagines"" sexual union with a woman, though only as if an exercise of The Master. Finally he is back on the primal shore, ""imagining"" tranquility at the breast.The Master intones his wish - if only the two of them could be sufficient for each other, on a ""slow boat to China."" But that's impossible, because Freddy will always be searching for reunion with his Mother.The Water again, the ocean. As cosmic and primal as the blank white movie theater screen before which we all love to sit where he we try to visualize our imagined longings.(I think there are many other deliberate or subconscious references to to other films in The Master. Citizen Kane, of course. The Thin Red Line. And even The Long Goodbye. If you respond to my associations, please add your own.)"
244,The Master,10,30 September 2012,Learning is always a good experience!,"It won't be a long review. I just wanted to add my few cents. After I finished watching the movie I knew who was the Master in this movie. Indeed, the most challenging figure in this movie - Freddie. He is truly the Master for all involved in this story. After few days, it came to my mind again and I thought about myself. How many times in my life have I been a Master to somebody? I think many times. We are Masters for someone at least once in our current life time. I believe it is valuable part of our life and I appreciate that this movie highlights this. The actors' play was incredible and provocative. I recommend to see it for yourself and think about your life experience. Do you think you are Master?"
245,The Master,7,29 September 2012,"All the hype, for what?","Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best modern American filmmakers around. His new film entitled ""The Master"", loosely based on Scientology, examines the relationship between the alluring leader of a group called The Cause and a troubled ex-Navy seaman. Anderson is known for his large ensemble casts and depictions of lonely characters detached from society. In this film, he is getting at the same thing. Lancaster Dodd or as the people in the film refer to him as- Master, is played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Freddie Quell is played by Joaquin Phoenix. These are two entirely different men. Freddie is a drifter, a man with no sense of direction or purpose. He is an unstable, tormented ticking time bomb with a propensity towards anger and violent outbursts. He is not someone you want to get into a fight with. Freddie is also susceptible to booze and promiscuous women. He creates his own bizarre and sometimes lethal cocktail mixtures. He'll sleep with any woman as long as the opportunity presents itself. I think he'd fit right in on the Jersey Shore cast. Lancaster on the other hand is a man who lives by his own firm set of principles, a man with so much zeal and conviction for the malarkey he has concocted and manifested through hefty books and pamphlets. He is a pseudo-intellectual who according to his son makes stuff up as he goes. So what brings these two men together? Why are they so attracted to one another? At first, it seems like their friendship is incidental. But as the film progresses, you start to wonder if these characters have ulterior motives. Lancaster calls Freddie his guinea pig and protégé (emphasis on the word guinea pig). Freddie takes part in Lancaster's experiments, a type of reverse hypnosis called ""Processing"" where Freddie must answer a series of questions and recount painful memories. During this ""Processing"", he cannot blink or else he must start over. Lancaster also puts Freddie through tedious and grueling exercises that are both physically and mentally draining. You start to wonder if this is a genuine friendship or a master-servant relationship. According to Lancaster, he is trying to cure Freddie from his animalistic ways. Is Lancaster sincerely trying to help Freddie get better or is he just taking advantage over a weak and deranged man? I won't reveal the answer to these questions. Amy Adams plays a very convincing Peggy Dodd, the loyal and unwavering wife of Lancaster. Throughout the film, Peggy is distrusting and doubtful of Freddie's existence within the Cause's community. She is afraid that his presence will disrupt the order established within the community. There are some other great supporting roles by Jesse Plemons who plays Val Dodd, the skeptical but reserved son of Lancaster and Christopher Even Welch who plays John More, a man who isn't afraid to call Lancaster out on his own bullshit. ""The Master"" does not rely on gimmicks or plot devices of any sort. Instead, it relies on the strong and mesmerizing performances of its actors. It is a film that abandons the idea of formality and conventionalism. It does not follow any particular narrative structure neither does it tell a cohesive or coherent story. ""The Master"" is a well-made film carried by incredible and indelible performances that warrant Oscar attention. Unfortunately, the fine performances by Phoenix, Hoffman, and Adams are a bit obscured by a dull and lifeless plot. I understand that this movie was strictly intended as a character study and for that, I appreciated it. However, the characters in this film are a complete bore to hang out with, especially for 137 minutes. Ultimately, ""The Master"" lacked the vivacity and exuberance exhibited in ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"" and ""There Will Be Blood."" Another problem I had with the film was the absence of Anderson's inventive use of the camera. There were a lot of static and tracking shots that were too literal and not indicative of artistic expression. However, some of the fixed camera angles were well utilized because they captured the pure essence of the moments shared by Anderson's characters. Although Anderson has never admitted that this film is based on Scientology, the parallels are conspicuous. This is probably the most personal film Anderson has written and directed. The idea for ""The Master"" had been inside of Anderson's head for around 12 years. Anderson has lived in Los Angeles for 40 years, a city flowing with Scientological abundance. And on the most personal note, friends of Anderson, Jeremy Blake and Theresa Duncan allegedly committed suicide in 2007 because they could no longer endure harassment from Scientologists. Coming into this film, I didn't know much about Scientology. The only thing I knew was that it compelled you to jump ecstatically on couches and ask for massages of the phallus region. All kidding aside, I was hoping to gain some new, profound insight on Scientology. I was hoping that Anderson would explore The Cause's origins, endeavors, oppositions, battles, successes, and failures. Perhaps, this wasn't the type of film Anderson intended on making. I believe the trailer for ""The Master"" does such a disservice for this film. It makes you believe that it will be an entirely different movie. On a positive note, the cinematography by Mihai Malaimare Jr. was absolutely gorgeous and reminiscent of Hitchcock's films. The music also suited the film very well. And ""The Master"" ends on a very haunting yet subtle note. I recommend seeing this film on pure acting alone. ""The Master"" contains some of the finest acting I've seen in a great while. It is nowhere near Anderson's best work but it is still a good watch. I still believe in the Church of Paul Thomas Anderson. I have faith that his next effort will be stronger and resonate more with me. And I'm really glad that none of the characters uttered ""I'm finished"" at the end of the film because ""The Master"" seemed very incomplete."
246,The Master,9,27 September 2012,PTA's best film in over a decade.,"Now, I'm going to say something that I'm pretty sure every critic before me has said, which is: ""The Master"" is yet another visually perfect film (the first movie to be filmed entirely in 65mm since 1996) from critically acclaimed writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, only accentuated by award worthy performances from the likes of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Joaquin Phoenix and Amy Adams. Where mine (and so many others, according to Rotten Tomatoes) opinions may differ from a select few (mostly PTA fans) is how engrossing I found the actual story (the script) the dialogue and character development to be.The Plot: ""The Master"" tells the story of a Naval veteran, returning from WWII, named Freddie Quell (Phoenix) who seems to have some form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. After an attempt to go find some kind of normality in his life as a civilian, he begins to grow more and more aware of how disengaged he has become. One night, he stumbles upon a party on board a ship and becomes enraptured with an eccentrically charismatic man everyone on board refers to as The Master (Hoffman). It comes to light that The Master is the leader of a newly formed organization, whose objective is to ""help"" people discover a meaning to their lives, by having them engage in odd, repetitive and seemingly meaningless exercises. The Master soon becomes rather intrigued by Freddie's submissive personality and takes him as his right-hand-man.OK, so just to get this out of the way, I can see how some could find this film rather boring, filled with arbitrary filler and tedious conversations (if you were expecting a movie advanced via action sequences) and I can also understand how those who go into the ""The Master"" thinking that it is going to be a plain-as-day lampooning of Scientology, may find themselves a little disappointed with the subject matter this film fixates on. And yes, this movie is about twenty minutes too long, with an ending that left me a bit empty, BUT in saying all of that, what PTA has accomplished here is the telling of an ambitious story though a series of fascinating thoughts and ideas, which blossom right before our eyes. Furthermore, PTA develops what would have been a rudimentary plot, into a deeply philosophical meditation on what constitutes a follower versus a leader and also what the difference is between religion and cult.Side Note to the PTA Apologists: My past reservations surrounding Paul Thomas Anderson's previous works have been widely criticized, mostly by people who are so in love with PTA's visual stylizing that they have time and time again flippantly looked past the man's egregiously flawed story lines; excluding ""Boogie Nights. But ""The Master"" shows a masterful (you see what I did there?) return to form for PTA, as not just a visual God, but also a filmmaker who can construct a layered and quite engrossing plot, which thrives off of its symbolism and aloofness. And while the term ""aloofness"" may not make many want to run out and buy a ticket, PTA successfully keeps ""most"" audiences enraptured in a 137 minute film, where (admittedly) not a lot is physically going on, on the surface.Final Thought: ""The Master"" doesn't use any Scientology terminology, but rather transports its viewer into the inception of a Scientology-esque religion. So, whether this is an accurate portrayal of L. Ron Hubbard or not is almost irrelevant here, and has little merit on how thought provoking ""The Master"" indeed is. Because the fact is, this is not your everyday cult film. This isn't even in the same vein as last year's ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"". ""The Master"" is more like this year's ""The Tree of Life""; to some it will play out like watching a tremendously rich piece of artwork (that could never be fully understood in one sitting) while for others playing out as a mishmash of nonsensical scenes wrapped in unintelligible themes. In short, I am definitely recommending that people see this film, as it is one of the best of the year; even though many die-hard PTA fans will hate it for some inexplicable reason.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

247,The Master,9,24 September 2012,An Epic Film About the Power Of Faith,"""The Master"" is one of the best films of 2012. It has magnificent performances from Jaoquin Phoenix as a returning WWII seaman badly damaged by the war and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the eponymous charismatic leader of a new movement known as ""The Cause"". Amy Adams is excellent as the master's wife and true believer. This is a big, epic film beautifully photographed by Mihai Malaimare Jr. in 70mm with a wonderful score by Jonny Greenwood. The screenplay by Paul Thomas Anderson is a grand evocation of the post-WWII era landscape inhabited with new age messiahs eager to proselytize the gullible and his direction masterfully balances the sweeping character of the times with the intimate and complex relationship between Hoffman and Phoenix. Phoenix's character, Freddie Quell, is a tormented man driven by seemingly insatiable primitive desires. Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd is a man of ideas, of intellect. When he encounters Quell he is drawn to the strange man perhaps as an ultimate challenge to his new ideas to improve the human condition. A battle of wills ensues. Can faith overcome Quell's demons? Is he substituting one form of addiction for another? Is Dodd really interested in rescuing people or is he merely interested in controlling them?"
248,The Master,8,23 September 2012,insanity of belief,"Paul Thomas Anderson has so far been quite possibly the best director of his generation: ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"" and ""There Will Be Blood"". Now comes ""The Master"". You may have heard that it's about a religion similar to Scientology, but that description alone doesn't do the movie justice. In addition to posing the question of the religion's authenticity, the movie also poses the question of society's authenticity in general.Joaquin Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a jaded WWII vet. One evening, he happens onto the boat of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Dodd is the leader of what he calls The Cause, a new type of philosophical movement that he is trying to spread. Dodd decides to take Freddie under his wing. But over time, Freddie begins to question Dodd's methods, eventually suspecting that The Cause is less a philosophy than a cult.The plot carries two meanings. Freddie's role in the religious cult is little different from his place in the world before that. His short temper and drinking problem had kept him from holding down a job prior to joining The Cause. Post-war America, supposedly the supreme manifestation of idealism, was not going to be the true panacea for Freddie. Can American society simply not something what it is professed to be? In addition to Phoenix and Hoffman, the movie also turns in fine performances from Amy Adams, Laura Dern, and several others. The boat's wake constitutes some of the most impressive cinematography ever. The year is not over, so I don't know if it's safe to call ""The Master"" the best movie of the year, but it's up there. It's one that you gotta see."
249,The Master,9,23 September 2012,Siddhartha of Scientology's Bizarre Bromance,"By the time Joaquin Phoenix's Freddie Quell, a troubled, boisterous, alcoholic Second World War veteran, realizes, ""He's making it up as he goes"" about The Master, a writer/guru named Lancaster Dodd played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, you'll wish he didn't realize it so soon  because Dodd can be hypnotizing and his cure seems legit. But that's only because Quell is so messed up to begin with, and we spend the first quarter struggling through his violently meandering post-war life That when Freddie begins to come around, we finally get to know the character we've been burdened with thus far.Gaining flashbacks of the young girl he loves while Dodd asks pointed questions  which need to be answered without hesitation or the blink of an eye  makes for a moving scene bringing two intensely lonesome characters together. So what if Dodd's practice, loosely (or not so loosely) based on Scientology, is really an empty road If it can turn a human mess like Quell into more than a mysterious stranger, so be it. He still holds onto his independent strength, only now he has something, or rather someone, to fight for.And it's true that writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, no stranger to big dynamic overlong productions, takes advantage of the fact he's created a cult leader who speaks more than he means and doesn't always make sense, giving the script free reign to meander without a structured plot or purpose. Despite the title, this is really about The Follower. And as the audience witnesses the turnaround of a truly lost soul, they'll either follow or lose faith. But there's no denying the dynamic performances of the two lead actors. If anything else, it's one heck of a bizarre, and truly unique and original, buddy film.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"
250,The Master,9,22 September 2012,"Not quite a great film, but a great experience","SPOILERS.Producer JoAnne Sellars said that THE MASTER wasn't about Scientology, and she wasn't putting us on; the film isn't so much about ""The Cause"" as it is about how The Cause factors into Freddie Quell's (Joaquin Phoenix) attempts to become a part of society, and how this man, tortured and alienated as he is, cannot embrace it the way people with seemingly more normal lives can.Freddie, as we learn, has troubles aplenty: his father died a drunk, his mother went insane, he committed incest with an aunt, he himself is a near-hopeless alcoholic...and he's prone to fits of rage which, as performed by Phoenix, are terrifying, pitiable, and only deepen his detachment from the world. Lost and afraid, he and the leader of The Cause, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) meet by chance--or perhaps not, as Dodd seems convinced they have known each other before.Freddie is drawn into the fold, and soon proves an over-zealous acolyte, physically attacking both a man who criticizes Dodd at a party and a group of policemen who arrest Dodd for fraudulent medical practices. Dodd is entranced with him and his troubles nonetheless, ignoring the doubts of his wife (Amy Adams). Ultimately, Freddie and Dodd part ways, but not before a final meeting where Freddie realizes that he can never commit to The Cause, just as he seemingly cannot commit to a home, to a job, or to a lover; we then see him re-enacting a Cause ritual with a woman he has picked up in a pub, and the film ends with him lying next to a nude woman made of sand, a memory from his Navy days which illustrates how true commitment and human connection is beyond him; all he has are fantasies and primal urges.Phoenix's performance is nothing short of astounding; he is wholly committed to Freddie's madness and pain, his reflexive laughter, his rage, his frustrated sexuality, and all the other parts of his fractured psyche. To use a cliché, he does as much with his eyes and face as most actors would with dialogue AND their entire bodies; it's a perfect match of actor and character, and an Oscar should be in Phoenix's future.Another Oscar might be in Philip Seymour Hoffman's future as well, for as Dodd, he is no less brilliant. Dodd is, if anything, the more complex character, because we are never sure how much of his gospel he actually believes. His son (Jesse Plemons) at one point says that Dodd is making it all up (which nearly earns him a beating from Freddie), but later we see him as a fully established member of the Cause hierarchy; whether he came to believe his father's words or was simply sucked in by the potential for power, we cannot say.But if Dodd is a charlatan, he never breaks his facade; he appears truly to believe his words (it's implied The Cause has been around for some time before Freddie and Dodd meet), and Hoffman never drops the mask either, playing straight such moments as Dodd's singing to Freddy in their final confrontation, or in the same scene explaining their association in a previous life. Hoffman plays it all with perfect sincerity, and his interaction with Phoenix--the film's real core--is marvelous to say the least.One of the friends whom I saw it with felt that the film had no philosophical depth, which falls somewhat in line with Ebert's assertion that the film lacks a real core. But I'd argue the film DOES have a core, and that core is Freddie's doomed quest to be a part of civilized society, and how that manifests itself in his relationship with Dodd. It's really a character study, and a good one at that. There ARE some flaws in the script; Amy Adams has a surprisingly truncated role, a few secondary plots go undeveloped, the timeline of the film is a bit murky, etc--but none of these flaws are at all fatal, for again, the film is a great experience.I didn't see it in 70mm, but I saw it in a fine theater with top-line projection, and it was gorgeous to see. Mihai Malaimare Jr, a cinematographer who has mostly done latter-day Coppola films, displays an amazing eye for composition, and the film is a constant treat to look at. The production design and costuming are alike fine.P.T. Anderson's direction is superb from first to last; he shows not only his keen fascination with a specific millieu, but with the dark nature of humanity. Often the camera will linger on this or that painful or startling image (like Freddie imagining a roomful of naked women surrounding the singing, dancing, possibly drunk Dodd), and the patience Anderson shows pays off by simply being fun to watch; for those who love the art of filmmaking, THE MASTER should be a positive feast.Lastly, Jonny Greenwood's score--haunting, lush, discordant--is the perfect accompaniment to this flawed, haunting, masterful (had to) tale. It falls JUST short of being the year's best film, but it's a must-see nonetheless."
251,The Master,9,21 September 2012,"Recollection, imagination, exploration, and much more","Paul Thomas Anderson has directed some of the finest films of our time. working with Phillip Seymor Hoffman again, this ""dream team"" has proved that the film industry is not based on teen flicks, slasher films, 3D, and visual effects. The Master is filled with thought-provoking moments, disturbing and wondrous situations, complexity in the characters, and a beautiful look at finding truth in the world. Jaoquin Phoenix is absolutely phenomenal, and will no doubt garner/win the Oscar this year for his frightening, compelling, and tragic role as Freddy. This film is not about Scientology, but rather a look into the lives of two very different men as they come together to fix the events in their lives that brought them together in the first place. Masterfuly directed, OUTSTANDINGLY acted, filmed with grace, and balanced with a haunting score, The Master is must see for those who love art. For people who enjoy going to see a movie, though, you have been warned that this may not be the film for you."
252,The Master,,21 September 2012,"The Master is NOT about Scientology, but it IS masterful filmmaking","Spoiler alert: I'm not going to spoil the movie, just the promotional campaign. The buzz leading up to this movie has been suggesting it is a thinly veiled exposé of the founding of Scientology. Not only does that sound like a fascinating movie, it's an act of daring for a director to potentially provoke an organization that besides being entrenched among Hollywood's elite, is known to exact punitive consequences on those who displease them.This movie is NOT about Scientology. Its theme is MUCH bigger. It's about the conditions of life that allow movements like Scientology to thrive.Joaquin Phoenix plays a character named Freddy Quell. We meet Freddy as the chapter of his life in the Navy is ending; we hear the announcement of the armistice that ended World War II. Freddy enters a military mental health program that intends to assist his transition back to civilian life. It quickly becomes clear that Freddy's problems are much bigger than the military could hope to handle, and he is released into the world untrained and unprepared. He acts inappropriately in social situations which keeps him from sustaining any kind of lasting relationship, the absence of which is filled with strong drink.Director Paul Thomas Anderson offers no back story to explain why Freddy's so disturbed, but it's clear his drinking is an attempt to soothe deep, deep wounds, the kind that are inflicted in infancy and childhood and take a lifetime to overcome. Freddy is a walking black hole, the perfect mark for Philip Seymour Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd, a.k.a. The Master, a man not unlike L. Ron Hubbard, who claims not only to understand and know how to treat Freddie, but offers him the best prize of all: the company of other people who will accept him and give him a place where he can belong.Dodd has his own pathology: he needs lost souls like Freddie to hand over their autonomy to him. Dodd develops a name for himself on the ""seeking-circuit,"" holding center stage at packed gatherings in Park Avenue duplexes and enjoying extended stays at the Philadelphia mansion of a wealthy East Coast devotee, Helen Sullivan (Laura Dern). Freddy is happy to be his performance monkey as The Master manipulates his emotions as entertainment for his guests. Freddy has a place to stay, food to eat, and has achieved acceptance.The scene at the Park Avenue duplex is noteworthy. Freddie's inappropriate behavior towards the upper crust hostess is an indication that he has received no real treatment. Dodd publicly hypnotizes a willing matron, something that today seems should occur in private, but was likely a precursor to the group acid trips that would take place only ten years later.During this scene, Dodd is challenged by John More (Christopher Evan Welch) who challenges Dodd's methods with weak scientific arguments. It plays out rather perfunctorily and is unconvincing. Ironically, More interrupts Dodd as he is performing a hypnosis technique that today is called phobia desensitization, an accepted and effective psychological treatment.While the timing of the interruption diminishes the scientific counterargument, Dodd appears to earnestly believe in his teachings. Whether or not Hubbard believed his own theology, such earnestness did not exist with him. Many documents and recordings exist that reveal his opprobrious recruitment techniques, his obsessive quest to capture celebrities, and his admitting his goal in creating a religion was to become rich.Dodd's earnestness doesn't make up for his lack of credentials and irresponsibility of Freddy's ""care."" Dodd is still a charlatan, and while he seems remotely haunted by this truth, only his son Kyle (Jesse Plemons) voices this opinion in a surprisingly frank moment, fearless of consequences. The truth does not set him free however, and years later, when Dodd has moved abroad to ""continue his work"" his adult son seems genuinely happy to be a part of the family business. The need to belong is a powerful force, and I think the rewards of positive attention from his father have polluted the soil that made that comment, extinguishing whatever life that seed of truth may have sprouted.There will always be people will holes in their souls. There will always be people who feed and profit from their pain. They usually go to California, where the sunshine and possibility of becoming a star can delay the onset of the inevitable existential pain.Paul Thomas Anderson is a treat of a director for a movie snob: no easy answers, ambiguous endings, and performances by master actors at the top of their game, although I think Joaquin Phoenix put too much of his method on display. He could stand to learn from his co-star: if you're a great actor, with a powerful instrument with which to work, you can use restraint in your performance without losing any wattage. There is no moral, no lessons learned, no story lines neatly tied, no indication of potential epilogues for the two leading characters. The story ends. As it should."
253,The Master,4,5 October 2012,"great actors tearing up the scenery,","Man, I wanted to like this movie, notwithstanding the great set-up, the context, the music, the titanic changes afoot at the time, nothing really happened, nothing really meant much, it became a small character study that never achieved ""escape"" velocity. It stayed small and we were left with wondering if it mattered that Phoenix's character was always crazy, war damaged, getting better, getting worse and how this might have moved into some kind of narrative arc greater than these questions. Similarly, we could ask the same questions for Hoffman's character. And frankly, the movie felt tedious and punitive. Notwithstanding the surreal elements, e.g. the phone call in the theater, this movie seemed hermetically sealed. Not sure if this was a problem in initial conceptualization or simply a failed attempt. Too bad, ""there will be blood"" did achieve ""escape velocity"" There was a well embedded context, and the actors were doing their great acting in service to something that managed to mean something. The despicable main character wasn't just a grotesque but was made ""real"" by the context and the context made real by the character, that is, this character was part and parcel of the time and place, a physical manifestation of this cold blooded, manipulative capitalism and the myth of the American dream. Really not sure what was being examined in the Master."
254,The Master,9,24 September 2012,The Master is an amazing character drama that while light on story still manages to leave a real impact,"The Master is master(no pun intended) filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson's latest character drama that delves into the depths of two eccentric men's minds as they discover each other and eventually have a rather odd relationship as Lancaster Dodd builds his cult with his far-fetched ideas. Starting a year or so ago Anderson began talking up The Master before it even had the title. Needless to say, Anderson's movie has been something film critics and lovers have been waiting for for ever since Anderson's 2007 film There Will Be Blood. Does Anderson's take on the Scientology- like cult make the wait worth it or has Anderson set the bar too high for himself?Read the Full Review: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-h7"
255,The Master,5,22 September 2012,One of the best films of the year.,"This movie is beautiful, complex, philosophical, haunting. PT Anderson proves himself again with this provocative drama. This movie is a serious film for serious film fans, the general public will reject it because it's not the fast paced they expect but the ones who enjoy film as an art is going to love this film and it's style. It's loaded with amazing performances, and I will say Oscar worthy and it's without question the most Oscar worthy film I seen all year. The Master is a great piece of film. It challenges it's audience while also holding their interest. The movie is about a WWII veteran named Freddy Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) who is completely unstable, lost and above all, a drunk. He travels from place to place, why? Maybe to find himself, find hope, acceptance? Freddy goes into a ship and meets a charismatic man named Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymore Hoffman) who goes by the name ""The Master"" who runs a cult that is supposedly a ""Self Help"" supposedly cures everyone from pain, even diseases. Yes, it's similar to Scientology anyone who has been informed about the subject is going to see the connections. Anyways, Freddy accepts help (or attempted help) u Lancaster and his process. Of course we see that Lancaster like L.Ron Hubbard was a fraud, and if anyone challenges his teachings gets snapped at. Hoffman gives a very amazing performance and is very convincing. Phoenix gives the best performance I've seen all year and if he doesn't win an Oscar, then I will know how corrupt the Academy really is. I challenge all future movies to have a performance better than his. The Master was shot in 70mm film and one can tell, the picture was clear and crisp and the colors were vibrant. This was a huge strength to the movie, the cinematography was nothing short of extraordinary. Actually the highlight of the whole movie really, the visuals told the story that PT Anderson was trying to tell. Sometimes there were moments of no dialog but there didn't need to be, the movie spoke for itself, loud and clear. The Master was brilliant, it's one of the best films of the year. So far still though, The Dark Knight Rises is my favorite movie of the year for a lot of reasons but The Master is second. This movie is a must see, it's also one of the most memorable movies of the year. I will warn all, the pacing is slow, it's not going to be for everyone, but it's definitely for me. I rate The Master an A+."
256,The Master,10,22 September 2012,True Masters at Work Here!!,"You can call this review ""The Master Redux"", because after seeing this master of a movie for the second time, I have upgraded it from a good category to an excellent or better stated ""masterful"" one. This is unprecedented in the history of my film reviews when I have altered a movie review upon its second viewing. Try to hold your excitement. Nevertheless, here is my ""The Master"" Redux Review. Before you read my review of ""The Master"", please keep in mind that I do not declare myself to be ""a doctor, a writer, or even a viable film critic""; but I am definitely a ""cornypun theoretical philosopher"". I have been masterwaiting (see what I mean) Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" with profound anticipation for the last four years. Undoubtedly, Anderson is a master himself as proved through his impressive filmmaking resume'. ""The Master"" is set in post World War II and stars a pitch-perfect Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell, A Naval veteran officer who drunkenly drifts from place to place causing havoc everywhere Fast-Five-Drinks Freddie inhabits to. He also is a nymphomaniac who strives to master the sexual act with almost every woman he encounters; and is quite a master of his domain himself by wanking it even in public. Freddie gets a gig as a photographer, but that picture does not develop too clear due to the fact that he gets into a physical altercation with a customer and therefore loses the gig. Freddie is also a maker of a masterful alcoholic potent resembling a moonshine beverage, sort of speak. On the run, Freddie comes across a boat inhabited by a group of individuals led by the master himself Lancaster Dobb. In a pivotal scene of the movie, Freddie meets Dobb and is engaged by Dobb's swift and commanding presence. Dobb declares himself to be a ""doctor, writer, and a theoretical philosopher"". Dobb is worshiped by many and always presents himself with an enigmatic presence. He leads a group for ""The Cause"" a self-created religion which Anderson depicts it very similar to L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology. ""He Blinded Me With Science"" should have been the title of one of Hubbard's theoretical writings; let's just leave it at that. Freddie gets into ""The Cause"" and is enlightened by Dobb's theoretical verbose. Dobb's young wife Peggy is not too enamored by Freddie and tries to persuade her husband to stray away from him. Dobb has a daughter that takes a liking to Freddie; her husband is also a sold advocate of ""The Cause"". The main cynic of ""The Cause"" is none other than Dobb's son Val, who proclaims to Freddie that daddy Lancaster is ""making it all up as he goes along""; which pretty much describes most of my movie reviews. Anderson excelled in delivering yet another movie unique like any other; whether you love it or hate, you must acknowledge its distinctiveness. It really does take two viewings to fully grasp Anderson's vision of ""The Master"". Upon my first viewing ""The Master"", I was quite befuddled by it; but upon a return visit to ""The Master"", I was completely enamored by it and joined in the cause why Anderson is very deserving of a Best Director and Screenplay Oscar nomination. Phoenix's performance was (what's the word?) MASTERFUL! And the Phoenix should rise to the Oscar podium when he is handed a Best Actor Academy Award. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was masterful himself as the captivating Lancaster Dobb. I also loved Amy Adams' restrained but powerful performance as Dobb's wife Peggy. Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s cinematography was nothing less than brilliant. Johnny Greenwood's booming score should score him a Best Score Oscar nomination. ""The Master"" is deserving of a Master's Degree in the field of Mass Cinematic Communication. Master it today!!!***** Excellent"
257,The Master,1,14 January 2017,Probably the worst film I have ever seen,"This was horrendously bad. The only enjoyment I had was joking with the person who was watching it with me about how bad it was. Because the characters are so unlikable you expect the story to be good but NO. I kept waiting for something worthwhile to happen or even anything for the characters to say/do that was slightly worthwhile to watch but NO. How do some people like this?? This was insultingly bad. Another example of sheep saying they like a film because their afraid their wrong for not liking it and if there are people who genuinely liked to watch this they have serious issues.This was horrendously bad.

258,The Master,9,14 August 2013,"A fine, complex character-driven film","Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) delivers an interesting analogy about comparing his fears to a dragon. To defeat the dragon, he uses a lasso to neck it, wrestle it, and then control it. The basis of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" is this analogy. The central character is Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), an alcoholic, ill-tempered, disturbed man who fantasizes frequently about sex. As Lancaster Dodd calls ""a scoundrel."" Chance or even maybe fate, Freddie stumbles upon an intriguing group called ""The Cause,"" led by Lancaster Dodd and his passive aggressive wife Peggy (Amy Adams). Most of the movie centers on the relationship between Quell and Dodd, as it becomes sort of a game between the two as Quell not only lets Dodd help face his troubles, or rather his fears, but also surrender like the dragon. The second factor that makes ""The Master"" an interesting film is another perspective that Lancaster Dodd shares with Freddie Quell. He states in their first meeting that: ""I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist, and a theoretical philosopher. But above all, I am a man, a hopelessly inquisitive man, just like you."" While both Quell and Dodd are at opposites end of the spectrum, one in a bad path and the other a so-called good one, they are still human--and it is up to Quell whether he changes his ways or not. The philosophy and ideas brought up in this film are so in-depth and unique that only a true auteur filmmaker could write and direct. Paul Thomas Anderson is a true genius of a screenwriter and just as superfluous a director. He knows how to make complex characters and punch in moments of brilliant writing.He is not alone in the works of his film. The cast fills in the gaps that breathes life into his movie. Joaquin Phoenix immerses himself fully in his role as Quell. His mannerisms, gait, gestures, and even tone of voice is perfect for such a lost character. He does not rely on delivering false sympathy for his performance, like some actors would. Instead, he makes him feel raw and real, like someone in his character's lifestyle would be. I argue that he could very well be the next Daniel Day-Lewis if he keeps this talent up. Philip Seymour Hoffman turns in perhaps his best performance since ""Capote."" He goes against performing as the traditional charismatic religious cult leader and gives us an individual who is as kind as he is manipulative. On the outside he looks like a nice, plump fellow but is really a die hard control freak. Amy Adams seems to blend in the background in comparison to Phoenix and Hoffman, however, she has her moments of sharp-tongued dialog that works to her advantage. All three were nominated for Oscars and none of them won. It was tough competition this year. I am kind of disappointed in this. I wish there were more Oscar ties. Phoenix and Hoffman were equally deserving as the 2013 winners Lewis and Waltz.The other thing that bothers me is that Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s cinematography did not receive any accolade recognition at all. Each shot in this movie is beautifully and carefully composed, whether it is the opening shot of the Pacific Ocean or the closing frame of Joaquin Phoenix's face on a beach. The lighting, camera movements, and compositions are simply extravagant, right up there with Roger Elswit's breathtaking feat for Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood."" Even if a person does not like this movie, the director of photography's work should not go unnoticed.As much as I seem to praise this film, I still find faults. Moments in the story seem random or unclear. Some scenes involving sexual content are enough to come off as perverted, forcing me to chuckle out of sheer discomfort. Paul Thomas Anderson can certainly make people cringe in his films, just watch ""Boogie Nights."" But this seeming trademark of his could have been removed from this film and add some serious plausibility instead of embarrassing absurdity. ""The Master"" is a film of acquired taste. Many big critics love it while the general audience seems to dish it aside. If you have not figured it out by now, I personally enjoyed it. 9/10"
259,The Master,5,5 April 2013,Drowned in its own depth,"""The Master"" is an unequivocally deep movie but unfortunately that very depth works to make it practically impenetrable. On the surface we have the story of WWII sailor (Freddie Quell, mesmerisingly played by Joaquin Phoenix) who has seen action (or mostly inaction as depicted in the film) in the Pacific. Freddie is instantly established as an oddball loner with an inordinate passion for sex and alcohol (or any mixture of chemicals that might vaguely resemble such) - giving us our first theme of addiction.As we move through the movie it becomes clear that the character is also afraid of anything that might resemble commitment - running away when a love affair or friendship gets to stage that might require more than just pure loyalty.After running away (again) from a threatening situation (associated more with his chemical mixing abilities than any form of commitment) Freddie stows away on a yacht bound for New York. That he is drawn to ""The Master"" (ably played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, but nowhere near stretching his extraordinary depth of acting talent), who has chartered the yacht for his family and friends for the trip, is no great surprise. What is surprising is the Master's seeming infatuation with this alcoholic loser.Thus the movie revolves around the two men's relationship, though it is never really clear who is conning who, and what benefits (if any) each receives from the other.Possibly the Master is seeking to get some form of commitment to his ""cause"", but why bother when there are far softer souls to be plucked? Maybe Freddie is looking for some sort of father figure, or searching for the truth, but why bother when apathy appears to be his strongest characteristic?Since the ending sees Freddie bedding yet another female conquest, appropriately picked up in an English pub, one has to wonder if the message is simply that come what may, if ones character predisposes them to addictions and an inability to commit then ""c'ést la vie"" - they will always be so inclined regardless of intervention and persuasion.A finely crafted and acted movie that, unfortunately, loses its message(s) along the way."
260,The Master,6,1 April 2013,Jack of all trades.  Master of...,"There's a better movie in here somewhereThe Master is PTA's attempt at a John Steinbeck novel. So much so, I felt as if Of Mice and Men was unfolding from time to time. But then when a scene would end, I was thrown into a John Cassavettes film of explosive human emotion. After that, I couldn't remember what I was watching. Then they ride a motorcycle and then England and it's over.The large format and ambient light photography preach to high hopes. The actors are all faultless. And somewhere in there, there's a great film. But this isn't it.All the good stuff is on the surface, below that, it's paper thin. PTA pretty much left anything interesting on the editing floor, or for some other movie. Essentially, you see what you want to believe in the Master. So it may work for you or against the film. But having seen it twice now, I can confirm the following.The photography and lighting are great. The performances are solidThat's it.He really is becoming more and more like Terrence Malick every day which is disappointing because the real Masters write their own book."
261,The Master,2,31 March 2013,A wasted 144 minutes.  Avoid at all costs!,"Pointless, plot-less, slow, meandering, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, way too long, devoid of any redeeming value. This is the worst movie I've seen since Mulholland Drive--maybe since Eraserhead. Joaquin Phoenix is even homelier than in previous movies and way too old to play the part of a sailor leaving the service after WWII. His acting is wooden and stylized, like he has an acting coach pulling his strings in every scene. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who is one of my favorite actors, is wasted on this train wreck of a movie. All the actors go through the motions of delivering their lines, obviously having no clue what emotion to put into them, because they are as confused as the audience about what the heck is going on. The writer/director shows obvious contempt for the audience by larding the movie with gratuitous disgusting scenes. How they managed to bamboozle the public into shelling out $32M at the box office is beyond understanding. All those critics who recommended this stinker should never be trusted again."
262,The Master,1,11 March 2013,no spoiler here,"I could not even watch long enough. Not what I was suspecting at all. I was initially intrigued by the story of Scientology and the historical movement, but this movie devolved into a who are they and what are they doing. Sorry, not buying it. The whole conspiracy thing is way overdone and don't you think if that were the case it would have been discovered before now? Wake up and smell the latte people!!!!My husband and I used to call this a ""Charlie Bubbles"" movie--we tried several times to watch that movie and could never make heads nor tails out of that movie either.It's hard to believe that this movie was singled out for Oscar nominations when ""Lincoln"" was ignored."
263,The Master,2,4 March 2013,Two method actors ad-libbing to a Pynchon of a script,"I heard many things about The Master before I finally got to see it: Should have won the Oscar, daring, ""should be mentioned in one breath with 'Citizen Cane'"" (Der Spiegel), The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw called it an ""arresting and utterly absorbing psychological drama"". And so forth with the accolades.So I was very unpleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a disjointed, tedious mess of a movie. It's about a messed-up WWII veteran (Joaquin Phoenix), and a rotund charlatan (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who somehow ended up in the same movie. Although the director doesn't seem to have anything he wants to tell us, he made this movie one full hour longer than necessary, and to really go all-out he shot it in an arcane format (70 millimeter).To be sure, the movie looks great, sounds great, and there are great actors turning in great performances. And Paul Thomas Anderson is a promising director. Only, he didn't deliver this time. Apparently, inspirations for the movie were stories from a veteran he had worked with, and John Steinbeck, and L. Ron Hubbard. Great, it's all there. But those inspirations and subplots never form a story.Another question is why so many reviewers not only defend but applaud a movie that's going nowhere on a very big and slow boat."
264,The Master,8,28 February 2013,The Vidiot Reviews,"The MasterIt is unfortunate after saving the world from Hitler that service men returned home only to doom it by creating Baby Boomers.Fortunately, the seaman in this drama has consumed enough torpedo fuel to sterilize himself.Due to shell shock and his penchant for paint-thinner, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) has a hard time adjusting to life after WWII.But Freddie's skill with mind-melting moonshine finds him in the company of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the founder of The Cause.Welcomed to the movement, which includes Dodd's wife (Amy Adams), Freddie becomes Dodd's subject in psychological experiments.But when Dodd's dogma is doubted, Freddie's faith in him is too.With a volatile performance from Phoenix, this abnormal masterpiece is an absorbing assessment of a pseudo-religion and candid depiction of post-war America.Incidentally, thanks to the vague teachings of ""spirituality"", nowadays, people are no longer susceptible to cult-like religious movements. Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com"
265,The Master,6,12 February 2013,Very bizarre and deep and I'm not sure I totally understood the entire movie. A movie about a Scientology type cult. I say B-,"""I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist and a theoretical philosopher but above all a man, just like you."" After coming home from the war Naval veteran Freddie Quell (Phoenix) isn't sure of who he is or what he wants to do. In between PTSD breakdowns he drinks and one night stumbles onto a boat where he meets Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), the leader of ""The Cause"". Freddie begins to question the teaching of ""The Master"" and that's when the trouble starts. This is a very very hard movie to review. For one the movie was very deep and I'm not sure I fully understood what it was supposed to mean. What I got was the movie was about a Scientology type ""religion"" and how they try and recruit new members and how they brainwash members into believing what they want. The movie was very bizarre and hard to understand and follow, for me at least. What I will say is that the acting by Phoenix and Hoffman was great and I enjoyed watching them. This is definitely not a movie for everyone and if you do watch it be prepared for a bizarre journey. Overall, I'm not really sure if I liked it or not because it was so deep and strange and hard to understand every aspect of it. I give it a B-."
266,The Master,9,6 February 2013,Master Class Character study of Alter Egos (Spoilers),"I had the great fortune of seeing this movie 2 days ago and it hasn't really left my mind. It seems to be challenging me to find something about how I can be more attune to understanding my weaknesses and how I view my relationships with others. 'Human frailty and search for answers /redemption' are basically the central themes of this movie.But alas the great irony (to me anyhow), you'll find no such redemption or typical narrative Hollywood storytelling in this movie. Nor do we follow a similar path tread by any other movies, none which I can recall anyway. The acting by Joaquin Phoenix is utterly primevil and engrossing. We don't arrive at the end and say, 'oh that guy is a better person for thinking this or behaving like that'. There are no resolutions. It is a story about an intense and complicated friendship (some say love story) between two men with alter egos who despite their obvious inadequacies and at times repulsive behaviour find some extraordinary kinship in trusting and believing in one another.Here in lies the tragedy - the summation of such a profound friendship does not equate to much by the end and this is where many viewers will find the movie unclear/inconclusive and or simply off putting..... That despite such a profound kinship between the two egomaniacs, the movie and the characters essentially ends where it begun. They seem to be souls touched but as easily untouched by each other and those around them. To me the Joaquin Phoenix character is in fact the alter ego of Hoffman's Cult Leader character which is explained in the last scene between the two. 'His sworn enemy in the next life'. I bet there are character traits about ourselves which we would swear now in this present day will be our sworn enemy in the next life. What's the message of the movie? It's just like life. Find it for yourself. Despite the movie being extremely thought provoking it basically leaves us to pick up the pieces and assess what it means to us.I found this movie extremely absorbing viewing which I highly recommend.I currently have it as 48 on my favourites list, but on repeated viewings which no doubt there will be I imagine it may even go higher. I would be interested to know what others think of this alter ego theory or more generally how the movie affected them.CheersMy 100 favorite movies http://www.imdb.com/list/Uvw_F2_GMx8/ What are your favorites?"
267,The Master,7,6 February 2013,This Movie May Be More Than Just What You See at First,"If there was a movie that needs a second or third watching, it may well be this one. At first watching, ""The Master"" will seem long, boring and pointless. However, when you read articles, discussions and reviews about how other people saw the film, you will want to see it again with all these new insights about the film and the story it is trying to tell us.On the surface, ""The Master"" seems to be simply about a sailor Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) who was left psychologically incapacitated by his traumatic experiences during World War II. Finding it difficult to reintegrate himself back into regular society after the war, he finds friendship, assistance and solace from Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a preacher of his own quasi-religious cult, and his family. Will Freddie ever be able to find his way back to normalcy again?This is not a mainstream movie where everything is laid out plainly for the audience to simply enjoy without much mental work required. However, in this movie, writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson, again challenges us with a multi-layered, multi-dimensional film, like his previous masterpieces, ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""Magnolia."" This film is more known for the powerful performances of its two leading actors. Each portrays a character so diametrically opposite the other, yet they still share this inexplicable bond to each other. The best scene for me was that scene set in a prison, where you can see the volatile, violent Freddie Quell side by side with the cool, collected Lancaster Dodd. Joaquin Phoenix really inhabited this tortured character. His ragged face and twisted body reflect the painful physical and mental stresses Freddie was experiencing. Philip Seymour Hoffman was convincing as a charismatic smooth-talking evangelist of his own manufactured religion. They both deserve their Oscar nominations.This movie is not easy to sit through, and it was also very long. I myself had questions in my mind with almost every scene, as to what the purpose of that scene was. There were several scenes of sheer violence and uncomfortable sexuality that will puzzle you. Because of the excellent technical aspects like the cinematography, you knew you were watching something special, but you will not figure it all out immediately or at all. I am sure my rating will go higher the next time I watch it."
268,The Master,8,20 January 2013,There will be Oscars,"The exclusion of Paul Thomas Anderson's film from the best director and best picture short-lists at this year's Oscars is nothing short of scandalous, though perhaps predictable, given that it is about the growth and lure of cult as well as an exploration of madness. Way too tough a subject for an Academy which fawns over such mediocrities as 'The King's Speech'. That said, Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman are deservedly nominated in the best actor and supporting actor categories. They deliver career-best performances. Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd, the autocratic 'master' of a nascent cult called 'The Cause', and Phoenix as Freddie Quell, a mentally afflicted sailor who becomes Dodd's guinea pig. If the characterisation of cult is a fair one, then it is quite disturbing. The main aim of 'The Cause' is to remove man's animal nature and thereby perfect humanity. Dodd gives Quell the love he's never had in return for his life, which includes subjecting him to extreme experiments which do nothing, except increase his insanity. Phoenix appears to have sunk into his own skeleton. Sinewy to the point of masochism, he stomps around ape-like, snarling and talking out of one side of his mouth. Repulsed though I was, I couldn't bear to look away. He has clearly invested every reserve of emotion to play this disturbed, venal character. It would be a shame for him not to win the Oscar based on sheer commitment alone. Amy Adams, also nominated, plays Dodd's brainwashed wife and aide. She unhesitatingly helps implement Dodd's master plan, even subjugating herself to being naked with all other females at a party for members of The Cause. It is an ominous reverse of the docile nun she played in 'Doubt'. The film's title should also refer to Anderson. You get a sense of an artist in complete control of his material. You needn't be attuned to the technical wizardry at play, indeed this may be a distraction; however, the effect proves the skill. You are seduced into this nightmarish world, believing no other reality. 'The Master' arrives five years since Anderson's magnificent 'There will be Blood'. It was worth the wait. It pulverised me. It thrilled, scared and saddened me. I doubt I will forget it anytime soon."
269,The Master,9,12 August 2017,But Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell,"How does Paul Thomas Anderson come up with the idea to study the relationship between a cult leader based off the life of L. Ron Hubbard and a nymphomaniac Navy veteran turned photographer, who becomes absorbed into the cult? This complex relationship and story is utilized to study a simple character dynamic and age-old relationship between father and son, teacher and student, icon and public. Even if Anderson took the story of the Church of Scientology to give birth to his film, how does that story become his character study?It is simply brilliant. The visual feel from the production design to the cinematography itself is superb, all filmed in 70mm. Each of Anderson's films has exceptional cinematography and each scene in this film had the same, where each movement of the camera was calculated and purposeful. So the visual feel was fantastic.But Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell. His performance was as riveting and chill-inducing as Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood (2007), but unfortunately, Phoenix was up against Day-Lewis himself in Lincoln (2012). Undoubtedly, Phoenix's best performance to date. Hoffman breaks his character actor mold and guides Phoenix through the treacherous steps of emotional exploration. Together their character dynamic is so complex and emotionally riveting they match the relationship between Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs (1991). If you have not seen this movie, look forward to watching the interview scenes, which may soon become iconic in cinema.The plot drives the development of Phoenix's character. The development of Phoenix's character puts our traditional morals at conflict. The conflict drives our interest in the plot. Anderson creates an endless loop and bottomless abyss in his film and his study of the human soul and human nature itself. Nevertheless, Anderson's study and corresponding conflict seems implied and sometimes forced. The realistic nature of the interview scenes is not conveyed to every scene of the film. Sometimes the presence of Anderson's hand in the dialogue is felt and found unwelcome. Instead of allowing his fully developed characters develop themselves, it feels as if Anderson crafted dialogue and scenes regardless of his characters' natures to achieve a certain effect. However, the film still remains a masterpiece of human discovery in cinema."
270,The Master,8,8 October 2015,"Great, intriguing movie","Great, intriguing movie. Delves into the world of religious cults, with some interesting observations. Not always entirely coherent though, and there's a fair amount of noise in the script - scenes and sub-plots that are red herrings and/or simply just take up space.Superb performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead role. Incredibly convincing and gritty. Well deserved his Best Leading Actor Oscar nomination, as did Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams for their supporting roles. Perplexing, but definitely worth watching."
271,The Master,8,24 July 2015,Shines If Thought of As a Film About an Aimless Broken Man,"This is an excellent film that requires some thought before passing judgement upon it. Heading into my viewing of the film, I was focused on the idea of the cult and its parallels to that of Scientology. I watched the film though this lens, and it was only upon finishing the film that I realized the mistake in doing so. The film is not about the cult so much as it is about a man who returns from the war broken and unable to exist. He drifts though life for a while without purpose, as his damages and drinking interfere with his ability to exist wherever he goes. In his drifting he chances upon a cult leader, whose magnetic personality draws him under the leader's wing. The relationship between the man and the cult leader is a greatly uneven relationship, one disturbed by the man's ambiguity about his belief in the cult, his unstable personality, and by the doubts of the cult leader's family. The cult itself is unimportant in the narrative, except in how the cult shapes the relationship the man has with the cult leader (the cult is important as an examination of American belief, but not very important to understanding the story being told). With this understanding in mind, one can begin to grasp what the narrative is about: one aimless man's troubled search for a way to exist in this world. Through this lens, one can truly see the incredible film that PTA has crafted. Definitely recommended for those who like intellectual cinema."
272,The Master,8,16 July 2015,"A Complex, Layered Plot with Spellbinding Performances!!","The Master by acclaimed director Paul Thomas Anderson is set in the 1950's and it focuses on Freddie (Joaquin Phoenix) and Lancaster (Philip Seymour Hoffman). I cannot even find the correct adjectives to describe the powerful, Oscar-worthy performances given by two of the finest actors in Hollywood.Lancaster is a self-proclaimed 'Master' who helps people know about their past lives whereas Freddie is a war veteran who is struggling to fit into society. The movie filled with beautiful imagery which is probably filled with metaphors that I did not catch on viewing this film.Paul Thomas Anderson's movies are known to be quite complicated and The Master is no exception. At numerous points during the movie, I failed to understand the significance of a particular scene and the main purpose of the movie.I was drawn into this movie after reading rave reviews by numerous online publications. As a viewer, it is frustrating to not understand the underlying meaning of the events that are taking place in this movie. The innovative soundtrack by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood complements the tone of the movie. The Master smothers you with plot, ideas and images. It is hard to make a proper judgment after a single viewing as the story feels unresolved. However, I cannot deny the brilliance of the script and the consummate skill of the actors."
273,The Master,7,23 September 2012,There Will Be Cults,"Greetings again from the darkness. Critics seem to love it, while movie goers seem to be left grasping for meaning. This is director Paul Thomas Anderson's sixth film, and could be either his best or worst, depending on your tastes. What is clear, however, is that all the hoopla over this being an expose' of Scientology was for nothing. In fact, the cult/religion in the film plays second fiddle to a mentally unstable drifter who you will find no real interest in following (yet unable to take your eyes off).On the plus side, there are three terrific performances in the film. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a frightening, off beat character named Freddie Quell. Freddie suffers from PTSD after WWII and is some kind of freaky genius when it comes to moonshine and hooch. We see him utilize missile fuel, paint thinner, photographic chemicals, coconuts and Lysol. Never accept a drink from Freddie. Philip Seymour Hoffman is pure charisma and power as Lancaster Dodd, the character supposedly modeled on L Ron Hubbard, the writer and (some would say) con man who developed Scientology through Dianetics. Hoffman is fascinating to watch and totally believable as a guy who draws in the suckers. His staunchest follower is his ice queen wife played with quiet intensity by Amy Adams. This is quite a different role for her and she really delivers the goods.Joaquin Phoenix deserves a few words. His physicality here approaches deformity and his sexual perversion is clear early on thanks to a beach scene. Phoenix looks emaciated, and somehow inverts his shoulders and wears a constant grimace that would make Michael Shannon proud. Much of his performance reminded me of a young Marlon Brando ... high praise indeed.Though Scientology is never mentioned, the ""processing"" demonstrated certainly fits right in with the early methods. Still, the weakness of the movie stems from the story. Following Freddie leaves a gaping hole in substance. There's just not much to this broken man. On the other hand, we constantly want to know more about The Master, Lancaster Dodd.Technically, it's a stunning and beautiful movie. From an entertainment perspective, the second half might be downright boring and uninteresting. If not for the Oscar worthy performances and the stellar camera work and interesting camera angles, even more people probably would have walked out during the film. Jonny Greenwood is back (There Will Be Blood) with Anderson, and again delivers the perfect accompaniment. With some script work, this could have been a truly great film. Instead, we get ho-hum from a true auteur. (www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com)"
274,The Master,10,25 August 2013,A Significant Achievement in Film,"Religion is an enigmatic concept. While some experience organized faith as a source of vast spiritual relief, others are left to associate it with devastating amounts of pain and adversity. Filmmakers often attempt to tackle such difficult subject matter, but very few have been able to do so like Paul Thomas Anderson.Despite its near perfect cinematography and score, The Master is defined by the Academy Award nominated performances delivered by Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams. Of the three, Joaquin Phoenix's exceptional portrayal of Freddie Quell stands on a higher pedestal. Who is Freddie Quell? Aside from being an eccentric WWII veteran who fails to subdue his alcoholism and sexual urges, he is essentially no different than the average viewer. Freddie's undetermined future is one that can be mirrored by any troubled man or womanany lost soul that only hopes to be found. Finding solace in a cult-like organization, Freddie is taken in by none other than ""The Master"". Who is The Master? Informally known as Lancaster Dodd (and played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman), he is an individual who answers to no one (with exception to his wife, that is). Contrary to his perception, Lancaster Dodd is no prophet. He is many things: a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist, and a theoretical philosopher. But above all, Lancaster Dodd is a man, a hopelessly inquisitive man, just like you. The Master is a film that leaves you searching endlesslybut what for? Considering the numerous questions proposed by Anderson's 6th film, it is ultimately suggested that perhaps, they are to remain unanswered."
275,The Master,1,1 June 2013,Awful...simply awful.,"Three films have quite literally sent me to sleep; The Matrix, Stargate and...The Master.I found the film exceptionally dull and pointless, apart from some funny send-ups of Scientology I can't recommend anything about this movie, which is a real shame as I bought it because it was from the creator of Magnolia, one of the finest examples of cinema ever made.Of special note is the score which manages to be hypnotically boring and horrific-sounding at the same time.Here are five things you can watch in 132 minutes which are more exciting than watching The Master-1) Watch paint dry2) Watch somebody else watch paint dry 3) Watch the 'Copyright Warning' at the start of the DVD 1584 times4) Watch two-thirds of Magnolia5) Fall asleep and watch the insides of your eyelids An example of Laurel-sitting in extremis..."
276,The Master,2,16 May 2013,"So much talent, such fine performances, so very little to care about.","I watch movies and TV for, really, one reason: to be entertained, even if it's only for the duration of the program. With this motion picture, which features fine actors in excellent performances, I simply felt the life-force bleeding from me as I sat and watched and prayed something would happen. Nothing did. Apparently, I'm not intelligent or sophisticated enough to appreciate the depth of the story and artistry of the direction. But, bottom-line, a lousy movie is still a lousy movie, no matter how big the screen is. In this case, 55 inches of flat screen was filled with an even flatter motion-picture experience. You would do well not only to skip this one, but also to stay far, far away from it. And to be honest, my wife and I agreed about 40 minutes into it, that we could not endure whatever minutes were to follow. We don't care how it ends cause we didn't care how it started or what happened in between. Redbox can keep my $1.20, but I want my 40 minutes back."
277,The Master,2,8 May 2013,Pretentious Nonsense,"I was really looking forward to this flick. Im a huge Philip Seymore Hoffman fan and the cast/crew seemed promising. But like a previous reviewer (who generously gave a 3), this movie left a lot to be desired. i resent the fact that the academy and every other critic who jumps all over the jock of artsy films that carry No direction or purpose of story, but instead provide long drawn out scenes that apparently are supposed to convey depth and artistry, have unjustly held this movie up to be revered..Even if thats the type of movie you're looking for, don't waste 2.5 hrs on this one- (watch ""The Artist"" or some other choice.) Although the actors did a good job playing these strange characters (only reason this isn't a 1!), the screenplay and purpose of the film is baffling. Could've done so much more with the premise of a cult leader played by PSH with such a great supporting cast as the followers. Sadly Disappointing and shocked at the sheep who helped this get a +7 overall review here on IMDb"
278,The Master,1,28 April 2013,Disappointing.,"This is a plot-less film about an alcoholic drifter who gets mixed up with a delusional charlatan. Neither one changes. End of story.The principal actors were certainly of high caliber, but again I was reminded of another film. When Michael Cain was asked why he did Ashanti, he replied, ""for the money.""As I was trying to formulate some sort of deep review of this film I had a flash back to a scene from Hill Street Blues: In the squad room Howard Hunter, the priggish SWAT guy, announcing his thirst, opens the fridge and takes an apple juice bottle, opens it, takes a swig, and immediately spits it out, screaming, ""why don't people throw their spoiled food out!"" Time lapse, next scene, one of the other detectives goes to the fridge and exclaims, ""I have a doctor's appointment. Who's the smart ass who tossed my urine sample?""I'm not so young anymore and I've seen a lot of art in my life. When one of my daughters got her first job in a video store years ago, she asked me what sort of films should she watch to be a discerning viewer. I said to her to watch it all, and then you'll know what is good and what is crap.What is a mystery to me is why some people upon seeing an enigmatic, meandering piece of garbage feel they MUST find art in it. Trust your judgment: If looks like crap, the chances are that it is crap. Just because you hear hoof beats don't look for zebras, and don't blow a gasket looking for deeper meaning.I would file this one along with ""Limits of Control,"" in the trash can. Save yourself the 137 minutes and clean your bathroom instead."
279,The Master,10,10 April 2013,A Magnificent Film,"The Master is a film that features Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams that tells the story of Freddie Quell, a World War II veteran struggling to adjust to a post-war society who meets Lancaster Dodd , a leader of a religious movement known as ""The Cause,"" who sees something in Quell and accepts him into the movement. Freddie takes a liking to ""The Cause"" and begins traveling with Dodd along the East Coast to spread the teachings.It was written, directed, and co- produced by Paul Thomas Anderson.Freddie Quell is a sex-obsessed alcoholic World War II veteran struggling to adjust to a post-war society. He becomes a portrait photographer at a local department store but is soon fired for getting into a drunken fight with a customer. Freddie then finds work on a cabbage farm, but his moonshine poisons one of the elderly migrant workers and he is chased off.One night, intoxicated, Freddie stows away on the yacht of Lancaster Dodd, the leader of a philosophical movement known as ""The Cause"". When he is discovered, Dodd invites Freddie to stay and attend the marriage of Dodd's daughter, Elizabeth, as long as he will make more of his mysterious brew, which Dodd has developed a taste for. Dodd begins an exercise with Freddie called Processing, a flurry of disturbing psychological questioning aimed at conquering Freddie's past traumas. Freddie reveals that his father has died, his mother is institutionalized, he may have had an incestuous relationship with his aunt, and he abandoned the love of his life, a young girl named Doris, who wrote to him while he was at war. Freddie is enthralled by Dodd, who doesn't flinch from his abject revelations, and Dodd sees something in Freddie. Freddie travels with Dodd's family as they spread the teachings of ""The Cause"" along the East Coast, staying as guests in the homes of various women drawn to ""The Cause"".In the end it may not have the emotional uplift the Academy or a popular mainstream audience craves, but make no mistake, this is an enthralling drama about a peculiarly American restlessness, and the striving for insight and grace.It is a challenging film as it evokes insight and analysis from the view.Also,it is characterized by spellbinding performances of Phoenix,Hoffman and Adams.Overall,it is is challenging, perplexing, at times infuriating and always thoughtful. Truly a magnificent film and it is surely one of the best films produced during its year of release."
280,The Master,1,8 April 2013,Is this a dark comedy?,"There's plenty of well written reviews already posted here. I suggest you read 2 of the ones with lots of stars to see how great this movie is. Next read about 10 of the reviews with 1 or 2 stars. They all say pretty much the same thing: the movie is a bore. They are absolutely correct, but if you're at the theater with someone and can't walk out (and believe me, nothing interesting is ever going to happen), you can pass the time by simply watching Joaquin Phoenix rather than follow the story line. First the facial expressions. Is he really that good an actor or is that just him? (It's the 1st time I've seen him). Next look at his clothes and the way they fit on him. Combine this with the way he moves about in those clothes. It's hilarious."
281,The Master,1,4 April 2013,What's the point?,"I usually love Paul Thomas Anderson, but this film was pointless, meandering, and stupid. It was just some insane bum being manipulated by some control freaks. I don't get it. Am I supposed to gawk at the pretty pictures, Mr. Anderson? What the f*ck do I care about those if there's nothing of substance to think about? With Punch Drunk Love at least I could relate to the character. With this, I had no connection to him. He was a loser. They were all losers. Totally loathsome losers. Who wants to watch that? Maybe there's some grand idea motivating it that I'm not privy to? They invite him to England, saying they can cure him of his insanity once and for all, and then ask him why he came? How does that make sense? It was a waste of everyone's time. This whole thing was just a total waste. I can't help but wonder if Paul Thomas Anderson is slowly losing his mind. Or having some sort of existential crisis. He doesn't seem to know what he's doing anymore or why he's doing it. Maybe he never did."
282,The Master,1,25 March 2013,why?,"I really have to wonder why some movies are made. This one fits that category- unwatchable.Why the masturbation? I don't see the need. And the dirty talk... gimme a break Save yourself 2 hours of your life... I suppose the acting is OK but what for?I don't believe this was L Ron Hubbard's life, from what I've read. There is no point to this movie or this review but I need 10 lines of text I think your getting the picture by now.. I haven't read too many other reviews but they can't be great. What a waste of everybody's time."
283,The Master,1,23 March 2013,Waste of Space,"Huge letdown and then some. There was no point to this film whatsoever. No plot, a bunch of unresolved subplots and a soundtrack that hurts the ears. It was a waste of $32M and 9 months of the cast's time, as well as two hours of my own, plus another 10 minutes to write this review. The one redeeming quality of the Blu-ray is that it makes a great clay pigeon, or would if it didn't belong to Love Film. Please, please don't rent or buy this movie as it might encourage the director to make some more. Avoid like an STD. I've run out of things to say now, a bit like the film after the first ten seconds, but I'm going to carry on writing as IMDb requires a minimum of ten lines of text. Loads of padding. Just like the film."
284,The Master,10,8 March 2013,Who is the better alcoholic - Denzel or Joaquin?,"While both were nominated for best actor - Joaquin wins hands down for his harrowing, scary performance. He is definitely hardcore. The scene in the jail cell where he is handcuffed and pounding his head on the toilet is classic. It is scenes like this where he approaches the greatness of a young James Cagney. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are also deserving of their Oscar nominations. If Joaquin reminds me of James Cagney then Mr. Hoffman reminds me of Orson Welles without the weird singing bits. He has the gravitas of a great man with all the layers of a con man. If he wasn't so good at inventing a ""religion"" you could imagine him leading a life in politics kind of like William Jefferson Clinton & his Lady Macbeth."
285,The Master,4,3 March 2013,A film made for discord,"Everything is evident in the formula of fantastic film making. Yet the sum of which never quite equates to a fantastic film. There will always be a healthy level of discord associated with ""The Master"". I feel the phrase ""it's a bit of a Marmite sandwich"" is quite apt. Unfortunately for me I stand on the ""I hate it"" camp. I shouldn't yet I do. Cinematography - Outstanding. Soundtrack and score - Gripping and disturbing. Acting - Sensational. Direction - Exceptional. The film regularly and accurately portrays what the protagonist (Freddie Quell - Joaquin Phoenix) is experiencing and is a psychological masterpiece. Then Why the low mark I hear you ask? I simply didn't enjoy it. I'm tempted to say pretentious but I should probably put it down as being film making that's a little bit too intelligent for the likes of li'l ol' me!"
286,The Master,,21 September 2012,The acting is the thing.,"""He's making all this up as he goes along. You don't see that?"" Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master doesn't let you see ""that' clearly; nor is it clear that L. Ron Hubbard's scientological world is really the subject of this character study. What is apparent, for sure, is that Philip Seymour Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd is a brilliant leader with outré beliefs, and his henchman-acolyte Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is as much Caliban (The Tempest's rude beast man with aspirations) to Dodd's Prospero (The Tempest's magician ruler) as Tom Cruise with his couch antics is to Hubbard. Quell is Dodd's Frankenstein, a creation impossible to tame.Dodd is a 1950's faith-based leader espousing a philosophy denigrating science in favor of a theory that the earth, trillions of years old, is a repository for humans who contain many past lives with their attendant problems and traumas. Tame those debilitations and the world will be peaceful and disease free.The Master is not the most entertaining film of the year, but it is the most intellectually demanding with two of the most powerful performances of the year from Hoffman and Phoenix. Hoffman underplays the charisma of a cult leader, opting rather for a paternal approach that lets itself go rarely, for instance when he indulges in the drink concoction Quell makes for him. As the quote at the beginning of this review hints, some in his retinue question his authenticity.Phoenix's Quell is the opposite of Dodd: visceral, animal, and untamed. Having suffered the traumas of WWII, he is seeking meaning in his life after drifting aimlessly in an amoral life of excessive drinking and brutishness, best expressed when he masturbates on a female sand sculpture in front of a Pacific Beach crowd.The Master is another masterful production of Paul Thomas Anderson, whose There Will Be Blood had the same kind of off-center protagonist and whose Magnolia had a Scientology-related Tom Cruise, who must be pleased that Scientology got a pass in this film."
287,The Master,3,3 March 2013,Some nice performances....but I can see why this one lost money.,"""The Master"" is a film where a very messed up man, Freddie (Joaquin Phoenix), drifts through life after serving in WWII. He accidentally falls in with a very strange and charismatic man (Philip Seymour Hoffman)--a man who ultimately changes his life. Using a variety of brainwashing and hypnotic techniques (similar to the auditing done in Scientology), he manages to get very close to the Master--and becomes a very devoted disciple.""The Master"" is a film that the Academy loved (with three acting nominations), as did the professional film reviewers. However, the public stayed away and the film, at least according to IMDb estimates, was a total financial bust. And, after seeing the film, I could see why folks didn't go to see the film. Part of it surely was the subject matter--most people aren't particularly interested in a story about an L. Ron Hubbard-like guru leading a cult. Part of it is that the film isn't exactly family-friendly--with some VERY crude scenes (particularly at the beginning but they are sprinkled throughout). Most of it, however, is that the film is VERY, VERY slow, seemingly directionless and dull. Sure, the acting is nice, but I had a heck of a time sticking with this one. rather unpleasant film. And, while I normally love a longer film, in this case it was not an asset.It was interesting that Phoenix chose to do this film. I assume it might have to do with him growing up in a an organization often seen as a cult. Perhaps it was his way of dealing with this part of his past."
288,The Master,6,9 September 2012,"Good movie, but predictably liberal","Let me begin by saying that Hollywood managed to assemble the most extreme left-wing actors for this post-war drama, and the result - not surprisingly - is a bonanza of liberal ideas. I think one of the reviews said that the movie was not trying to make direct political statements. I find that laughable. I can definitely say that this movie is ALL about political messages, even though it's just fiction. The movie has the typical liberal commentary about war, capitalism, religion and the industrial revolution.As entertainment I actually think the movie itself was well-done. Phoenix puts in a good performance and the premise (a radical political leader coming to power in a post-war period) is well done. That makes it all the more upsetting when Hollywood tries to load it with left-wing messages.I think what annoys me most about these movies is that the underlying themes are so politically correct. The people making these movies have nothing new to say. Their commentary on society is old and uncompelling.Many of the directors in Hollywood were born in the sixties and they are still fighting their supposedly ""radical"" left-wing rebellion. Unfortunately, their ideas have become so mainstream that they are no longer radical. For the most part they are in the process of being rejected by a new generation. These directors need to get with the times."
289,The Master,9,23 September 2012,"Not an easy film, but a great one","A beautiful, fascinating, uncompromising and also difficult film. This is one where I can definitely understand viewers walking away feeling unsatisfied, and I definitely feel like I would have to see it at least once again to get close to understanding it. But I liked it myself, a lot. Joaquin Phoenix stars as a veteran of the Navy in 1950. He's kind of lost in the world, unable to hold down a job or connect to other human beings. One day, he jumps on a vessel going out to sea and meets up with Philip Seymour Hoffman, a charismatic author, doctor and philosopher who has a devoted throng of followers. Basically, it is Scientology, or at least based on it. This story doesn't have a lot to do with Scientology, though. The two men form a strong bond, but Phoenix is so self-destructive it begins to cause problems. There's not much in the way of plot here. It's mostly about this relationship, and it doesn't even particularly explore it in depth. It's more about the feeling of the relationship than it is an explanation of it. Whatever one's difficulties may be with the film itself, there's no doubt that Joaquin Phoenix just knocks it way out of the park. It's a physical performance that will remind you a lot of the central performance in PT Anderson's previous film, There Will Be Blood. And the character also reminds me a lot of the central character from Punch-Drunk Love (sometimes the film plays like a cross between those two films). Phoenix also reminds me a lot of the classic cartoon character Popeye, and if anyone's looking to do a gritty, live-action reboot, he's your actor. Hoffman is, of course, fantastic, as well, but it's really Phoenix's movie. The photography is gorgeous and I adored Johnny Greenwood's score (I thought his score for There Will Be Blood was a tad intrusive). Most certainly a must-see, even if it is divisive."
290,The Master,1,16 June 2013,A longer than you could ever possibly believe peer into a quite boring American living room.,"As a lot of people before us, 3 of us sat down to watch this ""modern masterpiece"" together, and after 30 minutes every one of us had complained it was quite slow going. After 1 hour we were moaning. For reasons none of us understood we followed it all the way through to the end and by that point we were literally complaining to the film itself in loud voices that it should hurry up and put us out of our misery.This is a jumble of characters with a promising premise, that fails utterly to utilise it in any way. I had at moments thought, well i thought i was a relatively intelligent person but i don't understand this, and then i realised there was really nothing to understand.The opportunities missed in this film are only surpassed by the excruciating long period of excessive boredom.For extra points they managed to make half of the dialog incomprehensible by saying it through a quite well acted semi paralysed face.I'm not joking, we were all begging for it to end, and all commented independently that this was the worse thing we have ever seen bar ""The Room"" and at least that was so bad it was funny."
291,The Master,1,21 March 2013,Amazingly bad,"I am a fan of all the actors in this movie. I often LIKE movies that are less than ""mainstream.""I even like some movies that most people seem to find quite bad. But not this one.Beautiful camera and lighting work. Moments for each of the main characters where you could SEE that the actors were working hard to get something across to the audience, and mostly succeeding.But the separate pieces just did not fit together well enough to equal their sum, never mind surpass it.This was just not a good movie, which really is too bad- so many good things went into it, including a pretty good concept.I actually watched the entire thing, start to finish, simply because I could not believe that with so many good people involved with the project it would .... never come together.Avoid this movie. You can't get the time back."
292,The Master,5,7 February 2013,Great Performances...Pretentious script,"Just finished watching The Master and I have to say I'm disappointed. I rated it a 5/10 because I thought the performances were excellent. I do think Hoffman deserves to win Best Supporting Actor and Phoenix is now my choice for Best Actor. Amy Adams, although not given much to do, is very good in her supporting role. The cinematography was also impressive. With that said, I found the script shallow and pointless. I am one of those who ask ""what was the point?"". As some have been mentioning, there was NO explanation as to why Master and Freddie needed each other. Sure, some are giving cockamamie, pseudo-intellectual explanations as to why but it really wasn't shown in the movie itself. At first, I thought Master needed Freddie to get rid of or beat up non-believers or people who were against The Cause but that didn't seem to be the case. Master just inexplicably wanted to ""reform"" Freddie and it was never shown why. On top of everything else, it was just a lifeless story of a disturbed man taken in by a cult leader with no payoff or anything remotely exciting happening."
293,The Master,6,4 February 2013,The odd ways to an Oscar,"The Master is a pointless movie, that's for sure. The only thing about it is the perfection of Joaquin Phoenix's ""Freddie Quell"" role. He's astonishing. My latest news from him were that he turned out to be the REAL Johnny Cash. So, I expected his Freddie Quell to be another of his charismatic roles, but I discovered far more. We face the best acting skills on 2012, along with Cristoph Waltz's ""Dr. King Schultz"" from Django Unchained. The always brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie is totally eclipsed by Phoenix's character. Freddie Quell's an animal. Literally. He reminded me a lot to the Great Ones like Marlon Brando. I think he's a good example of a method actor. He's chilling as Freddie Quell. Awesome acting, Joaquin. A consagratory gem from him as an actor.His deserving Oscar brilliancy is, of course, merged into The Master. A pseudo intellectual nothingness. I don't want to go against those who liked The Master, but I really don 't understand Anderson's ""filmic poetry"". The Master is the story of two guys who had one thing in common. They are pointless people. With pointless behaviours, in a slightly pointless world.I would approve the cinematography. Some colourful scenes and dressings provide some nice 50's ambiance. But this is not enough. There's no story to tell. Or if it is a story, is absolutely pointless. A cult charlatan (Hoffmann) and an alcoholic animal (Phoenix) who is taken under Hoffmann's wing to redeem himself. Imagine the results. In some other cases you would see redemption stories, even buddy comedies or worthy and memorable twists and turns. Well. This is not the case. It soon becomes dull.The Master is not a movie easy to follow, some of you will want to throw something to the screen (and with good reasons). But believe me, it worths the watch only for Phoenix and Hoffmann's high-standard roles. So it's a little weird to review a movie that I didn't like at all, but for the actor's sake, even with apparently no script, but with a good cinematography and better and above the average Oscar deserving roles, like Phoenix's Freddie Quell, is why I'm doing it. Probably the best Phoenix ever. It's a shame about the script. There's no subtle messages. The Master is pointless and a little pretentious. But I can't figure which are those pretensions. It has simply no point at all. It's a boring, boring and bizarre odd film. But those guys made me stay until the end. Cheers from Argentina."
294,The Master,4,28 October 2012,Emotion = no emotion?,"One adjective says it all: Creepy!This film makes it clear how close to the surface is total insanity. Violent insanity. Creepy!Phoenix does something quite creative, and I noted this in every scene that included him: He has his shoulders hunched forward, making him smaller, making him self protective. But also, if he were a hominid walking on all fours, his shoulders would be strained forward as if about to push off for a predatory (kill) leap to a prey. In this movie he was always, thus, about to pounce, predatory. Creepy!The soundtrack early on has a recording by Ella Fitzgerald, so perfect it leads us falsely down the path of expecting clarity and beauty. And a Jo Stafford track near the end does the same. I was unwilling to be tricked by those, like those following the master (note: all lowercase)."
295,The Master,6,27 September 2012,"Wonderful characterization, little to no plot","The actors, most notably Phoenix and Hoffman, explore their characters in thorough and compelling ways. While watching the film, you inevitably become impressed with their performances. The movie itself comes across like a mash of character shorts, but unlike shorts this film keeps going and probably shouldn't.As wonderful as Phoenix and Hoffman are, the film lacks anything resembling a point or a destination. I was hoping that maybe this was based on a true story and that Lancaster Dodd (played by Hoffman) would turn out to be a real man, which would lend some needed depth to the plot. However, I was disappointed to find out that this was not the case.When choosing to watch this movie, enjoy the above mentioned performances but save yourself some time and shut it off after about 45 minutes. You'll not only save yourself some time, but you'll avoid the inevitable disappointment that arises at the end when you realize there was no plot."
296,The Master,6,25 September 2012,"""The Master"" of an awe inspiring headache of a movie","Who could be a better student than Freddie Quell? This is one of many themes investigated by Paul Thomas Anderson's inspiring, ""The Master"". Aptly named, ""Quell"", is docile, impressionable and disillusioned. Our hero is supposed to be the ideal one, a war vet made up of cowboy heroics, pious servitude and James Dean Mythology, brilliantly captured by Joaquin Phoenix, his veneer is non-existent, someone of no form, no integrity, a man in desperate need of love, a drenched sponge, he's the lost and docile face of brilliant confusion in a film that doesn't quite do him justice, but tries to.We first meet Quell on an island with seamen, consummating with sand in the form of a giant woman. There's talk of post-traumatic stress disorder from a pragmatic Military psychologist. Once discharged, Quell wanders, drinks and picks fights like Charlies Bukowski's alcoholic, but he does it without any pleasure. His mission, it seems, is blind, and without novelty.Quell eventually stumbles onto a cult is led by a certain Lancaster Dodd, played by Hoffmann whose like Ned Beatty's omniscient character in ""Network"", but he's part lovable. Dodd is also occasionally brilliant, yet more often openly doubted by even his followers. His philosophy is partially that of ""processing"", a hypnotic type treatment meant to cure the experiences of lives long past. Quell is quickly a believer, which makes sense in an odd way, after all, the solutions of this life cannot console him, it is as if he needs the treatment of another world. How legitimate ""processing"" is in this world is left to interpretation, but it seems to make sense to our alien protagonist and we're never explained why. Our protagonist remains an enigma throughout. It's just not satisfying or engaging. This occult is obviously a commentary on Scientology as well. No one is allowed to question Dodd's philosophy. No one is allowed to leave and come back. Dodd is awe inspiring because he is also part monster. All of his philosophy's value is placed on the individuals past life, which gives him more control over the students ""current"" life. There is a lot to wonder about in this piece. It's more philosophy than story. For instance, half way through, I began to wonder if Anderson was commenting on modern psychologies ""over"" use of altering brain chemistry through medication instead of attempting to deal with personal trauma, but it's hard to tell in a film so laced in metaphor.From here, the focus becomes less on the philosophy and of a grander treatment itself. Intentionally or not, it becomes more and more difficult to relate to our heroes and it becomes harder for characters to relate to each other. The film captures two Oscar caliber performances that never really connect and what's more problematic is the way by which Anderson fails to develop what each character wants. Each character ends up dynamic, but the weight behind them is light. The supporting cast is even less effective. Amy Adams as the wife is a woman of fire and brimstone and Laura Dern is a nice surprise as a hesitant follower, but their characters, amongst others, do not equal in what becomes a chaotic equation, but one worth pondering. To be short, this work fails to seduce us like Anderson's ""Magnolia"" a film in which we experience many forms of life. With ""The Master"" we're pushed further and further away, until we're lost at sea without them."
297,The Master,1,12 April 2013,Not even worth illegally downloading,"This movie was so pointless and foul that your time would be far better spent watching your lawn grow. There is nothing redeeming in this movie. The story starts out with a sailor that drinks cocktails of coconut juice, turpentine, gasoline or anything else he can find that he hopes will get him plastered, sometimes it's actually liquor. Then it cuts to some sailors humping a lump of sand shaped like a woman and another quick shot of a different sailor masturbating on the beach.Well, now that you have the synopsis of the storyline it just dwells on random scenes of things in the same grotesque nature for the remainder of the movie.Just when you think the movie can't get worse it does. Hoffman starts singing some old folk song that has been long forgotten, perhaps some old drunken sailor's favorite that used to be sung in bars in distant island memoirs. Along with this dismal scene, there's a large group of drunken nude maidens young and old clapping along to his pathetic drunken bar tune of disgust.The movie is just a sad scene of a pathetic boring sailor that wants to drink himself to death. It's boring and painful to watch, you despair almost from the word go, it finally ends and you thank the powers of all creation, THE END!Go watch a deer take a SH|T instead of watching this movie. I promise it's more fun than watching the director of this movie do the same thing, except that the director does it for 2+ hours on the screen."
298,The Master,8,3 February 2013,"Brilliant photography, very good acting and nice direction","This film covers a man's (Phoenix) move into a movement, namely a cult, helmed by a charismatic and grandiose autocrat (Seymour Hoffman). The first thing that struck me about this film was the brilliant cinematography and near-Technicolor effect. Second, the film's far from all surface, despite of the superficial gimmicks: Phoenix being the rowdy, seemingly unintelligent follower to Seymour Hoffman's suave, manipulative leader, the controlled women, the obvious pokes at scientology, etc. As a whole, this is a film that treats the viewer as an intelligent being, capable of making its own decisions; there are few obvious lessons in morality here, thank Bog. Phoenix, true to his name, rises from the quasi-ashes of ""I'm Still Here"" to play wonderfully, quite possibly stealing the scene from Seymour Hoffman. The second half of the film lacks pace, but that still makes sense considering the tempo of Phoenix's journey. All in all: a highly recommendable gem that pairs 1950s film making with great acting, cinematography and direction."
299,The Master,10,2 February 2013,Is this Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece?,"I have been a P.T. Anderson fan for some years now, and for the past few years, I have been eagerly (and patiently might I add) been waiting for him to make another. Not only for him to make another, but for him to make another movie as great as 1999's Magnolia. So finally in 2012 he came out from his cave and made The Master. Being a 16 year old who lives in Georgetown, In is hard if you love movies. Because movies like this don't show up very often around here (it was only in theatres for a week). But now I have finally seen it. And I have to say that it was well worth the wait.Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of his career as a disturbed soldier named Freddie Quell. Quell has just gotten out of the Navy, and his having a hard time recovering from the war. But then comes an intellectual named Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, an Anderson alumni, who gives one of his best performances here), who sees a tortured soul in Freddie, and decides to take him under his wing. Dodd is a leader of The Cause, which is some sort of weird Scientology-type religion. Amy Adams is marvelous as Dodd's wife, Peggy, who is sort of freaked out by Freddie. Could you blame her?Anderson's films, at the root of it, are about men. Different types of men. Greedy (There Will Be Blood, Boogie Nights), intellectual (Magnolia, this one), and disturbed (this one, and Punch Drunk Love). Anderson's films have taken a strange turn since Magnolia, and though I loved Punch Drunk Love and There Will Be Blood, neither of them have quite lived up to Magnolia or Boogie Nights. Until this one.The Master is beautiful. It's a lot to take in, and Phoenix will creep the hell out of you. But it's an extraordinary film achievement. I won't know how much I really love it until I watch it a few more times. That was the case with Magnolia.I saw it once and loved it. But then I saw it again and again and I became addicted to it. And it will be the case with this one too.I tried to figure out what could be so confusing about this movie. Yes it's weird, but is that really it? I read that you love it more within repeated viewings, and I'm sure that's the case, but there was nothing wrong with it the first time. The cinematography is gorgeous, the performances are unforgettable (Daniel Day Lewis and Joaquin Phoenix are thumb-wrestling for my vote), and it's easily the years most fascinating movie.But now we must ask ourselves one question: Is this as good as Magnolia or Boogie Nights? I have no clue. I need to see it a few more times. I could watch it over and over again so it might not take much to persuade me. This is one of the year's best.A+"
300,The Master,9,14 October 2012,Mommy's Boy,"Ultimately, The Master is about a good little boy, Dodd, who wants to be a bad little boy like Freddie. The steely Mrs Dodd, who has ambition enough for all, makes sure it will never happen. When Dodd sings the poignant Slow Boat to China in their last scene together, he means ""alone"" as in, without MRS DODD! SHE is the Master Dodd longs to flee but cannot, and Freddie walks off, same as he entered-- flawed, freaky and unfettered. That being 'solved,' watching these two actors is a joy-- Hoffman and Phoenix are BOTH MASTERS. The masturbation scene is beyond disturbing, with this movie as rife as it is with mother-son references. The naked women-- did Freddie dream them or did Dodd? Doesn't matter, Dodd isn't getting any. As Mrs Castorini says to the professor in Moonstruck, ""You're a little boy, and and you want to be bad."" Done deal, pal. Done deal."
301,The Master,6,13 October 2012,Strong Character-Driven Film That Wandered,"The Master features the strong performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Scene by scene, the viewer has plenty to see, and most of the film is compelling, but it leads to an unsatisfying conclusion. There was more story to tell. The film was more or less about the founder of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, and maybe it was. But we do not really learn much about the mysterious founder of the cult. The Master controls an unspecified number of people through hypnosis. He alludes to souls traversing the universe and taking up residence in human vessels. He alludes to trillions of years of struggle between good and evil, but those allusions are not detailed enough to amount to defense of a spiritual doctrine. But Hoffman's character is controlled his spouse played by Amy Adams. We don't know why or how she has such control over the master. There are a few scenes suggesting that The Master takes dictation from his wife, rather than authoring his books. Hubbard himself was a prolific science fiction writer, and the claim that he is not the true author probably deserved a little more attention.There are moments when the group behaves like a cult. There is a paranoid concern that outsiders have penetrated the inner circle, but those concerns do not become malignant or dangerous. There are also moments where Hoffman appears to be a magician performing parlor tricks. While Hoffman's character has his moments, he is never really triumphantly powerful or in command of his followers. Strangely, he sings and dances in an untalented way for his retainers, thus holding their attention through entertainment rather than mind control.The Master is a complex character who, for some reason, is committed to healing a very broken soul in Freddie Quell (Phoenix,) an alcoholic World War II veteran who suffers from PTSD. Most of this film is about elaborate attempts to make him ""better.""Though driven by strong characters in Hoffman and Phoenix (and excellent, powerful acting by both), the film ends up in a different setting, but really the same place, without much change in the players. The characters demonstrate little arc, and while we witness intense interpersonal psycho-dynamics, the characters are not much changed by intensity of their relationship. So it leaves us wondering what the journey was about. The film isn't plot less, but the story fades away leaving us wondering what more wasn't told."
302,The Master,6,29 September 2012,Character Study Is Not an Adventure,"This is one of those films, just based upon the length of exposure to the characters, that stays in your head afterward. It takes extended takes of close-ups to absorb the mind of Freddie Quell and Lancaster Dodd. The modern mind cannot fathom attitudes and norms from 60 years ago. By stripping out most essential dialogue or other details surrounding the main characters, we can concentrate on seeing through the eyes of these characters. You can anticipate the setup, an alcoholic who is just looking for his next high, meeting a healer who is on an ego trip. The film finds commonality in the two characters, by exploring their friendship. Freddie Quell is painted as the devil, as heard by song during one of his scenes early in the film, and even his name (Freddie Krueger ring a bell?). He acts on his animal instincts, and never achieves any great heights in intellectualism. Through proper medical practices, and perhaps Alcoholics Anonymous, personal problems can be addressed with therapy. This film depicts the healer using unorthodox methods appealing more to socialites than chemically dependent individuals. The film brings the two characters together, not as much Doctor/Patient, but Drinking Buddies. Through the personal ramblings of Lancaster to Freddie, we see his frame of mind in his sense of self-importance. I am reluctant to go into evaluation of this character in relation to L. Ron Hubbard. I don't enough about the man and his past to view the movie through that prism. Instead, having interest in psychology on my own, I evaluate his practices in compared to other known practices. I myself have tried experimental healing methods very briefly, but never anything resembling an occult. This movie does not portray his operation as a cult. I view a cult as people who cling to more extreme views and look at disdain upon others. Although there are some scenes of confrontation, the director wisely prevents the film from falling into a cliché trap. More cult leader characteristics can be seen through the actions of Lancaster's wife, but she does not dominate the film. In fact, the film is not dominated by Lancaster Dodd, but by Joaquin Phoenix, still in Johnny Cash mode, as Freddie Quell. His unbalanced life is captivating, creating tension whenever he is on the screen. His dangerous mind overwhelms any situation, and keeps the attention on him. Whether his character was meant as a foil for the controversial healer, even as a caricature of the devil, it is much more than that. Only the great Jack Nicholson comes to mind as someone as intriguing as him. Phoenix will definitely earn an Oscar nomination for this performance. I found the audience watching this film fidgeting at the 2 hour 30 minute runtime. Such character studies need a slower pace than regular movies to penetrate into the minds of characters. Paul Thomas Anderson's previous film ""There Will Be Blood"" (read my review), was a similar character study. Albeit that film had greater scope and was more of an adventure, as we watched the building of an oil business. In ""The Master"" the scope is deliberately narrowed, and there are no fireworks along the way. We sit in sessions with Lancaster and Freddie. And we, along with Freddie, try to figure out if his type of therapy really works. It is still worth sitting through, because the strength of these characters will not likely beat anything else this year (except perhaps Daniel-Day Lewis in ""Lincoln""?)."
303,The Master,6,24 September 2012,"A letdown comparable to The Tree of Life, but not a total loss","There I was, sitting in the theater. The Master, the film I had waited what seemed like an eternity for, had just ended, seemingly out of nowhere. I was blank faced. I sat silent for a good five seconds before memories of my experience with The Tree of Life came hurtling back to me. I had been slapped in the face again. Slapped by another movie with a trailer so awe-inspiring I nearly shat while watching it. So, in my critique of this trailer I will begin there; the trailer.These days, there is a consistent lack of movie trailers which make you bleed with excitement. (This is of course discounting movies by your favorite director/actor). But the master succeeded in every possible way that a trailer can. The music. Intense. It rose, almost hauntingly, in a slow crescendo which seemed to foreshadow the eventual explosion of whatever sickness lived inside Joaquin Phoenix. The cast, and what acting we were shown, was excellent, and the trailer did not dare give away anything too important. It was beautifully shot and and seemed to hide something very deep and striking. Also, the title is just amazing, but that's besides the point. All of these things combined led me to the conclusion that this movie, at worst, would be very good. I was wrong, but the worst thing about it is that the movie did not show me I was wrong until it's final minutes.The movie began beautifully and I had a laugh or two within the first few minutes which is always a good sign. I was feeling good. ""Yes, it WILL be everything I thought it could be"". The movie continued with characters intermittently introduced (with, for whatever reason, included a mass of montages accompanied by a great soundtrack) in what seemed like it was going to be a nicely crafted character study. Again, I was still loving this movie halfway through. It seemed to breakthrough every achievement barrier I had set for it. And so the movie continued and I continued to enjoy it. As with most movies, I was actively attempting to figure out the ending during the duration of the film. My attempts came to a futile end when the film concluded, and what was left was a shockingly disappointing lack of an ending. The movie had been going so strong. I was, for the most part, immersed in the character of Joaquin Phoenix (whose acting, along with the soundtrack, should be the sole reasons to see this is film. This movie is NOT incredible in the way There Will be Blood is. It is not even in the same ballpark.) and it was hard to look away from such a beautiful film. But when the movie ended there was nothing. Joaquin, whose character was in a way ""in development"" under the tutelage of Phillip Seymour Hoffman throughout the entire film, seemed to not have changed at all. Perhaps this was the point of the film. A look one chapter of a man's life either unwilling or unable to change. A movie whose story seemed mastered (lol) while i was watching it, was immediately unraveled upon the end of the film. Seriously, with a more satisfying ending, this movie could have been incredible. But I cannot accept what I was shown. If this movie was a 40 page contract, I would have torn it up on reading the last sentence. That is how seriously I feel the film was impacted by the ending. It was pretentious. And the reason I say pretentious is that it did not deliver on what a film is supposed to deliver on. As unfortunate as some directors might find it, I feel hat movies are NOT for them, they are for us. The viewing audience. And, yes, I can see how some people maybe found this movie ""genius"" or some BS like that, or how PTA could have finished and thought, ""perfect"". But he did not let us, the audience, in on everything. We were kept in the dark about a movie which, looking back, seems like a pet project now. He made the movie for himself. Whatever PTA was thinking when he finished the movie the way he did, was hidden from the audience. We were told nothing. There was an air of indifference as the movie ended. We were robbed of a finished story, and as a result I cannot respect the movie as a whole. Without some sort of ending or even a reasonable climax, the whole story is lost. I honest to god would have been more satisfied if, following the second super pretentious fade-in of the title at the end of the movie, they put something up like ""ten years later, so and so was arrested for blah blah blah"". At least it would have been a conclusion. This is the reason why Steven Spielberg i consistently considered the best director in the biz, though I tend to disagree. Spielberg makes his movies FOR THE AUDIENCE. You never walk out of a Spielberg movie confused, and rarely unsatisfied. All in all, I apologize for the rant, but I really really really wanted this movie to be good, and I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I was given a movie which seemed to be missing about 8 hours of footage and which gave me post-film feeling eerily similar to those I felt during The Tree of Life. However, I was also given a gorgeous soundtrack and some terrific ending. So, I am in no way telling you to stay away from this movie, although I would like to believe you will walk out of the theaters with feeling similar to mine. Go see the movie and decide yourself, because at the very least you get to see the glorious return of the Joaquin Phoenix form the ashes!P.S. This movie is more a 6.7 than a 6."
304,The Master,8,23 September 2012,"Beautiful, but ultimately hollow","I'm honestly incredibly torn about this movie. It is absolutely stunning to watch in terms of the cinematography and the acting is fantastic. However, there some irreconcilable faults in terms of an incredibly disappointing and 'feh' ending, as well as an unsatisfied feel toward the end. It is vague, which works both as an advantage and as a hindrance. It does bring up fascinating ideas and psychological challenges, but ultimately it desperately needs higher stakes than those of the curious mind.Ultimately the movie was told very well and very beautifully, but the lackluster story didn't deserve it."
305,The Master,9,22 September 2017,One of the Greats,"I feel like this movie will become more appreciated over time. In my opinion Joaquin Phoenix and Seymour Hoffman give two of the greatest performances i have ever seen- the complexity of both characters and their relationship really being the centre of the film. Although it takes a while to get off the ground, if you're interested in character heavy drama, this is a must see."
306,The Master,10,22 July 2017,A masterpiece,"My favourite film of 2012 ... probably my favourite film of the decade. It's nominally the story of two men who appear quite different on the surface, but are really strikingly similar. Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd is attracted to Phoenix's Freddy Quell because they have the same ferocious, restless anger, and unlike Dodd, Quell has no desire to be restrained. Quell is attracted to Dodd because Dodd manages to get inside Quell and get him to reveal himself ... Quell is convinced Dodd's religion must have some answers. More than this, it's a meticulous recreation of the style of classical Hollywood melodramas, both in the look and in the extraordinarily controlled performances Anderson gets from his cast, but without feeling like a slavish reproduction. It's both strikingly modern and classical in style ... an extension of Anderson's work on ""There Will Be Blood""."
307,The Master,8,28 June 2015,Philip Seymour Hoffman is The Master,"Can a film that's not a horror still be absolutely terrifying? Yes indeed it can. Within itself, the control the character of Lancaster Dodd exerts on his flock is quite terrible, but then you realise that this is not just something that happens in films! If you're interested in the nuts and bolts of filmmaking, Paul Thomas Anderson and cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr are on top form. Writing? Anderson is on fire once again. Jonny Greenwood proves he's the most interesting member of Radiohead with another excellent soundtrack but stealing the show are the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Verdict: You want to see this film. You want to see this film. Repeat after meyetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com"
308,The Master,9,5 May 2015,The controversy of character study within The Master,"The Master hit the box office to very controversial response. You might expect this has to do with the controversial topics the master discusses. The Master, on it's surface levels, is a snapshot of the rise of the Scientology movement: perhaps the most controversial movement of it's type. And believe me, after watching Going Clear for the first time last week, I can tell you that Lancaster Dodd resembles L Ron Hubbard in everything but name. Many critics and fans alike were unable to see past this resemblance, but were disappointed in the film's lack of ""opinion of "" or ""commentary on"" Scientology and it's followers. Now, movies about controversy are all too often too caught up in agenda to be thought provoking. Scriptwriters and producers alike so often find motivation in either personal or public beliefs about one side or the other. However, as you watch the movie's ambivalence towards it's subject matter grow, the controversy takes on new identity.The Master is about Scientology, yes. However, this shell of resemblance only acts as staging ground for the deeper purposes of the film. Namely, a cast of characters that upon analysis, explore what it means to be a ""Master,"" and whether man is master of his own fate. In the film, Joaquin Phoenix's character, Freddie, turns to Dodd's cult as a means of finding direction for his otherwise chaotic and hopeless life. Inversely, Dodd finds invigoration in Freddie's chaotic nature, which puts him in tension with Amy Adam's orderly and manipulative Mrs. Dodd. (Not unlike the Freudian struggle between the Id and Superego) At it's core, The Master is a character study, not a commentary on Scientology or any of the other ideas the movie explores. Instead of the themes and plot giving way for character development, the exploration of the characters the creates plot and themes alike. This is not necessarily a common trend in Western films, and certainly not modern blockbusters. Without understanding that, it is easy to mistake much of the film's content barren, and the finer points as extraneous. Paul Thomas Anderson is willing to draw out the plot, add slow scenes, and delay plot progression in order to fully bring his characters to life. Every scene, from the initial Processing session to the final scene on the beach, is drawn out as proportionate to it's significance to the characters involved. While this may be jarring out of context, it's immediately appropriate when you view the movie as an exploration of the characters. In order to appreciate the film for what it is, it's important to see the plot and pacing as serving character development, and not vice versa. Once you shift your perspective, the extraneous scenes become increasingly appropriate, and the movie's themes grow deeper and more complex. With this duality of perspective being so crucial to understanding the film, it's no wonder it's controversial."
309,The Master,4,7 August 2014,"If you're a ""There Will Be Blood"" fan, you'll probably like this","I (stupidly) went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the fact that Philip Seymour-Hoffman was in it, and I'd watch that man eat lunch. If I had known it was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson I MAY have passed as I completely didn't get the critical acclaim for ""There Will Be Blood"" either, but I think that comes down to personal taste. I also can't stand Stanley Kubrick movies who I feel is Anderson's closest analogue. I am aware that I am lonely in this opinion, but give me the Coen brothers or Tarantino any time. Anyway, this movie goes nowhere. It's like you took a movie with a great plot, fascinating character growth and mind-popping acting, then cut out various bits of it and just added a whole bunch of B-roll footage to pad out the missing parts. It jumps around like a waking dream, I'm guessing to try to connect you to the broken psyche of the lead protagonist, but in my case at least this just made it ultimately unrewarding and ungodly boring."
310,The Master,8,26 October 2013,He's making all of this up as he goes along. You don't see that?,"Paul Thomas Anderson's film supposedly about L. Ron Hubbard features Oscar-worthy performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Joaquin Phoenix, and Amy Adams.Set in the conformist 50s, the film sets a clash between that culture and the nonconformists rising.The exchange between the Master and the barely literate alcoholic drifter is what makes the film special. In these interactions, we examine our own spirituality and faith.Anderson presents a skilled blend of outstanding photography, music, and acting in this fascinating study of human character."
311,The Master,6,11 July 2013,"Not what I expected, which can often be a good thing...","...but this is one of those much-ballyhooed P. T. ""Boogie Nights"" Anderson films that I won't likely be going back to, despite bravura performances by two of my favorite actors, Joaquin ""To Die For"" Phoenix and Phillip Seymour ""Leap of Faith"" Hoffman and very able support from the likes of Amy ""Enchanted"" Adams. Anderson is at the top of his game technically, but a wee bit too self-indulgent in the writing department to elevate this piece past the watch-once level, and that's a shame, because mostly I've loved his movies. Maybe I'll give it another shot somewhere down the line, but it won't be any time soon; there are simply too many other titles to enjoy to waste time giving this one a second chance.The complaints I see on this site mirror my own, mostly the sad observation that neither one of the central characters is likable enough to really care what happens to them, and neither one of them really changes all that much to be of lasting interest.Your mileage may, of course, vary. I'm not saying it's a bad film; it's not. It just isn't anywhere close to being worthy of its title."
312,The Master,8,17 April 2013,A Great Warning *Spoiler*,"After seeing this film, I have seen the role of ""The Master"" being played and trying to work its way into my life about three times. This film is just the right antidote for dealing with such types of people or ""Causes"". I am glad I watched it. Now flags will raise whenever I see1. Nonsensical connections drawn 2. Charisma being put to use chiefly to sound intelligent 3. Exercises of ""THINK FAST AND LISTEN TO THIS QUESTION"" 4. Exercises of ""think long and hard and understand this nonsense"" 5. The list goes on...All main roles in the film were played perfectly, with Joaquin Phoenix doing his usual ""getting so into the role it's scary"" and Seymour Hoffman doing a phenomenal job of being charismatic."
313,The Master,9,4 April 2013,a film about striving to connect,"The underlying theme which powers the film is the striving to connect -to earlier lives and other's lives. Both heroes are alone in similar senses. The mystic is not loved even by his son. We see no real relation between him and his family. In fact, he does not have an intimate dialog with any family member throughout the film. The plot gets a bit off-focus making the film less than a masterpiece (""poison"" concept, sailor's over-aggressive behavior,...) but still it is more subtle in it's expression of loneliness than ""There Will Be Blood"" which portrayed a soul-less over-cold father. The last part starting with the movie theater scene is especially powerful."
314,The Master,,15 March 2013,A magnificent trio,"In the first half-hour of the movie, we follow the derelict path of somewhat (we don't know for sure) shellshocked post-WWII navy veteran Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) through his clueless existence during the war, shrink sessions upon discharging, and futile attempts to resume a normal life by taking a job as a photographer (family portraits and such). One of his key problems is ""boozing"" (a term freely used on him later in the movie). Ironically, because of his skill in mixing unique drinks (from and assortment of ingredients such as warship fuel, paint thinner.you don't really want to know), he catches the attention of one Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who welcomes him aboard (literally) to join his ""Cause"".Dodd is something else. With his family, disciples and followers, his mission is to preach (word used in a very general sense) the Cause, of which we first hear about at the celebration dinner of his daughter's (probably from an ex-wife) wedding  ""Marriage, previous to the Cause, was awful"" is how opens his speech. Gradually throughout the movie, we are privy to more, and our understanding of the Cause depends on our own perspective: quasi-science, quasi-religion, therapy, mysticism, or plain hocus-pocus. Take your choice.The focus of the movie is on the tantalizing relationship between these two characters polarized between success and failure, confidence and confusion, well-loved and friendless. They may as well be the proton and the electron. But then we know that it needs a neutron to complete an atom and hence my summary line. This is Dodd's wife Peggy (Amy Adams), who is as close to perfection as you can ever get, always supporting her husbands in furthering the Cause. Her own devotion is so fierce that it's frightening. So is her determination in everything she does. Sensing that her husband may be seeking alternative relief while she is pregnant, she single-handedly (very literally) brings him to an orgasm while whispering in his ear ""Come only for me"", all these while he is standing in front of the bathroom mirror washing his face.To give more details on the plot would only spoil the fun in watching. Suffices to say that watching the superb acting of the ""trio"" alone is such a riveting and mesmerizing experience. But then, there is also an excellent, good-sized support cast including Laura Dern who is probably still best remember by many from Jaurassic Park."
315,The Master,7,3 March 2013,Great acting.....message?,"The acting prowess of the trio of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Joachim Phoenix, and Amy Adams that made this worth-while for viewers. Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" is fabulously well-acted and crafted--no question, but it's the material that is not clear. It has two performances of Oscar caliber, but how do they connect? ""The Master"" won't likely impress the audience of his earlier masterstroke. A film that starts off seeming like the best of 2012 slowly becomes a chore to sit through. It didn't have to be that way. The things that are lacking in ""The Master""--are those any good screenwriter could have fixed. Alas, Anderson wrote this one himself.Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a soldier back from the Second World War who's finding it hard to adjust back to society, given his violent tendencies and is usually in a floating world of his own, fueled by his own deadly mix and concoction of any liquids he can find to develop into bootleg alcohol. In his drunken stupor one day he stumbles upon the boat full of followers of The Cause, and as a stowaway gets to meet the charismatic Cause leader Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), who decides to take him under his wing, with Freddie's ability to conjure up some of his magic juice a plus to have around the community. It's a toss-up as to what Freddie requires most - a master, a sponsor, or a shrink - and Dodd vacillates between all these roles when he takes Freddie on as a pet cause. For the next half hour, the film explores the odd bond that develops between this brilliant, articulate master manipulator and this confused, tongue-tied grifter. The Animated the first half hour soon slows down-- and then--sooner than later, grinds to a halt as ""The Master"" becomes a series of episodes. Just scenes from life inside a burgeoning cult-like organization.If you're hoping for insights into Scientology, or some kind of expose, there are none to be had. The movie's focus remains on those two men, Freddie and the Master, but there's really very little to explore there, and so the movie, ever so slowly and yet ever so definitely, begins to sag and then cave in. What made this film compelling to watch despite its scenes that seem to linger in indulgence--and requiring patience to sit through scores of repetition--are the powerhouse performances. Ultimately it's a plain sailing affair, with only its great performances to thank and shore up what's lacking in strength of story. ""The Master"" is a film that is too vague or compelling about it's Cause."
316,The Master,5,6 January 2013,A Nutshell Review: The Master,"Nothing sells a film more than controversy, and The Master had no lack of one, with its parallels drawn toward Scientology with its premise where a cult like leader is in the early stages of establishing his religion based on scientific fantasy of sorts, and the methods used that calls for true faith amongst his believers. Paul Thomas Anderson crafts a film that takes a while to get used to given its thematic focus on the none too pleasant, ranging from violence to the hallucinatory, and it is only the acting prowess of the trio of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Joachim Phoenix and Amy Adams that made this tolerable for what it wanted to convey.Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a soldier back from the Second World War who's finding it hard to adjust back to society, given his violent tendencies and is usually in a floating world of his own, fueled by his own deadly mix and concoction of any liquids he can find to develop into bootleg alcohol. In his drunken stupor one day he stumbles upon the boat full of followers of The Cause, and as a stowaway gets to meet the charismatic Cause leader Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), who decides to take him under his wing, with Freddie's ability to conjure up some of his magic juice a plus to have around the community.Call it trying to recruit a follower, or finding a friend with whom you can click instantly with, the two begins a topsy turvy relationship built upon mutual trust, and Freddie's occasional bouts of violence toward anyone who challenges Lancaster's authority over his sermons. It's an extreme form of bromance that doesn't sit well with Lancaster's pregnant wife Peggy (Amy Adams), who deem Freddie as an unforeseen destructive force that threatens to derail the good work they have put in developing their brand of teaching and legion of followers. And unknowing to all, Freddie is also that corrupting force that reveals the hypocrisy amongst the Dodd family, with the recently married Elizabeth (Ambyr Childers), daughter of Lancaster, also finding seductively irresistible.Paul Thomas Anderson's film reportedly had issues with members of Scientology for a crucial scene and line uttered in the film, and undoubtedly the parallels here, such as the beginnings and philosophy shared by its charismatic leader, Processing versus Auditing, would generate interest to come watch the film. The offense also extended toward suggestions that the rich, having enough to put them on top of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, seem to want to fulfill something empty inside them, and therefore more susceptible to swindlers and cons who offer that doorway to spiritual nirvana. The narrative involves embarking on an eyewitness journey together with Freddie when he got taken under the wings of the Dodd family and their extended supporters, from ship to land, to the abodes of its rich backers.What made this film compelling to watch despite its scenes that seem to linger in indulgence, and requiring patience to sit through scores of repetition, are the powerhouse performances, and that's it. It deals with the symbiotic relationship between an alcoholic man suffering from post war trauma and that of a cult leader and his influence and power, which in a way threatens the make up of the Dodd family. It talks about the power of cult and the cult leader, which Philip Seymour Hoffman aces with his sheer gravitas and presence on screen, delivering countless of seductive points even though they sound warped to begin with, and provided a clear contrast when his Lancaster is in private and public. While Freddie may be the more explosive one, Lancaster holds his own hair-drying effect when the need calls for it, with a short fuse threatening to blow each time his authority comes under fire in which he has no proper answer for. These are scenes that allowed Hoffman to fly off the handle, in between keeping his composure especially when needing the tranquility to sell his ideas across.Freddie becomes the third party between Lancaster and Peggy, the latter who sees her power behind her man waned and undermined, when she experiences being threatened by Freddie's introduction. I actually found this dynamics between Joachim Phoenix and Amy Adams and their characters a lot more interesting in their power struggle. Phoenix seemed to be sleepwalking through his role as the perpetually stoned army discharge, and seem to light up each time he gets to pulverize someone, in between being used as a guinea pig for Lancaster's experiments and teachings. His character's journey is the one the audience undertakes, and being an unpleasant character, makes the journey a little bit unsettling. Amy Adams, while limited in scenes, epitomizes what it means when being under a perceived threat, with one of her best scenes involved engaging the two men one after another for separate purposes.Production values are high, with effort taken to make this really like the 50s, although like Les Miserables it had its fair share of facial close ups of the actors. The score seemed really muted though, with nothing memorably standing out. The Master is a film that one would either love, or really dislike, because one may have expectations going to this, but the ending will really deflate all those high expectations of something more grandeur. The story is pretty straightforward, often times seemingly being stuck and unable to move along, and we're taken on that same ride and put on the same boat, experiencing and feeling the same level of frustration the protagonist feels. Ultimately it's a plain sailing affair, with only its good performances to thank and shore up what's lacking in strength of story."
317,The Master,6,26 September 2012,"Masterful acting, but not so much in pure storytelling.","It has been five years since we witnessed Daniel Day-Lewis put on a clinic about on-screen intensity (while also creating a short-lived internet meme about drinking everyone's milkshake). That was in the last film from critically acclaimed director Paul Thomas Anderson, who burst into the Hollywood spotlight with Boogie Nights, (which he followed up by the epic oddity of Magnolia and dark humor of Punch-Drunk Love). While Anderson's movies have a tendency to elicit extreme reactions from viewers  both positive and negative in equal amounts  it is never in question whether you will get something worth talking about. If there is a genre for coffee-table, quiet café discussion directors, Anderson would reign over it as its modern-day king.Anderson's newest project is The Master follows Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a perpetual drunk with no direction in life who literally stumbles into the calm clutches of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Dodd is a new-age cult leader who sees something in Freddie worth molding and sculpting. Dodd turns Freddie Quell into his prodigy with mixed results, often creating a battle not only between Quell's lightning-quick rage and his sanity, but also between Dodd and his own followers. It all intensifies as Dodd's following grows ever larger but more skeptical about whether what the man preaches is real or just a story he lost the thread to years ago.The real impact of the film comes from the performances. Anderson, in my eyes, has been an actor's director from day one. He is someone who will create amazingly beautiful and poignant scenes where these brilliant moments can live and breathe. Once you add in a cast of extremely talented actors, as exists in The Master, you know what you are about to experience is worth the ticket price.Hoffman and Phoenix put on a virtual master class in acting. It feels like a piece of prime theater, paced with precision and directed with wonderful simplicity. Phoenix reportedly studied caged animals at the zoo in order to bring that physical quality to Quell's nervous posture. It has worked wonders for him because there are only rare moments when you aren't holding your breath waiting for him to explode. Hoffman also displays the potential for violence, but it is handled with much more grace and charm. He brings forth a man with a world of his own creation on his shoulders, beaming with pride, yet weakened by the weight of it all.My main issue with the film didn't appear until after I had finished watching it and I began to wonder what the story really was about. What was the point of it all? Was there a message in the madness of Quell or the mastery of Dodd? People can easily debate this, but it feels as if Quell makes no real change from the beginning to the end. Dodd surely changes, at least in his circumstances, but it's not completely clear if changes occur in any other way to him or Quell.In the end, it is amazingly portrayed, but woefully told."
318,The Master,5,24 September 2012,"Yet another ambitious, mostly mediocre, occasionally excellent Paul Thomas Anderson picture","Exact rating: 5.5First a technical comment. I saw this projected in 70mm and although this is a gorgeous format, the sharp definition is often squandered by the shallow depth of field-- out of focus 70mm is not very different from out of focus 35mm. Still, it looks great, but often just felt like 35mm, despite the effort and cost of shooting 70mm.The core problems of this piece are problems of most Paul Thomas Anderson work. It works sometimes as allegory and cinematic diorama, but infrequently as drama. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is neither beguiling nor charismatic, the way this role requires. (Compare the various Hoffman speeches to any scene with John Hawkes in the far, far, far superior cult picture, Martha Marcy May Marlene.) From the beginning, we see Hoffman as quick to anger and a cold manipulator and there is no element of seduction in terms of bringing Joaquin Phoenix, and the audience, into the cult. Joaquin is neither charismatic nor very interesting, unless you find a mediocre love interest and drinking interesting.Both actors overdo it and get quite theatrical, though nothing like the abhorrent mugging and apoplectic histrionics of Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Maximum acting and method actor anger (the jail scene and singing bits are quite forced). I can engage in a movie with unlikable characters that are interesting, but these characters are neither and the actors do not bring enough personality to the roles to overcome the limitations of the script. Their relationship does not really work, and it's supposed to be a pillar of the movie--- see the failed melodrama at the end.Like the excellent opening sequences of There Will Be Blood and the Tom Cruise stuff in Magnolia, The Master has about 20+ minutes of material that is truly noteworthy--- the processing sequences. The drama and intensity of these scenes crackle vibrantly in comparison to the other sort of engaging two hours, which plays out like a vague biopic sans pathos. With the exception of the processing scenes and the overwrought acting, the overall piece is mild and less interesting than its subject."
319,The Master,6,21 September 2012,"Fascinating, yet personally unsatisfying","From the first shot of Joaquin Phoenix, The Master appears headed for greatness. Why? For one, this is a PT Anderson picture, and he's given us two of the most mesmerizing character studies of the 21st century in Punch-Drunk Love and There Will Be Blood. In both of those films, he presents a protagonist who deep inside holds a passionate flame of rage ready to burst out at the right moment. Anderson is a master at developing these characters, allowing the audience to slowly absorb their mindset and feelings. Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a character that's instantly intriguing. We meet Freddie on a beach, where he and his fellow navy men are spending sometime off duty. Freddie is attempting to get drunk off of some sort of coconut concoction. Actually, we see he's always trying to get drunk as we follow his post war exploits for the first 20 minutes or so of the film. Every frame of these twenty minutes is absolutely perfect, making the character all the more fascinating by the minute. The meat of the story though, begins when Freddie finds himself hitting rock bottom, with few options left. He ends up getting caught up with a rising spiritual movement called ""The Cause"" headed by the charismatic Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour-Hoffman). You of course expect that this is where those emotions inside Freddie should start coming out, and become clearer. However, things turn out not to be that simple.The Master an intellectual film that is likely to be the most conversation-provoking movie of the year. At an emotional level though, it doesn't hit the spot. It has these big themes it's dealing with, like faith, and alcoholism, yet beneath all of that it seems to loose track of the characters. Quell and Dodd are both extremely fascinating characters, but I felt like I was on the outside looking in at them, never getting a sense of their motivations or thoughts. ""What's troubling Freddie?"" I asked myself. I can think of some possibilities, but I couldn't feel them.To make things worse, the distance between the characters and myself only seems to grow as the films moves on. Midway through, Freddie has become the right hand man of sorts to Dodd. What puzzled me though, was where this connection between the two was coming from. Again, I could come up with some possibilities, but I don't want a movie to leave me guessing; I want it to show me. Why is Freddie so compelled by the cause? What are these demons that seem to bother him? Ultimately, Freddie ends up in a position where he has to evaluate his commitment to the organization as well as his future altogether, and again I was left confused and in the dark. The ending is ambiguous and I couldn't seem to see Freddie in a way any different from how I saw him five minutes in. I'm not asking for complete answers, just enough evidence to come up with an interpretation.I feel it sets itself up to deliver so much that it's hard to avoid being even just a little disappointed. I do understand, however that many people will  and already have been  completely engrossed by this movie, and I will not argue with them. This review reflects not really my criticism of the film, as much as my inability to connect with the characters. I honestly envy anyone who was able to do that. That said, The Master has much to dissect intellectually, and I look forward to repeat viewings."
320,The Master,8,29 April 2017,"The Chemistry Between Hoffman and Phoenix says it All,","The Master is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is an extremely engaging film that pulled me in almost immediately, featuring many very intriguing characters that reel you in from the beginning. It is nothing that we have not come to expect from Paul Thomas Anderson, his unique directing style is highly evident throughout, and I do not think any film maker could have told this story as effectively. I did feel that it dragged on a bit. Running at almost two and a half hours, there was a lot more to this film than there really needed to be, a lot of long winded, dialogue heavy scenes that became tiring after a while. The cast is phenomenal, and it's one of those movies where the whole thing would not have worked out without engaging actors. Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix bounce off one another brilliantly, they both bring in powerful, dedicated performances, watching these two truly special actors perform together is a real pleasure. The performances will pull you in almost immediately. Well acted, directed and truly engrossing, I would recommend The Master to anyone looking for a good drama. An alcoholic and a leader of a religious cult become close friends. Best Performance: Phillip Seymour Hoffman"
321,The Master,2,16 May 2016,"Pointless, meaningless, pretentious babble","Hoffman again plays the sort of over-rated character at which he excelled, which apparently came natural to him: a lost, pseudo-intellectual bully, a shallow man with delusions of grandeur. Not interesting, not entertaining, not amusing, not educational, nothing! Phoenix is his assistant in this waste of time, in a role that just about any third-rate actor could take in stride. Ugh! This is a drab, boring, dismal film that starts nowhere and takes a long time to get nowhere. The cinematography is solid at times, but inconsistent. A major disappointment. Probably nominated because this kind of drivel happened to be flavour-of-the-day at the time. Avoid it!"
322,The Master,1,25 April 2015,"Sorry, I don't get it.",Painfully slow.Phoenix and Hoffman are great actors and probably played their parts to the usual degree of excellence.The movie is quite depressing but I am sure it appeals to the viewers of more esoteric films.The subject matter is quite insidious but doesn't really offer an insight into Scientology which I expected.To be honest I don't really know if the story really developed that well save to say River's character pretty much goes from bad to worse.I like to be entertained if l invest 90mins.
323,The Master,7,23 January 2014,Not easy to like yet hard to resist,"In ""The Master,"" set in 1950, Joaquin Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a World War II vet apparently suffering from alcoholism and PTSD, who comes under the influence of a mind reprogramming cult called The Cause (modeled, obviously, on Scientology). Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the Svengali-like leader who personally befriends Freddie while casting a spell over both him and his entire flock of believers.Paul Thomas Anderson will never be a crowd-pleasing filmmaker. His movies revel in ""strange"" plots and ""weird"" characters. The themes and narrative lines are not always clear-cut or easily discernible. But for the more adventurous moviegoer, there is always much to appreciate and mull over in a PTA film. And ""The Master"" is no exception. In fact, it may be his most demanding work to date.It certainly provides a challenge to the casual moviegoer, for ""The Master"" is one of those rare films that doesn't have even a single character who could be classified as sympathetic and likable - a fact that many in the audience may find off-putting, to put it mildly. This makes the performances by Phoenix and Hoffman particularly impressive since they are called upon to make generally unappealing central characters interesting and compelling.Anderson's screenplay does its best to keep the characters deliberately opaque. Freddie is both intrigued by and strangely resistant to Lancaster Dodd's influence, quick to defend him - even to the point of physical violence if necessary - when faced with one of the leader's many detractors, but strong-willed enough to make a run for it when the opportunity presents itself. It's hard to tell whether Freddie's uncontrolled outbursts and bouts of antisocial behavior are strictly the result of the PTSD from which he's suffering or whether he is just an S.O.B. by nature and the illness is just exacerbating those tendencies.Dodd is no less inscrutable a figure. He is clearly a power-hungry charlatan, but he seems to have a genuine fondness for this deeply troubled young man who has stumbled onto his path. Yet, since we never get to see Dodd in even one genuinely unguarded moment - never once is the public mask dropped to reveal the man within - the movie becomes the cinematic equivalent of a Rorschach's Test, with the audience free to project whatever it sees fit onto the character in terms of personality and motive. This goes for the other characters as well. Dodd's wife (Amy Adams), daughter (Ambyr Childers), son (Jesse Plemons) and son-in-law (Rami Malek) remain largely peripheral figures in the drama - which is, I suspect, a deliberate move on the part of the writer, showing how living in the shadow of The Master has left them with no identity or persona that they can truly call their own.None of this is really intended as a criticism of the film, for I'd much rather grapple with a movie whose characters are filled with ambiguity than one in which they are too easily understood and read. But it does explain why the movie isn't always easy to like and relate to. But that is what makes movie watching interesting and rewarding, after all.And on a final side note, I'd like to point out that whoever hired dead-ringer Jesse Plemons for the role of Hoffman's son should have received a special Oscar for casting. Rarely have we seen a more fit choice to portray another actor's offspring. Well done, Sir or Madam!"
324,The Master,6,7 September 2013,Critically acclaimed but flawed...,"The film is beautifully shot, making full use of the various surroundings they find themselves in. The use of music from the period was quite effective also, not always to my taste, but it seemed to fit pretty well. As to performances, well, all the major parts were excellently portrayed with Philip Seymour Hoffman standing out. I found I really paid attention to every scene he was in; without him, meaning no disrespect to the other actors involved, it kind of fell flat. I though Amy Adams was excellent too, although I felt she was underused. There appeared to be an awful lot of improvisation, particularly from Joaquin Phoenix and I found these scenes very hit and miss. I sometimes felt like I was watching an acting class. As far as the narrative goes, well I found it meandering; it was very slow (not that this is always a bad thing) and when we did get to a point it would then go off in a totally different direction. Over all, it didn't stand out as the particularly outstanding work the critics seem to think it is; but then again, I don't have to watch all the dross they have to on a day to day basis. Maybe I have to watch a lot of really bad films and then watch this one again, but for now it's 'Recommended', but only just.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 6.1/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
325,The Master,7,16 August 2013,Paul Thomas Anderson Master-craftsman,"Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is a sexually perversed WWII vet who takes on Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as a father figure.I wished for Paul Thomas Anderson to be declared a master himself. The craftsmanship is certainly evident. The film looks beautifully sad. The acting is completely unique. Joaquin Phoenix does a truly intense portrayal of a broken man. Philip Seymour Hoffman is convincing. Amy Adams plays PSH's wife who turns out to be much more perversed. There is a lot to like about this movie but the intensity of Joaquin's performance does wear thin. It can really grind down the audience. Overall, this is expertly made."
326,The Master,9,17 July 2013,Phoenix is the True Master!,"Every now and then you get a film that people either love or despise. The Master finds itself in that category. I for one find it to be an incredible film. As i sat in the cinema mesmerised; i could see at the side of my eye people getting up and leaving, and this wasn't just a few people who'd had enough but a dozen or so. That summed it up. For me those people were missing out on not only a poetic tale of human nature, but a polarising portrayal of psychology. In my opinion Joaquin Phoenix was robbed of an Oscar for best actor. Don't get me wrong Daniel Day Lewis was outstanding in Lincoln, but Phoenix's performance as Freddie Quell was, well - to almost replicate the films namesake - Masterful. And alongside the equally magnificent Phillip Seymour Hoffman they produced some of the best acting i have seen. This may come across a over exaggerated, but there is a specific scene between the two that left me spellbound. You may love this film or like other you may despise it, but it is certainly worth finding out."
327,The Master,3,30 March 2013,Nicely Packaged Writhing Mess,"The 3 stars are for Phoenix and Hoffman's acting and Anderson's cinematography.I think this could've been a great take on how cults prey on damaged people but this was just all over the place for me.Phoenix's character was just a deeply unlikeable weirdo you can't figure out or connect with. You never get any feel of what the cult's about. The tediously predictable overdose of ""ooh weren't people twisted and dirty back then"". God that got tired about 20 years ago. They really murder movies when they overdo it on that. Less is more. We get it, people had sex then like they do today - move on for the love of God.Amazing amounts of energy in some parts but just randomly directed, disjointed, pulling in different directions. You could take 90% of the film, re-edit it in random order and I bet people's reactions to it would be exactly the same - it's that incoherent.Really shocked given the plaudits this received when it came out. It's left me feeling like I need to shower my mind - not because I'm uncomfortable with anything in it - just because it was a mess, twisted for twisted's sake, and ... just bad. Why waste good acting, sound and camera work on incompetent material like that.If I had to describe this film to someone, all I could honestly say is ""deeply disturbed oddball comes out of the navy and joins some kind of cult - then loads of random uninteresting things happen"".You know you've seen a bad movie when it leaves you feeling angry for having spent the time on it."
328,The Master,3,25 March 2013,"A Laboured Chore Shouting ""This is a Great Movie"".","Taken apart there's nothing wrong with any individual elements of this film except the script and yes I mean that sarcastically.Great cinematography, great score, great performances... many subtle cinematic references... all of which shout: ""THIS FILM IS AS GOOD AS THOSE OTHER ONES WE'RE CLEVERLY REFERENCING HERE!""... again, and again and again.My problem is simple: I found all of the main characters to be completely unlikeable, I found it impossible to empathise with any of them.I laboured through to the end and found essentially every character unchanged by their experiences. I left feeling absolutely nothing atall, not even anger towards my wasted two and something hours.If this film's main message is the utter futility of everything, including the act of watching it, then it succeeds with flying colours.I wanted to like it, I failed. The night before I watched Coppola's ""Youth Without Youth"" - that film had obvious flaws but despite its absurd premise felt more truthful than this vapid concoction. I almost expect an invisible curtain to open before my very eyes right now revealing that ""The Master"" was created by the world's first sentient computer... that would have made me a little happier, at least that's progress!"
329,The Master,3,19 March 2013,The secret is within the film,"I love Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams, and so eagerly rented this movie with very high expectations.For background: I don't need a tightly scripted film, or one that leads you by the hand, or necessarily has some point to make, but this meandered, repeated itself, and wallowed in self-indulgent sludge.The acting is impeccable, but given the cast it couldn't be anything but, and because of that I did sit through it in its entirety.It struck me as a fantastic wasted opportunity. The connections between the actors were strong, and the relationships believable, but the script..... The secret is within the film? Well, at one point Joaquin asks someone what they think of the Masters latest book, and the chap says that the whole thing could have been condensed down into a 3 page pamphlet. Unfortunately, this (for me) describes this film. Imagine a 3 minute script blown up into a 2+ hour movie that almost solely relies on great acting to carry it and you pretty much have this film.I wouldn't go as far as to say it's not worth watching, and if you were in a very thoughtful introspective mood it may have some resonance in parts, but boy, will you have a long wait in between those moments."
330,The Master,6,24 May 2013,Not any where near as good as his other films,"No spoilers as such but I may give indications of the type of film it is.I rarely write reviews but when I do it is normally due to a misleading score. I like Magnolia and Boogie nights but unfortunately this film is somewhat lackluster. Lets put it this way, it is not popcorn material and not exiting (and I did not find it thought provoking). It is just odd and surreal. Magnolia actually stirred emotion in me and so did Boogie nights.To be perfectly honest I am not quite sure what it is attempting to convey (in the way of meaning). I doubt it is a reference to Scientology. It kind of seems to be about 2 unstable people who kind of drift together in some sort of fashion. Both seem to be equally irrational and everyone around them seems irrational. Maybe it does have some kind of meaning but it eludes me. Maybe I just watched it at a bad time. The acting is professional and the directing is equally professional. It just never seems to have any kind of ""spark"". I just cannot relate to anyone and I am most certainly not someone who has had an uneventful life (in other words, I could be considered a bit ""strange"", as it were!)Basically, to summarize, the film just does not seem to have any kind of clear purpose or meaning. The acting and direction is professional; that is why I give it 6 instead of a much lower score. If you like slow moving films with elusive meaning then you may like it. I would not get the popcorn out though!"
331,The Master,5,12 March 2013,"Excellent Acting, poor storyline","As ever Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquim Phoenix were excellent. I was very impressed with their acting.However, at over 2 hours long the story dragged and was very disjointed. I kept on waiting for the story to get better and it didn't. After seeing the score out of 10 for this film I was really looking forward to seeing it, don't bother.This director has made much better films than this, it was so disjointed and messy.It must have been a poor year for acting if Amy Adams was nominated for best supporting actress, as she did nothing out of the ordinary."
332,The Master,3,11 March 2013,"If boredom was the point, it is one really successful movie!","I wanted to see this movie, because I loved 'There will be blood'. Maybe I expected too much. But this movie left me speechless, not in a good way. All the time I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing did. What is the point of this movie? Is it like 'Space Odyssey 2001', a movie that wants to show you how people in spaceship were bored? I don't get it...But sure we were bored while watching it. Hoffman and Phoenix are in most scenes together, and both as lead roles. I colud not imagine how irritating these two are in the same movie. Some scenes alluding sex and masturbation only make people uncomfortable, but maybe it was the point. I read the review like, it is about human nature and how unpredictable it is etc... But, nevertheless, I can't see the bright spot about this film, and I really didn't understand what problem was with Phoenix and his acting. Sometimes he is perfectly OK, and sometimes completely crazy.It seems, I missed the sense and message the film sent to the world? Did I?"
333,The Master,6,9 March 2013,Disappointing,"Weird gurus and teachers are a constant element in Paul Thomas Anderson's movies. In his first film, 'Hard Eight' (aka 'Sydney'), there's the experienced gambler, adored by his younger pupil. In 'Magnolia', there's the crazy sex-obsessed teacher - the most memorable performance by Tom Cruise ever. In 'There Will Be Blood' there's the charismatic preacher. His new film, 'The Master', is devoted entirely to another guru: a cult leader who becomes an idol for an alcoholic and disturbed war veteran. Both parts are excellently played by respectively Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix. The latter is like a caged gorilla, seemingly peaceful but unpredictable and ready to attack at any moment. Unfortunately, these two actors are the only good things about the movie. There is hardly any plot to speak of. I kept waiting for some sort of development or apotheosis, but it never came. (In the official trailer, we see Phoenix with a gun, but this scene is not included in the actual film. Several other images from the trailer are not in it either). Neither is there any character development. Both men are crazy in their own way, and the film keeps on showing this in an endless succession of scenes with no point. Any suspense is completely absent. A lot of scenes don't seem to serve any purpose in moving the story forward. What also bothered me is that the crucial element of the film - the strange attraction the two men feel towards each other - is never explained. When even his wife and daughter tell him the veteran is crazy, dangerous and 'beyond hope', the cult leader keeps on brainwashing and indoctrinating him. Why? When the cult moves to England, the cult leader phones the veteran to follow him. Why? When the veteran eventually comes to England, the cult leader rejects him because his wife wants him to. All this is never explained, just shown. You could argue that an explanation is not necessary, because the film deals with irrational feelings, and emotions that are beyond explanation. True, both men's behaviour is erratic, unpredictable and crazy. But that doesn't make the film any better. Terrific acting alone is good enough for a stage play. But a film requires more than that to be really good. I think 'The Master' fails on that point."
334,The Master,3,6 March 2013,"Tedious, NOT entertaining, confusing","World War II Navy veteran Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is back from the war and has problems conforming to the real world. He is an alcoholic who makes his own drinks from whatever is at hand, paint thinner, cleaning materials etc. He meets up with Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) known as The Master, who seems to be creating a Cult. Can The Master help or hurt Freddie?I had a very hard time understanding this movie. The Master didn't seem to have a definite mantra to expound on. He was all over the place and confused us with vague talk of time travel and past lives. No good lines came out of his utterances. Bummer. Freddie and The Master latch on to each other; and, at times, Freddie violently defends him. Freddie needs to be needed. We got to see Phoenix talk through clenched teeth on one side of his mouth (reminded me of some of Marlon Brando's stints in some movies) and this was very clever. I kept watching to see if he would slip up. HA ! However, I do not applaud an actor acting like a crazy person (hey, we can all do that) as that is not acting in my opinion. But, that is what we get. When Phoenix wasn't acting like a crazy person he was very good. He was nominated for Best Actor. Didn't get it. Hoffman was great throughout and this became somewhat enjoyable when he was on screen. He truly is a presence. However, at times, I thought that The Master's wife Peggy (Amy Adams) was the real Master, and Hoffman's character was the out-front carnival barker pretending to be The Master for the masses. Still Hoffman should have been nominated for Best Actor. He wasn't. He was nominated for an Actor in a Supporting Role. Didn't get it. Just because the entire cast and Phoenix and Hoffman performed well, this is not an endorsement that the movie itself should be given a high rating. Again, over all, this was not informative or entertaining. This is a movie that is not as good as advertised and will NOT hold interest for many. (3/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Masturbation scenes: Yes. Nudity: Yes. Full frontal. Language: Yes."
335,The Master,10,3 March 2013,An American Struggle of Brute Desire and Dreams of Control,"This film plays more like a fevered dream than like realist history, so people expecting some sort of conventional narrative may quickly lose patience with this movie. They may also be missing something special. In addition to being glowing symbols more than they are conventional characters, neither Freddie Quell (Jochain Phoenix) or Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffmann) is especially likable. But the performances suggest emotional and historical truth in ways that are often moving, without pretension or sentimentality. Freddie Quell is a figure of the American male id, post World War II: violent, sensuous, insatiable. He's driven to drink drafts of American industry to quench his burning: the fuel of torpedoes, the fluids of photography, institutional cleaners, all mixed with the fruits of the earth. Dodd, ""The Master,"" is a new-model super ego who might tame and direct Quell. Dodd is smug as a baronial magnate, as full of literary pretensions as Tom Sawyer; his resolve is borrowed from his steely wife (Amy Adams). Hoffman's Dodd, contrary to rumors about the film, is not a charismatic, psychological autocrat, but is wounded, defensive, and dreamy. He lives out a fantasy of priestly insight and command, but few people really believe him; he gets the benefit of many doubts. As Quell is drawn to Dodd's fantasies of mind over history, Dodd is drawn to Quell's energy and chemical inventiveness. Together they suggest different means of achieving atomic-age versions of the old American goal of obliterating the past and standing alone in a new present. They also suggest the polar tensions of raw animal desire and magisterial fantasies of triumph present in many American men. Quell's desire to consume, dominate and love the earth (Quell is obsessed with a woman sculpted in sand) meets a rhetoric of platonic self-mastery in Dodd. The preposterous incongruity of the men and their desires does not result in a drama of control and exploitation, which audiences may expect, but in inchoate attempts at mutual understanding in several scenes that are more humanly intimate and dramatically resonant than most sexual episodes in movies. The 70mm ""real film"" photography in this movie is amazing; many of the film's strongest moments, including those with people, are wordless. An irony of the film is that lush and magnificent nature (the Pacific ocean, the Arizona desert, the San Francisco Bay) is often overlooked by Quell and Dodd in their self involutions. Nature in American writing often becomes a symbol of self; the oceanic and desert shots sometimes suggest the roiling interior energies and ideal spaces of these two men, but they never acknowledge these colossal, external realities. But lived, human nature may have the last word, in an ending that is unexpectedly funny and tender. I rate this as one of the best American movies."
336,The Master,2,20 February 2013,The Tree of Life with dialogue,"If you're into cults and their manipulation of mentally unstable people there are much better documentaries than the feature film The Master.As a work of art it is a long and barely watchable piece of cinema. Within the given framework the cast delivers a fine performance. The one that sticks out the most is, of course, Joaquin Phoenix. He pushes his character to such extent that it is hard to look at him on screen. Most of the time, though, he mumbles his lines, so there is no choice but to watch and try to read his lips.There's not much going on in the first half of the movie, then there is a slight change, but the story simply won't take off. It is not clear whether the movie's heroes are real people, based on real people or just a fruit of author's imagination. I find it alright to leave this ambiguous, but it is not alright to create an aimless movie and claim it is ""not for everyone"".If i had to describe The Master in one sentence i'd say it is The Tree of Life (2011) with more dialogue, i.e. slightly more accessible. This, in turn, makes you wonder whether the producers or the studio demand a specific approach in film making. If this is what happens with action moves, romantic comedies, etc why wouldn't it be possible with art-house movies?"
337,The Master,9,10 February 2013,Splendid Performances!,"Paul Thomas Anderson's 'The Master' is an unsettling & disturbing film that offers Splendid Performances by its magnificent cast led by Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman & Amy Adams. Though Anderson delivers a worthy film, the stand out here are its performances.'The Master' Synopsis: A Naval veteran arrives home from war unsettled and uncertain of his future - until he is tantalized by The Cause and its charismatic leader.'The Master' is an unsettling & disturbing film, because its moody & pitch dark. Anderson tells a story of complicated souls in search of redemption. Anderson's Screenplay is spell-binding in parts, but otherwise its bland. His Direction, on the other-hand, is plain ordinary this time. A Special Mention for the fabulous Cinematography by Mihai Mălaimare, Jr.Now Coming To The Performances! Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman & Amy Adams deliver career best performances. They are marvelous in their respective parts & rise above the erratic Screenplay. The 3 are Oscar-Worthy from frame A to Z.On the whole, 'The Master' isn't amongst Anderson's best efforts, but the performances are legendary."
338,The Master,7,18 November 2012,PTA's weakest film,"PTA is my favourite director, and I hate to say it, but The Master is PTA's weakest film. Maybe my expectations were too high, but then again, his earlier work managed to exceed my expectations. As a result, I was disappointed with The Master.However, that is not to say The Master is not a good film. It is a good film, and undoubtedly much better than most of the other titles released this year. The first half of The Master is mesmerizing and exactly what my expectations expected. The initial scenes between Hoffman and Phoenix are amazing and extraordinarily executed, especially the ""processing"" scene. The brief introduction into Hoffman's cult ""The Cause"" and his sheer belief and consequent extreme defensiveness of it are also phenomenal.Nevertheless, Anderson failed to maintain this compellingness throughout the whole film. As the film progressed, there were some scenes which were not absolutely necessary, some scenes which would have been good if executed better and some scenes which were simply overdone. I was quite disappointed, especially considering this film had a LOT of potential from the very beginning. Phoenix is utterly beautiful in this role, although it is no surprise since PTA always manages to direct an extraordinary lead. Hoffman is amazing as always, but doesn't offer anything special in particular. The film is cinematically gorgeous, but like I have been emphasising, The Master had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning, but gradually let me go before the film even finished. The film is well worth a look for a complete selection of PTA's film and some of the magnificent earlier scenes, but in my opinion, The Master fails to reach the greatness of Anderson's previous work."
339,The Master,10,30 September 2013,The Masterpiece!,"This is true cinema, a work of art, how cinema was intended to be.So many movies these days are just big effects or excessive over the top drama, trying to out do one another for most extreme whatever. So it is always a real pleasure to view something that is far more pure and artistic.The setting for the era is beautifully presented and really draws one into that world. The direction is brilliant and acting supreme. It almost gives a sense of hope towards the possibility of great cinema.Already looking forward to Anderson's next work.This is my movie of the year 10/10."
340,The Master,2,15 June 2013,Dumb,"Waste of time to watch this movie. I guess I don't like movies about weird people. How can intelligent people be taken in by ""cults.? This movie was depressing. No purpose to the nudity. It was rather disgusting. I like Juaquin Phoenix as an actor. He played the part well. Would like to see him in more movies. I liked him when he played Johnny Cash.I doubt if this movie recovers its production cost. I have not seen much advertisement about this movie. I hope Juaquin can get some better movie roles. I think his talents are under used. I would like to see him in a cowboy movie."
341,The Master,1,27 April 2013,If you are a fan of abstract art...,"There is no doubt in my mind that film is a form of art. A rather complete form I may add as it is the culmination of a variety of other art forms such as music, writing, sculpting, dramatic arts, painting and many more. To compare the Master to the graphic arts, the comparison comes to mind of a work of art I saw in the Tate museum of modern arts; namely a picture of a urinal attached to a tree. If you like to ponder what on earth the creator of this film could have been thinking, then go right ahead. If not, please spare yourself this waste of time and resources. Yes the actors are gifted and I consider Philip Seymour Hoffman one of the greatest of his generation, but the movie is just an in-congruent follow up of marginal events. It has come to my attention that films depicting people on the edge of society and reason are often rewarded with awards. This film shows alcoholism, incest and questionable cult psyche and should therefore fit nicely in the row of movies that are praised simply because of the theme. For those who prefer a more colloquial sum up; the movie is about a wackjob meeting a bigger wackjob. Enough said"
342,The Master,8,2 April 2013,The Master,"From director Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood), along with Argo and Silver Linings Playbook this was a film being talked about a good amount during the awards season and getting some good praise, including on Film 2013 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, but I didn't know much about it at all. Basically returning from Navy service following the Second World War, veteran Freddie Quell (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Joaquin Phoenix) becomes an alcoholic sex-obsessed drifter, he tries working in a local department store as a portrait photographer nit is fired for fighting with a customer while drunk, and a job at a cabbage farm falls through as well. Intoxicated one night he stows away on a yacht, and waking up he is introduced to yacht owner Lancaster Dodd (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Philip Seymour Hoffman), he is the leader of ""The Cause"", a philosophical movement, and he is invited to stay and attend the wedding of Elizabeth (Ambyr Childers), Dodd's daughter, as long as he will make more of a special brew he develops using paint thinner. Freddie begins the exercises to become part of the movement as well, this is called Processing, including a flurry of questions he must answer instantly without hesitation, including revealing the details of his father's death, his mother being placed in an institution, having an incestuous relationship with his aunt, and abandoning love of his life Doris who to him while he was in the war. Dodd sees something in the stowaway and allows him to travel with his family, as they spread ""The Cause"" and its teachings along the East Coast, staying with women as guests who are drawn to the movement, but Freddie still cannot control his sexual or alcoholic addictions, and this is obvious when he assaults an inquisitive man following a New York dinner party. Besides the attachment Dodd has for him members of ""The Cause"" begin to worry about Freddie's behaviour, while in Philadelphia with an altar attendant in public worship Dodd's wife Peggy (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Amy Adams) tells him to stop drinking if he wants to remain with them, he agrees with this, but he does not keep this promise. Dodd's son Val (Jesse Plemons) is criticised by Freddie do disregarding the movement teachings, but the son reveals the information being given out is being made up as goes along, Dodd does get arrested for practising medicine without qualifications, and so is Freddie for assaulting the police, and in adjacent cells they get the chance to talk about ""The Cause"" more intimately. Freddie is angry and questions everything he has been taught and accuses it of all being fake, both men insult each other, but being released they reconcile their difference, but the movement members think the former drifter may be insane, and may be some kind of undercover agent. To prove himself and gain trust back from ""The Cause"" he submits himself to additional exercises, becoming increasingly frustrated and angry at the repetition of them, but he eventually passes the tests, and he attends them as they release Dodd's latest book in Phoenix, Arizona, but he again assaults someone criticising the book teachings quality. Philadelphia hostess Helen Sullivan (Laura Dern) in the lecture hall confronts Dodd suggesting experiences of ""other lives"" to be ""imagined"" rather than ""recalled"" in his book, he loses his temper about this, and in another exercise we see him ride a motorbike to an object in the distance of the desert and back, and Freddie does the same, but he rides and does not return, abandoning the group. Having left ""The Cause"" he goes home to try rekindling his relationship with Doris, but she has married and has a family in Alabama since he left, her mother confirms this, disappointed he leaves but is at least happy that she has found happiness for herself, and with no place to go he finds a move theatre and sleeps in there. While there Freddie has a vision of Dodd calling him on the telephone having located him mysteriously, that he is in England and wants him to join him as soon as possible, he thinks this dream is literal and he goes to reunite with Dodd across the Atlantic, and arriving he finds Val is still employed by his father and that the movement has expelled Elizabeth. He is happily welcomed back by Dodd, but Peggy says he should not be involved with the movement because he has no intention of improving his life, and Dodd finally realises his wife is right and gives him an ultimatum, stay with ""The Cause"" and for the rest of his life devote himself to it, or leave and never return. In the end Freddie leaves, after Dodd serenades him with the song ""Slow Boat to China"", and at a local bar he picks up a woman, and while having sex he poses her questions similar to the Processing he learnt, and the final moment sees him lying with a sand sculpture of a woman on a beach he built during the war. Also starring Rami Malek as Clark, Kevin J. O'Connor as Bill William, Christopher Evan Welch as John More, Martin Dew as Norman Conrad, Joshua Close as Wayne Gregory, Kevin J. Walsh as Cliff Boyd and Frank Bettag as Frank. Phoenix is terrific as the physically bad tempered vulnerable due to post-war stress man unsure of reality and fantasy, Hoffman is really convincing as the leader of what is essentially a cult, and Adams equally so as his wife, the story is essentially a man with nowhere to go in the world being brainwashed into believing sometimes ridiculous and made up things, it works more as a character study though because they are all compelling, it'll probably make you question what you believe, a great drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Original Screenplay for Anderson. Very good!"
343,The Master,9,4 February 2013,Incredibly rewarding,"The Master opens in the closing moments of World War Two, the drunken and isolated Freddie, winging his way on a Navy ship. He seems awkward in the presence of these men, iconographically like the muscular, homoerotic imagery of Kenneth Anger or Jean-Paul Gaultier. On a sun kissed beach, the sailors watch in bemusement as Freddie mock-f***s a woman made of sand, leg akimbo, the audience full of laughter, until the misogynist display goes on, becoming increasingly uncomfortable. In subsequent scenes Freddie shows his infantile, possessive obsession with sex and female genitalia, and the drunken fantasy that drifts in and out of his consciousness. He's a drifter with no place to go, a fractured family life, with no skills but a dangerous ability to make alcohol. In the chaos of his intoxicated mind, he wants a father figure, and after an accidental poisoning with his alcoholic concoctions, of a man he told looked like his father, Freddie stumbles upon a ship sailing sailing from San Francisco to New York through the Panama canal, and meets leader of The Cause, Dodd.Like Hubbard, Hoffman's Dodd is a publisher of a book who's ideas create a loyal, devoted following in 1950's America, where religious movements separated from traditional ones were beginning to surface in greater numbers. The ideas within this quasi-religion, The Cause, are differing in many ways to Scientology (it does however include the idea that humans have existed for trillions of years), and Dodd confidently states that our spirits live for millennia, living through different physical vessels - not unlike the concepts in what is now called past life regression. But here, Dodd claims that through confronting past demons the subject can return to an emotional state of ""perfect"". It's a flimsy concept, and one which Dodd even has difficulty in defending or explaining when confronted with challengers to his philosophies. His son, Val (Jesse Plemens), tells Freddie that his father makes this stuff up as he goes along; this is not a stable functioning family, let alone a legitimate, or cohesive cult, where all followers agree with every alteration, or frivolous concept that The Master orates.The film is not clear about the full nature of Lancaster and Freddie's relationship; at times it is like a father/son dynamic, then a homoerotic tinge is suggested, but they almost always seem at odds, battling even when calm and collected. But the real chaos that Freddie brings is juxtaposing the more secretive chaos behind the doors of the cult. On the surface Lancaster is jovial and accommodating, but as with Freddie, his demons, his complications, and his occasional inability to explain his wild theories, at times highlights his own chaotic psychology. In the time that Freddie stays with The Cause, Dodd is preparing his second book, 'The Split Sabre', and it seems that cracks are perhaps appearing in the ""congregation"", and Dodd is desperately attempting to cling to his followers, and with it continue leading with false ideas, and often ludicrous practises. The Master is about the destructive nature of these two characters, who often provoke each other into obscure and dangerous behaviour.It would be impossible to write about this film without mentioning the two central roles. Hoffman plays Lancaster with a cool charisma, and he must have been intended for the role (he has worked with Anderson before). With simple motions he captures the belief of power in the character, he approaches other men, dramatically swinging his hand to slap against their hand. Dodd is in control of these people, he holds the power, but he is playful, a possessor of humour used as psychological warfare. In a scene at the end of his daughters wedding reception, he leaves, grabbing the audiences attention, announcing to not rise for his departure, whilst laughing but waving his hands up, in a motion to stand. Phoenix is also quite exceptional as the tortured cheat, his eyes saying more about anxiety and pain than any words could achieve, so an Oscar nomination was inevitable. He probably won't win due to another nominee having portrayed an American icon. Hoffman also received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.The post-war rise of psycho-analysis, particularly in the United States, could be seen as another tool of control. Civilisation determines what sanity and insanity are, or what it looks like. In The Master, these two men are both sane and insane simultaneously, and they may represent that change in culture and society after such a monumental war, with realities that even now are difficult to comprehend (yet they still happen today). Something that struck me whilst watching this film was the central idea of past lives. I was overwhelmed with the profound nature of death, and this somehow explains why people attach themselves to religion, and other ideas of the continuation of existence. It is difficult to comprehend death as the end. It may simply be easier to cling onto a seemingly ridiculous idea than confront the possibility of an absolute end to life. Whilst Anderson's film is not perfect in fully committing to the many, often erratic, ideas that permeate the film, the combination of the performances, the beauty of the image and the music, create an experience that is incredibly rewarding.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
344,The Master,9,16 September 2012,A brilliant allegory on Obama and the country he cannot help,"When I read the first reviews of this movie, something puzzled me. On the one hand, viewers were saying the movie was brilliant. On the other, they were saying it was boring and not audience friendly. I was expecting therefore a sketchy public response when it opened. In fact, the audience has thronged to this film unlike anything I've seen since Black Swan. The Cinerama Dome was not only sold out, there was a line leading up to the theater, a first for the Arclight.The question is, why does this story resonate so strongly with audiences? The answer is simple. It is a reflection of the experiences Americans are going through, with a leader who makes it up as he goes along, has no idea what he's doing, and therefore cannot fix the problems he's trying to address.In the story, Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, is a charismatic leader with two daughters. He is also the head of a movement called The Cause. Freddy, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is a US sailor, who, out of the trauma of the war, has PTSD, and is hopelessly alcoholic. He is so deranged, he cannot hold a job, and occupies himself with concocting beverages which are so lethal, they kill an immigrant worker.He eventually wonders into the world of Lancaster Dodd, who takes him under his wing and tries to cure him. The unusual thing about this story, is that the character is never able to change. The cures Lancaster Dodd gives to Freddie are pure nonsense, and therefore, cannot work.The fact that this story lacks a classical character arc is fascinating in and of itself. That the public connects so strongly to this can only be explained by the collective experience we're all having, of watching our country sit under a charming bullshit artist for the last four years, with nothing good coming of it. No fixing the debt, which we're just as addicted to as when we started. A dead economy. A leader which all of us, even those who loved him, have figured out is a BS artist.A fascinating moment occurs at the end of this story, where Freddie, now presenting himself to Dodd in England, enters a palatial office where Dodd now works (with majesty similar to the oval office). Dodd's inability to cure Freddie becomes the topic of discussion. Dodd sings to Freddie a song which might at first seem incomprehensible, but makes sense within the context of an allegory. Dodd sings that he wants to take Freddie on a slow boat to China. Why China? Where did that come from? It is never mentioned any other time in the story. It has no contextual meaning. But within the framework Obama's continuance to pile up debt to the Chinese, it fits. This is were he wants us to go.When we view Dodd as Obama, and Freddie as the America who wants to be cured by him, the situations in this story suddenly find meaning. Take, for example, a scene in which Freddy and Dodd end up in jail. Freddie has a tantrum. Dodd attempts to tell Freddie that his problems arise from an implant put into him by aliens a trillion years ago. Clearly the purpose of this scene is to show how ridiculous Dodd's ideas are. There is no way in hell this guy will every be able to fix Freddie's problems. This echoes Obama, who, with a head filled with Marxist ideology, has wacky ideas on how to run the American economy, ideas that have not worked.In another instance, at a party, Dodd is performing past life regression on a woman in front of a large crowd. He is interrupted by a skeptic in the room who chides him on his beliefs. He points out Dodd has claimed in his book that his methods can even cure leukemia. When ridiculed thus, Dodd's response is not that he has evidence that he's cured leukemia, but that because of his beliefs, it is only fair to believe it would work. Someone who contests fairness must be an evil person. Sound familiar? In episode after episode, where Dodd applies his bizarre ideology to cure Freddy, the procedures give Freddie a temporary placebo belief he is cured, but then he falls right back into his patterns. Just like the stimulus gives a temporary sugar high to the economy, it quickly wears off, and we're back to where started. As Dodd says to Freddie about his worries, ""Don't worry, they'll still be there tomorrow"".In the end, the story is about a country that departed from its values and lost its way. The departure from our values in symbolized in the scene where Freddie meets up with his beautiful girlfriend, a sixteen year old virgin, sweet and pure, all peaches and cream, living in a boarding house. Yet Freddie walks away from her, never to return. He does not know why he does this. But he has, and now he is lost. How did America walk away from virtue, and in the middle of our insanity, turn to a charlatan, and think he could help us? The story does not try to answer why. It only hold up a mirror to show us what we've done. And in the end, when Freddie returns to the boarding house to find his old love, she is gone. We have picked the wrong leader to help us return to our roots, and when he was done with us, we were just as lost as we started.While there are a few points in this film where the story slows to a crawl, they are towards the end of the second act, and soon pass. This film is an intellectually stimulating experience. I expect anyone who knows what the word allegory means to be looking for exactly that. In The Master, you will find it."
345,The Master,6,18 November 2012,"Confounding, but purposefully so","In many respects, a similar film to There Will Be Blood, The Master starts with a virtuoso sequence establishing a man's background (PT Anderson loves a tracking shot!) and goes on to essay the power- struggles and cultural trajectory of modernising America.The drama at the heart of this heady, if opaque film is more abstract than There Will Be Blood. Rather like John Fowles' fine novel The Magus, the story fragments, dissolving into a confusing, dynamic movie in which the two principals seem bound only by themselves. Soon bound only by their own relationship and it's subtle, tilting one-upmanship, it can become difficult to know what the film at large is about.There are terrific performances, if - as in There Will Be Blood - the improvising gets a little edgy. Amy Adams as herself a powerful character is the equal of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix in their pivotal roles. Once again, Jonny Grenwood's original score accounts for a significant role in the drama, if not quite the absent character of the Oil! adaptation. It's a highly assured work of cinema - which it needs to be to sustain its 147 minutes running time. I was unsettled and fairly puzzled but not bored. 6/10"
346,The Master,4,21 October 2012,"Good, but too long","Good acting, but way too long. Our movie was two and half hours. A lot of which could have been cut out. None of the characters are likable, so that made it even worse. Joachim's character starts out in the Navy at the end of WWII. He tries photography, drinks and falls in love with a (really) young girl. He begins drifting and ends up in this cult. He connects with the leader, so he will do anything for the cause. When he tries to find the girl again, she has married and has kids. He tries going back to the cult, but the leader's wife won't stand for it. He then meets a woman in a bar in England and they seem to hit it off. You could go and see it, as I'm sure it will win some awards, but it is not entertaining to watch."
347,The Master,10,23 September 2012,Somewhat disappointed,"With three of the greatest films of the past 15 years on his resume (Boogie Nights, Magnolia and There Will Be Blood), this was probably my most highly anticipated film since No Country For Old Men.The cinematography and performances by all three leading characters (Hoffman, Phoenix and Adams) are outstanding.But the problem for myself and many others in the theater was that there simply is not enough conflict in this picture --- and this is surprising, given the amount of conflict in most of PT Anderson's past works.Still, it's definitely worth seeing. Like most of Anderson's films The Master will keep you thinking for the next several days. It just isn't his best work."
348,The Master,6,26 September 2012,The Master.... work of art... but lacking story,"First off I want to say that PTA has made several of my favorite films (There Will Be Blood, Punch Drunk Love). However, The Master was very disappointing to me. This was a perfect example of how a film can have outstanding cinematography, acting, production design, etc. but if the story isn't there the film does not work. I fell in love with PTA's other masterful works of art so I admit that my expectations may have been very high, but come on. I was wondering when the movie would end seeing no story coming together. There were several very powerful scenes. But the ending was ridiculous. I was angry because I felt this film had much more potential to be a great story. After all isn't that what going to the movies is all about? Not just watching pretty pictures on a screen, but experiencing a story come together. I'm sure many are going to disagree with me but I was not into the movie. I was not on the edge of my seat. I was bored for the most part. I would have no problem for this movie to win every award there is except for best picture, or screenplay. PTA let me down on this one, but I certainly believe he will come out with a true masterpiece yet again."
349,The Master,5,1 November 2017,Wanted to be something like Citizen Kane...,"Seen at the Viennale 2017: the story is not right (to me). The master (played brilliantly by Seymour Hoffman, 10 stars for his acting!) is preaching his philosophy of the character-development of human beings. And his theories go far: happenings in past lifes have effect on today's life of a person. But in the story itself it all collapses down to a simple failed love in the current life of Freddie Quell (completely over-acted by Phoenix - no wonder, he did not get an Oscar). Who ever tried a similar treatment for his own psyche, knows that true problems go so much deeper, than a missed love! Anderson was not able to catch the complexity (and possible beauty) of his subject. And it's really a shame - The Master was filmed onto 70 mm. And the festival here in Vienna showed a 70 mm copy on analog projection. Beautiful pictures and easily understandable spoken words. Overall, a missed opportunity, because of a lousy script."
350,The Master,5,27 August 2017,great movie...if the experts say so,I am sure that the experts are right and this is one of the best movies ever. I am also sure that it is my own fault that I found this movie one of the most boring ones of the 21st century.Great actors and great performances but boring.N.B. I saw the movie both at the theater after its release and on DVD in 2017.SUMMARY. Boring.EXPLANATION. (10* + 0*)/2 = 5*
351,The Master,6,21 August 2017,Great acting.  Boring movie.,"For over two and a quarter hours we are slowly walked through the relationship between a hopelessly war damaged drunk lost soul navy veteran and a charlatan who is the head of a cult. We surmise nothing much will come of this relationship for the drunk or the charlatan as it is easy to quickly ascertain (from the excellent acting) that neither of these leopards are about to change their spots. It has been alluded to that the movie's drifting non-narrative style is a metaphor for the drunk navy drifter. Get it? ... Or maybe it's supposed to be an indictment of Scientology or cults in general. For those of us not in need of edification on that front it seems pointless - over two hours of ""Yeah. We KNOW."" It kills me that so many movies held up as examples of cinematic artistic achievements sound so awful. And I don't mean the soundtrack (which didn't seem to add to the film) but the dialog suffering from varying levels and is at times unintelligible. Why is dialog easier to understand from movies many decades older technologically? So that leaves us with some damn fine acting that for some may be worth the time."
352,The Master,6,11 August 2017,Linear and misshapen,"Paul Thomas Anderson's typically lengthy movie 'The Master' tells the story of the association of a drifter and a cult guru, the latter clearly modelled on L. Ron Hubbard. As with his earlier 'There Will Be Blood', the story is both linear and not especially well-shaped, though Philip Seymour Hoffman is quite good as the pseudo-Hubbard. Indeed, that's the bigger problem here: Hubbard's story is quite interesting, and a good basis for fiction, but no light is shed by it that story through the eyes of a random acquaintance. What is presented here is just a story of two odd people, each of whom are hard to relate to. My favourite film of Anderson remains his first, 'Hard Eight'; interestingly, that was also his shortest."
353,The Master,7,7 June 2017,"I really wanted to like this movie, but 'The Master' is not quite a masterpiece. It does have some jarring flaws.","Inspired by the famous John Huston 1946's documentary, 'Let There Be Light', as well as early drafts of 2007's 'There Will Be Blood', drunk Navy stories that actor, Jason Robards had told to the director prior, and the life story of author, John Steinbeck. 'The Master' still falls a little short on explaining its title. Yes, I know, it's virtually impossible to tell the life story of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard without getting into the issue of being intimidation by them, but I wish this Paul Thomas Anderson's film could had done more, than tell a fictional story about Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a drunk & violent sex addict, whom finds himself, falling under the sway of charismatic cult leader Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his wife Peggy (Amy Adams) in an attempt to reform him. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the story, they gave us, but I really hope, the movie would have focus more on 'the master' personality than the 'server'. After all, that's what I pay for, to see. I wanted to see how Lancaster Dodd became 'the master'. I wish, the producers, had more balls, in explaining, how a cult is indeed founded. Regardless, the movie is still interesting in the character study concept of a lost soul, trying to find answers, yet, it falls a little flat. Don't get me wrong, Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor, and he was great as the man of unbridled thirst for alcohol, and sexual appetite. However, I wish the movie shown more character development with him, when he join the cult and after. Without spoiling the movie, too much, it seem like nothing, really changes for Freddie by the end of the film; making, watching the whole film, kinda pointless. I have to disagree, with viewers whom states that Freddie learn to become a master of his own life, because he seem happier, and more able to connect with others. I just don't see it that way. He's just as animalistic, depressed & unlikeable repulsive as he was, in the beginning of the film. After all, the movie ends with the same opening shot at the beach. Seeing it, again, kinda shows that he hasn't gotten over his lost-love one. Thus, making me, kinda upset that I wasted my time. I really wanted the film to end with a straight and strong message, rather than a weak & confusing one. I just don't like movies climax like that. Honestly, if the movie was a little more, clear that, the film is about, denying/betraying the need for a non-biological family, can lead to one's downfall can led you, directionless. Then, I wouldn't be so nitpicky. However, since it wasn't. I'm going to be, very truthful about how much of a time-waster, this film is. It takes forever to get, anywhere. Why!? It's because the movie has really bad pacing. While, there is plenty of lengthy substantial scenes that serve the film like the 'processing' sequence, there is also a lot of filler scenes that don't. Some examples are the many jobs that Freddie has, during the beginning. It wasn't needed. We know already, that he's an alcoholic and a sex addict, in the navy scenes. So, why does Anderson, feel to repetitive forced the same message, down, our throats with him, getting kick out of multiply jobs!? In my opinion, the movie would had work better, if they cut, those scenes, and just establishing himself, as a directionless sailor. It would had free, a lot of time and make more sense. Instead, it took, nearly 15 minutes for Freddie to meet Dodd! Then, there is the many wordy dialogue that follows this, that might sounds different and unique at first, but as you think, deep about it; you find out, later, how repetitive in meaning, they really were. That's really not good! Another, is the monotonous clichés action. Honestly, did we need, three similar sequences in which, Freddie attacks people who question, Dodd's practices and two, in which, Freddie question Dodd. Watching those, felt like 'processing'. It's kinda annoying. Despite that, I do like, how the film tries to explore man's struggle to cope with his animalistic nature. We see it, between the ways, Dodd & Freddie act, upon it. Dodd seems more castration and collected, due to the presence of his overbearing, wife. While, Freddie seem more likely to act upon, his urges. While, it's semi true, that Lancaster is trying to control Freddie's ungodly thoughts. In truth, he is secretly loving Freddie's freedom in Hedonism, because it allow him to act out, many of his fantasies through Freddie. Hints why, he keep him, like a wild pet, even although, he is the one, caged up. In a way, Lancaster is just like a human ego, feeding both the ID (Freddie) and the Superego (Peggy) in order to seek balance and be the voice of reason. I love that part of the film. I just wish, the movie focus more on those, rather than Freddie and Dodd fight against outsiders. Another thing, that I love, about this movie is, indeed the acting. All three main actors, did a good job. Any awards, they were nominated or win, was truly, worth it. Another thing that made this movie, not so bad, is the cinematography from Mihai Mălaimare Jr. There were plenty of beautiful scenes. Some, great examples are the motorcycles in the desert sequence and the shot of Freddie, pass out on his Navy ship. Even, normal shots like the bench scene was amazing to see. However, the music that Johnny Greenwood, compose was not memorable. Yet, it wasn't horrible to listen to, either. Overall: For a film that came from acclaim director Paul Thomas Anderson. 'The Master' is a bit too disappointing. It's a one-time watch from me."
354,The Master,6,23 April 2017,"Brilliantly Acted and Beautifully Lensed, but to What End?","If you're reading this, you've probably waded through countless reviews so there's no point summarizing in detail. You also know the performers, visuals and direction is all great. Why then did I give it a mediocre rating? Where to being...The storyline, such as it is, is fascinating: A nominally charismatic goofball germinating a Scientology-esque cult by supplying answers to people who don't know the question. Sure, they're idiotic and demonstrably untrue answers, but they are answers. I don't see you coming up with answers Mister Smarty Pants.It's a lesson you'd think humanity would have learned by now, that the validity of ideas, motives and honesty of would-be leaders should never take a backseat to the confidence by which they're presented; the con in conman stands for confidence, after all. It never ends well, whether it's a few dying to ride Halley's Comet, or millions dying because of notions of racial superiority and devotion to a really cool logo.And we keep making the same mistake.So anyway, the entirety of this particular movie is in the title, just think of it a different way: Dodd is the Master not in the sense of a leader, but in the sense of a pet owner, to the point he even calls Freddie, his prime follower, a ""good boy"", like a dog. Dodd's narcissism, like so many of these alleged leaders, is so great that he sees his followers not merely people in need of help, but as inferior dogs in need of training. This dynamic is so well established that Freddie could be played by a dog, like, say... Mr. Pickles. Other than a nugget of even-the-birds-are-chained-to-the-sky style sophistry extending these notions to everyone everywhere, the movie just doesn't go any deeper. While this is not a problem, what is is that it doesn't go any WIDER. Halfway through, all the deliberately paced, brilliantly acted scenes begin to pile up, as if they existed only because the director was too proud to cut them.People often compare Paul Thomas Anderson to Stanley Kubrick. Well, nobody, not one person I read, actually compared the two, they simply declared he's ""like"" Kubrick. Seems like any living director who knows enough about photography to remove a lens cap gets declared ""like"" Kubrick,(which is like, five). Anyway, an actual comparison reveals little stylistic similarity. Kubrick's movies were tight and filled with his trademark unsettling brand of humor. And though slowly paced, every single scene works in concert to move the picture ahead. They are virtually devoid of scenes where an attentive viewer wonders why Kubrick included it. The Master, on the other hand, has many such scenes. I mean, there's some reason there was an excruciating song and dance routine with naked chicks, but I can't figure out how it contributed anything worthwhile relative to its length. (This is where I'll invoke Gammu's Law: The quality of a film is inversely proportional to the number of times fans say ""you don't get it."")This movie does have some great scenes, no doubt about that, but they make little impact. Contrast that with Kubrick, whose talent for creating not only memorable, but iconic scenes was unrivaled. Once those scenes with naked women in A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, or Eyes Wide Shut are seen, they're not soon forgotten. Taken individually, most of the scenes in The Master are instantly forgettable.Why then the weak rating? It's not merely because Anderson is different than Kubrick -- we need original visions, not copycats -- it's that while they're both great directors, Stanley Kubrick was a great FILMMAKER. Where Anderson creates a sequence of brilliant tones, Kubrick created symphonies far greater than the mere sum of any notes."
355,The Master,6,18 March 2017,The kind of films where the form doesn't encourage you to give the content another chance...,"Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" was nominated in three categories: Joaquin Phoenix for Best Actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman for Best Supporting Actor and Amy Adams for Best Supporting Actress. And that's about as many nominations as this film deserves.I think even the detractors will agree that the acting is the best thing about the film but that doesn't say much, it enhances the enjoyment without being a useful vehicle to a specific narrative. The experience falls flat, and not even the kind of flatness that encourages you to give it a second chance. It's a journey that is not without some emotionally powerful moments but that just seems to proceed in a linear fashion, I didn't feel like I was climbing or descending, just walking, wandering on a rather flat and dry territory, to occasionally bump on some event.It is even more frustrating since the performances that were begging for a great story, starting with Joaquin Phoenix. He plays a Korean War naval veteran named Freddie Quell, this is a lost guy in every meaning of the word. We first see him, stranded in some island, drinking coconut milk, masturbating over a sand sculpture representing a woman and drinking gasoline from a torpedo. Seems like you can tell one hell of a story about his war years, but the film is about what comes next.So, when he's back on the civil world, we're in the early 50's and the man is obviously disoriented, he's a sexual pervert, he can't keep a job, he starts a fight and comes close very close to poisoning a Filipino plantation worker with his handmade liquor. Obviously, Quell has a problem and Anderson never really tries to explain why he acts like this, but his enigmatic personality is a good justification for Lancaster Dodd, the founder of a cult (inspired from Scientology), who grows an immediate liking on this 'sailor' who drifted alone in the world until landing on his yacht. He believes in Karma.Why Dodd like Quell? Well, he appreciates his crass manners, his fart jokes, and the way he boldly answers his questions without flinching during the exercise, revealing that he had sex with an aunt and that his mother was in a mental institute. Quell has obviously proved that he trusted Dodd and admitted that he has problems, there's a desperation Dodd manages to sense. And the second reason is more practical, Dodd loves that mixture Quell makes. So, there's a mutual addiction, Quell whose soul kept on wandering without a master found shoulders to rest on, and Dodd well, he reminded me of that quote from ""The Godfather"" novel, referring to Luca Brasi.The say in the novel that there are men who wander in the world demanding to be harmed, jumping out in any situation, the trick is to make yourself the only one they wouldn't want to be harmed by, then they belong to you (the word was actually 'kill' but here it applies to the idea of Master). And I suspect that's exactly the idea behind choosing someone as your master, the one you wouldn't fear, the one that would allow you to be the master of yourself if you can place your vulnerabilities in his side. And there comes a point in the film where we get it, where the relationship between Quell and Dodd is firmly established and could take some new turns.I waited for some pivotal moment, for the story to pick up in a way or another, it was an original screenplay after all, and anything could happen, some escalation somewhere. Yet the film remained frustratingly stuck to the relationship between the Master and the Disciple, and even such events as an arrest, suspicion raised by Dodd's wife Peggy (Adams) about Quell's motivation or an outdoor initiations, didn't contribute for the kind of psychological or emotional ordeals I expected. It was like the story was entrapped within the deep and intimidate bond between Dodd and Quell without anything meant to disrupt them, as if it didn't care for the viewers.In other words, there was no third act and the resolutions, while not forced and unrealistic, didn't really satisfy my initial hunger. Hoffman has a great supporting role as far as his performance as Master Dodd goes, but there's nothing much to 'support'. Quell is the lead character but what does that say exactly? Amy Adams is also severely underused.This is a film that is intelligently made and had all the potential to be a real knockout, instead it is a film that stays in a zone of psychological comfort and doesn't try to explore the fascinating personalities.In the end, I was wondering if I wouldn't have preferred a film about Quell's war experience, how did he turn out to be this unsettled guy we see at the beginning? Maybe what the film lacked was a first act, I don't know, but there are just too many interrogations marks, they're obviously deliberate and the number one fans will find many material for philosophical interpretations, and maybe, I would find some elements worthy of appreciation if I gave it a third chance, but the film is just so bleak and gloomy to inspire the same deep involvement as Quell for the Cause.I'd rather see ""Nashville"" a third time What's ""Nashville"" got to do with ""The Master""? Well, I saw these two films the same week and I didn't like them at the first viewing, I like ""Nashville"" better a second time and I feel like I can watch it over and over again, if only for the atmosphere and the music. ""The Master"" might be a hidden masterpiece, I saw it twice, but even if there was something I missed in the content, the form didn't encourage me to give it another chance."
356,The Master,,6 February 2017,The weak and the strong,"I'm not going to try to play film critic here and talk about the technical aspects of the film or anything.I'll just say this is one of the most beautifully shot, haunting, deep, character driven movies I've ever seen.I get a totally different take on this movie than most. To me it's about egos. Secrets and lies, and hidden agendas.Freddie is a pawn for the cause. Manipulated and used for the masters own ego maniacal game. Freddie learns nothing but is brainwashed. What he really gets out of the cause is the sense of belonging and false love.All he ever needed was love which in the end he finds. Throughout the entire movie the Masters hides his latent homosexual desires for Freddie and when it is finally revealed Freddie gets it and can finally break free of the causes grip.This is just what I get out of this movie. It's one of those movies that can give many different meanings to many different people. Which is what good art is all about."
357,The Master,10,26 January 2017,The Master(piece),"The first time I watched The Master, I honestly did not know what to think of it. Its aesthetic qualities are undeniable, the cast does an absolutely phenomenal job, and Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is stellar. But, fundamentally, what was the point of that lengthy character study? Was that even a character study? Was there something bigger behind it? Why all these different scenes, sewn together and delivered in such a manner that the viewer has to draw its own conclusions on the two main characters? And, ultimately, what is there to learn about these characters? Is there anything to retain, beyond their respective stories? To tell you the truth, I felt very frustrated after the first viewing. What a complete head f*** that film was! But it kept growing on me. I kept thinking about it. Hell, I even watched There Will be Blood again, just to get a few hints on how I could possibly interpret The Master and the broader picture that it possibly drew. I read many articles about it, gathered different points of view. My favourite information and source for film reviews is Mediafilm, a French Canadian website that provides ratings (their rating system is absolutely incredible) and in-depth reviews of films from around the world. They absolutely loved The Master, and their review really shed some light on the broader picture to which I was previously making reference. That did not prevent me to draw my own conclusions subsequently. At that very moment, I realized how much work and thought I had invested in that film. Just like I did after first watching The Shining, trying to understand the ending, or No Country for Old Men, trying to understand what the sheriff's dreams could possibly mean. These two films are my personal favourites. And I am now glad to say that The Master definitely belongs on that very short list of films too.There Will be Blood explored two pillars/institutions of modern day America (capitalism and religion), and how they were fundamentally opposed to one another, fighting to gain control over the masses to the profit of a handful of individuals, whose malice and self- interest is portrayed in deeply nuanced, yet disturbing fashion. More importantly, it showed how animalistic behaviours were at the core of the foundation of these two pillars of what is, to this day, defined as American civilization. The Master kind of picks up a similar religion theme (or, at least, the idea of domination), this time in a post-World War II historical context, focusing on a mentally unstable war veteran, Freddie Quell (Joaquim Phoenix) and a charismatic cult leader, Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), who takes him under his wing. Now, there are no in-depth explanations on the cult itself, its origins, or anything along those lines. Freddie Quell is the subject of multiple calculated studies from Dodd's clan, but the idea here is that, despite pretending to have a serious methodology, there is a truly disturbing aspect to how distorted the individuals involved in that methodology can be, and how, despite those obvious distortions, they manage to create a movement and attract a considerable amount of followers.The two main characters make one of the most incredible on-screen duos you will ever see on film. Both Joaquim Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are nothing less than spectacular. These are very complex characters, and the chemistry between the two men when they share the screen is absolutely mesmerizing. I can hardly think of better performances than what's being delivered by both actors in this one. Paul Thomas Anderson shot the film in beautiful 70 mm, and the cinematography is simply gorgeous. There is no denying that Mr. Anderson is one of the great filmmakers of our time, with modern-day masterpieces like Magnolia, There Will be Blood, and The Master under his sleeve. To those who thought this was a pretentious, slow-moving, piece of artsy garbage, I highly suggest at least a second viewing, or reading one or two opinion pieces on the subject, because The Master is no easy task for any viewer. It is a complex, rich, and haunting piece of filmmaking which, in my opinion, ranks among the absolute best of our time. With the recent notion of ""alternative facts"" being presented to the media and the mass movement that we are seeing in American politics as of late, The Master proves to be a timeless piece of cinema that goes way beyond telling the story of two interesting menit draws a broad, complex and disturbing picture of our modern American civilization, and how fundamentally distorted human beings and interactions might have led to it."
358,The Master,7,31 August 2016,"A slow, intriguing film","Whilst this film wasn't spectacular, nor was it terrible, it left me feeling like I didn't quite know what had happened for the duration of three hours. It's a very slow film, which reveals very little and that part is what frustrated me. I'm generally happy with 'slow' films, but I'm still working out what happened! Without the exceptional performances from Phoenix and Hoffman, I don't think I would have endured the film. They carried the film without a doubt, and it wasn't really until the final half an hour did the film's message click and it was at that point that I wanted more, but the 'journey' was over for the two main characters, which I accepted. It's a good film, but there's so much more potential and I was expecting more from the world that was promised in the synopsis. Overall a good film but requires a lot of investment in what might have little return for some viewers."
359,The Master,8,4 July 2016,Very good and often fantastic-another winner from Paul Thomas Anderson,"Although 'Inherent Vice' has yet to be seen, Paul Thomas Anderson strikes me as an equally talented film-maker and director who has yet to make a bad film. Even his weakest (so far, to me) 'Hard Eight' is still very good, and of his films 'Boogie Nights' and 'There Will Be Blood' are particularly note-worthy films.'The Master', when ranking his films, ranks as his second weakest. However as said, this is in no way a knock as it is still a very good film and often fantastic, the few not so good things are far outweighed by the numerous good things. And when the good things are good, man do they shine.Biggest flaw in 'The Master', the only big one really, is the final act. A case of an incredibly strong first two acts being somewhat let down by the somewhat unsatisfying final one. The momentum isn't as strong and it also seemed vague, incomplete and confused. Again, like 'Magolia's ending was, it is a polarising ending, that some will find touching and others will be negatively dumbfounded. It's not without emotional impact, just that it feels unsatisfying. While much of the script is fine, there are a few parts that are a bit too repetitive.However, as always with Anderson 'The Master' is superbly made. Anderson's films are some of the most visually beautiful and bold around, and 'The Master' is no exception. Exquisitely shot with sumptuous and atmospheric production values, Anderson's trademark visual style shines completely with his distinctive use of constantly moving camera, steadicam-based continuous long takes (a famous example in his films being the opening shot in 'Boogie Nights'), tracking shots and very multi-layered audio-visual imagery. Anderson's direction is superb.Paul Thomas Anderson's films have always had memorable utilisation of music, and again 'The Master' shines, being memorable and rich in emotion. The script is incredibly thought-provoking, rich in its bold use of multi-layered themes and gives 'Magnolia' a run for its money in the poignancy department. While not as polarising as 'Magnolia' perhaps, though some may disagree, 'The Master' is a challenging watch but also highly rewarding. The story on the most part while deliberately paced is just as thoughtful and very touching, it's also thematically intriguing and richly developed and contains realistically flawed and compelling characters if hard to like, important for a film that is essentially a character study.Great acting helps, and even the word great doesn't do justice to the quality of the acting here. Joaquin Phoenix is spellbinding, one of his finest performances and a standout performance that year. The late great Philip Seymour Hoffmann also gives a powerful performances that ranks among his best, his best performance in any of his collaborations with Anderson and he has been in most of them. Amy Adams and Laura Dern's performances are no less inferior either.In conclusion, very good and often fantastic, let down only properly by an unsatisfying final act. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
360,The Master,9,3 July 2016,A lively work of art from the brilliant mind of Paul Thomas Anderson,"This Paul Thomas Anderson drama is definitely no ordinary piece of work, it's an astounding work of art uprooted by the ingenious mind of a director with a powerful taste of direction, writing, and overall sensation. Complete with masterful performances by lead Joaquin Phoenix and supporting actors Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams as well an awe-inspiring script; this film showcases a captivating story of religion and its effects on someone in terms of personality. Taking an partial inspiration by L. Ron Hubbard and the inside work of the Church of Scientology, the story engages in plenty of elements that almost feels metaphorical to the Scientology cult including Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character serving as an archetype of Hubbard but with a less chilling personality than the real-life figure. Set in the 1950s, hot-headed U.S Navy Seal Freddie Quell (played by Joaquin Phoenix) returns home from active combat in World War II, haunted by the horrors of war and struggling to find a path for his future. This all changes when he boards a ship off the pier of San Francisco. There he meets Lancaster Dodd (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman), leader of a religious cult known as The Cause. When Freddie converts to Dodd's cult, he s taken into his family where he meets his wife Peggy Dodd (played by Amy Adams), his newly-wed daughter Elizabeth (played by Amber Childers) and other members of the religious movement. As Lancaster's teaches Freddie their ways of The Cause, this erratic behavior leads to the family and cult members to see him as a threat.Religion plays a major role in the story and upon viewing this, it is not too difficult to point out some comparisons to the story of L. Ron Hubbard and his founding of Scientology such as how his religious beliefs came simply from his imagination, and how Hubbard was a World War II veteran like Joaquin Phoenix's character before finding the church of the modernized religion. Comparison between The Cause and Scientology are clearly notable here, though there is no social commentary to be made. Paul Thomas Anderson takes this inspiration very well and turns into a deeply engrossing story. The story focuses on the bond between a drifter and a leader of a religious movement, and how the man struggles to comprehend the practices of this ""man-made"" cult. And the story is presented with a sense of liveliness and sensation, though the story drags on for quite some time which can be frustrating for some viewers; Anderson knows how to make it work. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd makes not only arresting Rom Hubbard-like figure but serves almost as the pinnacle of the story. The bond between Dodd and Joaquin Phoenix's Freddie Quell is both captivating and to some degree, thought-provoking. Quell's interaction with the other characters is often too complex to describe. Let's not forget the absorbing dialogue by Hoffman and Phoenix as well.As this movie is set during the 50s post-World War II period, Paul Thomas goes a long way to give the film a vintage feel. From the production design, to the cinematography by Mihai Malaimare Jr., to the classical music score by Jonny Greenwood; Anderson doesn't take realism for granted. Each scene is beautifully shot with a 65 mm camera to provide the picture with an old vintage texture without making it look too grainy, and by all means it works. The same can said about the classical production design, though not as impressive. The 1950s music score fits very well, especially during the opening minutes of Joaquin Phoenix on the beach. There are plenty of astounding aspects to be endured here, but the cast performances are the real deal here. Joaquin Phoenix is as good as ever, probably his best performance since his grueling, antagonist role in Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator'. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is deeply charismatic as the religious leader of The Cause movement. These two, both veterans of Paul Thomas Anderson's filmography, fall absolutely nothing short of Oscar ammunition. Then there is Amy Adam as the wife of Hoffman who is brilliant with her performance, though she doesn't quite stand out from her other Oscar-loaded roles.The Master is a lively work of art by director Paul Thomas Anderson, a film that more than has a likely chance of going down as a cinematic classic. Branched with captivating performances by an enthralling cast, Anderson's inspiring screenplay and overall direction; this film demonstrates the true ambition that Anderson is known for."
361,The Master,10,4 June 2016,The Masterpiece,"Wow, so my favourite movie of all time. Admittedly, I have yet to see some of the greats, but this one has such a connection with me, that I think it will hold its place for years to come.The performances are the go-to thing when discussing this film; which is why I'm saving it for the end. The Master abandons traditional narrative structure to deliver an eerie, unsettling portrait of mental health and those on the outskirts of society trying to find meaning in their lives. Lives that have been forced out by the very society that claims to be welcoming to them- veterans in a post-war America. the inaccessibility of the film, I feel, represents how unfamiliar and alien these people seem to be compared to everyday folk. Yet the film never goes out of its way to make you unsympathetic toward them, in fact, one can easily warm to Freddie (Mr Phoenix) even though we really shouldn't. The film's characters are almost Freudian in their presentation and I believe the parallels to the ID, Ego and Superego are no accident. I know people expected it to be some exposé of L. Ron Hubbard and that may be a disappointment, but those who can work past that, won't have a hard time appreciating this movie and the ideas it explores. I really don't find much criticism with this film; however, I must admit that I did not love it the way I do now on a first viewing. Not necessarily that I didn't understand what was going on but I don't think I got the point of it, especially with its very ambiguous ending, I felt like it came to a grinding halt at the time. Nevertheless, after viewing it a day later with fresh eyes, I had come to admire and appreciate this film in a way I have yet to with any other film. Regardless, the combination of Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s cinematography, PTA's direction and the use of the 70ml Lens make for one treat for the eyes, especially with its use of focus; it's masterful. Finally, yes Joaquin Phoenix, the late Phil Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are/were some of the best actors working today and were at the height of their respective careers in this film (the processing scene sticks out). I don't know if I've sold this film, but see it for yourself. It's a masterpiece"
362,The Master,10,3 June 2016,"""If you already know the answer to your question then why ask?""","What is there not to say about this film? ""The Master"", is directed by the great Paul Thomas Anderson, and stars Joaquin Phoenix, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Laura Dern, and many more talented individuals. The film follows the character of Freddie Quell, a WWII veteran loner. In a cabbage field he is accused of poisoning a man's drink with his homemade booze and is chased out of the work reservation. All by himself he jumps onto a ship sailing out at sea that just so happens to be occupied by a cult ran by their Master, Lancaster Dodd. Quell and Dodd soon start to develop a relationship and Dodd accepts Quell as a member of his cult. With Quell's unpredictable behavior there's no telling if he's truly found a place to officially settle down. ""The Master"" is quite possibly my favorite film from Paul Thomas Anderson, right next to ""Inherent Vice"" (2014), Magnolia (1999), and Hard Eight/Sydney (1996). When I first watched this film I honestly didn't get it and was quite disappointed. So I watched it again, and again, and again. Soon after over a dozen viewings of this film I can't help but just fall in love with it.Joaquin Phoenix, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, give the best performances in their entire career, hands down, period! Now many people call ""The Master"" ""that Scientology film."" Yes, this film is loosely based on Scientology, you see throughout, but I'd like to shy away from that because this film is so much more than just to be known as ""that Scientology film."" This is probably the most gorgeous looking film I've ever seen, I could believe if a theater showed this film in 3D because it's so damn beautiful. Paul Thomas Anderson makes films about characters who are separated or excluded from society, and this film demonstrates it so beautifully. Freddie Quell, is a WWII vet who can't function in a post war society due to his experiences in the war, and his own personal issues. Lancaster Dodd is the leader of a cult, and due to his beliefs he is excluded from society and by doing so he himself purposely excludes himself from society by sailing on his ship in the ocean. ""The Master"" shows what war can do to a man who is already psychologically ill, and how it can completely change their behavior and decision making skills. The film also demonstrates living in a post war society, innovation, and sex addiction. What really carries this film are the performances. Without these performances ""The Master"" would not be the film it is today. This film demands powerful performances because the script is so rich with detail and overall demands it. By far the best scene in the film is the ""informal processing"" scene. The reason why is because it features two of the greatest performances (Phoenix and Hoffman) brought to the big screen. Now this film has a lot of deleted scenes that didn't make the final cut. You can see the outtakes on the special features of the film, or on video. The outtakes are presented as a 20 minute short film that pretty much tells a story within the outtakes themselves. But what I'm trying to get at is that this film should've been left completely unedited because each outtake goes in depth in the film's story, and in detail about Dodd's unpublished work, to Quell getting his jacket from ""the Cause"". If those scenes were kept in the film it would be better than it is as of right now. I highly suggest any fan of Paul Thomas Anderson's to see this film, but I highly warn you, you might not understand the film and will need to watch it more than once. ""The Master"" is a beautifully directed, shot, and powerfully acted film that will be studied in film schools all around the world just like all of Kubrick's work. ""The Master"", is indeed a masterpiece."
363,The Master,10,17 May 2016,"Wonderful, great, challenging cinema.","What happens when a violent, alcoholic ex-marine drifter stows away on a yacht and is found by a charismatic, self-deluded cult leader? The two become the best of friends of course, and form a symbiotic relationship. The saint has found his sinner to cure, and the accident of it must mean that there are higher forces at work. At least in the mind of the master, who has been chosen to do great work, and so the bond is forged. Freddy undergoes ""processing"" a kind of suggestive hypnosis to recall past painful memories, some attempt to fix the present by changing the past in the mind...or something like that. Getting his frustrations out with this guy over hard home-made booze makes him feel good and there's free food, drink and pussy all round so he sticks around and has a great time, belonging for a while. His violent temper gives the master something to chastise, in turn giving the master opportunity to alleviate his mostly concealed anger, which he denies and covers up with pseudo- philosophical made-up ideas and rituals which only turn out to be self- defeating because they are simply denial, so when pesky critics start questioning him about his claims to cure cancer through mind time travel he hilariously loses his s--t, before quickly restraining himself, because he doesn't have the answers unless he's doing his song-and-dance and his followers are hypnotised. Thankfully he has his beloved beast Freddy to go out and do the dirty work for him without tainting his reputation, roughing up the unbelievers. He returns to tell the master of what he has done and is told off, giving the master his authority in a viciously logical yet kind of nice relationship.If it sounds like Lancaster Dodd (the master) is a villain, fear not, there are no villains in the film, just humans. He is a cynical charlatan, but like Freddy he's also basically trying to get by and survive, albeit misleading people along the way, or is he? I think one of the ways to find some kind of truth within yourself is to exert yourself in absurd endeavours to the point of mad frustration. And the rituals this group uses are indeed absurd. In one sequence the cult tries to cure Freddy through a series of mind games. Dodd's wife asks him what colour her eyes are, then commands him to ""make them black,"" then ""make them brown."" They're green, not any other colour, and yet they're also black, and brown because what is green? He's asked to pace between a wall and a window and describe them in different ways, and he reaches a critical point of frustration because no matter how many different ways he describes them they are in fact just a window and a wall, because that's what he's been taught, and no matter what they might actually be beyond that, to him alone they are just a window and a wall. The tree of possibility burns until there's just the trunk. As he paces back and forth he posits that he could leave any time he wants, but he is trapped there because it is his choice. His choice indeed. And that's it. Dodd preaches about rising above emotions, above the animal self, that we are not animals, but truly we are spirits exiting in eternity, and yet he cannot stop himself from lashing out when doubt and scepticism ruins his show. Freddy improves greatly within the cult, and yet when out in public confronted by a naysayer he tackles him to the ground and slaps him around, and he's back right where he started, all over again. So this cult is very useful indeed, if only to completely and utterly destroy all hope of being anything except what you are, which is a truth all spiritual paths can lead you to no matter how silly you find the practices. Religion comes in many forms. When a woman questions Dodd about his reasoning he can't say he doesn't have any so he loses it. ""Just because"" is the answer but most people don't like that because there must be a reason. He makes his own because he doesn't want toI don't know whether this film is anti-religion or for, but I don't think it's either. It's a double-edged sword for sure, on one hand Freddy is a martyr, whose very existence disproves everything that brings people and money to the cult. He cannot be cured because there is nothing to cure and his life of hard drinking, scrapping and generally stumbling around being incoherent is holy and pure and needs no cleansing, so then what is organised religion for? He could stay with the cult, and keep up the lie with the charade of trying to ""get better,"" or he could leave and the cult would remain a charade. What exactly is the cult? For sure it does help Freddy in a way, by reassuring him that he's not wrong, and he even makes fun of the ritual in the end while screwing a prostitute. In the end he's right back where he started, on the beach lying next to a pair of tits he's made in the sand.The film is funny, compelling, interesting, and beautifully shot and put together, with loads of great images and ideas, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Jaquin (I don't know how to spell it) Pheonix. I love it. I'd forgotten that Paul Thomas Anderson makes great films."
364,The Master,10,26 January 2016,Probably the best film and performance of the year.,"Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master is an excellent picture with some of the most interesting characters in recent time. It's tense and beautifully shot. The performances from the lead actors are absolutely incredible. The work that Joaquin does is incredible, I've not seen anything like this since Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. The editing and cinematography is great. It contains one of the greatest scenes in cinema history(The questioning scene between Dodd and Quell) and to watch their relationship throughout the film is tense and beautiful. The fact that Joaquin didn't win at the Oscar is a shame, even though he lost against Daniel day's ""Lincoln"". Overall a great movie, even though the plot might be a bit thin. 9/10"
365,The Master,5,8 December 2015,Disappointing,"I gave it 5 stars because I managed to watch it from the beginning until the end. What kept me watching were good performances of the two main actors and a beautiful photography. Other than that, the movie was slow, without direction and without any deeper message. Many long scenes with almost no dialogue are probably meant to be thought-provoking, but I could not detect any meaning in any of them. There is no real plot and nothing much happens throughout the whole movie. Even if it was loosely based on Scientology, the focus of the movie was nowhere near the cult itself; and we are repeatedly subjected to the main character's issues and his relationship with the Master. Really disappointing."
366,The Master,10,14 September 2015,Anderson is the Master.,"The Master (2012): Dir: Paul Thomas Anderson / Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Ambyr Childers, Jesse Plemons: Intriguing drama about taking control of one's life. It stars Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell whose post war experience has been an anxiety filled struggle. Mixing poisonous booze has landed him in trouble until he stows away on a yacht. On board he meets Landcaster Dodd whose daughter is getting married. He is a spiritualist who introduces Quell to ""the Cause"", which is said to be a reference to Scientology. What is interesting is that the film isn't a promotion of any religion. It sees the strains of being part of a ritual whereas your life doesn't fit. Director Paul Thomas Anderson is a master all his own with such greats as Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. Phoenix delivers the agony of a life scarred by war and a girlfriend he left long ago. Committing to ""the Cause"" brings agitation in its routine practices that throws him into a rage until he reaches a realization where freedom can be possible. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant as Dodd whose spirituality brings protest as well as a book. Amy Adams plays his wife whose frustration rises with regards to Quell's drinking. Ambyr Childers plays Dodd's daughter who finds Quell intimidating. Jesse Plemons plays Landcaster's son who is not entirely enthused with the lifestyle at hand. Spellbinding examination of paths we can follow regardless how laughable the practices. In the end we learn that if we cannot master our own life then we cannot expect anyone else to do so for us. Score: 10 / 10"
367,The Master,9,21 July 2015,The Master sucked me in and never let go until the end,"The Master sucked me in immediately with the beautiful shots and unsettling nature of Joaquin Phoenix's character Freddie.The story starts off slow, you get to know the characters, but as it unfolds before you, it sucks you in. The story of Freddie and how he is going through this world was interesting, what he was doing was interesting. I could never take my eyes of Joaquin Phoenix during any scene.The acting was amazing. Joaquin Phoenix was something else. I couldn't stop looking at him, ever scene unveiled something about his character and he brought it to life. Philip Seymour Hoffman was also great, he stole the screen whenever he was there. Whenever they were both on screen I didn't know who to look at. During the movie I never once felt like I was watching actors, I was watching characters.The camera work was great, there were really nice shots during open area and conversations. The visuals kept me in the movie even during some of the more slow scenes.I did not think I was going to like this movie as much as I did. I love Paul Thomas Anderson, but the early trailers looked boring to me. The movie I must say is completely different, it's engaging, interesting, and wonderful. I will never doubt Paul Thomas Anderson again, this is an amazing movie."
368,The Master,7,6 May 2015,I have yet to master The Master,"There is a certain difficulty in reviewing a film like The Master. It's hard to figure out if it's a good film or not, because in doing so you're required to thoroughly analyze it, which isn't the purpose of a review. In a review I can only give an overview of the plot, share some of my observations and my opinion of the film. SoWhat is The Master about? It's about many things or rather: it can be about many things depending on how you read it. Among other things, it's about a cult/movement; it's about psychology; about the effect of war on the individual (PTSD among other things); it's about the complex relationship between two men; it's about the cult versus the world; about manipulation; it's about the master-follower relationship, etc. The main character in all this is Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a Naval veteran returning from WWII. After he stumbles through daily life, he accidentally comes across Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the leader of a cult (or 'movement') known as The Cause. He becomes intrigued by Dodd and decides to follow him. Thus begins a long and complex relationship between the two.Leaving the plot out, the things I can more easily qualify as good or bad (good in this case) are the performances by the leading trio (Phoenix, Hoffman and Adams), the cinematography and Jonny Greenwood's score. These are things I can use to judge this film a good one. Phoenix (after a four years without a film credit to his name) returns to the field of acting with a fantastic performance. Although his performance could be judged to be of the 'I am acting!' variety, I'd say it's of the tour de force variety and he always stays in character. Just like in Doubt, Hoffman gives another impressive and multifaceted performance. Where in Doubt he had to constantly keep the audience guessing (is he guilty or innocent of child molestation?), here he has to make the characters (and the audience) believe he truly understands what he's saying, while simultaneously hinting he's 'making it up as he goes along'. Amy Adams is also one of the most interesting and varied actresses today. Even though her role in The Master is limited, it's unlike anything she's done and there's an interesting twist regarding her husband-wife relationship with Hoffman. Jonny Greenwood's score is just as intriguing as his score for Anderson's There Will Be Blood, utilizing percussion and strings to create interesting soundscapes. It's one of those scores that just fits the film.But only discussing these aspects of The Master is like discussing Last Year at Marienbad without mentioning its plot and the difficulty in interpreting it. As mentioned, I'll share my observations about The Master. I won't devolve into analysis, however  you can read articles like this and this for that, if you're interested.It's a film whose screenplay was the subject of much critique and even though I can see why (Anderson was inspired by so many diverse things that the finished film seems like a series of random events), but the script also has many things going for it. For instance, many events in the film tie in with later events. Consider the many times Lancaster Dodd asks Quell where they've met before; Quell's sand sculpture with which the film also ends; how Quell emulates Dodd by 'processing' a woman he's sleeping with, etc.Ultimately, the chances you'll enjoy The Master are rather high, simply because of the fantastic acting, music and cinematography. Whether you'll think of The Master as something more will depend on how much time and effort you're willing to spend on analyzing and dissecting it. Did I like The Master? Yes, I did. I liked it for many reasons, one of them being that I didn't completely understand it after it was over. I didn't understand it, but I didn't feel like I had watched something meaningless. This may be an inherently wrong reason to like a film, but 2001: A Space Oddysey wouldn't be so interesting if it had divulged its secrets during the first viewing. It's the film that reportedly made Rock Hudson shout out in the theater: ""Will someone please tell me what the hell this is about"" and now 2001 is one of the world's most famous films. Or consider Last Year at Marienbad again. Its director, Alain Resnais, once said his film has no meaningbut people are still talking about it even now. Whether The Master will have a similar fate is something only time will tell"
369,The Master,10,27 March 2015,Wow!,"The Master is written and directed by the master of film Paul Thomas Anderson. Starring Joquain Phoenix as an ex navy man struggling to find his way after the war, luckily that's when he finds Lancaster Dodd fantastically performed by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The war has just ended but it's not sunshine and light for Freddie quell (joquain Phoenix) who spends his time conckoting his own alcohol, subsequently drinking it and being promiscuous, this irrational behavior leads society to reject him. One night Freddie stows away on a boat only to find himself faced with Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) the man they call ""the master"" he welcomes the vulnerable Freddie aboard not only his boat but his religion, ""the cause"". As time goes by Dodd and his family try to turn Freddie's life around with their unusual techniques as the question rages is he past help. The master is one of those films you either love or hate, luckily I adore it. Critics are inevitable with this piece of filmaking, the main attack point will be that it has no narrative, while that may be the case to a certain extent that doesn't mean there is no story! There are not dramatic plot twist throughout but there is a message. I believe the message to be that religion is an extremely dangerous thing and the religion prays on the weak and ultimately won't help them. The main focus is the relationship between the two men, there dedication to each other as the world tries to pull them apart. Every detail of the master is expertly put together, from the 1950's design to the fantastically deranged score by Johnny Greenwood. The one thing that makes this film tick however is the acting the two leading men give outstanding performances, they are not the only ones with amy adams portraying Lancaster Dodds straight laced wife perfectly.I could talk for hours on this brilliant film, it is so full of emotion and meaning. Some people will say it's just weird, perverted and lackluster but if you are a lucky person and see into it you will love it."
370,The Master,7,4 March 2015,Another good movie by P. T. Anderson,"It's a strange and unusual movie portraying the difficulties that ex-soldiers have in relations with the everyday life after the end of the war.In situations of mind confusion and unrest, they are seduced by the strong minded new cult leaders in a quest for mind rest.This is what happened to Freedie Quell (Joaquim Pheonix), an ex-soldier with an old and unresolved love, with drinking and violence problems.He gets sucked in by the very persuasive Lancaster Dod (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), and with time becoming his right hand man.The performances of both actors are extremely good, well worth the Oscars. Amy Addams is also very good as the Master's wife.It's another good movie by Paul Thomas Anderson."
371,The Master,7,2 March 2015,Reel Look: 'The Master',"""If you figure a way to live without serving a master, any master, then let the rest of us know, will you? For you'd be the first person in the history of the world."" Paul Thomas Anderson's 'The Master' is a 2012 American drama film that is opaque as it is mentally challenging. Shot almost entirely on 65mm film stock and making it the first feature length fiction film to be shot and released in 70mm since Kenneth Branagh's 1996 'Hamlet', tells the story of sex-obsessed alcoholic World War II veteran trying to find his place after the pangs of battle. Does he eventually find his niche in the world in which he can finally belong to become his own master? Let's take a look. Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is struggling to adjust to the post-war society around him while also suffering from PTSD. He becomes a portrait photographer at a local department store but later gets fired for having an inebriated fight with a customer. Freddie then goes on to find work at a cabbage farm but then is later chased off for accidentally poisoning an elderly worker by making him try his moonshine with the secret ingredient of paint thinner. From there the intoxicated Freddie seeks refuge on a yacht; unbeknownst to him is owned by Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the leader of a philosophical movement known as ""The Cause"". Upon being discovered, Freddie and Dodd form a relationship whereas eventually Dodd is the only person he can actually trust and relate to because he sees something in him. Dodd invites him to his daughter's wedding and at the reception tells everyone the story of the one who powered over the mighty dragon: the master. This nuance in the film is indeed referencing Dodd's future mentorship towards Freddie and the dragon of inner hurts and rage he must face within him. Dodd takes a liking to Freddie's moonshine brew and later Dodd begins an exercise with him called Processing, resulting in a flurry of disturbing psychological inquiries aimed at vanquishing his past traumas. Freddie does not open up easily at first, but after Dodd stops him for not cooperating he then tells him to proceed because he is finally ready to get his frustrations out from being bottled up inside for so long: how his father dies, his mother is institutionalized, how he may have had an incestuous relationship with his aunt and how he abandoned the love of his life named Doris, of whom she wrote him during the war. We also get to meet Dodd's wife Peggy (Amy Adams) who is not her saccharine self in this film but rather a firm, no-nonsense woman as she sees Freddie as hopeless and mentally unreachable. Dodd is eventually arrested for illegally practicing medicine without the proper licensing and is thrown in jail along with Freddie in the opposite cell, of whom he assaulted the police officers. Freddie smashes the toilet in the cell in a rage and beats his head against the bunk as Dodd tells him to calm down, which causes him to accuse Dodd that everything he taught him was a lie and that he was a fake. Upon release sometime afterwards, they reconcile as Freddie submits to more additional exercises involving ""The Cause"", which he eventually passes due to making him increasingly angry and frustrated with repetitions from failing previous tests. Freddie and Dodd soon after travel to Phoenix, Arizona upon the release of Dodd's new book. Freddie then becomes upset upon learning what the book entails and becomes violent. He eventually goes to reunite with Doris after a seven year absence in Alabama only to discover she is married and has started a family. Disappointed but satisfied for her sake, he leaves. One night in a movie theater he has a ""vision"" where Dodd calls him on a telephone to come visit him in Britain. He does, and then Dodd tells him he does not want to see him again, as he has done all he can for him.This film is dark, vague and not for everyone, yet somehow demands more viewings due to the complicated structure on which it is based. We never see Freddie's past but meet him right where he is as an unsociable veteran with a hidden inner rage. Seeing Freddie shed a tear as Dodd serenades him with 'Slow Boat to China' near the end of the film is, homosexual overtones aside, heartbreaking and poignant all at once. It is as if Dodd is saying that he taught Freddie all he could and now it is up to him to face life on his own to become his own master of his own future. This film may be dark at times but is poetic as well. Watching this film is like watching a car crash in slow motion. The psyche and inner desires of Freddie are obviously beyond anyone's reach, shockingly even for him. Dodd did what he could for the time he was given, and he did not give up on him even though Freddie wanted so badly to give up on himself. It was Dodd that pressed and pushed him to become something more than he could ever hope to achieve; to be his own man, his own might and in all retrospect, his own master. RIP Mr. Hoffman."
372,The Master,7,11 February 2015,enigmatic,"The Master is, on one level, a study of cult demagoguery. Seymour Hoffman as the cult leader is perfect in a quietly ferocious performance. As for Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell, there are simply no words. Perhaps 'sublime' comes closest. Completely plausible as an incurable alcoholic prone to violence and mental disorder, he is simply mesmerizing. He imbibes the character to the point of altered posture when standing. Amy Adams is the icily assured wife and her pale skin and blue eyes beguile, projecting an innocence that is at odds with her heartless observations and fanatical loyalty. Why are Freddie and Dodd so tied to each other? What, exactly, are the aims of The Cause? I have no idea, but suspect that there are no authentic answers - enjoyment of the discussion of these questions is the actual answer. Freddie drifts dangerously, and finally finds belonging in something bigger and more menacing than himself. He craves human connection, but fears containment, and it is a tension that can never be resolved. He lies down with sand people, knowing all the while they are not real. And perhaps that is the question that the film interrogates - is a comforting dream better than an unbearable reality?"
373,The Master,10,7 February 2015,Masterwork.,"Quite the religious experience, pun intended. A lot of filmgoers and die-heart fans of P.T.A are torn over this movie, but if there is anything to mention of what this film truly masters, is it's visual scope. It's arrestingly beautiful. It doesn't have the exuberance of Robert Elswit, but this isn't the type of film that called for exuberance to begin with. The Master forces you to sit back and take it all in. But, common to all P.T.A films, the acting, once again, shines so piercingly bright. Phoenix is mesmerizing, Amy Adams is breathtaking... Phillip Seymour Hoffman, gloriously chews up all of the scenery. I truly consider this his swan song. His last incredible performance.. and not because it was his last Oscar nomination. The Master, also, very fluidly picks up where ""There Will Be Blood"" left off. It exists to heal the open wounds we were left with. By the time the credits roll, you'll feel unexpectedly warm inside, having gone on this journey with our hero, Freddie. Well done, P.T.A."
374,The Master,10,7 December 2014,"The Master, you will be thinking about this one","I was pleasantly surprised by this film, many times over. I had heard all the raving reviews, but after There Will Be Blood, I was not sure Paul Thomas Anderson could do any better. He hasn't; There Will Be Blood is his masterpiece by far, and I doubt he can ever make another film so perfectly. The Master is not better than There Will Be Blood, but it does not need to be. It is a film unlike There will Be Blood, and it has an intensity and tenderness all its own. The Master is a film for the patient, those who can appreciate all the quiet moments that make up a film. It greatness and splendor come from its amazing performances, and the impeccable nature of the script and dialogue. It is a film, that at the end, had me satisfied and longing for more all at once, it had me angry and sorrowful. It is not a film that explains itself or answers it own questions, it is for those who dare to have a film challenge them, and it is one of the finest works by a true master, Paul Thomas Anderson. From the opening scene we are introduced to a character, but given almost no information about him. The beauty of our introduction to Freddie Quell lies within the performance given by Joaquin Phoenix. He is sporadic, quizzical, abnormal, quiet, and walks and looks as though the world is either baffling him, or he has it completely figured out. Over the course of the film I think he bounces back between the two thoughts, or better yet he is wrestling with those two thoughts throughout the film. His performance of Quell goes far beyond a character in turmoil. Quell is a haunted soul. The drinking is not to quiet his mind, but to try and drown his spirit. He is lost, and does things impulsively and without guidance, and pushes his own sense of reality until it explodes in his face. This does not exactly change when he meets Lancaster Dodd, so much as he encounters a force equal to his own, yet severely different. Quell is a raging bull, barely conscious of his own destruction and havoc he causes others; Dodd is the matador, in control of the situation, taming the bull, but the control could be taken at a moment's notice. Dodd, portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, may be one of the most involved and complex characters to grace the screen in the 21st century. His motives, relationships, family, and beliefs are a mystery, and depending on how you interpret the film, the answers given differ. Some may say he was just a scientist, who become fanatical and was able to talk people into believing his theories. You might say he was completely insane and believed all of the things he spoke on, and truly thought he had everything figured out. I am still not sure how I view him, but I think that is part of the excellence of this film. On some level, I think he was a person who wanted to see how far he could push people. He liked to keep everyone on the edge, and see how long before he could make them step off. Quell, was perhaps the first person he realized, had already stepped off the edge, and was floating in ambivalence. He is also a fearful character. This is what drove his drinking, he was afraid of almost everything. Keeping people at a distance, and commanding over them, convincing them, all helped to mask his fear. He was a man who was afraid of snakes, but could not stop himself from grabbing its tail and seeing how long he could keep from being bit. This is best exemplified by the scenes with Dodd and his wife, a scary good Amy Adams. She does so much with her time on screen, which on the whole is not a lot compared to her costars, but this only cements her character and performance more deeply. In the scene in the bathroom, we see how much control she has over her husband, and how afraid he is of her. She often speaks for her husband in a way that ends the current conversation. She recognizes the delicate and flimsy nature of the life that they are leading, and she moves all the pieces in the background to keep it from crumbling. ""Nothing strengthens authority so much as silence.""- Leonardo da Vinci. On the whole the thing that made this film so intriguing to me was the dialogue. It is some of the best, intimate, cryptic, and insightful dialogue to be jammed into one film. My favorite example is either Dodd and Quell having their first session together, or when they are in jail together. It matches the feel of the film and the type of characters we are witnessing. Looking back the film would be disjointed if the dialogue was anywhere close to being continuous, but instead its sporadic and varying nature fits the characters like a glove. The movie is also shot from a variety of distances, and on the whole the cinematography is nothing short of excellent. The camera loves to be close, but also distant and sweeping when it needs to be. This is one of those films that prove that not everything in a movie needs to be said, not everything explained, and not every question answered. The second the film ended my mind was whirling with thoughts and emotions, and I loved it. This is a challenging film, but I would expect nothing less when facing a master like P.T. Anderson."
375,The Master,8,3 September 2014,"For if you figure a way to live without serving a master, any master, then let us know, will you?","The Master.Verdict: 8/10;Paul Thomas Anderson never fails to deliver. This is a typical movie of his in many, many ways  long, slow scenes, impeccable actor performances and a constantly moving camera to mention a few. The master in it's nature and fundamental idea doesn't seem as challenging to me as did Magnolia, There Will be Blood or Boogie Nights. The Master grasps the viewer with mystery, it possibly raises more questions then it answers, but in a beautifully guided kind of way that makes you almost demand for more. After all this is a movie about a search for oneself, about religion and something that keeps us all going  the master, whoever it might be.The movie revolves around Freddie Quell, a lost and lonely, borderline sex addict with no temper, who is first introduced to us coming back from the Navy after WWII. Freddie is by all means a troubled man, he is quite aggressive and it seems like he is mentally and psychologically lost. All this in theory makes him a perfect victim/friend for Dodd, i.e. the Master, who, with cold grace, befriends Freddie through his ideology. The loyal, lost soul that is Freddie Quell gives into this ideology and takes on the Master's beliefs, however not because he found sense and meaning in it, but more because he wants to be a part of something, he wants to belong. The charisma and subtleness of Hoffman's character does not subtract from this, turning Freddie at time into a loyal dog, reacting aggressively to anyone who would disagree with Dodd.With some references to Scientology, the master's view is based on a revelation he had that people, after death, are reincarnated to their new bodies. His beliefs were based around the idea of some mental time travel, where one can find answers to his present problems by solving these problems earlier in life or before birth. These ideas are portrayed through countless arguments, sessions, weird mind exercises and talks in which he conveys his views and tries to persuade others. To me the irony of this surreal cult or religion is that, if you look closely, these people are not nearly as crazy as PTA depicts them. Their beliefs make them look and sound almost insane, and there are a few scenes in the movie that show that none of them can back any of their arguments up by even a single fact. But this is not the point here, this cult, this religion, led by the Master, that just simply seems to know all the answers, is a very ironic parallel to today's religions. To me, (and for now) these religions are beautiful stories, they make sense and at the same time they don't. Millions believe them in, yet there are no evidence or facts that these stories ever took place. So maybe who are we to judge what is surreal and what isn't.What they however give us is home, a sense of meaning and belonging that is very hard to survive without. And this is what kept Freddie there. Freddie is in no way stupid, at times he seems to love and hate the beliefs of the cult, however a practical man he is, he simply can't get his head around the idea that these beliefs are made up. However it feels like sometimes he doesn't want to question anything, he got this sense of belonging, being a part of a family and even seems to get some of their ideas, only to find himself getting more frustrated and puzzled as more and more questions arise. In their last conversation, the Master conveys what to me is the fundamental message of the whole movie: For if you figure a way to live without serving a master, any master, then let us know, will you? For you'd be the first person in the history of the world. And this is what this movie is really about, again, about belonging, about having something or someone in life to live for. No matter how silly and surreal and stupid that something or someone might be, it's what keeps all of us going each day. In a parallel to one of my favorite Bob Dylan's songs: Gotta Serve Somebody, it goes something like that: you may be the devil, you may be the lord, but you'd always have to serve somebody."
376,The Master,4,24 August 2014,Lacking 'There Will Be Blood' qualities...,"Paul Thomas Anderson transforms Joaquin Phoenix into an unstable, violent alcoholic and Philip Seymour Hoffman into L. Ron Hubbard circa 1950. 'The Master' is a film about love and the turmoil of a broken heart set against the backdrop of post-World War II America. Freddy Quell ( Phoenix ) is a drifting veteran returning home from war in the Pacific with a drinking problem so severe that he spikes his drinks with paint thinner and any other chemicals he can get his hands on. Lancaster Dodd ( Hoffman ) is a writer-turned-futurist/pseudo-psychoanalyst whose hucksterish movement is just starting to gain traction. The two men meet by chance and share some of Freddie's chemical-laced drinks. Dodd instantly sees an opportunity to try his psycho- analytic techniques on a wounded soul. It turns out that some of Dodd's treatment ( which he dubs ""processing"" ) actually helps Freddie to recognize the root of his troubles: a regretful, unfulfilled love. Freddie left behind a special girl in order to join the navy and thereby fight in the war. In the fog of hard-drinking that followed, he lost sight of his basic emotional needs. After this initial breakthrough, Freddie becomes fiercely loyal to Dodd and his ideas, he begins to violently defend against any challenge or criticism of Dodd's methods. This blind devotion produces a genuine affection for Freddie in Dodd's mind and heart. Dodd's wife ( Amy Adams ) is skeptical that Freddie's alcoholism can be managed and tries to convince her husband to shun the violent drifter. Much of 'The Master' is not as ambiguous as critics have repeatedly claimed; Freddy has many crude sexual thoughts and expressions that are obviously presented to point out his need for the love and affection of a woman. In fact the movie is book-ended with these needs blatantly displayed. You can clearly see the writer/director's intent to state that Freddie never needed Dodd's treatment, he simply needed what Marvin Gaye called 'Sexual Healing'. There has also been a great deal of speculation amongst critics of a homoerotic connection between Dodd and Quell which I find to be absurd. The genuine caring that Dodd feels for Quell is a blend of a.) an appreciation for steadfast loyalty and b.) a gratefulness for the opportunity to successfully make a breakthrough with his techniques. A breakthrough that, in the end, produces an expansion in Dodd's movement across the Atlantic. The acting in this film is great and compelling, Phoenix plays his character with a physical bent that gives him a broken quality perfectly matched by Hoffman's authoritative over-confidence. This is not Paul Thomas Anderson's best film. 'The Master' is a long experience with more than a few scenes which could have been cut. In essence, it's a director's film which will alienate many film goers. Anyone familiar with Scientology and its historical roots will be disappointed with the bits and pieces that are used; there is a great potential Hubbard biopic buried in this movie. Despite these flaws, it is a movie that I would watch again thanks to the great performances."
377,The Master,10,5 August 2014,I Implore You to Drink a Quart of Paint Thinner Before Watching,"You gotta get on the same page as the actors to really connect with the important message here. That will require a heavy dose of paint thinner to loosen the brain structure just enough for it to accept the coming transformation. Some people call this a cult experience. I call it Common Sense Squared, that is to the nth power, where n=2. But to get the sense, to really get it fully, you can't just sniff airplane glue and expect enlightenment, no, you must drink a quart of paint thinner and then you will truly be prepared to see God. But not just see God, no, you will actually become Godlike, it's all just so freaking meaningful and complex, the poignancy of the aging nude bodies splashed about, the vulgarity of the Master(bater), it all adds up to the single most important Hollywood film presentation since Plan 9 From Outer Space."
378,The Master,10,25 July 2014,Magnificent,"This is a tour de force for PTA, Hoffman, Phoenix, and Adams. Holy crap this guy makes good movies.This is a very complex story and dynamic, not for the faint of heart. I grew up around cultish people and understood a lot of the lingo and ongoing power struggle that's not necessarily intuitive. May require multiple viewings, or not, depending on how much you like Phoenix's character.This is personally my favorite Phillip Seymour Hoffman role. He is one of my favorite actors and he will be missed terribly.Amy Adams delivers one of her strongest performances ever, in my humble opinion. She absolutely owns this film with a dead-on portrayal of a queen bee cult mom. She isn't just along for the ride, she's driving letting Hoffman and Phoenix get as weird as their characters need to be.Phoenix is a force to be reckoned with in this movie as well. He completely and utterly devotes himself to Freddy and in turn imbues him with a sort of pathos that makes his character worthwhile instead of just a hollow portrayal of random psychosis. The movie is about the connection between him and Hoffman, how they are both monsters who occupy different arenas. One looks and behaves like a college professor, the other like a transient addict, but in bonding over Freddy's magical concoctions, you see how Freddy is need of the stability men like Hoffman's master provide, while Hoffman is in need of someone to entertain him. Both broken and flawed men but together they are somehow more than the sum of their parts.This is an excellent film. I highly recommend it."
379,The Master,8,24 July 2014,Unexpected journey.,"The movie that is ""The Master"" is a story that one could not begin to fathom by reading the likes of whatever brief descriptions that you have glanced upon in regards to it. It is a record that follows the path of one troubled man that happens to serve in the navy during the world war 2. A man who through his experiences is troubled even further as he goes through life in the post world war era. Somewhere throughout the picture, the man that the story has been following, encounters another most peculiar man. The two form a most unusual relationship with one another that is both unconventional and yet entirely affectionate. While one tries to guide the other, they both in turn learn a great deal. This movie displayed to me, two of the most exceptionable acting performances i've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. Yet, the writer merely uses these excellent performances as a conduit for what is truly being conveyed, the message, principle and moral of a story."
380,The Master,2,9 July 2014,What a mess.,"This movie about Lancaster Dodd, a man who is forming a spiritual movement called ""The Cause,"" had several major problems for me. First of all I think that any founder of such a movement must have a certain charisma and I found Philip Hoffman (as Dodd) to be far from inspiring. Dodd bills himself as a polymath, but I saw little evidence of that. His persona did not engage me at all. Maybe this was one of the points--how could such a man develop a following? Are people so hungry for someone to tell them what to do that they will bite for any nonsense?Then there is the case of Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), who has just returned from WWII with an industrial strength case of PTSD. Phoenix's acting is so over the top that his antics got on my nerves very early on and I winced every time he appeared. Quell stows away on one of Dodd's yachts in route from San Francisco to New York and, instead of tossing him off the ship, Dodd bonds with him. Maybe Dodd saw him as an enforcer, since Quell would physically attack any naysayer. On the other hand, maybe Dodd viewed Quell as the ultimate challenge--if he could bring him into the fold, then he could consider anyone as a potential convert. However, Dodd seemed to concentrate on wealthy converts, so his relationship with Quell remained a mystery to me. I always wonder about guys like Dodd. Do they really believe in the silly messages they are putting out?The basic idea of what Dodd is offering is the use of intense interrogations and hypnotism to bring up one's past (way past) and correct corruptions to errors made in the evolutionary chain that were preventing the subject from achieving perfection. Or some such mumbo jumbo, the exact tenants of The Cause were never clear to me. Dodd says errors could occur over trillions of years ago--apparently science was of little concern to him. As one of Dodd's son's said, ""He makes it up as he goes along.""There are interminable repetitions that Dodd uses on his subjects, like having people repeat their names over and over. But the worst of this was having Quell move back and forth from a window to a wall over and over and report what he felt. At one time Quell says that the window feels like a window, at which point Dodd says that it is a window. This ritual may have had some value in the philosophy of The Cause (of which I could see little of), but I tell you it gets plenty tedious for a viewer.This movie made such little impression on me that I cannot now remember how it ends, and I just watched it last night. I blame writer/director Anderson for this chaotic mess."
381,The Master,,16 June 2014,P.T.A. gives a creative story that doesn't make it all the way through excellence.,"Paul Thomas Anderson has always been a brilliant filmmaker. In his film 'The Master' he tackles a religious cult similar to Scientology and how it started out in the 1950's. Joaquin Phoneix gives his most crazy performance as Freddie, a WW II navy solider who just made it home to the states and is having some bizarre issues. He is a very aggressive man who has strange emotions and is sexually driven. Clearly he suffers from a form of post traumatic stress disorder. Freddie soon meets Lancaster Dodd(Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who is starting a new ""religion."" That religion just so happens to be very similar Scientology, and Lancaster Dodd is very much like L.Ron Hubbard. Freddie is soon brainwashed into the cult Lancaster and his militant wife Peggy (Amy Adams) have started and it causes Freddie to become militant as well. This film was very uncomfortable at times. Freddie's sexual desires are quite common and are very graphic and strange at times. The plot is very interesting, but it doesn't really go anywhere. It just shows how the cult evolves throughout the film and how it affects Freddie. Freddie was a very interesting character. The only problem is that he didn't grow! He stayed the same throughout the film and got old after a while. Joaquin Phoneix gave an excellent performance and was electrifying at times, especially in an intense jail cell scene where he goes biz arc. Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams were strong as militants determined to get their beliefs shared. Paul Thomas Anderson has always had a thing for creativity. This film may be his most complex film since 'Magnolia' but doesn't finish or move right. It could have been much better and is a bit overdone at some points. Much more drama and character transitions were needed, and Paul Thomas Anderson should have shot the film in a more complex way instead of a few magnificent shots with the rest being boring and bland."
382,The Master,9,26 March 2014,Reflections on an under-appreciated film that is destined to have a long shelf life.,"Once again, here I sit with my laptop opened in front of me inspired to record my reflections about another Paul Thomas Anderson movie. Let me share a secret with you. I watched this film without realizing that it was a P.T. Anderson production. I had the movie on my hard drive and watched it purely on my slightest recollection that this movie should be good. My expectations were met and I found my appreciation for the direction, design, cinematography, and story telling piqued. I felt vindicated that my aesthetic senses remained consistent to previous stimuli of Anderson. The film gave me an unintended kick in the gut as we watch Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The performance he gave us in ""Magnolia"" creeps into my vapid moments when I am prone to daydreaming. While watching ""The Master"", I am constantly reminded of his amazing range, comparing the two roles of an enabling health provider with an all loving, slightly psychotic cult leader. Not to sound trite but Hoffman will be sorely missed. On the opposite spectrum, we witness the rebirth of Joaquin Phoenix's acting career. Playing the lead character whose life provides the context of the story, he gives a performance that allows us to feel every writhing moment of his tormented life. Once again, the ubiquitous Amy Adams does yeoman work while receiving minimal accolades. I love seeing Rami Malek show up in more and more films. His performance as Cpl. Merriell ""Snafu"" Shelton in ""The Pacific"" gave him instant credit as a budding actor. Same goes for Jesse Plemons who helped bring the series ""Breaking Bad"" to a conclusion with an exclamation point rather than a period. Paul Thomas Anderson shoots the movie on a 65mm Kodak film that had not been used in a full length motion picture for 16 years. The film stock is designed to withstand the rigors of the 70 mm Panavision projection. Every main character records closeups that exposes every imperfection on their Hollywood sculpted appearances. Phoenix morphs. into a man with poor posture, a scrawny physique, ptosis (a drooping eyelid) while the camera emphasizes his natural micro-cleft lip. The only thing missing was a mole with an ingrown hair. Anderson's trademark dramatic scenarios stand true as the family structure is replaced by community, the protagonist is chock full of flaws, and a plethora of symbolic metaphors are dropped as if they were part of an Easter egg hunt. All the while the actors are allowed to act, and improvisations are welcomed by the director. Perhaps a sign that Paul Anderson is mastering his trade when the movie does not dawdle and the production clocks in at a svelte 144 minutes. As much as we appreciate Stanley Kubrick, we do not need another Barry Lyndon. The Master is a directorial masterpiece whose actors breathe life into a rather flaccid story. Here is another secret, I did not realize that story was a bit dull until I needed to summarize my reflection of an under-appreciated film that is destined to have a long shelf life."
383,The Master,9,21 March 2014,A troubled veteran searches for a place to belong.,"Freddie Quell(Joaquin Phoenix), a WWII veteran suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, is a hard drinking loner with a volatile personality in search for some semblance of family or just a place to belong. Freddie suffers breakdowns and let downs and seems to be fixated on sex. Freddie does have a talent in photography as well as making alcoholic drinks out of things like Lysol and paint thinner. When really down and out and pretty much hitting rock bottom, Quell finds temporary shelter as he stumbles onto a ship occupied by Lancaster Dodd(Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his wife(Amy Adams). Dodd, who calls himself the Master, is a charismatic leader collecting material for his second book on intense exercises that are believed to clear latent emotions. Dodd has a cult following and Freddie is made to feel like he has found an extended family of sorts as he joins Dodd's followers. The troubled former sailor goes through the rigors of Dodd's experimental mind opening exercises. Mrs. Dodd becomes angered and tells her husband that Quell is a waste of time, for all he seems to live for is boozing.It is obvious that Phoenix dug deep and summoned his talents to play this character so fervently. The late Hoffman is brilliant and humorous. THE MASTER runs a bit over two hours and is rated R for graphic sexual content, language and female full frontal nudity. Also featured in the cast: Amy Ferguson, Ambyr Childers, Rami Malek, W. Earl Brown, Price Carson and Laura Dern. Kudos to director and writer Paul Thomas Anderson."
384,The Master,9,9 March 2014,Great Work of Cinema!,"Paul Thomas Anderson's latest, The Master is one of those films that will critically divide people. Some people will despise it and others like myself, will like it very much. This film will likely take an psychological and emotional toll on you and this film has an originality factor of 10/10. Anderson has a fascinating view of detail and this film shows it. The core of this film is the brave acting, but it features lush cinematography and the details to the time period are almost perfect. I thought for the entire film, I was in 1950 myself.Anderson's film is about a World War Two veteran named Freddie Quell who is a drifter, an alcoholic, and has breakdowns. When he finds this cult that involves closing out his emotions, Freddie is compelled to join this cult.The actors in the film took high risks to do these roles. I have never seen characters like these on screen especially the portrayal of Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie. Then again, Phoenix is known to take high risks. But such a bravado performance. Philip Seymour Hoffman adds another extraordinary role to his collection. Amy Adams does a good job here, but I didn't really understand her role in the film.Overall, this film is what makes me believe in the future of cinema. It shows these kind of films can still be made. In my book, Anderson has never made a bad film that I haven't seen and the Master continues that streak. He directed and expertly written a great movie. People claims it's based on Scientology, but who knows. I still have not completely understood this movie just yet, so another viewing may be in store. I rate this film 9/10."
385,The Master,10,16 February 2014,Loved it the same way I love a good novel,"I'm not a particular fan of Paul Thomas Anderson, but seeing the preview of Phoenix and Hoffman's (God rest his soul) performances in the trailer made me determined to get my hands on a copy. To be honest, this isn't the kind of film I will watch over and over again, but that's because it's not made solely for entertainment. It's also not for the average viewer; they will probably find it boring and confusing.The two times I did watch The Master start-to-finish, I paid great attention, and afterwards, I discussed it at great length. I enjoyed pondering on the story's details the same way I enjoy finishing a book with literary merit. Several of the monologues, dialogue exchanges and actions of characters are fascinating because of their ambiguity. Are they completely random, or do they connect with another meaning in the story? Are either of the two main men likable or admirable in any way? These are the kinds of questions I found myself asking.If you're turned off by the L Ron Hubbard-inspired character or Scientology simile in general, I can assure you that so much of the film focuses on mood and human interaction, I quickly forgot about that aspect."
386,The Master,10,21 January 2014,Not for the average film goer.,"Like my title suggest, this film is not for the average film goer who will want to see a movie at any of your major movie theaters. That's not to knock those people or anything but this film is different. It's what separates classical music fans from your average Billboard Hot 100 pop radio fan.Now that, that has been established, I would like to say that this film struck a chord with me. It is an incredibly beautifully shot film, shot in 65mm over broad landscapes makes it even more beautiful. Most people will say that the acting is the best part of the movie and I would like to say that it's not the ""best"" part of the movie but it is another piece of the film that makes it a modern day classic that will be misunderstood by today's modern film goer that's looking for the Christoper Nolan like entertainment. PTA doesn't aim to entertain you as much as he looks to make art out of moving pictures. There's nothing flashy and no explosions in this film to keep you on the edge of your seat. It's like reading a well written novel. You're going to enjoy the film as long as you are willing to put in the work of getting to understand it. Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman pull off incredible jobs as these two polar opposite of characters. There's a bunch of subtleties in this film that do require you to have to see numerous times but that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.In my honest opinion I would have to say that this is my second favorite PTA film only behind the masterpiece that is There Will Be Blood, but it's not by much. It's going to take time for this film to be seen for what it is. It might take a few years for this film to start to get the respect that it deserves but I honestly believe it does deserve it."
387,The Master,8,30 December 2013,The master- a review of...life.,"I just finished ""the Master"" and it's filled with spectacular acting throughout. Joaquin Phoenix (Freddie Quell) is the best I have seen him as an actor and even his appearance is new to us. He's slimmed down and beaten up which really adds some authenticity to his character, a war weary alcoholic who has lost himself after he returns home from WWII. He is attempting to pick up the pieces in his life, and like many people he's asking a question of existence that may be impossible to answer. When he meets Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), a charismatic ""cult"" leader, who like all cult leaders seems to have all the answers. Freddie is open to suggestion and alone, he's sucked into a world of obedience and instruction. And although afraid of being disowned by his newly found family, fights to hold onto his individuality...even if it is a flawed one. What this movie stated to me is that if you want to believe it bad enough you will, and not knowing the answers to life is a disease we all suffer from if we're really honest. Freddie is a man full of pain and regret, he's immature at times and very mixed up but he is himself and that's enough. He must live life and enjoy the little things when he can. This is a story about most of us, lost, hurting and just trying to find a little happiness. This movie is also inspired by Scientology but if u think this stuff is bizarre and ridiculous then check out ""Going Clear"" cus it only scratches the surface believe me. Hey all u IMDb'ers out there, if I ever go missing it was Tom Cruise OK?"
388,The Master,,28 December 2013,An oddity but worth the effort,"Long, slow, and rather odd. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who gave us the wonderful ""There Will Be Blood"", this is his film first since that success five years ago and, while some critics raved about it, most viewers will find this heavy going. Anderson has highlighted that the primary influence for the film was John Huston's 1946 documentary ""Let There Be Light"" and admitted that L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Scientology served as partial basis for the character of ""The Master"" and his cult ""The Cause"". Students of film will note some cinematic novelties in Anderson's shooting, but the stand-out features of the film are two outstanding performances: Philip Seymour Hoffman in the eponymous role as the charismatic and manipulative leader Lancaster Dodd and Joaquin Phoenix as the mumbling, explosively angry and psychologically damaged war veteran Freddie Quell, the first intoxicated with words and ideas and the second too often drunk on homemade concoctions."
389,The Master,7,17 December 2013,Confusing but strong character study of the interaction between two damaged men,"I was 'fortunate' enough to see this in the only cinema in the Netherlands that can handle 70mm (EYE filmmuseum Amsterdam). Although.. it did break halfway through. They then switched to the 'regular' HD digital format and behold: I didn't notice a thing. So either it's me, or 70mm really is redundant in this day and age.The movie itself is a bit confusing, but the acting is brutally phenomenal! The story is interesting, yet slightly absent at times. It's probably best considered as a 'character study'. With very interesting characters, for sure! The Scientology-comparisons are overrated. It's about a Master of a Cult, with a 'belief/theory' as unclear as Scientology's. That's it. It's really more a movie about two powerful but damaged men, extremely well acted, very captivating and a bit.. well, confusing."
390,The Master,9,10 December 2013,"Good film, filled with excellent performances and critiques to religious movements","This film is a must watch and definitely one of the best of 2012,top ten. Complaints about character development are ridiculous, because all we need to know about the characters is told in a superb way.The two hours and so weren't enough, this film had so many curious cinematography aspects and a so beautiful jazz's based soundtrack that these couple of things alone may affect you for doing a re- watch.Joaquin Phoenix did a very good job as Freddie, the 'animal' man which Lancaster Dodd aka The Master, the leader of a cult followed religious movement, interpreted by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is obsessed to convert. Freddie follows his own orders though, he is free of any kind of control in this world, and in the end he don't looks as crazy as we thought. Lacanster ideas have plenty in common with the creator of the Scientology ,L. Ron Hubbard. In fact, this film already drew lots of comparisons and controversies because the critiques and similarities of the personal life of Hubbard with Lancaster's character.And in the end, the film shows that not only these 'Cult' movements are responsible for the alienation of people, but also that everyone in the world follows a master, except those persons who are considered crazy exactly because they don't follows a master, and therefore no orders and laws. May I ask if they are so crazy?It's for you to decide. I have my own answer.Watch this film. 9.2/10"
391,The Master,7,10 December 2013,You Are Growing Very Sleepy.  No I'm Not.,"It's a story of a disturbed veteran in the wake of World War II. The VA doesn't help. There was no PTSD at the time, just ""combat fatigue"", of which real men were ashamed and had to be slapped back into manliness by heroes like General Patton.Joaquin Phoenix, no longer a handsome youth but a balding and intense adult, gets caught up in this movement resembling Dianetics. It's led by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who seems to come up with one polished performance after another Anyone expecting a Lifetime Movie Network production about someone's mind coming under the control of a phony Svengali is going to be disappointed. Nor is there an operatic melodrama about someone wrestling with the bottle. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, it's a quirky movie for adults. Since nobody's head gets wrenched off and since each shot lasts longer than a picosecond, this could be part of the emerging ""slow cinema."" Some incidents are edited out, and some are extended beyond the expectable.Hoffman isn't a fake. He truly believes in ""the process"" and thinks he can help Phoenix. And, man, does Phoenix need it. Hoffman is perceptive and intuitive but he has his human moments in which he loses his temper and shouts the F bomb when someone challenges his belief that the agonies of the current human is trillions of years old. Hoffman isn't a scientist. He's a faith healer and a leader but not a puritanical one. He has an occasional shot of home-made booze, likes the ladies to dance around fully naked while he sings a sea shanty. He turns cranky when he has a headache and he owes quite a lot of money to a dowager.Phoenix is at first curious about the little organization. He chuckles a bit when Hoffman puts him through the process, which I won't describe but which isn't particularly exotic. It's not derived from any earthly religion, nobody takes drugs, and nobody contemplates suicide. This is 1950. But Phoenix has been so twisted by his war experience and some youthful misjudgments regarding a girl that although he does his best to embrace the philosophy, he can't quite get it right. He puts too much effort into it, pacing between a wooden wall and a windowpane, shouting to himself, even as Hoffman tells him repeatedly that ""the application is stopped."" The friendship, if that's what it is, maybe ""bond"" would be more suggestive of the reltionship's emotional content, doesn't survive. Phoenix leaves for a long time, becoming a merchant seaman before he tries to return. Hoffman's wife is jealous and suspicious. Hoffman himself gives Phoenix the chance to leave or to stay, but when he begins to sing in his amateur voice, ""I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China,"" a tune popular at the time, we get the picture. So does Phoenix.That miserably rendered tune I take to be an example of Paul Thomas Anderson's letting the viewer's mind do some of the work. Would it have been better if Hoffman had thrown him out, saying, ""I'd like you to stick around but my wife hates you and I have to choose her over you, and besides you're too disruptive""? I'm not sure I'd watch it again. Not for a while anyway. But I admire the hell out of it because of the way the writer/director and the actors trust the audience. It's nice to be trusted. It makes you feel as if you were in a canoe on a lagoon -- rocking, gently rocking."
392,The Master,9,20 November 2013,Amazing Performances excelled this Superb Film,"The Master is a one of a kind film by Director Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, There Will Be Blood). The film springs a rare scent of magic, brilliance and works and all forms. The story and plot are quite simple but the Master is more of an in-depth character study and if you watch it as one, you should enjoy it. Having read many negative reviews, complaints are saying that there was no message, nothing happens, the film is boring and too long, and there are no like-able characters. It makes me wonder if people really watched and paid attention to the film. None of those complaints are valid and true. Though I am not surprised at the lack of respect and hatred for the film, seeing as it is not for everyone and not everyone will understand it (at least not on the first viewing). While watching the Master, one must pay close attention of the little details as they end up being more clear as the film progresses. Powerful performances is what excels the Master. Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quells is great as the alcoholic sex-driven confused man abandoned at shore wondering his way and path of survival. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd is also brilliant in his role playing the enigmatic leader of a group known as The Cause. Amy Adams plays Peggy Dodd, the wife of Dodd. What people don't get is that Dodd is actually a good man and really believes in what he's saying but he is alone and in need of validation. His ideas and methods are questioned by everyone around him, the police are on his back, his wife has taken his philosophy and turned it from a benevolent act into the beginnings a fundamentalist aggressive church, all Dodd has is Freddie. While opposite, in Freddie, Dodd finds validation that his methods work, as well as a friend, pet and guinea-pig. There were also some brief scenes of nudity, one in particular which is key to the film, where Freddie is half sleep and he sees many dancing ladies nude (it is in his head- what he sees). Some felt this was unnecessary and was simply added for the sake of nudity but it fits in within the context and vision of Freddie.The Master contains many brilliant scenes, from the first few scenes where Freddie is at shore joking towards strangers, to his offbeat encounter with a customer while him taking his photograph, to his first encounter with Dodd, Dodd giving Freddie several interviewing questions about his past, to them being taken to prison, to Freddie bonding with the daughter of Dodd, etc. The pace of the films is quite strange, yet it does not feel as if it drags on. At 2 hours 18 minutes, it runs steadily. Although I felt the very ending was somewhat rushed and let viewers hanging. From point on where we see Freddie unexpectedly take off on Dodd's motorcycle, to him visiting his past girlfriend, then him recurring back to his routes. I felt they could have added another scene. The final scene, as we see Freddie back on shore playing in the sand, then the screen fades black and the end credits start playing. The Master is a must see for the performances alone as Phoenix and Hoffman gave one of the best performances last year. The cinematography is also very well done and realistic as the film takes place in 1950, making sure the clothing and set design are up to par and the color schemes match the setting.*After rewatching the Master a little over a week later (11/28), one gets more of the gist of the film as it feels more natural. I have noticed more things that I have not on my first viewing. Still, the Master is brilliantly made and opens the eyes of those whom are curious."
393,The Master,7,25 September 2013,"A good film, a superb cast","When he returns home from the war, Naval veteran Freddie (Joaquin Phoenix) struggles to cope with 'normal' life, turning to alcoholism. Feeling unsettled and uncertain about his future, he accidentally stumbles upon Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the enigmatic leader of a group known as The Cause.Paul Thomas Anderson is one of those filmmakers who makes interesting films. They're not always great films, but they're always interesting and worth a look. 'There Will Be Blood' is the big mainstream and critical success everyone raves about, and any follow-up would have tough shoes to fill. That follow-up was 'The Master', and it made a very credible effort to fill them.What stands out most about 'The Master' for me is the two central performances. I don't think I've ever seen Joaquin Phoenix act like this before  it is a powerful, emotionally-charged and often heartbreaking performance, and I'm yet to see him match up to it anywhere else. Hoffman is his usual excellent self as the cult leader. Dodd is an angry man hiding behind the façade of a self-confident man, and the actor is at his best when we start to see the cracks appear. There is no better example of the two men at their best than the prison scene. It is uncomfortable to sit through, for all the right reasons.But here's the problem  if Phoenix wasn't so excellent in his role, and if Hoffman wasn't so good (and a mention needs to go here to Amy Adams too for her strong performance), this film wouldn't be so good. While the concept of the film is a very good one, it just moved along at too slow a pace. It was fun seeing good actors act good, but I kept urging the film to make something happen. And it never always delivered.What has made previous Anderson films so good is their ability to build up a sense of dread  we're aware something awful is about to happen, but we're not quite sure when and how. 'The Master' has this too, but just not at the same level we've seen in films like 'Boogie Nights' and 'There Will Be Blood'. That left the ending a little anticlimactic for me; and, while the final sequence is emotional, it doesn't provide the catharsis I expected.Don't get me wrong, 'The Master' is a good film, but I really do think it is only as good as it is because it's anchored by two very talented actors. Had the cast been different, I think the film would be vastly different. And so would this review."
394,The Master,6,11 August 2013,"Interesting concept, boring subject","It's great when the content of a work is reflected in its form. In this case it results in a film that is as clueless as its main character. I was left clueless as well, especially about the question why the movie had to take a long 144 minutes when there was nothing to tell in the first place. Intriguing afterward but at times a bit boring to sit through.Although this was all I had to say, I'm forced to extend this review with some extra lines to make it ready for publishing. In fact that answers my previous question: if content doesn't have a certain length, some people cannot believe it is worthwhile. Maybe that justifies that even a message without content needs 144 minutes to come across."
395,The Master,7,8 August 2013,Unfulfilled potential,"This is not standard US fare! A psychological drama filmed in 65mm to give authenticity to the time in which it took place (late 1940s - early 1950s), draws the viewer immediately into the intimacy of the relationship between the two main protagonists - Joaquin Phoenix's Freddie Quell and Philip Seymour Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd.Joaquin Phoenix lost out to a deserved Oscar win - his performance was exceptional - as good, if not better than Johnny Cash in Walk the Line. Philip Seymour Hoffman role as Phoenix's protector, advocate and sometime plaything was also seamless. However, Amy Adams character was not fully explored, giving a necessary extra dimension to the relationship between Phoenix and Hoffman.Without spoilers, Dodd is the charismatic leader of The Cause,(not so loosely) based on the founder of Scientology, L Ron Hubbard. (Could there have been an Oscar snub there?) Quell, an alcoholic drifter suffering from PSTD meets him by chance and as the story progresses, the manipulation and co-dependence between the two intensifies.Unfortunately what could have been excellent was somewhat slow and drawn out. Added to this were some historical inaccuracies. It is not impossible, but unlikely that Quell would have undergone Rorschach tests, which were still in the experimental phase, post WWII. There is also a scene in which Quell is wearing a dark shirt and tie under his jacket, something unheard of at that time. (Did they make lounge shirts in dark colors then?) Yet, in spite of the pace and possible defects,this is a sad tale that makes compelling viewing, if for Phoenix's performance alone. Ever the method actor, he clearly loses weight as the movie progresses, adding credence to his tormented character."
396,The Master,,6 August 2013,50 generations from the tower of Babel,"Is Paul Thomas Anderson in need of a trip to Europe for his next movie venture. I believe PTAs talent and artistic integrity would profit from a more limited budget. ""The Master"" consumed ten times what ""Hard Eight"" did. In ""Hard Eight"" PTA was on to something. In ""The Master"" he lost momentum. In spite of a very eccentric and promising start, the next 100 minutes just passed by. To me it was obvious that the tale just zick-zacked through the events/scenes, harming continuity and deepening of character and emotions. And I believe I was part of the intended target group. ""If you figure a way to live without serving a master, any master, then let the rest of us know, will you? For you'd be the first person in the history of the world."" Welcome to Europe Paul Thomas Anderson."
397,The Master,8,20 July 2013,The Master simple review.,"Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman in the same film? Is this a dream-come-true? At first I thought ""This sounds so phenomenal..... Oh how i hope it isn't so good that it is bad."" The movie had such high expectations from everyone that it would be about Freddie Quell (Phoenix) who stumbles upon a cult or new religion which is lead by Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman) and Quell then slowly notices how Dodd's methods are not true and not correct then trying to take him down. This is not what happens, and i think this is the reason why the movie only has a 7.2 IMDb user's rating. Quell is a character within himself. Phoenix's performance could not have been replicated by anyone else (maybe by Hoffman if he really wanted to). Also Lancaster Dodd and his wife Peggy Dodd (Adams) have an unusual relationship. I was happy with this, i imagine if you were the wife of a cult leader your relationship wouldn't be the hopeless-romantic type. Coming into the movie I saw that the film isn't completely on the topic of Quell's journeys with The Cause (name of the cult), but the plot of the film is how Quell lives his life, and how he overcomes or drinks his way through the predicaments he is put in. The cinematography, camera angles, and screenplay writing are phenomenal. I don't think the cinematography could have been been better. Also this was a refreshment as i had thought that Joaquin Phoenix was done making movies and was to pursue his rapping career. This was a nice way to slap us in the face and say ""You really think i would rap when i am such a talented actor?"" Paul Thomas Anderson, I think could have done more. Better understanding of emotions from characters. Better story telling through acting rather than dialogue. The Master is a movie i recommend, just come into it expecting what you don't already expect."
398,The Master,7,19 July 2013,Actual facts about the movie.,"The Master1. The way the mirror cabinet opened in the bathroom just after the first scene with Hoffman and Phoenix show the little details that the director and actor pays attention to. It is opposite to the general norm of mirror cabinets in modern bathrooms. It makes me think about the manner the doors open in modern cars as compared to older ones, except Roll's Royce card. 2. The perpetual bent feature of the character Quell portraits the lack of backbone in his character. He is lonely, horny, frustrated, delusional and above all the self destructive nature of Quell. 3. It has been a long time I have seen actors being nominated for the Oscars. This is my take, nominations are more legit than the final winners. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant in his pot-rail of Freddie Quell, as a loss for a better word a ""F***ed U*"", human being. 4. One more highlight of the movie is Lancaster Dodd ( Hoffman)'s character. He understood the idea of non judge mental idea about Quell. He, in a harsh but truthful manner, depicts a scientific perspective on Quell. This is a hats off to the director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson to accentuate the scientific temper's more importance to human emotions. This is also exemplified by the discussion about time travel in the party by Dodd. 5. The relation between Dodd and Quell is like a priest and a confession Er respectively. 6. Lab rat is what Didd thinks about Quell."
399,The Master,6,17 June 2013,Notable moments held together by long stretches of worn thread,"Joaquin Phoenix acted the hell out of his role - there were moments where I had to question if it was actually him on the screen. Hoffman as expected delivers an exalted performance. These two hold your attention from beginning to end.The story, though great in many single places, feels more like an expansive suburban area connected by a series of overly long barren highways. There is excitement once one arrives in a place, but the ""getting there"" process is quite a struggle.There was a bit too much story-telling indulgence. I'm sure that the film makers felt that ever minute of the movie helps tell the story, it was very difficult as a viewer to share that sentiment."
400,The Master,7,28 April 2013,Sick Characters in Search of an Auteur,"I'm still not sure what to make of this latest installment in P.T. Anderson's cinematic history of weird America. Judging by the dueling trailers and deleted scenes on the Blu-ray disc, PTA felt compelled to sacrifice some gorgeous shots (two overeager sailors in liberty whites diving off the fantail of a carrier) and useful plot material to his gnarly auteurist vision. The focus is almost exclusively on his two protagonists, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman זיכרו לברכה), the founder of a scifi-inflected therapy cult known as the Cause, and Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a shellshocked vet (the year is 1950) with a taste for Navy-style jungle juice. Freddie stows away aboard a yacht borrowed from one of Dodd's wealthy patrons; their first meeting""informal processing,"" as Dodd calls itis the strongest scene in the film. Freddie becomes Dodd's bootlegger, confidant and enforcerDodd responds to a critic with a sputtered obscenity, Freddie tracks the man down and gets all Scientological on his ass (it reminded me of the relationship between Walter Pidgeon's smarmy Dr. Morbius and the invisible ""monster from the id"" in ""Forbidden Planet""). Up until about the halfway mark, ""The Master"" is a powerful, visually beautiful and totally involving film; after that, the auteurist vision thing starts to get in the way. The lengthy, real-time-and-then-some scenes of Freddie's ""therapy"" are fatal to the film's momentum. A later sequence involving a manuscript buried in the desert didn't make much sense without the deleted footage, and even with it, it's confusingFreddie is tested, found wanting, but still restored to favor by the capricious Dodd. Dramatizing Freddie's struggle with Dodd by shuffling Freddie's dreams and fantasies into the mix (I thinkhow else could he get a phonecall from Dodd while he's dozing in a movie theater?) only heightens the confusion. (And what's up with ""Slow Boat to China""?) Great soundtrack; strong performances by everyone (including a sweetly malevolent Amy Adams as Dodd's wife); Philip Seymour Hoffman may lack the requisite air of menace, but maybe that's why he needs a monster from the id as backup. Seriously flawed but still worth seeing. It's been turning up a lot on cable lately, but I'd hold out for the Blu-rayfor one thing, the deleted scenes seem essential to an understanding of the plot, or what's left of it, in the second half of the film."
401,The Master,7,9 April 2013,"It's themes may not resonate the same way for all, but there's still great wonderment in watching Paul's complex audio-visual experience with a brilliant cast","Lancaster Dodd, who is addressed as 'The Master' by the followers of 'The Cause', a philosophical sect led by him does not know the ultimate secret to all world problems himself. He does seem to have a vague idea about it, but his understanding seems garbled and vacillating; in one scene, he erupts at one of his followers for questioning a change he makes in his newly published book. He seems to get closer and closer to his answers while 'curing' Freddie Quell, a World War II veteran who is sex obsessed and suffers from alcoholism and aggression. Freddie almost seems like Dodd's alter ego who seems to display the feelings that Dodd restrains from, so while Dodd scolds Freddie whenever he displaces his anger towards those who criticize Dodd's beliefs, I do think a part of him wants to do exactly that but cannot for the obvious reason that it would tarnish his reputation. So when Dodd says to his family in one scene that it is The Cause that needs Freddie more than Freddie needing The Cause, he implicitly means that it is he himself who needs Freddie.Paul Thomas Anderson, the director and writer of 2012s multiple Oscar nominated 'The Master' does not know about Dodd The Master's ultimate goal either. So there's not a single moment in the movie where the Master reveals his ultimate purpose of curing Freddie; instead what Anderson tries to create is this little world of 'The Cause' which gains momentum right after the Second World War, and tries to create another form of escapism/diversion (whichever seems more suitable) from the real world. For Dodd, to get a person like Freddie is like jackpot because he's a man who's just escaped war and does not have a proper ground for himself  to push him back to reality all of a sudden is traumatic for a guy like him. So he's the right person who truly needs The Cause's help, not those people who believe the Cause can do miracles like curing leukemia by recalling past lives. As Dodd proceeds to help Freddie, there is a sense of disillusionment in Dodd and his belief that he can cure everything. I felt Anderson was trying to convey this in his film, but themes and symbolisms don't connect with us easily as they did in his earlier film 'Magnolia' or the brilliant Jason Reitman movie 'Up in the Air'. You'll have to break your head to find these meanings, and so the reaction given by late critic Roger Ebert ""But what is the film trying to communicate?"" is expected and justified.I personally think that this film will be easier to grasp by those who've been a part of some religious or philosophical group/cult in their lives. I had a short stint with an organization myself, and I can say that Paul clearly has done his research about the way such organizations work or the things that people experience there. People who want to wash off their past deeds or are haunted by some past memory usually are easily enamored when they find a temporary relief to their pains; Freddie's grief of leaving his love Doris for war is placated during his first session with Dodd. Such people soon find themselves closely associated with the leader and during the period learning about the leader's own vulnerabilities; Freddie defends Dodd against anyone who's critical about him, including beating up a skeptic, fighting the police who come to arrest Dodd, and later assaulting Dodd's publisher. And one fine day, they are ready to leave because they've got what they wanted and need no more.Paul also casts a wonderful ensemble who builds up complex characters: Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Dodd, a highly ambitious man with noble intentions, in a way that evokes empathy towards his vision despite not believing some of the 'curing methods' that he practices. Joaquin Phoenix gives Freddie a complex characterization, which includes narrow eyes, a hunched back and a bony appearance. When he's dirty, he's as dirty as one can get, when he's angry, he's a raging animal you'd want to stay away from and when he's vulnerable, he tears at your heart. Amy Adams plays Peggy, Dodd's strong, supportive and pregnant wife the way you'd expect Amy Adams to play her, but yes her face conveys a lot in some of the scenes, like the one where her character looks concernedly at a drunken Freddie from the corner as others are singing and dancing.But the best thing about The Master is the brilliantly complex audio visual orchestra created by Paul: he's such an expert at blending on screen, off-screen sounds and background score with image, flashbacks, dreams that this movie is a must-see for all filmmakers and enthusiasts. Even with the sheer beauty of the image, the colors and the sounds, its themes may not resonate the same way for everyone, so it's either 'You follow them or you don't'."
402,The Master,7,13 March 2013,Half-Realized and Excessive,"Superb Acting and Cinematography this Movie Exudes Excellence but is a Half-Realized effort that is Intriguing but, at times, Ineffectual. There are some very Interesting Set-Ups that draw You in, but go nowhere. Phoenix gives a Strong Performance of a very Troubled Character. Some Scenes are so obviously Intended to be Provocative (masturbation and raw, unattractive nudity) but do nothing more than Alienate and for the most part are Nonsensical. The Film, when it is a Deep Introspection of Character and Charisma, Cults and the cultish, can be insightful. Seymour Hoffman is Masterful and could have used more Screen Time where, perhaps, Phoenix Less.But it is the excessive Pretensions that mostly fail the Films long Length (mostly with Freddy Quell). The Beauty that arises Occasionally is frequently Undercut by unbridled Ugliness. The Intellectualizing and the Psychology of Cult are its Strong Suits.This is Movie-Making where the Director pushes the Boundaries for experimental Excess and that Overwhelms, as the Film's real Strength is the exploration of Human Behavior and Social Norms."
403,The Master,8,12 March 2013,Nothing If Not Different,"Tip: If you're still digging THE MASTER after the first 30-40 minutes, continuing to the end will probably be worth it; otherwise, it probably won't be.THE MASTER is another idea-driven experiential film. It's one to analyze and does not work terribly well as straight entertainment, so I can understand many people's reasons for disliking it. As my rating indicates, I like it a good bit even though I wish it had a more cohesive plot. This film combines a 1950s style, mood, setting, and soundtrack with expertly modern cinemagraphic techniques to very interesting effect. While it does not just try to be weird for weirdness's sake, I can only say that I have never seen anything remotely like it.Joaquin Phoenix gives a memorable performance as ""aberrated"" WWII veteran Freddie Quell, a unique if not particularly endearing character. The entire film centers around Quell's codependent relationship with Lancaster Dodd, the founder of the embryonic L. Ron Hubbardish ""Cause."" Although they are two very different people, the way the two men connect in their mutual fantasy is both fascinating and believable.THE MASTER could be interpreted many different ways. It has satirical value in places, but its primary focus seems to something about different individuals' search for meaning and happiness in this life. (Is it REALLY just all about getting laid?) This film's detractors often accuse it of being an exercise in sophomoric pornography disguised as ""Art."" Yet, while sex-in-general is undeniably an important topic in THE MASTER, on the contrary, there are only two relatively brief scenes of coitus/female nudity here."
404,The Master,5,10 March 2013,Good and ick at the same time.,"The artsy fartsy community will LOVE this film, the other billions of people in the world will either fall asleep, stop watching or scratch their heads during the ending credits while asking ""what the hell."" First: Amazing acting! Some of the best done by any of the performers in this show. Second: Incredible dialogue (Lots of it and then lots more of it and then, in case you missed any of that LOTS more of it)! Third: Phenomenally soul-bearing Fourth: Absolutely boring, anti-climatic, draining and SNORE. It's proof that writing can be both very good and absolutely mind-numbing at the same time. It's a story that demonstrates that absolutely no change by any of the characters takes place. In other words, the story goes absolutely nowhere and focuses entirely too much on the wrong character when it should be focusing more on Phillips Seymour Hoffman's. If you like the type of movie where you leave the theater going ""meh, but what great acting,"" then this might be the movie for you, but I rented this on Redbox for a buck and a half and I felt I paid too much. And I do love artsy fartsy movies. In fact, I teach literature and critical approaches to literature and even film studies on the university level,if that tells you how boring I am. Even with as boring as I am in movies, this movie made even me go ""end already."" A s much as I love the acting, the body as a whole (not including the actors) is just really sub par. I don't know how all these reviewers are raving about this director because he's really the only director I can think of who can consistently suck the life out of an audience (other than M. Night Shyamalan)."
405,The Master,5,9 March 2013,Indulgent and Pointless,"A war veteran becomes involved with a cult group and its charismatic leader. There's a scene where Adams say, ""This is pointless."" That could be said of the film. Once the Scientology-like cult is established, the film has nowhere to go and gets bogged down in repetitive sessions where Hoffman tries to cure people of their ailments. When it comes to making long and pointless films, the annoyingly self-indulgent Anderson is the master. As the disturbed war veteran, Phoenix is all mannerisms. He walks with a hunch and delivers his lines from one side of his mouth with clenched teeth, making subtitles a necessity. Hoffman is terrific in the title role, managing to deliver ridiculous lines without looking ridiculous."
406,The Master,6,6 March 2013,Not the most entertaining flick...It's a acting movie but with a good enough script,"This is a slow moving movie with a non clear cut narrative and when it comes down to it. It's basically a acting movie with drama and a good enough story to bring out the two main actors skill in their profession. The story is basically about the bond between a Vietnam vet that is going through some trauma and is going towards a self-destructive road and is played by Joaquin Phoenix. And a wacko cult leader activist that has no rationality and has only self-incentives. Which is basically almost all cult leaders is played by Seymour Hoffman. And these two actors did a superb job. Joaquin Phoenix on sort of reminded me of his role in ""Walk the Line"" and Seymour Hoffman slightly reminded me of Matt Damon in ""The Informant!"". And the script has enough dramatic substance and good enough dialogues for them to bring out their A game. It isn't the most entertaining movie I seen nor is it thrilling, in fact some parts seemed to be a bit drawn out. But it does have substance and has a script where the actors actually have something to work with.6/10"
407,The Master,5,4 March 2013,Great therapy for insomniacs,"The movie has fantastic acting from start to finish. Of that there is no denying. But the story couldn't be less interesting. And the movie couldn't get any slower. In between naps, I prayed for some kind of resolution or direction. Alas no. The movie just displayed scenes of dim people being manipulating into being part of a group of which their beliefs and motives were never truly defined. I think the followers were as confused as the people watching the film. What I can say is that if you are having trouble sleeping, this movie will surely cure you. With some heavy editing and perhaps some screen writing that arrives at some objective or destination would have really made this an enjoyable film."
408,The Master,7,28 February 2013,acting so brilliant it's rarely seen,"Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, ""The Master"" is the story of the relationship between two men, the leader of a faith-based group and a damaged World War II veteran.Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) returns from Navy service stricken with PTSD and in the habit of making drinks with items like paint thinner. He can't hold down a job due to his erratic behavior. One day, while he's working on a cabbage farm, one of his drinks poisons an elderly man, and Freddie goes on the run. One night he, while drunk, he boards a yacht owned by Lancaster Dodd, the leader of something called The Cause.Dodd allows Freddie to stay on the yacht and involves him in his organization, which promises to help process past trauma and deal with emotions. Freddie becomes deeply involved with both Dodd and The Cause.This is purportedly the story of L. Ron Hubbard, and perhaps it is based on his story. Having been around in the '70s, none of what Dodd preaches sounds strange to me, nor will it to anyone who lived in the era of EST, Silva Mind Control, TM, or past life regression.The point of this film seems to have been the examination of the relationship between Dodd and Quell, and that dominates the film. The acting is absolutely superb, with Joaquin Phoenix turning in a remarkable performance as Freddie. He seamlessly becomes the character. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as the charismatic Dodd, and Amy Adams does an excellent job as his tough, committed wife.I can't say I thought this was a great movie as it really didn't seem to go anywhere. What makes the film well worth it is Joaquin Phoenix's transcendent performance, as well as the work of Hoffman and Adams."
409,The Master,4,28 February 2013,Tough Movie to Like,"I could have liked this movie. The premise was promising. The acting was terrific (especially Phoenix, whom I said to my wife at the beginning, ""I really don't like Juaquim Phoenix""). The sad fact is, this movie is about nothing. It goes nowhere and there is no real story. My wife and I wanted desperately to shut it off 80% of the way through this lethargic show. I gave it a ""4"" for the acting. The screenplay is terrible. This is all I wanted to say about this but IMDb insists I write ten lines. I am not sure I know the value of that. Anyway, I enjoyed ""There will be Blood"", which is also long and slow, but I understood the sad story of a evil and driven man. Phoenix sort of reminded me of a Billie Bob Thornton character (he could have been cast equally well), but this was surely a great opportunity for Phoenix to show the world he is an acting talent."
410,The Master,,27 February 2013,A film to be enjoyed more for the excellent performances than for the actual story.,"I saw this on a DVD rental from Redbox, really knowing nothing about it other then it had received considerable Oscar notice. I must admit I was totally taken in by this film, and especially the acting of Phoenix and Hoffman. Especially Phoenix, who apparently lost weight for the role and adopted a somewhat skewed stance and gait befitting of an alcoholic always on the verge of self-destruction.But the actual story is very unclear. It seems to be about the post-war soldier (Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell ) having a difficult time in the late 1940s and early 1950s adjusting to civilian life. But most or all of his difficulty arose from his very flawed personality, and his habit of drinking concoctions that included such unusual ingredients as gasoline, paint thinner, and Lysol. That's enough to destroy anyone's mind.In his wanderings Quell happens upon the boat of a new-age spiritualist (Philip Seymour Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd ) originating ""the cause"" who many say is modeled after the creator of Scientology, not so coincidentally in the same year, 1950. They develop a strange bond, and Dodd uses what he calls ""processing"" to try to rid Quell of the problems of his life. But it never really ""takes"", Quell just learns to play along to stay in what has become a relatively safe existence.It reminds me of the 1971 movie ""A Clockwork Orange"" where the young man, a petty thief an sex addict, was treated to reform him. It never really worked, he pretended it did as a way to be let loose and return to his former life.To me the acting is really the best (perhaps only) reason to see ""The Master."" Phoenix is a proved actor and he creates a very memorable Quell. And Hoffman is one of the best, as he proves every movie he does, and here is no exception as Dodd. Plus Amy Adams as Dodd's wife. But as far as the story goes, it does not add up to much, just several really good character studies."
411,The Master,,25 February 2013,The most fascinating disappointment in recent memory,"""They start the same and they end the same"", said brilliant director Paul Thomas Anderson about the characters of THE MASTER in a recent brief interview with Charlie Rose. ""We're all children of Stanley Kubrick, aren't we? Is there anything you can do that he hasn't done?""  that's another quote from PT Anderson. THE MASTER did remind me of Kubrick a lot; it basically follows the same path of a film like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971), with a protagonist, a war veteran with an obsession for alcohol and sex, going through a series of attempts by different people to help him, ""cure"" him and put him back into society, only to end pretty much where he started. THE MASTER also shares things with Anderson's previous effort THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007)  both are character studies of long duration, meant to be seen by patient viewers and to be thought long after the closing credits appeared. It's basically the most fascinating disappointment of 2012  a weird case, with the best performance of the year (Joaquin Phoenix as the mentioned war veteran Freddie Quell  one thing's for sure: you will never forget the Freddie Quell name), one of the most brilliant sequences with the use of the flashback, and a terrific score (and vintage songs like ""Get Thee Behind Me Satan"" by Ella Fitzgerald), but still not as mind blowing as I hoped. Needless to say, for my money it's nowhere near the best work of PT Anderson. As the so-called ""Scientology film"", it's quite interesting  it sure offers a great view at the power of a preacher, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Lancaster Dodd) will intrigue you, echoing the f***** up thinking of L. Ron Hubbard (for more you have to check out the brilliant SOUTH PARK episode ""Trapped in the Closet""). THE MASTER is a strange one but at the same time not at all. In fact, I would have preferred that my disappointment had more to do with the word ""strangeness""; THERE WILL BE BLOOD, for instance, left me intrigued and thinking a whole lot while this one didn't. In other words, I don't think I didn't ""get"" something about it. The strangest thing is definitely how Freddie cross paths with ""the master"" Lancaster Dodd and ""the Cause"" (this is how the Scientology-like cult of Dodd is called)  during a lonely and cold night, Freddie decides to break into a yacht (Dodd's one) and he's allowed to stay there because he can prepare unique alcoholic beverages. Sounds sort-of weird, right? But trust me, this whole thing is the best stuff of the film. This guy Freddie ain't your typical alcoholic  this is a guy who drinks fuel, photographic chemicals, thinner, etc. He has a gift to mix deadly stuff like these liquids and create irresistible drinks. My favorite sequence of the film begins with Freddie and Lancaster drinking a glass, well less than half of the glass for obvious reasons, of a yellow beverage that Freddie created with whiskey, thinner and stuff. The sequence lasts for 20 or so minutes and ends with both characters drinking their second glass of the (practically) poisonous beverage. What's great is that during those 20 or so minutes we get to know Freddie's past, something that up until that point wasn't yet very clear, as well as the core of the proceedings that the Cause uses. Scientology, or well ""the Cause"" is interested and believes in so-called ""past lives"". We're interested in Freddie's past  we know that he came home from war and then went under some proceedings and met with doctors who tried to unravel his past and thoughts without many success. Master Lancaster, on the other hand, achieves what the doctors couldn't and in consequence we get to hear more about Freddie's family and see flashbacks with the thing that truly bothers him. Like I said, it's a fine, brilliant sequence and sets for an engaging issue with a war veteran finally finding some peace through a group like the Cause. Unfortunately, after that the film never has again a really powerful part, and coincidentally we never see Freddie playing with his beverages again. It felt a bit fragmented and couldn't achieve a huge overall impact. There's another long sequence with Freddie going under the proceedings of the Cause but nowhere as engaging, hell it's even boring (but still I have to say it works as an exposure of the craziness behind the cult). Good news is that PT Anderson won't take another 6 years to release a film and INHERENT VICE is coming in 2014 according to some reports. I couldn't be happier with the fact that Joaquin Phoenix is starring it, as I truly wanted to love THE MASTER as a whole as I loved his performance  in other words, I like to believe this ain't the definitive collaboration between these brilliant masters. *Watched it on 21 & 23 February, 2013"
412,The Master,7,19 February 2013,Completely unnecessary,"With this, his sixth film, Paul Thomas Anderson enters the hallowed halls of master craftsmen like David Fincher or Steven Spielberg, by creating a film that is very well made yet completely devoid of meaning, honest emotion or inspiration. It all starts with the end of Joaquin Phoenix service in the navy during World War II, accompanied by a Johnny Greenwood score so painful to hear it could be taken straight from There Will Be Blood. Luckily, Anderson learned from that film and the music becomes bearable before a debilitating headache makes it impossible to follow the storyline further. Phoenix leaves the service insane, probably even more so than before he entered it, and drifts around America looking to piece together a life, unsuccessfully, until he comes across Philip Seymour Hoffman's cult that appears to be modeled on Scientology. What follows is a rather by-the-numbers story about their interaction. Yes, there is plenty here to like. The acting of Phoenix is excellent, while Hoffman partly disappoints, never coming across as charismatic enough to draw so many people to his crazy religion. And Anderson is a very good director. But there is very little reason to watch this film. It really lacks inspiration. It's solid, but there is nothing out of the ordinary here. Anderson's latest, There Will Be Blood, tried for something far greater and while I personally regard it as a failure, at least it was ambitious and daring. This one you can take or leave, it won't make any difference. Just as it wouldn't have made any difference if it had never been made."
413,The Master,7,19 February 2013,Powerhouse performances in a mediocre film.,"First of all I decided to watch this film as part of the 2013 best actor/supporting actor category and well I got what I came for. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is breathtaking,and probably his best yet.From the moment I was introduced to his character I was blown away at how he had immersed himself completely in the deranged vessel of Freddie Quell. Philip Seymour Hoffman once again gives an Oscar worthy performance as ''The Master'',the leader of a mysterious globe trotting cult,who takes Freddie under his wing.The film as a whole though is weak at the hinges,a two and a half hour film that many will feel could have been cut down to two hours. The overall theme is understandably bleak and depressing but one would feel that the odd light hearted moment would not have gone amiss.My final verdict is: If you are a fan of powerful acting or have a passing interest in the profession,then you will be enthralled by the two main performers in this picture.If you are the average movie goer then this is probably one to avoid.Thanks for reading."
414,The Master,6,7 February 2013,Typical artistic movie acclaimed by critics,"Some specific features: hectic plot with recurrent ideas; great acting performances; protracted length; narrow(-minded) and dull background. In my opinion, The Master meets all the criteria above. For a so-called common viewer, only acting is left to enjoy, the rest is uninteresting and the time of over 2 hours feels like eternity. The ending is also sudden and loose. There are not too many who go to the cinema primarily because of skillful camera angles, reasonings on ""higher"" topics, sharing brainwash feelings etc. Male characters are much stronger than females (I must admit that Amy Adams' Oscar nomination is rather odd to me); Philip Seymour Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd and Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell are great to follow - as usual. Yes, they saved the movie, but I satisfy myself through other and great movies with their participation.I am certain that, for most of ""ordinary"" viewers, The Master is an one-time experience - most do it before the Academy Award ceremony and after potential winnings."
415,The Master,7,5 February 2013,"Meet The Geniuses: Hoffman, Phoenix & Anderson!","So, the story is very rare and totally confusing if you don't know anything about post-war trauma. Well, even I don't know much about it but, yes The Master is epic.Now, what I loved about The Master is its direction. Absolutely stunning camera work here complemented by sheer music. The classic of the movie will outlive. Joaquin is terrific, so is Hoffman with their expressions, dialogs and posture - my God, i be damned. Adams was good, too!The Master is a very appealing movie but seems very draggy at times. But, if you are a drama-lover and want to know how the lives of two different people post-war is, watch it! 100% recommended!WATCH OUT FOR: Joaquin & Hoffman, the processing scene and conversations!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

416,The Master,6,30 January 2013,My favorite director over-stretching a great story.,"I am a huge fan of Anderson. Having said that, i have to admit that for the first time i felt the urge to leave the cinema before the film ended. Why? I was bored.The actors are - again - on top of their energy. Like always in a Anderson's movie. The music was weird but it worked - echo's of Punch Drunk Love. The biggest achievement of this movie is the production-design and foremost: how it was captured by camera. Colours, objects and moving people.... they give an uneasy, restless, not-really-in-balance atmosphere, that i can easily feel as a metaphor of the main-character. To me, a brilliant statement of this character's unbalanced quality, that makes him such dangerous tool in handling the heavy and soul-touching techniques he developed.But.... the script is not developed properly. It starts promising but in the middle it looses itself in a boring confirmation of the relationship between the two main characters. Nothing important happens. It makes the end not work like it could have. The long shots of the two men, looking at each other, don't say anything to me, where they could have been of a dangerous, doom-predicting quality that suits the man we know and what came of his 'cause'."
417,The Master,7,29 January 2013,I really wanted to like this film a lot more.,"I really wanted to like this film a lot more.With incredible performances from all of the cast. It's hard not to call this film a completely character driven film. With Joaquin Phoenix role as the War veteran completely commanding and a serious well driven performance that should be commanded. Also Philip Seymour Hoffman role as the cult leader Lancaster Dodd is also an incredible performance that makes us believe that he is able to persuade people that the ""Cause"" is something to invest into.Although the problem with The Master is that it is boring. Just boring, boring and more boring. There isn't a story that need's to be told at all. It is just pointless. The problem with the story is that while it is a demanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix you don't invest in his character. At all. Throughout the film you ask yourself why we are seeing this story from his point of view. It could be interesting but someone who is nut's all the way through the story dose not make you feel anything once leaving the theatre. He was nut's when we first saw him and when we leave him he is more nut's. Although the plot let down is quite decisive. From a technical standpoint the film shines. With the cinematography being truly superb. This is film that is incredible to look at. One of the most notable examples of this is during the first ten or so minutes when we are first introduced to Freddie. It is during the war and presumably he is at a beach somewhere in Asia and it just shines. It look's incredible truly incredible. Look's like the world's best holiday destination. The film set in 1950's America boost some truly incredible set design and also costumes which really add to the authenticity of it.All in all. The Master is incredible from a technical standpoint. But is let down by the plot. In which nothing happens."
418,The Master,8,6 January 2013,"The Story of America, Part III","My wife and I saw this last night, at our local 'art' cinema. I mention this because The Master is very much an Art movie. It dispenses with the basics of plot and instead chooses to focus on its characters. The other essential of story-telling (that the central characters must be somehow changed by their experiences) is also somehow missing. Chief characters Freddie Quell and Lancaster Dodd don't appear to be significantly altered by their relationship by the movie's end. Quell just seems to be more haggard and time-worn. Dodd merely to have lost patience with his one-time protégé. So what enjoyment and or insight is there to gain from The Master? The enjoyment lies primarily with the level of professional abilities on display and its obvious creative achievements: the direction, the script, the performances, the music and the intriguing story of the origins of Scientology. However, despite all this obvious talent, the story itself feels incomplete and frustratingly open-ended, typical of so many 'art' films (see above). And yet, despite this failing, there is still an embarrassment of riches on display for the film enthusiast.Phillip Seymour Hoffman is, of course, a highly accomplished and unfailingly magnetic performer. Every movie he appears in is enhanced immeasurably by his presence. And his portrayal of Lancaster Dodd holds many delights. Dodd's charisma is plain to see and he is a master salesman, as befits a man who sits at the head of a (soon to be global) personality cult. Hoffman succeeds in conveying all of these qualities with ease, along with Dodd's explosive temper. This is the artist at the height of his powers. Playing the foil to Dodd's straight man is the mercurial and mysterious Freddie Quell. Quell's character is a riddle, wrapped in an enigma, shrouded in mystery (to borrow from Winston Churchill). His motivations seem to be extremely simple - get drunk and laid as often as possible. He seems to live in the moment and for the moment. In other words while Dodd is driven entirely by his intellect, Quell is purely instinctive. This dichotomy is the chief driving force behind the picture, as Dodd tries again and again to whip Freddie into shape and drive the 'animal' out of him. In the end he fails and Freddie goes back to his evil ways, no doubt to succumb to an early death as a result of his depredations. (Dodd's future achievements are, of course, a matter of record.)Joaquin Phoenix does a masterful job of delivering Freddie to the audience, and its a mammoth undertaking. He is on the screen in almost every scene and truly plumbs the depths of his soul to create a mesmerising character out of very little. There is very little back story, no explanations, just a man fresh out of the war, suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder who appears incapable of integrating into normal society. Freddie never attempts to explain himself, he appears incapable of rationalising or justifying his own behaviour. He just IS. Phoenix has been criticized for 'over-doing' it with tics and other mannerisms but I didn't see it. To my mind his performance was quite restrained and largely internal. Suffice to say it is a magnificent effort, and I am sure most serious actors, on viewing it, must have felt quite despondent and desperate, wondering how in hell they will ever match it. The insight provided by the movie is another matter entirely. I think it is essential to view it alongside two previous PTA efforts, Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood. To my mind these these stories are all very similar. They appear to be about the origins of the American persona and way of life. All three are uniquely American stories: the origins of the porn industry, the oil industry, and the quasi-psychiatric self-help industry. The characters of Dirk Diggler, Lancaster Dodd and Daniel Plainview, too, are uniquely American. Self-made, larger than life, fiendishly charismatic, fiercely ambitious. Is this how the American psyche was shaped, PTA appears to be asking. Three uniquely American stories. Each in its own way, providing powerful insights into the American way of life, the origins of the American Dream, if you will. No doubt, some will disagree, but to my mind, it seems quite obvious. On its own, The Master is undoubtedly a phenomenal achievement in film- making, no matter how you slice it. However, when viewed as part of a triptych, along with the above-mentioned two films, it takes on a whole new significance."
419,The Master,6,30 November 2012,Oscar-baiting performances in a film that is perplexing.,"I've really struggled to write a review for The Master. I know it's a fine film. It looks superb, the performances are for the most part excellent, some of the cinematography is just wonderful to behold and it has 'Oscar' written all over it.The issue here is that my fellow cinephile for the evening and I emerged from Screen 1 of The Watershed, made vaguely encouraging noises and then admitted to each other, almost in unison, ""I think I enjoyed it, but I don't really know what it was about..."" Alcoholic WWII veteran, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) stumbles through numerous jobs that invariably end with him humiliating himself and being sacked. One drunken night, he climbs aboard the yacht of Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the charismatic, almost god-like figurehead of The Cause, a cult dressed up as a philosophical movement. Rather than hurl him into the sea, Dodd takes Quell under his wing, regarding him as the ultimate challenge that will prove the invincibility of The Cause and himself.What follows is a patchwork of scenes detailing the 'therapy' of Quell, the egotism of Dodd, a man who regards himself as a virtual deity, and the relationship of his wife, Peggy (Amy Adams), with both men. On the periphery are the fawning acolytes, the family and staff, the naysayers and the world that doesn't understand Dodd's work, or maybe does understand it but regards him as a jumped up twerp.Perhaps director Paul Thomas Anderson delights in the confusion The Master creates. He did, after all, divide audiences massively with his much lauded and equally wildly ridiculed Magnolia, though The Master is perhaps closer in tone to the more accessible, multi-award winning There Will Be Blood. I'm quite sure he couldn't give a damn what I think but surely if his audience departs not with strong views but with mild bafflement, something is awry.It is difficult to decide which out of Hoffman and Phoenix is the star, though that's an issue for Harvey Weinstein come awards season, but both are equally commanding in their performances. Hoffman's Dodd variously encourages, embraces and terrorizes his subject and his family but when it comes to his critics, he is damning and unforgiving. That he believes passionately in what he preaches is not in doubt and Hoffman never wavers from his road as Dodd, even when the master slips away from his own life path.Phoenix is on the form we have come to expect after stellar performances in Walk the Line and Gladiator. We pity his Quell, laugh both with and at him and come dangerously close to writing him off as a failure, but he is always watchable and the intensity with which Phoenix ensures we understand his demons is at times uncomfortable.The casting of Adams could have been awkward. Her name conjures images of twee girlfriend characters in the likes of The Muppets and Enchanted and it's easy to forget she has shone in more serious fare like The Fighter. As with that film, Adams is very much the support to a pair of showier performances but The Master would be a far poorer film without her. She brings balance and sincerity to what could otherwise be just a film of two extremes.The Master may leave you slightly bewildered and even a little dissatisfied but there are moments of genuine, subtle humour and some beautifully stylized shots, not least of all when Quell rides a motorbike into the horizon leaving Mr. & Mrs. Dodd alone and perplexed. Well, that makes four of us.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"
420,The Master,6,25 November 2012,"There's a very fine line between terrible filmmaking and masterful filmmaking, and this film rides it.","Paul Thomas Anderson has made quite a few offbeat critical darlings that succeeded because of their performances, visual look and dialogue, but also because of their unwillingness to stick to formula. ""Magnolia"" features a twist that no one could see coming, and some would consider it an unexplained ""deus ex machina"", others saw it is extremely original. Anderson's other films, like ""Punch Drunk Love"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" have endings that don't conform to the typical Hollywood style, and some dislike how unresolved, or under resolved some elements of his films are. But ""The Master"" is it's own beast in Anderson's filmography. Here's a film that has to be interpreted by the viewer, because the film does not interpret itself. If the audience member is not actively creating thematic arches in their head, this film will feel utterly pointless.Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is an impulsively violent WWII veteran that will find anyway to get drunk. After drunkenly coming onboard a boat one night, Freddie meets Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a man who has started a new religious movement called ""The Cause"". Freddie, who's life prior to this, had been meaningless, now has someone to follow, but what are Dodd's motives, and is Freddie actually buying into what is being said? A lot of movies people can say ""Oh, pay attention!"", so that people don't miss any important plot points. This film has such a loosely formed plot, that paying very close attention to everything that is happening won't really matter. What's most important, it seems, is the thematic content. As an active viewer, you have to piece together the meaning of the film from what has been shown, and how the characters act. Paul Thomas Anderson has put the meaning completely in the spectator's hands, and as a result, made a film that will resonate differently among different people. Those watching intently, may have found some kind of wonderful meaning in the film, or maybe they found it to be lazily written and underdeveloped. I personally didn't care about the characters. Freddie is insane, and his insanity starts off interestingly enough, but ends up kind of baffling. Same with Lancaster Dodd. The guy is nuts. Both of these characters make decisions that have you questioning why they did what they did. Freddie will randomly start attacking someone...but why? Is it because he is hugely attracted to ""The Cause""? Is he just a violent sociopath? Does he even have a reason? With this film, it's like you're a complete outsider to everything. The characters aren't relatable, and their actions are never rationalized, and their inner thoughts never stated. It's all a guessing game, which can be both exciting and annoying. The film starts off marvelously, but because there's nothing to latch onto except a couple of great performances and some unlikable characters doing weird things, by the end, I felt I had become kind of numb to what was happening, and at times, kind of irritated.Bad films often has unresolved plot points, and an unclear purpose, and characters that are hard to relate to. This movie has all three of these things, but Paul Thomas Anderson has proved before that he knows what he's doing, so these all must be intentional, right? I would imagine so. Nonetheless, the line between a terrible film and an original and great film is very thin. We have faith that Anderson didn't throw us into a story for no reason, just like we would have no faith if a director like Uwe Boll did the same thing. This film is completely about interpretation and finding your own themes, and everything I disliked about the movie was probably intentional. The characters are distant, the point unclear, and the ending so vague and inconsequential, it makes ""No Country For Old Men""'s ending seem like an average Hollywood ending. Basically, the movie is frustrating. It's got a lot of stuff to like, including a very strange score from Radiohead member Johnny Greenwood, but as a whole, it adds up to nothing, or potentially a lot of things depending on what you personally drew from it. It's neat when writers and directors deviate from the norm, but in this case, it just makes the two hours plus invested in it feel somewhat wasted. My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 142 mins. R for sexuality, language, alcohol abuse and some violence."
421,The Master,6,12 November 2012,This may be Paul Thomas Anderson's best film... and his worst.,"The Master is a slow-boil character study focused on the interplay between a radical philosopher and an eccentric alcoholic. The film begins with the viewer looking at water escaping from the back of a traveling boat. It is a beautiful shot that lingers giving you a sense of motion and time--escapism. Eery orchestrations follow, reminiscent of There Will Be Blood's disturbing score. Right from the start, I felt much more ambition from Anderson. What I like most about this film is the complexity. The journey is maddening. Frustrating. And it is hard to care for either of the main characters. But I simultaneously found their flaws captivating. One is perverted with sexual compulsions and with the other, you're not sure if he is driven more by proving his philosophy to others or to himself. Like his previous film, Anderson does not try to tie us into the character, but rather fascinate us with them--only this time, he takes on two characters equally as, if not more, complex as Daniel Plainview in Blood.The acting is very strong in all corners. Phoenix is in total control of his role and it is refreshing to have him back in top form. Philip Seymour Hoffman is even more powerful and equally eccentric. Atmosphere is great. Cinematography, score, lighting, great. The production quality all around was not just good, but great. It is a bold reminder of why I admire this director as much as I do. However, ultimately, for a great movie to work, it has to come together. And this is where I find it lacking. The movie was too long, could have used better editing, and weak in its exploration of such thought-provoking and controversial subject material. Also, between Phoenix and his love interest, the age range was too wide. Having to watch a 40- year-old kiss a teenager was cringe-worthy. Let me stress: in technicality, this is Anderson's best. The film is beautiful, the screenplay has depth, and he brings out the best in his actors. Towards the beginning, there is a brilliant scene where Phoenix is forced to avoid blinking during a barrage of personal questions as we learn revelations about his character in less than a minute. It is overwhelming and captivating. I just wish the rest of the film kept up that momentum, but it falls flat. I believe that perhaps I will grow to like it with each subsequent viewing because, although I did not find the film entirely satisfying, I reflected on it quite a bit. The beginning has promise and the ending is thought-provoking, but the middle act frustrated me more than it entertained me.As a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, I have been looking forward to this film for a long time. Is it a failure? No. Is it a disappointment? Yes. It is as aesthetically pleasing as it is thought-provoking, but the narrative does not support the magnitude of Anderson's ambitious double character study. This is a rich film in idea and presentation, but stale in its construction.The Master is certainly something I will be visiting again down the line, but if it has some profound message, it fails to come across in one convoluted viewing."
422,The Master,6,10 October 2012,Baffled,"This film does not have universal appeal. It was excellently made, and I cannot fault the acting or direction at all. However, I would probably be better able to judge the acting and direction if I had a better idea of what this film was intended to convey. I am rather baffled.I have clicked the ""spoilers"" box, even though I don't exactly know what I could say to spoil the film. The plot? A definite eccentric with a definitely eccentric family takes in a psychotic substance abuser. Do the eccentricities work any kind of change in the psychotic? Well, he does have a brief interpersonal encounter without sex or violence, so perhaps that is an improvement. But is that relatively minor change the justification for sitting in a theater for over two hours? I am not opposed to quiet, thoughtful films which take their time in getting to the point, such as ""The Tree of Life."" In that film, I could find some personal point of reference. But in ""The Master,"" I am not sure what I am supposed to take from this, because I could not find anything with which to identify.Perhaps this was to be a slice of life with interesting characters. Perhaps a partial personal history of two characters. The ultimate effect on me was similar to reading a history book--a lot of information, and possibly very well organized and presented, but what's the point? I don't know, and I don't think a second viewing will make anything clearer. Other than perhaps there is no point to be made.Also, I note that the early user reviews were glowing, and the glow faded a bit as time went on."
