0,Moana,5,6 December 2016,"Cookie-cutter, albeit beautiful, slice of Disney cheese","Tell me if you've seen this movie:Princess wants to do something a parent doesn't want her to do. Close friend/relative inspires her to be/do it anyway. Princess meets wacky sidekick. Prince and wacky sidekick don't get along but are forced to work together. Princess and wacky sidekick bond. Conflict happens and princess and wacky sidekick part ways. Princess continues on. Wacky sidekick shows up out of nowhere to help princess. Princess and wacky sidekick win, become friends forever. Parent realizes they were wrong, encourages princess to be/do whatever.I felt like I already knew the plot to this film because I had seen it 100 times before. Why didn't I rate it lower? Because it's visually stunning. The style of this film is very unique and I like the way they wove Samoan artistic sense into it. I found myself mesmerized at the water effects and the animals more than anything else.Fun for kids, but nothing you haven't seen before."
1,Moana,9,8 February 2017,what a delight!,"Wow, what a great great movie! The visuals in this movie are breathtaking!! They are so gorgeous! But, besides the visuals there is such a heart and imagination and creativity to this movie. Moana is such a likable, smart, and relatable person. the voice work for Moana is so sweet and so good. The chemistry between Moana and Maui is so great and so natural. The songs in this movie are so charming, catchy and fun! But, How Far I'll Go is such an emotional song and it has such heart...I dare say I like it a little more than Let It Go! The way Moana sings it and you can feel it!! Wow, I just looved this movie and it is great for kids and adults. I will always love it and I wanna see it again!"
2,Moana,10,5 December 2016,I know that chicken ... I voted for him .... TWICE!,"Instant classic.Easily ranks among the best from the Disney Studio, and a very worthy successor to Mulan 1998, a similar story equally well done.Oddly also seems to be best work ever from Dwayne Johnson, perhaps not the first name I would have associated with ""voice acting,"" but a star turn nonetheless.If you want to be picky -- which is the reviewer's job, after all -- the momentum slows a little at the top of the third act, but the ultimate themes of redemption, forgiveness and self-discovery at the finale are an absolute joy.As they used to say, ""for children of all ages."""
3,Moana,6,19 March 2017,"Visually beautiful, but problems with plot and characterization cause this movie to stumble.","I have been largely unimpressed with Disney's recent animated movies, and many of my criticisms with them hold true with Moana. Looking back at Wreck-It Ralph, Zootopia, and Frozen, it seems to me that Disney is more interested in building a visually beautiful world than building a great story. This is true with Moana. The animation is wonderful. The world is gorgeous. The story, however, is rather dull and shallow.The world is by design fairly sparse. There aren't a lot of characters in this movie. So to make up for that, the story or the characters need to be particularly compelling. Unfortunately, they aren't.Disney breaks no new ground with Moana's story. That isn't new for Disney, and to be fair, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. Many good movies are just well-done re-imaginings of classic stories. But Moana isn't even that. At every step of the way, I couldn't shake a feeling that I'd seen it all before. The story never gripped me nor did it leave me feeling fulfilled. Thus, the film just feels empty.If either Moana or Maui were engaging characters, this movie could have been good. Despite a good performance from Auli'i Cravalho, Moana had a very small character arc. She was not that different a person at the end of the film than she was at the beginning. For much of the film, she had very little agency of her own. The plot seemed to carry her along, rather than she driving the plot.Maui did everything he could to cause the plot to stall. This could have been great, as his antagonistic attempts to stop the main character could have worked as the central conflict. But since Moana is rarely actually trying to move the plot forward, the conflict just seems to be her-vs-him, which is mildly interesting at best.It's a shame. Moana could have been such a good movie. But it suffers from the same failings as most recent Disney animated ventures: wonderfully crafted world without a story worthy of that world."
4,Moana,8,3 January 2017,You're Welcome.,"2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the mouse.Legend has it that demigod Maui stole a sacred stone, the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. The lava demon confronted him and both the heart and Maui were lost forever. Now, the world is slowly dying and someone must find the heart and force Maui to put it back. But who is this chosen one? It might be Moana, a Polynesian girl who is suppose to be taking over as chief of her tribe, but longs to sail beyond the reef. Featuring new comer Auli'i Carvalho as Moana and the most electrifying man in sports entertainment, Dwayne 'The Rock"" Johnson, as the demigod Maui. It's not surprising that I found myself tapping my feet to the songs in this film because Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of Hamilton, shares his talent with this film. I can easily see any one of the songs in this piece going up for and winning Best Original Song, giving the man the O in the prestigious PEGOT award circle. He currently has a Pulitzer, Emmy, Tony and Grammy, among more. The songs here remind me of the old-school Disney songs, easy to listen to, fun to play on repeat and important to the story. At first, I felt it was a little too on the nose with some of the lyrics, but eventually he won me over and I've been listening to the soundtrack ever since. The film itself might lack some of the intricacies of plot heavy films like Zootopia, but this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt. The vibrant colours of the green islands and the blue sea help propel the film above and beyond what some others films have to offer. The animation takes a nice little turn for the creative when the characters find themselves under the sea in a side villains lair. We are treated with some bioluminescent sequences with another catchy tune not far behind. Johnson is stellar as Maui, he seems completely comfortable in a voice acting role and surprisingly has the chops to sing a tune. Newcomer Auli'i Carvalho holds her own against a star like Johnson and she really gives a strong voice to a driven female character. I applaud that Disney didn't feel the need to shoehorn in a love story either. This is a tale about self discovery, not some young woman needing to find a man. Disney nods and respects their past while looking to the future with Moana. Princesses no longer need to be the 'love' goal of a man. Moana is a visually beautiful film with great songs and a strong female lead character. There are some visually gags for the kids and a great time for adults. Moana is a great film."
5,Moana,8,21 February 2017,A Fun Movie (must watch),"Henny's Movie Review: Moana (aka Vaiana)In three words: A Fun Movie.With Pixar dropping the ball lately it is good to see that Disney is picking it up with great movies like, Tangled, Zootopia and now Moana. Yes, they made a mediocre over-hyped movie named Frozen, read my previous review for my thoughts about that movie. Moana really doesn't disappoint it has a good pacing, a great cast, and it is BEAUTIFUL. I could just leave my review at this and tell you to go and watch this movie, but let's see ""How Far I'll Go"".Moana is a story that takes place in Ancient Polynesia, when a curse reaches the island Mata Nui a chieftain's daughter is determined to go on a journey, to find a demigod named Maui in order to stop the curse.Like most Disney movies this is a coming of age story. Moana is a chieftain's daughter who is struggling with her love for her people and her love for the ocean. She is determined and a strong character. It is wonderful to see her grow and find herself throughout the movie. She is voiced by Auli'I Cravaljo and it fits like a glove, perfect love her accent. Moana is joined by a demigod named Maui. He starts out as an egotistical/funny character but we quickly learn why and see him change for the better. He is voiced by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and if you know The Rock YOU know what to expect. You can never go wrong with The Rock.Other supporting characters were there to setup the plot and exposition.The music, as expected, was typically Disney which is a good thing because I love Disney songs. After the movie you just can't get it out of your head. All the scores were very good. It did the basics like underscoring a scene but it also carried the movie for a huge part.The three-act-structure. Moana has a great beginning, good middle, and a great ending. Furthermore, the pacing of this movie is fast in a good way. It doesn't hold on to a scene for too long and the movie knows when to cut.The cinematography was beautiful it really shows that the creators have done their research. I love the bright colors and gorgeous sceneries. It would appear that Disney's new approach to movie making is starting to pay-off, by remaking their old animated movies into real-life and mocking their old movies with their new 3d-animated movies, they are breathing new life into their movies. As aforementioned in the introduction Moana is a must see movie that won't disappoint.I give this movie a 8.5."
6,Moana,4,28 December 2016,The pay-off is not worth the build-up,"So I watched Moana and boy, what a lazy movie it was. So full of good ideas, squandered on a passable family movie. And yes, I know it's Disney making a family movie, but it had all these ideas that would make a great story if they were taken more seriously. The premise of the movie is basically the whole world dying because of what someone did and they treat this catastrophic event as an annoyance instead of something actually serious.The protagonist is Moana, an absolutely average Disney princess type of character that wants to say no to being stuck in a life of safety and luxury. We've seen it a thousand times by now, it's nothing that stands out or even something logical in the long run since these types of sheltered characters do not know anything about the outside world and are in effect useless on their own.And I have to point this out about her which is one of the many things they didn't bother to clarify. Why is everybody fine with a girl being their leader? Do they have gender equality on this otherwise primitive island? If they do, they never showed it because any other leader we see in their history was a guy. Combined with how she doesn't drown 1 minute after going into the sea with zero experience further proves this movie is empowerment fantasy for little girls instead of a movie where talent and intelligence matter.But it's OK because the scriptwriter did his worst to plot armor her from any possible danger. Because you see, the gods chose her to be the one who restores the world, thus every time she falls in water, a magical wave takes her on the boat. When she doubts her abilities, the ghosts of her ancestors appear to motivate her. She is essentially a plot device fully controlled by the plot instead of doing what she wants and facing the repercussions of her mistakes.And if you think calling her the chosen one properly excuses all the nonsense, it doesn't because the gods make no sense. Why did they wait a thousand years to do something about a disaster that has killed most of the islands, and of all people why did they choose a little girl with no skills or experience of the outside world? They never explain it.Do you know what else they didn't explain? Why her pet pig doesn't grow up. She begins as a little girl and grows up to a teenager, but the damn thing remains a piglet throughout the whole movie. Nobody in the production team gave a damn.The problems don't even stop there. The first thing she has to do is find Maui, a demigod who has been stuck on a barren island for a thousand years and is the only person who can save the world. He is also the one who doomed it, so that makes sense. Also, for a guy who spent a millennium all alone without something to eat or do on a tiny island, he sure looked fine when she appeared. Disney went so safe and lazy on him that he is nothing but a cool guy who does cool things and has absolutely no sex drive, or psychological trauma for being left alone all this time.Accompanying them on their journey is a retarded chicken. It's the most annoying comic relief animal I have seen in my life. It's not funny, it causes more trouble than aid, and they never eat it although they never seem to have enough food. How the hell did it get on the boat in the first place? Moana didn't take it with her, it just appeared out of nowhere in the secret cave nobody had been in for centuries. Nobody in the production team gave a damn.You probably think I am being too harsh on what is supposed to be a dumb movie for kids, when I'm not since they clearly put effort in fleshing out the characters in a way that demands from the story to be better. Moana's father has a good reason for not letting her out in the sea. Maui has a good reason for why he keeps going on adventures and tries to impress the mortals. Even the villain of the movie has a reason for why she is evil. These are really good stuff, and they are ruined by the lazy script.If the movie was like that in all its aspects, I wouldn't be bothered by it. But when you set it up in a way that obviously raises the bar like that, the disappointment multiplies when you treat your good ideas like a joke. I can easily sum up all these problems as cheap resolutions. Everything is fixed way too fast despite the problems building up for countless years. The father changed his mind way too fast and lets his daughter sail in the sea, Maui changed his mind and returned to help her without even showing us how, and the goddess forgives Maui instantly, despite causing her pain and suffering for a thousand years, as well as wiping out the life of countless islands and filling the sea with monsters. Hell, even the disease that was slowly killing the islands went away in a few seconds despite spreading slowly for centuries.This movie is so freaking lazy. The pay-off is not worth the build-up, its ideas are not used properly, and all you end up getting is a generic Disney princess and a retarded chicken."
7,Moana,9,27 February 2017,refreshingly Polynesian,"From the opening lyrics to the final shot, Moana was a fun glimpse into Polynesian life. Reminds me of Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron with its depiction of tribal peoples, people who depend on the land and environment to live. As one of the several catchy songs say, the island gives them everything they need. No need to go beyond the reef.I'm glad that Moana and Zootopia, Disney's two most recent feature films, humorously refer to the archetypal Disney traits that appear in film after film -- i.e. an animal sidekick, the heroine bursting into song, following your dreams. Even if they do year after year, it never gets old. (... Well, maybe a little bit. I'm actually jaded by the happy ending trope in practically every work of film, literature, etc. out there. But that's beside the point.) Even if you can predict the ending of Moana, it's not quite what you expected. Disney has recently been changing things up a bit and having creative endings. Frozen, for example. Even if they weren't slightly creative, the story still enacts the Disney magic -- the ability to inspire, motivate, uplift, and ultimately enlighten further on mankind's communal desire to go beyond the norm. You don't have to do something amazing to make a name for yourself. It's not the hook that defines you, it's what you do that defines you and makes you who you are. Just don't follow hard tradition all the time. If someone says you can't achieve your dreams, he/she is most likely right. HOWEVER. That's only true if you don't give it your all. Those right now who are living their dreams gave it their all. If it's something you really want, after all, then naturally you'll give it the necessary effort and force of will. It won't be easy; life wasn't meant to be easy.It's not as amazing as Zootopia, but Moana is still a genuinely good Disney movie. It has a superb single, a nice accompanying soundtrack, great characters, sublime animation with crystal- clear attention to detail, and wonderful themes and messages. I admit, I was expecting too much from Moana after seeing Zootopia, which is probably why I give Moana a 9. Zootopia hits the 10. If you haven't seen either one, I recommend seeing Moana first."
8,Moana,9,4 February 2017,Still playing to full theaters,"I saw ""Moana"" tonight in the local movie theater. I have been wanting to see it since Thanksgiving and expected the audience to be few. To my amazement the cinema was almost full, and I can see why. ""Moana"" is a fabulous movie--it will certainly leave you crying and smiling. I would imagine most of the folks in the audience now have seen it 3 or 4 times. I served a number of years in the Army in Hawaii, so I was attracted to the movie for that reason, and it was certainly a great movie going experience. The animated graphics capture the magic and beauty of Polynesia, the land and the ocean. And the story is a lot of fun. Highly recommended for all ages."
9,Moana,9,5 March 2017,"Beautiful in every sense, Moana will soften even the hardest of hearts","Moana is a return to the classic Disney formula, the clichés and characters ripped from a number of other animated films. However, the pure beauty and skill of the production rises the old story into new heights.Following from the success of Zootropolis, Moana follows a more traditional narrative we know and love; the princess who wishes for something more and is whisked on a supernatural adventure. We know this story so well yet Moana seems fresh and thrilling as if the plot was innovative. Perhaps this is due to the Polynesian setting or the morally ambiguous Maui, played perfectly by Dwayne Johnson, but most likely it is it the simple magic of Disney  the wonder for both children and adults has reached its peak with the perfection of the classic formula. For once, the clichés make the film more enjoyable. The quality of the animation helps too: it's clear they have reached the pinnacle of blending realistic textures with stylised designs, creating an aesthetic beauty that few other companies can match  Disney have mastered water to the point it looks better animated than in real life! Even the music has been perfected here, the annoying catchiness of Frozen's tunes replaced by memorable but effective songs that fit the culture and setting of our adventure. A childlike warmth was awakened in me and many other adult members of the audience as the film brought the emotional highs of the Disney renaissance without the modern subversion of the classic tropes. While Moana sometimes threatens this with pop culture references, the film thankfully keeps to mostly traditional values and morals; a step above many children's animated films released today.Moana is good, old fashioned Disney magic; the traditional narrative and morals updated with stellar animation and an awareness that's effective but never overpowering enough to threaten the integrity of the Disney formula.SWEETVisit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more."
10,Moana,7,12 April 2017,Eeeesh...,"Oh... my... word...A girl wants to go where her dad won't let her, wants to do what her dad won't let her. Hmm.. sound familiar? Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Poca... Pocahontas, Mulan, Brave and just about every modern Disney. Let's look at gender then Disney, seeing as you're OBSESSED with it:Male characters: Dad - scared, repressive, short-sighted, wrong. Demi-God chap - selfish, conceited, vain, ineffective, emotionally repressed, thief. Crab - as above (I'm assuming he's male). Coconut Pirates - murderous but ineffectual (I'm assuming their male).Female characters: Moana - bright eyed, aspirational, quick learner, visionary, empathetic, brave, strong, amazing, indefatigable, indomitable, perceptive. Granny - as above plus supernaturally gifted. Earth Goddess thingy - was only trying to kill people because the male character had robbed her of her precious.Yawn. Increasingly Disney is working as a SJW - righting perceived inbalances in society. They have obviously perceived a gender imbalance biased towards males in society and have therefore produced their own version of the world where the gender imbalance is biased heavily and totally towards the females. Everything else in the film is nice ."
11,Moana,2,30 November 2016,About the most boring movie I've seen in my life.,"Personally, I thought this movie was boring, so boring to where there were only a couple jokes I found somewhat funny the entire movie, yes this is one of those more song driven movies that are with very little humor, it also appeared as the people I went with(which one of them was a little kid who was laying on one of our arms for half the movie and it wasn't late either, it started at like 12:50 PM I think) wasn't that into it either. First, about the first hour before she got on her adventure was extremely boring, not much was happening and it was all just her not wanting to go, actually during this time, I was so bored, that I went to the bathroom and took my time(usually I run to get back to the movie) and when I got out, I actually got on my phone and looked at how ""bad"" the reviews would be for this movie, it turns out I was very wrong, it has very good reviews and I was surprised. When I got back in there, a little later it got slightly more interesting after she got on her boat, but it still was pretty boring, I even went to the bathroom a second time even though I probably could've held it. I don't think I've been to a more boring movie in my life, the songs seemed pretty generic and I know at least 1 repeated itself later on the movie. I personally didn't care for Frozen either though which I think is the market this is aimed for. This is honestly making me start to lose hope in Disney, I think they've done messed up TV, and now they're messing up movies it seems. I think it is overrated but that's just my opinion. All I can say is that if you like Frozen, you'd probably like this movie. But if you didn't care for Frozen, you'd probably find this one of the most boring movies of your life. I don't even think it's me outgrowing cartoons, I like cartoons but this is just boring, I think it may be they're all aimed for little kids(probably little girls for this one) now, whatever happened to family movies. This movie was so boring, that I was literally able to tell what kind of plot it has, it has a Hero's Journey plot in case you're wondering, I know a lot of movies have the plot, but it's not supposed to be this plain obvious to where I can tell either while or right after I watched the movie. I also think this being about some fictional religion was just weird, like how were the islanders in trouble when the darkness was like halfway around the world, then why would that goddess be that thing that was trying to kill them, it would make more since if we could've saved 10 minutes by her just saying to give her the thing then and that she was the goddess but no, gotta make it obvious about that Hero's Journey plot, seriously. So overall I wouldn't recommend this movie to hardly anyone unless they like Frozen and I personally find this movie very overrated."
12,Moana,1,23 November 2016,Please Stop Singing,"Another typical Disney movie of princess, magic, spells, curses, and CONFUSION. I wont spoil it but if you like musical girlie types like FRozen then you'll probably love this. Otherwise, trust me you will be like whats going on? Why is this taking so long? get to the point already. It just drags and drags and drags. It is also somewhat predicable..you'll see what i mean if you go see this. But i HIGHLY recommend you Don't waste your time and money on this movie. If you really want to see it that bad..wait for the DVD...trust me it isn't worth it. At one point in the movie even The Rock says please stop singing. Two good things i can say. The short story before the movie started was outstanding. Its called Inner Workings. Absolutely amazing and well done. Moana also exhibits incredible computer animation. Other than that IT IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I warned you!"
13,Moana,3,11 March 2017,Cookie Cutter Story Again,"Moana is simplistic plot. Surround a young quasi-islander girl with a big over-weight quasi-demi-god, a few animal ""friends"", a father afraid of going out beyond the reef because his friend drowned? and a need to return a stone to its source because that demi-god stole it? while disrespecting the father/chief? and becoming a leader of the people before the father dies? of which, women weren't allowed to be chiefs?Disney's ability to dilute any folklore is well-known, in order to make a quick buck by selling junk merchandise to kids. The tattoo suit was a terrible idea, but kudos for pulling it off the shelf quickly.Disney has a habit also of producing ""girl power"" movies, which I find to be cookie-cutter style. Disney has found a formula and they rinse-repeat with the characters, music and script. Recently this has been true with movies like Frozen, Tangled and Brave.In the meantime, Disney ignores the male lead role with the ability to change and overcome challenges in life. (12) movies in the past have featured male leads but none of which meet the standards set forth today by Disney standards for female lead roles. No, I don't include Pixar movies.Of those (12) movies, only two have meaningful scripts and two have sad endings. Peter Pan (1953), Sword in Stone (1963), Jungle Book (1967/2016), Black Cauldron (1985), Aladdin (1992), Hunchback (1996), Hercules (1997), Tarzan (1999), Emperor's New Groove (2000), Treasure Planet (2002), Brother Bear (2003), Meet Robinson's (2007). I could really dig deep and trash this movie for all the things they got wrong, but I'm going to skip it and just point out the few things I liked about the movie.(1) The animation is good. (2) The movie is about the Pacific Islanders. (meh) There was one tune I thought was catchy, the rest were crapThat's it. The rest of the movie is junk to me. It is a cookie- cutter movie with the same theme, with the same songs, with the same direction. Sure there are some amusing parts of the movie, but over all I really didn't care for it.I also was disappointed in the use of ""Disney staff from the Disney resort"" who are of native heritage for the bonus features. It became obvious to me that Disney was doing a fluff piece to show the general public that ""islanders"" love working on the movie, which is a partial truth.Overall this movie is an amusing production which will satisfy the little kids and the simpletons. If Disney really wanted to make a movie about diversity they could make the same movie about a gay boy trying to be chief after his father dies."
14,Moana,4,31 December 2016,"Kids liked it OK, I thought it was forgettable","Animation is good (except surely not all Polynesians are so stocky and have such large cankles???). I liked the Moana character and her outfit was cute. Maui not so much, such an overblown caricature it was ridiculous!!! My 9 year old granddaughter thought his moving tattoos were silly. She and her 7 year old brother enjoyed it OK, but I doubt if they would want to see it again. I know I don't!! The plot was formulaic and none of the characters (except Moana) were memorable. I don't recall any memorable songs, either. The movie needed a MUCH better plot and more in-depth characters. Go back to the drawing board, Disney!! Some of my granddaughter's old Barbie movies (like ""Pegasus"") had better and more memorable stories!!"
15,Moana,3,3 December 2016,"Beautiful animation, predictable storyline","A friend and I went with the kids to watch Moana last night. I loved seeing Polynesian islands in animation again. The scenery is beautiful--much more of it, and more vivid compared to Lilo and Stitch. The storyline was typical Disney, of course. I feel like I've seen this movie a dozen times before. I would add that I am getting tired of seeing male characters portrayed as cowardly, ignorant, and/or irresponsible. This movie succeeds in that aspect, which is disappointing. Having sons, it would be nice to see a movie where a young man is the hero. Instead, we seem to find thattoo many of Disney's children's movies feature a heroine with weak male characters around her. Other than the above-mentioned observation and the glorifying of pagan belief systems, it was an entertaining and uplifting movie."
16,Moana,1,31 January 2017,Bad Message on Parenthood,"Unlike ""Bolt"" and ""Zootopia"", Disney tried again another musical, i.e., people singing instead of talking. That apart, unlike other Disney musicals, e.g., ""Mulan"" and ""Tangled"", the songs in this film are very repetitive. I lost count of how many time the main character's song is reprised, with maybe slightly different lyrics every time, but I stopped caring after the second one. The explorer's song, one of the few with Polynesian language thrown-in and that doesn't sound like a cheap Western European cartoon musical, is somewhat ""fine"", although also repeated unnecessarily too many times. Maui's and Tamatoa's songs are happily jazzy and unfitting with the film, but helped me to survive till the obvious ending.Yes, the ending is squarely obvious after the first few minutes, just after the story of Maui's deed is told. The producers tried to make it less obvious by hiding the spiral on Te Ka's chest, but it's a Disney cartoon, who couldn't tell that Maui would come back to help (actually, who couldn't tell he would eventually ditch Moana in the worst possible situation, just to raise the ""thrill""?), who couldn't tell that it would be Moana to fix everything (and not Maui, despite all his godly powers), who couldn't tell that it would have a perfectly colossal happy ending...?! Even the only character to die returns Obi-Wan-Kenobilistically to help Moana (what just makes sense, I guess, as Disney now owns the Star Wars franchise). Seriously, spoilers? Disney created a type of film which makes all spoilers simply meaningless (like, who couldn't tell the ending of ""Frozen"" just by seen the poster, with the two sisters side by side?) Granted happy ending is not fun, at all (and no, watching ""how"" the characters get there is not enough nowadays for enjoyment, this is not opera, this is cinema).Maui is by far the best character, but just like Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"", absolutely unimportant for the plot (except for stealing the heart of Tahiti, oops, ""Te Fiti"", which any other unrelated character could have done, any and everything he did was useless to change the course of the story). Maui's self-conscious line asking Moana not to start singing was funny, but the fun vanished swiftly as the songs restarted filling up the space where actual story should be. I have to regard Heihei, the chicken, funny, although fully useless, too (don't worry, if it wasn't there, the stone would have fallen in the ocean, and it would have returned it to Moana, just like it did before).Why is Moana the main character? There was no need for the character to be female, unlike Mulan or Merida. For the plot, Moana could be a shrimp, it wouldn't make any difference. I guess Disney wants to sell more toys to girls, and that's all. According to psychologists, men have a need to outstand, women have a need to fit in (this is not Wikipedia, you look for the references!) Thus, boys take any crap you throw at them, as long as it has flashy LED's and makes a lot of noise. Girls are usually more picky, they use to choose what appeals to them somehow (even if only because ""everybody at school has one""). Heroines have a better chance to sell them anything, I suppose, so there comes another female leading character. Do you doubt it? Disney went as far as making Maui literally label Moana as a ""princess"", what she vehemently denies, just to make it sink even deeper in the brains of the young. That's pure evil!Talking about evil, why are the parents always the evil people that don't let the heroine be, well, heroic (or even have a little fun)?! It had to be the fun-funny-and-cool, sweeter-than-honey, always friendly/compassionate, knowing-better-than-the-parents Grandmother the one to help Moana. Granny inflamed her desire to disobey her father's orders, which almost got herself drowned, what was exactly what he was trying to save her from (what is also completely nonsensical, as the ocean for far too many times saves her and others from drowning, to the point I stopped worrying that any character could die). That was a very evil message, that anyone can be a better friend than the parents. Sure, there are bad parents out there, but that was clearly not the case, as he was trying to protect her. Disney poisoning!The plot has so many holes (some of which I have already exposed) that the ending is almost detached from the rest of the film. For example, why didn't the ocean simply return the stone to Te Fiti, why did it need a human to do the job? Moana wouldn't be able to do it without the help of the ocean, which opened a path to Te Ka.The background message, ""don't mess with Nature"", was weak, far below ""Mononoke Hime"" or even ""Over The Hedge"". It's absolutely unbelievable that this film got such high scores. Those scores tell much more about the ""status quo"" of contemporary society than the film's quality.Why do I bother coming here to blemish this film? Because it's an evil film, by an evil corporation, watched by too many children out there."
17,Moana,2,3 December 2016,Moan Of A Movie,"Disney is such a cliché. This must be the most over-hyped crap of a movie since Frozen. Was Jar Jar Abrams also involved in this? That's how bad and formulaic this thing is.I cannot believe the people who give this a perfect score. is it the first and only film they have seen? This is an awful movie. The first 2/3 of it are just frantic, predictable cultural jokes, and near the end it becomes an awkward mix between true romance/drama and slapstick heroism with the standard-issue 2015/2016 females lead cliché (Ghostbusters, Maleficient, Frozen, Star Wars, X-Men, etc.). Don't be fooled by the long list of great reviews here...they are not reviews they are indications of low class of the writers who compensate for their inadequacies. I'm not even sure what the merit of yet another Disney princess film is, it's so bad. Not recommended unless you are very easily amused, or a mother who must say it was good to keep up with Joneses after the little bratess wanted to go watch it."
18,Moana,5,15 December 2016,Great soundtrack and visually creative but nothing much else to offer,"The positives: -Great soundtrack. FROZENesque, epic, catchy monologues that repeat in your head. Added with Lion King like incomprehensible but fun tunes with a Hawaiian twist this time. -Beautiful and creative visuals. One in particular I enjoyed a lot was the UNDER underwater world where the ocean served as the sky. The striking beautiful blue/turquoise water with lush green islands were treat for the eyes -No silly, typical Disney, forced romances. -Passes the Bechdel test easilyThe negatives: -Filled with clichés, unoriginal and overused themes, tropes, characters and dialogue etc.... -A lot of trouble with building engagement early on. All over the place with a lot of shifts -Annoyingly predictable, unfunny characters. Specially Maui with such cringe worthy, lame jokes. Maybe i'm too old to be amazed by easy punch lines, that end of the day are meant for kids -difficulty with tonal focus. -unnecessary, out of place scene with coconut pirates that add nothing to the story -lacked the charm and wonder i expect in a kids movie.My rating: -5/10 -Neither original or interesting but has one or two things going for it to be not disregarded. -Compared to other animated family movies this year, I would rank this below Finding Dory but above The Secret Life of Pets."
19,Moana,10,6 March 2017,Beautiful Movie,"This film is absolutely fantastic. Great CGI, great story, great voice cast, great music, and all around great everything. This truly is an instant cult classic that is going to go down in history as one of Disneys best. The CGI is beautifully detailed and polished. The sea and the hair of the characters look almost completely real. The story is absolutely amazing as well. It's not only thought provoking, but it also has everything, such as happiness, bravery, poignancy, and it just goes on a perfect flow that fits perfectly with what this film is about. The music is surprisingly pretty great in this film too. I think the writers did a splendid job with that as well. This film is beautifully animated and written, and I can't recommend this film enough for those who haven't seen it yet. I was pleasantly surprised and I think anyone who hasn't seen it yet will be as well."
20,Moana,2,27 November 2016,Formulaic and predictable,First I have to admit I do not like the name Moana. It sounds like someone is moaning. Moan-aaaa ahhhh no I really don't understand some people who have voted with ten stars this movie. It was not fun..predictable ..and not respected a lot the need to challenge. I think there is something suspicious is happening with the positive criticism here...simply don't listen to these trolls talking hallelujah about this movie claiming is it perfection - yes 10/10. I just feel sad for those who have give to that film that high rating. They are fooling themselves and I guess they have issues that need to take care of this issues with some professional help. I believe it is so unfair to see that a non entertaining comedy has 9 or 10 rating...and a fan movie has a low rating...all this makes me think that actually the rating system in here is for trash heads. Great job Disney...hope you stop buying votes in the future.
21,Moana,2,7 December 2016,Disney Conning America,"The most positive thing I can say about this movie is that it adheres to the formula very faithfully and it is not an unapologetic butchery like the new Star Wars. Apparently however, whether because of a lack of creativity or despite it, this film is extremely uncreative. At its best, which is a word one should not use about this film, it's how you imagined it. At its worst, if you've already watched Frozen, Snow White or Little Mermaid, it is frankly boring to watch and may disrupt the fancies of your imagination: I never imagined a girl sailing the ocean with a beefcake. The special effects don't go that far beyond stage play level and certainly don't live up to the reviews' descriptions. This movie has not been released to do anything new, and it's not worth the trouble obtaining watching in the theatre with 50 kids on smartphones around you. Read a book, cook or bake, actually talk to your children and think for yourself, or if you must enjoy some other movie on the same theme."
22,Moana,1,13 April 2017,"Yet again a musical, but not indicated","This is getting extremely tedious from Disney. Neither in the trailer, nor the description is it indicated that this movie is a musical! I detest musicals with a passion. I am not saying musicals are bad not enjoyable, by others, however I HATE, absolutely HATE them. Yet only Disney does not indicate clearly that their movies are musicals. The other one was Frozen."
23,Moana,7,15 June 2017,Meh. A pretty boring and average movie.,"The beginning was pretty interesting to me. But honestly, I expected more from this movie, more from Disney. So like I said, the beginning was pretty OK. But to me it just got more boring the more you watch it. Even the ending 'action' scene was pretty boring. I fell asleep 1/4 of the way into the movie, and I woke up on a scene kind of towards the middle. So it's pretty easy to say that the movie wasn't that good and it was too boring pretty much from the start.But my opinion might be because I like watching movies that are for older audiences, and Disney is just getting too old for me, but honestly, this movie isn't really that good in my opinion.I'd give it a 5 out of 10 because Disney didn't make this movie interesting enough for some older audiences to enjoy."
24,Moana,2,28 March 2017,"This Movie is one of the most stupid,generic,unfunny movies I've seen in a long time","I hate this Movie. Ironnicly,as I was walking up the stairs and into my seat, I had HIGH expectations. As I sat down excitement and the movie began...I hated the first few minutes. A few minites later added to the fire of my already burning hatred for it. Add 1 hour and 47 mins to that and I'm already clawing my eyes out. I'm gonna make this sweet and short. I felt like I was watching Frozen all over again, just with even more horrendous singing and somehow an even worse script. None of the jokes made me laugh, the best character in the whole movie was the chicken with the only trait as a character is being stupid and vulnerable and the only reason I didn't leave theatre was because it was new year's eve and I had nothing else to do. Can I say this?... This movie sucks..4/20(2/10)"
25,Moana,5,6 December 2016,"This was a letdown of a movie, I expected a lot more of Disney.","So Moana was boring. Not entirely a typical family and kids movie, but still very much in the same vein. It's not very funny, it relies on musical numbers more than it should and those musical numbers are mostly boring or annoying. There's a few good singing parts in it, but it's overshadowed by annoying musical numbers. It relies on pop-culture which is really out of place in a movie that's about Polynesian legends. One of the main characters makes a joke about Twitter in the movie which is completely out of taste and just isn't funny. It's a great visual spectacle, but a poor plot, but would hold up on its own it if wasn't throwing strange out of place jokes and very modern character behavior. I had very high hopes for this movie, and it really was a let down. It was boring, and rather shallow. At best from me a 5/10."
26,Moana,5,26 May 2017,"Starts out fun, but with MAJOR flaws","This movie starts out well, with enjoyable characters and a decent soundtrack. However, it suffers from too many flaws to be a good movie. I'm not sure how so many other reviewers loved it. Warning: this review may contain spoilers.Problem for those with small children: First off, it was too intense and at times scary for what is advertised as being a children's movie! I'm specifically referring to scenes with the lava demon, as well as when Moana first enters the ""realm of monsters"". I'm glad I didn't take my daughter to see it in theaters or we would have walked out. As is, we had to fast-forward at least 3 scenes on DVD. Lazy writing: It would have been nice if Moana had to prove her worth to Maui or do something that convinces him that he needs her help on his mission. Instead, Moana tags along with Maui because the ocean magically lifts her up and places her back on the boat! The ocean also gets Moana out of all sorts of trouble at various times throughout the movie. It would have been so much better if Moana learned to overcome these obstacles on her own. It is also never explained WHY the ocean chose her instead of someone else!BIGGEST plot hole: So at some point in a conversation between Moana and Maui it is explained that Maui does ~everything~ for his love of the people. Even though he comes across as self-centered, everything he does is supposedly for their benefit in one way or another. How about locking Moana in the cave on the desert island the first time they meet, with no food or water? Had Moana not escaped the cave via a combination of wits and luck, she surely would have perished while Maui was out searching for his hook! Even if she had managed to escape the cave but did so too slowly, she would have found a deserted island with no food, water or boat. I wanted to like this movie, but these flaws are too big to ignore."
27,Moana,3,4 December 2016,Lame rehash,"Awful - Just a rehash of the gurl ya can do it Disney princess Movies.I thought all the other recycled Disney princess movies were bad but to have this culturally sensitive gurl running around Quouting the wisdom of the universe and sweet old lady grandma sounding Stupid as she is just not funny anymore is embarrassing.Also wrestlers throwing in his obligatory growl now and again is annoying. Should have never brought in a wrestler who cannot act. Just because wrestler cannot act does not mean we need to hear him instead.Just like Santa Claus does not exist, spirits and ghosts do not exist. Stop instilling rubbish into children's heads Disney. When grandma dies she is done."
28,Moana,3,16 December 2016,It's just not up to Disney standards.,"Let's start with the characters. Moana is overly optimistic and superstitious, Maui is way too self involved, the grandmother is certifiable, and the father is willing to let his own people starve and his island die so that he doesn't have to confront his past. Then there's the music. The ocean song is kind of fun, but all the others are awful! Maui's is all about how he's some kind of gift of the gods, and then there's that weird song that the crab sings... And the plot! Every other Disney training montage shows a gradual change, but all through this movie, people just know how to do things! And Moana never accomplishes anything without someone else's help- Maui, her grandmother, the ocean... And Maui suddenly changes his mind about helping for no reason. And who didn't see it coming that the land goddess had become the lava monster. And let's not even talk about the sentient coconuts... Come on, Disney! You're supposed to be better than this."
29,Moana,3,10 August 2017,Still Disappointing,"Of course we all know that Disney has become a master of delivering a formula and we expect it, but this one is one of the worse cliché-ridden deliveries by Disney.I also did not realize it is a musical as I do not enjoy the voice or the music. I am just not a fan. You may be.Finally, The Rock should go the way of Adam Sandler and Jeff Goldblum and be considered a straight-to-video no-talent. Frankly, I only watched this because I used to do a girl named Moana at work, but otherwise even my kid thought the film was boring. Disney needs a new shtick because Star Wars is out of ideas and Marvel has already begun to wear down its audience."
30,Moana,4,12 August 2017,Forgettable,"Meh. Just meh. Super meh in fact. This movie is so meh that I don't even want to force myself into trying to remember it. But from what I do remember from this very forgettable film, it doesn't get ""good"" until the Rock's character makes his official appearance. Before that, the plot begins very repetitive like. Whatever, the plot is a dump anyway. I guess that is my biggest issue with the film; a super simplified story that feels like a Naruto filler. So yeah, mehhing up the movie."
31,Moana,5,22 December 2016,Good & Bad,"There was a lot to like about Moana. I liked the diversity in the movie and that the princess didn't have a love interest thrown in. There was some good comedic relief as well and great Disney visuals per usual.However, what killed this movie for me was the constant singing. I get that it's a Disney movie which means I should expect some singing, but it felt like there was singing scenes that flowed right into another singing scene. Basically, it felt more like a Disney musical than a movie.Had there been half as much singing, I think this would have been a phenomenal movie. But it felt like none of the characters could talk without breaking into song and dance."
32,Moana,10,27 November 2016,Absolute excellence by Disney AGAIN !!,"Moana (or Vaiana in my country and many other European countries) is an animated musical adventure directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. It is the second Disney movie this year after the incredible Zootopia that was released back in February, and now I can say it is the second incredible movie released by Disney in 2016. Moana is a very interesting and touching movie about a girl named Moana (Vaiana) who dreams of sailing the world. She is voiced by Auli'i Cravalho who does a fantastic job on the role with her insanely talented voice, singing all the wonderful songs that will very soon be considered as classics. Dwayne Johnson is great (as per usual) as Maui - a legendary shapeshifting demigod. He brings such a fun, lovely, and comforting voice to his character that very few actors can do. And he is great at singing too, which was a surprise for me. It also has great animation, with incredible visuals as we've come to expect in Disney movies nowadays. I truly believe that in this decade, Disney has absolutely taken over the reigns in the film industry, and especially on the animation side of things. With movies like Tangled, Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Zootopia and now Moana, Disney shows no sign of stopping in their road to greatness and taking over the world."
33,Moana,10,17 December 2016,Simply amazing,"This film is an epic in the truest sense and easily one of Disney's best ""Big Films"".It follows the classic ""quest"" type story of a girl growing up feeling she's destined for more than her quiet life and eventually finding she's the chosen one to go on a mission to save the world, but how it gets there is awe inspiring.The animation is second to none, at one point I had to do a double take that they didn't mix in a live action character. Thinking back to the original Toy Story, things have certainly come far.Unlike other Disney movies (and most movies in fact), Moana is perfectly capable of pursuing her goals completely by herself and doesn't have a love interest, which I think may be a first for a Disney film (it's actually a lot closer to a Miyazaki film in the way the hero is portrayed).The soundtrack is also exceptional, so much so that my 5 year old girl made me order the album after the film. The entire score evokes a sense of adventure and riding over the waves and is simply sublime.To sum up how good this film is, it was the second movie in which I've ever witnessed the theatre audience erupting into a round of applause when the credits rolled (the first was Interstellar).The movie no doubt has some flaws, but I'm giving it a 10 to balance out some unreasonably negative reviews on here, some of which read like they were written by people who have no seen the movie."
34,Moana,5,17 February 2017,"Great potential, but....","If you like Disney, I mean Disney classics, this is not one of that. The idea is to go to the roots, whit a lot of music, lot of songs, singing etc. Well that some time do a magic, but some time it doesn't.The story had a great potential, really great. Interesting mythology, adapted to a story. Something like ""Song of the sea"", not Celt mythology off course, but interesting. So much potential to build characters, to give a depth to whole story, to create cinema animated magic- but we get a stupid chicken, princess and a good narcissus magic guy. The whole story didn't catch that serious note, nothing was considered serious, the approach to the legend was, let do a lot of singing and wacky jobs and that is it. I won't say that is unwatchable, but you loose some interest after 15 minutes watching it. The main reason for that is that you can not find a respectable note, and off course, singing. SO MUCH SINGING... When I say singing, I mean unnecessary songs. They are rely not needed. If you take a songs, the whole movie would last around 30 minutes. But the biggest sin is that this story had a such potential. It is a rely, rely god story. It has everything, a drama, end of the world, demons, heroes, the whole Maori mythology, a fight between good and evil, a message, everything. But some jerk decided to take all that without a hitch of seriousness, and denied us a great Disney movie. The only surprise is that at the end Moana didn't kiss with a Maui. With all that in my mind, the move deserved a 5 out of 10. It has his moments of entertainment, and it has his moments of fun and laugh, it is a good movie for children aged 3 to 9, and that is it. Songs are simple, but not catchy, I watch a movie half a hour ago, and I'am trying to remember a melody of one of the song- I can't. To say at the end, if you have a kids age 3 to 9 it would be a great for them, and they will forget it soon."
35,Moana,8,4 January 2017,Typical Disney fare,"Let me be honest with you: there have only really been 3 Disney movies in this year and 10 years included and before it that really made me go ""Wow! They DIDN'T just pull another Disney here"". I say that very rarely because Disney has a particular formula that they know works and will give them loads of money... and BOY do they use it allot. If you don't believe me, think for a second: besides Wreck it Ralph, Zootopia, and Big Hero 6, what other PURE Disney (in no associated with Pixar Disney) animated movies HAVEN'T had numerous musical numbers, a female lead, a male supporting role, a comedic relief character, and some big journey to stop something bad from happening to the place that the main character lives in? I know it sounds oddly specific, but it's been played so many times by Disney that's actually more mundane at this point. You've seen in in allot of their hits, and by the next, you probably go into the theater telling yourself the same thing as the last: ""I'm ready for the new masterpiece!"". Moana is just another one of these films. Is it well written? Yes! Is it culturally diverse? Why would it not be? Is the animation beautiful and breathtaking at moments? Again, the answer is a resounding YES. While all those things are a saving grace for the film, the biggest issue I have in my mind with it is that I will probably forget it's existence in the years to come, Oscar, Golden Globe, WHATEVER, or not! Moana is excellently produced, but none of that matters to me when the writing and overall story arc basically amount to clichés that have been beaten to death already.Listen, if you LOVE Disney and couldn't give a Rat's Tail about these clichés, go ahead and go see the film, you'll probably love it because it's Disney. That said, however, if you DO care for more than a small amount of originality like I do, then maybe it's worth a rental, but that's about it. Again, Moana is excellently produced and will most likely leave a smile on your face... but it's also a convincing case study for all the clichés Disney has been stuffing into their films as of late."
36,Moana,9,27 March 2017,Another winning movie from Disney.,"Most people had assumed that ""Moana"" would be the best animated movie of 2016. The idea of an Disney Animation Studios film being set in the Polynesians seemed different for the studio, but also exciting. Being on a long distance airplane ride, I decided to give the film a watch. While it was certainly not the absolute best of 2016 (""Finding Dory"" or ""Zootopia"" would have that distinction), ""Moana"" is still a great movie. It's great story, some fun characters, the most gorgeous animation, and some catchy songs makes it another great movie from Disney Animation Studios, the studio that showed audiences that they can make great movies once again.The film begins with the a tale being told of how the heart of the God, Te Fiti, being stolen by the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) as a gift for humanity. However, he is attacked by the lava demon Te Kā, and disappears with the heart and Maui's powerful fishhook lost to the ocean. We then meet Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), the daughter of the chief of the island Motunui. The island is slowly dying due to Te Kā's evil being spread with the heart of Te Fiti gone. However, the ocean gives Moana the heart and she is chosen to go find Maui and restore the heart of Te Fiti and save the world. Accompanied by her pet rooster Heihei (played by Disney's apparent ""good luck charm"" Alan Tudyk), she comes across Maui, some coconuts pirates, a crab (Jemaine Clement) obsessed with everything shiny, and the lava demon in one exciting journey.The one thing that ""Moana"" has over ""Zootopia"" is animation. The animation in this film is some of the best animation that I have seen from Disney in years. When it needs to be colorful, it's colorful. When it needs to be dark, it's dark. I also really like the 2D animation of Maui's tattoos animated by animation legend Eric Goldberg (who also animated the Genie in ""Aladdin""). I would describe the 2D animation if artwork from Hawaii was crossed with Keith Haring's art. The story is also really is well done. It's adventurous and exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat like a good movie should. I also really like the performances, particularly Cravalho's. She is a phenomenal actress and singer and for a debut film, that's quite an accomplishment. She performs Moana like how a sixteen year old girl should (unlike Rihanna's awful performance in ""Home""). Dwane Johnson is also fun and funny as Maui, and I also thought his singing was pretty good. Speaking of singing, I should probably talk about the songs. Written by Lin Manuel Miranda, who took the world by storm with ""Hamilton"", the songs are some of Disney's best in history, even better than ""Frozen"". They're catchy and memorable and they also tie into the story as a good musical should. I think my personal favorite is the Oscar nominated ""How Far I'll Go"" which also demonstrated Cravalho's beautiful voice. I think my only big problem with the movie was the fact that they were working in the fact that they wouldn't do specific clichés you see in Disney movies too many times. Now, I like it when a movie makes fun of a cliché, but ""Moana"" probably did this like over ten times or something. But, I still thought some of them were pretty funny nonetheless.""Moana"" is once again another great animated movie from Disney. It has everything that a great Disney animated musical should with some great animation, great songs, great stories and great characters. It may not be as good as ""Zootopia"", but it still really really good. It's a straight up wonderful movie. I really enjoyed it. All I can say to Disney is ""thank you""."
37,Moana,8,7 March 2017,"See the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me, And no one knows, how far it goes","They're called 'I Want' songs, moments where characters survey the world around them and declare their dissatisfaction in the only way they can, through music and lyric. Quasimodo with the best view in the world but no way to touch it, shunned for his appearance. Rapunzel prancing around the tower, longing to see the world outside. Ariel with her museum of human utensils, transfixed by a handsome prince on two legs. And now Moana has given us one of the trope's best with the heart-soaring ""How Far I'll Go"", which marries the lyrical genius of Lin-Manuel Miranda with a skipping, spirited Polynesian princess (she insists that she's heir to the chief, but as Maui points out whilst winking to the audience, ""If you wear a dress and have an animal sidekick, then you're a princess.""). Listening to the way in which the song transitions from its chorus to second verse with punchy, irregular beats makes it clear that this is isn't just shower business, it's a spoken plea to the ocean's call that tugs at her heart. The more cynical of the Disney veterans might be rolling their eyes at this point - these moments are just about obligatory for their animated features, and everyone loves to rally behind a character stuck in a rut, longing to seize their destiny with both hands. But the strength of Moana's 'I Want' moment isn't because it is an act of feminist rebellion ala Tangled or Brave, where the protagonists broke free of their cages, but a courageous bid to save the island and family that she treasures. The initiative lies with her, to go beyond the reef and seek a way to restore their home. Moana's opening reminds us of Hercules, beginning with epic myth and heroic battles shrouded in mystery, only to pull back humorously and wave away historical accuracy. A reaction shot of the captivated children tells us all we need to know the pick the main character - she's dead centre, with a pink flower in her hair and a big smile on her face. A following scene reiterates her calling, and doubles as a stunning tech demonstration at how far animators have come since Finding Nemo's watershed moment more than a decade ago. Moana, a bundle of toddler cuteness, waddles down to the beach, urging and protecting an equally tiny turtle hatchling, and then the water shifts out of her way like a loyal subject and wraps around like a living, breathing aquarium. What's especially impressive is how the underwater scenes shimmer under the sunlight and tremble along with the current, and how it reacts to Moana's curious touch, churning with bubbles and showering her with water droplets. The major studios have all but arrived at photorealism, and audiences will soon be spoiled for choice. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson looks and sounds the part of Maui, the demigod half-heartedly recruited on Moana's quest, and who sports the same broad, satisfied smiles. The voice acting musters all of the theatrical flair of his professional wrestling background - he flexes his action figure build with swagger, and in the endlessly catchy ""You're Welcome"", manages to take credit for things he probably had no business creating (the tides, the sun and the sky to start, but there is so much strutting bravado and confidence crammed into the song that you're likely to cheer along like Moana does). The lofty figure is best when he is at his most theatrical, which is why I came to admire him not for his soft interior, but his selfless actions in the climax. He charges the lava demon Te Ka with little hope of victory, and has his weapon charred and broken beyond repair, but instead of cowering, he bellows at the behemoth before him, and launches into a fierce haka. This is the traditional war cry of the Maori, a proclamation of strength and resolve, and in the face of certain defeat, Maui is choosing to sacrifice himself so that Moana can make right his own wrongs. It doesn't get more heroic than that. Another endearing feature of Maui is his animated tattoo counterpart, which serves not only as comic relief but also as an extension of his conscience. The tattoo works in the most universal type of comedy, pantomime, and the way in which he constantly scolds, guides and keeps a running score on Maui's naughtiness is refreshingly original. Along the way the pair battle a sassy, egotistical crab who hoards treasures and puts a face to all the nagging, doubting voices in the back of both Maui and Moana's minds. Tamatoa seeks to crush dreams and sneer at their aspirations; he's moulded his identity around shiny superficiality, and dismissed everything but the skin deep. Only later do they buck his accusations and yes, find their true self that lies deep inside. Watching Moana reminded me of another movie which focused on the plight of a Pacific Island community and their heroine - Niki Caro's Whale Rider. While their approaches might be a little different, what is remarkable is their authenticity. We're long past the red-skinned Indians of Peter Pan, or the causal hand-waving of history in Pocahontas, and Moana shows it in strides. Her journey offers a chance to prove herself, and through it she reaffirms the pride and strength she holds in her Polynesian ancestry, trusting in it to guide her along the way. Witness the reprise of her 'I Want' song, which initially poses an identity crisis. Then her grandmother dies, but not before passing on their cultural legacy, in the form of a radiant stingray which provides that extra push to sail beyond the reef. And as she rides the wave, she proclaims loudly and proudly: And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me/It's like the tide; always falling and rising/I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me/That come what may/I know the way/I am Moana!﻿"
38,Moana,10,2 January 2017,A beautiful movie but not exactly ground-breaking,"Another wonderful movie to add to the Disney classics. The film stars the daughter of a chief who sets of on journey to save her island. She journeys to find Maui, a mischievous block of tattooed muscles, I mean demigod, to help her save the world. They bond, fight, laugh and save the world with the help of the dumbest chicken you have ever met. The film doesn't exactly break boundaries, break from its typical story lines, explore mature themes or entertain adults the same way it can children. There are a lot animations that do this and Moana isn't one of them. I think this is the main reason people can't appreciate Moana. But WOW! It certainly leaves you feeling all chipper and sing-songy.It's an utterly beautiful, light hearted (with an occasional tear jerker) and humorous film. If you don't like Frozen, Big Hero 6 or Finding Dory please don't watch. This is a movie I will recommend to anyone and everyone because its definitely in Disneys top 10 out of what...like 200 films. For people who are complaining about plot and character dev. Please stop. Disney has worked to the bone to avoid cultural appropriation and misrepresentation whilst offering a visually stunning, humorous and adventurous plot. Sorry, if they didn't include that plot twist you were salivating for.Its get 10/10 instead 9/10 because I enjoyed this movie too much."
39,Moana,2,31 August 2017,Less Than Meets the Eye,Too many people seem to feel the need to love this movie for all the self-congratulatory ways in which this is supposed to be a politically satisfying Disney outing without noticing that it is one of the dullest Disney outings in a very long time.One notable song and very little genuine humour. Dramatic tension is almost non-existent even by Disney standards since it progresses in pretty much a straight line from beginning to end. A few minutes in and the middle and end of the movie are never in doubt.
40,Moana,3,29 August 2017,Another uninspiring musical animation movie that does not deserve the title: 'Disney Classic',"I don't care much if they reproduce the same story. If someone did care, than he would not watch new movies after watching 10 with identical story lines, but this film is far from good. Here are some of the reasonsFor example: there is too much ineffective comedy: The jokes were most of the times okay. A lot of them fall flat, but let's say that 70% of the jokes were effective and therefore I mean: 'Comedy without much competition on the rest of the story'. Other kinds of comedy however have little effect or they do not have effect at all. The pirates for example are walking coconut-things(We still do not know what they are). They were just added to be cute, that scene was not excited or memorable at all The giant crab later on in the film turned out to be a comedian and suddenly he started singing.. yeah, not really a 'demon from the deep' is he? Maui's tattoo's and the chicken are I guess most of the times effective, but they are overused, badly. All in all it is too obvious that comedy gets the first priority instead of story, but it should be the other way around! The songs are in general bad, same problem with 'Frozen': they are very uninspiring unlike 'Mulan' or 'The Lion King'(just to give some examples that did it right). In this case the songs are only meant as fillers and in the second half of the film they got really disturbing. The last song in which grandma showed up happen to be the most uninspiring song of the entire film and probably also the most horrible written(straight sentences in a song-form). It was also as cringing as the song by the ""demon"" crab in his magic cave. Anyway those songs where totally unnecessary and also indicates what the film's formula is: 'Making it child-friendly by adding many songs and removing any possible threads and adding lodes of comedy in order to satisfy as many different audiences as possible'. But it just won't work if even the characterization is bad. Maui is definitely the better character, but that is mainly because the comedy suits perfectly on his character; He just loves himself. Moana could be an interesting character, but they really made it hard to make her intriguing as a character and that is because she tries too little to help her own people. Instead she is most of the time too busy teasing the demigod and the rest of the time she sings. You would expect that she will go straight to the point, if the survival of her people and the balance of life is at stake here, but no.. It seems that it was just not important enough for her and that is why she drastically fails as a caring character. However the character development of Maui has also downsides: How did the gods make Maui into a demigod and who are those gods and how did Maui felt when that happened, because he was only a child and why didn't he abandoned his people after receiving those powers, because he got abandoned as well?! Emotional-involvement takes more than a brief discussion and that is why I also do not care much about Maui as well. There were also other things that were too brief. For example when Moana left the village while she sang(mother does not do anything to stop her) or the history that explains why Moana's father got so Protective. This is just like 'Frozen' when the parents die: It is simply too brief to create emotional-involvement.However the worst problem in this film happen to be the very questionable plot. Why does Moana has to search for Maui in the first place, if she can restore the heart of Te Fiti herself, because that will mean that everyone can, so why not the sea, since the sea can transport things(including the heart) right away? Maui even asked himself in the movie and he does have a point that still hasn't been answered. This makes also the entire idea of a 'chosen one' invalidated, because the ocean could solve this problem herself a long time ago, not with Maui's nor Moana's help, because the only thing you have to do is take that damn thing to that island and show it to that lava creature! There is no need for a demigod or a chosen one!! Apparently the ocean did nothing. Was it because it would have been too easy or did the ocean not know that Te Ka was Te Fiti herself? Who is to say Surprisingly the ocean was not very helpful at all along the way: Where was the ocean when the storm appeared, or when the pirates showed up, or when Te Ka attacked?! This film would have been better off without the whole concept of having a chosen one and without the sea as a guardian. However the questions don't stop there. Why does everyone in the village not hate Maui, he caused the extinction of life, so also their food, so 'hate' must be the natural response of the villagers. Instead they say: 'No, this poor fellow made a mistake, all he needs is to be convinced to put the heart back, just a few words will do the trick.' They probably thought that even 'hate' was too harmful for younger audiences to show.In conclusion: Moana is a bad movie. The comedy overwhelms the movie like too much salt on your omelet. There is very little character development. But above all the plot is a mess! I admit that I love the soundtracks, but it had to be ruined by the uninspiring songs. The visuals are good, but it can't hide the trash caused by almost everything of this film."
41,Moana,9,22 April 2017,Lost & Found,"Great film! Excellent weaving of story & song, physical & spiritual, individual & community. Favorite song: ""We Know the Way."" Catchy tune with powerful imagery and profound message. Spoiler Alert: Moana is lost and in a place of personal tension. She is prompted by her grandmother to enter into a cave to find. something. Who knows what?Moana is not geographically lost. She is lost in knowing who she is. Moana is trying to reconcile what she feels inside (passion for the ocean) with the expectations of her father and extended village family (to stay put on the island).Who of us isn't lost, just a little bit? From the high school kid who is asked, ""What are you going to study?"" to the retired person who is asked, ""What are you going to do now?""Aren't these two critical questions: who are we and what are we meant to do?The personal realization that Moana comes to at the end of the song is awesome, innocent and profound. At song's end, Moana shouts out, ""We are Voyagers!""She discovers who she is. She discovers who her people are. And she discovers that her passion and longing for the sea are aligned with her ancestral roots. Moana discovers that her own personal story is interwoven into a much richer communal and spiritual story. Moana finds herself. How cool if we could all find ourselves and what we were meant for!Overall Film: 9 out of 10."
42,Moana,,26 November 2016,Jarring,"It was going to sell...... Mooooaaaanaaa. Moan. Teardrops of pity. Bells and whistles clambering above and behind. It catches you. Moana is a movie of it's own, that speaks it's own language and reaps it's own wounds. Jarring. The ramifications of this movie, if you didn't know it already was, jellies from the distant aftertaste of 'Frozen' and 'Zootopia.' But this picture, if you didn't know it already was, is meant for Hawain culture, made for that specific statute of sensibility. So it's not that funny, but on a yacht at night, with the stars shining upon thee, without a whistle of wind, but the quiet rest of the open sea, and showing this film, if you didn't know it already was one, being shown on an outside projector, with a tropical drink in one hand and a bloody tissue in the other, then can this movie touch the jolts of my heart. What I am saying is this movie requires a journey for you to enjoy it instead of sitting their with a dried up full bag of large popcorn."
43,Moana,9,27 November 2016,A Reminder of all the Good there is in the World,"I find the concept of originality significant in most things in life. Everyone should be aware that this is somewhat of a fallacy in the world of movies as the basic principles of all stories have overlapping similarities. For something to be truly original, it needs to fundamentally change the basics of what has been established in storytelling.Moana does not reinvent storytelling as seldom few movies ever will. In fact, it hinges on the Disney formula that we all know. But what it does do is take all the greatest aspects of amazing or significant movies and brings them together to create a remarkably coherent, funny, sad, empathetic, and heartwarming experience. And by doing so, it taps into a sea of emotion.There were so many aspects of so many different films that I felt this movie drew from. Mulan, Pocahontas, The Emperor's New Groove, Hercules, The Little Mermaid, Zootopia, Finding Dory, Kubo and the Two Strings, Lilo & Stitch, Frozen (in a good way), even The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker although that's a game. All of these came to mind and seemed to inspire Moana in a way that I never expected or ever thought was possible, and that's just to name a few. I'm sure there's more that could easily be put on the list. And that's just part of what made it feel so special. That's not to say it didn't have its own originality either because it did. But by taking a little bit from a lot of different things, it turned it all into something it could call its own.It's not perfect as nothing is. But the flaws that it has diminish very little from the overall journey. So much so that I forgot what parts I disliked after the credits rolled.I'm sure people will disagree and feel that it was ""just another Disney story"" and that ""it's all been done a million times before"" because to be fair, it's somewhat true. It has all been done a million times and it IS just another Disney story. But what made it different to me was the fact that it remained enjoyable throughout almost the entirety of the film, never once felt like it lost its purpose, and kept me engaged with the desires and actions of the characters. It remained true to itself, and to its audience. And on top of all that, it pushed the boundaries yet again on how visually stunning animated movies have gotten year after year.I think the most important thing was how it tapped into a part of myself that has changed over the years due to the nature of growing up, and I hope it does the same for other people. Everyone who grew up watching animated movies at a young age, 2D or 3D, is getting older and usually hides a special part of themselves that existed when they were younger. Very few things have the power to bring us back to a time where we enjoyed so much and had so little to worry about. I don't mean this in a strictly nostalgic way although it's hard to phrase it otherwise. It was more the aspect of being reminded that there are still simplicities in life that we overlook, like something as simple as being alive at a time in history where watching an animated film that took thousands of hours to create by hundreds more people is possible. Even with money as the basis for most everything which is created, this did not feel like a cash-in just to capitalize on children, voice actors, or traditional nostalgia despite all that's been said. That's what made it feel genuinely remarkable.Moana was an experience that I won't forget."
44,Moana,5,25 December 2016,Poor representation of Polonesian culture,"I was born in Maui, lived there for 13 years and my sister is named Moana. Growing up I heard many legends about the Hawaiian hero Maui, many many legends and ANY of them would have made a better plot for this film.This is an example of an actual legend that has been Disneypulated into a pile of cliché plot twists in a tale that is nothing like any Hawaiian legend you have ever heard. The music is awful and more African than Polonesian. Auli'i Cravalho is the only singer with talent, and unfortunately for her the songwriter was super lame. Lame lame lame lame. I can't say lame enough when it comes to the music. They did not try.The antagonist was horribly underdeveloped. They just gave up I guess.Jemaine Clement's cameo was a disappointment, the best actor given the smallest role and a lame song to boot. Love him in Flight of the Concords, hate him in this movie.Worst of all was the use of the encouraging phrase, ""OK now go save the world!"" as if the writers are making fun of how cliché their own plot is.Lastly we come to Maui himself. It's obvious the references used for the character were not the images from actual Hawaiian legends. No, instead the reference was Bruddah Iz! Yes, the immensely obese and recently deceased Ukelele player. Sure, why not?! I can't say I have ever respected Dwayne the Rock as an actor either, Vin Diesel would have been way better.I conclude that this movie sucks Pele's cha cha."
45,Moana,5,1 December 2016,yet another in a long line of Disney princess movies,"I was... underwhelmed. Moana follows the standard Disney princess theme with less variation than I hoped. Disney is expert at manipulating your emotions. But Pixar is excellent at providing a story to go with it. This time, Disney won and Pixar lost. Not a lot of there there.What's odd is that Zootopia is just an amazing film. Zootopia crushes Moana on every level. Even the music. But then, Zootopia has a story to tell. All the difference in the world, that is.As an aside, Disney apparently put in a lot of work to find an ethnically authentic princess in Auli'i Cravalho. Yet, if I read the credits correctly, she shared credit with another lass for the songs. I'm not sure what that means in the world of animation, but it does leave one scratching one's head wondering what one just heard.Disney, go back and look at Zootopia again. More like that please!"
46,Moana,8,28 March 2017,The rock gives a solid performance,"Apologies for this, but ""it doesn't matter"" what you previously thought of Dwayne Johnson's acting talents (for the record, I always found his work entertaining), this one blows it all away. Visually, this film is stunning. Beautiful even. The animation of things like hair and water are simply astounding. Music is great, (I've got the soundtrack already) and the story is compelling. Thoroughly recommended."
47,Moana,1,9 August 2017,Michelle Obama saves the World,"You turn on CNN, you get fake news.You watch a recent Disney movie, you get PC ad nauseum. Yes, we get it: Women are not only smarter and kinder than men, they are also physically stronger. Gee, maybe the US can win a war if we only make our soldiers 100% female. Funny that none of the explorers that I learned about in grade school were female. After all, Moana, with no training or maps, is able to go everywhere, against all elements. Quint should have taken her along instead of Sheriff Brody.We do not elevate girls by making them out to be something that they are not an will never be. But Disney has an agenda and that will also never change."
48,Moana,10,1 April 2017,One of the better Disney movies,"This movie is so great, it has all the Disney feelings in it. The stupid humor and the most amazing animation. Would definitely watch this movie a whole lot of times again. This movie is also much much better than the Frozen movie from my point. I didn't really like the songs in frozen and thought they were overrated but the songs, all the music even, is so damn good!"
49,Moana,7,14 March 2017,Has it where it counts,"As cynical as I am about Disney movies, I freely admit that I liked ""Moana"" quite a bit. It wasn't exactly a challenge with Dwayne Johnson's involvement, but the elements that are usually a turn-off . . . weren't. The songs are good, the animation's beautiful, and the formulaic heroine with sidekicks really seem to work here.Cynically speaking, Moana is just another princess for the Mouse's stable. Having said that, you could do with a lot worse. She's got the spunk and strong personality to be a winning character, and she really makes this an enjoyable story.I could easily watch this again.7/10"
50,Moana,8,19 February 2017,Life of Moana.,"Finding Sing to have a catchy chorus,I asked a family friend about other recent animated films. Impressed by Disney's recent run,I was intrigued to hear high praise from this pal of their newest title,which led to me going to meet Moana. The plot:Told by her dad that she must not cross the ocean on her own due to tragic events that happened in his life, Moana Waialiki finds the ocean calling her to retrieve a mystical pounamu stone that demigod Maui had stolen from lava demon Te Kā. Seeing the fields and wildlife start to die out,Moana decides (and is secretly supported by grandmother Tala) that the stone must be returned to Te Kā in order to save the island. Joined by her pet rooster Heihei,Moana sets sail to discover Maui, Te Kā,and Moana's own coming of age adventure. View on the film:Nervous about just being a ""celeb voice"" flatly reading lines, Dwayne Johnson shows that he had nothing to worry about,as Johnson gives an utterly magnetic performance as Maui that connects with Johnson delivering one-liners with a speed he showed in his WWF days,which are joined by an unexpected dramatic thoughtfulness that Johnson carries Maui's care for Moana with. Making her debut performance, Auli'i Cravalho gives an enchanting performance as Moana,via Cravalho voice swimming with a Disney Princess passion to protect the island,with a feisty kick for Moana to take her own path to solve the crisis.Given the challenge of coming up with ""classic"" Disney songs, Lin- Manuel Miranda goes for ""talking songs"" where the characters explain what they are doing,which whilst breezy,do suffer from a lack of catchy lyrics. Keeping Moana on her own in a small boat for a good amount of the movie,the screenplay by co-writers/(with Jared Bush/ Pamela Ribon/ Aaron & Jordan Kandell) co-directors Ron Clements/Don Hall/ John Musker/ Chris Williams sail a gripping Road Movie wave,lit by crisp dialogue opening up Moana's self-discovery.Combining CGI with hand-drawn animation,the directors draw an utterly lush landscape,shimming with exquisite ""fresh"" water effects and smoothly designed,emotive faces. Jumping out of the water,the directors cleverly use the hand-drawn elements to give the movie a depth which makes the fiery action land with a bang,as the life of Moana is found in the ocean."
51,Moana,6,28 November 2016,Now if only we could have an Afghan Disney Princess..,"As far as animation goes, Moana is a tremendous achievement.As far as the Disney mass-hysteria goes, Moana breaks a few trends.As far as anything else goes -- you know, things that make a *movie*, Moana is an average motion-picture regurgitated from clichés too numerous to list and too hastily mashed together to have any kind of coherent effect.A princess wants to do things differently. (Opportunity for getting a bunch of adventurous-sounding rhymes stuck in teenage girls' head: Check. Now we have 2016's ""Let it Go"".)An authority figure wants her to stick to old ways.Another -- warmer -- authority figure believes in the princess.-Magic.The princess is thrust into situations she is definitely not prepared for. But well, her grandma *believes* in her.Meets a jock.Gets constantly in trouble and needs to be helped by the jock or (literally) by forces of nature.Moments of self-doubt.The princess' moment of self-doubt is resolved by a vision of her dead-grandma.The jock's moment of self-doubt is resolved by the princess.Bunch of evil things.Everything fails.The princess saves the day with a song.It's very rare that I end up sounding so cynical about a movie. I liked Zootopia. I'm okay with reusing certain plot techniques in a way that makes sense. But Moana focuses too much on character design, Polynesian ""authenticity"" and the must-break-the-glass-ceiling bandwagon that it kind of forgets that a movie is not only made by marketing and press, but also by its own innate qualities."
52,Moana,5,25 November 2016,Styx song doesn't work,"Love the Styx song, ""Come Sail Away"" but the song is clearly about aliens who come to the planet and we sail off with them into space. Maybe they should think next time about the perky music and the lyrics that may fit for the film. But no one will care when the toys and shirts and other junk stay around Walmart like ""Cars"" merchandise ten plus years from now. The song will outlast the movie. Where was the songwriting like what was kicked down for, ""Frozen""? It also seems that what separates this film from classics like ""Lion King"" and other epic Disney spectaculars is the lack of musical inspiration that set those films alone at the top. Is it that hard to come up with a new song or just pay the royalties and fish around for an old REO Speedwagon or Journey song?!"
53,Moana,9,23 November 2016,A Beautiful Addition to the Disney Library,"Moana is a fantastic movie. I have been looking forward to this movie even since I had heard of its release and I was not disappointed.Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, the team who brought us the Little Mermaid and Aladdin, Moana tells the tale of a young Polynesian woman named Moana who feels like she's being called to something out in the great unknown.Not only is the movie gorgeous to look at but the story is strong and the characters are great. Moana is fleshed out, given strengths and weaknesses. We also get to see her overcome her shortcomings and save the day. Moana is voiced by newcomer Auli'i Cravalho who not only did a good job with the acting but also with the singing. Her voice is fantastic! She teams up with Maui, a fallen demi-god, who is voiced by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and it's obvious the character was made just for him. While a bit of a braggart, he is very funny and likable.The songs in this movie are also very gorgeous, taking inspiration from Polynesian culture. The songs were written by Opetaia Foai, Mark Macina and Lin-Manuel Miranda of Hamilton fame. They fit with the setting perfectly and the songs are bursting with raw emotion. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Disney and loves mythology. I cannot recommend it enough."
54,Moana,10,10 February 2017,Disney better than expected,"I gave this 10. every movie that can give me goosebumps deserve 10 stars.. So two of my friends convinced me to watch this greatness of a Disney movie with them, i had only seen some posters with the movie, not even a trailer or hadn't heard anything about the movie.When i watched the movie, i got goosebumps of the music, something only Disney can do to me, i might be a 23 year old single man, but Disney can hit me right in the heart with these kinds of movies, it sorta feels like a childhood memory to watch the movie, even though it couldn't be one. because it's new. I also happens to fall in love with the main protagonist, like i did with frozen, Disney princess are my dream, i'll never meet anyone like Anna or Moana, but i can dream. This movie kinda needed a really sad moment to be a 100% Disney movie, but it works without it. I will never get to old to watch Disney movies... This hit me right in the feels with the music.. :D This movie is great you should watch it!"
55,Moana,2,15 January 2017,My prejudices included,"I want to upfront admit that my prejudices are included in my views of Moana. First the Italian film of the same name from the last decade is a fave of mine. The legs, the breasts, the long hair and of course the realness ah I can smell the wonderful enchantress. Second like many of my buds I too am a lover of the famous porn star whether it is Moana's straight sex scenes, the more exotic ones with the dwarfs or the group action we love Moana. Indeed when we got together this weekend to have some brew and watch some porn on the big screen there was no doubt which Moana real red blooded men prefer. With that said, I took my brat and bratess to watch Disney's Moana and was somewhat bored. I wonder if my little man will grow up a real man's man or become a wussy Disney fan, but he watched it and did it quietly. My princess thought it wasn't good like Frozen so keep that in mind. As for different cultures and stuff I am no expert and in the new America that belongs to President Donald Trump who friggin cares(supposedly the spirit of her grandmother appearing and her falling down the hole have cultural meaning), but fact remains that the name Moana is not an attractive one as if someone wants to hear a woman moan anywhere. Be super thin, have long hair and cook and all is alright. Be your own woman and be a feminist lamestream fan and we got issues. Anwyay, it is available at your local multiplex for $10 per adult or $7 for little ones."
56,Moana,5,24 November 2016,Disappointing *possible spoiler?*,"One of the magical qualities of a Disney cartoon movie is the romance between its characters.I grew up idealizing Princess Aurora, Belle, Jasmine, Ariel etc... all of these women were strong and independent. They didn't need a man either, but there was always tasteful romance set up in one way. Our world is a horrible place sometimes. Movies are suppose to help us escape the reality of the world and take us to mythical places. They are the thing of dreams that carry us to what might be possible. With Moana Disney cut romance out all together. So what, now countless of our daughters are going to grow up thinking that they don't need a man at all...that they can be harry lonely cat people with no children of their own because they don't need a man? The movie was funny. I liked the character herself, but now I'm not so sure I want my daughter to go to the next Disney movie. I want her to have fairy tales too."
57,Moana,9,25 November 2016,Tremendous Movie,"Just saw Moana today and was completely blown away. Moana is the story of a princess of a Polynesian island paradise who senses that something is going wrong. Turns out the problem is that the mischievous demigod Maui has stolen the ""heart,"" a jewel, from a neighboring island and this has cast a curse over her whole island society. The ocean chooses her to make a perilous journey across the sea to find Maui and get him to return the jewel and restore prosperity to her island.Moana is a startling film on a bunch of levels. The animation is not only magically crafted, it also has a great amount of variety and stunning beauty--no Disney film has ever fallen in love with its setting as much as this one. Moana also has an excellent musical score that pays great homage to the culture that it depicts with use of native instruments and choral stylistic elements. Moana has wonderful characters--Moana and Maui develop a terrific (non- romantic) relationship, as Moana helps Maui toward redemption from his terrible mistake and Maui turns her into a master voyager--in other words, helps her find her full potential as a human being.There is quite simply nothing to dislike about this movie--Disney at its absolute best."
58,Moana,7,23 January 2017,Moana (2016),"If you know me well enough you would know that I'm very critical of animated films. I think a lot of them miss the mark and can only remain interesting for children. A good animated feature is inclusive of a widespread audience and can remain smart and engaging will offering fun and crafty animation. Moana is not something I was looking forward to, as on paper it didn't look like it was going to leave much of an impression on me. It's safe to say that I'm surprised that this film was honestly pretty good.The first thing that I think deserves praise is the music. Nearly every song is excellent, catchy, and just so full of life. It's hard not to sing along to the music. This isn't exactly something I can say for a lot of animated films. The more technical aspect of the film is great. The colors are very vibrant and the animation is vivid and expansive (just like the vast ocean the heroes sail). Some of the action is eye-popping and very striking, especially the battle with the lava demon, Te Ka. Auli'i Cravalho is a relative newcomer who does a very good job of bringing Moana to life. She will probably have many more voice acting roles in the future.I also think the film is a good look into a culture that many people won't be familiar with. I've noticed that Disney is really trying to focus on some minority groups in the past few years and this is perfectly good for fresh inspiration. In the case of Moana, this provided for an interesting and unfamiliar setting and story, which adds to the films overall appeal. I'm well aware of the cultural criticisms this film received for the portrayal of Maui and the lack of heroine goddesses. However, its good to leave some criticisms at the door. If you look hard enough a criticism can be found for anything and its unnecessary for a film that means well.The film has its typical Disney clichés. You have the ""chosen"" hero who is unsure of themselves. You have the relationship with a buddy that is at first strained but then leads to the characters liking each other. There is a falling out and reunion with the hero discovering their ability. The film treads familiar Disney ground. Its not a terrible thing and kids won't really give a damn about it. Its not a flawless film, at its core its a familiar formula but I think the cultural aspect and imaginative visuals put a good balance.I think Kubo and the Two Strings was far and away the best animated film of the year and proved why Laika are ahead of the curve. I'd say Moana is better than some of its animated counterparts in the year, such as Zootopia and Finding Dory. I still long for the days of 90s Disney films but this effort shows that they are still trying at least. If for nothing else, sit back and enjoy the excellent music and visuals in the film.7.5/10"
59,Moana,2,21 March 2017,Cliché,Same old Disney formula And what's worse I don't like The Rock. Not only he is not an actor and can't act his way out of a high school cafeteria he is also very crude and ugly and that voice... aarrrgh get some culture Moana is nonsense and spiritually superficial Same old Disney formula And what's worse I don't like The Rock. Not only he is not an actor and can't act his way out of a high school cafeteria he is also very crude and ugly and that voice... aarrrgh get some culture Moana is nonsense and spiritually superficial
60,Moana,5,16 December 2016,Hawaiian Chief or New Zealand Chief?,Dwayne Johnson was the reason I chose to watch this movie but I was really disappointed Disney didn't use a Hawaiian actor to play Chief Tui. The New Zealand accent was very out of place. And the entire village doesn't go beyond the reef because of the Chief's fear? Really? The kid has to man up because of the wimpy parent. That seems to be Disney's core message in a good deal of their shows.Most-likely no Hawaiian actor wanted to play a wuss in the role of Chief. Really bad form Disney!I really wanted to like this movie but this was a fail on Disney's part.
61,Moana,10,15 April 2017,I loved it!,"I really appreciated the tribal basis of this animation. I think they should make more of this type of animation and less Disney Princess based ones. Moana was a very well represented cultural animation. I loved the fact that their facial features and body structure were not all lean and straight or small nosed. It brings a kind if realness that the rest of us can relate to. I loved the plot as well so much, there was a point I actually got chills all over. I can't remember how many times I've re-watched it."
62,Moana,10,10 April 2017,Another Masterpiece by Disney!!,"In Ancient Polynesia, when a terrible curse incurred by the Demigod Maui reaches an impetuous Chieftain's daughter's island, she answers the Ocean's call to seek out the Demigod to set things right. Moana stars Auli'i Cravalho as Moana and Dwayne Johnson as Maui and it's easily one of the best animated films from 2016 next to Kubo and the Two Strings, the animation is beautiful, the songs that both Cravalho and Johnson sing threw out the movie were amazing as for the rest of the cast they also steal the show with the best example being the little chicken Heihei played by Alan Tudyk (Rogue One) also another character that i really liked was the little Pig. So overall there's nothing more to say about this film it was beautiful, it sounded beautiful and it looked beautiful and maybe who knows we might get a Moana 2? We'll see but until then i recommend you to see it. (A+)"
63,Moana,10,8 April 2017,Amazing ocean!,"Palms, sand, warm ocean water, fragrant coconuts, colorful outfits, traditional dances and mythology of the peoples of Polynesia. All grown on the sheen of the scales ""Little Mermaid"" (1989), the magic of ""Aladdin"" (1992) and the legends of ""Hercules"" (1997) and all growing up on the phone call ""Frozen"" (2013) and the ""Zootopia"" (2016) Will conquer the joint creativity of the beloved creators of 2016 called ""Moana"".With the support of a whole team of anthropologists, teachers, scientists, linguists, cultural experts and navigation specialists, the Disney creative union tells an amazing story based on the culture of the Polynesian people unknown outside the Pacific. In the center of the story is Princess Moana, the daughter of a tribal leader from the fictitious island of Motunui, which embodies thousands of Polynesian islands. She is chosen by the ocean to save her world and people from the ancient spell and death. And her heroic mission is fun, successful and easy, until the culprit of all ills, the demigod Maui, interferes with her. Well, or just a two-hundred-year-old offended man.Magic and brightness, detailing and technique, concreteness and intelligibility. All the age categories are captivated by that fantasy, childish spontaneity and purity, which is hidden in the rationality of hidden images and meanings from adult directors: the dumb crab is full of shine, the nature that has become offended by consumers-people, the powerful, but infantile demigod, and the most Ordinary girl as a standard of overcoming fears and courage to swim against the current. However, not so much the iridescent childishness in the hearts of the creators makes the cartoon exciting and deep, how much an adult sense of proportion in their heads.The disobedience of parental care and the pursuit of a dream are not in conflict, but in harmony with love and respect for the feelings of their ancestors and especially the advice of a wonderful grandmother. The acquired independence, wisdom, friendship and courage accompany the basic message - the preservation of nature. Computer graphics unobtrusively replaced by futuristic drawings in the good traditions of folk art of Polynesia. And when the next song would be superfluous even for the genre of the musical (which complements comedy, adventure and fantasy), one of the characters honestly and openly says, as if reading the viewer's thoughts: ""If you start singing, I will definitely vomit!"" For the company with such subtle irony, the natural hindrance of the unruly curly hair of the heroes, the play with the water and the awkwardness of Maui are simply amusing. The abundance of musical motifs and variety of songs are amazing. And admires the non triviality of the find in the form of hand-drawn tattoos: in general and mini-Maui in particular. Being located on the heart and moving all over the body of the carrier, he, like the conscience of his possessor, discourages that from stupidity, cowardice and betrayal.Following the awards of the British Academy, Golden Globe and Oscar in 2017, Moana did not become the best animated film, giving way to the ""Zootopia"". However, for the viewer, it will definitely become a classic and synonymous with kindness, purity, courage and dreams for many years to come. Because this is the perfect cartoon of the perfect graphics, ideal characters, story, sound, music and send. The only negative, which for someone even a plus: after viewing everyone wants to make a tattoo.10 of 10"
64,Moana,6,9 December 2016,Formulated,"This movie was...pretty good. Its not worthy of an 8.2 average user rating (as of the time of writing this review) though. I don't wanna spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet so I won't go into much detail.First, let me say I don't hate this movie. On a technical level this film is truly remarkable. The animation is gorgeous and some aspects of it are even photorealistic. Dwayne Johnson's voice fits Maui's character very well, and all the other voice actors were good too. Some ideas were really cool like how the water is a character and Maui's tattoos can tell stories. Some of the songs weren't bad, either. Except for that obvious ""Let It Go"" ripoff.My big problem with the movie is its story. Its way too formulaic. I could predict pretty much every major plot point as the film unfolded. If you've ever seen a Disney movie, you know what's going to happen. A character loses something dear to them but it is conveniently restored later. An antagonist has a quirky song number that isn't as catchy or majestic as ones sung by the main characters. There's the quirky sidekick that serves no purpose to the plot besides being useful in one brief moment of one scene. Every character with some flawed personality trait is perfectly resolved. At one point I thought to myself ""we're overdue for a musical number, aren't we?"" and literally 10 seconds after I thought that, a musical number started. I could go on about various aspects that Yes, anyone who's seen the movie will tell you its somewhat self-aware, but recognizing the issue does not change the fact that it still suffers from it. If you wanna see it, feel free to, but don't expect anyone over age 12 to have their mind blown. Yes the animation is amazing and the Polynesian setting is unique for Disney, but the story is one we've seen dozens of times before. 6.5/10"
65,Moana,9,26 December 2016,A film that fills the heart and makes eyes bright,"Polynesian adventure that takes something from all Disney classics but is able to innovate through characters, particularly the villain. Moana is reminiscent of the environmentalist soul of Ghibli Studio, with its interest in popular Asian mythology and natural spirits. Music is awesome and the moral about the importance of taking responsibility is anything but stale. The only real weakness of the movie is a certain repetitiveness in the middle part, but the breathtaking of the scenarios makes it equally enjoyable. Ultimately, a fun and emotional film, visually stunning, which fills the heart and makes eyes bright. Super recommended."
66,Moana,9,19 December 2016,Another Lively & Gorgeous Entry for Disney's Revival Era,"I can't remember a better year for animation than 2016. Moana adds to this year's trend of progressing the limits of animation while giving stories for both children and adults.Continuing the Disney Revival era of animation, Moana provides endless charm with its two leads, and an opportunity for audiences to see a much different and diverse story portrayed on screen. Not a true musical per-say, but Moana contains some of the catchiest, heartfelt, and downright colorful musical numbers of the year. Thanks to help from Lin-Manuel Miranda, this soundtrack is bound to top the charts and awards season.Luckily, it isn't just the songs that will stick with you long after the theater, gorgeous animation and a heart-warming story flood Disney's latest hit. The filmmakers notably took plenty of time in researching the lives and culture of those living in the South Pacific, and it showed. Even if there were liberties taken, I loved learning about these people and how they lived their lives. It's a timeless adventure story that doesn't rely on pop culture references or screwball humor, instead, its layered lore and appealing leads pave the way for a glorious experience.What also struck me was the immense detail that went into making Moana. Everything from Maui's tattoos to the lively ocean, this may be the most beautiful animated film to date. Ironically, it will be up against Kubo & the Two Strings come awards season, and they both share many qualities. Both have groundbreaking animation, fantastical and mythological characters, and a coming of age story of a youth growing into a leader.I think the only weaknesses were with the pacing and its villain. Not unlike Frozen in that the antagonistic elements aren't really present until the third act. It's not an overwhelming negative considering the film does just fine without a true villain, but the absence is definitely felt at times. The middle act also is a little slow, and I wasn't a big fan of one particular character introduced about halfway through, but the third act was truly remarkable.So even though I thought having The Rock sing or casting a completely unknown in the title role was a risk, it couldn't have turned out better for Disney's next chapter in their revival. Plenty of well- strung songs, detailed animation, and a thoughtfully important story makes Moana one of the best animated movies in quite some time, and certainly of 2016.+Brilliant songs+Detailed animation+Heart-warming story+Different & diverse Disney film-Middle act slows9.3/10"
67,Moana,8,18 December 2016,fun music and compelling characters,"Moana is told the story of Maui (Dwayne Johnson) by her Gramma Tala. Maui is the warrior demigod who has a magical fishing hook which allows him to change shape. He had stolen the goddess Te Fiti's heart but he's attacked by the volcano demon Te Kā. He lost the heart and his hook. A darkness descended on the world. The people stopped exploring and the fish are disappearing. Moana's father Chief Tui forbids her from going beyond the reefs. Moana is given the heart by the sea and she disobeys her father to go exploring. She finds Maui and together, they battle coconut pirates and Te Kā to return the heart to Te Fiti.There is a lot going for this movie. The animation is beautiful. The characters are compelling. There is a bit humor and an interesting adventure. Lin-Manuel Miranda adds his Broadway musical skills to create a few catchy tunes. It does follow the successful recent Disney formula of an empowered young girls overcoming dire odds and low sexist expectations. The filmmakers seem to know the expectations and even Moana rebels against being called a princess. The formula may be familiar but the setting is new. Overall, this simply works."
68,Moana,5,14 December 2016,Too Mainstream to Be Memorable,"Apparently, a lot of effort HAS gone into this animation of Polynesian folklore and it has all the elements kids these days have come to expect from Disney movies: 3D animation, wide-eyed characters bumbling around or talking like hip kids are 'supposed' to talk, the hero and his/her pet, and an adventure that makes use of the aforementioned 3D animation because its clear the character design isn't! So what's wrong with it?Well, nothing you can put your finger on right away. I've enjoyed old Disney flicks and recent ones equally - Inside Out being one of the most recent that I've liked, and I've got to say, this movie was a bit boring. That's surprising considering how the characters all seem to run about and pull faces, but then again that's the DUMB way to captivate your audience. The smart way is to establish an atmosphere that gives the story it's own identity, and this movie doesn't do that.The first few minutes with Moana growing up in the village reminded me of Pocahontas, and I couldn't help but feel how everything in THAT particular movie roped me in to the world the story was trying to create, and did so very well. The music, the sound effects, the art, the way the characters spoke, everything BREATHED life into the story of the Native Americans, gave the story identity, and made it incredibly, incredibly enticing. I've heard Disney's been trying to diversify its repertoire of animated films, but with Moana, it hasn't succeeded. There was no real charm or identity breathed into the Polynesian characters. Our heroine's dialogue and delivery matches that of a teenager in 2016, not of the era she's supposed to live in. With Moana, Disney is just going through the motions to try to sell something colorful and ""diverse"", and looking at general reception, it has succeeded. I however, am not convinced."
69,Moana,9,1 December 2016,"""Moana"" is one of the best animated movies of 2016!","""Moana"" is the Polynesian word for ""ocean"". And that's only the beginning of the cultural and historical connections between Polynesia and Walt Disney Animation Studios' ""Moana"" (PG, 1:43). After a lengthy, worldwide talent search, the job of voicing the title character went to Hawaiian native Auli'i Cravalho, who then became, at the age of 14, the youngest person ever to voice a Disney princess character. Her co-star, Dwayne Johnson, also of Polynesian (Samoan) descent, plays a character based on a major figure of the same name from Polynesian legend. Cravalho and Johnson are joined by Troy Polamalu, the former NFL Pro Bowl player, who also has Samoan ancestry and voiced one of the villagers. Besides casting these and other actors of Polynesian blood, Disney developed this movie by sending co-directors Ron Clements and John Musker on tours of the South Pacific in order to make sure the film accurately and respectfully portrayed the look and culture of Polynesia. Of course, this is all within the context of a Disney animated feature film which, in my opinion, has turned out to be the studio's best in years.Moana Waialiki (Cravalho) is the daughter of the chief of a small topical island called Motunui. She grew up hearing legends about the origins of her world and the water which surrounds it and always felt drawn to the ocean. It's an attraction that her father, Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison), won't allow her to indulge, fearing for her safety, while Moana's Gramma Tala (Rachel House) urges her to be who she is meant to be. When a mysterious plague starts killing the fish and vegetation on which her people depend, Moana feels compelled to follow the example of her wayfinding ancestors and make a journey across the ocean in search of a legendary remedy  and she is convinced that the ocean has chosen her.Moana is sailing off in search of the legendary shape-shifting demigod, Maui (Johnson), who helped create this world by pulling the islands up out of the ocean with his large, magical fishhook and by controlling the son to lengthen the day. But he also stole a beautiful green gem stone  the heart of the island goddess, Te Fiti. The lava demon, Te Ka, then attacked Maui, causing him to lose the stone, as well as his fishhook and end up stranded on a remote island for 1,000 years. When Moana lands there, Maui believes the gods have sent him the boat to end his exile. Maui is a very arrogant, self-assured demigod and has no interest in helping this young island girl to save the world from the plague  which he caused.Convincing Maui to travel with her to put back Te Fiti's heart (which the ocean itself has graciously but insistently brought back up) is only the first of Moana's challenges with Maui at her side. Moana knows nothing about seafaring, so Maui has to teach her. So Maui can utilize all his powers, Moana has to help him retrieve his magic fishhook, a task that involves making it through some place called the Realm of the Monsters. Then they have to fend off an attack from cute, but nasty coconut pirates which look and act like a cross between the Minions from the ""Despicable Me"" movies and Immortan Joe's army in ""Mad Max: Fury Road""  on the high seas. If our heroes survive all that (and crossing the ocean on a glorified raft), there's the issue of getting past Te Ka so they can put back Te Fiti's heart. Simple, right? ""Moana"" is a highly entertaining and edifying journey. Although the character of Moana and her mission are Disney inventions, the heart of the story is the rich and exotic culture of the Polynesian people of the South Sea islands. Moana is a tough and determined but vulnerable and adorable combination of previous Disney heroines like Merida from ""Brave"", Ariel from ""The Little Mermaid"", Rapunzel from ""Tangled"", Anna from ""Frozen"" and Mulan from ""Mulan"". (However, the adventure that accompanies Moana's mission and the character of Maui will likely make this movie popular with the boys too.) Of course, a Disney princess (or, ""Chief's daughter"" as Moana prefers) needs a sidekick and she has a bug-eyed, none-too-bright pet rooster named Heihei for company and substantial comic relief.The film features computer animation, mainly to enhance the look of the ocean on screen (the water  and the entire film  are gorgeous!), but there are also some hand-drawn images nested within the movie  in the form of Maui's tattoos, which move on their own, illustrating scenes from his life and giving him advice. Then there's the wonderful original music  much of it by none other than ""Hamilton"" auteur Lin-Manuel Miranda (hired for this job even before his revolutionary musical take on American history took Broadway by storm)  and Dwayne Johnson sings some of Miranda's composition! Last but not least, the film is bookended by the clever animated short ""Inner Workings""  and a very funny post-credits shout-out to the directors' 1989 film ""The Little Mermaid"". ""Moana"" is not to be missed! ""A"""
70,Moana,5,14 March 2017,Chicken Discrimination,"Here's my two-cents and a collection of nitpicks. First and foremost, I didn't go into this movie knowing it was a musical. When the first musical song chords hit, I knew I was going to be in for a long droll of a film. Every song in this film is forgettable. There weren't enough memorable or catchy phrases in the choruses of the songs to hold onto, and the melodies were lackluster at best with basic chord progressions to invoke a feeling of false excitement in the average viewer. I will say, though, that I enjoyed the mythology and lore behind the movie, and since ""Moana"" isn't set in the real world, I could find myself getting invested into the adventures Maui had. That was one reason I didn't dock the movie's rating as much as I would've. Another reason was because I liked the design of the Kakamoras' ship(s). The little contraptions that split the ship into multiple parts and the consideration of tying the drummers onto ropes as they bounced up and down were pretty thoughtful. One other reason I didn't dock the rating was because Moana's stupid non-aging pet pig didn't come on the voyage. Thank. Freaking. Goodness. Pigs grow up rather quickly. Even if it was a pygmy pig, it shouldn't have been a dwarf the entire time. Speaking of animal sidekicks, the main reason I didn't like this movie was because of the portrayal of Heihei, the literally retarded chicken. I've worked with chickens and kids with moderate to severe mental and physical disabilities (yes, I've worked with handicapped chickens), and the way Heihei is portrayed is insulting to all of the mentally disabled. It's not funny when Heihei doesn't do something you'd expect a chicken to do. It's not funny when they give it eyeballs the size of golfballs. It's not funny when they don't depict any aging of Heihei, even as Moana grows up, similarly to the pig, because the chicken's feathers never appear to molt or bleach in the sun. Or maybe it's not funny because I have a stubborn sense of humor and take offense to movies that depict my favorite farm animal in a poor light. ""Ha ha! It's funny because the chicken looks ugly and is dumb!"" He didn't have any redeemable qualities; he was just there to hold the kids' attention because the rest of the movie was so boring.From the very beginning of the movie, the characters were out of touch with reality. Kids don't cry because they sense impending doom based on possible mythology. They care about getting their snack fix and making boom-booms in their pants than the inevitable demise that is their deaths. Infant Moana not being scared of death isn't a sign of courage; it's a sign of naive curiosity. A lot of the reactions in this movie bring up several questions, too. Why would the village suddenly consider they were voyagers in the past just because Moana said so? Why wouldn't they do something to ensure that their lives would be preserved instead of simply take the word of their chief--unless they were ruled under supreme dictatorship? How come it was okay to listen to the slightly cooky granny just because she was eccentric? You don't do that with the schizophrenic, do you? Do you stop on the street and listen to what a babbling homeless man on drugs has to say and take it seriously? No. The ocean's character isn't clear in this movie. This isn't water-bending like in the ""Avatar"" show, and it's not telepathic waves from Te Fiti. It's its own thing. So, yeah, why did it choose Moana? Not only that, its motivations are inconsistent since sometimes it helps Moana, sometimes it doesn't. Maybe it's an allusion to how the ocean can be both benevolent and relentless, but as a kids' movie with weak concrete evidence, I'm going to say it's because the writers were lazy. Maui's tattoos also freaked me out because while their origins are cool, the way Maui's sprite animates and reflects his conscious (?) makes me wonder if the sprite is a shoulder angel type of character or his inner thoughts worming through his skin. It wasn't really funny, and it would have been better if we could have seen some character development between Moana and Maui instead of having the tattoos doing the projection. I will say: one of my few appreciations for the film is how there wasn't any hint of romance or platonic intimacy between Moana and Maui. It isn't like ""Frozen"" where you have a feeling something's happening between Kristoff and Anna, and it isn't like ""Pacific Rim"" where Raleigh and Mako were forced to work together and maybe chemistry would ignite between them. Moana and Maui were their own people. They weren't terribly interesting people with good chemistry, but they worked off each other in ways that didn't have me any more annoyed than I was bored with the setup. Overall, this is an average movie that I went into with high expectations from the initial concept design, but the songs, the offensive nature of pandering to kids, and the dull transition of plot made this a very forgettable experience. I can't even quote a full sentence from this film. That's how bad it was. Oh, and closing thoughts: that was a desperate move for jokes trying to pull ""The Little Mermaid"" into the post-credits."
71,Moana,,26 December 2016,Moana,"Watched Moana with family the Christmas long weekend. The only Moana I know is one I used to have a certain kind of affair with. It was fun poking her (and I wasn't the only one I don't mind telling you). The reason I tell you this is I went into the film with a certain expectation that you may not have (unless you live in this town).Anyway so Moana is a Hawaiian/Islander name which I guess I already kinda knew but wasn't sure. Anyway, you will see pacific customs and a rebel princess and she has some dark moments and some wisdom and of course everything will turn out alright. The Disney script is pretty much known.I guess children would like it up until a certain age but more so if you have girls obviously. The graphics keep getting better and better and there is the magic song writing of Disney which was already fully developed in Frozen.But at a certain age even if your girls may be too old now for this."
72,Moana,8,21 February 2017,"Great visuals, great music.","Moana, while most certainly a cookie-cutter Disney movie, stood out among others with excellent music and even better visuals. The fanciful story follows a young girl, Moana, on her quest to save her island from the mysterious force that is killing all vegetation. The characters in this story suffer from subpar characterization, but as far as children's movies are concerned, this was not unforgivable. The music in this film will, in my mind, be ranked up there with the music found in ""Frozen""- unforgettable and instant classics. In addition, the visuals in this film were absolutely astounding. I found myself caught up in the incredible detail with that animators put into everything. All in all, while the rebellion of the young girl was certainly typical of Disney (and highly irritating for myself), I found the plot to be further from where the company usually ventures, and I found the film entirely refreshing."
73,Moana,7,17 February 2017,Tangled joins Kung Fu Panda to save the environment,"There's a theory that in this world there is only a handful of truly original stories, first told ages ago, and the rest is just a combination and a rehash of those. Well, I'm not sure about the whole entirety, but the story of Moana definitely sounds kinda familiar. ""Sounds"" being not just metaphorical, hehehe.In case you want your details and explanations dry, it's a story of two persons who join forces to overcome a greater evil, discovering their true selves along the way. Sounds indeed familiar. Right, because every other story out there, from Luke Skywalker to Jason Bourne, is about fighting evil and self-discovery. But is it a curse or a blessing in disguise? After all, being familiar doesn't necessarily mean being boring. And it's the details of the particular implementation that make all the difference.Speaking of details, it's simply impossible not to fall in love with Moana, that's how beautifully this film is drawn. The lush colors, the beautiful landscapes and the sea, the adorable characters - everything here is an eye candy. Add some decent (albeit slightly lacking variety) singing and a cute and vigorous young heroine - and you've gotten yourself another Tangled, this time without the castle and blonde hair but with tropical islands and catamarans to compensate for it.But while this film is undoubtedly a joy to watch, it falls just a little short of becoming a real hit. Probably because, unlike his latest predecessors, it didn't bring into the genre anything fresh. Tangled was the first really successful animated musical in decades. Frozen built on that success and redeveloped the world of fairy tales into a place where girls can actually take the lead. And while Moana has all the strong points of its older sisters, giving us just that is not entirely satisfying. Which doesn't mean that you won't have fun watching it, but the chances that Moana will win a permanent spot in your heart and memory are fairly slim."
74,Moana,6,7 August 2017,Mocking the craft does not excuse following it.,"MOANA - 2016Directed by Ron Clements and John MuskerStarring Auli'i Cravalho and Dwayne JohnsonPlot Overview: ​When darkness begins to envelope her land, next in line to be chief, Moana(Auli'i Cravalho), rebels her father's wishes and sets sail across the ocean to awake Demi-God, Maui(Dwayne Johnson) and return the heart of Te Fiti to where it was stolen from.I've heard people call this movie one of the best Disney animated movies and while it is certainly good, I personally think it's one of the weaker entries to the new Renaissance. Again, it is certainly good and it contains some qualities which I really like and hope are expanded upon but it's just not up to the quality of Zootopia, Wreck it Ralph, Big Hero 6 or - heck - even Frozen, as much as I've grown a distinct distaste for that film. Let me break my disappointment with this film down, step by step.Firstly, the plot. As much as I really like the idea of mocking common Disney tropes, the film still follows them tropes and that makes the 'self aware' statement feel redundant. I'm all up for a new self- aware Disney but commit to change, don't dip your toes in the water. Even after that, the plot is pretty clichéd and weak. I think calling it a buddy adventure film is a good place to start but it just feels so disjointed and so much of it feels like filler. And I absolutely despise the ending. It is 100% a cop out and they clearly just wanted to rap it up quickly.Character and voice acting. Auli'i Cravalho was good as Moana and she can definitely sing. Moana is a very strong contender for Disney princesses. She is independent, kinda interesting and has a strong will; she is a very solid character and I am happy with her overall arc.I love Dwayne Johnson. He may not be a great actor but he sure is likable and insanely charismatic. He will be king of the world some day but, for the love of God, he cannot sing. He CAN NOT SING! As a voice actor: sure he was passable. As a singer: he is the Antichrist. Anyway, as a character, Mauii was a completely average Disney sidekick. He seems to be imitating(to a certain degree) Robin Williams' iconic genie and I'll say it here and now, he doesn't live up to him.The villains in the movie were very weak. Some people argue that there aren't any but I disagree. The bandit things were certainly enemies(with no explained motivation mind you) and the Fire God was a villain for a short time. Both of these characters were uninteresting and boring.Every Disney princess has a sidekick, yes? Yes. And I will happily say, Moana has possibly one of the worst. Hei Hei is such a useless, pointless joke of a sidekick that I cannot believe he was green-lit. His mere existence is a joke and that is REALLY annoying. Put thought into your sidekicks Disney!The animation was stunning. It looked amazing and I really commend the animation department. We have water effects nearly on par with 'The Good Dinosaur' and really creative and inventive character design and visuals. The cinematography and editing were both pretty good.I laughed at quite a few jokes but nothing on par with Aladdin or whatnot. The emotional payoff with her grandma was very touching and emotional and I am genuinely impressed with how they handled it.As for music, I like the song 'How Far I'll Go' but they use it THREE times and that just makes the song hard to listen to. I hate every other song in the music, especially Johnson's and that god damn crab(screw that crab!).In conclusion, I recommend this movie but I definitely think it is one of the weaker entries to the new Renaissance. You should see it but I wouldn't expect cinematic gold. I'll rate Moana 6 Crab Solos out of 10!"
75,Moana,9,19 May 2017,Great Disney Film,"Moana was a great Disney film that can be enjoyed by the entire family. It has the similar Disney plot of a main character journeying off to achieve a un-realistic task similar to ""Frozen"". The music throughout was great and went along with the story just fine. The two main characters Moana, and Maui ( Dwayne Johnson) join together to find ""The heart of Te Fiti"". First the two seemed to be incompatible, eventually forming a friendship while trying to accomplish the same task. Dwayne Johnson shows the normal friendly, yet stern attitude throughout the film. The characters seem fit for the time period, and cultural background they are foreshadowing. Auli'i Cravalho who sings her characters own part sings great throughout the show. Overall a great show."
76,Moana,9,12 April 2017,Beautiful and inspiring movie,"Since the Jungle book I have not feel like this by watching an animated movie. It is a beautiful story full of magic, culture and spirituality. It is a motivational movie for self trust and awareness for nature and the importance of family. The soundtrack is awesome and catchy. It made me laugh and cry. Definitely worth to see for people of all ages."
77,Moana,6,6 April 2017,Uninspriring,"Weak songs and bad singers are the basis of this uninspiring movie. The theme and visuals are great and could have been the ingredients for another top Disney animation. But it's opposed by a weak story, boring jokes and did i already mention bad singing and songs? We don't see the actors, just hear them. Why would you ever pick the rock as a singer??? Or a 1 out of a dozen singer as Auli'i Cravalho. And please turn off that %#%$ vo-coder!!! That's only meant for kids that can't sing, like the cast you've picked.Characters are too predictable too. This time a retard chicken as funny sidekick. Disney, stick with your guns, be yourself and be original again. Don't follow the retarded pop culture of today but set it ..."
78,Moana,9,26 December 2016,Another beautiful and memorable classic from Disney,"Moana falls in line next to Tangled and Frozen as an instant classic 'Disney Princess' movie. The stand-out performance of Auli'i Cravalho as the voice of Moana carried the emotional weight of the movie through some of Disney's most beautiful songs to date, while Dwayne Johnson's experience as an actor provided the necessary humour and comedy to support the young Hawaiian-born actress in her acting debut. Dwayne Johnson's performance singing 'You're Welcome' was also a very pleasant surprise.The supporting cast is also full of surprises, and so many of the lesser songs are still immensely moving. The film is certainly transported from scene to scene by the music, and the native languages featured in some of the numbers shows Disney's respect and appreciation of the culture they're exploring.Disney's animation has also taken another leap, and the quality of the movie's visuals is surpassed only by the immense care and detail the animators showed in every scene.It has its issues, of course, as all films do. The plot is predictable, and as bitter-sweet as the ending is, it's certainly not going to be a surprise. As is the case with all animated family films, there is rarely a fear of the protagonist being in any significant danger, and a happy ending is inevitable.If you want a feel-good movie with fun songs, good laughs, and a simply happy, yet still rewarding ending, Moana is definitely the top movie of 2016 for you."
79,Moana,,2 December 2017,Best Moana Review EVER,"This review, by my 2-year old grand-daughter, contains a spoiler.She just loves this movie, and watches it again and again. Her review is the best of all time. Spoiler Alert. She says: ""Moana put the rock back."" Can we all agree that pretty much sums it up?"
80,Moana,7,2 October 2017,Propped up by beautiful animation,"'Moana' is a decent movie, however there are a few flaws that bring it down--chiefly odd pacing and below average songs. In terms of pacing, the character development felt very rushed, often with characters changing over the course of a few seconds after one small event. The development almost felt like an afterthought. The songs, I felt, were not up to Disney's standards, with the exception of ""You're Welcome"" the songs/singing felt kind of stilted, falling just short of expectations. It almost felt as if the producers cut the time spent on developing the songs, as they were thought out well but just missed in execution. I believe if some more time was spent tweaking the songs they would have delivered.However, Moana's most glaring flaws are obscured by it's animation. The movie is visually stunning, especially the water/sea. It is worth watching just for the visuals alone. Honestly, if it weren't for the visuals, I would have given Moana around a 5.5 as the story was a bit lacking, but Disney did such a fantastic job on the animation that I would have no problem giving 'Moana' a 7.5, even if it had been a silent movie."
81,Moana,10,28 September 2017,Uplifting,"I went into this film expecting the typical 'Disney Princess' story of a journey resulting in new found love. However, Moana is not a typical 'Disney Princess' film.The plot is interesting and innovative and the characters feel so real that an attachment is immediately forged. Its packed full of comedy and suspense and the musical numbers are an added bonus. The story itself is bursting with culture and knowledge all of which boosts the experience. Its a brilliant film for the whole family and i have found myself in love with it. I would recommend to anyone and everyone!"
82,Moana,6,17 July 2017,A fun Disney animation without the heart to make it a classic,"At this present moment in time it feels as though Disney has a license to print money and their certainly not stopping anytime soon with countless remakes on the calendar for the next few years and original properties like last year's Xmas time animated hit Moana that are finding instant successes with their target audiences, that will likely see them become family favourites in the present and the years to come.You can almost envision the Disney power players gathered around the table, their eyes lighting up at the pitch of Moana, about kindly and magically gifted young girl (continuing on the Mouse House's recent output of strong willed female heroines) that just so happens to be an Polynesian native (covering off the diversity side of requirements) all the while having a story that's conveniently tailored made too a few song and dance numbers that will have the kids singing and adults wishing they never bought the official soundtrack and you can pretty much guarantee in a few years' time Moana will be hitting a stage near you too live its new life as a feel good audience pleasing stage hit.It really does feel as though Moana owes a lot to past Disney hits like Mulan, The Lion King and recent box office behemoth Frozen and while the island/ocean setting of the story and the addition of everyone's favourite ex-pro wrestler Dwayne Johnson as the voice of Demi-God Maui set's Moana a part from these films, Moana doesn't actually end up delivering anything that fresh or new to the old age staple of young protagonist that doesn't mind being a rebel saving the day after an adventure filled quest and it's a shame that Moana doesn't utilise its ample potential to become anything more than a nice piece of colourful entertainment.Filled with animal sidekicks (crazy eyed chicken Heihei steals the film), the aforementioned musical numbers that are more pleasant that instantly singable and Moana herself who's voiced with a lot of life by rising star Auli'i Cravalho but the film never truly breaks out to join the ranks of classic Disney heroines, Moana as a whole remains constantly middle of the road and you'd be hard pressed to find many that will be mentioning this outing in the future years as Disney unloads more and more similar fair into the great wide world.Final Say  Energetic and sometimes laugh out loud funny, Moana is an audience appeasing event that's tailor made to keep the little tykes content and the senses dazzled but the heart that transforms some Disney films into the instant classics they become is curiously missing here and it stops Moana from being anything but a mostly forgettable diversion.3 evil coconuts out of 5"
83,Moana,10,1 December 2016,A heartwarming-magical voyage of oceanic proportions!,"I've seen it eight times already! I just can't stop riding in the canoe along lovable Maui and Moana! Looking forward to watching it nth times! Can't help myself. It's like entering my personal holographic suite: a 1.5 hours Paradise-oceanic-adventure with such charismatic characters in an engaging and thoughtful story. Absolutely beautiful and enchanting. The Wonderful:It's gorgeous in all possible ways  character design, environments, storytelling, etc. I giggle, I laugh, I cry, I sob, I feel the ocean spray! I touch the water! So vivid! Sometimes the animation reminds me of Hannah Barbera afternoon cartoons (Jabberjaw, etc.), just love it!From the beginning, we know that Moana is qualified to undertake such a mission  to save her island and her people. Along the story, we see how she behaves and reacts to situationshints that she will be able to overcome future adversities. I loved how toddler Moana gives up a treasure to protect the innocent: so young and already showing how big her heart is. I loved the storytelling embedded in Maui's body tattoos. Amazing! Cute. Maui is a rough funny guy, but he is easily lovable, once we learn what's in his heart and mind. Maui seems scary at first, but he shows us how charming he is with his song. Right then I know I'm going to totally love him! I also thought Maui was a perfect blend of Hulk, Hercules, Lou Ferrigno all hybridized into Dwayne Johnson's caricature, voice and performance (I love how Maui's smile/eyes mirror D. Johnson's eyes/smile) Brilliant! The emotional content and the empowering message weaved throughout the story is very strong. Moana fulfills her mission and any self-doubt is extricated. She discovers who she really is and realizes her full potential. As for Maui, he re-discovers his human heart! At first I thought the crab scene was too long, but then I realized it was necessary for Maui's hardship (which would later becomes gratitude).Loved the songs(I sing along in the late showings if I'm alone in the auditorium!) The lyrics move the story forward and give us insight into the character's hearts and minds. Clever! And with all the humor splashing about I giggled lots too. Little children just love the scenes with the pig and the rooster!The scenes with the fleet of boats and canoes give me goosebumps and chills! It's so magical! I just want to be there myself! So many spectacular sweeping ocean vistas. Wow! Also, the workings of light and shadow, the water kinetics, the night scenes, etc. Absolutely brilliant and genius!The voice performance is perfectly harmonized: Dwayne Johnson makes a brilliant and authentic Maui. Cravahlo infuses true life into sixteen-year-old Moana, making her full of spirit. Amazing animation! Moana's and Maui's gestures and emotional expressions are sublime, Grandma's are fantastic too!Moana's story and animation pulses with real life. I read that the Disney-animation team visited the Pacific Islands and did lots of character exploration. (more details in www.variety.com and Moana's interview in www.insidethemagic.net).The think-about-it: At first, Maui is ogre-ish, tossing Moana into the water (was this roughness really necessary?, not my favorite). But when he realizes that Moana is not alone (she has the Ocean protecting her), and that she is a highly determined, kind, and brave teenager; he learns to respect her and admire her. The climatic point of his change of heart is when Moana saves his lifeyou'll see!Moana's desire to help her people and revive her island makes her strong and resilient, so she learns how to journey along Maui and steers him to become a good human. And precisely this adversity she faces (with a little help of the good forces that accompany her) allows her to discover who she really is/who she is meant to be. So inspiring!Conclusion?Never give up your dream, no matter how ""ogreish"" your adversity is! Please watch it! It's a paradise worth sailing into nth-times! It's entertaining, stunningly beautiful, emotional, and it'll warm your heart with hope and satisfaction."
84,Moana,8,23 December 2016,Moana excels because of its excellent imagery/visuals and wonderful performance/characterisation,"While the trailers did absolutely nothing for me, the film is nothing but a pleasant and enjoyable surprise.Moana's characterisation is top-notch here, evident through the titular character herself; Moana is depicted as a skilled, warm-hearted and kind-natured girl on a journey to discover her true identity, creating an inspiring tale that deserves to be taken to audience's hearts as they did to the female leads of Frozen - if not, even more so because, quite frankly, this is a far superior film. Cravalho's passionate voice performance is magnificent and infectious, making her the perfect fit for the role, coming across a very sweet but headstrong character - very often at the same time. She is one of Disney's most well-defined and sketched characters of all time, with her determination not going unnoticed in a moment of film's entire runtime, giving the film a great focus through and through. Maui is far more one-dimensional than Moana but even he is awarded his own character arc that depicts his realisation that Moana is far more skilled than he gives her credit for, with Johnson capturing his journey with great enthusiasm. The story is one that, although not revolutionary and sometimes in need of a little shake up and few more risks being taken, is an inspiring watch and totally engrossing. Moana's first act features some of the best work in the genre of all time, acting as a masterclass in introducing characters, building a world and setting-up a story without ever overwhelming audiences. A few minutes could be trimmed from the second act, including an entire scene where the pair attempt to recapture Maui's magical fishhook, which feels squarely aimed at younger children while only slowing down the thrill and enchanting journey for everyone else (it feels more Illumination than Disney), but the runtime generally races by in a whirlwind of beauty and inspiration. Its feminist influence, while clear, remain subtle and nuanced enough to avoid feeling completely forced upon audiences, whilst still managing to inspire those smart and mature enough to understand them.

85,Moana,8,21 December 2016,"Beautiful island and people, my thoughts on the haters","I have read a lot of negative reviews of this movie. Their complaints are that the plot was predictable and boring, and it was too similar to other animated films, so it was a greedy Disney formula. I haven't watched any animated films lately, and I haven't seen Disney since I was much younger. For me, it's going to seem more fresh and unique for that reason. Most modern American movies have happy endings,so it is usually pretty predictable. Old movies usually make a point to have a surprise ending. (I also have been watching Chinese dramas, which often have sad endings, which leaves more room for plot twists.)Complaining about the Disney formula? Princess main character, fights evil and wins? Ummmmm? That is Disney,OK. Why are you watching Disney and complaining then? Maybe the movie is not for your demographic? If so, again don't watch it. If no other Disney movie was ever made,and you had nothing to compare this movie to, I found things about this movie very touching. A few times I found myself crying and it was the strangest thing because I didn't understand why. The movie didn't make me happy or sad, but it was chilling and it shook me. These people complaining about boring, predictable plots need a heart transplant. The connections she had with the ocean, her family, ancesestors and feeling the hope to restore and save them. It was really deep, and supernatural. The way certain parrs were animated porreayed it in a beautiful and amazing way. I also watched Dr.Strange on the same day as this movie and the plots of both movies had many similarities, and I couldn't find anyone else talking about it on the internet. But, I thought it was odd to watch two movies so similar to each other on the same day, one a marvel movie one a Disney movie. No one notices the plot similarities?"
86,Moana,5,27 February 2017,"Stunning animation, but nothing memorable","I absolutely loved everything that had to do with the animation, the colors and the setting were simply beautiful. I found however everything else mediocre. The characters, both main and sidekicks, were uninspiring and the story unoriginal and a bit too long. My worst part were the singing bits. I'm a huge Disney fan and I love the songs from every Disney movie I've ever seen and this movie had the worst ones. It was the first time I found myself saying ""Oh no, not another song"". Not one was catchy or funny and some I found to be off-beat and meaningless. 5/10 only for the beautiful island the story took place, the water effects and the magnificent colors."
87,Moana,6,5 December 2016,Just average,I took my grand daughters to see this Disney film hoping it would be good. It was just average with forgettable songs and a forgettable hero. They created a reasonable back story but the execution and dialog just lagged. One of my grand daughters fidgeted the entire movie out of boredom. The ending is the only thing that redeemed the movie from total disaster. Disney really should have done better with this film. They seem to have trouble when their not dealing with an already created fairy tale. I will have to say that the animation was stellar as usual which made the lack of story and character engagement the more sad. I guess they might sell a few toys but Moana in not a princess that young girls are going to remember.
88,Moana,8,4 December 2016,Beautiful Movie,"""Moana"" is an exemplary demonstration of what Disney Animation can pull out at their best. The story is rich in culture and symbols. Characters feel true and develop beautifully. Of course, the visual aspects are beyond belief: every color and texture is vibrant and full of detail.While it does fall into some Disney princess tropes(although we are reminded adamantly that she is not a princess per se but a chief's daughter), there is enough newness to ""Moana"" that it does not feel like a retread. She is rebellious but dutiful, innocent but strong, and the involvement of her (hilarious) animal sidekick is kept to a minimum. What is surprisingly refreshing is that there is no love interest to distract from the main conflict (not that I have any issue with other Disney characters having romantic side-stories).My only critique of ""Moana"" would have to be with it's music. There are some truly wonderful melodies, particularly ""We Know the Way,"" which manages to resonate with all that is wonderful about the music of the pacific. However, I felt some other numbers were not on par with the best of Disney classics. I do not know if Lin-Manuel Miranda was responsible for the lyrics, but whoever was should be told that words do not rhyme with themselves. ""Go"" does not rhyme with ""go,"" and ""island"" does not rhyme with ""island."" Using this sort of rhyming pattern once or maybe a couple times can be bold and memorable, repeatedly just makes it sound like they couldn't come up with better lyrics.Overall, I greatly enjoyed this film. The visuals were incredible, the plot well paced, and the story beautifully told. I had a great time watching ""Moana"" and would recommend it to anyone who does not mind being transported to a magical, tropical paradise for a couple hours."
89,Moana,10,15 May 2017,Simply fantastic...,"It is indeed very rare that I toss a top rating at an animated movie, but ""Moana"" definitely deserves that.The storyline in ""Moana"" was quite good and rather thrilling. It is a storyline that appeals to both a younger and older audience, because the story is timeless and has classic elements of good versus evil and the uprising of an unlikely underdog heroine. But it is also the story of friendship, forgiveness and acceptance.Shortly summarized, ""Moana"" is about young Moana whom is the daughter of the chieftain of a dying island. She goes against the edicts of the tribe and sail out beyond the reef to search for a demigod who has the power to set things right.The animation and the art style in ""Moana"" was just spectacular. There was just something very alluring and beautiful to the particular style that was used for this animated movie. And the levels of detail was just bedazzling. There were so many impressive details in every scene, and it looked so very real. I was especially impressed with the hair and the way that they had drawn the characters. Moana was very charismatic, while Maui was lovable.""Moana"" also has some good dialogue that keeps the movie up in a constant beat, well assisted by a good amount of action and storytelling.And while were are on the topic of dialogue, then ""Moana"" had some really good voice acting talents on the cast ensemble. Auli'i Cravalho really did a wonderful job, and she is quite talented. It was also a treat to have Dwayne Johnson do the voice for the demigod Maui. I didn't know that Alan Tudyk also voices a character in this movie.There is a fair amount of singing in this animated movie too, and it actually worked quite well in favor of the movie, for different reasons. The first being that the songs were quite appropriate for the story and fit naturally into the movie. The songs are also quite nicely orchestrated and performed. Usually, I am not overly keen on songs in animated movies, but ""Moana"" did it quite as well as ""The Little Mermaid"" did back in 1989.I was instantly blown away by the comedic element of the chicken that came along on the oceanic journey. That chicken was just downright hilarious and really spiced up the movie quite a lot, pardon the pun.As I mentioned in the start of my review, then it is very rare that I give a top rating for an animated movie, and only have done so once before to ""Epic"". But ""Moana"" ranks up alongside with it, because this is a fantastic animated movie in every sense of the word. I watched it with my family, and we all loved the movie and were very entertained by it.This is definitely an animated movie that is well-worth watching and this is a movie that rightfully belongs in the collection of anyone who enjoys animated movies. And this is an animated movie that you can watch more than just once."
90,Moana,10,17 April 2017,Our new favorite movie!,"Okay let me be honest for a minute, I know many of you do not care for Dwayne Johnson's (the Rock) acting abilities, however I feel you should give him an opportunity to ""wow"" you in the movie. Although he has always been one of my favorite actors (yes I have had a crush since his wresting days), he allows ""Maui"" to come alive and have a lot of personality, and doesn't do too bad with the singing either. Everyone in this movie was absolutely fantastic! It is my 2 year old grandson's favorite movie and he can now sing many of the songs. Yes, we own the DVD and watch it every night! I highly recommend it for everyone to watch!"
91,Moana,5,24 February 2017,Trump? Clinton? PFF My vote goes for the Chicken!,"Moana does quite a few thing in the bad way, some more in the average - and few godly. The bad lies mainly in the writing with the following:1) The adults are always so stoopid. Don't do this, don't do that. Why does the princess always have to fight against these DUMBtulds. Seriously Disney, don't be so cliché. 2) The tattoo score counting was rigged! The princess clearly lost. So unfair!!The things that were so-so:1) The OST. ""Worse thing about Disney movies is the singing."" While I loved The ""Dwayne Johnson"" Rock singing 'You're Welcome', some of the other songs were bad. Especially the lyrics were rather cheesy and cringe-worthy. 2) Moana. I didn't like her character nor did I enjoy seeing her character development. ""I am a princess who has been raised as one."" Yeah, same old story which was never good to begin with. The gold:1) Chicken. Should have been the real main character of this movie. Should be the president of United States. Also Pollo, Mexican and a total genius of our time. Did Disney secretly give their support to Trump by making this character? Either way, Chicken made the movie."
92,Moana,10,24 November 2016,"Emotional Journey, Authentic and Eye Candy AF","As a Polynesian, there are principles and values that are central to our culture that for many years I've tried to share with anyone I meet. Actually many people from Hawaii and the Pacific get this, even non-Polys :-). This story by Disney really brought many of those values out to the larger screen, to a larger audience, and I didn't realize seeing it this way would affect me so... deeply. When baby Moana first stepped onto that beach in the early part of the movie... flower in her hair, sun kissed skin... ""the feels"" are an understatement. My sister and I shed a few tears as if we were seeing a reflection of our own childhood on a beach in Hawaii -- the happiness, the curiosity, the innocence,the sea. Yeah, the feels happened and it was GREAT.The story of the Polynesians voyaging across the Pacific; the sense of ohana and family; how important coconuts are to island life; how the island provides all you need; sense of duty to go out and seek solutions and bring them home; chickens and pigs all over the place (!); the beautiful and varied languages; the dancing; the art and craft of the tapestries (tapa/kapa cloth) and other designs; the canoe designs; the laughing; the relationship with the ocean.... these are all real things we as Pacific Islanders feel in a beautiful, unique life. One great example of authenticity: I also loved that instead of handshakes or just hugs as a greeting in the movie, Disney used the honi, a traditional Polynesian greeting which I recommend to everyone! The honi is a Polynesian greeting in which two people greet each other by pressing noses and inhaling at the same time. This is a very special as it represents the exchange of ha--the breath of life, and mana--spiritual power between two people.This was a well done movie. Breathtakingly beautiful... and actually not so far off from reality (anyone who's been to Tahiti or Samoa will get it). Disney deserves credit for bringing so much joy and pride to a people that are often associated with tikis and grass skirts... We are so much more, and the story told is a great start to learn more deeply and authentically, in my opinion."
93,Moana,,12 January 2017,Disney within Disney,"I was expecting a standard, manufactured Disney Princess item. What I encountered was a powerful embodiment of myth in a young woman, with the notable exceptions of the coconut pirate and glittery crab sequences. These were conceived and directed by others. I suppose many commenters will speak to the different appealing techniques used here. I'll just speak to the visual narrative nesting because I've been tracking this from Lassiter's early work.The simplest example of this nesting is when two-d hand drawn animation is embedded in the three-d world. I believe that over time, a law of proportional abstraction has developed. When this works, we may see a film that has an inner film of some kind that is more abstract. The cinematic effect is to set the 'distance' between us and the main film. That is, we have a sort of quantum imagination where the simplifications we negotiate with a filmmaker are recorded in what he/she shows us as simplifications the movie's characters make with inner 'films. Showing us those inner films is a part of the filmmaker-viewer agreement. We do have that here with the depiction of Te Fiti and especially Te Ka, with the visions Moana has, rendered in decades old conventions. But something new is here: the story starts with literal story panels in animated tapa cloths that tell the outer story about the gods, demigod and the natural laws we will live in. That inner story is rendered in lovely, textured three-d using the now standard conventions of super-reality to register as real. But inside THAT story is the same two-d conventions in the demigod's living tattoos. While the 3-d flow moves through the future, the two-d panels not only remind us of the past and the world's dynamics but directly interact with the characters.The refreshing novelty here is that the tattoo/tapas cloth effect is used for the reverse purpose. The common distance is maintained, but in this case there are not three layers (our world, the movie, the movie within) but two: our world as the same as Moana's and the 'movie' world as the myth, the tattoo and mystical/god world. I think this is why the movie, the main movie with her life played out in it, seemed so close to me emotionally. Masters of cinematic engineering. See this: 3 of three."
94,Moana,7,28 January 2017,Well-crafted but slightly disappointing movie,"It is a well-crafted movie from Disney that introduced some Polynesian culture to me. The whole story line is standard, but there were some humorous scenes here and there which kept me very engaged. There are lots of songs in the movie. It might be a trend from Frozen since both have a princess as the leading character. However, I am a little disappointed about the quality of the songs, especially considering the involvement of Lin-Manuel Miranda who created Hamilton, a masterpiece. I am little confused about the ability of the ocean. It is not consistent at all. It left me wondering why doesn't the ocean directly spray water all over the Te Ka?"
95,Moana,9,1 January 2017,Moana Leads us on a Fun Adventure,"Earlier this year, Elizabeth posted an article looking forward to the movie Moana. Despite the aggressively mediocre trailers that Disney had put out, she was excited for the film, and her excitement proved to be well-placed. Moana delivered far more than the lack luster trailers promised.The film follows Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), a spunky princess who leaves her island to embark on an epic quest to return the stolen heart of the Goddess Te Fiti. After forming an alliance with the Demigod Maui (Dwayne the Rock Johnson), the two set off across the seas to find the Goddess. Along they way there are many adventures including a run-in with a giant crab voiced by Jemaine Clement, a lot of laughs, and a whole lot of fantastic music.While the story in Moana isn't revolutionary, Disney is pushing some new ground in other areas. The animation is beautiful, much of the cast and music was created by artists from Pacific Islands (although it was still directed by a couple white guys), Moana is a strong female character drawn in realistic human proportions, and most refreshingly of all there was no love story. While I love Disney's recent push towards less misogynistic films, it seems odd to applaud them for starting to break down stereotypes that they created. Don't get me wrong, Moana is an awesome heroine, but It's sad that we applaud Disney for creating a strong female character who can stand on her own. That should be the expectation, and anything else, anything that hearkens back to the early days of Disney princesses needs to be rejected. There are many many reasons to commend Moana aside from its lack of misogyny. The beautiful animation, the killer score from Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina, and Opetaia Foa'i, the consistent jokes, and the stellar voice work add up to an extremely fun movie. Moana doesn't quite stack up to the heights that Disney reached earlier this year with Zootopia, but If you're looking for a pick me up after 2016, this is the movie to grab."
96,Moana,8,1 December 2016,"""Moana""-  A solid and entertaining new animated fantasy adventure that's filled to burst with charm.","The advent of high-quality computer animation has brought about a modern wave of fantastic new Disney adventures. From the delightfully quirky ""Tangled"" to the incredibly popular and captivating ""Frozen"", Disney has been hard at work delivering consistently strong and captivating films. 2016's ""Moana"" is Disney's latest installment in their ever-growing filmography, and while it might never quite live up to the highest of standards set by their classics both new and old, it's still very much a thoroughly engaging and entertaining feature.Inspired by Polynesian mythology and culture, we follow Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), the young daughter of her island's chief, who yearns for something more despite being forbidden from ever going beyond the reef surrounding her home. However, when the plants begin to with and die, leaving her people without a viable source of food, Moana sets out on a grand adventure. She must brave the seas to find the legendary demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and get his help to restore order and save her people by returning the mystical stone heart of the ancient goddess Te Fiti to its original resting place- a stone Maui had stolen hundreds of years ago. Together, the two will brave vile monsters and devious pirate-like creatures along with the deadly wrath of the ocean in order to try and save Moana's home.It's a very simple tale, and that's where much of its charm comes from. A great portion of the film takes place on a raft with only Moana and Maui (along with a hilariously dim-witted chicken that stowed aboard), and thus the film goes through a lot of creative means to develop and endear the characters for the audience. It's bold because the film is so sort-of isolated in it's second and third acts, but it's always consistently amusing and there's plenty of great character-beats to keep the audience giggling at a near- constant pace. I was honestly shocked that Disney was able to make what was essentially over an hour of characters just talking and occasionally stumbling upon a new obstacle so much fun to watch. No doubt another large part of the film's success lies in the delightful cast. Cravalho is an absolute joy as our heroine and will melt your heart in nearly every scene. She also has a nice spunk and drive so she never once becomes the archetypal damsel in distress. This is Disney doing strong female characters just right. Johnson steals the show in just about every scene and is a ton of fun as a sort-of braggart with just enough humanity to keep you rooting for him. Great comedic role that lets Johnson- a pretty talented actor- stretch his chops. Rachel House, Temuera Morrison and Nicole Scherzinger round out the cast in supporting roles that are all lovely and very well- played.The animation and direction is just awe inspiring as well. Even though everything is given that nice, over-stylized Disney look, you still feel very much like everything you're seeing is real. It was stunning just how detailed and true to life the water and sand animation was, and characters are all very well realized with fun designs and great movement. Directors Ron Clements and John Musker, previously responsible for other Disney films like the now-classic ""Aladdin"" and ""Little Mermaid"" have a wonderful dramatic sense of scope and composition, which really hits home with the story being told.While I could bemoan the fact that the film is a slave to formula and has some issues with the pacing in its first act, the fact of the matter is that this is another good, strong effort and continues Disney's winning streak. So I don't mind the issues that are there... it's too much fun to care. It just goes to show that perhaps we are now in the middle of a second renaissance for the company's animation department and that we'll have many more quality films like this to look forward to. I give ""Moana"" a very good 8 out of 10."
97,Moana,7,30 November 2016,"Moana has plenty of fun moments, even if doesn't have much new to find with it's Disney formula","Disney has a long history of making family animated features that feature your princess, a comedic side character, villain, and of course, memorable songs that the children are going to sing for their school pageants. The majority of them are very good, though it wasn't until twenty years ago that Disney expanded the diversity of their characters. I think the first princess that wasn't white was Pocahontas. The bloated roster has introduced Mulan who is Chinese, Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame who is gypsy, and Tiana from The Princess and the Frog who is black. The next animated tale from Disney now gives us a Polynesian princess. While adding her to the long line of princesses may not seem like a big deal, her presence marks something progressive for the company. We happen to live in a society that only has expanding minorities and to acknowledge that is a smart choice. Given how a few people have said so, people are willing to accept new kinds of characters; especially ones that kids can look up too. Moana is the name of our new character, and the newest animated film from Disney. In the prologue, we learn about how all life was created by the goddess Te Feti and became an island. But when demigod Maui (played by Dwayne Johnson) steals the islands heart, a spiritual stone, dark forces come after him. He looses the stone and his magical fishhook that gives him his shape shifting powers. Hundreds of years later, on a small island in Polynesia, Moana Waialiki (played by Auli'I Cravalho) is the daughter of the village chief. She's discouraged from going near the water, as is the entire tribe, to keep them safe. The dark forces I mentioned earlier, start to invade her island with no fish in the ocean and the fruit growing becoming rotten. At the encouragement of her grandmother, she not only discovers that her people were voyagers, but she takes one of the boats and the heart of Te Feti, and goes out to find Maui.After a storm, she finds Maui on an island where he's been exiled all this time. Upon meeting him, she finds him egotistical and very selfish who is only looking to return to being a hero for his fans. The two eventually agree to help him find his fishhook in exchange for him returning the stone.As far as Disney movies are concerned, Moana is very good. Good, but not great. Disney shouldn't have anything to worry about as the main character is a lot of fun to follow and is very likable. Dwayne Johnson, though bringing a lot of his similar traits from other movies, gets a lot of good lines and even manages to sing his song well (he's not a strong singer, but he puts a lot of emotion into his performance). Animation again looks amazing. The best thing here is the music, as the songs are composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda (responsible for the Broadway hit Hamilton). They are very catchy and may have something that can finally knock off Frozen's ""Let it Go"".So what's wrong with the movie is everything sounds good? I think its more what Disney is giving us as apposed to what the movie is giving. Moana has A LOT of the elements that you typically see in their other movies (they even joke about that in the movie). I'll give credit to Zootopia, as that not only offered more new twists, but took more chances with its material. Moana feels a tad safe when compared to the latter. That shouldn't stop people from having fun with this Polynesian set tale. I'll give this seven fishhook weapons out of ten. Moana has a lot to keep the family entertained, even if it's not offering much new. I still recommend it if you're a fan of anything Disney related. Set sail and see what you can find!"
98,Moana,9,23 November 2016,Catchy songs and culture with surprises from voice talent,"Moana features catchy songs and fantastic animation in addition to a well crafted story that feels both ancient and modern at the same time. Moana and Maui have excellent chemistry on screen and both Cravalho and Johnson surprised us with their ability to convey humor, emotion and song with their voices. We were glad to see a female protagonist introduced into the Disney universe who wasn't part of a love interest or even have a love interest at all  unless you count a love for her people and the ocean. The movie also does a nice job of conveying Polynesian/Samoan culture and even has a couple of catchy songs sung in Traditional Tokelauan.Overall, Moana is enjoyable and fun to watch  if there was a negative side about the movie it would be that much time is spent with the two characters on a raft and reminded us a bit of the Kevin Costner movie Waterworld. We would have liked to have seen a secondary plot that may have kept us involved for the roller-coaster ride and maybe even some explanation as to the significance of some of the cultural elements germane to the story."
99,Moana,10,13 March 2017,Moana,"I ABSOLUTELY love this film it has a great story-line and plot and also gets you thinking the same question over and over"" can I be like Moana , Am I achieving the impossible, will I achieve my full Potential? Auli'i Cravalho is amazing she has a rich beautiful voice and I'm sure she made her family proud..."
100,Moana,10,3 March 2017,Beautiful,"Oh, it was such a beautiful movie!!! So nicely made and it had an amazing story. I don't think that I've ever seen an animation based on a Polynesian tribe, so it was very refreshing. All characters were so beautiful, with long curly hair and I was just loving them. Baby pig and chicken were unusual pets and it was another new and fun thing to see.I loved that the main character Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) was really brave and tough and strong and that the semi-god Maui (Dwayne Johnson) was sort of grumpy and pessimistic. They made a nice pair, similar to that of a human's heart and brain. Heart is positive and optimistic and brain is rigid and pessimistic. I really loved everything in the movie, everything seemed new, refreshing, never seen before...Even the crab was different, with a shiny shell... I got so inspired and encouraged by the ""Moana"" to follow my dreams and inner visions that I was carrying the mood of this film for the next two days. I even dreamed ""the Sea Monster"" at night (and I'm 33).It was a powerful movie, with a magnificent story, great dialogues, beautiful songs, cute funny pets, new culture and a great lesson. It was simple yet incredibly rich...It was perfect! Everyone can enjoy it, get inspired and learn from it! As they say: ""The greatest wisdom lies in simple things"" (although I'm sure it wasn't simple to make it, it does look like an enormous effort, so thanks for the makers!)"
101,Moana,8,7 February 2017,Moana a self-discovery journey,"Moana brings the Mulan (1998) formula and it delivers a home-run. The movie begins on a slow pace so you can start getting to know what the character has to deal with in order to get you ready with the main dilemma for Moana which will be to either follow your passion and dreams or be the princess you are supposed to be ignoring your goals, this may be a detractor for some people who likes a fast paced action movie since the beginning. With the newcomer Auli'i Cravalho as the voice of Moana, she did a wonderful job on bringing the character to life and giving it that desire to see her triumph in her journey of self-discovery. We are taken alongside Moana on her growing up phase acting as the teenager she is instead of the grown up they want her to be. This road takes us to meet our main support character which is Maui the demigod voiced by Dwayne ¨The Rock¨Johnson. Dwayne Johnson delivered an incredible voice acting job as Maui, we haven't seen ¨The Rock¨on this type of roles and surprisingly it could be one of his best role in recent years, this said the character Maui also had it's journey to once again know himself and remember who he was and why he did the things he did, this was something that made the character special since on the long run you could also be striving for Maui to change and be better. Now for the movie as a whole it had it's usual clichés every Disney movie has, this movie delivers it's formula with a well thought script and story that it didn't feel as the same thing we have seen even though you may know what it's going to happen. For the songs in the movie they were done perfectly, even though it will not be a trademark song like Frozen (Let it Go), this movie did well to get the children's engaged and sing (I am Moana), but this is not memorable as Frozen at all, so for this category as Best Original Song it's highly unlikely it will win, but it well deserves its nomination, also with the contribution of Lin-Manuel Miranda director of Hamilton in the movie this definitely deserved its spot in the Oscars. With all this said, you will definitely enjoy the journey of Moana and Maui the demigod since the movie delivers well thought songs, a good Disney formula and each of the characters with their own unique personality will engage you in a certain way that you will be rooting for both of them to accomplish their goal and at the end you will be happy with their results. It deserves its solid 8/10."
102,Moana,10,1 February 2017,Enjoyable entertainment with character,"My friend has strong connections with Hawaii and urged us to see Disney's latest animation.With an open mind and no expectations, I settled back to see what was on offer.Many of the portrayals I found surprising, and, for me, that added to the character of the film.The animation flows impeccably.I found the timing and rhythm of the story telling to be right on target.Scanning some of the more disparaging reviews makes me wonder about how one's frame of mind can change perception, perhaps seeing too many films creates impossible-to-meet expectations.As a moderate-to-low film/TV watcher, ""Moana"" was for me thoroughly enjoyable and engaging from beginning to end. I was being told a story I had previously not known even existed, and the story was told very well.""Well done Disney"", that's how I felt as I left the cinema."
103,Moana,9,20 December 2016,Classic Disney at it's best!,"CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERDisney films have always been a childhood favourite for me, from Lion King to Lilo and Stitch to Tangled (Even the princess ones, even though I'm a guy :) So when I heard about Moana, I knew I had to see it.Moana is an exciting, hilarious, emotional and imaginative film, that while continues a classical Disney formula, it is a great movie nonetheless. Here's why,1st- Moana is an energetic, inquisitive protagonist brimming with life and vitality, who thanks to Auli'i Cravalho's voice acting adds to the colourfulness of the film. Her sidekick Maui, voiced by The Rock is hilarious and charming alongside Moana, there's great back to back chemistry with the characters even in the more quieter, heartfelt moments. There's an underlying vulnerability to Moana and Maui, that's beautiful to watch. Let's not forget about the dim witted chicken, that brings laughs a bundle to the film.There's character traits from previous Disney characters, Anna and Rapunzel in Moana, but Moana is very different. 2nd - the animation as with all Disney films as of late with Frozen, Tangled, is beautifully realized. But for Moana, it's a visually dazzling display, the vivid exotic colours and the richness of the Polynesian landscapes, the seas, the islands, the culture, monsters is a beauty to behold. It's full of extravagance and vitality.3rd - the deep rooted use of Polynesian Culture, important to Moana's story is richly engaging and adds depth to the film. Her culture is what defines her, which is brilliant message for viewers (such as myself), for audiences yearning for more ethnically diverse Disney characters it is heartening to see a protagonist who's culture is deeply important to who they are. I know Disney have done cultural characters before, Princess and the Frog, Pocahontas, Mulan but here I genuinely feel there's respect and authenticity to the treatment of her culture, not tired and lazy stereotypes. Here's to more ethnically diverse characters in the future.Lastly, there's tender heartfelt moments where Moana feels incapable and hopeless on her journey , which we all feel sometimes, but she refuses to give up and carries on, which is inspiring and made me tear up a little. As well as other themes of identity, knowing who you are and what you want to be, are all great morals too.Moana's got heart, emotion, humour, character, story, beautiful visuals, morals. Moana is everything you want a Disney film to be and more! As Maui would say ""Your Welcome!"""
104,Moana,6,12 December 2016,Moana - Follows the Standard Disney Formula,"This is a musical animation, featuring a young girl who learns to follow her dream (that's the message). Very much like a pantomime this has a 'good winning over evil' theme with some memorable songs.There's a memorable 'stupid chicken' nutcase character, which I quite liked. We went with our 6 year old granddaughter, who looks just like Moana in so many ways. Although the film couldn't keep her full attention for very long.We saw it in 3d but that didn't add much depth, so you could easily get away with seeing the 2d version. I imagine this won't have the success of earlier films such as 'Frozen'."
105,Moana,8,26 December 2016,A lovable addition for Disney,"The eponymous Moana is an islander young woman, the chieftain's daughter, and must quest to rebalance nature with the help of the demigod Maui. The characters were lovable and the musical numbers were pretty good, but not as groundbreaking as some of Disney's previous titles. The animation was stunning though. The detail in the hair and the water was incredible. The film was also quite funny.I love themes of exploration - the idea of finding new frontiers, new lands; constantly striving to find new ideas to create more opportunities. This is an idea rooted in the Disney ethos and the film did it reasonably good justice. Other themes of parenthood, duty to society and the strength of the individual (not new for Disney at all) were well incorporated as well.Some of the scenes were a little bit too melodramatic without enough emotional buildup to compensate. Furthermore, the denouement was a bit off. It seemed to be simply stuffing in little nods to previous sections of the film. I think it could have ended much stronger; less is definitely more here and the film needed less emphasis on characters nodding sagely and patting on the back.Moana is a very good movie, certainly one of the best if not the best animated films this year, but does not quite hold up to the Disney classics."
106,Moana,8,26 December 2016,The latest adventure from Disney you MUST SEE!!!,"The movie is epic, even with heart-breaking moments now and then. It has a good choice of cast, that led to great songs, especially ""You're Welcome"" and ""How Far I'll Go"". I've honestly never heard 'The Rock' sing ever, and I'm surprised at how good he is, even Auli'i, because this is my first time I know her in something (even just knowing her,too!) Another adventurous, funny, and heart-breaking movie that's a success. There are so much more movies similar to that description like Frozen, Big Hero 6, and Zootopia, to name a few. But so far, Moana is my favorite movie of them all (that I've seen, at least)."
107,Moana,8,18 December 2016,A strong original property to birth another Disney franchise,"Moana has enough cute, lovable characters with strong entertaining songs and gorgeous animation that even at times when I found myself bored (and there were a few) I can see where this has the ability to expand into another tent pole franchise for Disney. Voice acting was spot on which seems to be a standard with Disney these days. Actors brought real emotion to the screen and comedic beats hit perfectly. Dwayne Johnson as Maui was charismatic, charming and all around stole the show, making me wonder if there is anything this WWE Star can do poorly at all?Animation was gorgeous, seriously. The ocean was a character in this movie and makes me wonder if was and intentional choice or because the animation and water texture was so strong that the byproduct is that the ocean can't help but be turned into a character. I'm not sure how much testing goes into these Disney movies but it's clear whatever Disney is doing they are paying attention to the details and doing their homework in order to release a product that will sustain them 20-30 years from now with the nostalgia that I feel from movies like Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast of any one of many Disney films from my own youth."
108,Moana,8,16 December 2016,"Disney Rarely Misses when it Comes to Animaton, Moana is no Exception","2016 while being a pretty screwed up year in a few different ways has been a solid year for animated movies. Zootopia and The Secret Life of Pets both did well and Kubo and the Two Strings is one of my favorite movies of the year. So where does Moana fit into this? I tried really hard not to compare Moana to the other terrific animated movies this year, which was really difficult to do, luckily Moana can stand up with those other movies, and in some cases exceeds them.I want to begin with reviewing the music, and while I believe music is the most subjective piece of art there is, there is no doubting that the music in Moana is fantastic. It has been a while since a Disney musical has gotten songs, that's plural, songs that got stuck in my head. The trio of Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa'i absolutely kill on the soundtrack with songs that really help to bolster the events taking place in the movie. If I were to pick the best part of Moana it would be the soundtrack.....or Moana is one of, if not the most impressive looking Disney movie to date. The lush setting of tropical islands really lets the animators do some incredible things, like waterfalls and trees with large green leaves. The water in Moana plays a huge role and man does it look good. There were moments where I was not sure if they had animated it or had combined the animation with real shots of the beach. The character animation is great as well, Moana herself being the best of the bunch. While I lean towards liking the animation in Kubo and the Two String a bit better there is no denying that Moana is the best looking animated movie of the year.Moanas' plot is pretty straight forward, Moana is the heir to the throne of the island that her family lives on, and even though her father believes it is best for his people to stay in the safety of their reef, Moana is drawn to adventure out into the ocean. There is also a bit of a conservation message in there too, but talking about that too much will be a bit of a spoiler. While both good themes for a children's movie, I feel that by the end of the movie, they had sort of put those to the side and falls off the moral rails a bit. While not plot shattering, I think it is important for these movies to complete their theme and give kids something to learn about when all is said and done.When I looked up the voice cast after the movie I was shocked to see that there were only 12 credited voice actors in the whole movie. Dwayne Johnson is great at so many things, and he is not a bad voice actor, he is actually a good one, but the performance of Auli'i Cravalho, both in singing and line reading is the performance that stands out in Moana. This young girl has a real talent and certainly a career ahead of her, and again to say that she out performs the Rock is no small feat.Moana is really great. There is almost no better way to say it. It's enjoyable and just the right length for a good animated movie. Sure there are some corny jokes in there and some decent sized plot holes but overall you really can't beat 2 hours of great animation and even better songs. Weather you have kids or are a big fan of animated movies, I am sure Moana will not disappoint. Worst case it may be nice to sit in a movie theater, or on the couch while it is -17 degrees outside and look at a beautifully drawn tropical paradise for a couple of hours this holiday season."
109,Moana,10,18 July 2017,A story about a young girl who doesn't know her true identity sets out to save her people,"Moana is such an inspiring movie about a young teenager set on an adventure to save her people and her island. Moana is lost on the island and doesn't truly understand who she is or who shes meant to be, but after she sets sail, she is able to find her voice. I also think that it is great that Moana is not your ordinary princess who is stick thin, but she actually has curves to her body which promotes body positive girls."
110,Moana,10,12 July 2017,A Perfect Disney Movie,"This is hands down one of the best Disney movies ever in my life. The animation is very beautiful, the characters are really likable, the humor is spot-on, the music in it is very enjoyable, the action in it is fantastic. I love this movie so much with a passion. This is easily my all time favorite Disney movie of all time, it's that good. This movie had lived up to a type, in any of it's expectations of being shoddy, this is one of the rarest animated movies that is absolutely flawless. The humor gets better with its considerable charm, some scenes does get sad in some parts, it is considerably one of the best that Disney had ever did. Even the voice-acting is brilliant, they did such a great job with the voice-acting, because it connects their personality of their characters. The plot is very admirable as well, because it focuses on a young Polynesian navigator who wants to become a master wayfinder, and with the help with the once powerful demi- god name Maui, it's up to him and her to stop the lava monster, and save her village. I really hope that it gets a sequel pretty soon because this movie is awesome, and it deserves to get a sequel. If you haven't seen it, go check it out, you'll be in for a real treat. Just, wow was this movie great, this is just amazing. I give this movie a 10/10 for being such a brilliant and perfect movie. Nothing has gotten bad at all, all it is, is just a brilliant Disney movie that the whole family can enjoy with likable characters, admirable animations, pleasing musics, awesome actions, and even some sad scenes that makes you cry."
111,Moana,,11 May 2017,"Disappointing, annoying and mean-spirited characters, formulaic","I had high hopes for Moana. A Disney film about a brave and fun Samoan-ish girl? What could be better? Moana started off strong. The beginning was interesting, with nice-looking characters and beautiful animation. But by the time they got to the demigod Maui, the film really went downhill. Maui is simply obnoxious. The interplay being the arrogant demigod and the ""brave"" Moana was just irritating and stupid. I didn't want to root for either character. It's 2017, filmmakers. Do you STILL need to drive in Title IX on such a superficial, patronizing level? I've been seeing girls kick ass my whole life (Disney's original Beauty & the Beast, anyone?), so I don't need filmmakers to drive it in more, in the most vapid way. Disney feels guilty for giving films to so many blond ""princesses,"" like Cinderella, Aurora, etc. It's gone to black with Tiana, and Asian with Mulan (stereotypical-looking), and now, it's moving on, probably for the first time, to the Pacific Islands/Polynesia. Pseudo-Samoans need their chance, too. I did notice in the film how ""realistic"" the characters' build, legs, and body types were. Looks like they modeled the demigod, physically, after Dwayne Johnson, who voiced the character. And the credits did show that Disney consulted with a few official Samoan or Polynesian ""experts"" - college professors, maybe? Writers and thought leaders? Looks like Disney's doing its job, diligently trying to portray Polynesian characters realistically and non-stereotypically. Would they give so much thought to Asian characters? I don't know. The film is just kind of dumb and superficial. They made the poor ugly chicken a scapegoat and comic relief. Moana's heroic dad is portrayed as a really handsome, buff guy. But the arrogant, annoying demigod is uglier, with a big but awkward build. Disney thinks good people are handsome/beautiful, and bad people are ugly. Disney itself made Beauty and the Beast, which drives in the fact that beauty is only skin deep, and the fabulous Belle learned to love a Beast. Stop being contradictory and hypocritical, Disney!The ending of Moana was an insipid disappointment, too. They had a demonic sea monstress turn into some earth mother loving green thing. O-kay! Very painful to watch. I thought Disney was master of animation and story, but they were really lacking this time around. The child-ish fiascos between Moana and the demigod are painful to remember - them throwing her precious green stone into the water, her jumping into the water and out? It would only appeal to young children. Get Moana out of my mind! Disney could've done a good job with their first(?) Samoan-ish run, but they didn't do a good job with it."
112,Moana,6,5 April 2017,Average Pixar fodder,"I've seen this plot in a gazillion Disney movies already, so honestly it's nothing special. There is your usual princess going against her parent's wishes, the funny sidekick, being forced to work together, having a bonding moment, conflict, miraculous resolution, etc. The songs were sub par, especially that ""I'm Shiny"" tune - funny, but weird. However, visually this is a stunning movie. The way water moved and integrated into special effect was awesome. Also, I loved The Rock as Maui. I wouldn't call it an instant classic, but not bad for a family night in."
113,Moana,,16 March 2017,A feminist remake of Hercules,"I found this idea to remake Hercules in a feminist key spectacular. I had more fun watching Hercules. And I have liked more the songs. Even the voice cast was better there. But this is finally a good departure from the breeder princess helpless in need of a man to rescue her and do adult stuff after the movie has ended.The script has holes. Not as big as I am used to see coming from what's labeled as Hollywood, but still, all the magic in the movie still can't cover them. Sure, after training with a demi-god, Moana can make a speedboat out of an wooden raft with sail. But her father wanted her away from the water. So how come she is able to sail so well a boat that is far more difficult to steer than the modern catamaran? How come she can swim so well with her father not letting her near the water. And if the ocean is so decided to keep her in the game, why do we even bother with a boat? Just to have the silly chicken keep falling off? And this one corrects the Teutonic standard of femininity so embraced by the late Walt Disney at the same time as adding some variety to the panel of existing princesses. But this is not Zootopia. The message is zero besides having a strong woman character. The gags are lower in quality and further apart. And it's simply a cross of mostly Hercules and some parts of Finding Nemo.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"
114,Moana,8,7 January 2018,a wonderful surprise - I loved it!,So good! the music reminded me of a combination of The Little Mermaid and Frozen - both favorites. I wouldn't be surprised if this wins Best Animated Feature Film this year!
115,Moana,8,7 January 2018,The Peak Of Contemporary Digital Animation,"Movie Review: ""Moana"" (2016)Directing duo Ron Clements & John Musker, responsible for a renaissance of classic hand-drawn analog-animated feature films at Disney Animation Studios with ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989) and ""Aladdin"" (1992), deliver family entertainment in cold winter months of holiday season 2016/2017 to fulminate cinematic successes of a perfectly-paced South-Pacific Adventure movie following demigod Maui, fulfilled with a strong vocal performance by actor Dwayne Johnson; a newly introduced Disney character gifted with the ability of animal-transformation as well as superhero-like fighting skills accompanied with his magic-spreading, out of a massive whale-bone shaped fishing hook. Maui surfaces at the right time to a calm Polynesia island, where the young character of title-given and as usually identity-searching Moana, performed in dialogue and a talented singing voice by 15-year-old Hawaiian Auli'i Cravalho, who sets sail to save their people from a doom-bringing environmental catastrophe.This Disney digital-animated feature becomes an instant classic with three for excellence-striving theme songs by composer Mark Mancina, embedded in the most traditional sense of initial 1920s / 1930s animator Walt Disney (1901-1966) into the action-packed and highly-defined as colorful details-sharing storyline from sailing open waters with a wooden catamaran to treasure-hunting dives into the depth of the sea with a knock-out singing performance by New Zealander Jemaine Clement with the song ""Shiny"" as Maui & Moana confront a gigantic crab covered in gold and diamond gems before the even further stake-raising showdown brings South Pacific native mythology onto the silver-screen in non-stop beating confrontations and eventually redemption in best Hollywood motion picture tradition. © 2018 Felix Alexander Dausend

116,Moana,5,6 January 2018,Moana **½ (5/10),"USA 2016 English (Colour); Animation (Walt Disney); 107 minutes (PG certificate)Crew includes: John Musker, Ron Clements (Directors); Jared Bush (Screenwriter); Osnat Shurer (Producer)Voices include: Auli'i Cravalho, Dwayne JohnsonThe adventurous daughter of a village chief (Cravalho) ventures beyond the reef to compel a shapeshifting demigod, minus magical powers (Johnson), to restore the heart he stole from her island which is now dying, and save her people.Beautiful animation is undone by annoying characters (although the stupid chicken sidekick is funny) and average songs."
117,Moana,9,5 January 2018,New Zealander point of view,"Great, Fun movie.I won't go into details about the whole Maui thing, but what made it fun for me was seeing Hawaiian, Samoan, Tongan and yes, New Zealand polynesian cultures in a big mishmash which offended no-one (I hope)"
118,Moana,,2 January 2018,Island girl,"This was another highly enjoyable Disney CGEN feature with an exciting story, lots of laughs, good songs, fine characterisation and most of all, brilliant animation.From the depiction of luxuriant tropical wildlife, frothy ocean spray and most of all the nuances of the ""human"" characters, the film is a feast for the eyes. As for the ears, they are well served too by catchy, idiomatic, singalong numbers and witty, funny dialogue not scared to run a little risqué to get a laugh.The story, of Disney necessity, touches on the tried and true, a young independent ""princess"", yearning for change and adventure, surmounting seemingly insurmountable odds on a quest to save the day, accompanied of course by a wise-cracking companion and just to top things off, a cute, dumb pet.The songs even if they seem like they've fallen off the same wagon as those in ""Frozen"" are nonetheless mostly pleasant and memorable and are well sung by the cast, even Dwayne Johnston. My main carp would be the use of derivative minion-lite coconut pirates Moana and Maui encounter on their journey but otherwise I found myself frequently caught up by the duo's escapades and interaction arriving at a big happy ever after climax which outdid the rest of the SFX in the process.Lovely film, first class family entertainment."
119,Moana,8,2 January 2018,Great looking and sounding ocean adventure,"'Moana' is a near-flawless family film from Disney. It's got pretty much everything: comedy (mostly from a chicken!), pathos, a good journey with some adversity to overcome, some self-discovery, a great sidekick, some songs, the death of a loved one (the Grandma (House)) and heaps of great animation/scenery.The Chief (Morrison/Jango Fett), doesn't want Moana (Cravalho) to leave their Pacific island, for fear of the big ocean, but she has to follow her destiny and find Maui (Johnson) to restore the heart of Te Fiti and restore balance to the islands. Maui obviously starts out as a bit of a jerk, but he endears himself to us with his well-meaning ways and hilarious moving-tattoos. The lava monster's cool, but not too scary - definitely OK for kids over 3.It's great to see/hear Polynesian actors, songs (particularly the tribal drums) and ancestral art/tattoos. There's a great voice cast - the Grandma is touching - and Clement (Flight of the Conchords) is hilarious as the giant/evil crab. However, it's Moana's film and she's charismatic, feisty and respectful, depending on the situation (helps that they chose a 14-year-old Hawaiian to play her!). She probably sings a few too many songs for me (think there's about seven in the film), and they definitely could've done without The Rock's song! It all ends happily, with her people voyaging again."
120,Moana,10,29 December 2017,Animation at its best! Now Officially one of my Favorite Movies!,"As an individual double majoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing (with a focus on screenplays) I have to say that Moana was one of the best Disney Movies that I have ever watched! In fact, I was astonished by its storyline along with its animations that it became one of my favorite movies and ended up buying my own Moana doll for Christmas!SPOILERS: In particular, I truly enjoyed the scenes where Moana gained the confidence to go out there and voyage into the sea even though her dad Tui wanted her to focus on being the chief for her people. The first time she went out didn't end so well (I was laughing so hard when Moana's Grandma said that whatever she did that she blamed in on the pig, Pua, which in fact, is one of the most adorable characters that Disney has ever created!), but I admire the confidence that she showed. This confidence showed me that we as individuals are truly individuals. I also loved the scene where Maui was trying to turn into the Hawk when he and Moana were trying to get the hook from Tamatoa's shell. It was hilarious to see him turn from a fish, to a shark, then a chameleon etc, then finally back to his human form. It made it even funnier when Tamatoa was saying that Maui was having trouble with his look as he was singing ""Shiny.""All and all, I can't think of anything wrong with this movie. This is one of the Disney Movies that I can watch over and over again!"
121,Moana,10,28 December 2017,"So many moronic, self made critics on this site!","Forget the idiots who think they know it all and think they're aim ass movie critics. Movies are meant to be fun to watch. Especially family movies and this 1 is no exception thaat is beautifully designed & animated. 
Set in the Hawaiian islands. Moana is an adventurous girl who is befriended by the ocean and is chosen to deliver te fitis heart along with maui across the ocean and restore life and ebb the growth of darkness from spreading across the earth and with hei hei the hilariously dumb rooster she embarks on her adventure against the chiefs (her fathers) wishes.
My daughter, my family and i absolutely adore this movie. A visual splendour it is. 
I've found a lot of viewers on imdb to be analytic morons who've forgotten how it is to enjoy a movie and get it so wrong, so many times!!!
Be the judge yourself.
Well worth watching."
122,Moana,8,27 December 2017,"The same ol' formula, but absolutely beautiful nonetheless","So I may be a teensy weensy bit biased as a former resident of the South Pacific who has a huge man crush on Lin Manuel Miranda, but I just plain loved this story. From the complex characters to the catchy music to the honoring of island culture, they knocked it out of the park. We've seen this Disney formula before, but I'm not sure we've ever seen it this well done."
123,Moana,10,22 December 2017,One of the best animated movies Pixar have made,"I don't rewatch movies a lot, but I think within half a year I watched this movie at least 4-5 times. There definitely is some flaws, most obvious to me is how they simplify some of the troubles the main characters face, but it's genuinely a good movie. The animal sidekick I am usually just annoyed by is surprisingly funny, and relevant to the plot! Not to mention it's not the sidekick you first thought it'd be. The music is super catchy and fun, and all the characters memorable. Some parts are just beautiful to watch, and the plot twist is one of the best handled I've seen in ANY movie, animated or not. Big recommendation!"
124,Moana,7,22 December 2017,Let the girls be Moana... and the boys be moaning...,"And Now For Something... Completely... Identical! ""Moana"" is a dazzling-looking story but to put it simply, it's not very interesting. The film is so obedient to all the recent trends that have defined Disney's movies that you can't find one little parcel of originality, it's basically ""The Little Mermaid"" story retold in ""Lilo and Stitch"" setting with a ""Pocahontas""-like character who's the same age than ""Brave"" and driven by a ""Frozen"" narrative. Oahu... Deja-Vu... and when a Hawaiian story leaves you cold, you know there's a problem.To give her deserved credit, Moana is a charming, adorable and strong-minded young preteen girl who has a lot to appeal to, but she's just too typical to strike as a fully developed Disney protagonist even when you try to ignore the trend. Once again, she's royalty, she happens to be the daughter's chief and her dream is to go sailing and discover the other side of the world. Yes, for some reasons later revealed but without being too satisfying, the entire village is stuck on the little island planting coconuts, eating coconuts and singing about how much they love coconuts. No problem, I love coconuts too. But I prefer fish.Some back-story is provided through another ominous legend about a mysterious heart being stolen from the local Goddess allowing a semi-god named Maui to create the human race, the animation was cool and didn't really cut-and-paste something from Disney movies but it still reminded me of ""Kung Fu Panda""... sorry, nothing new again. But even by accepting magic as an obligatory narrative trope in animated movies, I was wondering why is it that most girl-power movies must rely so much on the supernatural. Think about it, whether for Elsa, Moana or even Rey from ""Star Wars"", there's always an element of magic that undermines the idea of a girl or a woman singlehandedly triumphing over the obstacles or despite her weaknesses. Minimizing the help of people or even animal sidekicks, these new trendy heroines most often rely on the assistance of magic, which doesn't really highlight their efforts or their merits. In ""Moana"", the interference of magical waves or reincarnations or any superpowers from Maui are so numerous that the film loses its capability to thrill you, when you get used to these magic ex machina moment, you stop considering any danger a real threat, andthat's a threat for enjoyment.Now, I know the film is another instance of a movie teaching children, but especially girls, that they have to find themselves and have the courage to challenge unfair rules. Fair enough, but how can someone who's the ""chosen one"" ever find herself? Basically, she'll have to find what she was chosen for. By trying to play on every possible safe side, the film never finds its places and ends up delivering more messages than Western Union. And these messages don't necessarily speak the truest statements about life, if you're going to convince children that everything is possible if you put your mind to it, you can't teach them that ""trying"" is the most important thing. How about a Disney movie where 'failure' can be an option? At least, they can try that with a male character if they're afraid of some backlash.To be fair about the movie, I enjoyed the visuals, but we know it's the common denominator of most Disney movies, even ""Finding Dory"" looked great, but the plot was rather thin. What's ""Moana"" got to offer? Sure, I loved the immersion into Hawaiian culture and traditions. It's true Moana succeeds in giving us a Hawaiian flavor from the start but for the most part, the film is an adventure above the sea which isn't the most original setting, and apart from the traditional songs (nothing new since ""The Lion King"") and the colorful look, we could have a movie set inside the island, giving much latitude to the Hawaiian tradition, instead of the usual ""native"" narrative defined in terms of unfair tradition, relationship with Mother Nature and a young daughter who wants to challenge. To be honest, this has become a bit too predictable and the film can only follow the same series of patterns. It becomes all a matter of ""posture"".Dwayne the Rock Johnson and Auli'lCaravalho provide the voices of the heroic pair, and as much as I loved their work, especially some singing moments, I was wondering why the 'Marketing' was so insistent on their background? So Dwayne, a native Samoan dubs the voice of Maui, and Caravalho is a true native. But was Disney afraid of being accused of vocal white-washing? Did Johnson have a Hawaiian accent? And would have accent been accepted or criticized for being too stereotypical? I don't know but I guess it's just to prevent some criticism, and they were certainly right. The film didn't even escape from controversy when they launched the 'Moana' costume. But I guess it shows that no matter how critical we are toward the film, it reacts properly to the mood of its era.Now, I'm looking forward to discovering ""Coco"". Finally a movie about a boy! Sorry, but since Disney is supposed to awaken an inner child, mine happens to be a boy and maybe this girl-power stuff is making the boy inside me feel more insecure or jealous. So I don't mind a girl power movie once in a while but in that case, I wish Disney could... let it go!"
125,Moana,7,18 December 2017,Disney goes far in 'Moana',"Disney Animation Studios has been on a hot streak for a number of years now, and 2016's 'Moana' was another example of how far the studio will go to release films that resonate with its audiences. While we are clearly beyond the days of the classic 2D animated movies that audiences of all ages fell in love with, 'Moana' proves it's possible to capture the magic of this era through quick wit, lots of laughs and, of course, catchy songs.The film follows the story of a young Polynesia princess who's forbidden from leaving her homeland - an island in the South Pacific. As is the case in most Disney pictures, the protagonist, Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), defies convention and embarks on a journey to find a demigod named Maui (Dwayne Johnson) so she can retrieve Te Fiti's heart, an ancient artifact that is needed to restore order to the open seas. This plot is nothing spectacular - it's pretty basic, but is in line with what's needed for a foundation of a great animated film.""Moana''s strengths are obvious. From the beautiful scenery brought to life through animation, where everything in nature appears to be alive - even the inanimate ocean, to the standard comedic moments that are expected in Disney movies (most of which come at the expense of Maui), there is plenty to enjoy about the film. The standout for sure is Cravalho, as her vocals are impressive on the soundtrack, including its biggest hit, ""How Far I'll Go."" As a heroine, Moana is fiercely independent and self-sufficient - a strong role model particularly for young girls. The only areas that feel a bit lacking are the few number of characters - much less compared to traditional Disney movies - and the fact that there is no traditional villain (think Jafar, Cruella de Vil, Scar, etc,). That said, there's plenty of action and adventure to keep audiences engaged.While not the most memorable story, 'Moana' is a fun, free-spirited adventure and is an example of how Disney is continuing to explore new areas while working with a proven formula for success."
126,Moana,7,18 December 2017,"Not the Disney Experience I had Hoped for, but Entertaining Nonetheless,","Moana is a good movie with a well written plot and a terrific vocal cast. It is an entertaining Disney film that boasts plenty of highly enjoyable, as well as catchy, musical numbers that make the movie shine, particularly How Far I'll Go and You're Welcome. The voice cast is also terrific, with Hollywood star Dwayne Johnson really shining in this role, and newcomer Auli'i Cravalho really owning a huge, challenging character. I did feel that the film lacked originality. I did not see anything here that I have not already seen in other Disney princess films, it follows the exact same story beats as the other movies, without doing anything extraordinary or unconventional to make up for this. As well as that, the story never truly pulled me in, while films such as Mulan and Tangled really gripped me, there was never a moment where I felt truly engrossed with this plot. I had to really try to watch it rather than being taken away. Reasonable Disney fun. While it is not what I had hoped for, Moana is still certainly an enjoyable 90 minutes that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good family film. A young Hawaiian must seek out and find a Demigod in order to bring peace to her island."
127,Moana,10,18 December 2017,Just the best!!!,"I love everything about this movie. The colors, the setting and the characters, all good to my eyes!"
128,Moana,7,17 December 2017,Some problems in the presentation but overall a solid Disney film,"The qualities of Disney films that most people like are sustained in 'Moana' and generally presented with great skill and wit. Auli'i Cravalho handles her debut role excellently, and Dwayne Johnson makes a much better voice actor than I expected. The setting of 'Moana' is fresh and seems to be arranged with integrity and a genuine interest. My only substantial complaint about this film is that the distribution of songs seems somewhat inconsistent, dominating the first half to the extent that the narrative isn't as easily followed as it should be; the world of 'Moana' is harder to break into than those of 'Frozen' and the other recent, memorable Disney films, and so the directors probably should have taken a little more time to explain it to the audience before we hear half a dozen songs. The good in 'Moana' definitely outweighs the bad, though, and my 7/10 rating *almost* became an 8/10."
129,Moana,8,20 November 2017,"This may actually be too complex for children, but they sure enjoy it!","Moana is the story of a teenage girl living in Oceanic dreamtime who, on the advice of her grandmother, runs away from home, takes up with a strange mostly-naked man, and drops a rock down a volcano.Moana is also the story of a teenage girl living in Oceanic dreamtime who discovers women's power in response to men's fear. A male thief greedily and thoughtlessly steals a token of female power and thus begins the destruction of the world. A young woman, with the support of feminine archetypes, restores the power of creation to the female breast where it belongs.There is no princess, though the heroine is the daughter of a chief. There is no romance; the male lead is a trickster whose self-interest supersedes all. The eerily intelligent animal sidekicks are relegated to the background, and there is even a self-aware joke on how we eat our animal friends.It's a form of the Hero's Journey, of course, but there is also a complex discussion of personal and group identity, responsibility to one's community versus one's responsibility to oneself, and the ethical ramifications of following one's {dreams|heart|goals|responsibilities} through, even when they conflict with the goals or needs of the group or the other. It starts with the heroine being told who she is, and where she is, and where she belongs, that there is no appeal, and there is no other option. Interestingly, as she initially accepts her manufactured identity and role in the community, that very acceptance requires that she reject her community's definition of who she is to go on the Hero's Journey, discover who she *really* is, proclaim it to the world, and take action based on that true identity. She can thus uncover the true needs of both her gods and her community, successfully fulfill those needs, and help them integrate their new true identities with their previous image of Who We Are.This is no boilerplate Disney spectacle; this is a story based on Tahitian and Maori mythology. There is bad; a fair amount of probably accidental racism that could have been avoided with better cultural advisers, and an incorrect presentation of the trickster deity's physical appearance that perpetuates a generally false image of weight and bulk in Oceanic males (though the actual lithe teenage boy appearance from myth would open a whole new can of worms, stuck out in the ocean with the lithe teenage girl as they were). But the good far outweighs the bad, and the voyager sequence alone is worth the price of admission. Plus, the way Maui, Shapeshifter, Demigod of the Wind and Sea, Hero of Men (and Women) screams when he sees that little girl for the first time is pretty funny. And you have to picture Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson doing the ""You're Welcome"" song and dance, because that's also pretty funny. And there are two pee jokes.If you must watch one movie a thousand times because you have children, this is a good one to choose."
130,Moana,5,8 November 2017,Quite weak despite an excellent animation,"Quite weak despite an excellent animation.This movie would have been an opportunity to set a monument for the remarkable polynesian expansion over vast areas of the Pacific. Pre-columbian and pre-Portuguese, no sextants etc. and indeed a stellar achievement of sailing and navigation. This context somehow is almost completely lost in this lame story, reduced to a fairy tale set in the South Seas without much local atmosphere in terms of narration. Just using an outrigger canoe as major focus in this animation is not enough. Also the soliciting topic of the search of the unknown remains mostly unused in this movie in fact. A wasted opportunity."
131,Moana,10,23 October 2017,The best movie I ever seen,hello! I think Disney is very invested in this movie is one of my favorites. I really liked the idea and this is not an ordinary Princess And the stigma that someone should save Moana. I actually really like the song of Maui is so funny and cute and i think it Must be more films like Moana with a message and also I really like the player Dwayne Johnson so i am really happy that he dubbed this film and really like your article!!!!
132,Moana,10,28 September 2017,Killed it!,"It was an excellent movie with an excellent soundtrack, it pretty much had an excellent everything. Moana really doesn't disappoint it has a good pacing, an amazing cast, and it is outstanding. that sentence alone could summarise this entire review, but hey that's rather stingy for something I thought was brilliant. Moana is a story that takes place in Ancient Polynesia, when a curse reaches the island Mata Nui a chiefs daughter (Moana) is determined to venture beyond the reef, to find a demigod named Maui in order to stop the curse. Like most Disney movies this is a coming of age story as Moana is being pulled in two separate directions in one she is to become the next Chief of the village however she is struggling to love her people and make them the priority in her life while also being pulled in the direction of her beloved ocean that chose her as a child. Moana is joined by a demigod named Maui. He starts out as a very self loving and humorous character but we quickly learn why and see him change for the better. The classical three-act-structure that is the main convention in every film possibly ever made. Moana has a great beginning, good middle, and a great ending. The cinematography was beautiful it really shows that the creators have done their research as the island was point perfect of every detail, this just creates a whole new experience for the audience as we are not having to imagine what it actually looks like we are able to see exactly what it looks like right in front of us.

133,Moana,7,11 September 2017,Could have been better,"I was watching waiting for conversations but all I get is singing. Ninety percent of the movie is singing. I think it will be better with more conversation, so it won't look like a mash up between Barbie the Island Princess with Disney.Graphic and plot were superb. Surpasses Rise of the Guardians or equal with it. I find myself enjoying the movie. And that tells how good it was.Sure there were boring moments, such as the part where they were attempting to get Maui's weapon, but that's only my opinion.Not as good as How to Train your Dragon.7.9 mostly from graphic and enjoyment."
134,Moana,9,22 November 2016,The best Disney Animated Movie I have seen in a while!,"This week we were given the opportunity to attend an advanced screening of Disney's newest film ""Moana"".What we loved about the film:The cast is incredible! Auli'i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson are wonderful and you can feel the pride in their voices as they represent their Hawaiian culture - as well as doing justice in serving several other cultures of Oceania throughout this film. They are also supported by the talents of so many others including Jemaine Clement, Temura Morrison, and Nicole Scherzinger.I love the family connections.The connection between Moana and her Grandma Tala was one I really felt strongly in my heart. Her mother understanding that she needed to go even though her father didn't approve. Her father welcoming her home with open arms even though she went against his wishes. It was all really powerful. A wonderful message of encouragement and forgiveness. She is also lifted up as a leader. She is given the chance to make decisions for her people. They trust her. It was incredible and wonderful!The soundtrack is incredible! ""Moana"" features original songs from a team that includes Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foaʻi. My husband isn't a great fan of ""all of the singing"" (not a musical theater kind of guy) but even he said this music was pretty good. The chicken, Hei Hei, is hilarious and wonderful. As my husband says, ""stupid chicken jokes just never get old"". It was serious comic relief and we all decided he was probably our favorite part of this movie. The Ocean also plays a huge role in the film and brought humor as well as empathy and you see the relationship build as the movie goes on.Moana is an incredibly strong main character and young woman. She is not a princess - she says this in the film. This didn't feel like a princess movie to me, which I was so grateful for. I have struggled through several of them lately - just never been a ""princess"" person. That said Princess lovers will not be disappointed. Moana is a leader. She is a voyager. She is a hero. She is what every girl should aspire to! She is what I aspire to be! There is no love story here - other than her love of the ocean, nature, her family, her people, and eventually herself. She saved as much as she was saved and I found that so refreshing! She is fiercely independent and supported by all of the women in her life. She becomes a hero by learning and being open to situations. She thinks things through and problem solves. She is a force, yet is gentle and understanding and with all of these traits you fall in love with her and cheer her on. She has moments of weakness and finds the strength to overcome them.I love that she looks like a real person proportionally. She is thin, but isn't rail thin like all of the princesses. I felt like I was looking at a real person rather than a stick figure that could easily be snapped in two. Thank you for that Disney!The message of trying to save our oceans and earth is strong and wonderful. I also love the idea that the ocean doesn't separate us, but connects us. That is so powerful and if we thought like this more I think greater respect would be paid to one of the biggest givers of life our planet has. I love the cultural message that ties several of the cultures throughout the Pacific together in this film. It was really lovely too. Disney and the film makers traveled to several island nations to bring Oceania's legends to life in this film. They share their rich oral histories as well as the traits the people have used for centuries. Moana's main outfit was designed so it would be suitable for an adventurer. Neysa Bové, the costume designer made sure the skirt has a slit in front to allow movement whether she's swimming, running or navigating her canoe. So much thought was put into the development.We highly recommend this film! My son says, ""boys will really like it a lot because it isn't a princess movie and there is plenty of action plus the chicken is so funny"". I say moms and dads will like it a lot because it is funny, there are several great messages, and it has a little something for everyone! In my opinion this is one of the best Disney animated films I have seen in a while."
135,Moana,7,6 December 2016,"Same Tropes, New Skin, I'll Take It","After nearly eighty years, you would think some aspiring film critic would developed a comprehensive criteria for Disney movies. Imagine the man hours saved. I could call my grandmother, put sandbags by a raging river, or perform some other generic contribution to society. Instead, I am typing this review six people will read. The decisions we make.Moana is the latest product of the patented Disney formula. The general rub: Moana Waialiki (Cravalho), daughter of an ancient Polynesian chief, is torn between her responsibilities as heir and her desire to explore the perilous ocean. Encourage by her Gramma, Moana must embrace ancestral tradition by traversing the ocean in search of demigod Maui (Johnson). Together, they must battle Gods and other foes* in order to restore the heart of the sea to the mother goddess, Te Fiti.Moana is new age Disney. Strong, independent, competent ""princess"" with no romantic interests. Recent development, already stale. For comparison, Moana's broad concept is identical to Pixar's Brave. Parental figure pushes the responsibilities of lineage, heroine drawn to broader aspects of the culture. Moana is the same song and dance sans Scotsman. Still, the irrefutable truth remains: the formula works. Moana might lack the original spark crucial to join the pantheon of all time Disney films, but the solid storytelling and fresh Polynesian skin make it an easy recommendation.Disney is always willing to devote the time, money, and talent to dominate animation. Like most Disney features, Moana spent years and years in preproduction. Furthermore, the team has enough experience to meet challenges like water, hair, and even Maui's moving body tattoos creatively. The directors, voice actors, composer, head animators, all were on location in search of inspiration. Did they get a sweet Pacific island vacation out of the deal? For sure. But they also got details. The ships, village buildings, navigation technique, most viewers never question or notice these details, but their cumulative impact creates an immersive world. Consulting with experts also keeps the mythos honest. In Moana, creative liberties are blended to be indistinguishable from folklore. Well, mostly.** Still, Some people are going to complain about cultural insensitivity no matter what. I am not an expert, but ostensibly Disney has done their due diligence. The most common complaint is Maui's body type. Many claim his obesity is an offensive stereotype. If Maui is obese then I want to be obese. Dude is swole. I don't want to live in a theater where every character is a generic supermodel.The characters are not quite as on point. Moana is what you would expect. Always rocking the confident façade. Secretly vulnerable because she question her ability to live up to her fate. You get the picture. Kind, but stifling father. Independent, wild, grandma encouraging her to rebel. Yada Yada. Maui is the real deal. This trickster demigod is silly, clever, and arrogant. But due to his backstory, he is also harboring helplessness, in parallel with his newfound buddy Moana. Side characters are a mix. There is a eccentric chicken that gets a laugh with every appearance. The pig on the poster, well, Disney punted away millions in merchandising. I went to a preview on Moana and this guy got the best reaction because he is the cutest creature ever. Only in the movie for two minutes. Most interesting is The Ocean. Now the ocean is plays a vital role in Polynesian culture and the film, but The Ocean is an enigma. Think the alien from The Abyss. Moana first encounters The Ocean as a child. They play and The Ocean gives her the heart of the sea. Henceforth, Moana is always drawn to the ocean. I do not understand why avatar had to be a character. Being drawn to the sea is a commonality between people consistent throughout time and geography. Why Moana needs her personal Ocean is lost on me. She already has the weight of her ancestors and Gramma as enough of a reason to set sail. This character only exists to put Moana back in the boat when Maui throws her off.Last side note, the music. I doubt anyone is going to be singing songs from Moana five years from now. Most memorable is Lin-Manuel Miranda's ode to glam rock, Shiny. I love it, but it's a bit too kooky and plot specific for mass appeal. It's only been a few days and I have already forgotten most of the main theme, but Maui's You're Welcome might endure. The chorus is catchy and the unrestrained arrogance is adorable. Did Let it Go become a sensation immediately? Maybe I will look the fool for this prediction, but I sense no hits here.Ugh. This review got a bit long. I guess I felt the need to pontificate because within the Disney paradigm Moana is just middling. Are you sick of Disney storytelling? I have no argument to convince you that Moana is worth your time.*** But I'm not weary of Disney, and sighs indicate I am part of the majority. *Coconut Pirates**Coconut Pirates*** Other than the Coconut Pirates"
136,Moana,9,13 December 2016,"When it comes to sheer entertainment value and visual beauty, 'Moana' knocks it out of the park","Despite being a lifelong Disney fan, that is not to say that everything they've done is great. They've done many classics, their best revolutionary, though they had hit and miss periods in the 80s and the 2000s.'Enchanted' and 'The Princess and the Frog' saw a return to form, while the likes of 'Tangled', 'Wreck It Ralph', 'Zootropolis' (aka 'Zootopia') and 'Frozen' were even better and there was a lot to like too about 'Big Hero 6'. Of the ""2nd Renaissance""/""Disney Revival"" period, 'Moana' is up there with the best of them and as one of Disney's best in about twenty years.Maybe the momentum dips ever so slightly going into the final act, Maui's change of heart is a touch rushed and for me there was no real point to the pig character that induced more unintentional awkwardness than amusement. It was however difficult to fault 'Moana', because of how many things it did right and how brilliantly the things it did right were executed. There have been criticisms regarding a formulaic story, HeiHei the chicken being irritating and the portrayal of Maui being stereotypical, but these were criticisms that didn't bother me at all.Firstly, the animation is phenomenal. Disney's best-looking film in a long time and one of their best-ever looking films, not just this but perhaps the most visually exquisite animated film this year in a year that also saw 'Your Name', 'Kubo' and 'Zootropolis' and even one of the year's best-looking films. The attention to detail is impossible to fault, whether it's the water, the trees or even Maui's tattoos, while the colours just pop out at you and everything is immaculately detailed with not an ounce of artificiality in the backgrounds, further boasting visually stunning sequences such as the climax, ""We Know the Way"", ""Shiny"" and with the coconut pirates.The soundtrack has garnered a huge amount of praise, and for good reason. Love the evocative orchestration and instrumentation, with its seamless blend of South Pacific Culture, pop and Broadway. Likewise with the songs, which are along with 'Frozen' the best and most consistent set of songs from a Disney film since 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'. ""How Far I'll Go"" is an ""I want"" sort of song that's infectious, heartfelt and inspiring. ""You're Welcome"" sees Dwayne Johnson showing a quite wide range of emotions through a surprisingly good singing voice. ""Shiny"" is deliciously kooky and like something that David Bowie would be proud of, Jemaine Clement sings the heck out of it. ""We Know the Way"" sends chills up the spine.Scripting-wise, 'Moana' encompassed a wide emotional range within me. There is something for everybody, never too complicated for children and never too childish for adults, tonally it's focused throughout, and it's very witty and thought-provoking. Throughout there are many opportunities to laugh, cry and be inspired. The story is, while not exactly original, beautifully paced and enthralling.The whole Polynesian culture, faith and seafaring traditions included and explored generously but in a way that feels part of the story rather than just thrown in, and while there are elements that reminds one of Disney past and present this feels more affectionate than Disney just running out of ideas. The coconut pirates scene may seem like filler, but instead of being incidental and dull filler it was entertaining and visually dazzling, while the musical numbers bring the storytelling forward and say much about the characters' motivations and the climax is hair-raising.Moana is has now joined the list as one of my favourite female Disney characters, while Maui is a fun, compelling character and the chemistry between the two being a large part of the film's humour and heart. Personally found myself entertained by HeiHei and that his existence and role in the story were justified. If anybody does find him dumb or annoying, this is a rare of those not being bad things for a character clearly intended to be that way from reading up about the film. The voice acting is top notch, with Auli'i Cravalho making a startling debut (voice and singing, goodness she has pipes). Dwayne Johnson, on paper an unlikely and eyebrow-inducing choice, is also splendid, as an actor he's grown a lot, while Alan Tudyk is amusingly zesty and Jemaine Clement bringing gleefully kooky menace.In summary, knocks it out of the park in visual beauty and sheer entertainment value, Disney does it again with their latest classic 'Moana'. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
137,Moana,,4 December 2016,Giving back,"From the minds of 'The princess & the frog', 'Aladdin' & 'Hercules', among others, this is quite an experience for an animated movie that sadly fell apart on reflection. Make no mistake, this is pure entertainment for all ages, especially the beginning part with little Moana, her namesake supporter, & her grandma, but all of that only lasts for the duration of the movie. Works best if you do not look for reasons to various occurrences in the events that transpire over its runtime. 'You're welcome' was a royal hoot, and I did enjoy both renderings of the song. Wasn't very fond of the cliché-ridden plot line though, & there are plenty of examples where I thought the movie could have used fresh ideas, especially during the writing stage/phase of the flick. Disney sure dropped the ball, imho, on this one. The 3D rendering is gorgeous, and a Real D 3D viewing experience is a must (if not IMAX 3D). Surprisingly, Dwayne Johnson's voice is not a distraction at all, and his voice-casting is as apt as Jermaine Clement's voice-casting as the middle-person crab. The characters playing the lead's sidekicks (2) should have had more runtime, imho, along with the segment with the younger version of the lead. Not enough at all. Quite possibly few of the best sequences occur with them in tow. Along with the sequences with the crab, the ones in the cave, and 1 on the island, but, imho, the movie peaked early, and underwhelms towards the end. This kind of a problem has afflicted other better movies, & I, for one, feel that these kind of problems need to be visualized at the scripting stage (I'm sure they were, just not sure about the extent to which it was done, or about the final sign-off from the execs) itself, considering the amount of time that is spent on these productions. Another recent movie, 'Dear Zindagi', did not have a 'hook' compelling enough for someone like me to invest in the fate of the lead characters, & though this one does not falter as much as that one did, it sure comes close. Worth 1 viewing. Decent, but way short of greatness, in spite of the potential it had to be another 'Frozen' or a 'Big Hero 6'."
138,Moana,,23 January 2017,If only for the songs...,"..the songs alone made this movie very enjoyable for me. Most people say typical Disney crap. To which I say, we all know that. So why even bother? Well, the music alone are very witty and catchy. I don't know since when have I seen this type, Mulan maybe? (No Frozen don't count because the songs there aren't that catchy. To my taste at least. Again, to my taste only lest I be swarmed with hate mails from Frozen fanatics).The story, well, yeah its typical but not poorly executed. Its our usual lead saves the world by believing in her heart bla bla bla. But for kids, and with kids at heart, the execution alone made you forget about the predictability of the story we've seen in almost all animated movies. So what gives this movie edge is the songs that were all good and pleasing to the ears. Another reason why this movie was good is the presence of the character of the demi-god Maui. He's witty, funny, and that's what brought life to the otherwise boring party. The only ""cheesy"" part I couldn't handle is the end of the battle with the villain. That part where she sang her way to victory. If you've seen the film, you'll understand this. Other than that, everything was fine."
139,Moana,9,31 December 2016,Another outstanding entry in the ever-improving Walt Disney Animation Studios,"After Zootopia in March, I was very excited for this one. It exceeded my expectations by being more than just an average ""hero's journey"" flick. The music is excellent, and the titular protagonist is very human. This movie shows how far Disney has come, and I am glad to say that they no longer stand in Pixar's shadow. I instantly fell in love with this film, and will definitely re-watch it. Although it may seem like the typical ""hero's journey"" I mentioned before, this movie is very different. It is surprising. It is inspiring and powerful. I found nothing wrong with this movie. It is a must-watch and is further proof that Disney movies are continuing to get better.First of all, the music (composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda of Hamilton fame) is incredible, consisting of sing-along songs that could easily compete with the ones in Frozen. The performances, especially by The Rock and newcomer Auli'i Cravalho are amazing, although some may not be happy with the American accents. The animation is absolutely gorgeous, beautifully detailed, and a joy to look at. The story has more depth than what I've come to expect.Although some people may note the faults with the portrayal of Polynesian culture, you can easily overlook this and appreciate Disney for recognizing it in the first place. Unless you are truly tired of Disney's formula, go out and see Moana."
140,Moana,,18 March 2017,Not a Disney Flick.Kinda boring.,The movie is okish.The sea is beautiful.The girl is cute.Except that its nothing.demi god is boring and his tattoo is double boring. the chicken is worst of all.not funny at all.the songs are not catchy as in tangled where the song blends with the movie.Please don't waste your time watching this thing.
141,Moana,9,15 March 2017,Fun follow-your-dreams-empowerment Disney adventure flick,"Disney princesses have changed a lot since the company started pumping them out. In the case of Moana, the daughter of a village chieftain is strong, brave, athletic, and determined to save the world. She also denies being a princess altogether, although in one of the film's occasional Disney in-jokes she is told that if you've got a dress and an animal sidekick, you're a princess.The movie fits very much in the girl-empowerment ethos that has replaced Disney's original waiting-for-the-princess trope. This is very much a heroic, mythic adventure story. It's also quite funny, with a brash demigod, a cheeky ocean, and the world's dumbest rooster all doing their shtick. The songs are decent. There's a nice please-nominate-me-for-an-Oscar empowerment song that's kind of catchy, a rousing number involving sailing ships, and the best, a David Bowiesque thing called Shiny. It's not the best Disney soundtrack, but it's a pretty good one.The animation is gorgeous. At least on television, a good deal of the scenery looked photo-realistic, and the island setting allowed for a lot of natural beauty. There are also notable sequences involving living tattoos that were apparently hand drawn.Well worth watching."
142,Moana,6,24 February 2017,Remember Brave?,"Me neither, and i will forget this movie soon as well.The movie is colorful and it has a somewhat catchy song but everything else about it is sub-par. The majority of the music is bland, the animal sidekick is overly pointless, the ""hero"" is a very bad Han Solo and this movie will quickly be forgotten.I managed to peg Disney's Frozen movie right on the nose that it was an OK movie but that the song was catchy enough to become a hit, nothing is certain but this movie is trying to hard without taking any risks.Some further problems are that the facial animations are sometimes a little off, there are no real stakes since the undefined power of the ocean is a deus ex machina that has carte blanche to do whatever it wants when it feels like it without any in-universe limitations."
143,Moana,7,9 January 2017,A typical Disney princess story without the prince...,"Disney did it again, an amended princess story. Queuing into the load of critics, I may not add spectacular insights, but summarize my opinion for those who are undecided to see Moana in the cinema or not.Let's keep it short and simple. Moana (Vaiana in Austria and Germany) starts a world rescue mission within her mythical world of Maoris and Oceania in the best possible way. Disobeying her father the chief she starts a visually beautiful journey to help her people with the support of a likable demigod, sweet or funny sidekicks and not always comprehensible reasons within the story. As usual, the ""princess"" of the island sings her way through mythical creatures and magic tricks. So far so good, but unfortunately nothing new.Let's take the ocean scenario away and agree on the key argument the creators spread in every interview, namely there is no romance as main motivation. OK, that's fine, but still I have seen this story a dozen times.What does it mean for you? Just that you see Merida, Arielle or what have you in a new disguise. New but similar songs, new but similar characters and new but similar characters. It's up to you to decide if you prefer sailing between the islands or riding a horse in the Scottish highlands. So Moana is a well-made, funny and nice feel good movie, but nothing you don't know yet.As a result, decide on the trailer. Do you like the scenario, then go for it but don't expect a big Disney surprise."
144,Moana,9,12 December 2016,Never trust a big crustacean's impatience,"If Frozen was Disney's (anti-traditional)wedding film - anchoring a snarky, tongue-in-cheek ill-advised pairing with family drama, dubiously scheming relations, anxiety, and outbursts of repressed ice powers (what - what was your wedding like?) - Moana is the perfect Honeymoon, and ideal palate cleanser for a generation of preschoolers who just won't Let It Go. Fittingly, amidst the tropical paradise trappings, it's also a film with classicism on the brain, recruiting veteran The Little Mermaid directors Ron Clements and Don Hall for such a grand, old-fashioned seafaring 'hero's journey' Disney film you practically expect Moana to wave to Timon and Pumba along the way. It's telling that Moana is narratively rooted in the tension between respecting tradition and individualism, as the film plays like a tapestry of the greatest hits of where Disney has gone, while leaning towards frontiers it hopes to continue to push. And if Moana, one of the most lushly emotive, visually jaw-dropping, and inventively fun releases, not just for 'Modern Disney' but 'All-Time Disney,' the House of Mouse is in no danger of losing its mojo for untold years to come. There's a comforting simplicity in Moana's three-act structure, but it's a familiar enough setup to momentarily risk getting too caught up tracking allusions to past Disney hits (Pocahontas' restless individualism in the face of tradition and environmental subtext; Hercules' moving artwork as surrogate Jiminy Cricket 'conscious', and so on) to follow the unfurling plot. Still, Clements and Hall attack it with gusto, and an almost primal resonance and depth of feeling that's a welcome callback to Ye Olde Disney Classics. If Disney has one overarching theme throughout its oeuvre, it's dissatisfaction with the status quo, and Moana (newcomer Auli'i Cravalho; luminously charismatic, and an almost eerily emotive singer)'s quarantine on her seemingly idyllic island paradise, taunted by the inaccessible sea she yearns to explore, each refrain of expositional tune Where You Are quickly becomes almost noxiously claustrophobic. Thankfully, the anthropomorphic sea and Moana's wacky- but-wise grandmother (Rachel House's creaky affectations, perfectly creased with heart) have other ideas - there's destiny afoot, and no time to waste. As such, there's an almost tangible feeling of cathartic release when she finally Lets It G-ahem-bursts out to the sea, joining up with rambunctiously boastful demigod Maui (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, whose oaken tones impart an exquisitely larger-than-life playfulness) for a buddy-cop road trip steeped in carefully reverent Polynesian mythology. Their adventures are fun, but fairly rote and episodic, but we're still in 'Love Is An Open Door' meta-Disney mode here, and Clements and Hall are careful to pivot whenever cliché threatens to encroach. Here, the plucky, confident yet quirkily neurotic titular 'don't-call-her-a-princess' realizes the best way to honour her ancestral traditions is to seemingly rebel against them, the blowhard Maui is lent a deceptively downbeat backstory, and there's not a whiff of a romantic subplot to stifle the fun. Instead, we plunge full steam ahead into a sublimely bonkers Mad Max homage chase with a murderous band of coconut pirates, a (sadly rushed) foray into an under- underwater Land of the Monsters, headlined by treasure-encrusted-crustacean Tamatoa (the effervescently witty Jemaine Clement, having a ball camping up his David Bowie-spoofing glam rock crab - geddit?). Eventually, the plot cascades into a showdown with a gigantic lava monster, which subverts expectations by poignantly furthering Disney's recent trend in unorthodox, nonviolent climax resolution (see also: Marvel's Doctor Strange). Moana's power ballad is 'How Far I'll Go,' and Clements and Hall certainly take her at her word. Still, Moana truly reaches the realm of the greats as an almost flawlessly dazzling sensory experience. Showcasing arguable some of the most gorgeous animation ever to cross the silver screen, Moana dazzles in details grand and small, from the flecks of flame dribbling off the immense lava monster sizzling into the sea, from the breeze rustling through the coconut trees on Moana's home island, to Moana's grandmother's spirit gliding through the ocean like a spectral manta ray, only to soar into the sky, crashing into the constellations. The sentient ocean alone allows for a treasure trove of outstanding visuals - the money shot is its introduction, parting itself (take that, Moses) to create an ensconcing aquarium wall around toddler Moana, though if you've ever wondered what a wave cocking its head incredulously would look like, now you know. Matching the sumptuous visuals head on is the gorgeous music, including the movingly earthy melodies of Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa'i, and the breathlessly nimble wordplay of Hamilton scribe Lin-Manuel Miranda, make Moana's soundtrack immediately rank among the most infectiously earwormy Disney tunes of all time. Tamatoa's setpiece alone is an unforgettable masterclass of sight and sound, as the humongous bejewelled crab turns into a bioluminescent disco ball, battering Maui while simultaneously poking at the film's 'love yourself' theme. Did I mention he rhymes 'demigod' with 'decapod' (look it up)? You don't see that in The Secret Life of Pets. It may toe the line of over-familiar for some more jaded viewers, and it's less character-driven than recent compatriots Frozen and Zootopia, but Moana is still practically bursting with abiding excellence. Visually sumptuous, musically magnificent, neatly sidestepping pitfalls of convention, and lent a uniquely wacky charisma by the superb cast, Disney continues to push the envelope for considerate and mature storytelling - kid-appropriate, but also surprisingly resonant for the parents discreetly wiping aside tears beside them. All this, and Alan Tudyk cameos through the clucks of an impossibly stupid comic relief rooster. Is it any wonder the film's catchiest tune is simply titled 'You're Welcome'? -9.5/10"
145,Moana,9,19 December 2016,A Fantastic Disney Princess Movie,"So--full disclosure: ""Moana"" is one of the few Disney ""princess"" movies that I've actually seen. That being the case, I really don't have a lot to compare this movie to, at least in terms of how she stacks up to other Disney-produced female leads. What I can say, though, is that as someone who is a fan of movies in general, this was a fantastic movie!One thing you can expect from this movie is that it follows a tried and true formula of the heroine going on an adventure, having to defeat an evil antagonist, and there being lots of kid-friendly singing along the way. The movie nevertheless takes on this task in a way that feels fresh and welcoming, by telling the story of an island girl whose tale incorporates her tribe's ancient mythology into the adventure.All in all I'm giving this movie 9/10 stars. It's fantastic, but just a tad bit shy of a perfect rating. Perhaps a bit less song and dance would have made it a perfect 10 for me. Still, a fantastic movie through and through."
146,Moana,8,24 November 2016,In the Upper Half of Disney Classics..,"Witnessing the birth of a new Disney princess is exciting. But when it's paired with a well executed ""good Disney film formula"", you have something beautiful. Which is the fairest word I can describe this film with. It's quite unfair to review a Disney film the same way you review any other film. One must review each aspect of the formula that were binded together to create the emotional Disney experience.1- The Princess : Moana is your typical modern day Disney princess even if she doesn't look like one. She's the curious, kind and courageous girl that wants to break free and defy her parents to seek something she's been longing for. 2- Music / an original catchy song : The Music in Moana was my first Lin Miranda experience. And I Loved it! . Some may disagree, but the music throughout this film was superb and in my opinion, the best aspect of it. We'll definitely be hearing ""How Far I'll Go"" everywhere in the next few months. So cover your ears if you don't want to hate it. It will probably snatch best original song from Zootopia's ""Try Everything"" as well.3- The plot/conflict : Moana, with the help of the demigod Maui, sails on a journey to return the heart of Ti-Fiti in order to stop the corruption that has spread across the ocean and destroyed nearby islands. For a Disney film plots are one of the last things you remember. Since it's all about the experience this plot is simple and does the job.4- The Prince or Male Character : When I saw a couple of Maui scenes in the trailers I thought they were a bit forced. But I'm glad I was proved wrong. His jokes no matter how cheesy they might sound work great in the film. Much of that is thanks to Dwayne Johnson's excellent performance.. Maui grows on you as a character, and has great chemistry with Moana. I could watch them conversing on a boat for hours.5- Animal Side Kick : If you know some of the basic chicken behaviors, you are in for a treat. The chicken side kick in this film has some of the funniest scenes. They were well timed and simply creative. 6- The CG and Animation : If I write down every synonym for beautiful, It won't be enough to describe how gorgeous the CG and Animation was in this film. It's amazing to see how it has evolved throughout the years.7- The journey : This is undoubtedly the hardest part to execute. especially when you have a dozen of writers working together. For Moana this was executed well. Usually the parts or sequences that drag an Animated Film down reside in the third act. But for Moana, The third act was my favorite part of the film. There were a couple of sequences in the first half involving ""pirates"" and a crab monster that personally felt unnecessary . I'm sure some would enjoy them more though.Overall this film is gladly what I expected it to be. A Disney Classic. It might not be as timeless as Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella. But It surely is a great addition to the collection and a perfect Thanksgiving Cinema Experience."
147,Moana,8,4 December 2016,Another heartwarming film from Walt Disney Animation Studios.,"Moana is a movie set in Polynesia. Moana(Auli'i Cravalho) is the daughter of an island chieftain. A dastardly curse caused by demigod Maui(Dwayne Johnson), affects Moana's island. Now, it is up to Moana to find Maui & make sure that he corrects his mistake, before it's too late. Moana is a brilliant movie. The animation is gorgeous & all the locales in the film, look very life-like. The 3D gets you more involved in the proceedings on screen. All the songs in the movie are melodious & foot-tapping. This film is more funny than Zootopia(2016), which is the other movie released by Walt Disney Animation Studios, this year. Zootopia(2016) is more unique. However, this film has more heart & humor. The voice-over work by the cast is phenomenal. Auli'i Cravalho is outstanding as Moana. Cravalho gets across a number of emotions with her voice & sings, flawlessly. Dwayne Johnson is spectacular as Maui. The witty banter exchanged between Auli'i Cravalho's character & Dwayne Johnson's character is the highlight of the film. Rachel House is great as Gramma Tala. Temuera Morrison is awesome as Chief Tui. Jemaine Clement is impressive as Tamatoa. Nicole Scherzinger is good as Sina. Alan Tudyk is hysterical as Heihei. Don't miss the Disney animated short movie Inner Workings(2016) which is shown before the feature film, as it is amazing. Moana is an excellent movie, with lots of music, action, humor, heart & a beautiful message. Watch it with your entire family."
148,Moana,8,3 December 2016,A perfection of the formula for a Disney classic.,"Disney's ""Moana"" is their first musical movie since Frozen, and so they had to show they still had potential in regards to making meaningful movies for all ages. Moana is the perfect successor to Frozen's success. Yet, originality should be the most influential factor of a Disney movie, and Moana feels solely like a ""best bits"" compilation of it's older siblings.The storytelling found in Moana is almost a perfection of the formula Disney established alongside its ""Revival era"" back in 2009 with ""The Princess and the Frog"" and later movies. So, ultimately, the movie has a warm, familiar feeling to it that makes it instantly lovable. That said, it also means originality story line-wise is rare. You're given a similar protagonist to Rapunzel from Tangled, with similar deuteragonists to Hans from Frozen or Flynn Rider from Tangled. Many of the themes found in Moana are simple copy-and- pastes of other movies. Although I've seen many concepts in other Disney movies, that does not mean I don't like them. Disney used the best ideas from its predecessors in order to establish a perfect story line. You can really feel themes from movies like Mulan, The Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, Hercules, Frozen, Brother Bear and definitely Tangled appearing in Moana. I'm not expecting Disney to whip up a new 100%-successful formula for each Disney movie it creates. That wouldn't work. The only way art can progress is by building on what went right previously. It's like the natural selection of storytelling.On another note, the voice work in Moana is stunning. Bringing in such powerful (and arguably unqualified) voice actors was definitely a risk for Disney, and they knew that. Auli'i Cravalho has such a magnificent voice in regards to emotion in both speech and singing. Even at only 14 years old, she was an admirable and talented person. Dwayne Johnson was a surprise for me, as I truly didn't expect him to be as good as he was. I knew he could act, but to portray such emotion through his voice AND sing magnificently was the biggest plot twist.Speaking of singing, the soundtrack to Moana is beautiful in every way. Everyone expected a lot when they found out the writer of the songs behind the hit musical ""Hamilton"" was behind the soundtrack for the movie, and Moana does Miranda true justice. I went in blind by intentionally not listening to the soundtrack before watching, and I was so glad I chose to do that. Songs like ""How far I'll go"", ""We know the way"" and ""You're Welcome"" are amazing to listening to in true immersion for the first time. You get to appreciate them as storytelling devices before you get to hear them as well-written songs, and they are successful in both fields.The animation in Moana is simply beautiful. The hair on all characters really bounces and falls so satisfyingly, the sky and sea always maintain their beauty, and the movie's shots are all so artistic in both aesthetic and angle. The characters and scenes are rendered so well and look genuinely pleasing to the eye. Although, backgrounds and scenery arguably don't look as stunning as those in Pixar's ""The Good Dinosaur"" but this movie suits the more cartoon-y feel that it maintains.The characters in Moana are authentic in personality, such as their intentionally self-obsession or humbleness. They progress and develop to attach emotions for one another that you definitely respect as an audience. That said, many characters do not live up to their potential. Heihei the chicken contributes almost nothing to the story line of Moana other than to create a cheap laugh from the young children that may be bored. I feel like this was also done in movies like Brother Bear or Cinderella. One thing Frozen did so well was that its comic relief sidekick actually contributed to the plot by allowing the protagonist to learn something new that could help along the journey. Heihei doesn't do that. Moana's pig, Pua, starts off almost like a sidekick to Moana in the first 20 minutes, yet does not appear in the movie until the final 5 minutes. Pua had potential and could've been a friend to Moana on her journey like Pascal was to Rapunzel, or like Mushu and the Flea were to Mulan.Overall, Moana was definitely an amazing Disney classic, as it took what other movies did so well and squashed it into a new, fantastic movie. With stunning visuals, lovable characters, and catchy songs, Moana stands with the greats like Tangled, Aladdin, and Mulan."
149,Moana,1,16 March 2017,Blasphemous,"Its all about fake gods and weird spirit stuff. The girl disobeying her parents is a seen as a good thing in this movie. If you don't think these movies are trying to plant seeds your wrong. The underlying messages in this movie are anti Biblical. Any significance to her parting the water?? The Maui guy was human, but became a god? Disgusting."
150,Moana,8,23 March 2017,A well animated adventure with good music and beautiful scenery,"This movie has gone under-appreciated because it's compared to other Disney pictures. It's a traditional princess adventure, yes, we've seen it a million times, but if I wished to introduce a child to Disney this might be the first movie I would show them. After this, 'Aladdin'. Well of course if the child in question was like 5 years old then maybe I'd start with 'Dumbo' or 'The Jungle Book' or something but 'Moana' is pretty much the quintessential teen/pre-teen animated adventure.First of all, it's gorgeous. The Polynesian-like characters, the green tropical islands, the rafts and the clothes and the items, and above all the sea, the shining and flowing and glowing transparent water, all are utterly beautiful. It's the technically best-looking animated movie to date. (I added 'technically' because anime movies like 'The End of Evangelion' or 'The Tale of Princess Kaguya' achieve artistic imagery beyond anything any Disney adventure can offer.) Second, the songs are compelling. I've been listening to the soundtrack afterwards and every song has merit. 'Shiny' by Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords was unexpected and worked partly because of that, 'You're Welcome' is catchy and fun, and the others are emotional, full of bright-eyed wonder. Maybe when years go by I will grow sick and tired of 'How Far I'll Go' like everybody's grown sick and tired of 'Let It Go' but only time will tell. I don't think that will happen because 'How Far I'll Go' is shorter and it's reprised a couple of times so it's not such a perfect single, more like a piece of a musical than a self-contained hit.The story - well the story is about finding your place, dealing with expectations, breaking traditions and such. It works but is nothing groundbreaking. The jokes often fell flat, especially the dumb Twitter joke, but the physical comedy involving Maui was pretty hilarious. It was refreshing seeing the designated Disney Princess treated like that."
151,Moana,8,22 December 2016,Another Strong Contender for Best Animated Film of 2016,"Moana is a story about learning. Not Romance, not Adventure, not stopping evil people from doing evil things because they are evil. Just Learning. And that in a lot of ways is a fantastic message to put in a film aimed at children because children are always learning and often times they really don't like doing so, but Moana makes the concept of learning seem fun and important. For example Moana in the beginning of the film learns a secret of her people that gives her confidence to go forth with her plans to save her people from the main problem she faces in the story (which I will not be spoiling). But that discovery makes her eager to sail but she doesn't know how to sail, so she learns the basics on her own and later has no problem asking for help when needed to get even better at the sailing. This desire to learn and impliment that learned knowledge in the world and situations Moana finds herself in is a great message for the youth and adults in the audience. Another fantastic thing that Moana has to boast about is the voice acting that it boasts. Really there are not as many characters in this movie as there have been in other Disney movies so the voice acting that Moana does have had to be good to carry the weight of the film and boy do they. Each voice is distinct and fantastic, there is so much charisma and charm to these characters that you don't even think of them as actors in a studio somewhere.And when they sing. Oh My God! Lastly the visuals, of course they are beautiful, its a Disney flick after all. But the water is absolutely incredible, it may be something strange to say but it absolutely made my jaw drop seeing a 3D film with this kind of environment. Overall I do not think this will be the best animated movies of the year, not even the best Disney animated movie of the year, but that is not a knock to Moana its just the year that we have had. Moana is a great movie and can stand with the best of them. It's great, go watch it, everyone, everywhere, any age. It's worth it."
152,Moana,9,18 December 2016,A Seesaw of Dissimilar Components,"""Moana"" is the 56th Disney animated feature film after ""Zootopia"", at the beginning of the year. Directed with atticism, harmony and deep deferences by the Polynesian culture by seasoned pair-director John Musker and Ron Clements (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin"", ""The Princess And The Frog""), the newest treasure of the factory follows Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), a brave young falling in love with wonders in the ocean. She lives accompanied by her sensitive mother Sina (Nicole Scherzinger), her over-protective father Tui (Temuera Morrison) and her former navigator tribe in the radiant island of Motunuilocated in the most westerly place in Chile, in life real, they have lodged there once a nautical misfortune caused absolute cease of their trips on the sea. However, Mother Nature seems to annihilate crops and imposing beauties in which they live, by which, Moana is driven to set sail in search of Maui (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson)the demigod who stole the precious stone from the heart of nature, for giving back the beautiful gem to its home, causing the growth of needy groceries and nature. As is recurrent in the films of the study, Clements and Musker's road movie/ buddy movie will place the duo protagonist in more than one risky and brilliant adventure, forging naturally a spontaneous and classic friendship. What most stands out here is that we don't have a ""Princess"" itself even so she proceed from powerful parents, we don't have a woman of small waist, albino skin, silky hair, there is also no stepmothers or perfidious witches, there are no enchanted castles; however, the best is there's no love interest, quite the contrary, we have an essential story of female emancipation, maturity, and fellowship.Like the best Disney movies, ""Moana"" is electrifying in its traditionalism. From the first moment to the last, the film is a profusion of vividness, verism, and buoyant pictures, reaching optic magnetism that got ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Good Dinosaur"". The textures, looks, styles, volumes and dimensions of each well- prepared features are the real links allowing to bring the story with raging incentive from adult or child audience. Ocean's lifethe water is one of the characters more complicated of conceiving in computer- animated fantasy films,marine flora and faunaalthough they are not too visible, What we watched is impressive, greenish environment of the island, the crafted visuals to Polynesian culture, Moana's curls, Maui's tattoos, everything, everything absolutely has a beautiful extravagance visual. If it were for its realistic images, this would be an instant masterpiece.The Achilles' heel comes from its screenplay written by the vast crew members (8 screenwriters). Because, the story has been related incessantly in previous animated projects; this time, it is the same essence merged into radiant pictures and even though she is the most distant in princess movies, it does not save to feel repetitive. Throughout the feature film, the effortand the lassitudeis remarkable since they wished to have original and entertaining situations, such as the descent into the monsters world, nevertheless, trivialities of the genre are palpable. Rather than palpable are its grueling referencesno, we are not talking about the 'easter eggs', and by the way, I only caught one: Sven from ""Frozen"",the selfsame directors confessed using even some of the material from their prior works. References from the apocalyptic ""Mad Max"" by George Miller to the vibrant ""Mulan"" by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook. Unfortunately, these reminiscences do not bring nostalgia to our minds, they bring certain cynicism when trying to confuse us.This is the best original motion picture soundtrack of Disney in years. Which is led by American actor, playwright, composer, rapper, and writer Lin-Manuel Miranda, who has monopolized lately the public points of attraction starring and creating in the Broadway musicals ""In the Heights"" and ""Hamilton""especially by this last one. Although, many English-speaking viewers attended to movie theaters for seeing ""Moana"" for two reasons primarilyleaving most important aspects aside: the first one, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who lends his voice to Maui and the second one, by acclaimed Miranda's compositions, and although some of the star songs are of his authorship (""How Far I'll Go"", ""You're Welcome""), Opetaia Foa'i collaborated writing ""We Know The Way"" and Mark Mancina composed part of pleasant soundtrack (""Te Fiti Restored"", ""If I Were the Ocean""). It would not be a surprise to see coming nominations at full speed for such great achievement, simply beautiful.""Moana"" from Disney is a delightful journey to open ocean, it is inquisitively a rigorous work. Our aural and optical receivers will experience an unimaginable wonders feast, nonetheless, its narrative and treatment are not at the same level than artistic area. There is no doubt that kids and adult going to enjoy the adventures of the new and less conventional Disney princess, and although the factory is trying to break slowly modern community's unshakable taboos, there's still a long way to go. Disney, thanks for providing pure films, however, they can always be improved further, and they have extravagant opportunities here."
153,Moana,6,18 December 2016,"A potentially excellent movie set back by bland, boring execution","Moana had some excellent, thought-provoking, relevant themes. There was following the destiny that pursues your heart, even if it means forfeiting the set course laid out for you. There was the sturdiness that arises from realizing one's identity and worth, despite losing one's talents and abilities. There was the power of belief to change oneself, and how belief in others can save them from going down a self-destructive path. There was deep-rooted culture, and how discovering one's roots can redefine individuals and influence their people. These are very deep and meaningful ideas.However, I found the execution in the movie to be very poor. Disney had a masterpiece in their hands and instead churned out another generic blockbuster. The humor fell flat, and one joke in particular was a dated pop culture reference that will not stand the test of time. Maui's quirky tattoo jokes didn't add depth to his character. Moana's pet rooster, Heihei, was so distracting and stupid, it made every scene it was in feel crude and desperately lighthearted, as if its audience could not enjoy a film if an animal was not slamming its face into the ground throughout.The soundtrack was excellent, with some very catchy tunes highlighting the film. Despite this, there was no shaking the feeling that Moana was intent on standing in line with familiar clichés and formulas. Rather than standing on its own merits and characters, Disney fell back on its safe Disney 101 formula, while marketing itself as something different due to the fact it is an animated movie based on the Polynesian culture. Moana could have been something much greater with all of its impressive themes and beautiful animations, but most scenes were predictable and boring. Judging on the consensus of the public's reviews, and the financial success of the movie, it pains me that Disney will only be encouraged by the poorly constructed movie that it made when looking towards future productions."
154,Moana,,13 December 2016,"Now this is a heroine. Thanks, Disney!","""If you wear a dress and have an animal sidekick, you're a princess."" Maui (Dwayne Johnson)In animated Moana, the titular Polynesian heroine is also a Disney heroine: smart, feisty, beautiful, wearing a dress, and with a chicken for a sidekick. She is memorable the way a little mermaid or shining fish might be, but more so, because she represents so much of the Samoan and Maori cultures in addition to the impressive musical ones.Yet, maybe the most impressive musical bit comes more from David Bowie than the islands, a song rich about a gold crab's shell punctuated with vigor and humor. Because this is a Disney fantasy, most of the songs are about self actualization and empowerment especially tailored to a pre-teen looking to know who she is and why the ocean has chosen her to save her people.Director Ron Clements and writer Jared Bush show their chops once again by incorporating wit and diffidence in both the heroine and the demigod Maui, whom she seeks to save her people, who have been blighted by years of conservatism and isolationism (""Never go beyond the reef"" is their mantra). The fertility that she exemplifies in the face of their sterility is emphasized finally by the closing shot of a beached sea shell.The Disney refrain of being who you are and who you want to be, while trite in the extreme given the animated history behind these toons, is fresh enough because it is existentially the place for any developing young person and because in these parlous times.Maona is an antidote for cynicism and a hallelujah for ethnic richness promoted by tribal music and dance and family values that feature respect for elders and emerging power for women. You go, Disney!"
155,Moana,8,12 December 2016,A Disney production for better and worse,"No real surprises, Moana is a Disney production. You don't get any real surprises on a Disney production. Even throughout the last decade, that is from Enchanted onward, the age of the twist at the end of the story, even then, no real surprise, once we got the idea of the twist configured into the general scheme of things. But we do get loads of professionally made fun. That's why we keep on going to the cinema again and again.We get well written characters, performed superbly. We get a character for anyone on screen, even for those getting split seconds of screen time, (that's something that Pixar learned well). We also get national myth twisted into Hollywood pattern. I don't know the Polynezian myths but that's the Disney way, that's the way it worked with the Greek myths, with the Chinese, the Jewish, or the Arabian nights stories. In fact, it also happened with literary masterpieces such as Mary Poppins or Peter Pan. That's the way it'll work in future productions too, it takes no power of prophecy to say so, that's simply evident. And as long as it's fun, I'll always be willing to join the ride."
156,Moana,7,4 December 2016,A missed opportunity,"This was a charity screening in Sydney, Australia. The Audience was 80% Polynesian, (Australia has a large population of Pacific Islanders and Moari) 10% Asian, as in Chinese and 10% Aussie. I am getting dementia, I have a dozen Hilo Hattie dresses and same Tahitian Pareu and wore a T shirt dress, after noticing all Frangipani (Plumeria) were coming into flower, didn't pick one much less make a lei. I have been looking forward to this film for a year, it was top of my wanna see list. I was disappointed. This is a nice film with good songs, too many in-jokes, and a formulistic storyline. A little thought could have made it one of the great Disney films. Missed Opportunity #1. The short film prior, about the human body was crxx. A total waste of time, and irrelevant to the theme. Pity they couldn't play 'Lava' from Pixar. Missed opportunity #2. A short documentary on the real life Hokulea of the Polynesian voyaging society, a double hull Polynesian ship sailing around the world as we speak, would have been ideal. MO#3 The chance to make Polynesian myths as valid as Greek myths, which they greatly resemble with capricious Gods and unreliable demi-Gods. Oh, I forgot, Hollywood made 'Troy' without Gods, and without reading the Iliad. Sigh. MO#4 The very real art of Herb Kane, whose images that could so easily had been used in the film to lend greater realism and authenticity. MO#5 over the opening or closing titles, instead of shells and flowers, how about an animated map of the great triangle of Polynesia, showing just how far the wayfinders went... AND: Where was Pele? The greatest female God in the pantheon of the Gods, all Gods. A kickass female God if ever there was one. The songs and the singing were great. But the film as a whole was lacking vibe and any sign of originality. Gods forbid! All hail Pele."
157,Moana,8,5 December 2016,Moana - great lessons for kids,"So i took my daughter who is 5 to see this movie a few weeks ago. Of course i was expecting the usual Disney princess story line but i found that this one had a few different significant lessons in it. Keep in mind this movie is based in Hawaii on an island.1. Growing up... Moana being next in line as Chief on the island wanted to explore the ocean yet her father was holding her back from even setting a toe into the ocean. He himself was the same way and ended getting hurt and lost a friend to the ocean. Her mother was a little more understanding of her daughter not trying to hold her back from her dreams. Lesson for parents you..even if you are afraid to let go of your child you need to give them a chance to express themselves and learn from trial and error you cant protect them all their life.2. Grandmother and Death...Moana's grandmother was very free spirited and related to Moana in fact many of the scenes we see her trying to help Moana go out on the ocean and discover who she is. The grandmother being on her death bed tells Moana to go because the island is slowly dying and their people are in trouble. Grandmother knows Moana is the last hope of their tribe to survive. She like any other elder are the ones we look to for guidance. When grandmother passes away Moana sees her change into a stingray and ""becomes her guardian angel"" This was a way to explain to children that even though death is sad you can still keep that loved one in your thoughts and forever hold on to their memories.3. Environment- The movie shows that our environment is in trouble and without doing anything to help it we are all doomed as our food supplies will disappear and vegetation will be ruined. The reason Moana sets sail is to give back the heart stone so her island can heal. The message is to protect the environment and for a kids movie i think they did a great job at it. The movie was cute my daughter enjoyed it i enjoyed it. I like how Disney incorporated myths and legends as well as traditions and culture. I would recommend this film. The animation was great the music was great and catchy. was it Disneys best film no but the story line had a good meaning to it and i feel that my daughter understood it well with some explanation."
158,Moana,7,5 December 2016,A remake of the little mermaid in disguise,"This has been the closest Disney ever came to realism with their characters. we get ""almost"" real looking characters with conversations you can relate to. the Hair looks so real and the water is a character by itself.. a likable one too!It was nice to see the company be more culturally aware with the material and portray the island myths and legends properly.As a movie however it is someone lack luster, there are so many call backs to Disney's little mermaid that I was just waiting for a kraken to pop up instead of ursula. You have a girl *coughprincesscough* that ""wants more"" that wants to see what's beyond the borders of her home and a father *coughkingcough* that forbids it. doesn't give her a reason just forbids it. Even when the reason is given it's the same one king trident had in the TV series of the little mermaid!If that's not enough when she finally sings her song she gives the same iconic stand as Arial does when the was crash behind her. it was eerie... As a whole the visuals were beautiful, characters almost too realistic but the movie is an average one with a very straight forward predictable plot."
159,Moana,8,4 December 2016,Top tier Disney that brings all the classic Disney traits along for an unforgettable journey,"Disney's 56th animated feature film comes in the shape of Moana, a film that takes the audience on an adventure across the ocean with the usual mix of beautiful animation, heartfelt narrative and catchy songs. Disney have already had a strong year with the likes of Zootopia and Finding Dory so the pressure was on for them to deliver a hat-trick for the year.Moana Waialiki (Auli'i Cravalho) is the daughter of the village chief who's tribe lives on the Polynesian island of Motunui. Having a connection with the ocean since a very young age, Moana has always been stopped by her father, Chief Tui Waialiki (Temuera Morrison), from going out beyond the reef.When she hears of the legendary demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and how he holds the key to stopping Matunui from decaying, Moana sets sail across the dangerous ocean to locate Maui and have him restore the heart of Te Fiti, an island goddess, so she can restore life to Motunui.As I've already mentioned, Moana brings a lot of classic Disney traits to the table and it does it so well, putting it up there as one of the best Disney films in recent years. The animation on show in Moana is just stunning, awash with such vibrant colours, bringing the ocean and characters to life quite brilliantly.I really enjoyed the film's writing of both narrative and characters too; the story being one that resonates with real life and having to look after our planet, along with the emotional family element that really sets the story in motion. The film is very funny as well, Heihei the rooster stealing many scenes and a nod to Mad Max: Fury Road as Moana and Maui run into a group of Kakamora pirates on the ocean. Never thought I'd ever be seeing a homage to that particular film in a Disney animation.The characters are as colourful and strong as the animation, and the voice work from Dwayne Johnson and Auli'i Cravalho is top notch, both sounding as if they've fulfilled a dream of playing a character in a Disney animation. Then there are the songs of Moana, beautifully written and performed by the respective cast members, my personal favourites being You're Welcome and I Am Moana.Moana really is top tier Disney and while I think I preferred Zootopia, Moana is superior to Frozen, Disney's biggest smash-hit in the past few years. I know what I'd rather see a sequel to."
160,Moana,,4 February 2017,'Moana' Brings Disney Closer To Its Former Glory Than It's Ever Been,"Adventurous, endearing & delightfully amusing, the latest feature film from Walt Disney Animation Studios finds the legendary studio at the very peak of its Revival Era and closer than it's ever been to its former glory, for Moana is another excellent blend of first-rate storytelling & dazzling animation that promises plenty of fun & enjoyment to viewers of all ages and skilfully delivers it.The story of Moana follows its titular character, the only daughter of a Polynesian tribe's Chieftain who's always been curious about what lies beyond the reef surrounding her island. And when their crops begin to fail, she sets off on an epic journey across the ocean to find the demigod Maui, who caused the blight by stealing a mystical relic from a goddess, and persuade him to return it.Directed by Ron Clements & John Musker, the film quickly glances over its mythology & Polynesian tribe's way of life before moving ahead with its main plot, and maintains a steady pace & fun vibe throughout its runtime. The direction is neat, plot is expertly handled, humour is finely applied even though it goes overboard at times, and the characters of Moana & Maui are handled with elegance.The animation is absolutely gorgeous, decorating the film with sumptuous set pieces and employs some hand-crafted magic as well on its CGI canvas. Every image brims with vibrant colours, sharp outlines, terrific lighting & a sense of depth. The soundtrack is beautifully composed & seamlessly integrated into the narrative, and while the musical numbers aren't catchy, they do carry a melodic tune.It's quite impossible to not like a film that has Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, playing a demigod, and singing songs. Bringing Maui to life with finesse, it's evident that Johnson had a lot of fun voicing this character that seems tailor-made for him in more ways than one. The character of Moana is voiced by a newcomer and she does an outstanding job at it, wonderfully balancing the vocal tonality to fit the particular moment.On an overall scale, Moana is a musical that has something in store for everyone. Not everything works out in the film's favour though, for the sentient coconut pirate scene was quite unnecessary and the sidekicks overstay their welcome but it offers consistent delivery of laughs, a welcome depth in its plot & characters, and wonderfully carved moments of genuine warmth to finish as another high-quality addition to Disney's repertoire. Definitely recommended."
161,Moana,,26 November 2016,Charming and delightful,"There are various things I could say about this film that make it sound like I didn't like it. For example, I could say that it's very formulaic in its narrative and character arcs. The themes are also very derivative of themes that other films have also examined. Nothing about the film is entirely surprising. However, it says something about the quality of the execution that despite how predictable it is, it's still able to work wonders. The animation is dazzling and beautiful and the characters are really written with a lot of care. Although the story itself is very derivative, having these types of characters (of Polynesian roots) in the forefront is definitely something original and I do hope that Disney, even when creating films that hit the same beats and follow the same formula, can still create characters that are different in that way."
162,Moana,8,22 November 2016,Exceptional...though the songs are only okay.,"""Moana"" is the latest full length animated film from Disney and it's a worthy successor to its last CGI success, ""Zootopia"". While the film isn't perfect, it is very enjoyable and original.The story in ""Moana"" is based y loosely on Polynesian folklorein particular, their trickster demigod, Maui (Dwayne Johnson). Because of Maui's actions, nature is very slowly dying off and ruin is coming for Moana and her people. However, Moana's father, the Chief, is afraid of what lies beyond their island and forbids Moana from leaving on a journey to try to restore the lost heart to the Island Mother. Using pluck and determination, and with a bit of help from Maui, Moana makes this journey. This synopsis might sound very strange and confusingand it's best you just see the film for yourself. Suffice to say, it is a real crowd pleaser due to an interesting, stunning computer animation and very original story as well as some interesting characters. I particularly liked Moana as she was strong and likableand not someone needing rescuing. But she also wasn't harsh or stereotypicaljust determined. I also loved her pet sidekick, as this chicken is nothing like any Disney sidekickand you'll soon realize this animal is possibly the dumbest in Disney historyas well as very funny.. As for Dwayne Johnson ('The Rock') he was also very goodand I was surprised that he had a decent singing voice in the film. As for the singing in general, however, this is the weakest aspect of the film. While most of the songs are enjoyable, a few are quite forgettable and none have that singability you look for in a full-length Disney cartoon. You'll almost certainly not be singing or humming the tunes once the film has concluded.Finally, I'd like to point out that I really loved the look of the film. I've visited the South Pacific and New Zealand and the movie really does a great job of capturing the look and spirit of this part of the world. It's also nice that kids in this part of the world now finally have their own Disney princessone who isn't a carbon copy of other Disney females."
163,Moana,8,22 December 2016,"Good overall, but story is lacking","Moana is a very good movie overall, but there are some elements which I found lacking. First of all the story was not as though out and developed as some other Disney films like Zootopia. Second, it makes use of the similar Disney princess tropes, and sort of forms a basic story around these tropes. The animation however, was stellar, and Lin-Manuel Miranda's soundtrack was beautiful.full review here:https://erindaniellethompson.wordpress.com/2016/12/22/moana/"
164,Moana,9,23 November 2016,Wayfinding Into New Territory with A Likable Heroine and Interesting Tale,"I still can't believe my eyes in what I just saw. The visuals of Polynesian culture, tranquil vegetation, an immersive oceanic setting that's a living entity of its own, expressive songs performed magnificently by newcomer Auli'i Cravalho (I have to also credit The Rock having some singing chops too), and the character dynamics all kept my attention that it summed up yet another dazzling successor from this year's caper film Zootopia by the crew at Disney. Moana definitely has spunk and a spiritual personality mirroring that of Pocahontas crossed with a hint of Lilo Pelekai that my attention shifted quickly on where her adventure will take her next.The story of Moana is that she's a free-spirited Polynesian individual who dreams of following her own path beyond her home in the Pacific Islands ever since she can barely walk. However when her home island of Motunui is threatened by a mysterious supernatural being and given the guidance of her wise grandmother, she must venture out in the ocean waters to find the demigod Maui where they must team up to put an end to the chaos.The chemistry between Auli'i Cravalho voicing the leading heroine Moana and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson voicing demigod Maui began to somewhat remind me of the witty banter between characters of previous Disney animated films (Zootopia and Wreck-It Ralph to name a few) as well as a cross between the whimsical Genie of ""Aladdin"" and reluctant personality of Phil from ""Hercules"" on Maui's end. Not to mention his tattoos are also appealing because they seem to have a mind of their own and him spouting a couple wisecracking meta-references in some parts of the film were pretty laughable. Notably, the song ""How Far I'll Go"" is enthralling and stands out the most among the other well-written music pieces, giving a sort of ""Lion King"" chill to it. Broadway playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda (Hamilton) definitely laid his cards out on the table by unveiling a few catchy songs and the collaborations with both Jemaine Clement and South Pacific Fusion singer Opetaia Foa'i made the ambiance feel more culturally serene and enchanting at the same time.Directors John Musker and Ron Clements have certainly come a long way spanning well over three decades under Disney since I remembered their work dating back to 1986. Whether it be The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Hercules, or even Princess and the Frog, they've certainly pushed their boundaries further from their usual 2D animated flicks and wayfinding into 3D terrain with an intriguing story on how one heroine doesn't need a prince to rescue her or fall in love with (though an animal sidekick is a must). No, instead the focus is about finding the path that suits you along with the perils that lie ahead and seeing that there is good somewhere within. But hey, no one said it would be easy.Look out, awards season. This is definitely a must-see and I applaud the amazing cast and crew for weaving such a tale."
165,Moana,8,29 December 2016,Moana is a beautifully animated Walt Disney Pictures family film that is simply astounding with visuals and just wonderful to experience.,"Moana is the newest film produced by Walt Disney Pictures, and has now become a part of being one of the best movies of the year. The plot centers around a young teenage girl named Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), who for all of her childhood up to her teenage years, has wanted to sail out on the open sea. However, her father and chief of her tribe forbids sailing outside of the reef surrounding the island. Meanwhile, a dark force of death consumes the environment of the world slowly, and the magic force of the ocean chooses Moana to save the world. Along the way, Moana will find help from a Demigod named Maui (voiced by Dwayne Johnson) to restore peace and life to the world. The animation is wonderfully done with a smooth style. The story has been done before however, a young girl wants to venture out, but her father/mother will not allow her to, but she eventually wanders off into adventure. Disney has done a story like this before, but they tell it in a way that seems original and interesting, rather than retelling a story over and over again the same way. The movie itself is hilarious and filled with family fun and laughter. The voices provided bu Auli'l Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson make the journey more enjoyable for all ages. The music and singing are very catchy and feels pleasant to listen to. In the end, Moana is another big success for Disney, even if the story has been done before, this is why I gave ""Moana"" a 9 out of 10."
166,Moana,10,24 July 2017,Another Disney gold!,"After a string of critical and box office hits in the past 8-9 years like Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck-it-Ralph, Frozen, and Big Hero 6, Walt Disney Animation just hit a new high this century in 2016 with Zootopia and now this Moana movie. From what I've heard, the cultural depiction is quite accurate and it's has some valuable lessons in it too.Maui might just be my second favorite Disney animated character after the one and only Genie of the Lamp. The songs are incredibly soothing and so good to listen to. The animations are breathtaking as well. If you haven't watched it, I strongly suggest you to check it out with the whole family (Or just by yourself)!"
167,Moana,10,8 May 2017,Awesome,"Best movie ever. Its like Nemo, one of those movies that you can watch 10 times a day and never get sick of it. The song tracks are absolutely beautiful. love this movie, so does the kids, i think i do secretly more. Watch it, you wont be disappointed. 10/10 :-). The graphics is this movie are unbelievable."
168,Moana,10,23 March 2017,Disney is on a roll,"Moana is a truly spectacular, the movie is likely to be the best movie I have watched this year. By far the funniest Disney movie in a long time . The whole movie has a very unique plot that delivered its message in the best way possible. When I'm watching Moana I feel so happy like I'm in a tropical paradise and very few movies accomplish the feeling of a long vacation. The characters make me laugh through the whole movie. Moana is funniest adventure I have seen in a long time and is a great family movie as well."
169,Moana,8,7 March 2017,"Another conventional, predictable story that Disney executes incredibly well","The Disney fairytale mold sets sail for Polynesia in ""Moana,"" the studio's latest animated musical featuring a strong female lead character, and a film hoping to build off the success of ""Frozen"" and ""Tangled."" Although audiences are unlikely to be as familiar with ancient Polynesian mythology as they were with the stories of Rapunzel or Hans Christian Andersen, ""Moana"" isn't all that different from these films; Disney has simply dressed its contemporary revamp of the tried and true fairytale formula in oceanic trappings.Although mentioning any kind of formula may seem dismissive or chiding of ""Moana,"" the film absolutely works thanks to a healthy dose of creativity and heart, not to mention self awareness. Despite seven Disney minds claiming a story credit on the film, the studio wisely assigned scripting duties to Jared Bush, writer of its previous 2016 hit, ""Zootopia."" The writing has some of the same edginess, quirkiness and self-awareness of that film (and others) that has allowed Disney's house brand to churn out better films than Pixar of late.Combine that with Disney's longest-working directing duo of Ron Clements and John Musker (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Hercules"") and you get an animated feature that's both exciting and different yet fundamentally sound and familiar. Nothing about the ""Moana"" story is surprising. Heard the one about the girl who comes from royalty, has an overprotective father, longs for something beyond what she knows and must go off on an adventure with animal companions and fulfill her destiny? Exactly. But ""Moana"" knows that. In fact, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) insists she's not a princess. And her problems aren't typical of a princess, specifically that she doesn't want or need to love anyone or marry someone. The movie really centers on her personal adversity. Although she faces some standard Disney conflicts from outside forces including her father's stern rules (Temuera Morrison), a cocky travel partner in demi-god Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and some creatures on her journey, there's no clear villain, at least not one who needs development. Ultimately, she must outlast nature and stand up to or outsmart male characters and believe in herself to succeed. Nicely done, Disney.Yet creativity does more for the movie than feminist underpinnings. Heihei the chicken, the dumbest and strangest animal companion of any Disney movie (voiced of course by Alan Tudyk doing nothing but squawking), provides countless off-beat laughs while Johnson does nicely with the traditional silliness, slapstick and braggadocio humor more common of animated features. The ingenuity of his transformations and tattooed cartoon self being a secondary character help elevate the entertainment in a major way. A second act appearance by Jemaine Clement voicing a giant crab is also a highlight, and his atypical song is absolute brilliance if you listen closely.Riding the waves of success from ""Hamilton: An American Musical,"" composer/songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda's fingerprints are all over the ""Moana"" soundtrack. His incredible verbal flow is on display in Johnson's song ""You're Welcome"" and the aforementioned Clement song ""Shiny,"" while the film's piece de resistance, ""How Far I'll Go,"" floods the story with emotion each time it shows up in a way that makes ""Let It Go"" feel like a hit song rather than an essential part of ""Frozen.""Even in the form of a predictable story, this degree of heart, in tandem with the visual beauty and creativity, make ""Moana"" another successive hit for Disney. All formulas eventually grow tiresome, and the template that allowed ""Moana"" to thrive will eventually need to be reworked, just as Disney had to do with its animated musicals in the 2000s, but for now it's on a roll. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

170,Moana,9,26 November 2016,The Different Kind of Lovable Disney Princess and A Sure Classic Animated Movie,"Well it's been a long time since the last animated movie of Frozen (also by Disney) that I was truly entertained with such film that had a lot of songs. While that movie I watched by myself, I had the pleasure of my wife's company watching this one. And I knew from the first few minutes that she would love this movie till the end (proven by her various emotions during the duration of the movie). This movie was very very good in term of story and the quality of the animation which made the characters look soooo much alive. I could picture Grandma in real life and also Maui (who I pictured would look like Dwayne Johnson). The songs in this movie were mostly gorgeous with the one sung by Auli'i especially nice (I think it was titled How Far I'll Go). This is a movie for all audience. I am very sure children would be entertained by the funny scenes involving Heihei (the dumbest chicken we have seen, LOL), while the more adults would be happy to see the adventure and the moral of the story. It is mainly about a girl trying to find out her real destiny and doing everything she can to fulfill it because she felt it was her responsibility. It was a different kind of princess than the usual Disney princesses (this was mentioned very cleverly by the writers through Maui when he talked about this in the first few scenes of him together with Moana in the ocean). Another thing that was a bit different from the previous Disney movies such as Zootopia or Jungle Book, was the fact that in this movie, the animals do not speak.In addition to those, the relationship built between Moana and Maui, plus the strong presence of Grandma made the whole movie truly felt like a complete Disney style animated movie. Well done Disney team, you have done it again!For those of you who have not watched this movie, please go there and see it. And please do not be late, as there was a very great short story presented before the movie started. I am very sure those working people like me, would appreciate such a lovely story. Oooh and another thing. Apparently there was also an end credit scene which I did not know of. So if you have not seen it, do not leave your seats till the very end. I understand it would show something that people who watched Disney's animated movies could relate to.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"
171,Moana,10,26 November 2016,"Finally, Disney's BACK!!!","It's been FOREVER since I walked out of a Disney movie all dreamy and amazed...there's always been something off...the music, the story, the animation. Moana just got it all, I walked out with the biggest grin on my face!! I feel like finally, Disney got his act together and remembered what we loved with the Lion King, Aladin, Beauty of the Beast... The animation is AMAZING. The sea, the colors. The islands, the land, the flowers, the colors. Yo don't know where to look, everything looks amazing. The story is great, authentic, based on a great culture. There was research involved and you feel it. The characters are awesome, authentic as well, strong. Yet super funny too. And the songs are diverse and catchy again!! I just LOVED the movie, I've been twice already, bought the soundtrack...well. Disney's back :) I strongly recommend it."
172,Moana,10,26 November 2016,Must See Disney Original,"First things first.Disney once again gives us an original short prior to the feature called Inner Workings. It picks up where Inside Out left off, whereas we get to see how the human mind/body works. I'm not entirely convinced kids, especially younger kids will appreciate this one, but it hits a powerful chord with every working adult. Boring, Boring, and Glum resonates to the point where I laughed almost as much to keep from crying as I did from the pure humor.As for the newest Disney Original feature film of Moana, words like beautiful, delightful, funny, exciting, thrilling, action packed, innovative, charming, mesmerizing, emotional, and inspiring leap to mind. While for the most part, I'm loving the sequels the company has been doing, Moana recaptures the magic and wonder of Disney original stories and makes me extremely happy this is the course they'll be pursuing again. I'm a fan! The largely Pacific islands cast with the exception of Dwayne Johnson as the voice of Maui, Nicole Scherzinger, and Alan Tudyk is unfamiliar to me. However, the perfection in the casting is undeniable. The characters these actors create are comforting, warm, three dimensional.The musical score, includes songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda (of Hamilton fame) perfectly accentuates and punctuates the story elevating the level of entertainment. Plenty of toe tapping and seat dancing to be had. While none of the songs will most likely reach Let I Go proportions, I defy you not to laugh, hum along and get You're Welcome stuck in your head. Others have tried, maybe even come close, but no one tops Disney/Pixar animators when it comes to water animation. No one. The overall animation is also out of this world. There's great us combined 2D and 3D animation to make the story pop, especially the mythology sequences. The research done to capture the vivid colors and textures of the Pacific Islands flora and fauna gives Moana an unsurpassed tactility. I wanted to jump on the next plane to see islands myself.I thoroughly enjoyed myself and can't give Moana anything but a 10 and look forward to adding it to my personal movie collection to enjoy for years to come.ALERT for you folks that dash out as soon as the credits roll. Stick around to the end. Enjoy the closing credits music because there's a final scene when all is said and done that will make you smile."
173,Moana,9,25 November 2016,Another return to Disney's classic formula,"Moana was the only other animated film besides Zootopia that I considered a must-see film for this year. I was really drawn in by its premise, which I thought was a spiritual predecessor to Lilo and Stitch (a movie that I consider a must-see as well). For the most part, I wasn't disappointed, as the story does capture the feel of what seemed to be obligatory in a movie with this kind of premise. The characters aren't as complex as they are in Zootopia, but they do feel closer to what some people consider those from a true Disney musical. The characters present me with one of my main complaints of this movie: I am still not certain of what Maui's motivation was to rejoin Moana. It's not a surprise that the animation is Disney's finest yet, with more colors than I can count and effects that I have never seen before in a Disney film (the way it blends CGI with hand-drawn effects, such as Maui's tattoos). The songs are at worst tolerable, but at their best, they seem like ones from a Disney Renaissance film, even if there are so many of them. Speaking of the Disney Renaissance, this film has solidified the existence of the Neo-Renaissance that began, as many Disney buffs like to consider, 7 years ago. It doesn't have the ambition of Zootopia, however it is amazing in its own way and should please those who have a passion for Disney's musical formula. All I can sum this up with is go watch it."
174,Moana,7,31 July 2017,Fairly Generic Disney,"It's nice to see a spunky female heroine of color at the center of a Disney film, and it's also nice that the story doesn't remotely involve her falling in love with anyone by the film's end, but this movie still couldn't completely shake off its patina of generic Disney message. The animation is pretty, the music is forgettable (with the exception of the rousing Oscar-nominated anthem ""How Far I'll Go""), and the story is moderately engrossing. This was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 2016 Academy Awards, but it's no where nearly at the same level as some of its co-nominees, namely ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" and my personal favorite, ""The Red Turtle.""Grade: B"
175,Moana,7,29 June 2017,Colourful and pleasant but predictable and not particularly memorable,"Once again we are told that to be happy we must follow our dreams despite the advice of our elders, which always works out well in Disney movies, but is an overly simplistic and potentially dangerous message with which to continually indoctrinate children. ""Moana"" is colourful but not very original entry into the Disney 'Princess' franchise (despite the self-referential declination). The sidekick chicken was amusing and, unusual for the genre, not much of a merchandising gimmick. The Rock as Maui was fine as the loud-mouth counterpoint to Moana's typical 'coming of age' girl character but neither of them brought anything new to the canon. Maui's ""Your Welcome"" song (both the music and the imagery) was a standout in an otherwise bland score. The parallels with ""Star Wars (1976) are obvious - all of these types of stories tend to follow the 'hero-myth' trajectory, but this pair is pretty close (a youth who wants to leave, adults resisting, disaster strikes at home, an older mentor who dies and returns as a guiding spirit, a worldly, self-centred companion who flees only to heroically return in the nick of time, a surprise reveal about the nature of the 'enemy'). I'll admit that I'm the wrong gender and 50 years too old to be in the target audience for this kind of movie, but I enjoyed it enough to give it a reasonably high rating."
176,Moana,,24 June 2017,"Okay, but too many cooks made some significant weaknesses","I'm pretty sure most kids - and a lot of parents - will probably enjoy ""Moana"" a lot. Technically, the movie is first rate, with animation that is very colorful, detailed, and breathtaking. There are some very good (and exciting) action sequences here and there. And many viewers will be taken by the title character, who is intelligent, brave, and resourceful.However, there are some major weakness in the entire package that significantly lower the movie from the label of modern day classic. For example, the script has some holes. For starters, if Moana has lived on a small island for many years, why doesn't she know about the chiefs monument on top of the mountain? Or know about the cave hidden by the waterfall? Another problem is that the movie, at 107 minutes in length, is much too long for its own good. While the movie never gets to be boring, the padding is very evident. And the songs, while not terrible, are not very memorable at all.As I indicated in my summary line, I think these weaknesses came from the fact that too many people were working in key roles - look at the fact that there were four directors, and even more people working on the story. If there had been one clear vision, maybe the aforementioned problems would have been reduced significantly. I'll give the movie this: It's a step up from the overrated Disney movie ""Frozen"". Maybe Disney is slowly improving."
177,Moana,,10 May 2017,Very excellent and entertaining animated musical.,"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. This IMDb main page has a sufficient synopsis of the story so I won't repeat it in what I am writing.I just want to comment on the production values. The looks and motions, walking, running, swimming, etc of the animated characters is probably the best I have seen. The faces of the human characters have exaggerated features, like slightly too large eyes, big legs, etc to definitely place them as intended animated figures. But otherwise they move, talk, and sing very realistically. The water, trees, sky, etc are very realistic.High schooler Auli'i Cravalho is the voice of Moana, only child of the King and destined to be the leader one day. When very young she is ""chosen"" by the ocean to make a journey and restore order and beauty to their islands. Ms Cravalho already was a singer in high school activities and sings her songs very nicely here.She is required to enlist the help of Dwayne Johnson as demi-god and shape-shifter Maui. He is reluctant but Moana is very persistent.Overall a very entertaining hour and a half."
178,Moana,4,10 May 2017,"Stunning Animation, but not much else to offer","I may have liked this movie more if I would have watched with the sound turned off. The music was horrendous, the characters were boring, and the plot was sub-par at best. And what was with the androgynous crab? I felt like I was tripping on acid while watching Liberace perform as Boy George. Not really my cup of tea.With that said, the animation was breath-taking, and the cast did a great job with a not-well-written script. I love The Rock, but even he couldn't make this movie live up to my expectations. Watch Tangled, then Moana and you'll see why I give this movie 4 out of 10 stars."
179,Moana,8,29 April 2017,A brilliant spin on the classic Disney story,"Moana was a film that took a unique spin on the classic Disney princess story. It was an unique twist to use real life Polynesian culture to convey this Disney story. It was a beautiful telling of an unknown story. Both Cravalho and Johnson were great in this film. They were both able to show humorous sides but also very funny sides. I thought Johnson was especially great as he showed a sorta arrogant and downright jerky side. It was a different take on some of the previous roles we have seen him in before. Some of the others actors such as, Rachel Hale as Gramma Tala and the unknown voice of the chicken. They were very funny and great additions to the story I thought the songs were done quite well. ""How Far I'll Go"" was obviously the feature song but personally I enjoyed ""Your Welcome"". I thought every song did what it was supposed to and really added to the story line. The plot of the story whiles being the classic Disney story it was done well. It added the unique Polynesian culture and some great side stories.All in all, this was a very well done movie. It was a welcome addition to the Disney princesses classics and deserves the right to have a sequel."
180,Moana,8,24 April 2017,Moana the Ocean Princess!!!,"I can definitely see why this movie broke all kinds of Disney Box Office Records because it is pure magic, action and adventure everywhere with Moana being brave next to Maui being very strong so this is definitely a family movie to watch over and over again!!! The characters and the story are all very funny with all of the above emotional moments that every Disney Movie has being that there are References made from all kinds of the other Disney Movies that are in this one."
181,Moana,9,23 November 2016,"Don't Care for Animated Film or Disney, but this is an exception.","OK. I am a fan of Dwayne Johnson, ever since his days as a wrestler with the WWE, called The Rock. IN this movie,the songs were great. The setting was beautiful. And the story not too complicated. Newcomer Auli'i Cravalho was great with her voice acting and wish her the best of luck in the future. If you stick around for the after-credits scene, there is a very cool but funny pop culture reference to a classic Disney animated film. Instead of spending money on that over-rated snooze-fest "" The Edge of Seventeen"" take the family out to see this film. This is type of animated film, that will make you laugh and make you cry. This movie is great in showcasing a new side to Dwayne Johnson. Apart from the villain being underused, this movie is great. 9 of 10 stars!"
182,Moana,10,22 November 2016,SHOVES culture into the audiences faces :-) MUHUHAHAHAA,"*beep* yes. Way to go Disney.This was in no way watered down culture used simply as a backdrop, like they did when they cancelled ""Kingdom of the Sun"" and turned it into Emperor's New Groove. (Removing all of the strong overt Inca/Quechua plot elements, gods, and songs) Or even to a degree what they did to Mulan.Moana aggressively shoves culture at audiences. Moreso then even things like Aladdin. There are multiple long strong sequences in their full on native languages. Can you imagine if Aladdin had overtures in Arabic? Or Mulan in Chinese? They would feel like completely different films. The characters in Moana behave within their religion and value system. It was so impressive. The only anachronisms were a few odd jokes from Maui. But it's remarkably in the time period and well done. The richness is on display, not hidden.GOOD MORE Disney. MORE LIKE THIS"
183,Moana,8,23 November 2016,You'll go have Mo Funna if You See Moanna,"It wouldn't feel like Thanksgiving without a Disney animated feature to grace the silver screen. And this weekend the animation studios are at it again with another masterpiece sure to be nominated for best animated picture of the year. The name of the movie this time is Moana, a tale of Polynesian mythology wrapped up in a nice, Disney magical package. Will this movie net Disney the best picture of the year award, or is it just another filler until Pixar's next work? Robbie K happy to bring you another review this holiday season. Let's get started. LIKES:  Fun, new setting  Comedy  Soundtrack was kickingWe all know Disney makes fun films, but Moana's fun comes in form of the beautiful settings of the Pacific. Stepping away from the castles, this film will enchant you as you set sail on the majestic oceans and the mythical creatures that inhabit them. The world is colorful and dynamically shaded to match the tones of the film, which give the film a little energy to spice things up. No surprise, the animation is fluid (as always) as realistic movements (both living and nonliving) are captured in this breathtaking CGI. While I didn't see it in 3-D, this film's design would have popped out more with the special effects, therefore earning a recommendation to give it a try if you wish. But a Disney movie isn't just about the scenery, oh no you have to have characters that make you laugh and you can latch onto. Moana continues this trend, with the lead character (Moana) being the ever inspiring, girl power rocking, role model that most leads are. In terms of laughs though, Maui has you covered on this field. Dwayne Johnson delivers in the film, his bold, brash, and loud delivery matching the charisma of the demi-god. The hero has plenty of silly qualities to him, clever one-liners, slapstick antics, and a dancing tattoo which kept me laughing through most of the film. Throw in an idiotic chicken and anthropomorphic ocean and the you get a unique team for tickling your funny bone. My favorite aspect of this movie though has to be the soundtrack. This movie finally took a step back into the Disney renaissance world. A fantastic orchestra work sets the stage for adventure, bold brass instruments blaring and drums pounding as the boat coasts out into the wild. Other scenes have a more elegant touch to them to match the touching moments, rounding out the emotion of the film in a complete package. But many will fall in love with the original music our cast composes, bringing the upbeat, inspirational tone that will have young and young at heart hitting repeat over and over again. The soundtrack was perfect for this movie, and yours truly loved the islander twist to spice the tunes up. DISLIKES:  Not as exciting as other adventures  Unnecessary scenes  Missed potentialWhile Moana was fun and beautiful, it wasn't the most thrilling tale to grace the library. The film lacked suspense for me, never finding myself at the edge of my seat fearing for our heroes. Perhaps it was the obvious foreshadowing, or the fact that very little of the threats seemed deadly, but more cuddly and silly. Plus, the character development was a little lacking at times, so there didn't seem the looming threat of Disney killing a favorite character. Without the excitement, the adventure did grow a bit dull in terms of thrills, but fortunately the fun and animation make up for it. An even stronger dislike was how unnecessary some of the scenes were in the film for me. A few of the moments, were impromptu sequences meant to instill a sense of urgency, an effort I appreciate. However, the urgency had already been established and these scenes added little to the overall emotion or plot of the story. Unfortunately, the biggest sting was entering one ""supposedly"" dangerous island that Maui builds up. It had such build up and potential, and then they dropped it. This island could have been a very unique and dangerous world that added some edge and diversity to the film in regards to bizarre flora and fauna. Yet, they quickly skimmed over this part to get to an obnoxious character (the conflict with him rather lackluster), which left me a tad disappointed. Sadly, no other creatures or beasts appeared from the depths to enhance the adventure, nor any major challenges to gradually enhance the skills of our heroes. The bottom line of this dislike, is that the editing was slightly off track for this reviewer and could have been expanded upon to add more depth and excitement to the film. The VERDICTMoana is another fine example of how awesome Disney is at animation. Beautiful visuals bring alive a unique world that will make you crave to be on the majestic waters of the pacific islands. In addition, it's a very fun movie that contains both laughs and music to instill the positive energy that Disney films love to do around the holidays. Despite all of this though, it wasn't the most exciting adventure for me and I really would have liked to see more of the mythology brought into the tale to further develop our lovable characters (and more of the cute pig too). Still, this film is worth visiting in the theaters for all ages and will spread some early holiday joy over you and those you love. My scores:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5"
184,Moana,8,22 November 2016,"With the return of John Musker and Ron Clements, who made some Disney's classics, we are reminded why the House of Mouse has long been the pinnacle of animated storytelling.","Generally, I shy away from musicals for only a handful of songs I like and the rest I suffer through. However, there is always an exception made for Disney. For even though the magic and replay value of their 90s songs has long been gone (I still do not understand the love for ""Let It Go""), they still can pull tears out of your ducts and remind you why, even if you are way past their targeted market, the reason you fell in love with the company as a kid.Noted Actor(s)Moana (Auli'I Cravalho) | Maui (Dwayne Johnson) | Gramma Tala (Rachel House) | Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison) | Hei Hei (Alan Tudyk)StorylineFor a generation, Chief Tui has forbidden his people to explore the world beyond their island's reef. Something his mother Tala understands the reason for but doesn't agree with at all. Especially as the island begins to no longer be the resource-rich home it once was. Enter Moana. She, like her father when he was young, has a sense of adventure in her, something no matter how many times she is warned, her dad can't force out of her. So, as she sees her home dying, and her dad preps her to become the chief, she takes her people's fate beyond the reef and seeks out Maui. A demigod who, according to legend, thanks to him taking the heart of Tahiti, released a darkness onto the world which is why Moana's people are facing the peril they are.HighlightsIt Will Make You CryDeath and rejection are a huge part in modern animated stories, and not just within anime. Disney, as long as I can remember, would always have a dead parent or a misfit somewhere in its movie. This one is no different but, arguably, it isn't like before. Just take Maui for example. His backstory of how he became a demi-god is heartbreaking in a way. That on top of the reason why Tui doesn't want his people venturing past the reef, and what Cravalho through her voice, and the various animators and writers, bring to Moana's story. For while there is this little small part of me which wishes to compare this to Musker and Clements past work, which in some ways they nod to, this film reminds me of something. It reminds me of why people like Floyd Norman love working at Disney and why we, from pampers through our adult years, laugh, cry, and create more and more fond memories of their products.It Will Make You Laugh*Okay, if you are a kid, or can appreciate humor made for children, between Maui and Hei Hei you'll find quite a few chuckles here and there. The ocean also plays a role in the laughter as we see it interact with Maui, Hei Hei, and especially its interactions with Moana.On The FenceIt's FormulaicIn fact, Maui even jokes about it. A young princess, though technically chief's daughter, with her animal, Hei Hei, going on an adventure. But while the story seems familiar, and at times may remind you of The Little Mermaid in terms of Moana's relationship with her dad, Maui's tattoo companion reminding you of some of the animation in Hercules, Moana kind of looking like a slightly older Lilo, and I could go on, the familiarity ultimately helps you connect with the film. For as you pick up on what perhaps is Clements and Musker tipping their hat to their past work, it reminds you of what those movies made you feel and it makes you connection to this new movie of theirs even stronger. Sort of like how, for some, the new J.K. Rowling movie I'm sure brings up old emotions from reading, or watching Harry Potter.Overall: Positive (Worth Seeing)While it is formulaic, and also the songs may not be instant classics, it is funny, it has depth, it has a sense of culture, and honestly as Disney tries to diversify and stray away from its classic princesses, it continues to be a step forward. Reminding you the house of mouse need not depend on Pixar for it remains the juggernaut of the industry it damn near built. A title, and role, even with the occasional hiccup, it seems it may never lose even with its founder long passed."
185,Moana,4,5 March 2017,Not the best,"I'm sorry. When it came to this film, I really wanted to like it. I really did. If you removed all of the musical numbers it really would've been a better film but it felt like the songs were just shoved into the film because it's a Disney film and it's expected to be a musical. Not only were the songs uninspiring, they pretty much lacked any Polynesian energy or feel to them. I will say that the voice actors did a great job and the animation was up to Disney standards."
186,Moana,8,13 February 2017,Awesome Disnay movie ever,"Another wonderful movie to add to the Disney classics. 2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It is awesome movie.A small pounamu stone that is the mystical heart of the goddess Te Fiti is stolen by the demigod Maui, who was planning to give it to humanity as a gift. As Maui makes his escape, he is attacked by the lava demon Te Kā, causing the heart of Te Fiti as well as his power-granting magical fish hook to be lost in the ocean. Young Moana Waialiki, daughter and heir of the chief on the small Polynesian island of Motunui, is chosen by the ocean to receive the heart, but drops it when her father, Chief Tui, comes to get her. He insists the island provides everything the villagers need. Years later, fish become scarce and the island's vegetation begins dying. Moana proposes going beyond the reef to find more fish. Chief Tui rejects her request, as sailing past the reef is forbidden.Moana's grandmother, Gramma Tala, shows Moana a secret cave behind a waterfall, where she discovers her ancestors were voyagers, sailing and discovering new islands across the world. Tala explains that they stopped voyaging because Maui stole the heart, causing monsters to appear in the ocean. Tala then reveals that the darkness has been spreading from island to island, slowly killing, and now Motunui is next.Tala falls ill and with her dying breaths tells Moana to set sail. Moana and her pet chicken Heihei depart in a drua to find Maui to restore the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. After a typhoon wave flips her sailboat and knocks her unconscious, she awakens the next morning on an island inhabited by Maui, who traps her in a cave and takes her sailboat to search for his fishhook. After escaping and catching up to Maui, Moana tries to convince him to return the heart, but Maui refuses, fearing its power will attract dark creatures.Immediately after, sentient coconut pirates called Kakamora surround the boat and steal the heart, but Maui and Moana retrieve it. Maui agrees to help return the heart to Te Fiti, but only after he reclaims his hook, which is hidden in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, and held by Tamatoa, a giant coconut crab. They successfully retrieve it by tricking Tamatoa. After Maui have his hook, Fearful that returning to fight Te Kā will destroy his hook, Maui abandons Moana. Moana still want to return the heart from the ocean to Te Fiti alone. Maui, having had a change of heart, returns to help Moana. Maui distract the lava demon, and his hook is destroyed in the battle. Realizing that Te Kā is actually Te Fiti without her heart, Moana asks the ocean to clear a path for Te Kā to approach her. She sings a song, asking Te Kā to remember who she truly is, allowing Moana to restore her heart. Te Fiti returns and in gratitude, gives a new canoe to Moana and a new magical hook to Maui before returning to her island form.Moana bids farewell to Maui and returns to her recovering island with Heihei. Later, the villagers begin voyaging and set sail in search of new islands, as Maui and Tala accompany them in their giant hawk and manta ray forms, respectively."
187,Moana,6,12 February 2017,Moana? Vaiana? Maui?,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.In a world... of water and islands... and... in a world of demigods, there lives a girl named Moana. A long time ago, there was an evil force that kept the islanders on the dry land. Suddenly, the heart of the world had kept the secret too long, and there were the chosen one. Does this sound like a fairy tale made by Disney? Well, that is 'cause it is. Moana is a little too sweet, little too deep in the attempt of being cute, funny and amazing. Moana is a good movie. Moana is fun and cute. It could have been a lot better with a more serious matter of conveying the story, the actors and the jokes. This is keeping the movie in the 6,5 barrier instead of jumping up to the good old ""Eight of the great"", speaking of IMDb.In the late days, the animation movies has begun to shape the appearances of the characters as a little nod to the real actor behind. So in here; Dwayne Johnson shines through and gives Maui (and yes, ""The Rock"" is Samoan ((as Maui)) in real life) a solid voice and atmosphere. It is done with such intensity that ""The Peoples Eyebrow"" is projected onto Maui. The production team also gives the character the little ""narcisisstic touch"" that The Rock so shines with, speaking of his proud and hard muscles. That is both fun and good to watch.Nice nod to Raiders Of The Lost Ark 41:30 into the movie. Nice nod to The Abyss with the water as a lifeform... see especially at 1:18 into the movie....and.... you're welcome.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Excellent and fantastic animations. - The actors : They are all animated. Did you miss that? (Dwayne Johnson struggles to keep it simple and believable.) - Entertainment : Yes, it is. Just to see all the nods to Dwayne Johnsons character ""The Rock"" in WWE is funny. All those tattoos.... - Age : 76,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)"
188,Moana,7,5 January 2017,Good but not very memorable.,"""Moana"" it's Disney's latest film that brigs us a new tale involving Polynesian culture. The film it's directed by Rob Clements and John Musker, both have been working with Disney for a long time, and they have brought us some very good films, like ""The Great Mouse Detective"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"" and more. But there seems to be something missing in ""Moana"", the film itself it's quite good but fails to captivate it's audience or surprise them with anything new. It doesn't take any chances, and it's not very memorable.The best element in the film it's the animation, but it's Disney, so I was expecting that the animation would at least be mesmerizing to me, the voice acting it's quite good too, the Spanish dub it's very well made but it has something lacking, maybe the translation was very difficult for them, so they forced a few words into the script or the song lyrics, which it's expected when you translate musicals.The characters are fleshed out pretty well, there isn't one unlikeable character in the film, there isn't even a villain, and I like that, but when it comes to characters I would say that some of them, like the rooster, are useless and forgettable, they are only there as a comedic relief, another flaw it's that the character motivations are not very solid, and they could have used a bit more time to flesh them out, but I would say that the finished product it's quite decent. It has a few issues with it's directing and pacing, sometimes it goes very fast and doesn't let the moment sink in for you to actually feel for the characters, but those moments don't last very long and they aren't badly made overall.The songs are quite good, very catchy and quite riveting, they did a very good job at balancing them, the film it's quite entertaining, it isn't boring, it's actually quite engaging, and it's quite sad at moments, it made me feel very nostalgic for those days when I would watch a Disney film with my cousins and enjoy them with the mindset of a child, ready for new adventures with each tale Disney's films brought us.I would say that children will like this movie, but the parents are the ones that will truly enjoy the film for it's merits and filmmaking itself, but it's quite far from great.Overall, I definitely recommend this film, maybe it will do wonders for you, I am not very pleased with the final result, but I can't say that it was bad."
189,Moana,8,30 November 2016,"A fun, beautifully animated adventure.","2016 was a pretty good year for animation films and what a great way to end it with Moana! This film didn't seem as interesting as it actually turned out to be and that's what made it stronger most likely. First, the animation is top notch and since the setting is set in fictional Pacific islands, you can count on gorgeous colors and fantastic landscapes. It would be beautiful in and of itself to watch this film with just music to it since every frame is a work of meticulous art. The music is also very entertaining to listen to although you won't be getting ""Let if Go"" out of your heads; not with this one at least.The story itself is one kids and adults can get into and has very relatable things like independence, adventure, self-worth, identity, and so on. Every portion of the film presents something new and interesting to hold interest and keep you wondering what will come next. The ending is predictable but that shouldn't be a problem for the younger audience. At times, the pacing and story structure get a little jumbled and confused which makes some transitions through scenes a bit rougher. For the most part, however, it's a smooth ride and an enjoyable one at that. Moana is highly recommended as a great addition to the Disney family recently. Not the best you've ever seen but certainly an enjoyable one you wouldn't mind watching more than once."
190,Moana,8,20 December 2016,Surprising,"My daughter really wanted to see this, I wasn't that keen. But OK, let's do it. Got to say I was pleasantly surprised and again, I was pleased that 'princess' Moana didn't define herself through another's eyes. I'm not sure how many more independent feisty princesses Disney can release, but it's not tired yet.The characters are lovable, funny and cute. The message is simple and the story is easy to follow. Visually it's beautiful, and the songs were brilliant and catchy.Plus, how can you not enjoy The Rock doing a solo-song?I'd watch it again, I enjoyed it!"
191,Moana,9,13 December 2016,A beautiful addition to the collection,"I'm so glad when Disney select a theme, culture or population and tell an interesting story with it. This film reminds me a lot of the old Disney movies (Mulan, Hercules) as well as the new ones (Frozen, Wreck it Ralph). It's got a spunky, feisty heroine, a funny lovable sidekick (Maui), breathtakingly beautiful animation, ear wormy songs (You're welcome!) and accurate depiction of different cultures.The only thing it lacked, however, was a good villain. Tamatoa, the giant Smaug-like crab who sings like a glam rock artist, hardly gets any screen time to ""shine"". Which is a shame, since he seemed like a pretty good character. Definitely a good movie to watch when you're depressed. ;)"
192,Moana,10,11 December 2016,Moannnna!,"This animation has a wonderful story line that I found adventurous and captivating! So I get that this animation might be standard Disney formula, which some perceive as predictable and boring, but here's what I feel sets this story apart from some typical Disney films. Moana, the heroine, is NOT a princess. She is destined to be chief. Rarely (if ever), has there been a female chief in ancient Polynesia, and I loved that Disney made this happen! Moana doesn't fall in love with a prince or meet a handsome warrior. She meets mischievous Maui, who actually gives her lots of grief at first, but eventually empowers her. I enjoyed how their relationship develops and that it didn't have to be romantic to be interesting. Also, not to spoil anything, but keep an eye out for hidden Easter eggs throughout! We spotted a couple of homages to Big Hero 6 and Frozen. Clever!The story incorporates the historical legends of Maui, and I personally have a deep appreciation for Polynesian history and culture. My family and I were excited when we discovered Disney was coming out with an animation about the Polynesian superman, aka Maui, aka demigod. Of course, Disney may have Disnified some aspects or left out some details about the legend, but the song ""You're Welcome"" summed up several of Maui's accomplishments in various versions of the myth. We found the tale fascinating and the characters moving, even that silly chicken! The story is set in a fictitious Polynesian island, perhaps in likeness to Samoa or Tokelauan. The music was rhythmic and catchy. We downloaded the soundtrack right after the movie and have been enjoying it!"
193,Moana,8,11 December 2016,Typical Disney magic and incredible debuts!,"So Disney makes a much needed return to Polynesia since Lilo & Stitch being a vibrant and lush part of the world to set any story in; and with Disney being Disney they know exactly how to make use of that remarkable world. We're planted in an ancient era of myth and tradition far away from technology, where legends, curses and demigods still exist setting the scene for a typical adventure. The world as they know it is under threat and only under certain conditions can this be stopped and of those conditions Moana has to go against her over protective father and tribal chief, and leave the island, which has been forbidden. Introducing Auli'i Cravalho as the youngest Disney Princess at the age of 14, and her acting debut! Apparently being the last of a very long audition process she was the one who won them over with her fearless and playful wit who didn't seem to falter under pressure sharing a lot of qualities of the character of Moana. She's amazing and no one would guess this is not only her first film, but her first screen appearance full stop. No reality TV, or music videos, but here with Moana straight in at the deep end performing her own songs too. Have to say, quite a daring choice not having the experience and taking the title role to have Disney invest in Cravalho but by Te Fiti, it was a worthy risk. Now she has to find and enlist the help of Maui, the egotistical, self righteous and self obsessed Demigod who's obviously played by Dwayne Johnson. Though not his first Disney outing, it is his animated debut and even though it's reported he was quite self conscious, citing voice acting to be the hardest form of the art, he done an amazing job, and HE CAN SING! The Rock, Hobbs and the Scorpion King treating us to a medley, making it his debut musical as well. They capture Johnson's mannerisms and movements really well, including his trademark People's Eyebrow adding to the few Disney Easter eggs to look out for that reference many of Disney's and Musker/Clements' work. I would love to see behind the scenes purely for this, to watch and hear this gigantic man singing away, and to see the chemistry between Cravalho and himself. Can you imagine how intimidating it might have been for her, not only being entirely new but to share a platform with the people's champion. She was clearly in good, big hands and I believe the film reflects that. There appears to be a good understanding for the ancient ways of the Polynesian ancestors displaying navigation by way of the nightsky and the currents, and their profound respect for nature and the spirit of the ocean, seeing them as deities that provide them with life and meaning. Ron Clements and John Musker, the geniuses behind Disney classics like Treasure Planet, The Little Mermaid and a personal favourite, Aladdin direct, though they're not directing alone so credit also to Big Hero 6 directors Chris Williams and Don Hall who I'm assuming was mostly responsible for the CGI animation being a good mixture of the two resulting in beautiful , magical animation that urges me to return to Disney World so bad! There's plenty to watch with the typical mascots that brings the story together, Maui's honest and silent tattoo and Heihei, the blundering chicken that provides a lot of the comedy of the story. But, there's wasn't enough screen time for the others. I wanted to see more of the coconuts as an example. Something else it lacked was empathy, I didn't feel totally connected to the characters as I did with other Disney characters and I can't really explain why. It's just I didn't feel sad enough at the points of the story where I should have. There was a tease of a good score from Mark Macina with an intro that immediately reminded me of The Lion King opening, that I use to purposefully play upon waking up in the morning. Naturally, the songs are good with some instant recognisable sing-a-long tracks like ""You're Welcome"", ""How Far Will I Go"" and ""Shiny"" that sounds influenced by Bowie. It's of the usual high standard Disney provides, dazzling animation, funny characters with a strong moral message about brave ambition. Its highly entertaining and I have no doubt majority of kids will love it, especially Heihei the chicken.

194,Moana,8,10 December 2016,How Far I'll Go.,"I recently saw this film at the cinema, I was completely blown away. So much so that I went to watch it again the next day. Moana is spectacular, Disney has moved away from princesses and love for this film. It was about adventure and culture no longer about marriage and princes. It was about a journey, a journey for Moana to find the 'job' she can do best for her village without upsetting her father. I'm hoping that they continue no longer focusing on this aspect.The songs featured in Moana were powerful they expressed willingness for the main protagonist to travel in order to help her island survive.I would highly recommend this film to any ages, it mixes humour and serious matters within the plot line so well."
195,Moana,8,9 December 2016,I hate Disney but this was a great movie,"First off, I hate Disney animations except for Pixar who I do not really consider to be Disney. I especially hate Disney Princess movies. I hated Frozen. Evidently I am the only person on earth who did, but I hated it. Now with all that said I really liked this movie. It was a wonderfully pleasant surprise. The music by Lin-Manuel Miranda is amazing. The voice acting is first rate. The young lady who voices Moana is terrific and Dwayne Johnson continues to show his amazing abilities and range as an actor and entertainer. The story is also a surprise. It is not overbearing and heavy handed like most Disney animations. I also like the way it makes fun of other Disney princess movies. So I highly recommend this, even if you are a Disney hater like me."
196,Moana,9,8 December 2016,Moana is Magnificent,"The most recent animated film by Disney is entitled ""Moana"" about a Polynesian princess. She lives on a South Pacific Island. Don't know if it's Hawaiian or Polynesian but a major character is named Maui (played by Dwayne the Rock Johnson) as a demigod. Moana is the village chief's daughter. Her grandmother has a tattoo on her back of a stingray. She plans to return as one of them. The animation is first rate with beautiful colors especially the ocean. Moana was the chosen one to return the heart to another island. Tattoos especially on Maui are part of the picture as well. Moana is a likable girl who chooses to follow her heart to the sea and set things right in for her village. I especially liked the beginning of Moana as a young child. The grandmother does a terrific job as the crazy village lady. I enjoyed the colorful graphics and the film's story line. Unlike other Disney films, Moana doesn't have a love interest. Her relationship with Maui was friendship throughout."
197,Moana,9,5 December 2016,Moana Is A Hit,"Disney has produced another hit with ""Moana."" Playing the title role, Auli'i Cravalho is a princess of a South Pacific island. Kind, intelligent, brave and adventurous, her desire to see what is beyond her island home is impeded by her father's warnings of the dangers that are out in the deep ocean and Cravalho's duty to stay home and learn how to be the next chief of the people. She reluctantly gives up her dream of sailing into the ocean far from homeuntil the plant and fish that Cravalho's people depend on to survive either die off or disappear.Learning of an ancient tale of a demigod named Maui (voiced by Dwayne Johnson) who stole a precious stone that provided life to the ocean and islands, Cravalho goes on a treacherous journey to find Johnson and force him to put the stone back; and hope that would bring balance, peace, and life back to her world. There will be many challenges for the young princess: she lacks knowledge of deep ocean sailing; she has a mentally challenged chicken as a stowaway; Johnson does not share Cravalho's eagerness to return the stone back to where it belongs; a swarm of tiny, coconut-headed pirates roam the ocean; Johnson's magic hook must be taken from a giant crab who will not give it up so easily; and a fearsome god made of lava guards the entrance to where the stone must be returned. Yup, it's going to take a team of brilliant writers to get her through all this! My most memorable, movie moment of ""Moana"" is the scene when the princess gets a visit from her grandmother at a time when the princess is at her lowest, ready to give up and go home. It is a touching scene, especially to viewers who have lost a loved one and believe that our spirits go on, and one day we will see them again.Fully realized, likable characters; a great story; positive messages; amazing animation; scenes that are very funny and scenes that put a lump in your throat; catchy songsthese are all present in ""Moana."" Bottom line, it's a great movie that adults will enjoy with their children because, like most Disney movies, it just makes you feel better about life.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
198,Moana,10,5 December 2016,Always have and always will be singing Disney.,"I cannot explain how amazing this film was! The songs are honestly so great and the whole film is just so cute! It's heart touching and I just can't wait until it's on Netflix so I can see it again. It has humor as well, I had a good laugh at times. I know this is supposed to be a ""kids film"" but I'd watch this into my 90's. Coming from New Zealand I really feel Moana was the most relatable Disney movie I've seen, considering Maui pulled NZ up out of the ocean. I know this isn't the first Disney movie with a princess (or in this case, chief's daughter) of colour, but I feel like this was really the most connected to the culture."
199,Moana,10,5 December 2016,"Loved it so much, I saw it again the next day","Disney's latest animated gambit, ""Moana"" details the story of the eponymous character's quest to restore her island, where she is the chief's daughter, to its former state of natural beauty. To do this, she must find the demigod, Maui and sail him across the sea to restore the heart of Te Fiti, a goddess whose stone possesses the power to create life. Quite simply, ""Moana"" is exquisite. From the very beginning (in which the history of the film is told) to the very end (where Tamatoa accuses the audience of loving him more if he were named Sebastian), the movie is visually stunning and has a well-crafted nature of storytelling. The titular protagonist follows much the same formula as most Disney heroes do, but Moana is endearing and lovable enough for the audience to forget that as they watch her on her journey. The voice actress, 14 (now 16) year old Auli'i Cravalho, gives a competent voice performance given that it was her very first. Her singing vocals are impeccable and, since learning she never received professional training, I was more impressed with her performances. The screenplay is very well done and the characters are given lots of opportunities for humour, a lot of them being via repetition. A particular standout is Moana's animal companion, Heihei the chicken who is quite simply one of the best parts of the movie. The songs are catchy and excellently written: ""How Far I'll Go"" should go down as one of the greatest Disney songs ever written and performed in my opinion. Never have I listened to a Disney song more than this one. Move over, Frozen, Moana is coming. All in all, this movie is a wonderful effort by Disney, made more pleasing by the lack of Caucasian characters. The all-Polynesian cast and characters were refreshing to watch, especially given Disney not-too-stellar reputation with diversity. I would happily consider this my favourite Disney animation of all time because it would definitely deserve such a title. All I can say is make sure you watch this film, because it does not disappoint."
200,Moana,8,4 December 2016,'Moana' - Another Classic hit by Walt Disney Animations,"Unwilling to fix what ain't broke, Disney hews pretty closely to its usual narrative structure in ""Moana,"" while at the same time further expanding its geographical boundaries far from the original Germanic fairy tales that provided the studio's stories for so many decades. Rather than revel in the South Seas kitsch that gave us the Enchanted Tiki Room, this adventure pays fitting tribute to both the natural beauty and the creation myths of the Pacific Islands. If we're looking at the journey and not the destination, ""Moana"" is thoroughly entertaining if never completely groundbreaking. Moana does what is needed for a good Disney film. With outstanding Visual effects and good musical score, Moana will definitely make its nomination in Best Animated Picture in Oscars. I go with 4/5 for beautifully made Walt Disney creation 'Moana'."
201,Moana,8,2 December 2016,Songs that will touch your heart!,"Disney never seems to fail in amazing me. Whenever you feel that this again would be similar to what we have seen before and there Disney is with yet another unique concept.Moana is a story of a young girl who sails through the sea to find a demigod Maui, who will help her to save her island. It is a musical which has great songs (reminded me of Frozen) and heart touching background score. The story is simple but sensible and amazingly executed. It is NOT a spoiler, there is a chicken which made me laugh so hard tears fell from my eyes. Moana is a perfect blend of everything important for an animated movie to be likable and enjoyed by all. This is definitely one of the best Disney has delivered. Watch this movie if you like, well, just watch this movie I am sure you will like it."
202,Moana,7,27 November 2016,Fun and Cute but Empty Musically Speaking..,"Disney seems to have this problem of releasing movies in a Hit-Miss-Hit-Miss pattern. Moana is on the *miss* portion of the pattern. The story line is fine, centered around a young girl on her adventure to help fix the planet (by your powers combined I ... AM... ) But it lacks a good musical track, with none of the extravagantly theatrical work you find in Frozen, Aladdin, Lion King, etc...My kids loved the movie's action, but they won't remember much else years down the road. Not the way everyone can sing all the words to ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" or ""Jack the Pumpkin King"" 20 years afterwards. Why Disney put such little effort into the musical score is beyond me.. and it's such a shame."
203,Moana,10,25 January 2017,The Avatar of Animated Films,"This Film looks incredibly beautiful! In the first ~5 minutes I teared up! The score is beautiful, the songs (You can really feel the participation of Lin Manuel Miranda!), the animations and it's all very authentic! I loved this movie.The comparison to Avatar comes easily, because the only thing this movie is missing is a complex story, still the storytelling is fantastic! I can promise you, whoever you are, you will love this! It's beautiful in every way!The Oscar nominations are absolutely deserved and I can only hope they'll get at least 1 (Best animated film/best original song)!The humor was cute and subtly done, and got me laughing a few times! go watch it, you won't regret it!"
204,Moana,9,10 January 2017,A New Timeless Classic From Disney,"Moana is the latest in a slew of CG animated movies from Disney, with Tangled, Frozen, and Zootopia preceding it, so needless to say I had some very high expectations for Moana. Were they fulfilled? Absolutely!Let's talk about the characters first. Moana, the teenage daughter of the village Chief, who wants nothing more than to leave her island and explore the sea, but can't because her father won't let her, but the plants start dying and the fish disappear, she takes it upon herself to go out to sea, find the demigod, Maui, and restore the heart of Te Fiti to restore her village. I have a new favorite Disney princess. Moana is an absurdly likable and relatable character who never plays the role of the typical, annoying, immature teenager. I liken her to being kind of like Ariel, from The Little Mermaid, but much better written. Maui, the powerful demigod who has lost his magic fishhook, is a complete jerk and I love him for it. Dwayne Johnson's undeniable charm and humor shines through even in this arrogant, selfish, and egotistical character. Speaking of performances, this is the debut of an outstanding new talent in Auli'i Cravalho. She absolutely kills it as Moana, not only standing alongside Dwayne Johnson, but even sometimes outperforming him. I really do hope for a very successful career for this incredibly talented young actress. Did I mention her singing voice?The music in Moana is also amazing. Lin-Manuel Miranda composes this movie to perfection. I could listen to this soundtrack all day, though two songs in particular stand out: How Far I'll Go and You're Welcome. These are arguably some of the best songs to come out of Disney in the past 20 years. Now to talk about the aesthetic qualities. This is one of the most beautiful animated movies I have ever seen. Everything seems so vibrant and alive, it seems magical, which any proper Disney picture should be.Overall, I had a great time watching Moana. I think it has a good message, very likable characters, a phenomenal soundtrack, and gorgeous visuals. Don't miss this one.The End"
205,Moana,8,6 January 2017,Only beaten by Zootopia,"Two words: beautiful, spellbinding. This is perhaps among Disney's best since their venture into 3D animation, with the most spectacular animation I've seen in any film. The beauty of the visual effects was complemented by the well-written plot and songs, the gorgeous voice of Auli'i Cravalho, and the typical Disney comic relief through Heihei and Pua. My only criticism could be two things: there were a few moments that seemed slightly mis-paced, such as Maui's defeat by Te Ka, learning to use his hook again and the appearance of Gramma's ghost, which all seem to have been rushed elements of the plot. Further, some of the characters and plot points seem slightly cliché - however, the clichéd plot elements can be forgiven thanks to the exploration of a largely unnoticed culture on Earth, the spellbinding music, and the fantastic animation. Dwayne Johnson was a pleasant surprise in the role of Maui. Originally, I was concerned that he did not suit the style of the character, nor the typical voice actor that Disney animation movies needed. But, he lived up to the role and then some. Maui was funny, lovable and bad-ass, and he added so much to the film through his joking arrogance and humour. This is, in my opinion, Disney's second-greatest modern animation. While it doesn't appeal in the same manner as ""Frozen"", I feel that it was better-executed and more entertaining than the major blockbuster. For me, only ""Zootopia"" rivals ""Moana"" in Disney's new era of incredible 3D computer animations."
206,Moana,9,22 December 2016,A journey of discovery unlike any other,"After ""Frozen"", comes a ""summer-like"" Disney movie that is unlike any other animated movie you have seen. From the ""extremely"" real sensation and color of the water, to the uplifting songs and breath-taking animation, the movie is a real ocean ride that never loses steam. Multi-layered throughout as it deals with concepts of ""community"", ""roots"", ""exploration"" and ""faulty-parental guidance"" Even the characters sound real given an exceptionally smart script that makes you forget at some point that you are watching an animation, thanks to a fast paced and meticulous plot that has more than one surprise embedded in it. Truly a must see in every sense of the word."
207,Moana,8,20 December 2016,Stunning,"In all honesty, I enjoyed this movie more than Frozen. Perhaps that's due to the amount of times I've heard Let it Go in the past three years, but nonetheless, I believe Moana knocks it out of the park. The unique narrative and stunning animations alone make it outstanding. Not to mention, my inner Hamilton nerd was freaking out at the parts when I heard Lin Manuel Miranda sing. The characters are intriguing, and I think Moana herself is among one of my favorite Disney princesses (even if she doesn't technically qualify). She has a fierce personality, and it's clear Disney wanted to present a strong-female-lead. And they did so in a way that wasn't in your face about it (as many movies do). I was also surprised at how well Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson did in his role as Maui. I never knew the guy could sing, but I was greatly surprised. The flaws I found in the movie are very nit-picky, but I think they deserve to be brought up. For one, a lot of the characters seem to change their minds on things a lot quicker than I expected, and it was kind of jarring, in particular, Maui's character had a weird change of heart in the story that felt out of place. I also wasn't a huge fan of Hay-hay, the chicken sidekick. Was kind of hoping they stuck with the pig. But all in all, I highly recommend checking this film out."
208,Moana,9,19 December 2016,"Not ordinary, and rich in culture","Evolving with the times, Disney. Well done. Moana is not a princess, but the future Chief of her people. Incredible the lack of basic comprehension among some of the reviewers here. Also, if you are incapable of enjoying culture, you won't enjoy -for example- the film's unique afri-tropical sounds and elements of tribal mysticism. ""Moana"" will expand your child's cultural repertoire and appreciation of the elements that unite humanity.A must see for the whole family!"
209,Moana,8,9 December 2016,Moana,"I heard about this latest computer animated offering from Walt Disney Studios a few times, long before its release, I was unsure what to make of it at first, but trailer and highly positive critic reviews convinced me to go with it. Basically teenager Moana Waialiki (Auli'i Cravalho) is the only daughter of Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison) on the small Polynesian island of Motunui, as a young girl she was chosen by the ocean to receive the heart of island goddess Te Fiti, a small pounamu stone. For years Moana has been fascinated by the sea and longs to escape her island to discover new things, her over protective father Tui and mother Sina (Nicole Scherzinger) insist the island has everything they ever need, including fish, coconuts and vegetation. However fish become scarce, the coconut growth is spoiled, and vegetables are dying, Moana proposes that the people go beyond the island reef to find new resources, Tui angrily rejects her request, sailing beyond the reef is forbidden, Sina explains that Tui fears the ocean because he lost his best friend who attempted to sail beyond the reef. Moana's grandmother Gramma Tala (Rachel House) has told Moana the story of goddess Te Fiti, in the last millennium her heart was stolen by the demigod Maui (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), who was planning to give it to humanity as a gift, but lava demon Te Kā confronted him, the heart was lost to the ocean, found by Moana a century later, and Maui disappeared. Moana makes a failed attempt, going against her father, to sail away from the reef, then she finds Tala has fallen ill, in her dying breath she tells Moana to set sail, she departs and is on a mission to find Maui, so that he can restore the heart back to Te Fiti, dumb pet rooster Heihei (A Knight's Tale's Alan Tudyk) is her stowaway companion, while a manta ray, implied to be Tala's reincarnation, follows Moana. Moana follows a constellation that looks like Maui's fishhook, but she is knocked unconscious by a typhoon, she wakes next morning on a small island, inhabited by Maui, he is not interested in returning to Motunui, he distracts her boasting about his exploits, trapping her in a cave and stealing her sailboat, but she escapes and returns to him. Moana tries to convince Maui to help her restore her island to its former glory, but he fears that other dark creatures will be attracted by its power, but following an attack by pygmy pirates called Kakamora, he agrees to bring the heart back, but he needs his powerful hook in order to do so. They travel to the Realm of Monsters, Maui believes the hook is being held in the treasure cave of the giant coconut crab named Tamatoa (Jemaine Clement), they manage to retrieve the hook by tricking Tamatoa into singing of his glamour. Back on the sailboat, Maui teaches Moana how to sail and navigate using the stars, and with Moana's encouragement Maui reacquaints with the power of his hook, including transformation into animals, she learns that he is not a god, he was a human raised by gods after being abandoned by his parents. They arrive at Te Fiti, where Te Kā appears and tries to destroy them, the monster is too strong, Moana ignores Maui's instruction to turn back, believing she can use Te Kā's aversion to water to their advantage, but the island is damaged and Maui's hook is severely damaged, angered and fearing his hook will be destroyed Maui abandons Moana, before he leaves he tells her the ocean chose the wrong person to save her people. Moana is distraught by her failure and begs the ocean to take the heart and choose someone else to return it, the spirit of Tala encourages her not to give up and find strength within herself, Moana's hope is restored, she swims down to retrieve the heart and starts to sail back. Moana is able to pass Te Kā, and Maui returns, having had a change of heart, his hook is destroyed in battle with the monster, but Moana realises that Te Kā is in fact Te Fiti, angered and without her heart, the ocean parts so she can approach her. Moana restores the heart, and Te Fiti returns, the island blossoms and resources are restored, and in gratitude Moana receives a new canoe and Maui a new hook, before slumbering in peace. Moana and Maui bid a fond farewell, Moana returns to her parents and the people, and the villagers are encouraged to set sail in search of new islands, Maui accompanies them in his hawk form. Cravalho has a beautiful singing voice and voices the title character very well, Johnson is splendid as the wise-cracking legendary shape-shifting demigod, and surprisingly good at singing as well. The animation is fantastic, it is good to have another female leading character (like Brave and Frozen), especially one not looking for or finding love, it a sweet and charming tale with themes of tribal tradition and culture, with exciting, funny and heart-warming scenes, and terrific songs, especially ""You're Welcome"" and ""How Far I'll Go"", a highly entertaining animated musical fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year and Best Original Song for ""How Far I'll Go"" (also nominated for the Golden Globe), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Very good!"
210,Moana,7,4 December 2016,Well... uhm ...,"First i have to say .. I LOVE Disney. I am 26 and you are never too old for Disney. I know the classic, Pocahontas and the Little Mermaid are my favorite movies. From the new collection The Princess and the Frog is my favorite. Everything is just right in that movie. The characters, the story, the music, the setting etc. And now Moana, Vaiana called in my country. I was expecting a lot but unfortunately i didn't enjoyed it much. It has a slow start and the didn't feel a friendship chemistry between Moana and the demigod. Also too much songs out of nowhere. Moana is a strong and bolt girl, which is good. But i was bored at the half of the movie. Also it reminded me a little of Frozen :O. The island, the island people are great. Very lovely to see. A plus also for the animation. My friends asked me to watch Moana again but i said no. I didn't wanted to miss out of a football game over this film."
211,Moana,8,28 November 2016,"Cool Disney Princess, in a great story (Does not hurt to have The Rock in your corner)","I'm gonna go out on the limb and say the Rock may have had some influence on this movie being made. That at least someone at Disney who was a fan of Dwayne Johnson, saw his Samoan heritage and said we should make a movie about a Pacific Island Demigod so he can voice it.Moana will charm the paints off of you. It puts a smile on your face that does not go away.Can't help but to compare this Disney Princess with the one from Brave. They have a lot in common being strong female princesses capable of slaying there own dragon, but I like Moana better because she stands even more differently than most Disney princesses, and Not just because of the color of her skin. This movie was never about a girl who had to prove herself to some man, it's not a love story, it's about a young person wanting something more than what her safety zone can give her, a good lesson for both daughters and sons. Plus, I like how Disney does a little poke at itself addressing the stereotypes of Disney Princesses always being in dresses and having a animal sidekick, In this case, Moana is joined on her journey by a bird brained chicken who can't tell the difference between a rock and food.Oh, and speaking of the Rock, let's get back to him and how awesome he was in this flick as Maui, a egotistical trickster spending too much time talking about how amazing he is. With any other voice he would be a jerk, but not in the hands of Mr. Johnson. The Rock even gives us a classic Disney song that has been stuck in my head for days now.The animation was very good in this film as well. Typical of Disney movies they try to respect the culture that they are taking the story from, which oddly gives it the essence of another Disney animated feature about a Demigod, Hercules. Very similar with animation upon animation coming to life (But instead of carvings from a Greek temple it's , Maui's tattoos that have a personality all on it's own).Absolutely worth every dime to see it in 3D too. The movie is big just like the water they sail across and it's big like the bad guys they face, and you want to see that in a big theater.Worth checking out."
212,Moana,8,28 November 2016,A link between worlds,"I confess to being predisposed toward Disney's latest animated feature thanks to my adoration for The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. Like that classic video game adventure, Moana is all about the epic wonder of the rolling ocean, and the primal and mystical forces that flow between its precious islands. There are also hints of Hayao Miyazaki  especially Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke  in its strong heroine and its concerns with humanity's impact on the environment.Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) is being groomed to become chief of her Polynesian paradise of Motunui. Yet Moana is drawn to the sea and what lies beyond the horizon. In an elegant prologue, we see an infant Moana protecting a turtle as it waddles toward the ocean. Suddenly the water itself comes alive like Aladdin's carpet (this film is also directed by Ron Clements and John Musker). So we know straight away that Moana has a special understanding with the ocean, as well as an innate empathy with nature.Less so, Maui (Dwayne Johnson). He's a demigod who stole the heart of Te Fiti, the goddess who created all life. Now a corruption is creeping through the islands. Moana's dad believes that she has a duty to stay and protect her people. But Moana's grandmother feels for her wanderlust, and encourages her to follow her instinct  an instinct which tells her to set sail and find Maui, bring him to Te Fiti, and return the goddess's heart. Obviously this is the choice Moana makes, and her adventure takes her far beyond the safe coral of her homeland.Moana begins as a leader (not a princess, she insists), with her parents pulling her away from her calling. It's the classic duty versus individuality conflict, mostly rendered without black and white moralising. ""Find happiness where you are"" is the repeated mantra of the islanders  but the story's ultimate message is that such domestic happiness can only be maintained by respectfully communicating with foreign lands. (If only, humanity, if only.)Technically speaking, Moana gives us a new level of detail in CG animation. Not just in the texture rendering but in the nuance of the animation itself. The living sea  snaking like the probe in James Cameron's The Abyss  is full of wordless charisma. The general art style is nicely aligned with classic Disney 2D, except the extra dimension feels necessary to embellish the breadth of the setting.The pacing is near-perfect. By now, Disney Animation Studios probably have an algorithm for the ideal narrative structure. But heck  if they do, it's working. From the myth-building first act and the character interplay of the second; from the moment of self-doubt to the final (very touching) showdown: it's pleasingly predictable and entirely satisfying. That structural predictability allows for some fantastically bizarre setpieces along the way. Personal favourites are the attack of the Kakamora, where the movie suddenly turns into Fury Road for kids; and the Realm of Monsters, which movingly updates the weird 80s fantasy environments of films like The Legend of Sirius, and then throws in a giant glam-shelled Jermaine Clement to do a David Bowie impression.The interplay between Moana and Maui, which constitutes the drama and humour of the middle section, is smartly written and full of sparks. Being a demigod, Maui is a raging narcissist, so Moana quickly realises that persuading him to do the right thing requires an appeal to his ego  an ego which bellows godliness while whispering a fundamental vulnerability. Moana herself has the goofy appeal of the modern Disney heroine. Going deeper, her internal conflict isn't original but nor does it feel forced. Johnson and newcomer Cravalho deliver excellent voice work, some of which requires belting out lung-busting songs. Moana's theme may not be Disney's catchiest number but it sure is stirring. Joining the adventurers is a doolally rooster named Heihei. He's the slapstick cartoon element, narratively pointless but occasionally amusing. Perhaps he was inserted for younger children, because the rest of the humour is more subtle. I particularly enjoyed Maui's bromance with his living tattoo, acting as a kind of pectoral-based conscience beside his heart.Moana is up there with the best of this Golden Age of American Animation, which shows no sign of dwindling. It is extraordinarily well made and efficient, big-hearted, and achingly beautiful. Familiar elements abound, but they're remixed into an original setting with a rich mythology. Combined with thoughtful characterisation and a highly laudable (and, depressingly, an endlessly relevant) message, Moana will be seen and savoured for years to come."
213,Moana,10,26 November 2016,Amazing. Simply amazing,"This is definitely a great Disney film. It's the best Hawaiian Disney film I've seen since Lilo and Stitch. It has an amazing story to it about a young princess named Moana who also becomes a hero by saving the world from total destruction with the help of the Polynesian demigod Maui. Of course we hear Maui's backstory of how he became a demigod. He was a mortal child who was abandoned by his parents and then the Polynesian gods made him for what he is now. Maui is an awesome character too and funny and Dwayne Johnson did an excellent performance of him. I also liked the chicken Hei Hei. He's funny too. The pig was cute too. One character that I found odd though was this giant crab named Tamatoa. He was very weird looking and a bit scary for children. Of course he's also voiced by Jemaine Clement from Flight of the Conchords who also voiced Nigel the cockatoo in Rio. That's a Non-Disney film by the way. He had a good song too. Of course all of the songs were brilliant in this including one of my favorites Opetaia Foa'i We Know the Way. I also loved Maui's song You're Welcome. Also Moana's grandmother and Moana's ancestors were just like Mufasa, cause they helped Moana remember who she was and then she went off to save the world, by confronting Te Ka who is really Te Fiti by returning her heart of pounamu to her which was stolen by Maui cause he wanted every mortal of the Pacific Islands to love him and she is restored to her old self and then everyone on Moana's island is allowed to sail the seas again as their ancestors did years ago. Great Disney film here and I so recommend this to anyone who has children."
214,Moana,7,24 November 2016,"Good, but not Great","Moana, the successor to the mega hit, Frozen; this may be where the problem lies. However, as an adult viewer, I also have my own personal expectations for a film. This film created a beautiful world for us to live in for a short time. The work put into the film really shows in the visuals. The sea looked inviting and the village seemed joyful and welcoming as well. The story was told well with playful stabs at Disney's track record of formulas. While I didn't have a problem with Moana, I was not challenged. This film was very safe and didn't feel like it wanted to take risks. I like a movie to make me think and have a dialog about something. Frozen, while I believe is far over-hyped, did challenge itself and made a narrative in a new shape and style. This film, while avoiding typical love interests, did not make me walk away from the film with anything to discuss. It happened. It was good. I had fun, but that was it. Great movies do not end there. Great movies have something to say that pesters you on the way out of the theater. This movie makes you dig for something to force a conversation about. If you are going to see this with younger kids, they will love it, but you will probably not have the same reaction."
215,Moana,10,14 January 2017,You don't have to be a child to enjoy,"Moana another classic Disney can add to their library.While watching Moana I sat back and reflected on how much Disney movies have changed from what use to be classics when I was younger, Such as Mulan. The attention and amount of detail in modern Disney is outstanding and blows me away too this day.Now the ""review"" 😂. Moana a movie filled with amazing vocals, wonderful acting and outstanding visuals. The film captures Polynesian culture in a beautiful manner. The environment is done so well that after first sight the audience is engaged immediately. The musical aspect really triggers your emotional side. With songs that have very strong meanings and outrageously good voices behind. The technical ability of the film is pushing boundaries into a future I can not wait for. With story telling that grabs your heart and triggers every emotion on the spectrum.This is a must see for anyone that loves animation and high up on the list for those that love film."
216,Moana,10,24 June 2017,You wanna see Moana!,"Everything about this film is incredible and enchanting in a very refreshing way. Instant classic and must see! The cinematography and CGI's are nothing short of stunning. You will honestly be mesmerized minute by minute as much as you will laugh at the truly humorous parts and there are quite a few of them! I won't give it away, but honestly the attention to detail and brilliance won my heart completely.Dwayne The Rock Johnson is dynamic and just showcased yet another side to him that we will not forget, but will hold him adoringly in our hearts. Like Olaf gave Frozen its lustre and comedic relief....Maui stole the scenes with his electric personality and contagious and lively presence. What can I say....you're welcome!"
217,Moana,10,24 June 2017,Disney does it again. Brilliant.,"I am amazed reading other people's reviews who say this movie is anything but amazing. I guess it goes to show that some people just need something to complain about. For an adult to say this movie is boring is somewhat comical seems how it's a kids movie. I however found this movie more than entertaining. My 2 year old loves it. The music is amazing, the colors are amazing, the acting is amazing, the messages are amazing, what more could you ask for in a day and age where violence and sex seems to flood the industry. If you are looking for a beautiful entertaining movie for all ages then look no further."
218,Moana,9,4 June 2017,Great everything,"This movie is fantastic. It has everything you need: drama, humor, great jokes, great voices and singing! This is a story about heroes and anti-heroes, and how they embark on their own journeys to discover themselves. The fact that the story is based on the Polynesian culture and myths seems wonderful to me. I am glad that Disney decided to show us something different. Everything else, the cast, the CGI, the script, is awesomely done. Watch this movie, you will not regret it!"
219,Moana,8,29 May 2017,"Another beautiful, inspiring tale from the minds and hearts of Disney","Moana is the newest addition to the Disney Princess lineup and she does not disappoint. Like the typical Disney princess, she is feisty, determined and absolutely against shelving her dreams or ignoring her ambitions. I really do adore this movie, even though it is not among my favorite Disney Princess films. The character of Moana is very strong and lovable, but I personally felt that this film could have been better and it really does pain me to say that. Thus the 8/10 rating opposed to my 10/10 rating for nearly every other Disney Princess movie.To be fair, poor Moana had to follow Elsa and Anna which is arguably impossible. Nothing that came out right after Frozen was going to do as well and we all knew this. Still, Moana is a delightfully enchanting tale of a young girl who sets sail to save her people from an unknown evil. She certainly has the bravery of all her Disney Princess predecessors! What she does NOT have unfortunately, is a good supporting cast. Not only does Moana not have a GOOD supporting cast...the poor thing doesn't have a supporting cast at all. In fact, I don't think there has ever been a Disney Princess movie prior to this which has so few characters. Sure, she has her parents and grandmother who we see for like four minutes in the beginning and end of the movie. Not much going on there. Then we have the worst animal companions to date (yes, even worse than the useless humming bird and raccoon from Pocahontas) a little pot bellied big and a mentally challenged rooster. Yes, you read that last part right. Neither companion serves any purpose, not even much comic relief which is usually their intention.Then we have the supporting character Maui...who I hope you really like, because it is pretty much just he and Moana on a boat for the entire movie. The Rock delivered an outstanding performance as this character but I simply just didn't care for the character itself that much. I personally would have chosen to have a love interest for Moana guiding her to where she needed to go rather than a somewhat creepy shirtless older dude who is very aggressive to her in most scenes.Now let's talk music. The background music of the film was excellent, as well as Moana's main song ""How Far I'll Go."" It obviously is nowhere near ""Let it Go"" but it is still a truly wonderful song that makes you feel for the character and what she is about to do. But the rest? Very unmemorable...unlike in previous classics like Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid where literally EVERY song was gold, these just were not. The Rock's song was actually kind of cute and catchy and he did a great job with it. But other than these two songs, I was very disappointed.The visuals are stunning, particularly the moon which is reflecting on the water that surrounds Moana. I am telling you, she is on the raft 89% percent of the movie, so brace yourself. Auli'i did a fantastic job voicing and singing for Moana though, especially since she was only 14 years old when she first started filming this. I hope it leads to great things for her, she really deserves it.All of the boring, blah scenes in the middle of the movie are worth the awesome twist at the end. I did not see that coming and I found it very enjoyable and poetic. Despite my critiques, this movie is still definitely a must see, another Disney treasure that you will be sure to hold in your heart forever."
220,Moana,9,15 December 2016,:),"~ Disney Crafts a Cinematic Gem ~To transverse the world in which Moana takes place is undoubtedly an experience of blissful joy. The film's directors (John Musker, Ron Clements) and its animators have constructed the South Pacific in a rather elegant manner  oceans appear almost life-like in color / clarity and the islands themselves are a hypnotic lush green. The byproduct of this polished look is an Island that enthralls the viewer; you feel compelled to plunge amidst this gorgeous world and experience first-hand its bright palette. This in of itself is the magic behind Disney: a superimposed prettiness paralleled with a charming narrative.Seasoned Disney directors John Musker and Ron Clements (The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Hercules) adhere to an already established blueprint: we have a three-dimensional protagonist (Moana) whose overt wanderlust impels her to adventure beyond her Polynesian village in spite of her fathers overprotective nature. Interesting plot developments are made as we see the relationship between Moana and the pretentious demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) evolve. The narrative advances like the typical hero's journey  unique in that we have a teen heroine sans a love interest. Moana consistently hits the mark in that its story is entirely revolved around its heroine  a headstrong Polynesian girl who is unapologetically herself. With Moana, Disney finds itself once again a juggernaut in the world of film."
221,Moana,8,13 December 2016,"""Exciting visuals, high-spirited characters and a rich soundtrack.""","Moana is written & directed by Ron Clements, Don Hall, Chris Williams and John Musker and stars Auli'i Cravalho, Dwayne Johnson, Rachel House, Temuera Morrison and Jemaine Clement.In Ancient Polynesia, when a terrible curse incurred by Maui reaches an impetuous Chieftain's daughter's island, she answers the Ocean's call to seek out the demigod and set things right. Walt Disney Animation Studios are famously known for pictures such as Zootopia, Frozen, Wreck-it Ralph, Snow White, The Lion King and many, many more. But, Moana is different. Something about this film really intrigued me - more than just the animation, as usual - and that was the title character, Moana. She's not a princess, and this is stated by the fiery sea voyaging enthusiast, voiced by Auli'i Cravalho, many times during the film. She has a vast amount of abilities and charisma, with a beautiful array of colourful characters to support her in her calling to save the world. I also noticed that, unlike Frozen, the original songs haven't been so incredibly 'out there' during the film's release. This is something that stopped me from seeing Frozen back in 2013 and to this day I still haven't watched it. I didn't like the music I was hearing, but with Moana it's entirely different. I really enjoyed the songs in this film. They have been carefully placed throughout and wonderfully performed by the cast. I must congratulate Auli'i Cravalho on her successful debut and praise her strong vocal range. There's a real cherishable warmth present and it only gives more to the delightful story. Dwayne Johnson is a surprising addition to the list of memorable moments from this film. His character, Maui is hugely energetic, adding a fun and witty shade to the bond between himself and Moana. The supporting cast also did a terrific job of bringing their characters to life, highlighting Rachel House as Grandma Tala. As a big fan of animation and having studied it briefly before, I was excited to see Ancient Polynesia come to life with some of the greatest animators working on the project. With a lot of research and delving into the history of Polynesians, the team have done an extraordinary job of crafting and fine-tuning these characters and environments. The animation is smooth and the visuals vibrant, with some subtle details which most may never notice, but eagle-eyed viewers will love.The original score by Mark Mancina is somewhat disappointing, but only in its overall pay- off. The approach is great, using some of the traditional instruments with the support of Opetaia Foa'i's knowledge in the musical background, but these aren't used nearly as well as they should have been. However, the themes are nicely composed and, as aforementioned, the original songs by Foa'i and Lin-Manuel Miranda are basking in tenderness.Simply put, Moana is a blast. Everyone involved has brought something great to the table and it shines through blissfully. I'd like to see more of this world explored in the future. Not so much in a direct sequel, but with the cultural history and environments so gloriously presented in this film, it would be hard to let go. That said, I've always admired Disney's creativity and diversity. Verdict; Moana utilises a fine blend of exciting visuals, high-spirited characters and a rich soundtrack, becoming one of Disney's finest films yet.Moana, 8/10."
222,Moana,9,9 December 2016,Some Good Stuff,"The best part was the giant talking crustacean. They seem to always have a sidetrack like this, some mysterious, amusing diversion.I get irritated when I watch movies for children and see the men possessive of their daughters, even if they just pick them up.I thought Maui was a bad guy or nonessential part of what's important. You may have forgotten what he said, but he was mean to Moana, who I also didn't want to affiliate with, tho. This is probably why the story fell apart for me and I could not recommend it to someone as a 10/10.The rooster was a little cute, but this movie just fell apart so much with the dad and Maui being mad at Moana.After the credits, they show the crustacean at the end saying he could not get up from being left on his back and that people would care if he were red and named Sebastian or something like that."
223,Moana,9,22 November 2016,"Moana takes its viewers on a pleasant vacation to a beautiful island where an abundance of love, smiles and relatable characters await.","There are few films that can take you out of whatever current situation you're in and allow an escape from the world. Moana succeeds in painting a beautiful world of its own while being fun.Upon hearing the news of Dwayne Johnson being onboard for the role of Maui, plenty of people's interests were piqued. Although, the addition of Lin Manuel-Miranda glued this film together. Riding a large wave of success due to his Broadway hit ""Hamilton,"" there isn't a part of this world out of reach for the 36-year-old.Disney films are known for their soundtracks and catchy ballads, but, man, Moana is the first Disney film in years that has me humming along to the likes of ""You're Welcome"" and ""How Far I'll Go."" With the original music helmed by Manuel-Miranda Mark Mancina, and Opetaia Foa'i, this film had set a high-ish bar for itself before anyone sat down to witness the final product. The heavy Manuel-Miranda influence on each original musical number bled through the speakers as he took a Broadway vibe and mixed it with a hip-hop flow. ""The Rock"" rapped about eels and coconuts, and it didn't sound zany to sing aloud.The music was nearly perfect, which leaves the bits of dialogue in- between. Disney's first Polynesian princess, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), happily distanced herself from any Lilo and Stitch comparisons. She was a strong character with an innocent charm underneath it all. She was also not your typical princess. She didn't wear a crown, elegant dress or anything you'd expect from a Disney princess. Moana was tough as nails through her journey of self-discovery. Auli'i Cravalho captured this role with her dynamic voice and her ability to naturally deliver lines in times of happiness and despair. Plus, it helped that she had the direction of legendary animation directors Ron Clements and John Musker.Johnson's transition to voice acting felt challenging in Moana, since his Hawaiian accent isn't strong compared to the rest of the cast. However, his charisma and humorous mannerisms were expressed well through Maui, demigod, shapeshifter, yadda, yadda. You can practically envision Johnson's acting behind the microphone in the studio. Maui is a fish-hook-wielding warrior who has a clear-cut mission of his own: Get off this darn island of his!The overall story of Moana is simple, yet ambitious: Mother Island, where Moana, her family and people live, is beginning to undergo hard times. Trees are drying and not producing fruit, schools of fish are vanishing near the island  it's beginning to become unlivable. Talk about a tall first order for the young princess-to- be Moana: Find a way to save your people!The film takes you on this journey by first showing you a glance into Moana's past, allowing you to understand her adventurous persona. She wants to travel beyond the reef, but her father, Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison), tells her numerous times, ""Nothing good is beyond the reef!""Eventually, Moana listens to her grandmother, Gramma Tala (Rachel House), who motivates her to find Maui, who is the only one that can put Mother Island's heart back into place to allow Moana's home to thrive once more.It's a fun tale that allows the beauty of Hawaii to spill onto your lap. There's never a dull moment. A fun fact I learned after the film is Moana means ""the ocean,"" which gives reason to the ocean  yes, the ocean  aiding Moana in her and Maui's journey.When the film reaches its climax, it felt as if it didn't matter whether the final fight to preserve Mother Island and its heart would be successful or not. The story had been a success in itself. Maui and Moana's journey together was heartfelt they learned how to show compassion for one another, and the story fared well on its own.The film's beauty lied in not only the music, but its telling of a story full of life lessons, as plenty of Disney films have done in the past. Moana takes its viewers on a pleasant vacation to a beautiful island where an abundance of love, smiles and relatable characters await.P.S. Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) makes an amazing cameo in this film."
224,Moana,,21 November 2016,"Spectacular animation, beautiful and fun characters, wonderful story","I could feel the warm breeze blowing through my hair, the fresh air and the smell of the ocean. The animation is incredible. The characters are fun, energetic, believable and just make you feel happy. Moana's adventure with the help of the dem-god Maui is inspirational humorous and genius.The cast is magnificent. A young girl named Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) is trying to find out who she is and what her purpose in life should be. Moana is my kind and courageous new princess who longs to do things no one has done before and try the unexpected. I adore her because she is so fun-loving and adventurous. Plus, she reminds me of myself and how I am adventurous and a friend to all. She is a great role model for girls because she learns to do many things she thought she never could. Even when she is scared, she mustards up the courage and conviction she needs. Auli'i Cravalho has the perfect voice for this part which involves many new songs that I loved. The demi-god Maui (Dwayne Johnson) is a perfect choice. He does everything he can to show how awesome and cool he is with his fabulous hook strength, gorgeous hair and good looks. I think he is lovable but he needs a push, or two or three, to do the right thing. Who knew Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) could sing? He can and I enjoyed his songs.The evil crab, Tamatoa (Jemaine Clement) is silly sly and very boastful. Stay after the end credits and you will see the funniest clip ever. You might recognize Jemaine Clement's voice from the movie BFG as one of the giants. He is one of our very odd shinny villains who sings. Gramma Tala (Rachel House) is one of the best Grandmas you will ever meet. She can tell that Moana has a connection to the ocean and she tries to help her fulfill her destiny while avoiding her son, Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison). Moana's father who wants her to stay home to be a princess and take care of the people who are part of their tribe. He learns that he has to let go, listen to his daughter and let her leave the nest and follow her heart and dreams so she can be free doing what she loves. The animation is spectacular with each and in every detail, an animator's passion shows. It makes you feel like you are seeing the ocean and the islands because the vivid and crystal clear rendition. The water at night and the islands are terrific and breathe taking. This stupendous film made me want to go island hopping with Moana and Maui.My favorite scene is when Moana and Maui are on the boat talking and Maui tells Moana a secret about his life. I won't give any spoilers, but this is a scene to watch for. I love it because it is so heart- felt and it just made me want to hug someone, tell them a secret and cry. You can really tell that Moana and Maui have a connection and care for each other deeply. I recommend this for kids age 6 to 18 and adults will enjoy it too. Kids will love the animation and fun-filled characters. There is a crazy chicken that will keep them laughing. The villains are not too scary. They will enjoy the comedy and quick one liners throughout the film. Adults will love the messages, the animation and the story. I give this film 5 out of 5 oceanic waves and stars."
225,Moana,7,30 November 2016,I actually enjoyed this,"I only ever watch Disney movies because my daughter wants to see them. This one is the first one that never once made me cringe! A good story with an admirable protagonist and some really good songs. Moana's relationship with her grandmother was well-done and touching. I hope that future Disney musicals will be this good, because my daughter's only five so I guess I have a few more years of watching them. Until Moana, Frozen was the only Disney movie that had ever moved me to tears. Now the list is up to two!It's hard to think of anything else to say that wouldn't be a spoiler. I found myself wondering how much the story is grounded in actual Polynesian culture, traditions, religion, and how much they just made up from scratch."
226,Moana,10,30 November 2016,The real Disney returns...,"It's been several years but Disney seems to have found its groove again when it comes to animated films. ""Moana"" is by far the best they've made in years. The soundtrack is catchy but NOT annoying like some of their other more recent films (Frozen...can't stand ""Let it Go""). In fact I rushed home to purchase a few of the songs from this picture, and for the record I'm a 33-year old male. The story doesn't take itself too seriously, but knows exactly when to stop being silly and deliver a dose of reality. Very minimal cast helped the decently paced 2 hour adventure focus on character development and report. Not that ensembles are bad, but this technique really gave Auli'i Cravalho (Moana) a chance to stand on her own and shine. And shine she did. Great film children and parents a like will enjoy. I cannot recommended it highly enough."
227,Moana,9,30 November 2016,Moana: Proof of the 2nd Disney Renaissance,"Disney has been on quite a roll lately with it's films. Over the past few years we have seen instant classics like Frozen and Wreck- it Ralph get released to instant acclaim and this year they delivered two films which are already among their best work, Zootopia and Moana. But while Zootopia was was notable for taking on major themes like racism, Moana is instead more interested with changing or removing elements that are usually found within Disney movies.Moana is the name of the film's protagonist, the daughter of the island chief who longs to explore the ocean against her father's wishes. She discovers that the Ocean has chosen her to sail across the sea to free the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and return a stone known as the heart of Te Fiti to its home. Maui had removed the stone centuries earlier and unknowingly cursed the world to an ever- growing darkness which is starting to consume Moana's home.The film is one of Disney's most beautiful with the images of the sea and sky looking absolutely astonishing. The film also managed to seamlessly blend 3D animation with traditional hand drawn animation to achieve the effect of Maui's magical/moving tattoos, a feat that has to be seen to believe. The soundtrack is one of the best ones that Disney has made since probably Mulan with the songs ""How Far I'll Go"" and ""You're Welcome"" being particularly fun and entertaining. (I'd like to point out that while ""Let It Go"" is a great song, I found the rest of Frozen's songs to be pretty lame.)Despite all of this, I think Moana's greatest strength lies in the way it subverts typical Disney conventions by discarding the use of a love interest and a main villain. While Moana technically isn't the first Disney princess without a love interest (that honor belongs to Brave's Merida), she is the first one I can think of where her lack of one isn't treated like a big deal. Remember that a key plot point of Brave was the fact that Merida's parents wanted to force her to get married against her wishes. Here though, it's never brought up as a concern. Moana never has to justify her singleness to her parents and her relationship with Maui remains platonic throughout the adventure. There is just too much on the line for her to worry about falling in love and the directors wisely choose to not force a romance into the plot (unlike the makers of Mulan who forced one in to that films detriment).The other notable change made with this film is its lack of a true antagonist. While there are villainous characters in the movie, they mostly serve as obstacles in Moana and Maui's path to return the heart of Te Fiti back to its home. At first the lack of a primary antagonist is a little jarring especially since they tend to be some of Disney's most memorable characters but here I think it was a wise choice to not include one. The stakes are already high enough without adding another layer of needless complexity. Amazingly, the lack of a true antagonist is another point of comparison with Brave which also did not feature a true villain in the classical sense. The big difference between the two of them there though is that Moana tells a simpler and more compelling story that benefits from not having a villain whereas Brave is an uneven mess that falls apart in the second act and might have improved a bit if it at least had a memorable villain.In the end Moana is a welcome addition to the Disney canon. The story is well written, it has beautiful animation, catchy songs, strong performances, and changes up a significant amount of Disney clichés to make it feel fresh and unique. I think we can definitely say at this point that Disney is experiencing a second renaissance."
228,Moana,10,30 November 2016,Breathtaking.,"Disney's string of heroic female leads just keeps going. And despite that unfortunate misstep with the Maui Halloween suit, work of the same sort of people who trashed ""Up"" because they didn't see it leading to any marketable toys, everyone seems to like the movie. Certainly it seems to treat Polynesian traditions with deep respect. Moana is a chief's daughter in a paradise that lives by one rule, ""Don't go beyond the reef."" But her sly and subversive grandmother tells her the story of how the demigod Maui stole the heart of an island, and unleashed a great danger, and someday someone was going to have to confront Maui and return the stolen heart. She finally reveals the secret of how their ancestors came to the island. When the crops are blighted and the fish disappear, Grandmother tells Moana with her dying words to go. She finally meets Maui (Dwayne Johnson), a cynical anti-hero who has been stranded for centuries on an island because his magic fishhook has been taken, stripping him of his powers. They recover the fishhook, confront the evil that Maui unleashed, and Moana returns to an island prepared to resume voyaging again. The scenes of canoe fleets racing across the waves are exhilarating, thrilling, visually stunning, emotionally moving, and left me with a taro-size lump in my throat. The confrontation with the lava monster and its final redemption are everything you want a fairy-tale ending to be. Moana is fabulous, and Dwayne Johnson (who is of Polynesian descent) just keeps getting better. Lawrence Olivier he may never be, but he's worth the price of a ticket."
229,Moana,10,28 November 2016,"Without doubt, Moana is culturally dedicated, well thought out and beautiful.","This engaging masterpiece is a huge success! In part because of it's empowering story line, which utilized a think-tank of Polynesian cultural elders and thinkers, and its feel-good music, T'ooyaksiy Niin (Thank you in Nisga'a) to Lin-Manuel Miranda for the score!Considering this is 16-year-old Auli'i (Moana) Cravalho's first acting performance it's almost unbelievable how well she contrasts and connects with Dwayne (Māui) Johnson. Both of their personalities blend together for many natural feel good moments.. and some other.. more dark moments.All in all I cannot promote this enough. We need movies like Moana. Movies that shine our indigenous peoples as positive adventurers and shepherds of the land & water. Gone should be the days of casting them in ""Savage"" roles. Moana is a perfect example of how culture can be promoted in a positive way.. I cannot believe I'm saying this.. WELL DONE Disney."
230,Moana,3,10 July 2017,"Terrible, culturally insensitive. A wash of a film.","I wanted to love this movie, as so many of my adult female friends adored it. Having studied Tahitian dance and hula, I found the movie to be incredibly demeaning to the island people, and musically boring. So sad, to take such a rich tradition and water it down to this level. This is Disney's cultural appropriation at its worst."
231,Moana,10,23 May 2017,"Excellent, but not completely understandable or enjoyable at first watch","This is a wonderful movie! If compared to other CGI female movies done by Disney, then it is not as light as Frozen (which had no villain songs, had a cheerful sidekick, and no definite deaths), but not as dark as Tangled (which had a skeleton, stabbing, blood stain, tying up, chaining, and plans for hanging), but it still has an enormous lava monster. Its hands are cut off multiple times and reappear. It may be frightening for children, but for others, thrilling. Here's what I liked and disliked:Liked: The brave, bold heroine Moana. She may have pushed the boarders even more than Tiana and Merida did. She's not working to build a business or shooting arrows, but she climbs and jumps everywhere, as well as teaches herself to sail and fights a ton of angry creatures. She has a beautiful singing voice and is probably the first Disney Princess to be voiced by a girl of her own age. (Paige O'Hara was 32 when voicing Belle.) She's disobedient to her father, like Mulan, Ariel, and Jasmine, but she does it for a good reason, like Mulan, not to get what she wants. The songs. One was a bit strange at first, but it grew on me. Dwayne Johnson isn't excellent at singing, but the music to the song he sings, ""You're Welcome,"" takes care of it and can get you pumped up. Again, I love Moana's singing. The twists. The ending is very, very obvious, but I was surprised with how it happened. There was one plan and one way it was going to happen all throughout the movie, but two minutes before the climax, it changed. Also, a friend betrays the other.The Easter eggs. They're fun in any movie! Maui's magical fishhook can make him transform into any animal, and he becomes Sven the reindeer from Frozen for a split second. Flowers are blooming, and one is the flower from Tangled. Fish are shown swimming in ""You're Welcome,"" and one is Flounder from The Little Mermaid.The short theatrical film. It's called ""Inner Workings,"" and shows a man's inner body parts communicating to each other. The heart has a personality of what the man wants, the brain is logical. They were connected to each other, but the brain disconnected them so the man could get done what he needs to be done and live a ""prosperous"" life. It sounds cheesy and lame, but it's good and for all ages when you watch it.The humor. There's some that is rude or doing with the bathroom, but the rest can make me crack up every time.The bit of excitement. Nothing was violent, but seeing a hand cut off or a lava monster screaming (it sounded something like scraping; not a scream or roar that will have your kids screaming back) takes things up another notch. Not as far as Tangled (not that Tangled was violent; it's just one of the MOST violent cartoon/CGI Disney movies), but farther than Frozen.Didn't like:The certain group of creatures that Moana fights against. It is just a bit strange and has me staring at the screen, going, ""Okaaay...?""The rude humor. ""Butt"" and ""pee"" aren't bad words, but they're still rude and not the best way to joke around. Two of the demigod Maui's transformations. Like the creatures Moana fights against, it's supposedly for children and just strange for adults. That Inner Workings was silent. I said I liked it, but I kept on waiting for someone to say something.How something wasn't completely clear. Maui said that after ""one last hit,"" his fishhook would be broken. I mistook that for one more time he used it or cut off the lava monster's arms, but it meant that one last hit or blow on the fishhook, not that the fishhook would make, would break it.The movie is exciting, surprising, and fun! Enjoy it with your family, but just think about what appeals to what age before you do so."
232,Moana,9,2 March 2017,Amazing Must-See,"Moana is an intriguing and sensational Disney movie that is a must-see by everyone. It is visually appealing with breathtaking animation and is full of catchy songs that everyone will find themselves humming after seeing the movie. From the young to the old, the deep yet simple plot of Moana will appease to everyone. It is a great family movie but can also be seen and loved by even those who dislike Disney movies. Moana tells the story of an adventurous, free spirited teen that has always dreamed of sailing the ocean because of her special magic connection to it. Despite her father's pleading and risk of danger, Moana sails to find Maui, an all-powerful demigod, to embark on a captivating adventure. The movie includes popular stars such as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson playing Maui, and Lin-Manuel Miranda writing the well-known songs from the movie. The plot of Moana is quite different than other Disney princess movies, and some may see that as a weakness, especially the lack of love interest in the movie. But this contrast to other Disney movies is what makes it so remarkable. Moana breaks the stereotype of Disney princesses which shows that they have to have perfect barbie bodies and need to depend on a man to come save them. It shows Moana as an independent young girl who only cares about pursuing her life dreams and not about what other people think of her. This a great role model for young girls to look up to and is one of the many things that makes Moana such a phenomenal movie."
233,Moana,10,1 March 2017,Most beautifully animated and truly amazing story..,"Most beautifully animated, truly amazing story, even better music, makes me think back to my visit to Disney World and brings out the kid inside me. It's honest and truly the best movie I have seen in the last five months.This movie is not just a movie, it's actually a work of art, the soundtracks, the vocals, the animation, the story, everything just works in this film."
234,Moana,7,23 February 2017,Moana is a family friendly must watch,"The movie Moana starts off like many other Disney movies: thus setting the stage for the rest of the movie. Moana starts off as little girl and you soon see that she, like many other princesses, is aspiring to be something her family and society doesn't want her to be. This is a very similar idea to the movie Mulan in which she joins the Chinese army even though it was man's job and proceeded to win the support of her people and everyone was happy. So when the movie Moana started in a similar fashion I was hesitant that it would be a stale Mulan-ish re run. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Moana is a fun, cute, feel good movie that was enhanced by the plot, voice actors, and fluid script that I would recommend for all ages. For starters Moana's unpredictable plot is intriguing due to the unknown element of the ocean exploration. The movie incorporates the unpredictability of the ocean by making Moana curious about it from the time she was born thus conveying the unpredictable plot while at sea. These multiple unexpected setbacks that occur on the ocean enhance the plot and makes it less cookie cutter. However, one down side is since this is a Disney movie there has to be a happy ending because it's Disney and they aren't going to make a children's princess movie have a sad ending. Another factor that made Moana an exciting movie was the voice actors for the characters. Especially Dwayne Johnson because his voice and tone fit the character Maui perfectly. Maui is a very large, muscular, stocky man and Dwayne Johnson is a large man in real life too so it was natural for him to play the role. The confident and deep tone he read Maui's lines with was very accurate to the stereotypical big macho man, but he also made his voice soft enough that it wasn't frightening to young children who make up the majority of the audience for Moana. Auli'I Cravalho also did a very good and appropriate vocal acting job for the audience as well. She used a very energetic and inspiring tone when Moana was trying to convince Maui to come with her on the adventure. As well as used a sterner tone when things started to get out of control. However, my favorite voice actor was Rachel House who played the old grandma Tala. Her tone was spot on with an old knowledgeable grandma. This was displayed by her compassionate and shaky voice which typically signifies wisdom. Overall the voice actors preformed their roles well and added to the movie's positives. Lastly Moana had a script that just flowed with the movie and didn't seem too cheesy. The dialogue was also not too complicated or hard to follow either since it was intended for a younger audience. For example, Moana's dialogue with Maui was childish and filled with simplified words that displayed frustration instead of using super complex words to get the same emotions involved. By doing this it actually made it more enjoyable for an older viewer as well because it was very easy to understand and was sort of a childish throwback tying it all together. All in all, I would recommend Moana for anyone under the age of 10 or wanting to relive a little portion of childhood. Between the heartwarming warming plot, emotionally touching voice actors and childish script Moana was a solid Disney film. I would rate it 7/10 stars and would say it is worth the watch for all ages."
235,Moana,7,20 February 2017,"Partly great, partly meh","Moana is a movie with breathtaking music and catchy songs, fun characters and great visuals, but it lacks a good plot. The movie isn't bad, and it has many great moments, but overall it's quite forgettable and uninspired when it comes to the story itself. I'd say Moana is worth watching, but I have no urge to see it again anytime soon. Instead I'll be replaying the soundtrack, especially one of the catchiest songs ever, Shiny."
236,Moana,9,19 February 2017,"Musical, fun, cute yet adventurous, Another Disney marvel.","Yet another Disney marvel. Loved the movie and how it travels around the life of a little girl. Great story line. Amazing 3-d animation. Each and every emotion of the film can be felt. The movie truly touches the heart and appeals that always listen to your heart no matter what people say. The animation does full justice to the story line and even more enhanced it and took it to another level. If you looking for relaxing, loving, emotional, calm yet adventurous movie to watch this is surely the one. The movie gives you lesson in the most beautiful way of how to live your life happily. A must watch for all."
237,Moana,,16 February 2017,she was a little child her father has forbidden her of going in the ocean but she knows that the ocean and,"Movie Review by Nafanua M. Fitisemanu Moana Rated: PG 4.5 stars""Moana"" is an encouraging movie especially for young viewers. The film is a mixture of all polynesian cultures, filled with a variety of songs in multiples languages and ancient legends of demons and demigods. Moana portrays the character of a strong, independent princess who goes through the journey to save her village and to find her true self. Although she is an independent princess there's always her family and friends right by her side to help on her adventure. She also discovers some of her ancestor's history to figure out who she really is. During this movie, Moana is faced with the trial of going against her father's word of going ""beyond the reef"" and to follow her heart. Ever since she was a little child her father has forbidden her of going in the ocean but she knows that the ocean and sea is her home. Later in the movie she comes across more obstacles but overcomes them with the support of her companion Maui. Although this film may have unrealistic or fictional scenes, all viewers can relate to Moana and how she overcomes all of her conflicts. Not only can the viewers relate, they can also learn that some things take a lot of work but you can always push through it with the help of others and with having courage to face your fears. Disney had done an astounding job of portraying the polynesian culture with traditions and music, while still having it simple so that children could still understand and follow along with the plot of the story. I highly recommend you to go and watch this movie, especially with your kids!"
238,Moana,7,24 November 2016,Enjoyable Cartoon Covering Hawaiian Culture and Youth,"7.1 of 10. Not up to the high standards that Sausage Party set for cartoons this year, but it definitely fulfills Disney's standard for creating inspirational stories for youth that intertwine with mythology and culture.It's also better than Kubo and the Two Strings, which it's more likely to be compared to given the importance of water in the story. The water animation itself is also better in Moana, from the transparency to the movement of the creatures in it.This should be a very enjoyable cartoon for girls and young women. Certainly above the crop of 2015 cartoons."
239,Moana,7,28 December 2016,7.5/10,"Moana Waialiki is a sea voyaging enthusiast and the only daughter of a chief in a long line of navigators. When her island's fisherman can't catch any fish and the crops fail, she learns that the demigod Maui caused the blight by stealing the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. The only way to heal the island is to persuade Maui to return Te Fiti's heart, so Moana sets off on an epic journey across the Pacific. The film is based on stories from Polynesian mythology.Given the recent streak of incredible films by Disney Animation, it is becoming ordinary for me to be really excited for one of their pictures. ""Moana"" does not tamper my enthusiasm, it is the most visually beautiful animated picture I have seen and one that has to spare some interesting stories to the audience, even though its plot and its musical numbers may occasionally stagger.What hit me really deep about the film was the cultural representation of these people. Other than offering many cue points for reflection on civilization, the way in which this culture is brought to life is really touching. Everything you'd want is given the life brilliantly, from the presentation of everyday life, traditions and society roles, to the relation of the people with their land and nature, which is probably the most resonant aspect of the film, right down to the changes that affect the population. This film really touched me on a cultural level it brought to life a place and people that aren't really given any space in the cinematic medium and it was a joy to be able to experience it and moreover experience it with this level of craft behind it, which always made it forward the story.That is the background on which our characters emerge and once again Disney graces us with colorful, rich and classic characters that really manage to stick out. Moana is a fresh character, her basic dynamic is really interesting and makes for very good and genuine drama in the first act. Moreover, there is a magnificent sequence in which she grows up on her desire for exploration is explained and shown to the audience perfectly. The supporting cast of characters is just as rich and motivated as her, Maui stands out as the classic reversal of the stereotype that Disney does for comedic value and once again it works. Moana's grandmother too is a hippy-like version of this culture and it hits good emotional beats both comedically and dramatically. Moreover, the film is quite funny and that has to be given to the great touches of slapstick comedy given to the chicken and the witty touches added by Maui.Yet, what is possibly the most stunning aspect of the film resides only in its animation. The land and the nature of the places we visit are brought to life in ways I could not have ever imagined. The images are intelligent, rich and colorful, they manage to never get repetitive or banal, they are just this canvas of beauty and you can't help but be overwhelmed by it, especially because to the absolutely gorgeous visuals sound is combined in extremely smart ways and used in order to give the audience a heightened experience and feel the place rather than just look at it, really bringing forth a sensorial experience rather than just a viewing one.However, ""Moana"" does not rank among the very best Disney has offered us recently as it presents some flaws that make it a little choppy. Firstly, the musical numbers can occasionally feel meandering, as I said above there are different songs that are beautiful and bring forth the story and the characters, yet there are as many songs where characters just erupt into singing and it only feels like they are screaming ""I am in a Disney film and I'm going to siiiiing as I embark on my journey!"". The plot also has a few issues in the fact that it gets incredibly convoluted in a chain of events that really don't need to be there, it is hard to tell where we're at at times and moreover it gives the film some pacing issues towards the end.In the end ""Moana"" serves as a great addition to the Disney canon of their recent years, it is definitely remarkable and certainly not forgettable, whilst it might not be their usual quality, it is still a great ride to have at the cinema."
240,Moana,10,15 December 2016,Awesome Funny Movie,"This movie really makes me laugh. I really like hey-hey the chicken that survives the adventure haha. I'm sure I already read a story like this where they take the plot. I just can't remember what was that story. The singing is awesome, I really enjoy Dwayne sing hehe. I love nature and this movie is all about that, it's simply amazing. Animation, comedy, action and drama, it's a complete package, recommended for all ages. Also about his movie is the love and care for your family and others. There's also a lot of moral lesson. Never give up on those trials and obstacles in life, it will make you stronger. Always remember who you are."
241,Moana,10,9 December 2016,One of the best Disney animated movies in years!,"Wow,this movie did not disappoint!I didn't think Disney could top Zootopia this year, but I think they just might have.So, it starts on somewhat familiar territory. I've heard a few critics say that it starts like a lot of the Disney fairytale movies - A girl who wants more in her life, and her parents who are far too protective. So what?! I don't care. As long as they can keep retelling this formula in new and creative ways, I have no problem with it. And we've never seen it told in this setting before.The animation is spectacular. I would go as far to say that Moana is the best looking movie of 2016.The characters are really good. Moana is a strong and very likable lead and Maui is at least as likable as the genie from Aladdin. Dwayne Johnson was the perfect choice for Maui. In fact, he literally is an animated Dwayne Johnson!Alan Tudyck, the John Ratzenburger of the present day Disney movies, plays Hei Hei, a comic relief that is used just enough, and never gets annoying, or distracts from the movie's central plot.I also congratulate Disney for not relying on star power, with Dwayne Johnson as an exception. Whereas Frozen, and even Zootopia to a certain degree had a lot of famous names, most of the cast aren't particularly very well known. This is Auli'i Cravalho's first ever movie, and she managed to play the part perfectly.I can't recommend this movie enough. I absolutely loved both Zootopia and Kubo and the two Strings, and didn't think there'd be a better animated movie this year, but I was wrong!"
242,Moana,8,9 December 2016,Not Just a Movie - A new Voyage for Disney fans!,"Cross posted from my blog: http://blog.nrajesh.com/moana-2016/ Just as I am writing this, BBC News confirms that some parts of Hawaii are under three feet of snow. A study by NASA just confirms that ""it is no longer a question whether the West Antarctic Ice sheet will melt, it is a question of when""! In case you wonder what all this has to do with a Disney princess movie, read on The story of Moana, while appearing as a brand new take of the Princess movie genre, is just an outfit for the 'naked ugly truth' that we all have come to digest. The story depicted is that of a voyage seeking adventurous girl, who needs to fight not just against the society (including her father), but also her own fears to go on an epic journey, to do something that everyone thinks is a fool's errand.Moana is not an ordinary girl though-she is the chosen one who can end the blight caused by the demigod Maui a millennia ago. A little back story is that Maui has stolen the heart of the goddess Te Fiti, and very soon he is felled by Te ka (an ash spewing lava monster). He also looses his ""hook"", which gives him shape-shifting powers.The makers of the film have stuck to the usual sing and dance, rebellious princess with a comic little pet (a colourful chicken named Heihei). But what they portray even in the back story is very hard to ignore.What Maui represents is nothing more than the various species that rely on mother nature for survival. The ""human"" who also happens to discover uses for things like fire or even simple products of nature (like a coconut), wanted to steal the core of mother nature (Te Fiti) for betterment of the lives of his brethren.In the end, even Maui exclaims that even though he stole and sought a piece of nature for fellow humans to claim their fond feelings, he always felt defeated because they always remained unsatisfied.The back story ends when the peaceful part of Te Fiti disappears. Ta Ka emerges. It is nothing more than one of the violent faces of mother nature.The story line apart, I found the visuals of this movie were an absolute treat. A special shout-out to the scenes where Moana and Maui interact with a giant crab named Tamatoa! The chase by the coconut-pirates was really creative. Even the mature audience are left teary eyes by the songs and dialogues (in general).All it took to plant the seed of undertaking this journey in Moana's mind, was the undying persuasion of her grandma (the crazy old woman of the village). Not surprisingly, the depletion of the food source simply put it in action. What saves it, at most times, is teamwork; and there is proof that even if your teammate is someone as helpless as a confused chicken, it will suffice. What finally does fulfil this epic quest is that singular attribute we humans manage to find even in our most trying times  a ray of hope! Moana is important NOT just because Disney redefined the very purpose of a princess story  from being just two hour fairy tales to tales conveying subtle messages for today's younger generation. If the kids don't seem to get it, please pitch in as a parent or a tutor.This movie IS significant because it manages to stir a belief in us that we seem to have long forgotten. It reminds that true redemption is to do that thing which our soul ""truly"" seeks. It clarifies that we are all voyagers at heart and all we have to do is just set sail beyond the comfort zones of our conflicted minds. Do that and you can overcome even your most feared adversary. Do watch in theatres to give your little princes and princesses a great holiday treat!"
243,Moana,9,4 December 2016,Magical and Beautiful Film,"I found Moana to be absolutely mesmerizing. I said before that I went in expecting it to be just pretty good, but within the first ten minutes of watching this movie, I could tell that I was going to be wrong. The best word to describe this film is magical. The animation itself is beautiful. The colors are rich and vibrant, and you see a lot of new environments that we haven't seen in animated movies before. There are some shots in this film that took my breath away, which doesn't usually happen in an animated movie for me. It was just beautiful. And the music by Lin-Manuel Miranda is brilliant! I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but the music in Moana worked just so damn well. It's catchy, and it really suites the film. It organically works into the movie, and they even occasionally make a couple jokes about the fact that they're singing throughout."
244,Moana,9,7 December 2016,Moana,"Moana is Disney's latest animated film and it comes from the same creative team behind Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Hercules, The Princess and the Frog and Treasure Planet. Moana feels like a worthy successor to Disney's most beloved animated classics while in the meantime pushing the genre into 2016, introducing a smart, diverse and convincing heroine. Plus, I don't know why but it reminds me of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker for the most part. The weight and core of the film is based on both of the main character shoulders and their chemistry. Dwayne - The Rock - Johnson charisma comes through, even just in the voice. At this point, he has proved that he is a real superstar and that he is here to stay. I love his depiction of Maui, he is sort of a sarcastic prick but still lovable because - let's be honest - it is The Rock we are talking about. Auli'i Cravalho is splendid, showing off her pipes with ""How Far I'll Go"", delivering the kind of classic Disney ""I want"" song that brings to mind The Little Mermaid's ""Part of Your World"" and Hercules' ""Go the Distance"". The music is, in my opinion, the best of their most recent films. Especially one which is destined to be the next ""Let It Go"", parents out there, be prepared, it is coming. Moreover, Moana offers us all a wave of girl power that we can ride and we love that. First, Moana will be chief after her father and nobody questions it. Second, she doesn't have a love interest, because she has an island to save. Third, her grandmother and mother are both strong presences in her life; in a perfect Bechdel Test fashion, they don't talk about men. Finally, she can do it all and keeps on fighting for what she believes in. As per usual with Disney animated films, the animation is out of this world stellar, with each passing year Disney is getting better and better at the animated photorealistic background, here especially the Ocean. Overall, Moana is a very fun and entertaining film with everything you'd want in a Disney film: great animations, good songs, good voice work, good moral core, good message and most importantly heart."
245,Moana,8,6 December 2016,Beautiful animation and an all-around fun time brought to us by Disney.,"""Moana"" was as fun and light-hearted as I could have wanted. A truly entertaining piece brought to us by Disney but who could have honestly expected anything different? Before getting into anything else, I have to first bring focus to how beautiful this movie is. The animation is so perfect and wonderfully done that I had moments where I forgot I was watching an animated film. From the models themselves, to the water effects, to the simplest motions. This was a truly beautiful movie to witness... ""Moana"" also was very fluid and entertaining from start to finish. I never sat bored or felt rushed, it was a smooth and easy film to follow. Entertaining for the youngest of watchers to the most seasoned movie goer... Lastly, what is a Disney follow up movie to ""Frozen"" without a little music? The singing pieces within this film was also a bunch of fun to experience. Although I can see other viewers getting annoyed or tired of the music but you come to expect that going into a Disney movie like ""Moana"". I personally enjoyed Dwayne's song ""You're Welcome"" but of course, I am a bit biased when it comes to anything Dwayne.There is not much else I can say beyond what is already said. It is another animated Disney movie, but a brilliantly done one at that. ""Moana"" is a film for all to love and is well deserving of all the kinds of praise it has been getting in recent weeks. Keep an eye out for this one in the future as well for the coming Oscars season."
246,Moana,8,5 December 2016,"Moana: Disney plays the same note, the good one","Firstly Moana will be incredibly popular. It's a tried and tested format of young prince/ princess finding themselves in the real world, as well as the characters, trials and tribulations that come with that (Tangled anyone?). The premise is simple, Moana, a young soon to be tribal leader of her people, feels the sea drawing her into an adventure which will ultimately save her people.Based in the beautiful south pacific, the production does it justice with awe inspiring scenery and settings. The script follows a very Disney fan familiar route however it has proved timeless, inspiring and feel good for parents and children.Like Frozen the main character Moana is joined by an unusual sidekick, as a snowman would like melt in the climate, a simple chicken substitutes. For adults, the bizarreness of it all made for some humour, however by the end I was wondering if it was morally questionable to be laughing at a mentally challenged sidekick, despite it being a chicken.Dwayne Johnson was made for his role, not just considering his heritage, but acting as young Moana's unwilling tutor Maui, his presence captivates and dominates the screen.Very much like Frozen, Moana provides a child friendly soundtrack. However to some viewers, including myself, the headline song ""How far I'll go"" was played throughout the film. I felt the song being crammed down my throat as ""Let it go Take 2"" and despite children enjoying the experience, the feeling of forcing it on the audience was obvious to the more experienced pallet. Also another scene (involving a huge octopus) had an extremely odd ""Robbie Williams"" type song, not in keeping with the genre and to be honest the whole scene just felt odd.The final third of the film is, as already stated, inspiring and heart warming, leaving that nice fuzzy feeling that the Disney greats seem to do.Your children will love this movie, and is a must-see for the festive season. A well made production, with a reasonable script, a tried and tested format and (for the most part) an enjoyable soundtrack, this movie is very good and deserving of 8*."
247,Moana,9,3 December 2016,Just came back from watching it. Very good,"Moana is the new Disney Princess movie directed by the people that brought you Aladdin and The Little Mermaid to name a few and tells the tale of a young teenager named Moana,who lives in Polynaisa with her family where a demi god named Mauli set a curse on the land over a thousand years ago and its up to Moana to team up with him to revoke the curse that is set upon the ocean. Overall the animation was gorgeous, the voice cast was good, personally i think Dwanye Johnson who voices Mauli stoled the film as he reminded me of the genie from Aladdin as he can shape shift into anything, the girl that voiced and sung as Moana was very good since it was her movie debut. There's no villain however in this film, and yes folks this is a musical. 4/5 stars"
248,Moana,10,3 December 2016,A New Real Hero,"I've seen this movie today and I really like this movie! Moana is a real hero, she is strong, smart, courageous and funny, something we haven't seen earlier in a female character from Disney. I could never look up to Snow White or Cinderella, when I was little, I would always rather watch the male heroes. Moana is a REAL women, like people call some men REAL men. She saves the world and is a real fighter. The movie is full of humor and is exciting. Moana and demigod Maui encounters one after another interesting enemy. All characters are beautifully developed and thought-out, not one character is annoying or boring. This movie has also a beautiful scene, with many colors and detail and the culture on the island is really nice to experience. Background music fits the scenes too. What I disliked were the musical-like songs, they feel like little breaks from the story, but that is the only negative thing I would point out. I would definitely recommend this movie in the cinema, 10 out of 10!"
249,Moana,7,3 December 2016,"A visually astonishing animation, albeit not the most enthralling","Continuing their Second Renaissance in style, Disney may have just hit upon their most visually beautiful film of all time with Moana. With crisp and vibrant animation everywhere you look, this film is a real feast for the eyes. It's also a very entertaining and funny family adventure, thanks to two great central performances, and although it may not have the brains or the emotional depth of some of Disney's best recent work, Moana is an absolute delight to watch from start to finish.Let's start, however, with the animation, which blew me away. Just as visually impressive as Pixar, Moana is a film that really embraces the beauty of nature, and shows it off on screen in a way you've probably never seen before. Whilst Finding Nemo and Dory were incredible feats in depicting the sea through animation, there's something about Moana's crisp and photo-realistic vision of a bright blue Polynesian ocean that's even more stunning to witness.This is easily one of the most colourful and vibrant films I've ever seen. Along with the eye-watering blue sea, the landscapes are also absolutely wonderful to look at, with the beautiful bright greens of the trees mixing with the browns and sandy whites of the ground, making every single image on screen utterly dazzling for the eyes.However, it's not only the stunning animation that makes Moana such a delightful watch. Huge credit has to go to the lead voice actors, Auli'i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson, who play Moana and Maui respectively. Although both characters are at first a little difficult to love, when they embark on their epic journey across the ocean together, they become an absolutely perfect duo.The characters themselves and their contrasting personalities play off one another so well, making for some great laughs and adding some fun into what can be a surprisingly small and solitary movie, focusing almost entirely on the two alone together at sea. However, the voice performances are what really make the two characters, as Cravalho gives Moana the perfect determination and strength to be a likable and exciting protagonist, whilst Dwayne Johnson's sheer charisma makes Maui a perfect counterpart, and the two make the pairing hugely entertaining from start to finish.Now, as a whole, Moana is wonderfully family-friendly, and definitely the most upbeat and funny of the Disney's recent releases. The leading duo are cute and cuddly, and their chemistry makes for loads of laughs, whilst the story's clear and direct objective makes a very easy-to-read watch for all ages.However, that does unfortunately come at an expense. Over the past few years, Disney's increasingly impressive repertoire has proved how intelligent, deep and rousing an animated kids' film can be. From Zootopia's fascinating social commentary to Wreck-It Ralph's beautiful emotion, I was expecting a similar degree of depth and brains from Moana, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed.Whilst the animation is at times enough to make your eyes water, the story here doesn't really provide an enthralling experience, as Moana and Maui's journey seems plagued by a rather formulaic level-by-level plan. It's entertaining without a doubt, but the way we follow the two moving from adversary to adversary, and never really delving as much into each of their emotional stories.That was a little disappointing for me, but not so much given the rest of the film's sheer beauty. If there is one major disappointment I have with Moana, then it's the soundtrack. Apart from the fact that I didn't even feel it was necessary, the musical numbers here feel very forced. There's nothing like the rousing anthems of Frozen's soundtrack, and although one song is uplifting, many of the numbers both come about and end in a very abrupt manner, consistently frustrating me as I was looking to be more exhilarated by the music.Overall, however, Moana is a very good film. Hugely entertaining from start to finish thanks to its two main leads and excellent comedy, and particularly delightful because of its utterly beautiful animation, I had a great time watching this wonderful family movie, and although its story is a little on the thin side and its music is somewhat underwhelming, I wholeheartedly recommend Moana."
250,Moana,8,2 December 2016,"""Moana"" Finding What She Is Meant to Be","Disney's ""Moana"" is visually spectacular and fun. The blue oceans, the lush tropical islands, and beautiful Polynesian people are vibrantly created in state of the art animation. The songs co-written by Lin- Manuel Miranda of Broadway ""Hamilton"" fame have a Hawaiian flavor and engaging lyrics. Dwayne Johnson voices Demigod Maui with the gusto of The Rock from his WWE days. He almost steals ""Moana"" with his comical zeal and authentic introspection. Newcomer Auli'i Cravalho is enchanting as Moana. She is a young star with a fabulous voice. I grew up in Hawaii and was familiar with some of the Hawaiian mythology. Demigod Maui was the way finder who pulled up the Hawaiian Islands from the ocean with his great fishing hook. ""Moana"" is enjoyable and superbly entertaining. Ironically, while the brave way finders discovered the vast unknown, ""Moana"" ventures into familiar seas. Jared Bush wrote the screenplay for ""Moana"" from the story by Ron Clements, John Musker, Chris Williams, Don Hall and 3 others. Perhaps too many writers. They wrote this kluged narrative and predictable story. This is unfortunate on several levels. ""Moana"" is an homage to Polynesian culture which is rarely depicted in even live-action movies. This is an empowerment tale about the rites of passage of the young girl Moana (Cravalho), heir apparent Chieftain. ""Moana"" echoes the sacred bond of man and the earth. The story albeit inspiring has been done before. Maui (Johnson) says ""High five."" and ""Got your back."" The colloquialisms seem out of place for an ancient tale that is a couple thousand years old. Directors Ron Clements and John Musker smooth out the journey joyously with visuals and song. In the story, Chief Tui (proud and strong Temuera Morrison)Moana's father, forbid anyone to sail beyond the Island's reef. To save the Island and her people, Moana sails beyond the reef into the great ocean to find Maui. Metaphorically, ""Moana"" might have done the same as its hero, throwing caution to the wind and risking the great unknown.""Moana"" opens as Gramma Tala (strong and gentle Rachel House) tells the story to children of how Maui stole the heart of Te Fiti (Island Goddess). The heart is a green stone that possesses the life force. Upon escaping Maui battles the lava monster Te Ka, and he along with his fishing hook and the heart of Te Fiti are vanquished into to the depths of the sea. In a recurrent Disney signature the story scares the children; all except little Moana. Then the ocean poetically anoints Moana as the chosen one for the heart of Te Fiti. Years pass and Moana's Island is dyingthe fishing and crops depleted. Gramma Tala reveals to Moana (Cravalho) she is the one who must return the heart of Te Fiti, and find Maui. To complete the quest she breaks her Father's law to sail beyond the reef. Wise Tala enlightens Moana that she will find what she is meant to be. Johnson and Cravalho charm as the unlikely partnersthe woman chieftain and the demigod in redemption. Cravalho voices Moana's strength amidst her self-doubt. She is an awesome singer. The song ""How Far I'll Go"" is moving. Johnson also can carry a tune as Maui. He brings a playful pompousness to the hulking kind of squishy tattooed Mauiso unlike his real chiseled persona. He also displays a compassionate vulnerability, especially when he tells how he became the demigod. He and Cravalho have wonderful chemistry, and give ""Moana"" its big heart. We pull for Maui and Moana on their treacherous journey. They are finding who they are meant to be. That really matters for us. Although familiar, ""Moana"" has brilliant song, amazing sights, and true soul. Enjoy."
251,Moana,10,29 November 2016,A masterpiece of legendary proportions.,"The first I heard of Moana was a brief appearance in Zootopia (2015). I was intrigued by the Maori/Polynesian setting and attracted to the fact that the plot was driven not by romance like most prior princess films, but rather by honor, family, and courage (and, to be honest, my own love of sailing). I was not disappointed. From the opening exposition, to the hilarious post-credit scene (see IMBB's trivia, quotes, and connections sections AFTER you watch this masterpiece) and from the use of Dead Reckoning (Reckon correctly, or you are (Sorry, aviation/maritime joke) and well-done musical numbers (Who knew The Rock could sing?!) to the near-flawless animation and references to other prominent films. Even the family- friendly swear-substitutes and subtle adult humor had the entire audience laughing.This film, along with Zootopia, Interstellar, Forrest Gump, iRobot, and Independence Day (the original one) among others, is one of my favorites, and one that is a must-see for all members of the family, regardless of age."
252,Moana,10,28 November 2016,Superb movie for both kids and adults,"You cannot ask for more in a Disney movie like this. Fun enough, smart enough, lesson learned enough, great graphic design, amazing music. I love it when Disney is out of their comfort zone of love stories between princess and prince charming. Their stories are more down to earth, meaningful and respect the value of young women in life and more Pixar. The short film, Inner workings, is so good for kids and adults to watch.You will not feel pity for any pennies you pay for this movie. I swear. Now Oscar for Zootopia or Moana? Tough question. But Congrats Disney, You had an terrific years with many hit movies!!!"
253,Moana,9,27 November 2016,"Moana is a Great Adventure, Magical at Times and at Worst a Little Over-The-Top","People want diversity in their animated movies, female main characters and some deviation from the formula. Disney has answered the call. It's commendable of them and I applaud them for it. We don't get to do much travelling to exotic locales like in some of the older Disney movies. In Moana, we get to travel to Polynesia and although some elements of the plot are familiar, the movie has a different flavour to it and I enjoyed it. Was the rest of the movie as fresh as the environment the movie was set in? The answer is both yes and no, I'm not trying to be secretive but just like any other movie, there are bright spots and things that aren't quite perfect.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We get a short introduction from Gramma Tala (Rachel House) on how the islands came to be. Te Fiti is a goddess who sprang from the ocean and began to create life. It wasn't long until other life forms wanted her power for themselves. A demigod named Maui (Dwayne Johnson) traveled to her island and stole her heart. When he tried to make his escape, he was confronted by Te Ka, a monster made of lava. The two battled to a standstill and the heart was lost. This left Te Ka in power and even 1000 years later, he still exacts revenge by draining fish from the oceans and swallowing up islands. It's a cool story but the problem is that she's telling it to a bunch of small children who begin to cry and run around frightened. All except one, little Moana (eventually being voiced by Auli'i Cravalho) who is already a little adventurer at heart. She's drawn towards the sea and despite the objections of her father Chief Tui (Temeura Morrison) ventures out to the beach to pick up shells and help a baby turtle make it across the beach. The waves begin to literally begin to play with her (it's an adorable scene) and part to reveal more shells for her to collect. Her father stops her but even as she grows, she always still feels the call of the ocean and tries to balance her responsibilities with her longing for adventure.There's so much to talk about with this movie, I already touched on how beautiful the atmosphere is. The animation is beautiful the whole way around. From the island life to how the water moves and interacts with the characters, to the character design (the coconut pirates were particularly awesome), it all looks great. You expect this from Disney (between their work and Pixar, they represent the gold standard) but it's worth noting all the same. It's definitely one of their better looking movies and although the rest of the movie is up to the task, I don't think it would have been the same without the efforts of the animators.The next thing to mention is how great the music was. I didn't love every song (""Shiny"" wasn't bad but it wasn't my thing) but when the movie really hit the right spot with the musical numbers, it took me back to the Disney movies I watched when I was a kid (The Lion King, Aladdin just to name a couple). There were some pretty powerful songs in here that were not only fun to listen to but were also very emotional. My favourite was ""You're Welcome"" which is when Moana is introduced to Maui and he thinks she's come to him as an adoring fan. Who knew that Dwayne Johnson could sing? I had a big grin on my face for the whole song. I think kids will love the music and adults will get something out of it too.The characters are new and well developed but they aren't without familiarity either. I think this is where some people will have problems with the movie. Moana is technically like some Disney princesses and her journey isn't without some familiar elements. This is something I didn't take a big issue with, sure it would be great if it was something that we hadn't seen before but I don't have a problem if you can follow the formula but put a new twist on it. Moana is a great role-model for the kids out there, balancing her duty with her enthusiasm for adventure and although Maui comes across initially as very self-involved, he's actually pretty vulnerable and there was a reason for doing what he did.I want to finish up with the voice acting, which was also pretty great throughout. This was an especially strong debut performance for Auli'i Cravalho. She not only was great in the musical bits but I felt like her performance had a lot of emotion in it. She had a character with a lot of conflict about what she was doing and through her performance, she made the audience care about what happened to Moana. Dwayne completely nailed it as Maui, it almost felt like him just showing off his newly found range. The guy honestly just keeps getting better as an actor. The supporting actors were also good, I didn't like his song but Jermaine Clement just has a voice that's perfect for animated movies, he does fine work. Rachel House and Temeura Morrison were noteworthy in their respective supporting roles.I didn't love everything about this movie but the aspects it got right, they were ultimately pretty great. Anything that makes me think of the older Disney movies I grew up with was doing something right and I was left reminiscing more than a few times. I didn't love the ending but it did end on a nice hopeful note and they over-played the chicken sidekick. I liked this better than Frozen but not as much as Inside Out. If you have kids, they're going to absolutely love this movie, I give it an 8.5/10"
254,Moana,8,27 November 2016,Moana: Disney Animation Studio's Highest Technical Achievement,"My main desire to see Moana was simply for the incredible animation promised in its trailers. Many will find that this is clearly where Moana shines. If you are simply looking for two hours of engrossing eye candy, then this is your movie. This particular CGI animated film looks immensely better than any previous Disney Animation Studio effort including this year's Zootopia and Pixar's Finding Dory. When viewing Moana, I would highly suggest getting a close seat because you will notice great detail in the animation (especially with character design) and have a better viewing experience overall up close and personal.Sadly, being a typical Disney Animated film, we as viewers already have an idea on what is going to happen by the end of this vigorous tale. Don't get me wrong the journey is worth the viewing but, this isn't the place for a Disney movie to suddenly shine with its plot. However, Moana does have neat folklore and a nice backstory to make up for its predictability. As the film progressed, I was excited to know more about the setting where Moana lives and her community's backstory.The original songs that are featured strengthen the film and coincide with the story in fantastic ways. I think the effort and time put in the making of these songs gives Moana more credibility as a well presented animated film. However, not every song amazed me for one song in the middle of the film did sway me and came off as a bit cheesy. Another tiny disappointment regarding music was Disney's attempt to popularize one of the main songs used in the film by getting a pop star to do a radio friendly rendition that appeared in the credits.Much of the comedy (including one sad joke referencing Twitter) threw me off a bit as I did not find myself laughing during this flick for I was too engrossed in what I was witnessing visually. Moana's chicken Heihei would go on to get the most laughs in the theater almost every time he appeared on screen. Kids and mostly the parents found this hilarious but for me the chicken and most of the jokes set up were not very entertaining. I would have preferred Moana's cute pig Pua to accompany her on this adventure instead of trying to obtain cheap laughs with this dumb and unfunny chicken. These few complaints however do not get in way for what is clearly Disney Animation Studio's highest technical achievement.I think as a sole adventure/musical/drama, Moana ""sails"" great on its own. If it wasn't for Zootopia's great message and overall creativity (and the hard relentless effort put into Kubo and the Two Strings), I would place my bet on Moana for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature."
255,Moana,9,27 November 2016,A great film. I like.,"Moana is, without a dought, one of the best films of 2016. Another film from legendary Disney directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Little Mermaid and Aladdin) and starring Dwane ""The Rock"" Johnson and newbie Auli'i Cravalho, Moana, Disney's newest princess movie, is a win. The Rock's Maui steals every scene he is in. His great performance enhances his comedy, especially in his musical number ""You're Welcome"". In addition, I didn't know Dwane could sing! But, the best thing about this film is the animation. Moana is so beautiful it rivals Good Dinosaur and Totoro. It's obvious they spent a long time on every single coconut. Yet, every good movie has it's downsides, and Moana is no different. The movie had a few too many inappropriate jokes not done well. A lot of the songs were pretty unmemorable, though I remember liking most of them. All in all: 9/10."
256,Moana,9,26 November 2016,Great movie for kids!,"Saw this with my wife, 3 year-old daughter & mother-in-law & we all loved it. The packed theater of mostly kids & parents seemed to love it & gave it a good round of applause at the end! It is what it is people...a Disney Princess movie with some good laughs, great songs & an overall good family time. For those who didn't like it, I'm not sure what you were expecting with an animated Disney Princess flick. My wife & I were singing the music the rest of the day. Moana had (for what its worth)likely the best song ever sung by The Rock, and he didn't sound half bad. Ms. Cravalho, as Moana, was excellent & has a beautiful voice...move over Elsa & Anna, make room for Moana! The animation was gorgeous, the writing was cute & amusing, the plot was entertaining enough, it's hard to find much to complain about. I'd give it a 10 except it wasn't scary enough for me as I love scares but hey, it was a Disney Princess movie for gosh sake! :)"
257,Moana,7,23 November 2016,A Satisfying Magical Resurrection of A Long Lost Culture,"Faithful to the tradition of Disney's renaissance era, Moana takes audiences of all ages on a journey with a resourceful young woman who learns her place in the world. Parents will love the tribute toward Polynesian culture, while kids will love the fantastical journey made complete with a fresh color palette. Other than an inappropriately placed gag about urination, Moana has established itself as yet another family-friendly hit by the Disney studio within their CGI renaissance.The wide range of animation styles explored here starts with a two- dimensional storytelling of what Polynesian religion believes brought the islands into existence. In what appears to be a moving tapestry, a wise, grandmotherly voice-over tells us of Mother Island, who raised islands out of the sea and then rested among them. That is, until Maui the shapeshifting demigod stole her heart. Along his path away from Mother Island, he lost the heart, as well as his fish hook that allows him to shapeshift.Then the animation style switches to the traditional computer animation, where an elderly storyteller is speaking to her grandchildren about the story. The one seated in the middle of the pack, the heroine of our story, immediately goes out onto the seashore, where the miraculously animated living water leads her through conch shells to the heart of Mother Island itself: the ocean called her to restore peace to the land.Then this toddler grows up to become Moana, daughter of the chief who wishes to sway away from their traditional ways in order to explore the world. She's a typical kid's movie heroine we've seen countless times before, and her motive to defy authority is not a good message for our kids, but the empowering musical voice by Auli'i Cravalho plenty makes up for that.Her grandmother pushes her to follow the calling by the ocean to find Maui the demigod so that she can help him retrieve his fish hook and return the heart to Mother Island. It follows out of the tradition followed by her people, as they are not voyagers; but their long-forgotten ancestry says otherwise. Therefore, Moana goes out on the quest, with a google-eyed, dim-witted chicken as her sole companion.Then she meets Maui himself, voiced with a lovable laid-back nature by Dwayne Johnson. He adds the familiar heart and soul expected from any Disney feature, as his tattoos move individually to express his true feelings.Now with the demigod on her voyage, Moana travels elsewhere to find his hook and get to Mother Island. Such stops include an underwater world of fantasy that houses a giant gold-crazy hermit crab. He is not one of the more tolerable portions of the adventure though, as his modes of dialogue includes rambling without a clear punchline to whatever joke he's attempting to deliver, and an out of place song sung in the style of Paul McCartney.This is among one of the other songs that simply sound odd in melody. Even so, there are several hits in the score, including Moana's single ballad, ""How Far I'll Go,"" and the catchy ""We Know the Way,"" both of which are guaranteed Oscar nominations. Yet none of these songs will catch on as one of Disney's iconic tunes. In addition, anytime the characters are not singing, they are blatantly telling us through not-so-subtle foreshadowing what will happen later on.Another thing that is difficult to grasp about Moana is the big ""so what"" of its celebration towards pagan religion. While yes, we should never be afraid to learn about other cultures and their backgrounds, depicting their gods as truth is not the answer to learning about who these people are. I would like for Disney to someday make a big leap in exploring and faithfully retelling the way those of another culture live their day to day lives, as to make up for their poor treatment of non-White races in the past.I cannot see Moana becoming a celebrated classic like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or The Little Mermaid, nor can I see it largely influencing pop culture like Frozen or Zootopia, but it is still a fresh adventure for the young and young at heart to get the ideal expected Disney experience."
258,Moana,8,23 May 2017,"Formulaic, but well-executed","The basic plot of ""Moana"" does not contain many surprises for anyone who has seen more than a few children's films. The film not only gives us a young hero, but refers to her as ""the Chosen One"", making it impossible to overlook the film's few deviations from the standard Joseph Campbell formula. That probably sounds like a fairly minor critique, but I feel the need to point it out anyway.Dwayne Johnson is a charismatic individual, so it's a shame that most of the roles he gets do not measure up to his talents. In this film, he plays an arrogant demigod whose physical presence and immaturity do not conceal his compassion and insecurity as well as he probably thinks they do. He's probably the best thing about this movie, getting one of its best songs and a whole lot of clever lines and gags. Our hero, Moana, is a young Polynesian girl who wonders if there might be something beyond the coral reef that her father, the village chief, forbids anyone to go beyond. Will she venture beyond it someday and embark on a grand adventure that will save her people and bring her face-to-face with beings and lands she had never imagined, possibly with the accompaniment of a cute animal sidekick? I'll ask again: Have you ever seen a Disney film?I mentioned that the songs in this film are good, and they're probably the best in any Disney film in recent memory. (This Lin-Manuel Miranda guy might be going places.) Actually, it might be the best Disney animated musical since the 90s. The animation is colorful and vivid, and the script wisely leaves out the love interest character that was obligatory in these movies for a while (although it calls attention to itself for not featuring a princess, which is unnecessary.) If you are a Disney person or need something to show the kids, you could do much, much worse. I just like The Rock."
259,Moana,8,11 April 2017,Disney's New go-to Form for Their Princess Movies,"This is how Disney should portray their princesses. Don't get me wrong, there will always be a place for that damsel-in-distress or ""I must find a man"" mentality from Disney movies... but really, we don't need any more of those. Moana is a strong-willed progressive female who shows us how a ""princess"" (daughter to the chief) can be her own person and not rely on some buff brave man to come and save her every time. A good change of pace from the older Disney movies where women had a very conservative attitude about them. Not necessarily saying that that's bad, if you have that mind sent, but its refreshing to finallysee it in a huge blockbuster Disney movie, especially with the changing attitudes of the world today. My only complaint is that there isn't a lot of character development in the film. She starts out brave and a leader, ends with some more knowledge about sailing and is more brave and more of a leader. Don't get me wrong, I love her character, but it would have been nice for more development."
260,Moana,7,2 April 2017,Your typical Disney movie.,"Moana is a big budget movie by Disney, with hawaian Auli'i Cravalho as Moana, the protagonist of the movie, and Dwayne Johnson as Maui, a legendary shape-shifting demigod, who plays a good cop bad cop routine. This movie has a lot of singing and the classical Walt Disney's rain of gags that splashes your face every second. Usually, in a Disney's movie , there're more hits than misses. In Moana, there's still more hits than misses, but there are more misses than normal. The singing in the movie is alright, with Cravalho providing a stunning singing performance and with an OK Dwayne Johnson, who sadly you realize since the first song he is not a singer. The idea for the story is actually amazing (Which reminded me of The Village, by Shyamalan, about a girl forbidden of abandoning the little island where her family lived, even when she had the most adventurous soul on the island. This idea provided a lot of possibilities to the screenwriter. But when the idea starts to develop, then the movie cuts down to size in terms of quality. The screenplay is kinda cliché and after watching the first half hour, you know how it's gonna end. The screenplay might be the biggest flaw. Still, the animation is really, really good, and there are a lot of great jokes. It will be a lot of fun if you get your kids to watch it, and anyone in the family would enjoy it, because of its light-hearted premise and the family-friendly but smart sense of humour. It's a good film, but it might be one of the weakest of Disney's catalogue, which is near to perfect anyway. I think you should watch it, you will have a good time."
261,Moana,8,20 March 2017,Stunningly beautiful,"Like much Disney animation, it's plagued with forgettable (very un-polynesian) songs I could have done without (with the singular exception of a very-listenable tip of the hat to David Bowie). And the story isn't the strongest - deriving from past Disney and more than a little Miyazaki (which isn't necessarily a bad thing...)But visually, this movie is breathtaking, perhaps in league with Bambi. There are some points where the motion study is so natural and fluid you ALMOST forget you're watching animation, truly ""the illusion of life"". And despite its non-western mythology and absence of white folk, I think old Uncle Walt would have approved. Disney uses Pixar technology, and they've got skin and hair and smoke and clouds nailed. Still some problems with water and especially fire. Textures are looking very natural, the tropical colors clean and saturated. Oh, and there are some points where the motion study is so natural and fluid you ALMOST forget you're watching animation."
262,Moana,8,17 March 2017,A breeze of fresh air,"This movie is a must watch. it is not very different than other animated movies, where the main character tries to achieve the goal, with some obstacles, frustrations then success. the whole beauty lies in colors, details, movements, songs. I think it is brilliant, and watching it will simply make you feel better as if you have traveled to paradise..."
263,Moana,8,11 March 2017,I liked it,"The songs were fun, The characters were interesting, and the visuals were beautiful but the movie was a bit slow at the start and the twist was kinda clichéBut overall. I enjoyed the movie."
264,Moana,9,11 March 2017,Better Than Expected,It made me cry more than once. A great inspirational movie for girls. This movie didn't look very good before I had seen it. Upon watching it though it has great messages about girls being the hero and families/ community. It has had good humour that actually did make me laugh out loud. The songs weren't as good as classic Disney but there were an handful that were really good.
265,Moana,9,10 March 2017,Finally A Disney Princess Of Polynesia,"Watched Moana featuring the Voice Talents of newcomer Auli'i Cravhalo as Moana, Dwayne Johnson(San Andreas) as Maui, Rachel House(Hunt For The Wilderpeople) as Tala , Temura Morrison(Star Wars) as Tui , Jermaine Clement(The BFG) as Tamatoa, Nicole Sherzinger(Men In Black 3) as Sina ,Alan Tudyk(Rogue One) as Hei Hei also voice cameo by Troy Polamalu. The film was enjoyable the Dynamic between Moana and Maui also I really, really enjoyed this take on Polynesian culture and how awesome the Ocean also just enjoyed the layered characters and Adventure . it Musical Score by Lin-Manuel Miranda(The Electric Company ), Mark Mancina(Planes Fire And Rescue ) and Opetaia Foa;i(Amataga) also Amazing Direction by Ron Clements(Hercules) & John Musker(Treasure Planet) Finally A Disney Princess Of Polynesia 9/10"
266,Moana,7,9 March 2017,The Vidiot Reviews...,"MoanaThe best thing about growing up on an island is that it prepares you for if ever you get deserted on one.However, the princess in this animated-musical sees no benefit to island living.The daughter of a domineering chieftain, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) yearns to stray beyond the coral borders of her Polynesian community, but her father forbids voyages abroad for fear of sea-monsters.When she uncovers the real reason behind the leviathans and of her tribe's seafaring legacy, Moana and her pet rooster set sail to capture a shapeshifting demigod (Dwayne Johnson) and liberate an island deity from captivity.Although it does not stray far from the typical Disney princess story standards  an animal sidekick, an overprotective father and a bevy of songs - it does however do a commendable job incorporating those criteria in an amusing fashion. Incidentally, shapeshifting is most useful when you can't find a washroom. Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
267,Moana,7,9 March 2017,7.8 Fair enough. Obviously not Pixar. Haha...,"I appreciated how it paid homage to earlier Disney films; whether that is picked up on or instead called ""cliché "" , ""cookie-cutter"" or too ""annoyingly musical"" is up to the audience. I like musicals and classic Disney so that won the movie over for me.But, it did fall short on what could have been even better scenes or more story. Overall: Refreshing story about a legendary character that hasn't been told; Maui, not Moana. Some cool and memorable songs. But the story left me wanting more and in a sort of disappointed way. *Non-plot related spoilers ahead* -The Kakamora coconut pirates were interesting, but had could have used even just one more scene later. -Would have been nice with scenes of Maui's backstory rather than just talking about it.-Environment. Didn't show as much island. Which is okay. Also comparatively, in Frozen the environment became mostly snow and Moana mostly ocean. But there are beautiful environmental scenes there."
268,Moana,10,5 March 2017,This movie was most excellent!,"This movie was really enjoyable. The songs were well written and helped paint the pictures of the movie so well. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie to watch with their families. The actors that they chose to voice the characters were well thought out. The amount of hard work that has been put into this was really good. All in all, I was rally happy with how this movie turned out. I was not expecting such a great movie. I know that have that so much but I can not stress how much I love this movie. This movie is now one of my favorite Disney movies. I love the fact that this was written around a Polynesian Island family. This will be a favorite of many for years to come. I give this movie a 10/10."
269,Moana,9,5 March 2017,Interesting story,"I liked it. Is a good movie for family and you find interesting facts about the polynisian people. Moana character is nice and in combination with Maui demigod is great. Maui is funny, full of muscle and tattoos and have a chemistry with the polynisian princess. Moana have two ""sidekicks"", a pig and a cock, HeiHei, who are very funny and you will enjoy them along the story."
270,Moana,8,4 March 2017,Another Great Disney Animated Film,"Once again Disney Animation has made another great animated film. Both Moana and Maui make a great duo and it's really fun to watch them work together to achieve their goals. There are also some very fun action scenes and the songs also were good. The animation done to the jungles and the oceans are beautiful and fascinating to look at, so far every new Disney Animation film has improved their animation. As far as issues go, the only problem is that there were parts of the film that felt too quick and some situations were resolved a bit too easily. But even with some of those issues, the film is still a must see for all ages."
271,Moana,7,25 February 2017,A worthy addition to Disney's princess canon,"While Walt Disney Animation Studios have been providing escapism for both children and adults since the 1930s, their attitudes towards more 'exotic' cultures and portrayal of certain racial stereotypes - especially in their early days - have always raised an eyebrow. Perhaps this is why they are now leading the charge in diversity, and after gobbing up billion-dollar franchises and taking them underneath their wing are now dishing up hugely successful blockbusters led by strong-willed heroines and multi-ethnic ensembles. Following the unexpectedly poignant Zootopia earlier this year, the studio have struck gold once again with Moana, a dazzling if comfortable step back into more traditional Disney territory.As the daughter of chief Tui (Temuera Morrison) of the Polynesian island Motunui, the young and naturally curious Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) has a duty to remain with her family to watch over her people. But she has dreams of sailing out to sea to explore the unknown lands beyond the horizon, and it would seem that the sea agrees with her, as it parts to reveal a precious stone early on before her father insists that she return home. The island has always provided everything the inhabitants need to survive and flourish, but without warning, fish numbers are starting to dwindle and the coconuts are rotting, and it would seem that an age-old fable of the theft of island goddess Te Fiti's heart is to blame. The story names powerful demigod Maui as the thief, and tells how he was later shipwrecked by a lava demon after losing the heart and his magical fish hook. Defying her father's wishes, Moana goes in search of Maui to restore the heart and save her island from starvation.Written by, amongst others, Disney legends Ron Clements and John Musker, Moana is incredibly straight-forward, reaching back to the likes of The Little Mermaid (1989), Aladdin (1992) and Hercules (1997) for a proved formula that served them so well during the studio's renaissance. The film often reflects on this, with Maui (voiced by Dwayne Johnson, who always sings and does it well) pointing out that although she may not be a princess per se, she has the look, spirit and animal sidekick to fit the profile. It doesn't take long to pick up on the fact that you're not watching anything striving for originality, but you'll be too taken aback by the gorgeous visuals on show and the stellar voice acting bringing these familiar Disney archetypes to life to care. Very much a warmer companion piece to Frozen (2013), Moana feels both classical and very modern.Also like Frozen, there are many memorable tunes to enjoy, here by Broadway composer and playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and Oceanic musician Opetaia Foa'i, although none of which will reach the dizzy heights of 'Let It Go'. One particularly toe-tapping number comes from Jemaine Clement as a treasure-hording crab, whose unmistakably Flight of the Conchords-esque twang may suggest he had more input that simply providing the vocal chords. Yet for all the jaw-dropping animation and comic relief prat-falls of pet rooster Heihei (Alan Tudyk), the main strength of Moana is Moana herself; stubborn, intelligent and incredibly capable, she doesn't rely on men to save the day, nor does she get distracted by a love interest. It's here that Disney manage to subtly subvert expectations without rubbing your face in it, creating a well-rounded and believable character in the process. An extremely worthy addition to Disney's princess canon, Moana proves that a dose of heart and imagination can reignite even the most done-to-death of formulas."
272,Moana,,7 February 2017,It's just alright,"This film tells the story of a daughter of a Polynesian chief, who is fascinated by the ocean. However, the chief forbids anyone sail past the reefs, even when fishing is no longer possible in their island waters.There are funny moments in ""Moana"", such as the scene when her hair slaps onto her face, and the comment about her giving the sky a high five. The coconuts are funny as well, and I think the fight with coconuts is the best part of the film. The crab, however, is the worst part of the film. I can't quite stand the songs of the crab, and the glittery effect of his shell somehow just doesn't seem right. The final monster made of lava looks quite scary, I think it could be too scary for children. Overall, I think it is a passable film, but I don't really like the songs in the film."
273,Moana,8,2 February 2017,"Expect a fun, good time. But has room for potential","Moana is a beautiful and stunning film, the best parts of the film being the animation and the music, of course with Lin-Manuel MIranda on board this project. So Moana is actually an animated film that I've been following since they casted Auli'i Cravalho, I watched the clip released by Disney in which they told her that she got the part, along with Dwayne Johnson being on board I was immediately attracted to this project. I thought that it was really great that Disney decided to venture to a more different model for their Disney princesses brand and to explore a culture as fascinating as the Polynesian culture.The end result a brilliant film that is really just a fun exciting adventure. The voice acting was stellar both from new comer Auli'i or Dwayne Johnson and it was really great seeing their two characters on screen bonding and getting used to working together. The music in the film was fun and catchy with very meaningful lyrics without being too in your face and having the characters break into song every scene, the musical pieces were used sparingly and reasonably. So, I would like to compare this to two of Disney's recent properties. First of all: Frozen, Frozen was alright in my opinion, compared to Moana I do believe that Moana is for a slightly more mature audience and though Frozen touches on certain important and deep aspects regarding the love between siblings it seemed a much more introverted film. Of course perhaps due to the actual story of the film however there was always something that never clicked with me when it comes to Frozen and the vast openness of Moana seems to be the difference maker that made me enjoy this movie a lot more. The second film is last year's, Zootopia. Now this is a film that Disney has produced that I feel does a great job in conveying very mature themes. With a film like Moana, it is fun and adventurous but could do with in my opinion some more mature aspects, perhaps touch on issues such as environmental or deal with nature as it sort of already does. I do feel that things like that is the next step for Disney, to really put what they have done in Zootopia into practice on some of its other properties."
274,Moana,10,28 January 2017,A true masterpiece without an equal!,"I have no idea really why the bashing of such an amazing title! and only the 8.0 score? really people? this movie has left me and my family with jaw open and tears in our eyes throughout the entire movie. People like frozen and they don't like Moana? really? whats wrong with people? It deserves every Oscar and every nomination there is.*Awesome story *no annoying love story *Great singing even there was allot it was enjoyable *Great animation *Feel good factor after the movie *Watch it again? absolutely!Please get your **** together guys. This is one of the best movies i have ever seen, the fact that Disney continues to impress me like this is just awesome, i thought i would never see more good movies from them.Nothing less than a true masterpiece! Please make more good movies."
275,Moana,7,22 January 2017,Great Children's Film,"As a passionate lover of classic Disney Movies, I haven't been as excited about the newer CGI Disney movies as I should be. Although Moana was a wonderful film with exciting action sequences, lovable characters, and catchy tunes thanks to Lin Manuel-Miranda's more modern approach to music, it somehow lacks the movie magic that Disney used to constantly deliver on in the past. However, if you truly enjoy films like Tangled, Frozen, or Brave, then Moana is definitely the movie for you. Moana is still lighthearted, fun, and of course delivers a valuable message to anyone looking for strength. You and your kids are sure to get some enjoyment out of this film."
276,Moana,8,20 January 2017,Moana,"I find it encouraging to see Disney venturing into ""original"" stories, increasingly far from the fairy tales and European folklore which supported the success of the studio during its beginnings. Films such as Wreck-It Ralph, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia displayed a genuine desire to break old schemes and try new things; but, at the same time, Disney needs to ""cover its bases"" with occasional movies about princesses, which imply a lesser economic risk and exploit marketing strategies refined through various decades. All that means that, even though the characters and culture of the film Moana might be new, the themes and archetypes handled will end up being very familiar to the followers of Disney. And I don't find that bad at all; after all, those are concepts which were established since the beginnings themselves of narrative art and, whenever they are well handled, they make films like Moana become amusing tales which work in multiple levels. In this case, the adventure of the girl who defies the tradition of her tribe is simultaneously an emotive ""coming of age"" tale, a didactic fable about the importance of ""follow your dreams"" and an ecological allegory which inspires us to respect the natural balance of the universe. However, these reliable and efficient clichés decrease novelty to the movie, and they dilute its charm a bit. The images offered by Moana are genuinely spectacular; the characters are very likable, with perfect voices complementing their design; and the music is contagious, with enough ethnic taste, but keeping itself accessible... but it's impossible to avoid the sensation that we had already seen all this... in repeated occasions. Even though the details change, the experience is very familiar: the ""special"" girl with aspirations overcoming her environment; the inspiring advice of a semi-magical character; the supernatural help. And I also have a few complaints against the second half of the film, when the story languishes under the weight of filler to add drama and action without too much dramatic support. Everything starts with the crab's song, and it's prolonged with the feminist number which feels more like an ode to political correction than a sincere ideology. Don't misunderstand me... I admire and celebrate the feminist tone of Moana, but it's the type of ingredient which should be organically integrated to the story, instead of becoming it a specific ""event"" which slows down the rhythm of the film while feeling redundant, because the same result had been obtained with the solid development of Moana herself, probably the ""princess"" with the most realism in Disney's animated filmography. Nevertheless, the pros widely surpass the cons. The animation and design are extraordinary; and Dwayne Johnson and Auli'i Cravalho make an excellent voice work while having a solid chemistry with each other, either during the dramatic moments, the exciting action sequences and the well balanced humor which lightens the relationship between their characters. In conclusion, Moana is a satisfactory and very entertaining experience, and it left me more satisfied than any other Disney ""princess movie"" in many years (I liked Frozen, but it left me a bit cold... I'm not kidding). In short: I think it's a good moment to leave my prejudices against Disney animation aside. Their effort to change is evident, and the results speak by themselves. I finally feel they are making their legacy justice."
277,Moana,8,25 November 2016,Another princess joins the Disney ranks.,"Moans has to save her world. Don't you think there will be a Disney ending. Rather then a parent dying it's the Grandmother who goes, but she is always with Moana.Every Disney hero has a side kick. Moana has a pig, but mostly a chicken. The movie has an Island score and there are plenty of songs that seem similar. The songs are well performed and the leads are voiced outstanding.The entire family will enjoy the movie. Smaller kids may be scared out of the theater by the villains who are very intense. The movie looks good on the big screen and should be seen in a theater. After it's theatrical run it will get a lot of plays on home platforms."
278,Moana,6,22 February 2017,Take aways from Moana,"1. Another Disney princess story? Seems like they care less about originality and more on selling merchandise. 2. On the other hand, Disney's first Polynesian princess. 3. Coconut pirates? Really?? 4. That ocean is way too blue. 5. For a PG rated film, the dialogue was at a preschool level. 6. The coconut crab's song was more of an insult than a tribute to the late David Bowie. 7. The climax scene was dramatically appealing and amazing. 8. The Oscars totally blew it by nominating the song ""How Far I'll Go"" instead of ""We Know the Way."" Someone must have mislabeled that mixtape. 9. Retitle this movie to ""The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker"" and this would have been totally awesome!"
279,Moana,7,15 February 2017,"Moana is good, nothing great, nothing bad, just good","I was interested in seeing Moana already for the concept and that it is directed by one of my favorite directors Ron Clements and John Musker who give me movies that i loved like Treasure Planet and Aladdin. And when i saw it, it didn't disappoint me. The best thing is the animation. Is the most beautiful animation i ever seen in a Disney movie. The water, the characters designs and Moana expressions are the most watchable thing i ever see. The characters are decent expect Moana and Maui who i think are the most likable. Moana as a character is so pretty, more that the rest of Disney Princess. Maui is a little bit annoying in the beginning, but then he most likable in the rest of the film and it has some of the funniest lines in the movie. The movie has more jokes that in any Disney princess movies and sometime is hilarious. The songs are good, 3 of them are fantastic and the rest are OK or unnecessary in the film. And the last good thing in the film are the voice cast who the most part is phenomenal. Auli'i Cravalho as his first role is so beautiful and fantastic that who she did the voice of Moana and Dwayne Johnson is funny as Maui. But the film has some troubles in the writing like some clichés or conveniences that happens in the film. Some jokes are not funny when is gross humor. And the crab villain is not funny or interesting and makes the movie boring. And some of the song are unnecessary. But overall, Moana is better movie that Frozen o Tangled in respect of characters or writing. Is not better that Zootopia, but is enjoyable for everyone.7.4/10"
280,Moana,10,23 January 2017,Moana,"Moana is another Disney classic. The movie was just not great, but the music was great as well. Moana was one of those movies where you just don't want it to end, but when it does it end you will be speechless. I saw this movie twice the first time I saw it I saw it in 3D and it was some of the best 3D I have ever seen in a animated movie then the second time I saw it in 2D and it was still great.Parents this is a Disney movie so I don't see anything wrong with this because Disney is just pure amazing. The film was so good that I want to see it a third and forth time. I loved it I hope you enjoyed the movie too and if you have not seen it I hope you enjoy Moana a lot.This has been the best Disney film so far and I really hope you agree with me because this is a great film"
281,Moana,10,24 January 2017,She is Moana - Disney Classic,"Disney Animation ruled the box office with both Zootopia and Finding Dory crossing $1 Billion but it's Moana which will be hailed as Disney Classic. Just like Disney is Making Live-Action version of its animated classic , Moana will be the first Modern one to get that treatment. I was just left speechless and didn't wanted this movie to end. First of all , it's the magic of Disney. To cultivate the culture of Polynesian , I have never seen it on big screen and it was magical. It made me want to go out to that place and enjoy the rich culture of such wonderful people. I don't know why Moana couldn't earn as much as others , still a huge hit. Starting from the story itself , it's adventurous and full of mythical elements and so close to nature. The Characters well Moana is my Favorite Disney Princess (sorry Elsa)just because early Disney Princess have always played it along their comfort zone and they knew what they are doing but Moana is all about finding about yourself , the journey of knowing your true self. Dwayne The Rock as Maui is instantly likable and humorous. The Best thing about this movie is the voice of Auli'i Cravalho and the soundtrack by Lin Manuel Miranda. The songs especially How Far I'll Go and We Know the Way Captures what this story is all about. Disney is making such great films this way. On one hand where pixar is more about hitting the heart and maturity Disney is the one and especially through this film , it is the one that reminds me of what Disney movies are like, just plain Magic. Many people believe animated movies are for kids but hey I am 18 year old man and I can't stop praising this movie. Forget about the Direction or Script it is the magical impact that Moana lefts us behind which is the best part of this movie. Also the last time I saw female lead actually play the female lead in a movie was Hidden Figures so hats off to that too. Towards the end as it was ending I didn't wanted it to end. Based on such rich themes the end for me was PERFECT in every way I could imagine and Disney managed to put a very strong message about Environment through this which is also amazing. One more thing is the much modernized and ver nice quality animation.Every leaf, ever drop of eater , every strand of hair is crafted with much details which clearly shows the hard work of so many hours. As speaking for Oscars , there is stiff competition From Zootopia as well as City of Stars from La La Land but for me it's already the best of the year.Go on Disney Make more movies like this with such awesome soundtrack. I also hope Lin Manuel Miranda gets the much deserving MacPEGOT (He has MacArthur Foundation , Pulitzer , Emmy , Grammy and Tony) so only Oscar is left . I do hope he wins for How Far I'll go.Well Even if he doesn't he is starring in Mary Poppins returns , and Giving Music for The Little Mermaid among others so it's a win- win for him. Finally, MOANA is one of those self discoveries about oneself that needs to be watched, it's epic it's SIMPLY CLASSIC."
282,Moana,10,24 January 2017,Beyond Expectation,"Such a masterpiece! Had long expected to see this movie, viewed several trailers, I thought this was going to be about how awesome a demigod would look like(personally I think it would be interesting) by fighting around monsters and saving the world.But Moana is not just about heart-beating awesomeness(though this is definitely one of the reasons why you must see the movie!), and massive visual effects. When Moana explores the sea, she is also exploring her long-living dream! The music sung by heart, with her soul beyond that endless ocean... Since the beginning of the movie, your heart is grasped, your breath is taken away, you forget who you are, why you are here--But you are here, together with the child, exploring both of your dreams--To make your dream come true! An adventure is never enough, without knowing why you are on this adventure and why you must be. Every minute I watched the movie, I was getting inspired and moved, how beautiful a movie Moana was! The characters are so vivid, I did not find anyone that was replaceable, even pets, and they are even critical factors to Moana's success.And again, what an amazing story, if you have not seen it, what are you waiting for?"
283,Moana,8,16 January 2017,Moana ShowMeTheMovies Review,"Disney's new animated presentation from the creator's of Frozen had a great deal to live up to - and surpassed every expectation.Many of Disney's past animated films with musical aspects have always often irritated me in different ways - I never thought Tangled was great, and Frozen was simply obnoxious to watch. I'm very much aware that my opinion is much against the tide of the rest of the world, particularly with Frozen and its ridiculously famous Let it Go leading track, which I didn't even consider enjoyable either.Considering the opinion that I hold on animated Disney (except Pixar, they are exceptional 80% of the time) I thought that Moana would sit as a 5/10 at best, considering Disney are very talented at sticking to a formula that makes money: but I couldn't have been more wrong. Naturally, Moana certainly does fit into this same formula, and it certainly will have made a very sizeable profit, but despite this the film was incredibly enjoyable regardless.The overall plot is quite typical of any animated kid's movie as a whole, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) is a girl who lives on an ancient island which is becoming affected by a curse - fish begin to die, villagers start worrying about food etc - and Moana believes that the solution to her problems lies beyond the reef, away from her island, where no one has allegedly been before. Her father is the chief of the tribe that reside on the island, and wants Moana to take his place when she is of age, so he is very much opposed to the idea of her travelling away from the island.This all lines up to the generic overbearing-parent/adventurous-child dynamic, where Moana longs to travel, and her father is desperate to keep her restricted to the island during the entirety of her childhood. This isn't exactly pushing the boat out (I'm funny) when it comes to an original plot, and when Moana eventually leaves the island with the encouragement of her Grandmother, the real adventure begins.What is absolutely worth mentioning is the music, since How Far I'll Go was nominated for a Golden Globe (and likely will be for an Oscar) for best original song. While La La Land took the award, this track deserved its spot on the nominees list at least, as this is a Disney song which is not only listenable, but enjoyable and - and this is important - leagues above Let it Go. It's clear the creators of Moana understood that this song would really be a hit, since they reprise the song two or three times more during the film, which does make it a bit stale by the end - but Cravalho's voice seems perfect for not only voice acting as Moana, but also in performing How Far I'll Go.There are other original tracks in the film, Maui (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) does perform as well, but none of them resonated as much as the main track. However, other than the song that he performs, Maui was absolutely my favourite character in the film. This is far and away Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's best presentation in any film, playing a demi-god who has caused the curse that Moana's island is affected by, mainly through his own ignorance. And that's what Maui is during the time you meet the character; an ignorant, self-absorbed moron who is too focused on his own image to actually help anyone using the status he possesses as a demi-god. Moana attempts to find him to try and fix the curse, and Maui is our reluctant hero in this adventure.What I really loved about Maui is that there is absolutely no reason for him to be so full of himself, he is stripped of his shapeshifting abilities when Moana discovers him, and he has essentially caused all of the problems that he and Moana face during the film, yet his ego is still huge, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's execution makes this somewhat charming. The relationship that Moana has with him is naturally quite rocky (I'm very funny) to begin with; Moana tries to command Maui to fix the curse and Maui tries to leave Moana to rot on an island and steals her boat. Despite this, they do work together during the film and their relationship grows to a point of admiration and empathy of one another - without spoiling anything. The actors clearly work in conjunction very well, and Maui was one of the main reasons I really enjoyed this movie.Overall, Moana is incredibly enjoyable, even if it follows the typical Disney formula. The plot may have been particularly generic, but every performance in the film really hit a high note and the animation style, while Disney's usual, still had moments of spectacle. Even for a children's movie, I would wholeheartedly recommend this film to any child or adult, because either demographic will likely find this film really entertaining."
284,Moana,7,14 January 2017,Beyond Expectations,"I am reviewing this film because it did something unprecedented: It invested me. I seriously wanted Moana to succeed and to know what would happen next. I even got choked during the scene where the grandmother's ghost appears despite it obviously being cribbed from Lion King. This is the first Disney movie that I, as an adult and not a kid, enjoyed as it is. With many Disney movies I found that the protagonists' minds were not explored enough; here, I felt we got to know the characters sufficiently. After the disaster that was Frozen, this is a great relief. However, I am used to feeling smarter than Disney movies, so I feel defeated by liking this. I feel more defeated still by liking the songs since Lin Manuel Miranda, whose personality I REALLY resent, had a hand in writing them. I totally predicted that the volcano spirit was really the island goddess. The plot was quite reminiscent of Lion King and Little Mermaid, but at least there's no romance. It is clear whoever writes these movies are becoming more aware of what people think of them, which results in some really funny moments. Oh, yeah, I was legitimately laughing at this! My favorite moments both involved Maui a) when Moana falls all that way down and he says ""Well, she's dead."" That was my exact thought before he said it. The screenwriter must watch Cinema Sins. My other favorite moment was when he said ""If you're going to sing, I'm gonna throw up."" Nice to have a little cynicism in a Disney movie.Last but not least, the film looks breathtaking. I really wanted to be in these settings, especially the demonic coral reef world. Everything looks so photographically real, yet more vivid than life. Maybe Moana is what taking drugs at the beach is like. In conclusion, this is top-notch entertainment for you and/or your kids."
285,Moana,9,4 January 2017,Twizard Rating: 92,"In recent years it seems like digital animation is becoming more and more advanced with each movie being released. But the changes are gradual and often expected. We talk about how the scenery looks just like a photograph, or how animals look like they could be real. However, actual humanity is the one thing that seems to be taking the longest to become lifelike. This is where Moana comes in.While still maintaining that cartoon-like feel, this is the first time where actual human characters' emotions look real. In the past, expressions take on very on-the-nose clichés. Not necessarily over-the-top, but just very obvious. Here, we get facial expressions that look just like yours and mine. It's eerie. It helps us feel for the characters more--especially when it comes to our title character.Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho) is a teenager growing up on the Polynesian island of Motunui and longs to explore the ocean. However, her father, Chief Tui, forbids her to leave. The one rule they have on the island is that they cannot go beyond the reef. But Moana is stubborn. Even as the island's resources are running out, she resiliently tries to persuade her father, but to no avail.Her grandmother gives her a small magical stone known as the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. A thousand years prior, demigod, Maui (Dwayne Johnson), stole the heart, which is causing each island, one by one, to dry up. Moana sets out to find Maui so he can return the heart to the goddess.Disney churns out a solid formula piece with Moana. This is a criticism in some respect. But it can also work to its advantage. The general storyline doesn't really give us any sort of new beats. A girl sets off to do something that we all know she will probably end up accomplishing. We foresee each false victory before it occurs. It starts out predictable and pulls from countless of its Disney predecessors. But it does one thing that's very unusual for a Disney film--it lacks romance of any kind. The two protagonists--of opposite sex--have a strictly platonic relationship. Love isn't the point of the film at all. It's so ingrained in our expectations that it catches us off guard and we are constantly reminding ourselves that the movie isn't about that.Moana is a captivating protagonist. Whether or not the writing makes her that way. The animation is just that good. There is one musical sequence where they backdrop the characters against a relatively primitive animated background, which has become an ordinary device used in countless films before. But upon looking at the canvas, it almost seems like it has been thrown into a live-action film. In past instances, there wasn't as much of a discrepancy, but now the juxtaposition shows just how far we've come with animation.I could gush for paragraphs about the visuals of this movie. But that would only end up overshadowing the film's other strength--its music.Lin-Manuel Miranda writes some brilliantly catchy songs--perhaps the best, pound-for-pound, in recent Disney musical history. From the refreshingly bright islandy ""Where You Are"" to the macabre Bowie-inspired ""Shiny"", each track hits hard and becomes addicting. All except for Maui's solo piece, ""You're Welcome."" It's Dwayne Johnson's only song and is marginal at best. The others are creative and take melodic turns that you never expect, but this one falls into the basic realm of uninspired, perhaps best appreciated by your toddler child. It merely goes through the motions, and only appears worse amidst its brilliant companions.The songs may be fantastic, but the dialogue is curiously weak, and unfortunately separates Moana from the past Disney bunch. At times it feels like it was written by a teenager--or perhaps someone who wanted to sound like one. The comedy gets childish in a couple of instances, though, to its credit, quickly snaps back. Then there's Maui's character, who can grate on you a bit. His shtick is a little too colloquial and his jokes often fall flat.But the film heads in the right direction overall. Often times going one step back and two steps forward. It nicely sticks to its narrative with Moana's perspective, and never seems to be challenged by it.The story could have been merely a device to flex its aesthetic guns (it's not), but it would have all been worth it just to experience the beauty of what's on screen. Here, the movie isn't just telling a story, but creating a full experience--something unexpectedly rare these days.Twizard Rating: 92"
286,Moana,6,25 January 2017,Enjoyable but forgettable,"Disney has been having some very hard times in the past 2 decades with hits that are not memorable past 2 year mark. Moana has some beautiful visuals and the mythology of Maori people is interesting indeed but the movie is one of the worst cookie cutters of Disney in a while, the last one this bad was Brave and even Brave had a better sense to its clichés than Moana. The biggest problem with Moana is the lack of any actual challenge or opposition. Everything is just handed to her in the most typical Disney way possible. Do you remember Finding Dory's scene when we finally found her parents? We had been facing some fierce challenge and by the time the parents were shown many believed that the moral of this story is to try hard to achieve the dreams but not linger in the past and then she wad rewarded for her hard work by being reunited with the parents. Here there is literally no reason to feel anything for Moana and Maoi was the one that I found more memorable although still pretty simple and at the end very forgettable. The songs also were bad, it felt like watching some operett written by elementary school students. The opening song wad OK and you're welcome also was a bit of fun but the rest were just uninspired deliverance of lines on a bad rhythm and bland melody. At the end ""fight"" where the ocean was literally helping Moana I was wondering why didn't the ocean fix the problem itself. There was literally no reason for Moana to be dragged into this whole mess. When you think of some of the best animations out this year you have Kubo and two strings, you have Zootopia and then you have this movie. If you were to look back only a few years you would see that Moana will not even stand at top 10 let alone anywhere near the top. A shame since Moana could have been much better. Disney needs to work harder on its animations. Just compare this to Mulan or Princess and the frog and you see the gap in storytelling quality is too wide"
287,Moana,9,24 January 2017,I will only say: It is true Walt Disney movie,"I don't know about the rest of people writing reviews here, but I am older generation of ""kids"" :) I remember when Disney was at his prime, and their movies ware fun, entertaining, full of joy and good singalong songs. For a long time, Disney was not that...new-generation directors, storytellers, cartoon artists and many others lost touch with old traditional good movies. They experimented with different styles of telling stories, but there was not successful in that, and Disney lost that charm that it had. This movie returned me my young self, with all the songs, breathtaking and funny moments. You go through roller-coaster of emotions from beginning to the end of movie, and it is so perfectly composed into one great unity.I agree, there ware some songs and tones of movie that ware kinda out of place, but you ""survive"" it, and already in next scene, you forgot about it, and you can enjoy in new incredible views that this movie provides.When I first heard of main casting, I was a little skeptical of ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson, because, I was under the impression that Hollywood is pushing him into a lot of movies, just to earn more money, and this was one of them. BUT, although he is GREAT actor (proven him self a lot of times), he was PERFECT for this part. He is ""Maui"", he was so merged with that character, you can envision him in movie.As for the technical aspect of animation, there can only be words of praise and great-job-done! Water, hair, colors, hand-body and rest of movement ware so good done, that it could be said it is lifelike.All in all, I love that Disney decided to return to it's roots, and brought us warm-cliché-loving movies that we all appreciate and need. There are new generation kids that need this kind of movies, because, we are drowning in too much reality shows, dramas, tragedy's and shallow-minded ""comedies"". For me, a great movie is the one that is re-watchable again and again, and whenever it comes to TV, you sit and watch it again, and not the movies that after once watched, you never come back and watch it again. This one goes to RE-WATCHABLE category. Thank you Disney."
288,Moana,10,9 January 2017,Fun - Fun - Fun,"This is a Excellent movie! But From where came those gods? If they came from Hawaii or other Islands on the Pacific, Disney should put a Tks on the beginning or on the end of the movie for the inspiration of the Movie. Did their society was like our society? with one Marriage for one family? Or could they be like Sparta (A totally destroyed people)? Disney could also hire Consultants from the Natives who still are there telling those histories!!! The major Gang of God and/or Prophets (Jewish god, juzsys, ahla and buda) did not destroyed all those wonderful Histories from human past!- But I like to study and ask question, but if you watch the movie just for FUN, this is a great FUN too."
289,Moana,,18 December 2016,Color by numbers kids film. Borrows from many others. Good for kids.,"We saw this with our 2-year old. She enjoyed it. It's compared to Frozen and has some of the same producers. However, this film is no Frozen. While it follows a similar structure to Frozen, the ""color by numbers"" themes, songs, and production feel a bit tired. I enjoy the South Pacific theme and feel they could have made this a great film, but they have made a good film that is good for kids. This empowered character uses the ""sea"" where Frozen used ice. The main songs are soaring, but not as memorable as Frozen. The ""radio versions"" of the songs seem overly commercial. The main male character's complexity is vastly cartoonish and overplayed. He's bad, then good. Ego- maniac, then humble. Moana is a sweet and empowering character that works well, but the story around her gets increasingly absurd and zany. Sorry, this is only a good film, not a great one."
290,Moana,8,30 November 2016,"Not as good as classic Disney animation, but it is a very well made and entertaining film.","'MOANA': Four Stars (Out of Five) Disney's 56th animated feature is this computer-animated fantasy film, starring the voice talent of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. The film tells the story of an ancient Polynesian tribe, that's suffering the damage of a horrible curse, when the Chieftain's teenage daughter sets out to end it. She seeks the help of a demigod named Maui, who also caused the curse. The film also features the voices of Auli'i Cravalho (a debut actress, who was cast at the age of just 14), Alan Tudyk, Jemaine Clement, Temuera Morrison, Nicole Scherzinger and Rachel House. It was directed by Ron Clements, John Musker, Don Hall and Chris Williams (Clements and Musker previously co-directed other Disney animated hits, like 'THE LITTLE MERMAID', 'ALADDIN', 'HERCULES' and 'THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG', and Hall and Williams previously co-directed Disney's 'BIG HERO 6'). It was written by Jared Bush, Pamela Ribon and Aaron and Jordan Kandell; along with Clements, Musker, Hall and Williams. The film has been a huge hit at the Box Office, and it's also done impressively well with critics. I enjoyed it. Moana (Johnson) is the daughter of the chief (Morrison) of a Polynesian tribe, on an island of fisherman. When the fish vanish, due to a curse caused by a demigod named Maui (Johnson), Moana sets out to stop it. She finds the arrogant demigod who caused the curse, and demands he help her. Maui reluctantly agrees and the two go an adventuresome journey together; with the mystical help of the ocean itself. The story is loosely based on Polynesian mythology. The film is beautifully animated and quite colorful. The characters are all likable, and there's even some touching emotional depth (especially towards the end of the movie). Johnson is perfectly cast, and ​ Cravalho does a pretty impressive job as well (for such a young debut actress). There's even a nice message about respecting all life in there, including animals (and not eating them). It's not as good as classic Disney animation, but it is a very well made and entertaining film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/193849869"
291,Moana,8,25 November 2016,Good Stuff,"Disney's newest incarnation of the Disney Princess brand, comes chalked full of Disney whimsy, high-quality Disney grade animation, all set to memorable Disney songs and time-tested Disney formula. Did I mention Moana is a Disney movie? The thing about Disney though is you can't argue with its results. They know what their doing and even when they prove the most craven to make a buck, we still absolutely love them for it. I love them!And I also love Moana, an original story based on ancient Polynesian legends and folklore. The movie tells the tale of a youthful chieftain's daughter (Cravalho) who goes on a glorious adventure; aided by an unwilling Demigod named Maui (Johnson). Seems before the time of humans, Maui stole an artifact from the God, Te Fiti and after losing it in glorious battle, the islands of the South Pacific are cursed. A millenia later, the curse has spread to Moana's island where she and her village squabble over what to do. Her father, an isolationist- type simply wants to grow coconut groves on another part of the island. Moana on the other hand believes the legends of Maui and his magical fishhook, and casts off to return the artifact to Te Fiti.As with quite a few films marking Disney's ought-10 renaissance, Moana liberally tailors itself to a well-worn formula with a 21st century twist that would seem aggressive, if not for the fact that the film is a Disney cartoon. In Moana's case, our protagonist is a strong independent woman who goes on a perilous adventure with an animal sidekick but she doesn't fall in love or find herself needing to be rescued. This is despite that fact that she is wayfinding with literally the only guy on the open ocean for thousands of miles and the man is a muscular, heroic Demigod.The difference here however is nearly nothing she does is a result of, nor contrary to, the limitations of traditional gender roles. She is (of course) forbidden to venture beyond the reef of her island by her father, but not because she's a dainty, pretty thing that needs to be protected. No, it's because no one is allowed outside the reef. Maui, at first finds her useless but not because of her gender but rather because she's a product of generations of Polynesians who never sailed before. Finally when she proves herself capable of everything we need a hero in this story to be, none of it feels like a fissure in the fabric of a society. The gender politics of Moana are a big deal precisely because none of it is a big deal.This in addition to being a well researched, respectable, if Disney- fied travelogue on Polynesian culture puts this flick above the mark as far as decent family-oriented fare. The music, while not as memorable as Frozen (2015), still has an undeniable crackle. Think Lin-Manuel Miranda's ""In the Heights"" soundtrack partially sung in Tokelauan and you get an idea on how textured, fun and witty the songs can be.Moana is fun, Moana is scrappy, Moana is...well, Moana, for all it's pleasures is still guided by the exact same hero's journey story structures that have defined animated movies for well over a generation. Does that make the film bad; of course not. But when it gets painfully obvious the film is filling for time, the obvious structure prevents the film from truly being great."
292,Moana,8,30 November 2016,Moana was another entertaining Disney computer-animated feature,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who hadn't previously seen it, either. It's the tale of a determined young woman who's trying to resurrect her island with the help of a jewel and a god-like man named Maui. There's also a bunch of songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda provided to give credence to the characterizations. Possibly the Frozen success of Disney's previously computer-animated feature was a factor here. Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) is the voice of Maui and he's funny and quite good with his one song. The title heroine is quite plucky and charismatic. It's possible I might have been partly confused by some of the narrative but still, this was quite entertaining in the usual Disney way. So on that note, me and my friend recommend Moana."
293,Moana,7,27 December 2016,Escape to the South Pacific,"Disney might try to tell you this is all about Hawaii, but it has it's origins in New Zealand, in fact using quite a few Kiwi talents. Once Were Warriors star Temuera Morrison is the Island Chief preparing his daughter Moana to be next in line, but she's drawn by the powerful forces of the Ocean. 19 year old Auli'i Cravalho voices Moana. We don't meet the great Demi-God Maui voiced by Dwayne Johnson until he breaks out in his wonderful song ""You're Welcome""...which is worth the price of admission alone. Jermaine Clement from Flight of the Conchords has a star turn as a crustacean with his brilliant Tim Curry-esque song ""Shiny"". Rachel House from Hunt For the Wilderpeople is the spiritual Gramma Tala. And at the helm of all of this is Aladdin writer Ron Clements in the Directors chair...with screenplay from the Zootopia's Jared Bush."
294,Moana,7,9 December 2016,Enjoyed the jokes,"A typical Disney movie. Enjoyed the jokes. There ware laughters through out the movie, relaxing. The music and songs are also nice. Makes me want to learn a couple of these. Pretty sure the characters will be popular, at least for the near future. But they probably will be ordinary among the popular Disney characters. In other words, they will be known for a few months, maybe up to a year, but will be fading thereafter. The imagines are great. High definition, vivid, like always from Disney. Thanks to technology, I guess, you'll get good stuff as long as you've got a decent budget and spent it in the right places. Worth the ticket. The little ones will be well entertained. Nothing stunning, though. I would say."
295,Moana,7,7 December 2016,Disney's Usual Top-Quality,"Moana is, in many ways, exactly what you'd expect from a 'Disney Princess' movie. It's story follows the fundamental formula that has done Disney so well for decades, mixing in Polynesian mythology to spice it up a bit. We have our titular heroine, born into a place of responsibilities, embarking on a journey of self-discovery to save her people, with the help of comic companions and fantastical entities. I mean, it's Disney, this is what they do, time and time again, so I won't judge too harshly. Although there is no love interest - no prince - and that was certainly a welcome diversion from the formula.Of course what sets Moana apart is it's setting and mythology. The world is dying because Te Fiti, the goddess of life, has lost her heart, stolen by ""hero of men"" Maui. Moana is chosen by the ocean to find Maui and together bring the heart back to Te Fiti, and stop the death and decay encroaching on her island. While it's fundamentally full of tropes and clichés, a lot of mythology across the world is full of the same stories supplanted with different characters. Is Moana an accurate representation of this culture? Maybe, I'm not exactly an expert, but the directors did go out of their way to research this world of islands and ocean, so I'm inclined to believe it's reasonably respectful.The animation manages to bring this paradisaical world to life with vibrant colours and beautiful landscapes. This is Disney, so of course the animation is super top-quality. There really isn't much to fault. I didn't notice it particularly breaking any new ground, but the sheer attention to detail paid to the ocean waves, the grains of sand, Maui's skin, and Te Fiti in general were certainly impressive sights to behold. Most noticeably it's not all CGI. All the tattoos are hand- drawn, which makes Maui's little tattoo companion all the more impressive. There's also a scene late into Maui's introductory song where the backdrop is 2D animation, which helped it stand out as a scene, but I'm not entirely it worked from a visual stand point, as Maui and Moana remain in 3D and stick out really obviously.The songs were a bit of a disappointment. Disney is usually great with their musical choices, but Moana's songs just lacked something. It didn't help that the characters constantly pointed out that they were singing, or saying they wanted to avoid another song. It took me out of the immersion even further than the actual Musical elements themselves. For me, I was looking forward to some songs in a Polynesian style, or at least Hawaiian, with ukuleles and other indigenous instruments and vocal methods. Instead each song sounded like normal run-of-the- mill American pop songs, generic and safe, and only marginally catchy.Tamatoa's song was super reminiscent of David Bowie in a homage to the late musician, which in itself is great, but it felt misplaced in this movie, and in the pool of Disney Villain songs, is probably one of the weakest of the lot. Maui's song was probably my favourite, and hearing Dwayne Johnson actually sing was definitely a welcome surprise. That said, and this is a niggle from a musically trained ear, the amount of auto-tune he required was painfully obvious, particularly during the chorus. Moana's song was quite enjoyable, and it's reprise late in the movie was really cool, highlighting the development she has endured as a character on this journey, but it wasn't particularly catchy. It's certainly not even in the same league as Let it Go, or Be My Guest, or Defeat the Huns, or any of the timeless classic musical numbers Disney have had.The voice acting was really good, again unsurprising coming from Disney. I will say though, the choice of casting is a landmark for a blockbuster family movie, or any big budget movie for that matter. Almost every member of the cast has pacific heritage, be it Hawaiian or Maori, and while that ultimately doesn't account for much when all you get of them is their voices, it was nonetheless a fantastic choice behind-the-scenes that I cannot commend Disney for enough. Dwayne Johnson proves once again that he is so underrated as an actor. He's more than just an ex-wrestler. His voice performance as Maui is definitely one of the high points of the entire movie, perfectly embodying the peak and troughs of Maui's egotistical, but fundamentally golden hearted personality. Auli'i Cravalho is also pretty great as Moana herself, showing a surprising amount of talent in this field for someone her age, but her voice wasn't anything particularly special, making the big fuss about the search for her feel a little pointless and over-inflated. She sounds just like every other Disney heroine. The supporting cast is all great as well, including Temuera Morrison as Moana's father, Nichole Scherzinger as her mother (although I'm not sure she had more than a couple of lines?), Rachel House as her grandmother, Alan Tudyk's clucking and squawking as her chicken companion, and Jermaine Clement's shiny giant crab of the underworld (marking the second time in the last few days I have mistaken his voice for Jason Flemyngs).Moana is definitely a Disney movie, with high quality animation, song-work, and voice acting. It's story follows the usual formula with just a handful of twists and new approaches, supplanted to a unique and fairly unknown mythology. In the grand scheme of things, Moana isn't anything special. It will sink into the gloop of really well made Disney that fails to really stand out. I give it an enjoyable 7/10."
296,Moana,7,19 November 2016,Enjoyable! But it's way too Disney,"If there's such a crime for being too Disney, MOANA would be guilty of it. Now, before you attack me with torches and pitchforks, let me say that I enjoy this film, but in the traditional Disney animation sense, it really doesn't get more generic or more formulaic than MOANA.Directed by the team who gave us ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Hercules,"" and ""The Princess And The Frog,"" Ron Clements and John Musker this time take us to the islands of oceania, across the vast pacific where a teenager named Moana, wonderfully voiced by newcomer Auli'i Cravalho, dreams of voyaging across the open sea, just like her people's ancestors did. Her father however, the head chief, doesn't want that for his daughter, he wants her safe. But under the guidance of her late grandmother, Moana decides to venture off in order to find the demigod Maui, voiced by Dwayne Johnson, who years ago stole a certain object that would restore Moana's island that's being threatened by a curse. On this adventurous journey, Moana and Maui encounter obstacles along the way, find strength in each other's confidence and fulfill their destiny.I admit, a big part of why I was looking forward to this film is to listen to the new music, the original new songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa'i. And they did not disappoint us. All of the songs for this film should be nominated for Oscar, they're so lively, they fit the whole theme about legacy, and they're just extremely catchy, and the music sounds very islander too, I think if you're a cinephile or a Disney fan that comes from that part of the world, you'll immediately fall in love with the songs in MOANA, I guarantee it.As far as the characters and the story go, as I said earlier, MOANA is quite formulaic, I know some people might use the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' argument and to a certain extent, yes if it has worked in the past, then why change it. Obviously Ron Clements and John Musker are representative of Disney cinema, and they consistently take that with them from one movie to the next. So there's song and dancing, there's spiritual guidance, there's a sidekick pet, there's supernatural magical elements, and there's a giant arrogant but lovable friend and of course, our lead hero ultimately discovers his or her true identity. It's as if there's a specific equation that Clements and Musker always come back to and would never ever deviate from. I give MOANA a million credit for giving us Disney's first islander princess, we definitely needed one, you can always count me in for diversity. But if you've come to see a more original or a different kind of Disney movie, you'll have a better chance with 'Zootopia.' If you've come just for a good old fashioned Disney movie that's pretty safe and very familiar and fun for the whole family, then enjoy MOANA.-- Rama's Screen --"
297,Moana,8,6 December 2016,The Princess and the Sea,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A predictable but lively animated feature with superb visuals  that follow its winning formula all too safely.  GRADE: B  SYNOPSIS: A new Disney Princess arrives to tell her story of self  discovery.  JIM'S REVIEW: Moana, Disney's latest animated offering is more of the  same: lovely visuals, predictable but uplifting story, a peppy music  score, and a heroine you can certainly root for. The formula may be  winning, but, in all honesty, it is a little weary. Now, girl power is  a good thing...don't get me wrong...I just want a little more from this  creative studio. (My expectations are high from their track record.)  Still, this film is entertaining to the max, and the artistry and  creativity involved help to elevate this tale from standard family  fare.   Yes, the Disney Studio knows its way to success. It follows a set  formula that has worked for years: Introduce a modern day princess.  Check. Add feel-god vibes. Check. Bring in a comic sidekick. Check.  Show journey of self-discovery though impressive animation. Check. Mix  in a colorful villain or two. Check. Don't forget some catchy tunes.  Check. All leading to the ultimate happy ending. Well, what do you  think?  The screenplay, by Jared Bush, goes like this: A curse has befallen the  island of Motunui, and Moana, the chief's daughter, is determined to  rectify the ecological imbalance. So she sails off to find a demigod  named Maui to help her. Together they join forces to make the world a  better place. The script refuses to dumb down its plot, but it doesn't  stimulate the mind in its basic conventional set-up. The end result is  a purely visceral movie-going experience due to the high caliber of  artistic excellence on view.   Moana is a visual delight. The computer generated and hand drawn  animation mix well. The details are impressive: Water has a transparent  shimmer; colors glow with an iridescent radiance, varying textures from  sand to wood to leafy vegetation impress, the characters have an  expressive stylized purity. Particularly engaging are Maui's inky  hieroglyphic tattoos that spring to life to tell their own stories.  Special kudos go out to a terrific music score by Mark Mancina that has  the right percussion rhythms of the Polynesian culture and nifty  original songs with clever lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Opetaia  Foa'i that advance the plot.  Along with Dwayne Johnson as the Polynesian demigod, Auli'i Cravalho  voices Moana and they both do some wonderful vocal contributions to the  film. Providing fine vocal support too are Rachel House, Temuera  Morrison, and especially Jermaine Clement, who nearly steals the film  with his show-stopping production number, Shiny, (although the inspired  connection to The Little Mermaid is too obvious). There is also comic  relief in the form of a dim-witted rooster named Helhel, that younger  moviegoers will love.  Moana remains a well-crafted project, beautifully rendered and well  received by both critics and audience members. It is solidly directed  by Ron Clements and John Musker. But the predictability factor does  impair this South Pacific tale and all the wonderful surface treatment  and artistry could not hide its simplistic and familiar narrative. A  feeling of ""been there / done that"" does seep into the film's overall  impact. (In a year of glorious entries that brought forth such classic  works like Kubo and the Two Strings and Zootopia, also by the Disney  Studio, who couldn't ask for more of that perfect level of animation  and story?)  Wanting more daring innovation in my animated features is a worthy  goal. So I still look forward to the artisans at Disney Studio and  their next venture. The talent is there, in full force, but the Mouse  Factory needs to stop playing it so safely and find more challenging  projects. Stories that surprise and whet the intellect are not that far  a reach. Call me a cockeyed optimist.  NOTE: There was a tad bit of controversy of the depiction of Maui.  Disney Studios bulked him up from his more recognizable well-toned  physique and critics cried foul of this revamped stereotypical  reincarnation. There are bigger issues in life. Nuff said."
298,Moana,8,6 December 2016,A treat for the whole family.,"Infused with Hawaiian mythology, the latest animated flick from the Mouse House feels different despite being centred on the same girl-fulfils-heroic-destiny formula it has rolled out time and time again. Following the restless daughter of an island-bound Chieftain, this seafaring adventure is packed to the brim with goofy animal sidekicks, toe-tapping song and dance numbers, and the usual Disney charm. The whole movie is anchored by an endearing protagonist who earns a spot amongst Disney's more famous female characters thanks to her pluck and tomboyishness; there are no love interests or royal weddings for this independent woman. Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) doesn't do all the heavy lifting though, spending a large portion of the runtime with Maui (Dwayne Johnson  charismatic as ever), a hilariously egotistical demi-god who can shape shift and hurl insults. The chemistry between Moana and Maui is fantastic, their witty banter and odd couple clashing plays both for big laughsa sailing lesson with a paralysed Maui is downright hilariousand for touching moments. Not everything lands perfectly though, with Jemaine Clement's nefarious crab Tamatoa not quite landing, the sneering and sarcastic crustacean a little too reminiscent of Clement's diabolical cockatoo Nigel in the Rio series. The climactic showdown against a gigantic lava-throwing demon boasts some impressive visuals, however it also feels inessential coming off the back of what was otherwise a subtler affair. But the film works up so much goodwill elsewhere a few missteps can be easily forgiven. Disney delivers yet another family treat that can be enjoyed by those of all ages."
299,Moana,7,6 December 2016,"Gorgeous film, great actors but the songs weren't at all catchy or that good...","Like the past Disney films I've seen, they had catchy songs in them and are simply the best. Whereas with this film, it didn't have that touch with its musical numbers,they were kinda like songs you hear and then you forget about them. Although I have to admit they were quite flat, The Rock and Auli'i Cravalho are good singers, but I do think they were just given the wrong songs to sing away to. I would definitely show this to my kids in the future but I have to say, I am little disappointed with its musical numbers. Maybe if it was like the movie ""Brave"" without it being a musical, it would be a lot better. I hope when they do an another Disney princess movie, its musical numbers would be more organised,more fun and more upbeat. Thats why I have to give this movie rating a 7/10, it is fair but room for improvement............."
300,Moana,7,5 December 2016,"Five-Word Review: Exquisite, Enjoyable Fun; Somewhat Unoriginal","Moana continues the recovery Disney has enjoyed this decade. Hawaiian Auli'i Cravalho voices the titular not-a-princess, who sets off on a quest to find demigod Māui (Dwayne Johnson) and restore life to the islands and oceans of Polynesia.Moana has received a lot of critical acclaim for being fun, witty, and different, and overall it is pretty good. The voice work is stellar, with Johnson excelling at Māui's cocky bravura but also bringing depth to the role, and this should be a solid start for Cravalho. Jemaine Clement, however, steals the show, his unique voice instantly recognisable as a villainous and boastful crab.The music overall is simply wonderful. The influence of lyrical genius Lin-Manuel Miranda is clear, with some catchy and memorable songs, with stand-outs being Clement's and Johnson's songs. The very best thing is the animation, however - the best I've ever seen in a film. The water looks simply dazzling, surpassing anything seen in Finding Nemo/Dory. The final effect is an absolutely breath-taking aesthetic, and it's simply marvellous how much animation has progressed.It's also quite funny: at times self-referential (even too much in bits) and guaranteed to muster a chuckle. All in all it's quite a fun time and shows Disney reaching a scale close to that achieved by Pixar, even if it ultimately doesn't offer much new and maybe won't linger so long in the memory. 73/100"
301,Moana,8,2 December 2016,"Gorgeously designed, Tepidly Written","Moana captures all the best of Disney's classic formula. However, that formula is still a formula, which means it will lose some luster the more it's implemented. Moana's big, Broadway-esque songs fit the world perfectly, yet pale in comparison to the likes of Frozen or writer Miranda's Hamilton. It's funny, though not their funniest, too often relying on comedy tropes (anachronistic references, silly side characters). However, it's still worthy of Walt's vault because of its boisterous adventure, engaging characters, & unique themes. Moana is the heir-apparent-chief of her Polynesian tribe when the ocean chooses her to find a legendary demi-god, restore balance to the world and save her island. Through many plot contrivances and conveniences (hey, what do you expect? It's a Disney fantasy), Moana and her crew learn that there is more to this fable than they expected. While that story is formulaic, the characters are a blast. Johnson is perfect as Maui, and the chemistry between he and Moana is wonderful; like lovingly bickering siblings. Even the ubiquitous, dim-witted animal sidekick (chicken Heihei) was funny enough to tamper my cynicismor maybe my 3-year-old's endless laughter softened me. The real standout here is the animation. Spectacularly beautiful, the attention to little details like the movement of sand and water make the cool character designs and action sequences that much more involving. That aesthetic charm, mixed with tons of fun and a message that believing in others is just as vital as belief in ourselves, pushes this family-fantasy beyond its admitted clichés. Fans of Mickey's movies, specifically the ones of late, will find plenty to enjoy here."
302,Moana,8,28 November 2016,"It could have been better, but this is mainly nitpicking","So let's get this over with. I start with the many great points Moana had in it's entire movie. The plot was an exceptional one, not that it wasn't unpredictable but it was great nonetheless. I commend the start of the story for it's amazing narrative and songs and I love that 20 minutes or so of the movie most. It teared me up when Moana finally left the island what with the grandmother dying and all but it became more bitter-sweet when she reincarnated as the animal she chose. Then Moana goes on the search for Maui with Heihei as an unexpected companion (another pleasant plot twist). Then she was stuck in a storm and woke up on the island Maui was stuck on. She meets with Maui and he sings his introduction song which was okay. It's not great. Then he leaves her stranded on the island while she swims after him to no avail. Then the sea helps and they sorta talk. He's scared of Te Fiti's heart. Then the first monsters of the sea finds them and they clashed. I like this part of the movie as well. The visual was amazing! (Though I did question if that other movie with the mammoth and the sabre tooth tiger and the 2 sloths might raise some questions about that scene) Following that scene was Maui teaching Moana how to sail and they reached the island where they could reach Maui's fish hook. Tamatoa could have been a really great support character but instead we get that weird intro song that I just dislike with mighty passion! BUT more on that later. They got Maui's fish hook, he has an identity crisis (I probably forgot most of what happened next) and they reached Te Fiti's island which was guarded or surrounded by TeKa. Maui tells Moana to go, he fights Te Ka, loses,Moana tries to help but instead Maui's fish hook gets destroyed. They part ways. Then the sequence of her doubting herself, grandma comes to help, she finds herself again and she sails to Te Fiti again. This time she outsmarts Te Ka and manages to sail into the enclosure. Maui comes to help. Now at this point I love the movie again. She gets closer to the island at the cost of her boat and Maui sacrifices his demigod power so that Moana makes it to the island. Put the heart in the spiral, she was told but alas the island was no longer there. Te Fiti was just a silhouette in the sea. Turns out Te Ka was Te Fiti. Using her power as the sea's chosen one Moana parts the sea and put the heart stone back where it belonged. Te Ka changed back to Te Fiti, gifts Moana a boat and Maui a new fish hook and returns to her slumber. Moana part ways with Maui and went back home to Motunui where she awakens their explorer blood and the tribe sailed across the sea like they once did a thousand years before.Now that was the good part. I will start with what could be better. Song choice would be my first pick. Tamatoa's song was awful and I hate it. I still do. You gave him a villain like song but not make him stay throughout the whole movie. I think he had a potential as the anti-hero or just another unwilling sidekick who in the end was utterly surprised that TeKa was actually TeFiti all along. The lack of characters would be my second point. Most of the time, less is better but in Moana it did not serve the story so well. Maybe it's because I don't know much about polynesian lores but I believe that was lacking in the story.To compare with Frozen (it was the last Disney princess movie so bear with me), there many side characters who added colour to the plot. They weren't exactly important like the lodge-keeper atop the mountain or the many maids in the castle but they added something to the story. They added life. The same formula in Tangled as well. You don't expect people to remember everyone from the tavern but they were a fun addition to the movie. That is what Moana is lacking. There were so few characters that not much about the film's setting was not explored. They could have had Tamatoa following them around or had other demigods point them in their way, maybe some of Maui's friends? He can't be a total loner right? Or the ONLY demigod in Moana's entire universe, right? I'll educate myself on those lores later but I'm just saying some more side characters wouldn't hurt. It's because I can name most of the characters in the first viewing of the movie that I think the movie could use more characters. I seriously can name them all. It is a great idea to omit a male romantic counterpart for Moana but they should have added some side characters to the story.In conclusion, I am not dissing the movie, not all of it at least. As a matter of fact it was good...just not as good as Zootopia or Frozen.P/S: I like the theme that the calmest of beings could become the most ferocious of monsters."
303,Moana,7,14 December 2016,Over-rated! But the effort of people in the ~10 min credits does show off!,"Moana is a beautiful movie, never a slow pace moment but at the same time very formulaic to all Disney movies. Set in a place similar to where Lilo & stitch/Mulan stories happen, viewers are taken on a ride to another happy every after movie fairy tale. Would kids enjoy it, yes! Adults too? Yes but not everybody only because its another product of the formulaic process. And whats with making jokes on cross eyed animals, they did it in Finding Dory and now its the Chicken 'Hei Hei'! The scenes were genuinely funny but I kinda felt it unnecessary to make fun of disabilities, yes being cross eyed is a disability :/ The sound tracks are catchy, there is a short post credit scene and a couple of easter eggs...definitely a no brainer in watching it for some quality time."
304,Moana,8,10 December 2016,Will the animated film become a victim of its own success?,"The quality of some of the animation in Moana is phenomenal. We already know animated/CGI film has come on in leaps and bounds ever since Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) but in Moana it looks so real.If this continues, will animation and live-action film become indistinguishable? We have a little while left until or if that happens so can enjoy the vibrant, amusing fantasies that studios such as Disney continue to produce with what seems such easy excellence.The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, was the only man big enough in real-life to portray a (apparently) huge demigod but he is bested by the relatively unknown Hawaiian singer Auli'i Cravalho in the title tole."
305,Moana,7,10 December 2016,Moana - Review,"Moana - Review Year: 2016 Directors: Ron Clements and John MuskerGood work from Disney and the directors. I got exactly what I expected, an enjoyable movie with a massage to deliver. Something to take in count is that the movie is a musical too and we have songs here and there. The animation is insuperable, what can you expect from Disney, I remember being in the movie theater and wanted to pause the movie only to admire the backgrounds and the details in the animation, the movie is full of vivid colors and very good character designs. I need to remark the crab scene, a totally beautiful scene. The characters were all good and well developed but at a time I get annoyed by the rooster's jokes, I felt that the 90% of the jokes in this movie were physical, the ones that I don't like very much. It seems that they really caught the Polynesian culture in the movie, knowing well how they are, taking in count that they went there only to make this film. The music is very good, in some parts representing the Polynesian culture and in others the same but with a modern touch. The development of the movie is equal to the hero's path, where a noob has to set off on a journey or overcome an obstacle to become someone, a hero that is needed. The introduction is good, describing why the islands are dying and the journey begins. Get to know Maui, recover his hook and return Te Fiti's heart. The development of the movie is full of funny situations while they achieve their goals with a funny chemistry between Moana and Maui, despite we have seen this kind of relationship in Disney is always funny to watch how the characters deal with each other. One of the major problems that I have is that Moana did some incredible feats, like escaping from Maui's cave and returning to her boat from the pirates. I really liked the final act where she realizes that her ancestors used to navigate and discover new islands. At the end also they reveal that the lava monster is actually the goddess Te Fiti but when she appeared in the legend it was so fast from the time Maui stole the heart and the monster's appearance.Moana is a funny movie, very enjoyable to children and adults, the stronger points are the visual aspects, the music and the characters but is very simple, just that. A new heroin that needs no romantic interest, similar to Brave by Andrews and Chapman, with a mystical touch and always entertaining."
306,Moana,7,29 November 2016,The best Disney film I have seen in theaters since Frozen!,"This is probably the best movie released this year, though not the best Disney has put out in the last few years. I just hope it won't become the next Frozen because even though it wasn't as good as Frozen when it first came out, I'm worried that people might blow this up, saying, ""This is awesome!"" and giddy kids will be talking about it, wanting to revisit this many times and singing the songs.The movie starts off as Moana, a brave baby goes out to the ocean, where it makes friends with her. Though, her father is suspicious about her going out there due to him thinking it's too dangerous. Moana annoyingly persists in stubborness to go out to the ocean as she grows up.Moana hears from her mother that her father doesn't want her going out there because of how wild the waves can get. And she did admit that she went a little too far out in the ocean when she is forced to seek the demigod by her dying grandmother.The minor characters are pretty mediocre. They don't stand out much from your typical animations and films. They got sensitive small children. They got the typical Disney tropes, like the relationship between Gramma Tala and Moana where Moana encounters Gramma Tala, who cheers up Moana when she thinks that she's not right for the ocean. It's forgettable.Moana's voice actor may have sounded a bit too mature, it may have been the director's fault, but I don't know.I don't usually like musicals, and while the songs may have sounded rather forced, they were still lovely songs to hear.Overall, I came out the theater feeling happy. This was such an energetic, action-packed, fun movie unlike Zootopia, which is more slow in pace and thought-provoking. I thought that it was better than Zootopia and it wasn't as dramatic/emotional as Kubo and the Two Strings (a little-known movie). I do still like the film even though the minor characters weren't particularly lovable.I thought I wouldn't like this film because from the trailer, I thought it looked a little too weird, but it was actually creative in a good way."
307,Moana,10,18 November 2017,The hidden meaning,"The movie has amazing story, music and graphics. Though everyone in the reviews has appreciated the graphics and music most of them have failed to understand the story.Maui has been credited in the movie with raising islands, giving people coconuts, lengthening the duration of day. These events represent the physical phenomena that have taken place during the history of the earth, and the evolution of life too.In one review I read someone complaining that it does not make sense to wait on an island to correct a mistake done 1000 years ago, but the humans have been degrading, contaminating and destructing the land and the oceans for thousands of years and still have not left the island of their limited approach towards the environment.There is a lot that can be said about every little detail depicted in the movie but I wanted to highlight the hidden ideas conveyed through the story, that ""even a chicken plays a vital role in sustaining the life on the earth""."
308,Moana,10,15 November 2017,best movie EVER,"Loved the animations and Heyhey was so cute.Maui was funny and Moana reminds me of myself.The music was stunning.I don't think I know of a better movie.All in all, AWESOME."
309,Moana,6,13 November 2017,The story is nice and would make a good animated movie to watch for the weekends.,"""Moana"" animated Disney movie, could have been a great inspiring animation in all aspects, if they had changed one of the obstacles Moana faces during her journey. a bunch of pirate coconuts doesn't fit the great story which movie tells, making it looks like a kiddie one. speaking of gag, ""Hey Hey"" the stupid chicken rooster works fine. The other thing which doesn't really go with the whole concept and looks, is one of the main characters as Te Fiti itself. She looks more like a Marvel or DC comic characters not very localized based on story needs when represented as Lava monster. I'll give 10 out of 10 for great characterized of Maui and the grandma. The scenes where grandma shows the way and lay the foundation for the whole concept are outstanding..."
310,Moana,7,5 November 2017,Great Animation but lacks in story.,"First of all I was amazed to see the animation quality in the movie, its just stunning. Although movie is very entertaining, I think story could have been more unpredictable and engaging to the audience. But still its a great entertainer and everybody must watch it. Moana is a perfect movie for some holiday chilling."
311,Moana,9,29 October 2017,Moana takes two watches to fall in love with it.,"The only reason this movie is getting 9/10 and not 10/10 from me, is the simple fact that I didn't like the movie the first time I saw it. A lot of things about the movie bothered me that never did before. I thought there was too much singing, and it became very boring to keep hearing song after song. It wasn't something I was expecting and it put me off of the movie for quite a bit. About a month later, I tried to watch it again to see if after knowing what to expect I would like it better. I did. I was very pleasantry surprised by how much I loved it after that. The songs have become a fixture in my life. I love this movie now. All of the singing threw me off the first time, for not expecting it to be a musical like that. After I knew what it was, the second time was much more enjoyable. I encourage the people that didn't like it the first time, to try it out again."
312,Moana,10,29 October 2017,I like Moana,"The movie about young girl named Moana who wanna goes on the boat, but her won't let her goes beyond the reep, Tala as Her Grandmother gonna show her a cave with lots of old boats and tell her about Maul backstory. Tala gonna show Moana with ocean have been chose her and show her a heart of Te Fiti and on it way to find Maul. Moana find him and on it way to Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters to his hook back and to the boat and head back to her island home to save the world and reach Te Fiti to restore the heart.Moana is the Best animated film of all time ever starring the film as Nani Pelekai (""Lilo and Stitch"") and Hercules.Auli'i Cravalho is did great job for playing the voice of Moana. Dwayne Johnson did awesome job playing the voice of Maul"
313,Moana,7,29 October 2017,A cute movie,"This was just meant to be a nice and fun movie, and it does that perfectly. Even if this isn't one of my favorite movies, it does a great job drawing you into it and letting you have fun for two hours. And it doesn't even feel like two hours since there are so many things that happen. The film really does go on and let it delve into the best potential that it possibly could be able to ever go into. I feel like this is the best that it could have been. Despite Dwayne Johnson not being all that great of a singer obviously, he just gives it his all. And the girl who plays Moana for being only 16 years old at the time does a good job and off to the side, I will admit it is strange to see people younger than me acting and being in these professional careers. But that is just something that I want to say to the side. But I also like a lot of the songs on here since they are just nice and fun, like most of the rest of this movie should have been and exactly was."
314,Moana,3,28 October 2017,Why do people like this movie so much?,"I DO NOT understand the hype around this movie. With so many good Disney movies out there, even relatively modern ones like Tangled and The Emperors New Groove, I don't understand why anyone would watch this movie. It's utterly predictable and stars a pretentious, spoiled brat of a princess who is incapable of doing anything on her own. Here are my problems with this movie. 1. Moana does absolutely nothing on her own!Whether from Maui the super special Demigod, her dead grandmother in the form of a sparkly spirit sting ray, or the ocean itself, help always seems to come for Moana. She cannot do anything on her own. She can't sail her own boat without the help of the magical ocean or Maui. I'm still not sure why she was chosen in the first place. Aside from a very naive and misguided sense of optimism, she possesses no real positive qualities, and she never would have succeeded without the help of the aforementioned parties. 2. Why is no one talking about the coconuts??Can someone please explain to me why no one is concerned or confused that they are actually attacked by an angry army of sentient coconuts? No explanation. No warning. No sense. Just an army of coconuts that almost manage to vanquish our heroic team, despite the fact that they are so stupid that at one point, one of them actually shoots his own leader with a blow dart. But we shouldn't be surprised. They are, after all, coconuts. And if moana is so incredible, she should have been able to defeat them much easier. Not to mention the fact that this is really just a terrible writing choice for Disney. This whole scene could have been cut out and it wouldn't have changed the movie at all. It wouldn't make a whole lot more sense, but at least you could say that no one was attacked by coconuts. 3. Let's talk about that ending. Disney is not known for flawless endings. But this one made no sense. First of all, you've got a lava monster living in the middle of the ocean, because the laws of chemistry mean nothing to Disney. But then Moana just walks right out and sings it into submission, calming down the volcanic anger of the scary monster with the soothing touch from her pretty princess hand. The idea of the lava monster being the dying island was completely predictable, but they could have come up with a more logical way to return the heart. 4. Why does this disease move so slowly?It's been 1000 years since Maui stole the heart, right? But judging by how quickly the blackness was chasing Maui when he first stole it, it should have reached Moana's island much sooner. 5. Her sidekicks are awful. I'm not going to try to tell you that Flounder and Pascal are the brightest crayons in the box, but this chicken is downright stupid. And it's not even funny. He's trying to eat a rock. Repeatedly. No creature could possibly be that stupid and live longer than 12 seconds. He is absolutely moronic and she should have let Maui eat him. And the pig isn't much better. 6. Her father is quite possibly the worst chief on the planet. He's afraid of the water. He lost his friend. Fine. But his people are literally starving. How can he possibly justify not allowing his fishermen, who are presumably much smarter and more experienced than he was at the time of his tragic accident, to go out and find food for his people? Then he stifles his daughter's creativity and curiosity because of his own fears. He's a terrible father and a terrible chief and he needs to be dethroned. And also, if he's so afraid, how does his daughter know how to swim? All in all, this movie is absolutely atrocious. The writing makes no sense. The plot is lazy and predictable. Moana, though regarded as revolutionary and self reliant, is very much the same as every other princess to ever appear in a Disney movie. The only difference is her very misplaced optimism and utter lack of talent. Oh, and by the way, that crab is creepy. I'm sorry."
315,Moana,9,22 September 2017,very beautiful movie,A very beautiful movie. It passes very beautiful messages. good enough scenario. I have seen it at least 5 times. is one of the films that will stay in the history of cinema. from the beginning to the end does not let you take your eyes off the screen. I attach it irresistibly to all children but also adults.
316,Moana,9,2 September 2017,Great movie,"This is a really exciting movie to watch. I was captivated the whole time. For me, Moana is very relatable as I too am at a stage in life where I'm taking a huge leap of faith in myself. It motivates me to go forward and think about how far I can go. A truly inspirational movie. The songs are really good too."
317,Moana,7,1 September 2017,Moana  A Good Slice of Disney Cheese,"2016 was a busy year for animated films hitting the box office and big screens, with hit movies such as 'Zootopia' and 'Kubo & The Two Strings' being ever prevalent as some of the most popular films to debut that year - It's no surprise to me that 'Moana' followed the same musical legacy that Walt Disney studios like to traditionally strive for.Disney's 'Moana' follows the events after demigod Maui (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) steals the heart of the goddess Te Fiti, plunging the island into a watery abyss. As Muai escapes the sinking island, he is soon confronted by the Lava Monster (Te Kā), a heartless and destructive creature with a fiery disposition. Maui is defeated in battle and sinks further into the depths, becoming but a memory to the humans or a children's bedtime story. With the threat of growing darkness making its way over the Polynesian coast; Moana, a young girl caught in personal conflict between her love of her village she is destined to lead and dreams of sailing the waters beyond the reef, must find the courage to find the lost demigod and restore order to the land. While the film itself lacks the many intricate details that movies such as 'Zootopia' included, Moana is the traditional bit of cheese that gives Walt Disney it's popular family image, with a wide range of musical numbers that provide enjoyment like their previous counterparts. In no way was it shocking that I found myself humming out the tune of ""You're Welcome"" performed by Dwayne Johnson as Lin- Manuel Miranda manages to bring a vibrant culture into a soundtrack that's accessible for all ages. They're easy to listen to, an absolute pleasure to play on repeat and manage to remain relevant to their purpose. The animation is on point throughout the movie, equalling the same amount of intricate programming as the two previous films mentioned  all the while keeping the same, alluring charm that Disney continues to nail. One thing that Disney manages to do without fail is their choice in voice actors: Dwayne Johnson seems to completely blend in with Maui's egotistical and fun-loving image, yet still remain comfortable enough with his voice to sing a musical number. Auli'i Carvalho definitely manages to hold her own sense of individuality against the star, giving a strong voice to a very modern and highly driven female character. Moana proves that you are always capable of creating a female character that doesn't depend on the validation of a male counterpart or even a shoehorned romantic sub-plot. It was a highly refreshing character to see after 'Frozen' pushed Disney back to the same outdated representation of naive girls risking everything for love. Overall, Moana did not fail to disappoint me. It's above the expectations of 'Frozen' and more on the level of enjoyment that 'Tangled' provided young girls when it first debuted. For families, it is an adventure of self-discovery and confidence that will definitely bring a smile to your face. Great music, an okay-ish story and an idiotic chicken. Need I say more?"
318,Moana,10,28 August 2017,You know who you are.,"The chief's daughter Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) must restore order to the world by returning the lost/stolen heart stone to the goddess. She is aided by demi-god Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and a dumb chicken.This is a delightful Disney film about a young girl discovering who she is and being strong and determined. She is the daughter of the chief, but doesn't like the title ""princess"" a self poke on Disney whose marketing centers around princess dolls and films. Even though the film is aimed at kids, I had a few good laughs. Auli'i Cravalho is quite the singer."
319,Moana,10,27 August 2017,Well well well,What can i say about moana sat down and watched it with my daughter and after said and done 10 out of 10 what more do you want in a animation other than the dwayne the rock johnson singing his heart out overall story pretty good as well but i was surprised with the peoples champ singing maybe before wwe he could of sold out arenas so if you haven't seen it go do it now
320,Moana,9,25 August 2017,"Jaw dropping music, surprisingly uplifting, lush animation!","This movie restored my tolerance of the Disney formula. I'm more of a Lynch and Kubrick type. Perhaps I was just at a point in my life where the skeptic in me softened. Yes, that animation of baby Moana is pure emotional blackmail. Yes, there is the rebellion against the patriarchal figure that I get tired of seeing in just about every modern American film. But Moana is undeniable. The music is so uplifting, so different, and one of very few soundtracks to which I can listen and marvel a bit. Unlike other animation films featuring princesses of color, this one didn't feel politically compulsory. It wasn't ""corporate has decided that we need to make a movie with a brown princess to be politically correct"" it was, ""look at these interesting people in this interesting place and see how different yet how beautiful they are and in no way need to be like us""...maybe we don't all need to have skinny noses and bodies with big butts (or whatever the trend is). Visually stunning, emotionally touching in unexpected ways, with each character adding soul, light, or comedic relief as needed. The grandma reminded me of my mom who died last year and this movie gave me a way of explaining her passing to my son in a way that helped him. I will say the pop artists covering the original songs is a bit annoying, but that comes at the credits. I perceive Duane Johnson as a fairly respectable actor now, not just a pretty muscle man who scowls. There is so much about this film to look forward to that has not been done before, nor quite like this. I have seen it at least 3 times."
321,Moana,8,16 August 2017,A nice addition to Disney's 3D animated film library,"Moana is a CGI musical animated film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. Featuring the voices of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Temuera Morrison, and newcomer Auli'i Cravalho, it is a nice addition to Disney's 3D animated film library and a fun journey of self-discovery.On the small Polynesian island of Motunui, Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), the daughter and heir of the island's chief, lives in harmony with her fellow inhabitants. One day, Motunui is struck by a terrible curse brought on by the Demigod Maui (voiced by Dwayne The Rock Johnson), which causes food and vegetation to become scarce. Determined to fix this, Moana departs from the island to search for Maui to help her in accomplishing this task.Despite containing some of the typical Disney tropes and clichés, Moana manages to feel fresh and vibrant, thanks in part to its huge heart and likable charm. I particularly enjoyed the nice blend of the Polynesian culture, which includes those of Samoa, Hawaii, and New Zealand. The film is very beautiful to look at and the visuals can be stunning at times. The songs, in particular, ""You're Welcome"", are catchy and compliment the film quite well, and never feel annoying or as if they were written specifically to win awards, unlike a certain song from another Disney film about letting go. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is amusing as Maui and he certainly projects enough of his good-naturedness into the role. However, it is newcomer Auli'i Cravalho who stands out the most, mainly due to how well written her character happens to be.I rate it 8/10"
322,Moana,8,12 August 2017,Single-Best Modern Disney Princess Movie,"Moana is a movie reminiscent of the classic Disney formula, yet the masterful manipulation of music, visual, and story render a much more powerful narrative. Imagine a Disney princess story mixed with the musical achievement of Elton John in the Lion King (1994) (in this case Lin-Manuel Miranda) to achieve a film of masterful rendition equal to the likes of a Broadway musical or La La Land (2016).The piece is defined by the music, yet still delivers strongly with its plot. Expecting the typical chemistry of the Disney formula, we get a carefully calculated divergence from the recipe. However, instead of the confused ramblings of Frozen (2014), Moana takes the high road, turning Disney magic combined with the traditional musical style to create a wonderful new addition to the Disney princess catalog. Moana, the character, takes the adventurous personality of Ariel and the cautious courage of Simba. Finally, in the climax, every aspect of the film comes together in a beautiful point of parallelism and self-realization, making Moana an instant classic and the best traditional Disney installment since the turning of the new century.However, the creators fumble by mixing up musical craft with the catchy songs designed for kids. There is but one misplaced song that is merely there to catch the essence of the ""Disney magic"". Additionally, what is a divergence from the traditional formula also adheres too much. Playing on the simple pathos and sympathy found all too often in kids movies and romantic facades, the film utilizes cliché rather than creativity to create conflict in a pivotal moment, unfortunately, reducing the impact of the plot.Nevertheless, Moana is the single-best modern Disney princess movie, contending with the classics, but falters at moments."
323,Moana,7,31 July 2017,Solid Disney Movie,"This was a fun upbeat story with nicely developed characters. I enjoyed Dwayne Johnson's performance, but I thought the ending was a little abrupt in terms of how the conflict was resolved. Also I realized the song How Far I'll Go that I hear on the radio is sang by Alessia Cara not the actress in Moana and I actually like the remake better than the original. Overall I think Moana is definitely worth seeing."
324,Moana,6,27 July 2017,About what you'd expect from Disney,"I appreciated the female power aspect and Polynesian representation that the movie offered, but some particular plot developments (namely the Kakamora, which I felt were trying to bank on the Minions' success) and character decisions (Maui choosing to fight against the Kakamora to save the heart, even though he was deathly afraid of it about two minutes prior) pretty much ruined the movie for me. The animation was impressive, and the voice acting and music were good as well, but the story and characters didn't do much for me.Art: 10 Story: 5 Sound: 9 Characters: 5 Enjoyment: 4Overall: 6"
325,Moana,7,4 July 2017,A beautiful and fun delight but not a masterpiece by any means,"Disney's Moana is a fun treat its with breathtaking animation, funny and interesting characters, and classic Disney-style musical sequences, but suffers due to a somewhat cookie-cutter story and a seemingly lack of overall stakes or consequence. All in all, Moana is another fun adventure from Disney studios that will entertain audiences of any age or background, but is far from the classics of old."
326,Moana,7,29 June 2017,"Beautiful in every sense, Moana will soften even the hardest of hearts","Moana is not the most original Disney movie. It's not a wildly different experience like Zootopia, and it's not as subversive to the Disney tropes as Frozen was. It has a lot of the same tropes you see in any Disney movie, and in a lot of ways it's one of the most pure Disney movies, tropes and all, that's come out in a while. It doesn't have a romance which is definitely a refreshing take, but other than that we've definitely seen a lot of this before. But here's the thing, even though it's full of tropes, they're all tropes I love, and it's able to use these tropes in an original environment with characters I really loved.And Moana was a fun animation that set us out on adventures! It brought forth excitement with her never give up attitude. The computer aided animation was great. It is a wonderful children's animation. Good music, great story, and great adventure. It brought life to the Hawaiian mythology and gave me a subject to learn about. Making for another successful animated film by Disney. ----From Yidioo"
327,Moana,6,26 June 2017,Basic but good,"Even though I am a big fan of animated movies which sometimes can have better, more emotional and better concepted story then a normal movie, Moana's plot is far from what I expected.I am so sorry it gone so wrong but as a movie was going I stared to realize how many stupid ideas it has. 'A God' who depends on his creations, keeps his vital life on open and suddenly turns out to be so evil and bad... To me it really meant a disaster for a story. Then that common scenes, dialogues, even whole parts of a movie were so worn out and boring.Female protagonist, strong and independent young woman, brave and consistent... I liked that. That is something we need today. Someone who will show our kinds, especially girl how much they need to believe in themselves. I liked a hero who was actually a disguised villain. Maui was also a character I liked a lot. Movie made me laugh and that is always respectable by me. And grandma... you are my biggest hero from among them all.I didn't like those musical parts for anything and everything due to which I was almost irritated and annoyed later on. There was just too many of them.But after all this is one pretty decent movie with good small parts and a bit bad and usual story."
328,Moana,8,25 June 2017,It's In the Telling,"This is a very well done animated feature, using Samoan culture and mythology. At some point there was an upheaval when a demi-god stole a heart, a green gem that needs to be returned properly to put an end to evil. A Samoan princess is enlisted by the ocean to go on a quest to return things to the way they were. She is forced into acting against her father's wishes, going beyond the limits he has placed on her. Of course, there are no surprises in the plot. We can parse this out without any trouble. The stars of this show are the special effects, the music, and some very interesting characters. But it doesn't offer a lot of new plot developments. If we see enough Disney films, we could line up the characters that seem to appear in just about everyone. Moana is a firecracker, but her endless talk and advice gets a little old. The best characters in the film are the Ocean (yes, the Ocean) and a hilarious walleyed chicken. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it, but I didn't find much new ground."
329,Moana,9,23 June 2017,"It is a whimsical, crowd-pleasing Disney-animated adventure for the whole family","Ron Clements and Don Hall, the creators of Disney animated entries such as the video-game-plotted 'Wreck-It-Ralph', the musical- esque 'Frozen', and the recent hit 'Zootopia' have returned and have cooked up yet another thrillingly fresh adventure that is destined to appeal to both children and adults. Moana is a charm-filled picture that swarms just about everything it needs to be a superbly entertaining hit. It moves with moments of laughter, moments of charm, and even moments of sentiment. And much like recent endeavors such as 'Frozen', there is some singing. If there is even a slight shortcoming to this animated picture, it may be for being overly nostalgic to the classic Disney animated picture from the 1990s and early 2000s when the studios were at their hay days. However, this shortcoming may undoubtedly serve as a plus for those (particularly teens) reminiscent about the old days of Disney cartoons. Either way, this film falls nothing short of an astonishment to say the least. This film follows titular character Moana (voiced by Auli'l Cravalho), a young Polynesian girl who lives on island run by her overprotective father Chief Tui (played by Temuera Morrison). When the island crops begin dying and their food supply begins depleting, Moana, against her father's wishes, sets out across the sea in search of a demigod named Maui (voiced by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) who is in possession of a green stone capable of restoring the island's crops and bringing peace to her home. Together, the two journey across the sea in an adventure while fighting against the mysterious creatures that stand in their way.Disney Animation Studios has been no stranger delivering the goods when it comes to family-oriented entertainment, even when some of their entries slip into the category of forgettable. However, it is rare that many animated features come as glossy as this one in both the technical and narrative department. Glowing with powerfully dazzling animation including the photorealistic water, which happens to operate as a minor character throughout the story, this film represents the astounding progress of how far Hollywood has journeyed in computer animation. The animation is virtually flawless and hard not to look at. But the real icing on the cake is the story, which takes place mostly on a boat in the middle of the ocean, and execution. Following the eponymous character on an adventure to not only save her precious home but to discover her true self, this movie sparkles with surprises from beginning to end. There is kind- hearted humor to appeal to both kids and adults, and the voice performances are nothing short of spectacular. Auli'l Cravalho and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson who handle the voices of Moana and Maui respectively shine in their roles, particularly during the musical numbers which allow the actor and actress exercise their singing muscles. If you were one of those people who developed the vexing earworm from songs like 'Let It Go' or 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman', no need to worry! These songs manage to be fun and whimsical to listen to without feeling like to a chore to listen to over and over again. While the aforementioned musical singles from 'Frozen' were not necessarily bad songs, their reputations were greatly tarnished for those who were forced to listen to their friends or family members sing them or play them on the radio constantly. Then there is Alan Tudyk doing the voice of Heihei, a stowaway rooster who's dialogue is greatly confined to a series of squawks and chirps. Overall, there is absolutely nothing in the way of children having a fun time during the picture, except maybe the lava monsters which may just a little scary for the youngsters.Moana is a crowd-pleasing Disney-animated adventure that is bound to fill both kids and parents with delight and satisfaction. Among many of Disney's recent entries, whether or not this one manages to stand out is somewhat debatable. Nonetheless, this movie makes an irresistible, if familiar experience."
330,Moana,,19 June 2017,Once again solid effort from Disney,"With Moana Disney returns to its princess formula, albeit with a more adventurous plot and a noticeable lack of romance. Which is a good thing. Disney has tried to re-examine its own traditions ever since The Princess and the Frog, and this movie is a logical continuation of that. And it's still perfectly recognizable as Disney. It's about going on an adventure, finding yourself, believing in yourself, all that good stuff.It's also the best-looking film Disney has yet made. And that's saying something. The water effects utilized in this film are jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Someone joked that it would have been easier for Disney to go out and film real Polynesian waters. Because it looks so good I'm not convinced they didn't do just that. The rest of the textures, designs and visuals overall are almost equally as pleasing and it's simply a joy to watch.Also full props to the two leading voice actors and their characters in general. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson continues to prove that he's one of the most likable persons on Earth, but the true star of this film has to be Auli'i Cravalho as Moana in her first ever film role. Her sheer singing talents would have made the character one of the best Disney heroines ever, but it's more than that. It's the will of the character, the passion mixed with fear of the unknown, tempered by fierce will to protect her people. And all this wrapped inside compassion and goodwill. Auli'i easily made Moana one of my all-time favourite Disney characters.Probably the only real complaint I have about the film is the story. Because while it's perfectly fine, it could have been better. At times you get this nasty feeling like you're being manipulated. Like certain scenes are there just because it's a Disney film, not because the film itself needs them. The film also makes fun of Disney's own clichés a bit too mean-spiritedly in my opinion.That being said, the ending is fantastic. One of the best I've ever seen. And that's because it's not a big action scene or a showstopper. Rather the scene that saves the day is intimate, quieter, something that fits Moana's character perfectly.Moana is a great film. It's not perfect and personally I do like Frozen and Zootopia better, but it's still head and shoulder above its competition and a proud mark for Disney once again."
331,Moana,9,16 June 2017,A Beautiful World Of Magic,"""Moana"" is another animated classic by Disney Studios. The images are beautiful, including some depictions of nighttime and low light conditions that are amazing. The visuals are paired with some wonderfully stirring tribal music.The story is about a quest. Moana is the heroine who pursues her dreams and her mission and, of course, finds personal fulfillment and growth as well. Played by Auli'i Cravalho, it is difficult to imagine anyone better suited to the role. Dwyane Johnson plays Maui, her reluctant helper, a demigod.From the start, the film is revealed as a mythological story. It is based on traditional Polynesian stories of creation and general principles of nature worship. The artists at Disney created a magical world of beauty and imagination that is only rivalled by ""Avatar""."
332,Moana,9,9 June 2017,Good Disney Entertainment,"Actually it's 8.5 rounded up to 9. Beautiful breathtaking animation with a good Disney formula story. A pleasant enough songbook but not every song is a ""stunner"". Many Easter Eggs and Disney references throughout. (""If you wear a skirt and have a sidekick, you're a (Disney) princess"".) (""You're not going to break into song again, are you?"") Antagonistic villains include war-like Pirate Coconuts that act like Ewoks and magically multiply. A rather pompous giant crab that likes shiny things. Major Spoiler: A fire breathing monster that ""morphs"" back into the Green Goddess of prosperity and happiness and restores the islands after a thousand years. Maui (the Demi-God) acts a lot like a very-large-in- charge ""Elvis"". He is a shapeshifter which comes in handy for fighting all the ""baddies"". ""Moana"" does impossible stunts and dives and that's what fantasy animation is all about! All characters are treated with respect and there's no stereotypical nonsense, except for the chicken. I'm sure that the Polynesian ""Gods"" will upset a church or two. It's fun-to-watch and almost kept the attention of my two-and-a-half-year-old Granddaughter. Not even ""Frozen"" could do that! A bit too long for an animated feature but most enjoyable. The song that gets stuck in your head after the initial trance-like-state Disney Magic induces, is ""You're Welcome"". Even though the story is a bit far-fetched and rather silly, who cares?"
333,Moana,8,31 May 2017,Steve's Film Page on Facebook,"Textbook Disney. A tried and true formula that stands the test of time. What more can we expect from Disney legends like Clements and Musker? Apparently, a lot! The visual effects, from the hand-drawn animation to the stunning CGI, blew me away. These directors had minimal experience dealing with CGI films but, with Moana, they dominated animation in 2016, over fantastic films like Finding Dory and Zootopia. The voice cast was also excellent. Dwayne Johnson, in particular, should devote more time to voice acting, because he was incredible. I also always appreciate nods in animation to great live-action films, like Fury Road. The soundtrack was better than I could have imagined. Lin-Manuel Miranda's writing stole the show enough for me to research more of his music. Finally, Disney has never shied away from strong female protagonists, but Moana takes it even further. They morally dumbed down Maui so Moana could shine more, but she shines bright anyway. A completely three-dimensional Polynesian princess that doesn't need a Disney prince to complete her story. Disney has always been at the forefront of returning women to the central roles they deserve in film. A company that's not scared to tackle the depths of the better sex. I do have my problems with the film, and they are very much as textbook as the positives, but I enjoyed what I saw. And that chicken, though. Top 500 film. 8/10  ￼watching Moana."
334,Moana,9,30 May 2017,One of those movies that leaves you in a wonderful mood!,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing this movie ended up being! We found it to be very funny, heartfelt, and a perfect family movie. Being an adult in his thirties, I found myself laughing often and feeling a variety of emotions that were felt long after the movie ended. Although my son fell asleep during the flick, I cannot fault the movie as he is only 21 months old. I did purchase the movie however as it has become a Disney classic in the eyes of this family!"
335,Moana,9,25 May 2017,Good story!,"I loved this movie, it was very Original. I like almost every Disney move though this is one of my favorites. The characters are so different from each other. Great story line, great characters, lots of funny stuff but also emotional stuff. And there's a really nice plot twist in the movies. go watch it if u haven't already Note: the songs are terrible in dutch"
336,Moana,8,22 May 2017,b movie,"Moana will be the next chief of her clan, but her heart belongs to the ocean, so she sets on sail to find the demigod Maul so they can return the heart to Te Fiti.The story sets in a wonderful magical place full with songs and comedy funny scenes and lines. Voices both Dwayne Johnson and Auli'i Cravalho were amazing in their songs and voices. Songs were amazing. Directing was good in the film."
337,Moana,8,14 May 2017,Great Disney movie with excellent animation,"Great Disney movie! Excellent animation, although they get carried away a bit with the Te Ka monster. The first act is a bit slow but picks up when Moana, Maui and HeiHei (the chicken) set off to sea.The voice case is excellent, with newcomer and Hawaiian-native Auli'i Cravalho as Moana, Dwayne Johnson as Maui, and Alan Tudyk (Wash in ""Firefly"") as HeiHeiThe songs range from innocuous to inspired, with ""You're Welcome,"" sung by Dwayne Johnson, being the best.See it now if you like Disney films."
338,Moana,8,13 May 2017,Beautiful and expressive with lush visuals and great music.,"One of the better Disney classics I have seen in some time. Maybe a bit much for kids under 7, but it has a lot of appeal for most ages from preteen girls to grown men like myself! The characters have a lot personality and their expressive faces are really amazing. The score and songs are surprisingly catchy. What really stood out for me is the gorgeous ocean (which plays a central character), in all of its colors and moods. Idyllic beaches, clear aquamarine lagoons, Starry skies, violent waves, lightning storms and stunning luminescent scenes abound. There is an underlying mother earth wisdom which tries to surface while teaching us about early pacific culture, mythology and their history as ocean voyagers. The main character Moana is equally wonderful as a curious toddler (utterly cute), and as the young heroin who musters the courage to carry on the destiny of her ancestors. Her Demi-God sidekick Maui is also a great character. I have had a lot of reservations with some of Disney's more recent productions, as they tend to be more trendy and less traditional, but this one manages to have progressive sensibilities while maintaining that high standard we expect."
339,Moana,8,21 April 2017,"Great, but not Disney's best","I loved this film and I think it's a great family movie. The music is good but the singing has been better in the past, the animation is really good, but it continues to make regular progress and the story is entertaining, but nothing new. What I most enjoyed was the challenging character, how it faces Disney history and ""tradition"" saying 'we have evolved', and I think it's great to see how the film-makers keep up with the times. I would love to see more films in the future featuring a male main character, like Big Hero 6. Still, I thoroughly recommend it."
340,Moana,7,2 April 2017,An average Animation,"In a world where a demi-god has stolen the heart of a goddess in an attempt to make good deeds but has triggered a huge wave of death, Moana, the daughter of the chieftain of her kind, dreams of becoming an explorer, instead of taking her father's place. Thus, when she finds out an important information about her people's past, she decides to run away into the ocean with her animal companions.Although it looks simply stunning as many animations from the last years, it fails to impress in almost every other way. The plot is mediocre, linear and predictable, the characters are poorly described and thought, tending to become even annoying from time to time, while the action is also disappointing, in a way in which almost nothing interesting happens. They attempted to make it a comedy so the movie is filled with jokes, sarcasm and humor, but all in all, it doesn't manage to actually make you laugh. It's almost like they tried too hard, but what they've actually done is to ruin the severity of the intrigue and focus on other least important factors. The one thing that is really funny is her retarded chicken companion. To point the upsides, it has flawless animation, some good singing and a bit of suspense now and then. They make it an average movie overall, missing a good opportunity to create something unique or at least something that will make you laugh like never before."
341,Moana,7,31 March 2017,One Word: Fun,"Fun movie. Looks gorgeous, catchy music, and some actually solid character development and dare I say, a bit of heart and creative passion.The story here at least when it comes to the bullet points is nothing new. You have your girl who doesn't fit in with her surroundings, you have her annoying side kick, and you have an outcast seeking redemption. Together they go on an adventure to save the world.But unlike similar films that garnered more success but are honestly much worse movies, like Frozen, this rather clichéd story is elevated by the performances. Moana has a ton more depth than the fish-out-of-water Anna. This is mostly because she is given more screen time as a child, learning from her parents and her people. You are given a much more clear picture of who this person is, how she was raised, and her conflicting emotions about her own people and her lust for adventure, whereas Anna... likes her sister and snowmen. Speaking of:Moana's main personal track, How Far I'll Go, is a way more palatable song after multiple listens than Anna's Do You Want to Build a Snowman. You can actually listen to How Far I'll Go at anytime and it'll be an enjoyable listen, whereas it's counterpart only makes sense in the movie itself. The Rock proves again that he's real star here and is such a more fun and interesting a counterpart than Kristoff. Again, this is due to depth. Kristoff is a begrudging tag-along and not much else. Personality wise, he's rather blank. Maui on the other hand, is vibrant and full of charisma, and once his tragic backstory becomes unveiled, he becomes an infinitely deeper and more likable character than one would expect from a modern Disney movie. And You're Welcome is a very fun track.Also unlike the insufferable Olaf, the annoying sidekick in this film (a mentally challenged chicken), is only around for the occasional sight gag, rather than making terrible jokes and singing terrible songs with it's terrible voice terribly.I'm not trying to rag on Frozen too harshly here. I'm only using it to illustrate my point that Moana is a similar movie done far better.I don't like to give too much away in terms of plot, so I'll close this review by saying that this movie is by no means perfect. It's certainly not a movie you haven't seen before, but the catchy music, the enjoyable characters and relationships that actually grow and develop, and the sense of adventure alongside absolutely stunning visuals make this a movie that most won't regret watching."
342,Moana,7,20 March 2017,"A must watch, but must not necessarily appreciate.","It's a good movie. The songs are great, better than most Disney films I dare say. There were amazing animations, especially the lightning. The story itself is quite original and inspired, but the movie was too short for good character development. Most of them made me feel like they overreact easily. Also, They cheated on explaining a plausible story with that self-conscious water, it was cheap. Lots of scenes were too fast, couldn't they lengthen it to 130 minutes instead of 107? Beside that, and the subjective likeness of each of us, anyone can appreciate that movie."
343,Moana,8,13 March 2017,first of all,"how old is this Moana supposed to be anyway? he called her an eight year old and it baffled me.ah also where the pig at ???? he's a main character my stud, bring the tiny guy in more often.otherwise, it's a pretty neat movie"
344,Moana,6,12 March 2017,Musical is like Britney Spears gone Emo,"Good animation, Good theme, Good characters. Music was low effort from Disney, Enrique Iglesias and Britney Spears gone Emo, backed by swashbuckling orchestral sounds with the merest hint of melody, rhythm, chords, humor, singalong potential, and calm. The songs accompany visuals of huge grimacing faces, spiraling - roller coaster camera movements, which only a kid raised up on stroboscopic cartoons can watch contentedly (in a state of zapped stupor), and Soothing like an air raid siren of emotional turmoil/crisis, which is about 2 notes off key all the time. No dance routines, No choreography, No group chorus at all, no chords, no grooves, no fun rhythms. None of the songs was actually a song, because there were no instrumental partitions. The vocalists were good but they were expected to do only one style of music, with no room for musical instruments and accompaniment. Family music is simple to write, popular and fun to listen to. Great musicals have good theme tunes. Its a shame to apply so much low quality score to such an awesome animation. Little mermaid songs were much better, more consonant, less shouted and confused. Snow White would sing in a motherly tone: maternal and paternal songs. These are commercial emo-trash songs which would rattle little ear drums without nourishing with proper emotional/educational value. The children wont go home infused with musical ire. They will be rattled, emotional, emboldened and discordant. One or two songs were 6/10.most were 2/10.Worth 10/10, with 2/10 for the low composer values. The songwriting was fine."
345,Moana,7,4 March 2017,"Overall, not the best, not the worst, but a great time","An amazing movie, I loved it, though it's is certainly one of the weeks out of the past couple of years. The music is amazing but I didn't think that there was enough of it. The villain is extremely forgettable but I love the other characters. Lin Manuel Miranda really outdid himself this time. I know that I'll be humming the songs for months to come."
346,Moana,7,25 February 2017,Fine Family Film,"I enjoyed this movie and will certainly watch it back from time to time. I may even end up owning it. But it is the first animated Disney movie since Tangled I haven't been in a hurry to watch back. The only sequence that I enjoyed on the same level was the crab, with his song ""Shiny."" It may be my favorite Disney song since I was a child. But I can't tell you any specific problems with this film. It may be the best looking animated film ever made, as the ocean and island scenery was spectacular. It just didn't capture my imagination the way Big Hero 6 or Wreck It Ralph did. There characters were memorable and well designed, and I was excited to hear it was going to have a Polynesian setting. But somewhere the story was just lacking. It didn't feel as well developed as the other recent films, almost like it went into production without the extra revisions it needed. Even so, I expect it will be loved by generations of viewers, so I'll give it a 7 out of 10."
347,Moana,7,24 February 2017,Girl finds out the true identity of her people.,"Okay, I shocked when I heard this film did not get the Oscars nod, except for a song. Now I have seen the film and I come to know why. This is a one liner, but developed into a longer version Except the initial parts, this film is like a limited cast/character film. Most of the film takes place in the sea sailing around fighting evil force to break the curse. But at the end, you would feel this kind of story is not worth for a feature film. It looks a perfect short animation theme.Disney never disappoints its fans, well, for me. So I enjoyed it, it was fun and entertaining, but too simple. The characters were cute, this is a wonderful film for kids and some grownups would too enjoy it. But this is not for all, unlike most of the Disney animations are. Dwayne's voice lending for one of the lead characters was good, but the girl steals the show. Especially if you are a kid and/or a girl.The best film since 'Lilo & Stitch' on the similar theme about Pacific islands' people. But it reminded me 'Whale Rider'. Overall, I think the story should have been improved a bit, in particular by including a few more characters at least for the partial appearances. This is not the best animation of the year, also definitely the bad one to skip. If your purpose of the watch is entertainment/timepass, it is good at that.6½/10"
348,Moana,7,13 February 2017,It was refreshing,"Not quite sure where the lack comes from. But at the beginning of the story, the ocean chooses Moana but based on her parent's experience have prevented her from going into the ocean. The typical child grew and was groomed to be the successor to the throne but feels something was missing. Until drastic times called for drastic measures she set sail to find Maui to return the stone to this goddess in Tahiti. and then Maui and her overcome personal struggles and other ocean adventures together and then this is were it went, blah blah blah. In the end all is good. Blah Blah Blah.The soundtrack and animation were great! The comic reliefs were entertaining but the story line was too easy to predict. Although, I am 28 years old and still watch cartoons so maybe to a toddler it wasn't so predictable after all. I'll ask my toddler to comment next time."
349,Moana,8,7 February 2017,"Nice tunes, OK film","A good film, with great music.Disney have gotten to the point where they no longer make movies, they make musicals. There have always been songs in Disneys films, but they were to convey something, not to hide the lack of plot. Disney has clearly spent a lot of time on the music, and the obligatory ""I'll tell the audience what I want""-song is great. All the other songs sounds just a bit to much alike, with the exception of Maui's song. The first part of the film is well executed, the background of Moana's life, her relationship with her family and the world around her, hopes, dreams and wishes. It's great and emotional. But from the moment she takes off it feels more like you are watching a few shot films cut together into one. Every section so so disconnected from the rest that the plot is about as great as a 8-bit video game. There is the Disney ""Minions"" coconut army. There is the giant singing crab bit. There is the Te Fiti section. That is it! Inbetween those bits you have the same glue-like formula; Maui pushes Moana in the ocean, the ocean brings her back, the chicken is ""derp"", Moana talks about Maui's responsibility.I liked the film, but I feel that it had more potential then what was done. The plot is weak and underdeveloped. Moana is the only character that has depth (well she better be since there are barley anyone else in the film). Maui is more of a bully older brother and his behavior gets old really fast. The chicken is a great comic relief, but really serves no purpose other than that through out the whole film. The best part is Moana's relationship with her grandmother, disregard that she comes back like a Jedi, a scene that actually made her previous death less emotional.I don't regret watching the film, but when I look back I don't feel it was really worth going to the movies for. Unless you watch a massive IMAX 3D version, you might as well wait for the Blu-ray to come out."
350,Moana,7,30 January 2017,"A new and beautiful princess and very different from the others, I thought the film was not what I imagined.","Moana and Zootopia are the favorites in the Oscar of best animation, with Kubo running out, I watched everyone and in my view Zootopia is the best, Moana I found the weakest, even though it is still a good movie, the animation quality is excellent , And the princess is one of the best, I enjoyed very much that she is very different from others, the voice work is excellent, Auli'i dew, Dwayne Johnson, Alan Tudik, Jemaine Clement and etc, all excellent, have good times, to Moana can win the Oscar, but I found the weakest one between Kubo and Zootopia, and I think it's a very good song, More worth watching, is a very entertaining animation. Note 7.5"
351,Moana,8,30 January 2017,A pleasant relaxing movie for the family,"To start off the review I should mention that I am an 18 year old male university student and I can say that I enjoyed this movie. When most animated movies state that they are for the whole family, they often are quite childish and boring for the older members, but I can gladly say that this movie would be enjoyable for all ages. For example there are jokes that might be wasted on the younger children that gave me a laugh. The scenery for this movie is beautiful, serene even. What worked for Tangled and Frozen definitely worked for Moana. The voice acting was ideal, beautiful singing voice from Moana. Really emotive singing and meaning behind the lyrics, while respecting the Polynesian background. The movie is simply a feel good movie, great storyline that is easy to follow but isn't spoon feeding the audience. If there was to be a negative, it would be that the main characters did not really develop their friendship, there was little character development from Moana and that the movie was quite short in comparison. Regardless, it is a great movie that I will be watching again. Fantastic job Disney!"
352,Moana,10,27 January 2017,A feminist movie,"One of the best movies I've ever watched. It's a great story about finding yourself and following your dreams plus it's female-centered without hetero-normative love interests. I mean, she doesn't even have a love interest and I think it shows kids that women don't need romance to be happy. It's very important that we have feminist movies on the big screen 'cause it's a way of influencing people in a positive way. And by 'feminist' I mean it's not chauvinist or oppressive. To parents who care about their kids education, go watch this with them. By the way, this is a movie for everybody not just kids. And the soundtrack is amazing. You will surely be singing it for the whole week."
353,Moana,7,2 January 2017,A Cultural Experience,"Despite the tedious amount of singing throughout the film, Moana (2016) revealed to an audience of a widely unknown culture through an animated story. Maui, voiced my Dwayne Johnson shows an alteration for the persona of his character as well as impacting the very story in which he plays one of the main protagonists. Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) however opens the audience to a realm of hope, duty, and resilience in which has great application to her character within this culturally defined film. Overall the mix of personalities throughout the film, as well as the adventurous tone allows Moana (2016) to be an experience worth watching."
354,Moana,7,15 December 2016,I can't complain,"Moana was a very fun movie! Compared to more recent Disney films I would score it higher than all of them (besides tangled). It was a lively and colorful experience in theaters and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.At times, the movie played out to be one-dimensional. The music didn't meet Disney standards which I think is the only reason I wouldn't score this film as a strong 8 . The main song followed throughout the movie was very good but the rest lacked. With music being such a large part of every Disney experience, I have to give this film a 7. However, I thoroughly enjoyed it and had a blast in theaters. I would recommend Moana to people of all ages!"
355,Moana,8,9 December 2016,Good. Though not a masterpiece,"A nice movie. It doesn't set the world on fire, the story's simple and predictable enough, but I assume it's not bad. The heroine looks very much like a childish version of Pocahontas, and that's the only real flaw I noticed (but, on the other hand, all Disney protagonists resemble each other). There are some naive jokes, which make the viewer rather smile than laugh loudly; there are some heartwarming characters (Gramma, the Big Wave and the Hog, not to mention the ghosts of Moana's ancestors); there is a fake hero who prefers to rest on oars and enjoy the praise for his deeds in the past. But of course he can reform and become good... if he only wants it. So, you can call it 'cliches'... however, I say it's kind of classic. All you need for an entertaining adventure & high spirited romance is there in the plot. And yes, the crab (...he rather reminded me of a cockroach...) adds greatly to the positive side of the film. His dance is brilliant (though his singing is rather silly - but who cares?) So, if you want to have a good rest after a hard work's week (or just to make your child happy), you should see this movie. If you wish something more than just a pleasant, sentimental fairy tale, you probably won't like it. Though I did."
356,Moana,8,8 December 2016,The movie was good but too much talk about the Hawaiian god's,I am going to say that I loved the movie don't get me wrong I sang laughed and just felt joyful during the movie and was able to laugh out loud at non suggestive humor.for once. I loved moans herself and her determination to succeed in what she is trying to do it is a good message to kids to never give up on your dreams no matter what the cost or how long it might take you will succeed in it if you believe in yourself and have a little help from friends . now the downside of the movie OK I am a Christian and I don't believe in hetheran god's and there is a lot of talk about that in the movie which I didn't appreciate and was needless to the movie really it doesn't need to have a plot like this to be good it can stand on its own and don't need help from the.gods.says sarcastically under my breath. But the rest of the movie was charming and good fun to watch hope this helps someone decide on whether or not to take the kids to see this or not. One more thing in advance if I helped you decide.what can I say expected your welcome yes your welcome.once you see the movie you will get the song lol hope I helped bye
357,Moana,7,3 December 2016,Good but not Disney's best,"As I walked out of the theatre after watching Moana I overheard a kid say and echo my exact feelings, ""that was goodI liked it but I don't think I want to watch it again."" Moana is a good movie; it's well acted/voiced, has a free thinking lead, and enough quirky side characters to keep you entertained but it didn't have the touch of brilliance I've come to expect from Disney. Maybe Zootopia has set the bar too high this year. I grew up watching Disney movies which were all essentially love stories and the princess needed some sort of saving (although highly impressive even Mulan brought a prince charming home at the end). So, even though she's not technically a princess, Moana is refreshingly independent. There's no prince on the horizon and she does the saving here. But is that enough reason to love the movie? Maybe. Depends on who you ask.Moana tells the tale of a young Moana who yearns to travel the seas but is held back by her father, the chief of the island they call home. She is groomed to become the leader of her people but is warned never to leave the island for the demigod Maui has incurred a centuries old curse which wrecks havoc on the seas. But the far too curious Moana must know what's out in the world and goes searching for Maui to set things right. It's a pleasant enough story but not one we haven't seen before. Curses and setting things right with the world aren't new themes and have been explored countless times before in Disney films. The movie still does a good job establishing a credible and very likable lead. Moana isn't afraid to go against the grain. She's brave and quite stubborn. And insists on saving the world, or her island, but it's the same thing. Had it been the world, I'm sure she would've managed as well.Dwane Johnson plays Maui, the arrogant demigod, who has caused all the trouble and he is an absolute riot. I had no idea Mr. Johnson was so good at voice acting. He's effortless and hilarious. Newcomer Auli'i Carvalho, playing Moana, does a fantastic job as well. Maui and Moana have an easy chemistry which makes the movie very watchable. In fact it's their dedication to the characters and the scenes between them that are the highlights of the film. Even when you know what's to come you're eager to see them achieve it. I wasn't so much interested in the story as I was in their odd relationship.The music, an inherent part of all Disney films, was the biggest disappointment. There are a lot of songs infused in the narrative but not one comes to mind after the movie is over. That's naturally a letdown since we expect to hum, get utterly sick of, and then hum again popular Disney tunes. Let's just say there's no 'Let it Go' to get addicted to in this movie.Overall I liked the movie but I didn't love it. It has a nice message and I was glad to see a female character who wasn't a damsel in distress but I expect more. Merida from 'Brave' and Elsa from 'Frozen' have already shown us you don't need to focus on the princess' love life to make a movie work so let's do more next time, Disney. Chop chop.https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com"
