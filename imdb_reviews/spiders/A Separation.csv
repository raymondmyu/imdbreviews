0,A Separation,9,2 September 2011,Do yourself a favor - make sure you see this movie,"Caught ""A Separation"" in Amsterdam last night, fully unprepared for its greatness. I hadn't been swept off my feet for a while, but this Iranian Hitchcockian drama sucked us in for 123 minutes and left us very, very impressed.I'm mainly writing this review to assure every non-Iranian IMDb-reader that you absolutely SHOULD see ""A Separation"". I will be shocked if this movie doesn't win an Academy Award. The acting is great, and the script is probably the best I've seen in five years. The genius of Asghar Farhadi's story is that it piles on the tension and drama without resorting to fireworks, trickery or shock and awe plot effects. It also manages to perfectly balance the plights of several protagonists. Very few screenwriters have this capacity.If this movie reminds me of anything, it is ""Ladri di Biciclette"" (Bicycle Thieves), which has a similar seemingly ""simple"" story setup. But then ""A Separation"" is much more developed, much more complex, much richer. Go see it."
1,A Separation,10,5 July 2011,A Perfection,"If mainstream cinema leaves you soulless, see this film. If you have a modicum of intelligence, see this film. If you like great acting and directing, see this film. If you like great writing and editing, see this film. If you have an interest in law, see this film.If you are a parent, see this film. A Separation is not harrowing or depressing. Fear not as I did before. If you don't like subtitles, you will forget they are there. Do not read any more detailed reviews. Go without preconception. A Separation deserves all the plaudits it is getting and deserves a much wider audience. Minimalistic and economic, a Separation is one of the finest, most chiselled pieces of cinema of this millennium."
2,A Separation,10,2 December 2011,"thoughtful, brilliant film","This is the first Iranian film I've seen, and I'm recommending it to every-one I know. It is so well-crafted; the twists of the plot throw up new moral dilemmas for all the protagonists, which are explored sensitively and without judgement - so refreshingly unlike mainstream American films. I felt sympathy for all the characters, even the threatening Hodjat, full of misplaced rage which often erupts volcanically. And as a footnote, the film felt like an intimate view into a society that our news media portray as monochromatic and extremely foreign. (I am writing this a few days after the UK embassy in Tehran was ransacked)"
3,A Separation,10,16 February 2011,The Swan Song of Iranian cinema?,"Asghar Farhadi's new film after the ingenious 'About Elly' is running for the Golden Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival and, with half of the competition done and the rest of the program not looking too promising, appears to be an almost inevitable winner. Although maybe it won't for that very reason: Jahar Panahi's repeat inability to attend his jury duties because of Iran's government refusal to issue him a travel permit, a retrospective of his works including the 2006 Silver Bear-winning 'Offside', a variety of other Iranian productions and renewed demonstrations in Iran proper put the spotlight firmly on that country's elaborate, yet constrained film industry. All that buzz may outshine the film's artistic value, and prompt the jury to go for a less favored competitor. I should hope not, for Farhadi manages once again to embed lots of social criticism into a straight-laced, realistic narrative.As in 'About Elly', the story begins rather unassumingly and takes an abrupt turn into a spiral of increasingly dramatic events: Nader and Simin are a couple about to break up over the question of moving abroad, for which they have obtained a permit after waiting for 18 months. Nader, however, has his father to take care of, who is suffering from Alzheimer's. Sirin still wants to leave, but not without her daughter (yes, pun intended) Termeh, a somewhat shy, bespectacled 11-year-old who cannot accept her parents' break-up. She therefore decides to stay with her father, which prompts Simin not to leave the country, but move to her mother. Nader is thereby forced to hire someone to take care of his dad, and a colleague of Sirin recommends the pregnant Razieh. Being deeply religious, she should not work in a single man's household, but her husband has been out of a job for a long time and is threatened with jail by his creditors. Her pregnancy and the necessity to attend to her daughter additionally stress her out. When Nader comes home one day to find his father left alone and tied to his bed, a struggle with the returning Razieh ensues, with catastrophic consequences for everyone around...This is a much more complicated set-up than in 'About Elly', but it allows Farhadi to put a lot of additional information into his film as may be obvious to those who are just trying to follow the story (I hesitate to give examples because the film is as of yet to be released in Iran, which means an open-source comment such as this one needs to be carefully phrased). Much of the action takes place in courtrooms, where judges try to negotiate between the parties without any lawyers present. There's a lot of familiarity, and also a lot of menace, which succeeds to create the same climate of anxiety, accusation and deceit as in 'About Elly'. The realism of the narrative is embedded into a carefully planned scenography which makes almost every shot linger in the memory. And as in 'About Elly' the decisive moment, the one that solves the mystery is omitted in the picture, only to be explained verbally at the very end.What makes me feel even more for this film is the fact that it might be the last film of its kind from Iran for some time. Ali Samadi Ahadi, the German-Iranian director of the comedy 'Salami Aleikum' and the upcoming documentary on the July 2009 protests 'The Green Wave', wrote that the film industry has come to a virtual standstill. 'Nader and Simin' was in development at the time of the protests; since then, regulations have become far more repressive, with even established masters like Kiarostami or Makhmalbaf forced to work abroad, and others threatened with jail and work prohibitions, of whom Panahi is only the most famous example. All the more reason to give this film the credit it deserves - winning Berlin may cause Iran's bureaucrats to reconsider, for cinema is almost the last link remaining to our world. Without film, how could we understand that Iranians are a modern people with issues like our own, and not dangerous fanatics as some media and politicians would have us believe?"
4,A Separation,10,25 March 2011,unsaid words can turn into a separation,"It seems that a court room drama could be the best place for Frahadi to recreate his very own world and confront us with a short and somehow faraway situations and incidents in life. We think these kinds of happenings and conflicts would not take place in our lives but with his realistic world and characters they seem so close and possible to anyone. Asghar Farhadi loves to put his audience in place of judge, as his other pictures like About Eli or Fireworks Wednesday and here with no fear he takes us straight to a court room. But the thing is that the judge does not provide any help for us to make a clear judgment and surprisingly makes the situation even more complicated. Yes Farhadi doesn't want us to make a judgment, He makes us watch and observe and leave the theater with a big fork in front of us.It Seems that any single decision creates another world full of forks and not taken ways.when nobody is clearly guilty and the line between black and white is so dim. And again here we are in Frhadi's powerful hands surprised to the end of the movie. You can't leave your chair even for one second because the story never lets you to lose even a single moment. And like a tennis ball we're always being shot from this side to the other. And finally we are the daughter shocked and disable to make a decision. May be we haven't seen or we don't want to see this side of life, where nothing is clear, when small lies and unimportant undone things and unsaid words gang up against us and turn to a big disaster. Frahadi has found his own world and his own language and his own version of life. Something we'd never seen before. We appreciate that. He can easily bombard us with information and surprise us with tiny details that seem nothing but like a snowball rolling down a slope they can form a big drama."
5,A Separation,10,24 March 2011,You be the judge...,"I'm an Iranian, but I've never been interested in Iranian cinema. I only watch Iranian films when they win awards or receive international recognition. I'm a fan of Kiarostami and Majidi, but I can't really say that I like all of their films. I watched Farhady's previous film (About Elly) about a year ago, and the first thing which struck me was how culturally detached the movie was in its depiction of an event. At the time, I believed this to have been the cause of this director's success. Watching Nader and Simin, however, proved that I was terribly mistaken.Asghar Farhady's obsession with the concept of judgment is once again the driving force behind his latest feature. The life-like depiction of the Iranian courtroom (which is in no way impartial) places the audience in the Judge's seat from the very beginning. The extremely believable acting and insanely complex script compel the viewer to make up his/her mind just like when reading a court case. As for the screenplay, I'm almost certain the events in this film actually happened in real life, because in no way could one fabricate such a chaotically complex series of events, so beautifully woven into a coherent whole.Despite being very Iranian in its narrative style and its depiction of Iranian culture (the sanctity of Family, faith, commitment towards parents and married life), I believe that this film could easily appeal to the Western audiences just like a film by Inaritu or Haneke (although I'm pretty sure it won't be nominated for an Oscar for political reasons).After seeing About Elly, I thought Farhady's success was just a one-time fling, but coming out of the theater, having watched Nader and Simin, I was proud to have another Iranian director added to my international list of favorites."
6,A Separation,9,10 October 2011,Maybe the movie of the year,"And it comes from Iran. The first thing you read on the screen is ""In the name of God"". Well, anyway it's the best story, the best cutting, the best actors you've seen for long. And few films are that stomach-turning, although there's hardly any physical violence.A wife wants to go abroad. Her husband can't because he wants to take of his senile father. The wife moves and the husband hires a woman to look after his father.And then the screw turns, although most of the story takes place in everyday Iranian life. The center of it all is perhaps the daughter, who is nearly teared apart. But it takes time until you realize that. Anyway, I can almost guarantee you sit the film through, until the final post-texts has passed.So amazingly clever."
7,A Separation,10,13 January 2012,Mankind Is Flawed,"In Tehran, the teacher Simin (Leila Hatami) has requested the divorce from her husband, the bank clerk Nader (Peyman Moadi). Simin wishes to live abroad to give a better life to her eleven year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) and Nader, who is a family man but very arrogant, wants to stay to take care of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) that has Alzheimer. Simin moves to the house of her mother and Nader hires the religious Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father while he is working. Razieh is pregnant but she does not tell her husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), who owes a large amount to the creditors, that she is working. When she arrives with her daughter Somayeh (Kimia Hosseini)at Nader's house, she distracts and Nader's father goes to the street and she goes and gets him back home. On the next day, when Nader arrives home with Termeh, they find Nader's father tied up to his bed and Razieh and Somayeh are not at home. When they arrive at home, Nader accuses Razieh of theft and expels her. Razieh feels offended and argues with him, and Nader pushes her out at the front door. Razieh falls and has an abortion. She goes to the court with her husband and the witnesses are summoned to testify. ""Jodaeiye Nader az Simin"" or the separation of Nader and Simin, is among the best Iranian films I have seen and is a fantastic drama that shows how flawed mankind is, no matter in Iran, Brazil, Europe or wherever. Despite the different values of the Iranian society comparing with the Westerns ones, all the characters are flawed; therefore, the plot is realistic. Nader is a family man that loves his father and his daughter, but commits perjury, is stubborn and arrogant and asks his acquaintances to lie. Simin uses the secret that Razieh had told her to take advantage. Termeh lies to save her father from justice. Razieh is religious and worried with Allah and sins, but she was capable to lie fearing the reaction of her husband. Hodjat is a rude and impulsive man that is violent. The direction is perfect and the acting is top-notch. The story is engaging and believable and differences of cultures between Iran and Brazil are intriguing. I really recommend this film for any cinema lover or people interested in learning a little about the Iranian culture. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Separação"" (""The Separation"")"
8,A Separation,10,28 December 2011,Wow! Just.. wow!,"-- www.Ramascreen.com --Wow! I didn't have any expectation and that's what probably helped but A SEPARATION is a great drama. Foreign language film or not, this is just an excellent, excellent drama. You can't get a more Oscar worthy material than this. To me what makes A SEPARATION unique is that writer/director Asghar Farhadi takes conflict, secrets, relationships and other elements that we're familiar with and mixes them with the culture, religion and gender elements from that specific region. This film, to a certain extent, lets you in on how the justice system works in a place where some of us may be ignorant about. And it's really not about our way is better than theirs or vice versa, it's just how different some things are doneAnd this is not just about a divorce or a separation of two individuals The film starts out that way and it ends on that note as well but what happens in between is more of a spin-off story or it stems from when the lead characters Nader and Simin stop being on the same page. A SEPARATION is a very dialogue-driven, a very character driven story, all the actors in this film are marvelous. When the tension is high, they're extremely convincing, I couldn't take my eyes off any of them, especially lead actress Leila Hatami who holds a certain photogenic beauty.On one spectrum, you have Nader and Simin with their daughter, on the other end of the spectrum you have Hodjat and Razieh with their little adorable daughter. Because Simin takes time off from her marriage with the intent to divorce her husband, Nader has to hire Razieh to take care of his father who suffers from Alzheimer's. An incident occurs that escalates into a courtroom drama but there is actually another incident or a card that Asghar Farhadi hides until it's time to show it further on in the story and the way everything progresses and eventually unravels keeps you intrigued. A big part of what draws me in is the film's depiction of Iranian law and traditions when it comes to divorces and allegations. What may be considered murder, how important it is for an individual to see someone swear on a Koran, how a judge deals with opposing alibis. I don't know how accurate it is but it's nothing short of interesting. It would certainly cause debate and discussion among the audiences as to the fairness of it all. And the story goes through those problems and makes a full round circle back to the separation of Simin from Nader. A highly engrossing film.-- www.Ramascreen.com --"
9,A Separation,,18 July 2011,Brilliant,"I saw this last night at the Auckland Film Festival and have to say it is probably the finest film I've seen this year. It starts incredibly strongly then just keeps cranking up the tension and conflict. The characters are beautifully layered, complex and fascinating and the director manages to maintain empathy for all of them until the final frame, simply not allowing us to 'take sides' - which is what the couple's daughter is being asked to do. I hope this film gets wide distribution (particularly into the U.S.) as its insight into modern Iranian family life (albeit a privileged one) might help to erase the convenient misconception that 'they' are not like 'us'."
10,A Separation,9,9 July 2011,Iranian cinema lands in the west with a bang.  Phenomenal.,"I've never seen an Iranian move but the country has a rich movie culture that has broken through with A Separation which won the Golden Bear, best actor and best actress awards at Berlin earlier this year. And I can understand why.Don't go expecting lavish cinematography, this is shot on hand held cameras, or certainly on fairly shaky tripods throughout, often under the harsh glare of fluorescent lighting that throws a watery blue cast over the action at times. But that is highly appropriate because this movie has a creeping sense of voyeurism throughout as the intensely private happenings of a family, and perhaps country, in turmoil steadily build up into a furious climax.The plot is complex to say the least, but one can keep up by fully concentrating on each twist and turn of this micro-thriller.The oppression of the Koran in this staunchly Muslim country carries a heavy burden throughout the film and it's the most frequently used prop as one of the characters in particular, the victim of a central crime, seeks spiritual guidance throughout. It's importance and oppression is palpable.The story concerns the vain attempts of a wife (superbly acted by Leila Hatami) to leave Tehran with her husband to improve the life of their 12 year old daughter. But the husband cannot force himself to leave his Alzheimer's afflicted father behind and so stalemate ensues and divorce becomes the only alternative, this results in a separation and so the father (played to perfection by Peyman Moaadi) is forced to hire a nurse to look after his desperately sad father during the day.One thing leads to another and inadvertently the husband pushes the nurse so that she ends up aborting her child.This sets off a horrendous chain of events that I will not reveal here for fear of spoiling it for you.Suffice to say the tension mounts throughout the movie and culminates in a heartbreaking decision for the couple's 12 year old daughter that is resolved in a way that Michael Hanneke would applaud vigorously.This movie deals with important themes of family loyalty (more than love), duty, the oppression and folly of religion and pride.Without overbearing pride much of the consequences of this film would not happen. Time and again you silently shout at the screen ""just do the right thing and this mess will be resolved."" They never do.It could almost be played for laughs so farcical are the the situations the main protagonists find themselves in. But this is no comedy, far from it. It's a tearjerker and feels bitterly real, believable and often futile.It's as good as its billing. See it."
11,A Separation,9,15 September 2011,Asking difficult questions,"Have you ever been watching a movie where you could not take your eyes of the screen, not even for one second to take a zip of your wine? This movie is for me a thriller, even though labeled a drama. The shoots were artistically taken; I see a beauty in a scene when a woman is walking with her long vein downstairs. Couple arguing in front of a judge where when she was asked whether the man beats her because she wants a divorce saying: no, he is a good man, but I want a divorce.This is a universal story set in Iran. Universal human emotion set in an Islamic country. It is difficult for me to pinpoint what the theme(s) of this film. Yes, it begins with a separation of a couple after years of marriage and having a daughter in stake. But that was only a trigger. A trigger to a journey that seeks the boundaries of human existences. A journey where things are not black and white, but somewhere in between. The characters have their flaws but I somehow feel sympathy for them, even for the one who is violent. Perhaps the movie is about asking question what is a good person, in a situation where it is very difficult to be one."
12,A Separation,10,20 January 2012,Fantastic film!,"This film won the best foreign language film for the Golden Globes. It blows just about everything this season out of the water. Don't, don't miss it. For all the hate-filled rhetoric spewed about Iran, this film should show the world, like so many other Iranian films, what brilliant artistry exists in this nation, what sensitive beautiful people Iranians are. Iranian actors have been honed and trained since the 1970's when the modern era of Iranian film began. The principal actors: Leila Hatami, Peyman Moaadi, Shahab Hosseini, Sareh Bayat, and Sarina Farhadi (the director's own daughter) are superb. From the first moments of the film you believe them and the truth of their existence. The stark intimacy of the film is stunning. The complicated plot is gripping and holds one's attention to the very end. It will also be fresh and novel for non-Iranian audiences. It is true in every instance to Iranian society and cultural life. Watch it and learn why American politicians have been misleading Americans about Iranian life."
13,A Separation,,4 October 2011,People lie,"Beneath the opening credits, a photocopier copies IDs, one after another.We open to a courtroom. A beautiful married couple, Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moadi) have obtained coveted visas to leave Iran for the United States, where Simin hopes to offer a better future to their 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (the director's daughter, Sarina Farhadi). Simin has red hair and determined eyes; Nader has an honest face. They address the camera as if we are the judge.""You don't have good reasons for a divorce."" Their hard-won visa expires in a month or two; Nader will not leave, Simin must, with Termeh. The problem, Nader is devoted to his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who has Alzheimer disease and is totally dependent on his son and his family. And so the couple embark on a trial separation.An upper middle-class household, a stable home, parents who value education and security for their daughter perhaps above all.Simi has found a caretaker, Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a pregnant, deeply religious woman with a young daughter who takes the job unbeknownst to her husband (Shahab Hosseini), an out-of-work cobbler. A devout woman with a young daughter (Kimia Hosseini), to mind his father while he is at work.Negotiations - she lives far away, the pay is not good, her husband does not know. The first day, grandpa pees his pants. Modesty. Razieh asks him to clean himself up; he can only ask for Simin. She makes a call to her imam for religious advice. She can clean the old man. Her daughter watches through frosted glass, ever curious.In the meantime, Nader teaches his daughter to be assertive, first with the gas station attendant.The caretaker quits. It's heavy work for a pregnant woman and a little girl. We know she's pregnant, but does Nader? It's a big problem. Who else? Razieh comes back. My husband. He cannot know you hired me. But maybe he can come.Here begins the disaster. Class war. Breakdown of families and society.The two daughters are at the heart of the story.Truth, guilt, the bitter disappointment of a child in her parents.Tense and narratively complex, formally dense and morally challenging, flawlessly crafted, brilliantly performed and intimately photographed, A Separation premiered at Berlinale, where it won the Golden Bear for Best Film as well as the top prizes for Best Actor and Actress for its male and female ensembles.""The idea for the film came to when I was sitting in the kitchen of my friend's flat in Berlin nearly one year ago. I was here preparing another film, but I decided to do this one instead. I was smoking a cigarette in the kitchen, listening to some Iranian music and then I decided to make it. The film is influenced by my personal experiences and the situation in Iran and also some abstract pictures I had in my mind. It was like a puzzle. The story was in my mind for some time but when I decided to make it it happened quickly."" - FarhadiIt began with picture of a man with Alzheimer's.""I found the button and made a suit."" Do not miss this movie."
14,A Separation,10,28 February 2012,A gripping and heart-pounding universal masterpiece ... made in Iran ...,"""A Separation"" is an intense and powerful examination of the eternal conflict between human emotions, personal convictions and Law, whether political or religious, and it happens to be I believe- the best film of 2011.The movie is set in Iran, in an upper-middle class area, and features a series of unfortunate incidents, all guided by sincere and genuine emotions, but that nonetheless end up judged by the Islamic Law. Written and directed by Ashgar Farhadi, the film is a triumph on the field of intelligence as it never patronizes the viewer by pointing a finger on an obvious 'antagonist'. Ultimately, the victims are not innocent, nor the accusers are wrongdoers, and the only 'responsible' is a Law that fails to take into consideration human feelings.Still, Law isn't negatively portrayed as it remains true to its obligatory neutrality, a notion hinted in the very first scene of the film. Indeed, the realism and intensity of the dialog, a back and forth verbal fight between a wife and a husband sets in the very first minutes what would be the enthralling tone of the film. The core of the conflict is not unusual in family dramas, it's about a child custody, Simin (Leila Hatami) wants a divorce because her husband Nader (Peyman Moadi) refuse to emigrate in a country that would in her opinion- provide a better education to her daughter Termeh, Sarina Farhadi as a strong-minded adolescent yet the hostage of an inextricable situation, even more ironic because the two parents don't want to divorce.But Nader gives legitimate reasons to his refusal: he must take care of his father, an old eighty-something man suffering from Alzheimer disease. ""But he doesn't know you!"" ""Yes, but I know him"", this brilliant exchange plays like the movie in microcosm; it's all about contradictory opinions guided by legitimate emotions or convictions. When the opening scene ends, those who agree with Simin's arguments understand Nader and vice-versa. If there is ever one, that's the greatest achievement of Farhadi's Oscar-nominated screenplay; still, the force of the script enough couldn't have elevated ""A Separation"" to such a universal and miraculously unanimous acclaim. The film works as a perfect combination of writing, acting and directing to such an extent that it could have easily been nominated to more than two Oscars without garnering much surprise.Farhadi's direction is perfect for this kind of narrative as it uses a hand-held camera work in many scenes, as to create the dizzying and uncomfortable effect of documentary-like realism. The film reminds of Cassavetes' naturalistic work in the way it conveys a sort of one-set room intimacy and place the viewer in the unsettling situation of a witness, caught in the middle of a scene, I mean by 'scene' an embarrassing and uncomfortable situation. We just see and watch, and our hearts pound from these displays of aggressiveness, hostility, cries, shouts and thankfully sometimes, love and affection. Farhadi's film is a masterpiece of storytelling on that level, proving that even plain dramas can be as emotionally engaging as thrillers, and the film does it so well that the content can invite any audience to question its own legal system, no more or no less immune from similar issues.Law has been established by men in order to find the truth within the chaotic succession of facts that can speak for two opposite sides, but the genius of ""A Separation"" is that it deals with a particular situation where no one is aware of all the facts, even the viewer is left with some hints and clues, and can only assemble them as the movie progresses. Razieh (Sareh Beyat) is a young religious mother hired as a caregiver for Nader's father. She has a miscarriage and pretends it was caused by Nader's brutality. Nader claims he didn't know anything about the pregnancy and was upset because she left his father alone. The domino's effect introduces the peripheral characters as Simin wants to protect Termeh from Razieh's hot tempered full-of-debts husband Hodjat (Shahab Hossein) who vents his anger on the system, and through his scene-stealing performance paints an indirect social commentary on actual Iran.The film is full of confrontations that are some of the most realistic ever: everything in the dialogs and the acting sounds true and make the whole experience so nerve-wracking that we never know if we're embarrassed to see these lives being destroyed or because the script didn't let us determine which side we're supposed to take. But ""A Separation"" is beyond these sterile considerations: it's not about sides to take or opinions to make, it's about the innate limits of Law. Law is even incarnated by a decent judge who shows some signs of reason and magnanimousness sometimes, and sometimes can't handle Hodjat's outbursts of anger. In a way, he embodies our position as the powerless observer of a situation that goes out of control because it engages a wide range of emotions, sometimes positive, sometimes negative but always sincere, creative a psychological cocktail about to explode if a resolution doesn't come to appease the nerves.The resolution, or let's say, the conclusion, is satisfying because it never betrays the film's 'philosophy' and leaves us with the penetrating sensation that we've just watched a miracle, a modest creation whose emotional and intellectual force spoke some uncomfortable truths about human nature and its antagonism with Law's cold realism. And on the surface, it also features an Iran far from the current stereotypes launched by the infamous ""Not Without My Daughter"", where women aren't all submissive chador-wearers and men macho wife-beaters.(I feel terrible to pollute this review with these comments because they insult the intelligence of the film, which already takes for granted that 'Iranian are normal people' but regarding the actual and scary political context, I guess it's necessary)"
15,A Separation,10,8 March 2011,That's an Iranian Drama !!,"I think this movie is the savior of Iranian cinema.Asghar Farhadi is a smart director and all of his movies are talking about Iranian society. Nowadays religious intolerance is the main problem of Iranian society and Farhadi decided to show this matter in his latest film.We have to appreciate him because at the age of poor Iranian movies we have a brilliant movie on screens. About the actors , that is the second experience of Peyman Moaadi who had seen before in last Farhadi's film (About Eli 2009), but he acted more professional than he is , as an intolerant person and doesn't let his family to go to abroad. About actresses , Leila Hatami & Sareh Bayat performed unconventionally great and I think that was the most important movie that they have ever acted in. I hope it will win the Best Foreign Language Film title in 84th Academy Awards. Good Luck for Iranian Movies , Directors , Actors & Actresses and ....."
16,A Separation,10,9 January 2012,A Separation (2011),"Gripping, tense, heartfelt, powerful, painful, and stirring, Asghar Farhadi's A SEPARATION is an intense drama that captivates like a thriller by boasting astounding performances and a truly compelling narrative arc. It is an Iranian film that centers on intimate domestic issues in the midst of extremely difficult circumstances - a purely humanistic narrative that gets better and better as it progresses, building upon layer after layer after layer of dense situations in which these poor characters are helplessly engulfed within. In creating a plethora of deep emotions that are carried out honestly and never over-the-top by the ensemble's pitch-perfect performances, Farhadi manages to weave together multiple angles that are both morally complex and excruciatingly truthful into each and every one of his primary characters (all of whom exist in the middle-to-lower class) . The plot is patiently set up with its pieces slowly establishing in place in the first few scenes before snaring the audience into a wonderfully played 123-minute thrill ride that places viewers right beside its characters - a feat that is executed through its seemingly naturally-crafted hand- held cinematography in conjunction with genuine acting that rarely calls attention to itself. The film never resorts to flashy and glitzy elements to further its story - it absolutely has no need to - and proves that sincerity in all its forms whether it be in writing, acting, or directing, no matter the budget nor technical limitations, can result in work of the highest quality. To put it simply, A SEPARATION is (personally) not only the best film of 2011, but arguably one of the most impressive lower-budgeted dramas (under 1 million dollars) in the past decade."
17,A Separation,10,6 November 2011,"Masterpiece, go watch it","I think our day to day life has more than enough material for a good movie. 'A separation' engrosses you into the life of a small Persian family and shows you what happens there. You get to watch this very closely and the final result is a superbly simple and beautiful film. The story is so real, this could have happened anywhere. There is also another nice movie by the same director - 'About Elly (2009)', but I think I liked this one more. The movie lingers, makes you think, but its not heavy on your mind, you relish the thinking, it might probably remind you of the events in your own life and what you may have done in those circumstances. In some sense, you actually cherish the fact that well - this is life. There are too many beautiful moments in this film to list, go watch it, satisfaction assured."
18,A Separation,9,6 January 2012,"you will be ""awed"" in amazement THROUGHOUT!","I'll just get to the point,if you are previewing for something to watch, there is no way you can play the 1st 3 minutes of this film and stop. It hooks you straight in, and for me, I LOVE that in films.the story is just AMAZING, and the way it's portrayed, the director makes sure you are following behind with EVERY MINUTE OF THE FILM, as it unwinds. the casting is just brilliant, as if they were just born to play this film and then die. they achieve in captivating the emotion of the story VERY well. EVERY SINGLE ACTOR int this film did a great job.what's even more amazing, it's how low budget this film is (300K us$).as a conclusion; 3 good things about this film; (1) the story-line, well written and well scripted (2) the cast, well selected, and amazing acting (3) the setting, and the lack of a score! (yes, & it was a great idea!)"
19,A Separation,10,18 February 2011,brilliant and gray!,"just brilliant! I think Farhadi knows Iran Society very well. he knows what to write and what to direct! with a look into his previous films it's very vivid that he has continued what he wants to make to a more comprehending level.i think Farhadi is the best director in Iran nowadays and it's not just his directing but he being smart. some might say Farhadi has just continued what he made in fireworks Wednesday or about Elly,but I'll say it's the way to become much more perfect.this film is about 140 min, but you don't feel pass of time at all. the drama of film is very strong. movie mostly talks about judgment and the fact that what would you do in a gray situation! this film is full of gray Characters and situations. the movie is gray!"
20,A Separation,10,20 April 2011,"A real tearjerker that helps the audience to think about important but forgotten concepts like responsibility, love, and sacrifice in the 21st century","The new movie of Asghar Farhadi is a melodrama that captures the theme of responsibility and honesty as well as love, religiosity, and sacrifice. The movie starts with an argument for divorce between Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi) before a judge in an Iranian court. Through their argument, the main storyline of the movie becomes clear for us so that we become aware that Nader and Simin have been planning to move to a European country to provide better opportunities, as Simin claims in the court, for their only daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi).Although Nader was interested in the idea of living abroad a few months earlier, he refuses then because of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) who suffers from Alzheimer. When, in the court, Simin says to Nader ""your father does not even know you"" Nader answers ""but I know him."" Here, the responsibility of a child toward his father is very tangible. During the movie, Simin insists on the idea of going abroad; when Nader refuses, she believes there is no other way for them except to divorce. Because Simin does not live with her husband and her daughter anymore, Nader decides to hire a reliable and responsible nurse for his father. Therefore, Razieh (Sareh Bayat) enters their house as the nurse.On the first day of her arrival, Nader's father forgot to say that he needed to go to rest room. Therefore, Razieh, as a woman who really believes in strict rules of religion, does not like to come again to take care of Nader's father. Actually, she does not want to help an old man to go to rest room and even wash him. On a second thought, Razieh agrees to become his nurse again just because she needs the money. One day Nader comes and sees that his father has fallen from his bed and does not move. He thinks his father just passed away. However, he is still alive and becomes OK after a few minutes. Nader becomes very angry of what he calls "" Razieh's irresponsibility"" because she left the house and there is no sign of her. When she comes back, Nader brawls with her and pushes her out of the house and Razieh falls on the stairs that causes the abortion of her baby and a new challenge for Nader and Simin appears.Nader is accused of killing Razieh's baby intentionally. Razieh claims that Nader pushed her though he knew she was pregnant; Nader denies it. In the court, Razieh's husband, Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), who is a nervous man and does not have any job and has many debts, fights several times with Nader and insults him harshly. Termeh knows that his father is lying because she is sure that Nader heard the story of Razieh's pregnancy when she was talking about it with Termeh's tutor, Miss Ghahraii (Merila Zare'i). She is right! Nader and Simin agree to give some money to them to finish the story democratically. However, Nader insists on the idea of being sure whether he was guilty or not. That is why Nader asks Razieh to swear if he is guilty of the abortion of her baby. Although Hodjat really wants to get the money, Razieh refuses to swear because she thinks she is not sure whether the abortion of her baby was because of Nader or the accident that she had on the same day. Due to her religious beliefs, she does not want to get blood money From Nader when she is not sure whether he is guilty or not.Finally, Nader and Simin agree to let Termeh choose her destiny by saying whether she prefers to live with her father or her mother. Like ""about Eli"", the previous film of Farhadi, the ending of the story is not clear and it is up to the audience to guess whether Termeh wants to live with her father or her mother.There are scenes in the movie that are very impressive: When Nader is washing his father's body, while crying deeply, it shows us how a child loves his father no matter he is too old or sick. In addition, when Termeh asks his father about the reason that he told a big lie to the court, we can understand once more how children monitor their parents' behavior as their reliable role models. In addition, when Nader's father holds Simin's hand strongly which shows that he knows her well and no one, even Razieh, can look after him like the way that his daughter-in-law did in the past. ""Nader and Simin, a Separation"" really deserves to be considered as one of the top 250 movies ever made. In the 21st century, when we are surrounded by thousands of science fiction movies, ""Nader and Simin, a Separation"" is a good example of a real-life movie which can help people to revise their ideas about important concepts like responsibility, love and sacrifice."
21,A Separation,10,24 November 2011,"GREAT FILM, one of the best films in 2011..","A married couple are faced with a difficult decision, to improve the life of their child by moving to another country or to stay in Iran and look after a deteriorating parent who has Alzheimers (plot).First thing iam sure this film will get nominated by the Academy for best foreign language film and i hope Mr.Farhadi won, because he deserved.Secend thing the film present a very simple story about Nader and Simin have been planning to move to a European country to provide better opportunities, as Simin claims in the court, for their only daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi).Third thing, Nader refuse to leave his father and Simin need her daughter to go with her, but the problem with the daughter, she want one thing like all the children in the worlds, one house and lovable parents.Finally, "" this film really deserves to be considered as one of the film of the year and i deserves the high rating in IMDb site, ""A Separation"" was good example of a real-life movie which could help people to revise their ideas about important concepts like responsibility, love and sacrifice."
22,A Separation,9,1 January 2012,"Masterful Acting, Directing, Storyline!!!","Wow, i haven't caught a show that's been more real and intense in years. The acting and directing for this film made me feel like i was watching a documentary. That in itself is laudable. As the story unfolds you the viewer is left to guess the plot and to second guess yourself as to who the protagonists or antagonists are in the film. The film manages to grasp and reflect human nature which is complex and multi-faceted. You'd be left guessing and predicting the plot while trying to understand the characters and the choices they make. The film also aids us in understanding the roles of religion and culture... and more into human characteristics that go beyond those. A great film that i'm still thinking about and the acting and directing really shone through it all to help make this film so realistic and personal to the audience. Two thumbs up and no wonder it has been so highly rated!"
23,A Separation,,13 October 2011,most touching movie making you think but not cry,this is one of the most heart breaking and real movies I have seen this year. you can not leave the movie for even 1 second and characters are such real ones that you start to put yourself in their position and think what would I do? it is a must see movie as Turkish drama lover person i may suggest every drama fan to watch this breath taking real natural real movie. these Iranian people are god's blessings bravo... the actor is like born to act as if he is living his real life. the relationship between daughter and father and wife and husband seem so natural for those who know that culture. I should also add that the performance of the cleaner woman is very satisfactory.
24,A Separation,,20 December 2011,Entirely captivating,"Today I had the pleasure of watching A Separation, a foreign film that has been critically-acclaimed for some time now. What we have here is definitely one of the year's best films. Intriguing, captivating, and ambiguous.I had no idea that this was going to turn out to be some sort of court drama. I just want to first talk about the direction. Farhadi masterfully constructs these characters, and we enter into a state in their lives where we serve as some sort of observant. Even before the actual plot of the film comes along, his tight screenplay and direction leave us trying to astutely observe what is happening around every corner of the frame. We barely know these characters, and yet, tension is arising from the simplest of every-day matters. Why? Why indeed, as it becomes apparent, the film gets more serious in its plot. It is here that the real reason as to why we are observing moments of these characters' lives comes into focus. Questions arise, as to who did what, and who saw what, and who heard this or that. The film takes a neutral ground in all of this, and yet we ourselves can't help but try to memorize even the smallest of details that could perhaps help us out in figuring out the actual truth. The film never judges its characters, which is why we also have to be sort of neutral in all of this, even when we don't want to, even when we think we know what really happened. This is a mystery in the most unusual and most natural way. We are hooked into the film's plot line, and as much as the film won't let us go, we don't want to let go. We want to hang on and catch up with it, and not miss one single beat of what is happening. Such precise and balanced filmmaking.I do want to take note of the fantastic performances. The entire cast is wonderful, especially the three main leads. Not one single moment is wasted in their portrayals. Overall, this is a near-perfect film, one of the most intriguing and engaging films of the year, and the ending serves entirely to what had come before, and is fully satisfying."
25,A Separation,8,16 January 2012,The Best Film of 2011,"2011 was especially bleak for films in general with the exception of a few. This film however towers over all the few bright lights that emerged and gave it a kick in the chest to bring to life of what has otherwise been a forgettable year. ""A Separation"" is a film which hails from Iran, a country which despite it's oppressive regime has always managed to surprise the world with a few film gems of it's own, and this might be the jewel in the crown. Directed by Asghar Farhadi, the film talks about love, bitterness, sorrow and happiness that befall a family during it's arduous times. In this case the tumultuous period is personified by the separation that the two main characters are going through. This is not because that they are not in love with each other anymore, but because their circumstances and their goals are far apart from each other to achieve any hope for reconciliation. The wife wants to leave for America because she believes that the move will bring hope to their daughter's life. The husband does not want to go because he has to care for his ailing father who is suffering from Alzheimer. Both the causes are noble and are for the things they deeply care about, but it is also tearing them apart and brings forth further predicaments to all characters within the film as it puts into perspective the lengths people will go to protect, not only their families, but also themselves.The film is a return back to grounded realism and the influences to the film can be attributed to Ozu, Satyajit Ray who used simplicity to tell their story to enhance the aspect of reality. The directing in the film uses a perfect pace to piece together the events and the director creates a screen to personify his neutrality, as he engages the crowd to assess what they think. This was a technique used by Ozu with a certain guile which has never been matched, but I am sure even the Japanese Master would appreciate the feat achieved by the director. Farhadi did however use some aspects of fundamental camera grammar created in Hollywood film-making to express the varying reactions to the characters embroiled in it. The writing was ingenious and strayed as far away from melodrama as possible to create a scenario where the screen was inhabited by ordinary people and dealt with their feelings with a certain subtlety rarely seen today. The acting was unbelievable and it strengthened the mood for realism as the director got great performances from Peyman Moadi, Leila Hatami, Sareh Bayat and Shahab Hosseini. Their characters were very different and they dealt with their situations as such but the actors hit the note with their characters to show their desperation, their fear, their love in a way which was believable for them to do so. The star of the film was Sareh Bayat who should be nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Razieh, Nader's father's nurse, and it also brought to screen the genius of the young Sarina Farhadi (the daughter of the Director) who was on screen not because of her father, but because she deserved the merit on her own as proved. All in all, this is a great film and it would be a major crime if the Oscars do not recognize it's greatness simply because it is not in English. Nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Actor and Best Supporting Actress are certainly due unless the Academy loses it's brain once again. A great watch for everyone and if you haven't seen it, see it now so that you don't miss out on what has truly been the film of the year."
26,A Separation,10,30 December 2011,A Story of Responsibility and Truth,"Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are a middle-class, modern, urban Iranian couple. They have been married for fourteen years, but they're separating. They were going to divorce, but the court ruled that their situation wasn't dire enough to warrant it. They each have their side of the story. Simin desires to leave their country, as she does not want her eleven-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), growing up under current conditions. Nader, on the other hand, wants to stay so that he can look after his elderly father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), now in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. Their situation becomes much more complicated after an incident, one directly involving the caregiver Nader hired to watch his father during the day. What begins as a simple argument between two people quickly escalates into arduous legal action and a heated battle over what really happened.""A Separation"" is surely the best film of the year. Apart from being a portrait of characters that are just as fascinating as they are compelling, it's an intelligent and uncompromising examination of culture; within the course of what appears to be a simple narrative, we will have been told a thing or two about gender roles, parenting styles, personal values, the rule of law, and religious beliefs as they apply to present-day Iran. Although not a courtroom drama in the Hollywood sense, it has the superb plotting of a tightly-wound legal thriller, the characters in a desperate struggle to reconstruct a singular event out of several accounts. It is, above all, a timely and universally resonant story of responsibility and truth, the latter of which proves to be open for debate.I want to word the rest of my review as carefully as possible, as the incident in question is dependent on actions that shouldn't be spoiled. Based on Simin's recommendation, Nader hires a lower-class young woman named Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to be his father's caregiver. Deeply religious, Razieh went against her own traditions by applying for the job without the approval of her husband. She resorted to this only because her family is desperately in need of money. There are three reasons why she proves herself the wrong person for the job, although I will only reveal two of them. First, getting to Nader's apartment requires a grueling commute on several buses. Second, she's forced to bring along her daughter, who's clearly too young to be in an environment of a man with Alzheimer's. It's not just a question of exposure to something potentially traumatic; in her innocence, she doesn't see the harm of fiddling with the pressure knob of his oxygen tank.My careful wording will now devolve into maddening vagueness. Someone makes a very bad decision, leaving someone else's life at stake. Not long after, something goes missing. The person it belongs to immediately accuses someone else of stealing, and indeed, this someone else does have a motive. This leads to a verbal altercation, which then leads to ... the incident I've alluded to several times now. At this point, an already challenging film transcends itself by drawing us into a twisted moral quandary. Several pivotal characters are introduced as the incident turns legal. We meet Razieh's husband, Houjat (Shahab Hosseini), who has been unemployed for several months now and cannot speak without resorting to anger. We also meet an upstairs neighbor, who may have witnessed something important, and Termeh's teacher, who testifies on behalf of Nader.Caught in the middle is Termeh, who not only must endure her father's legal troubles but must also watch as both her parents continue to fight. We're repeatedly compelled to ask ourselves which of them truly has her best interests at heart, although that would be senseless simply because it's never as clear cut as we would like it to be. This is the kind of film in which we can identify with both sides of an issue; each character makes valid points, just as each character makes weak arguments. The more we learn about the situation, the murkier it becomes. That's because there's far more on the table than a series of actions.What it really comes down to are the beliefs with which we shape our lives. For Razieh, it's a matter of her faith, to which she is bound. Consider the fact that she's forbidden from touching a man other than her husband; when she discovers that Nader's father is incontinent and has peed in his pants, she must make a phone call to determine whether or not she can change him. For the secular Nader and Simin, it's a matter of personal pride. One will propose a financial settlement while the other will refuse to take part in it, as it will come off as an admission of guilt. They both think they know best, not just for their daughter but also for the situation at hand. By the end of ""A Separation,"" more than one person will be faced with making a difficult decision, one that will depend entirely on their understanding of what they perceive. And isn't that was truth is? Perception? -- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
27,A Separation,10,30 March 2012,a masterpiece!,"one of the best films i've seen in the last couple of years is surely 'a separation'. most of the award winning iranian films i'd watched before were either political or were showing a very dark image of the country but unlike those 'a separation' is a social drama. it's very rare that a foreign film gets praised by both national and international critics and audience.Farhadi's film takes us into lives of some ordinary people but with his brilliant script he takes our breath away and the suspense stays with us all the way until the end.another admirable thing about this film is that it shows us a real insight from inside Iran, not the way it was presented to us by Hollywood. it made me feel so much closer its people, they're not so different from us.and there was only one movie i gave a 10 in 2011 and it was 'a separation'. if you have n't watched it yet do yourself a favor and watch it."
28,A Separation,10,28 May 2012,right or wrong.  right and wrong.,"I wouldn't have been more glued to the screen if I watched a blockbuster action movie. I've seen too many of them, I forget them before the credits roll. Now, it's a film without any nudity, crime lords, drugs or swearing to pin me down for a breathless, profound two hours.What is morally right? What is morally wrong? What is legally right? What is legally wrong? It depends, is the film's answer. And do you know what? I agree. I agree with this answer from a film that comes from the other side of the world, from a country which I perceive to have religion and politics utterly different from mine. Because the film transcends the detail, it just shows the essence of being human. The characters just keep on trying to do the best for them or their family in credible situations which can apply to anyone and anywhere, but the choices they make will conflict at one time or another with some moral or legal tenet. The husband, the wife, the daughter, the old man's carer, the carer's husband, the daughter's teacher, even the judge  they all want to do the right thing, but they don't. Or do. Or don't. Or do. The beauty of this film is that it just tells the story. It doesn't take sides. It doesn't force on us an opinion on whether the choice was right or wrong. If it tried, I probably wouldn't have liked it as much, because it would have to conflict with some of my own views. Everyone has firm opinions, until life carries you to situations like this film's, and then nothing is black and white any more.For as long as there are creators like the director and writer of this film, there is hope for the independents. A story like this will beat any Hollywood-esque film to the punch. It's flawlessly played and it's technically well done. It doesn't need more to move me."
29,A Separation,8,10 July 2011,Moving domestic drama,"I have never lived in Iran, so I cannot comment on the accuracy of the film as a portrait of Iranian life. But it certainly convinced me of its authenticity in terms of the problems faced by most ordinary people at lot of the time. I assume that the characters were played by actors, but they never seemed like actors and never intruded their own personalities into the piece. The film raised a number of importance moral questions, without preaching at the viewer and no easy answers were offered. I had one reservation - about an event hidden from the viewer but critical to an understanding of the action. However, apart from this, I thought it was excellent."
30,A Separation,10,9 March 2012,Breathtaking!,"In my opinion this is the best movie of the year! It is an amazing drama (you read thriller) centered around two families in Iran. The movie shows the complexity of the Iranian society (something that is missing in our media). The dialogues are breathtaking, acts are amazing and the script is one of the best I have ever seen.from here contains spoiler....!I had never heard my heart beating so hard, as it was beating when the judge called Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) inside the little court room to ask her if she, in fact was the one who told her dad about the pregnancy!And my favorite dialogue of the movie was when Nader was practicing some vocabulary with Temeh, he was reading some words of foreign origin (in Persian) and Termeh was supposed to answer the Persian equivalent of them. They reached to the word ""Guaranty"", Termeh answered with an Arabic word, at this point Nader objected by saying that this is Arabic not Persian, so he offered a Persian word instead. Termeh then said but our teacher said so, and Nader goes:""What is wrong is wrong to matter who said it or where it is written."" Perfect!"
31,A Separation,10,24 February 2011,best Iran's film  iv seen ever!,"Like About....... Elly, which won Farhadi the best director award at Berlin two years ago and which went on to find release in many territories, it has the potential to engage Western audiences with the right handling. The movie is centered on a couple, Nader and Simin, and their 11-year old daughter, Termeh. Nader and Simin are about to leave the country for good; however, Nader has a change of heart and decides to stay and look after his father who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Simin is determined to get a divorce and leave the country with her daughter, but the court does not find in her favor. Simin goes to live with her mother and Termeh return Politics are ostensibly out of the picture, though the whole premise is based on a middle-class couple's divorce because the wife Simin (Iranian star Leila Hatami) wants to move abroad to find a better future for their 11-year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). But that may not be the real reason for the separation.Nader (Peyman Moaadi, seen in About Elly) is a decent man but a stubborn one, and he neglects his wife. Too proud to ask her to stay with him, he lets her move back to her mother's place while he and Termeh are left to look after his aged father with Alzheimer's disease. He hastily hires a poor woman named Razieh (Sareh Bayat) as a daytime caretaker, who signs on without telling him she's pregnant (or does she?). A few days later he fires her and shoves her out the door; she falls on the stairs (perhaps) and has a miscarriage. The rest of the film is a crescendo of tension as Razieh's hot-headed, debt-ridden husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) takes Nader to court for manslaughter. While the intricate screenplay ratchets up tension as it raises the stakes for its characters from scene to scene, its reliance on contrivance might irritate some viewers. Indeed, the conceit of Nader and Simin's separation occasionally appears as a petty battle of wills, something that undermines the weight of other events.after 30 min , new details are added that changes the moral perspective. Rather remarkably, Farhadi's screenplay doesn't take sides with any of the characters; on the contrary, everyone seems equally right and wrong at the same time. They are all caught in a web of pride and ego, morality and religion, money and honor."
32,A Separation,10,27 February 2012,"Simple yet so complex, ''a separation'' is a stunning tour de force","A separation is one of those movies you watch that makes you speculate, that fascinates you at a profound level. Asghar Farhadi has managed to pull of the perfect masterwork, the maturity of the movie, the performance of the actors; this is by far the best movie i have ever seen.The plot was well maintained, the concept of the movie was enthralling, everything in the story was well structured, the moral values that has been shown and portrayed so beautifully proves that mankind is flawed no matter what unity is the answer to some of our problems.This movie simply shows us the other real part of our society, the true problems the genuine issues between two human being, leaving the whole word behind ''A Separation'' distinguish some very important matter in our civilization."
33,A Separation,8,21 January 2012,"A Peek into Iran's Family, Religious and Justice Systems","""A Separation"" is the foreign-language film of this year's awards season. After it won the Golden Globes last week, you know it is a cinch to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film and most probably win the coveted prize for its country of origin, Iran.""A Separation"" is about a middle-class Iranian family. In the first scene, husband and wife are divorcing after 14 years of marriage because of a disagreement on migration. Wife wants a better life abroad, while husband does not want to leave his Alzheimer-stricken dad. Caught in the middle is their 12-year old daughter. When wife leaves their home, the husband hires a poor woman to be his dad's caretaker while he is at work. From there, this harrowing family and societal drama evolves into situations you will not expect. The climax and the ending were so effectively executed. You will not want to leave even while the final credits are already rolling.It appears that director Azghar Farhadi is really a big name in Iran, and that he already has previous acclaimed films. I will want to check them out. His control of his story and his actors (who you would not even remember are acting) is amazing. You get sucked into the story, and you will not want to get to the bottom of things until the final resolution. It has an underlying allusion to the conflict between the old and the new customs. It is an interesting peek into the family dynamics, religion and criminal justice system in Iran. I have seen only one other nominee in the last Golden Globe, ""The Flowers of War."" The scope and genre of the two films are vastly different and is hard to compare. But I could say that ""A Separation"" is the tighter and better- written film."
34,A Separation,10,5 March 2012,"A lot of complexity of life, relative to all cultures","I was expecting an excellent film and got even more than I expected. I was lucky enough to have an Irani friend for about six years before I moved from Northern California. During those six years I began to see a humanity in my friend that I did not expect. Like almost everyone in America we have been taught that Iran is our enemy. That their religious beliefs were so different than ours that there was little hope of closing that gap. That reconciling those differences would forever cause us a chasm. Or at the very least a great tension.When I came to the movie I expected things to go very wrong. The screen writer leads us into deep tension in which most movies would treat differently. The characters treated us with how much compassion there could be amongst us all.If there was a lesson to learn it is that being right can be wrong, and being wrong can be right. Its a paradox that the movie respects the audience enough to come to their own conclusions.It is too bad that the movie could not be nominated for an Oscar as the best film of the year. Its a great tribute to independent film. I can only hope we see more movies like this."
35,A Separation,,24 December 2011,The Crown-Jewel of Iranian Cinema,"Simplest in its approach, minimalist in its presentation, economic in its creation & artistically subtle A Separation is one of the perfectly flawless films of 21st century and arguably the finest that Cinema of Iran has offered so far. It's a riveting, suspenseful drama that is highly gripping & involving, tough to let go, morally & emotionally draining but in the end, it's totally worth it.It's difficult to say whether it's the writing or the direction that's the best part of this film because Asghar Farhadi has done a tremendous job in both fields and the film is only elevated to further greatness by its sheer perfection in other filmmaking departments like performances, cinematography, editing etc and even with its simplest narration manages to keep the best of our attention throughout its runtime.Definitely the best film of its year & certainly one of world cinema's finest, A Separation is a gritty portrayal of a domestic life in contemporary Iran that is destined to be remembered & admired for a long, long time. An Instant Classic. A Solid Masterpiece. Strongly Recommended.Full Review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com"
36,A Separation,10,14 March 2012,A Complex Masterpiece.,"'A Separation' is quite simply one of the best films I think I've ever seen. Its a film you can't think stop thinking about, and it seems to live with you afterwards.The film opens with a married couple filing for divorce. Their names are Nader and Simin. Simin, the wife, wants to leave Iran to go to American with their daughter Termeh. She states that she doesn't want her daughter growing up in ""the circumstances"" of Iran. Nader, the husband, says he can't leave because his ill-father still lives with them in Iran. Right in the opening scene, we as the audience are already forced into a challenging moral dilemma. This is the one of many moral questions we are asked during 'A Separation.'Soon Simin goes to live with her mother, and Nader and Termeh stay in their house. To look out for his father, Nader hires Razieh, a devout follower of Islam who belongs to a lower class. One day when Nader and Termeh come home, they find Nader's father on the ground tied to the bed. Soon Razieh returns to the house. Nader forces Razieh and her daughter out of his house.Now it may clearly seem that Razieh is in the wrong. But there is still so much to learn about the characters and the mysteries revolving around this simple event. We learn that Razieh had a miscarriage, and Nader is accused of murdering her unborn child when he forced her out of the house. She claims Nader pushed her and she fell down the steps. 'A Separation' is a very character-driven film, but one thing special about it is its original narrative. We don't see all of what happens, and new pieces of information pop up organically and in inventive ways. 'A Separation' almost plays out as some sort of murder-mystery. In this film, there are no heroes or villains. These are just flawed everyday people. Asghar Farhadi does a great job of bouncing sympathy between his characters. At one point in the film, you may feel strongly about one character, but when you learn something important about them, you feel a different way. Everything is grey. There's no simplicity. And that is why 'A Separation' is a complex masterpiece. Its a film that forces you to determine what you think what is right, and what is wrong."
37,A Separation,10,29 January 2012,A haunting masterpiece.,"This is unlike any movie you have seen. The depth of the character development is a refreshing change from the Hollywood genre. The characters create an emotional storm from protagonist to antagonist on a dime. At the end of the movie, ask yourself how much you relate to the characters, and you will come to the same conclusion.The carefully crafted story is genius. Topics from the law, to dedication to family, religion, and the truth all come to light. This movie will leave you thinking. As with the entire Persian movie genre, expect it to challenge you personally and institutionally. The open ended plot will leave you talking about this movie for years to come.The acting is absolutely haunting. I have never seen a movie bring to light the chemistry and absolute Stanislovsky approach to acting that this movie does seamlessly. Roger Ebert called this the best movie of the year. For me, it was the best movie of the decade."
38,A Separation,9,24 January 2012,A Simple film with its complexity,"A Separation is not only a film with a good story  but it also shows a different image of Iran and the people who live there. We always have a wrong image of them because the occidental media want us to think that they are different from us (the occidentals)  but they are not. They are people who work, who pick up the children at the school, who have personal and familiar issues  just like we have. It really should have a good distribution to change this way of thinking.The film is beautifully made and the characters are built like real humans  not superficial or predictable as we have been seeing in a lot of mainstream films. They are strong - in their personalities and emotions. But, as real humans, they do something that we usually do: lie. The film - and the audience will only discover this at the end - has its whole conflict based on this issue. Just to show us how one lie can lead to misunderstandings that we don't have any control.Overall, it is a simple film but complex at the same time  simple because it is not a big production, but complex because it deals with so many human emotions that even us in real live sometimes can't deal with.I recommend."
39,A Separation,10,16 January 2012,"Shredding!! multilateral in metaphors, prevaricate in portraying life...","Where there is limitation, lurks beauty and art. This best justifies why ""A Separation"" engulfs the viewer to contemplate on more than meets the eye on screen. In a cinema (Iran), which barely leaves any room to openly debate, or perhaps pitch into beliefs and disbelieves, this gem ingeniously sneaks out from dilemmas involved in matrimony state of a couple, depreciated and devastated enough to take refuge in a separation. ""A Separation"" is about inability of judiciary system when it comes to moral phenomenons, while ironically implies on corrupted legal systems and its vicious regression. We are being asked by many complicated questions during the entire movie. A predicament where an immaculate child is condemned to confess what is not ethically right, nor is true, just in order to sustain the union of her semi-disjointed family viable. Farhadi masters the story while developing it in such a way which incapacitates the viewer to make unequivocal and straightforward judgments by asking labyrinth-like questions within a situation where all of us could have been through. Last but not least, through the entire movie the viewer is somehow being interrogated about the inevitable intersection of religion, faith and beliefs."
40,A Separation,10,29 January 2012,Phenomenal,"Leading up to the Oscars, I like to give my attention to the films nominated in the main categories. Foreign Language is usually a favourtie of mine since foreign films seem to capture the genuineness of human character so much better than ordinary American films. A separation is no exception.Although different movies in their own respect, I find myself compelled to compare this movie to Oscar nominated ""The Descendants."" The story and plot may be different, but they are both character driven and accordingly a comparison is necessary, especially considering that the quality of character study in both movies has considerable disparity. In short, A separation succeeded in every respect The Descendants failed.The Descendants felt like it forced comedy into a drama, which did not fit well at all. Although comedy may stem from drama itself, having it as a separate theme in the movie was a big downfall in my opinion.A separation, in comparison, focuses on drama. It is a much more realistic portrayal of human character and potential actions and choices they may make. Occasional comedic comments are made, but not to the extent that it is ""comedy"" per se, but rather you laugh at the situation itself. For instance, in one scene, the father tells his daughter that what her teachers at school have taught her is wrong (from an academic perspective, not moral). The daughter replies that she must however write the ""wrong"" answer in the test otherwise she would be deducted marks off her paper, to which the father replies ""let them."" It's a moment where we get to both smirk at the situation and also understand the sense of beliefs and values of the family.The true gem of this movie lies within its script, plot and acting. The acting is superb. The script is marvelous. And the plot evolves in such a manner that it questions our very own beliefs of what is right and wrong in one of the most complicated scenarios ever created in a realistic drama. I have never seen so much ""gray"" in a film. The right and wrong actions of characters are blurred to such an extent we end up sympathizing with them all. That is the beauty of this film. No one is better than the other. Everyone is wrong and justified at the same time. Everyone is human.I will be showing this movie to as many people as I can. I was truly touched."
41,A Separation,9,8 March 2012,"Splendid, Extraordinary, Wonderful... you name it!","One of the best movies I've seen in the last couple of years. It just shows you that life is not only black and white. Great characterization, one of those movies where you don't have good and evil characters. It is so deep and well developed, simply filled with greatness and if there was more justice in this world this movie should have won more than ""only"" one Oscar. Every character is well implemented in the story and it just keeps you in front of the screen until the end. Please see this movie, you won't regret it :) Iran seems to have very talented actors and directors. I'd give 10 to the acting, especially to the young girl Somayah and Peyman Moadi as well. I'm glad I discovered this actor and I hope so to see him in more movies. Really really talented. I promise you, you'll enjoy it. Prepare for the greatness and please see it in the cinema because you'll enjoy it more."
42,A Separation,10,4 March 2012,inside Iran,"While most reports about Iran have centered on its nuclear program, ""Jodái-e Náder az Simin"" (called ""A Separation"" in English) takes a look at the lives of the Iranian people. It focuses on a family falling apart, and how events proliferate from this. Every character is flawed but well-meaning, and so the audience can't really ""side"" with one character over the others. The basic gist of the movie is how this moral conundrum affects every person.The movie is now particularly famous because it is the first Iranian movie to win Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Accepting his Oscar last Sunday, director Asghar Farhadi reminded viewers that when there is talk of war, we truly need to see Iran for its great history and not accept a one-dimensional view of it. That was without a doubt the most important part of the ceremony, and ""A Separation"" is one of the best movies that I've seen in a long time. Definitely worth seeing."
43,A Separation,9,21 January 2012,"A powerful, realistic, and beautifully acted drama","""Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking together in the same direction."" ~Antoine de Saint-Exupery The ability to see events from different perspectives is one of the most important elements of a successful relationship, whether it involves a married couple, a parent and child, or a group of nations. Warring parties are always convinced that they have right or, in some cases, God on their side. To them, every action they take is fully justified and every act the other party takes is sinister. The failure to see other people's perspectives is in full view in Asqhar Farhadi's brilliant A Separation, winner of the Best Foreign Film award at the Golden Globes and nominated for an Oscar in the same category. Farhadi does not ask us to choose sides but to observe how decisions made with good intentions and for the alleged benefit of others often have the opposite effect.The film opens in a courtroom in Tehran as Simin (Leila Hatami) speaks to a judge, unseen by the camera, asking him to grant her a divorce from Nader (Peyman Moaadi) her husband of fourteen years. Simin wants to leave the country and take her 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), with her to seek better opportunities abroad. Nader, a bank employee, however, will not leave Iran because of his responsibility to care for his elderly father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) coping with Alzheimer's disease. Even though they have been married for fourteen years, there does not seem to be any hint of compromise. Unable to obtain the divorce because the judge deems the issues not ""serious"" enough, the couple agrees to separate with Simin going to her mother's house and Termeh staying with her father.To help care for his aging father, the well-off Nader hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a pregnant, less affluent young woman with a four-year-old daughter. Whether or not Nader knows she is pregnant will become a contentious issue later in the film. Razieh, a devout Muslim, who has not told her husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) about her employment, is conflicted when she has to change the clothes of the incontinent old man, and feels compelled to ask an Islamic authority if it would be considered a sin. Things become even worse when Nader returns from work and finds his father lying on the floor barely breathing with Razieh nowhere in sight. When Razieh returns home after she claimed she had to do an important errand, an angry Nader accuses her of stealing money and asks her to leave immediately.Resistant to leave, he pushes her out the front door, causing the pregnant woman to fall down the stairs. Events begin to spin out of control when Razieh has a miscarriage and her irate husband takes Nader to court for murder. As the case is presented in a preliminary hearing before a judge, the divide between the families escalates and each person is guilty of concealing the truth in order to protect themselves or a family member. A Separation may sound like a melodramatic soap opera, but it is far from it. It is a powerful, realistic, and beautifully acted drama full of constant tension and uncertainty, a film in which each person must confront the fact that the walls they have erected have not led to nurturing relationships.While the film is not overtly political, an underlying sub-text is the depiction of a male-dominated autocratic theocracy, a political system based on force, oppression and the alienation between gender and class. Eager to enhance their daughter's education, the couple hired Miss Ghahraii, a teacher (Merila Zare'i) from her school to come to their flat to provide coaching for her upcoming exams, but it is painfully clear to see how much more she is respected than Razieh, who stays in the kitchen during family gatherings. As the adults fight over perceived injustices, the children, as is often the case, endure the most pain, conflicted by their love and dependence on their parents and their desire for morality and justice.While Termeh seemingly hides her pain, her face reflects the terrible burden her parents have put on her by their inability to see the world from other points of view, the kind of tragedy that has plagued mankind for centuries. As Farhadi has wisely said ""What I hope is that the viewer will not know whose victory to wish for."" When responsibility, love, and sacrifice are not present, there can be no victory for anyone."
44,A Separation,10,3 January 2012,2011 at its finest. Nothing in this movie is less than great.,"I may not have terribly much to say about A Separation, but I can say this much, it is a wonderful movie that I found nothing to truly complain about, even nit picking.The movie's script by writer/director Asghar Farhadi is impeccable, expertly balancing the development and screen time of his characters. But it's not just his characters that really grab my attention, it's the themes and narratives that he showcases so smoothly that he only makes it look easy. He brings together a hefty number of universal themes not only of divorce and separation, but also of religion, neglect of responsibilities, and moral inconsistencies.Farhadi also does well with his actors. A talented ensemble cast which includes Peyman Maadi, Leila Hatami, Shahab Hosseini, and Sareh Bayat are all aces in their roles, and Farhadi brings everything they can give out of them, none of them ever being giving mediocre conviction. In fact, there's not a hint of mediocrity in the movie at all.This will probably go down as one of the best movies I'll see all year, if not the best. It's not QUITE perfect, but it's damn close.**** out of ****"
45,A Separation,10,29 December 2011,Insightful and challenging - a brilliant movie!,"At a time of great ignorance in the west of life in modern Iran this film provides some useful insights. I was struck by how similar the issues are in some ways to those of a British couple facing separation, yet also by the extent of the cultural differences. The wife wants to leave the country with her daughter, but her husband has the power to forbid it. The perceptive teenage daughter is caught between her parents, and chooses at first to stay with her father in a desperate attempt to keep her parents together. The wife goes off to live with her own parents, leaving her estranged husband with the problem of how to obtain day care for his father, who suffers from dementia. The woman who is hired for this task through a casual arrangement proves unable to cope. There is a fascinating scene in which, concerned for the old man who is incontinent, she phones an imam for advice as to whether it is permissible for her to help her charge to clean himself. The husband returns home to find the flat empty and his father in a state, and matters turn violent when the carer comes back without a good explanation. In the ongoing dispute, the complexity of the issues is clearly shown, with right on both sides, and one's sympathies are divided.This is a tightly plotted and entertaining drama, despite the at times grim theme - a kind of middle eastern update of Kramer versus Kramer (American film about a divorced couple with Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman) and in my view much deeper. We are thrust into the midst of some very convincing dramatic exchanges. The Iranian justice system is intriguing as we see the various protagonists crammed into an office, arguing loudly with each other and with the official whose task it is to decide on what seems an arbitrary basis who should be charged and who should be held in jail pending trial. Although harsh, Iranian society seems in some ways more deeply moral and concerned with fairness and right versus wrong than our own. Ironically, as in Britain, the better educated and wealthier couple's rights win out over those of the poorer family.""Separation"" is not just a drama with an appeal which crosses cultural boundaries. It also increased my understanding of Iranian culture and deserves to be more widely viewed to break down our ill-founded prejudices."
46,A Separation,10,2 March 2012,A brilliant movie!,"This is one of the very rare movies that manages not to paint the world in black and white. It shows how the personal situations of different individuals as well as their emotions can lead to actions that they later regret. There is no good or bad, the characters are just human, and in their way they are all right and wrong at the same time. I very much appreciated the complete lack of stereotypes. The story is a very contemporary one about a divorce, like it could have happened anywhere in the world. Being set in Iran the movie gives an insight into everyday life there, but lets the viewer absorb the impressions without pointing finger. To me it corresponded very well to the Iran I have seen."
47,A Separation,7,30 December 2011,So far the best foreign movie in 2011,"I just saw this movie and I highly recommend it. The way the story was going totally unexpected and many surprises occur throughout the movie. There is a lot of dialogue and over talking, which makes it a bit hard to read the subtitles, but you will manage to understand regardless. The story of the movie is a one that everyone, no matter what the background is, will relate it. The acting in the movie was extraordinary, all the women and girls did a great job, both young and old were superb.The movie is also educational, since you will get a glimpse of how Iranians are living their lives in Iran. The religious, societal, and family issues that they go through. Also, what I liked in the movie is that it had nothing to do with the Iranian politics, but of course you will be able to see how the regime affects the people."
48,A Separation,9,17 January 2012,Strong Iranian film,"¨What is wrong is wrong, no matter who said it or where it's written.¨ Critics have been raving about this Iranian film and after finally getting the chance to see it I can see why they were so pleased with this social drama. It is a very well told story with great performances. Filmed mostly with a hand-held camera, the movie feels very authentic and real. At moments you forget you are seeing a movie, and feel like you are watching a real family with real problems. Iranian director, Asghar Farhadi, knows what he is doing and delivers a near perfect film. He captures a glimpse of an Iranian family and lets the camera tell the story. What at first seems like a movie that's going to focus on the separation between the husband and wife later becomes more complicated and interesting when the main character is charged for murder and we see the way the Iranian law system works. We also experience how the entire situation affects the different members of the family. I also liked the final reveal near the ending as I wasn't sure how the story was going to pay out, and it worked really well. Most foreign films tend to deal with social issues since these movies are cheaper to make and they don't count with the costly productions that Hollywood films have to create spectacular visual effects and action scenes. That is why more emphasize is put on the storytelling in order to capture the viewer's attention. The storytelling here is the center of the movie and we truly care for what the characters are going through. We can relate to these people despite their different culture and beliefs. They have to deal with similar issues that most families need to deal with, and that is what makes A Separation a universal movie.Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are getting a divorce because Simin wants to leave Iran and find better job opportunities in another country. They have been waiting over a year for their Visa to go through and once they finally get it Nader decides he doesn't want to leave the country because he has to take care of his father (Ali Asghar Shahbazi) who has Alzheimer. Simin won't leave without her daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), but she wants to stay with her father since she knows that if she stays her mother won't leave. Simin ends up moving to her mother's home and since she's gone Nader has to find someone that can take care of his father while he is at work. He hires a pregnant lady named Razieh (Sareh Bayat) who stays at the house while he's off to work. Razieh is very religious and she doesn't feel like she should be working at an adult male's home, but she has to take the job since her husband, Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), is in debt and without work. One day Nader arrives home only to find the door locked and no one answering. He finds a spare key and enters his home only to find his father lying on the floor tied to the bed. Nader unties his father and gives him respiration and fortunately he survives. In the middle of the chaos, Razieh returns to the house and Nader is so furious that he pushes her out of the door. The next day Nader is called to court since Razieh loses her baby and wants to charge him for murder. This is where the mystery of what really happened begins as both sides try to prove their point.A Separation recently won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign film and rightfully so because it's a powerful film. It will probably be one of the nominated films for the Oscars, and as much as I liked this movie I still didn't find it as powerful as other foreign films I've seen such as City of God, The Prophet, and The Secret in Their Eyes. This Iranian film is still great, but I don't think it would be on my top 5 list of the year. It's still a strong and memorable movie and probably the best foreign film of the year. The performances are also really great, I really loved these characters and they had real good material to work with. For those people who think everything in Iran has to do with terrorism, then they should definitely see this movie and realize that most Iranians are just normal citizens like everyone else. The one thing that director Farhadi does seem to criticize about his country is the way that the law system works. There aren't any lawyers involved, every man has to defend himself in front of a judge like if they were having a normal conversation. A Separation is a great film and no wonder it became the first ever film to win three Bears from the Berlin International Film Festival. This film is worth checking out, and I would really like to see Farhadi's previous work since I wasn't familiar with him before this.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
49,A Separation,10,31 March 2011,best Iranian movie so far,"i think Farhady is best known for his way of directing but in this movie his storytelling has improved a lot just like about Elli and the Wednesday fireworks he deals with the middle class society and raises a big question:when you know that you have done something wrong will admit it and take the blame and pay the price of it or will lie and live on as if nothing has ever happened?the main character (Nader)keeps telling every one including his daughter that you should be telling the truth even if its not in your benefit but does he do so?i say no.When faced with the real dilemma he does not choose the right path and even encourages his daughter to lie for him(though he never says the words but in a way teaches the girl to lie).He goes on and on about how much he cares about his father (and in a way his whole family ,his daughter as well)but his willing to rip his family apart just to prove that his right. The question remains,does everyone follow his own advice?or it means to much trouble?"
50,A Separation,9,26 February 2012,A powerful realistic drama about arguments and pride and how they can easily get the best of us.,"'A SEPARATION': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) This year's likely winner for Best Foreign-Language film at the Academy Awards (in which it's also nominated for best original screenplay) is this Iranian drama about a couple living in Iran who separate and the complicated problems that arise because of it. It was written, produced and directed by Asghar Farhadi. The movie stars Peyman Maadi and Leila Hatami as the couple and Sareh Bayat and Sarina Farhadi in key supporting roles. The movie is an all around grade A production and a powerful realistic drama about arguments and pride and how they can easily get the best of us.The movie revolves around Nader (Maadi) and Simin (Hatami) and their 11-year-old daughter Termeh (Farhadi). The three live in Tehran with Nader's father who has Alzheimer's disease. Simin wants to travel abroad in order to provide better opportunities for Termeh but Nader feels obligated to stay in Iran and take care of his father. So when Simin leaves home Nader is forced to hire a caregiver named Razieh (Bayat) to take care of his dad while he's at work. Many more complications and arguments arise when Razieh is hurt on the job.The movie is said to be an honest and accurate depiction of life in Iran but I found it to be a very honest and accurate depiction of people and life in general, showing how similar we all really are. The disagreements that so easily get out of control in this movie are ones I think we can all relate to. The characters in this movie represent so many in many ways. That's where I think the movie's biggest strength is. The acting, writing and directing are all top notch and combine together to give a very real portrayal of human life and how we all interact with each other.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj0JA1sJBzw"
51,A Separation,,9 March 2012,"Iranian Rashomon, so packed with issues that you can discuss it for days","The proliferation of major and minor awards is no result of chance, but well earned. Almost as real-life as a documentary, ""A separation"" deals out more issues than you can think of  family relationship across three generations, social class separation, religion, politics, human frailty, selfishness and forgiving, tolerance and intolerance, rigid stubbornness and insecurity.the list goes on  through efficiently constructed scenes and clear, effective dialogue. The performance of the cast is uniformly excellent.The outwardly somewhat complicated plot and proliferation of characters can be deconstructed first into two core families of three. Middle-class Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami), husband and wife, plus 11-year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) comprise one. Working-class Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) and Razieh (Sareh Bayat) with a 4-year-old daughter is the other. The link is through Razieh being employed as a domestic assistant to look after Nader's dementia-inflicted father when Simin moves out to her parent's in protest of Nader's refusal to emigrate, placing the aged father's welfare before the daughter's future. A seasoned moviegoer would immediately see the vast dramatic potentials in this family for the script-writer and director.With the other family, the predicaments are familiar: a husband who cannot control his temper fails repeatedly to hold on to a job (remember ""Airport""?) and turns anti-society, debtors constantly on their back, and a long suffering wife who is pregnant. The key plot element, the conflict between these two families, starts with Razieh's negligence on the job and escalates to her losing the baby and charging Nader with murder, as the foetus is more than a certain number of days old.While I mentioned Rashomon in my summary line, there is no contrived, convoluted plot. The gradual revelation of what really happened is matter-of-fact. The plot line is not the end, but only the means to anchor all the various human issues I mentioned. Throughout the movie, you'll be completely absorbed in the hopes and fears, aspirations and woes of these people, not because they are melodramatic but because they are convincing. And you'll talk about it long after the movie ends.This latest Oscar Best Foreign Film is a must-see."
52,A Separation,9,28 April 2011,The best product of Recent Cinema,"Asghar Farhadi amazes me. When I first heard about ""About Elly"" I wasn't sure what it was going to be like but when I sat down to watch the movie I was literally blown away by the writing, acting and the direction of course. Still, I wasn't sure if he could repeat the same success with ""Nader and Simin"" and yet again I was blown away.""Nader and Simin"" is more than anything an experience, pretty much like 10 by Abbas Kiarostami was but with acting taking the place of realism and striking even more powerful. The plot for me didn't matter, what did, was the settings, the court scenes and how fluent and realistic every character's actions or dialogs were. You feel for every character, you laugh and cry with all of them and still you may just as well hate them for no reason at all.There's also the often presented questions with no answers: Who's the girl going to choose? Who took the money? Who's to blame? and ... and the answer is clear as hell, who cares? As long as there's a great story to tell and an amazing two hours to spend on a splendid product, who really cares?All in all, I have to admit that this is cinema at its best and this movie isn't at least nominated for an Oscar for foreign language film then I'm definitely losing my whole faith in the Academy Awards for ignoring such a wonderful installment only because of political beliefs."
53,A Separation,5,24 May 2017,Depressing,"An ambiguous miserable soap opera. As a study of how people behave, it's possibly a fairly accurate depiction. Everyone lies, everyone has an agenda, poor people do things they must in order to survive... and get taken advantage of, in the process compromising themselves, becoming less than their better selves and becoming less autonomous and more attached to the absurdity of religion... same story told again and again. And wealthier people appearing to be educated and beyond reproach are quite willing to be less than their better selves for the ends to justify the means.A man hires a woman desperate for work. In order to pay off her husband's creditors this heavily pregnant women is supposed to take care of an old man who is overweight and struck with Alzheimer.Less about a separation, and more about the children jammed between parents and how they must cope with, and make decisions based on the stupidity they see all around them.If you have issues with religion and its inherent moronic side; with class inequality and its, well, inequality, or the tragedy of how children must cope in the messy cauldron caused by adults, probably not the movie for you.I found this well acted, scripted well but a depressing pot boiler of miscommunication and angst that is the cause of most human drama played worldwide daily. Utterly depressing and annoying with no clear ending. Some nonsense about stolen money which is later admitted by the arrogant buffoon of a father to never have been stolen... lots of bickering, unhappiness pouring out at you like a stream of vomit...on and on and on... yuk."
54,A Separation,9,3 March 2012,Truth and Dare,"This film is highly recommended.Divorce is always a messy business. People who once loved now lash out at each other with an intensity that rivals the pain, hate tends to envelop each word, and every family members' lives are inexplicably changed. Sometimes time can heal the suffering and happiness can eventually be found, but that seems the rarest of commodities. In this year's well-earned Oscar-winning foreign film, A Separation, that possibility seems almost non-existent. Throughout our world, we rely on the court system to handle the legal and monetary matters and are left to personally handle the emotional toll as we access the damage we inflict on each other. Laws are made to protect its citizens from harm or injustice. And yet, sometimes these statutes have an opposite polarizing effect on its people. There was a time, in our own country, when women could not vote, alcohol was illegal, and education was deemed separate but equal. ( Granted, there still are disparities in our legal system, when same sex marriage is not sanctioned, woman's rights are again being questioned, and immigration laws are punishable, but let's try to stay on task. ) Any country must amend the laws and change its archaic rules if its society is to prosper. In this multi-layered drama, the Iranian court system is taken to task in a film so innovative and neo-realistic in its direct approach to a common problem experienced by many families. A Separation presents authentic characters with all of their human weaknesses suddenly thrown into dire situations that totally engage the movie-going audience in such a honest and straight forward way. In Asghar Farhadi's gripping Iranian import, the law sets up deliberate legal and moral repercussion in its separate but unequal treatment of a family caught in an unjust and emotional dilemma.Nader ( Peyman Maadi ) and Simin ( Leila Hatami ) are faced with problems that are tearing apart their marriage. Simin wants a better life for her daughter, Termeh, and wants to move away to another country while her disagreeing husband needs to care for his father who suffers from Alzheimers. Their break-up is inevitable, but the decision to separate leads to some devastating results. Nader hires a day nurse, Razieh ( Sareh Bayet ), an abused and deeply devout woman, to care for his father while he is working, never telling her hot- tempered husband Hodjat ( Shahab Hosseini ) of her plan. This arrangement leads to further complications amid the many secrets and lies compounded by everyone involved. Their strong personal will to survive a legal system bereft of any justice becomes a central issue in this compelling courtroom drama.These are flawed people faced with life and death decisions. The choices made by them have far-reaching cultural, political, and religious ramifications. Director Farhadi agilely sets up the plot and then purposely structures his film so that the viewer never really knows the exact circumstances that leads to the compounding of the issue at hand. His intricate screenplay has a Rashomon influence, as he edits the film to only show fragments of the case from differing points of view. This tends to complicate the viewer's own point of view as certain facts are left obscure and deliberately left to skew the outcome. ( There are some logistical factors that remain unexplained too.)That said, A Separation is still a thought-provoking and hard-hitting film, impeccably acted by its cast, especially Maadi as the proud and stubborn patriarch. Special kudos to Hatami and Bayet as the women caught up in this male dominated culture, trying to make sense of their purpose while protecting the children they love. The child actors also bring a wonderful naturalness to their roles. Farhadi's literate script examines their plight and ponders the ethical and religious connotations that weigh on its characters as they deal with truths and half-truths that, in turn, destroy each of their lives. Sometimes, the truth doesn't always set you free. A Separation is a must-see for any seriously-minded moviegoer. GRADE: B+NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com"

These questions are formed in viewers' minds and it's remarkable that The answers are not direct and fulsome , in other words you can see a gray layer over the whole movie(There's no pure right and wrong) 2.The actors are completely into their roles and they represent classic roles so that they take viewers in the movie with themselves . ""Asghar Farhadi"" has been really cautious about all the roles and he's been able to depict the scenes very naturally and believably .3.The pace is normal , the scenes don't bore you or flash too quickly , and it should be considered as one of it's many good points that make it a brilliant movie ."
56,A Separation,9,13 February 2012,Best Movie of 2011?,"Iranian writer/director Asghar Farhadi's A Separation is one of the best films, if not the best, of 2011. I totally loved it, and it moves to the top of my list of best films of the year. It's been nominated for two Oscars (best foreign film and best original screenplay), having already won a slew of other awards. A Separation is a small, carefully observed, exquisitely rendered motion picture about  well, it's about a lot of things.The title refers, most explicitly, to one of these: the depiction of an apparently irreconcilable disagreement between Nader, a thirty-ish bank officer, and his wife, Simin; their resulting separation; and the effect of all this on their family, including most particularly their daughter, Termeh, who's caught in the middle. The picture presents one of the most honest portrayals of a family's marital dissolution ever portrayed in a feature film. As a matrimonial lawyer, I know a little something about this.His wife gone, Nader hires a caretaker, Razieh, to take of his dad, while he is at work and Termeh is at school. Whereas Nader and Simin are educated, secular and solidly middle class (or perhaps upper middle class), Razieh is none of those things; her husband is an unemployed cobbler, she is devoutly religious, and she comes from a different cultural milieu entirely. Everyone speaks Farsi, but really, they do not speak the same language. Within a few days, Nader comes home early to find his father tied to his bed and Razieh absent. When she returns, an argument ensues, during which Razieh's reticence about the reason for her absence and Nader's angry refusal to allow her the opportunity to explain, culminates in her being fired. Nader has to literally throw her out of his flat. A lawsuit ensues.Communication and its limits are a major theme of the movie. Without honest, open communication, there can be no connection and no understanding, only misunderstanding. Misunderstanding breeds conflict, which impedes honesty and communication. Pretty soon there are multiple levels of separation: within the nuclear family, and by extension within the extended family of relatives, friends, and acquaintances (even Termeh's teacher gets drawn in); between the white collar and the blue-collar classes, between the secular and the devout and between people and their government (limited here to the judicial system  for political reasons).The film opens with Simin and Nader in domestic court, where each explains why his/her position is the most reasonable. Faryabi keeps the magistrate offscreen - the camera is where he would be - so the couple seem to be pleading directly to us. Later, there are several scenes at the courthouse, where we eavesdrop on the proceedings between Razieh and her husband on one hand versus Nader on the other. Accusations fly wantonly; Razieh's husband, a hothead, gets disturbingly yet credibly hotheaded; and the hearing officer, sweating, in shirtsleeves, tries to hold it together while seeking to winnow out the truth. But which truth, whose truth? From the start and throughout this perceptive and moving picture, our sympathies for the characters constantly shift, because we are getting acquainted with basically good people, acting badly at times, but trying to do the best they can under trying circumstances. There are no heroes, no villains. None of the characters are perfect, all are wholly believable. The actors dissolve into their roles in the most naturalistic way, so we forget they are actors.The themes of separation and impaired communication are augmented by the creative cinematography. Conversations occur through half-closed doors, characters are viewed through panes of glass, or in enclosed vehicles. We get extreme close ups of faces struggling with awful dilemmas: what do I say? Do I tell the truth? The whole truth? Then there is the haunting, heartbreaking final scene, back at the courthouse. - spoiler alert - Mom and Dad can't agree on custody. They both sorely love their daughter. The magistrate has asked Termeh if she has made a decision who she wants to live with. She has, but she doesn't want to say so in their presence. It's just too painful. Nader and Simin are asked to leave the room. They go out into the hall. They do not speak. Simin sits on one side of a glass partition, Nader is on the other. They wait. Eventually, the credits roll.Through the lives of these characters, through a relatively simple narrative, with the aid of an honest screenplay and great acting, photography and direction, Faryabi demonstrates a compassionate understanding of human behavior and the forces with which ordinary people sometimes must struggle, navigating between empathy and self-righteousness, principle and compromise, self-protection and honesty, anger and compassion, love and duty. He has given us a moving, thought provoking, intelligent masterpiece.For us in the US, there is another dimension of A Separation to savor. After months and years of political conversation about the dangers of a nuclear Iran, and the extremism of the Islamic regime running that country, we tend to forget that this is a country of people. And these people, it turns out are remarkably like us, notwithstanding their government. Startling so, to my sensibility. They drive cars, they have jobs, they dress like us (notwithstanding the mandatory headscarves for the ladies and the occasional birqa), the furnishings in their flats and public buildings look pretty 'Western.' At several moments, we get glimpses of 'the people' of Iran as a community. When the caretaker, Razieh, almost faints on a bus, the reaction of the community is remarkably supportive, trying to help in an any way they can. Even the magistrate in the legal action between the families shows signs of compassion, constrained though he is by Shariah law. I do not know what I was expecting, but somehow this glimpse into urban Iranian life and of the Persian people was a fascinating and reassuring bonus."
57,A Separation,10,28 January 2012,Superb Iranian domestic drama and suspense thriller deserves all the accolades heaped upon it!,"With the release of the superb 'A Separation', director Ashgar Farhadi has done much to open peoples' eyes that Iran is a much more complex society than has generally been perceived in the West. The film's title might lead one to believe that this story is merely about the separation of a husband and wife but it's much more than thatat times I felt I was watching a Hitchcock-like thriller, with all the attendant twists and turns associated with the suspense master himself.In a sense, the separation between Nader and Simin, the secular middle class couple who are seen at the beginning of the film in a divorce court, is the catalyst for all the stunning developments to come. Because the judge rejects Simin's application for a divorce, she returns to her parents' home and leaves Nader, along with their eleven year old daughter Termeh (magnificently played by Sarina Farhadi, the director's real-life daughter) to care for Nader's Alzheimer's-stricken father.Nader is the film's protagonist and should be seen as an admirable and complex character. Some may view him as foolhardy to continue taking care of his father, virtually on his own, but his decision is a testament to the strength and nobility of his character. Note the subtle scene where he orders Termeh to return a tip to a gas station attendant, after the attendant fails to perform a required service, thus teaching his daughter not only the value of hard work but also to be assertive (especially in a society where women are not always encouraged to be like that).The film's antagonist, Razieh, is also a complex character. She shows up at Nader's house with her young daughter, having agreed to work as a domestic, taking care of Nader's father. Razieh is from a lower middle class background, dresses in a conservation Chador and ends up consulting a religious phone hot line, asking for advice whether it's against Muslim religious law to wash Nader's father. Even when the Iman tells her that she's permitted to do so, she understandably has a very hard time performing such unsavory work.Nonetheless, Razieh uses remarkably poor judgment by tying up Nader's father and leaving the home to keep a doctor's appointment. Perhaps it's her unfamiliarity with elderly people stricken with Alzheimer's, that leads her to believe that such a senile man will be okay on his own, while she leaves the home. It's also quite understandable that Nader ends up quite upset to find Razieh gone and his father on the floor, hardly breathing. When Razieh returns, he berates her, discovers money missing and concludes that she was responsible for stealing it. What Nader wasn't aware of, was that Simin had earlier paid movers with the money. Now it's Razieh's turn to become upset as she's been falsely accused of theft and then makes things worse in Nader's eyes, by requesting her day's pay. We break into Act 2, when Nader pushes Razieh out the door, leading her to accuse him of causing the miscarriage of her baby.The ensuing complications are too detailed to list here but let me say that director Farhadi has done a masterful job in chronicling the day to day operations of the Iranian justice system. Again, it's a nuanced portrait of a Judge who seems almost bored by being forced to sit through one conflicting domestic situation after another as well as revealing an attitude of inflexibility in applying the vagaries of the Iranian penal code. Nonetheless, it's not a complete kangaroo court, as investigations do seem to be ordered and there is a modicum of an attempt to ascertain the true facts.While we do learn Nader is found to have lied to the court when he denies knowing that Razieh was pregnant, even Termeh realizes that sometimes 'white lies' are necessary and perjures herself before the Court, to ensure that her father doesn't go to prison and his life is not ruined.Equally fascinating is Razieh's husband Hodjat's machinations in his quest for justice, which ends up more like a thirst for revenge. Hodjat represents the dark side of the Iranian populace. He's a hothead, who will take extra-judicial steps including threatening Termeh's tutor, who testified in Nader's defense. Hodjat is so menacing that the tutor even changes her testimony which jeopardizes Nader's case. Hodjat still is operating under the mistaken belief that his wife's claims are legitimate but when we learn that Razieh lost the baby because she was hit by a car (while outside looking for Nader's father who had wandered out of the house), Razieh's honor becomes much more questionable than that of her husband. After all, Razieh refuses to swear on the Koran, not because she's ashamed of accusing an innocent man, but because she fears that by testifying falsely, Allah may seek revenge on her and her daughter for her sins.It's up to Simin to finally convince Nader to compensate Razieh's family. While Nader earlier casts Simin as someone who too easily runs away from difficult conflicts, he realizes the only way out is to compromise and pay compensation to Razieh's family. Of all the characters in the film, Simin is perhaps the most thinly drawn. Why does she want to leave Iran? Is it because she's tired of taking care of Nader's father? We don't find out that much about her but when she and Nader argue, the scenes are electric.Justice is finally served when Razieh refuses to swear on the Koran. As the legitimacy over Razieh's initial accusation and Nader's debt to her family is resolved, the subplot concerning the pending custody of Termeh is not. We're left to guess which parent Termeh chooses to live with at film's end.'A Separation' is a superb film which, if it only could be, should not only be nominated for Best Foreign language film but for the Academy's 'Best Picture' as well."
58,A Separation,8,27 June 2012,We are more similar than dissimilar.,"It would be very easy to taint this film with an opinion outside that of its origin. The West is not in any position to judge. Yet it is beyond race, it is beyond sexism, it is beyond religion, as all are mere positions of a shadow, shifting, reaching, shrinking, neither right nor wrong. This is a film, who core relates to a basic principle, that of responsibility. This factor is a disputed trait the world over, no matter the origin. Withhold your judgments, consider the consequences for those involved, embrace humanity, and understand where the decision making process comes from. Sure we might do it differently, but would the end result be any different? Fractured? Stripped. Shorn of truth. It doesn't make it any less right.If anything, this film demonstrates our common humanity. Sure the rules aren't the same but our needs are. It may be titled a separation, but it may be more appropriate to called it a universal unification.We are more similar than dissimilar. A poignant, challenging piece of cinema."

60,A Separation,10,3 March 2012,Who is right? Who is wrong? Isn't that the cause of all killings?,"This movie is an absolute success from the cultural point of view. First of all U have to understand that making movies in Iran is NOT easy! Lack of funding is the main reason, and then the red tape with all the government prohibitions and censorship.This movie is great! Is the greatest in Iranian movie making history, and it's great because of it's plot, acting, and cinematography.. U can compare this movie to ""Crash"" another great movie set in US. Giving different perspectives of everyone's life, and difficulties to make it in a society that is ""sick."" Please don't mix politics with this movie and it's success... This is not a political movie... It's a plain story of a society that is in pain. You keep wondering throughout the movie, whose fault it is? Who is right? Who is wrong? This is a movie about righteousness! Honor! Family values! Money! But, who is right? I let you decide..."
61,A Separation,,29 February 2012,"Wow, what a great movie!!!!","no wonder this iranian film would have won the Oscar for best foreign movie. this movie in my opinion is even better than the best movie of 2011 that won the Oscar. the screenplay, the dialog, the directing, the camera, the sound track....everything and all in all, are simply outstanding and near perfect! as to the movie itself, after watching it, i think that the husband and the father is absolutely innocent. he's also a great father to his daughter and a great son to his mentally as well as physically disabled father. the daughter is the typical good young lady that only a great fatherhood could be endowed. as the to the mother, well, i think that she's the sole cause and consequence of all the bad things. to me, she is also a selfish woman, cold wife and loveless mother. she would abandon everything in her life in Iran just for a visa that is difficult to get. well, that's just my impression and conclusion after watched this great film. as to all the actors and actresses, including the disabled father-grandfather, played a role in this film, i have to say they did impeccable and convincing performances. i can never imagine that a family dispute would cause such tremendous chain reaction to lot of people. i also have to say, i've seen many iranian movies as best i could have found, that the iranian common people are somehow better people than us. i will never buy anything that the government tried so hard to trash that country and its people."
62,A Separation,10,14 January 2012,God makes movies??,"You can tell from the very opening of the movie that this one is going to be one of the best you'll ever see. In my case, it is not ""one of"", but ""the best movie"" I've seen till date (synechdoche, New york being my previous favourite) and I'm sure you understand how hard it is to pick ""ONE"" movie from a whole lives worth of watching. I'm sure everyone will appreciate the movie but there are so many levels at which you can participate in your journey through this movie and I'm pretty sure not all will get it fully. But everyone will understand that its one of those movies they're lucky to watch. Its compelling from the start and if you follow any one character closely, its a different story (movie) depending on whose perception you would like to see. After i watched the movie, and the credits rolled, i suddenly realized that it was only a movie and that everyone was acting. Its too hard to believe ""EVERYONE"" can pull it off like that. The editing and cinematography ties it all together. Its like god wanted to make a movie and took over. Azghar Farhadi has once again done what he always does - Put to shame the bulk of cinema industry world over who think they know cinema."
63,A Separation,10,8 January 2012,An extraordinary film,"I think most people have experienced in life at least once the law of unintended consequences, where a number of moves, seemingly small and harmless in themselves, end up in an explosive and desperate situation when they add up. In this wonderful Iranian drama (I WILL DISCLOSE SOME SPOILERS), Nader and Simin, a middle class, westernized couple in Tehran, are divorcing. Nader, the wife, wants to leave Iran for abroad with their daughter; Simin (an extraordinary performance by Peyman Moaadi) wants to stay to take care of his Alzheimer disease ravaged father. Nader moves out of the house, and to take care of his father, Simin hires Razieh, a religious, working class woman, who is clearly out of her depth in having to take care of an incontinent, senile man. In her second day at work, she leaves for a moment the apartment, leaving the father tied at the bed. Simin soon arrives and finds his father has fallen from bed and is unconscious. Razieh returns, Simin angrily confronts her, he accuses her of negligence in caring for his father and (it turns out falsely) of stealing money, they start arguing and he ends up shoving her from the apartment. She falls and ends up losing her four months pregnancy. When her unemployed husband Hodjat learns of this, he pushes charges of murder toward Simin, and soon there is a huge legal confrontation between the couples. I will not reveal more, but we are less than half ways into the movie, and in the course of the trial, many things would turn out not to be what we supposed at first.Director Ashgar Farhadi intelligently does not take sides, and refrains from portraying one couple as good and the other couple as bad. Nevertheless, I think Western audiences will tend to sympathize with Nader and Simin, whose lives they would find easier to identify with. And Hodjat is such a hothead that is hard to feel any sympathy for him. But almost every character in the movie acts in a very selfish way (starting with Nader, wishing to leave Iran and her family without establishing a good reason). And almost every character would eventually lie to the judge when it fits their need. And it is the working class couple who has suffered the most grievous loss (though whose responsibility this was is not clear until the very end), and it is Simin who is probably the most smug character in the movie, though the movie makes clear that no one meant bad to anyone, and that they ended up up here due to an extraordinarily improbable chain of events."
64,A Separation,9,24 October 2011,A real life drama,"""A Separation"" is a real life drama on the concept of the ""family"" , ""responsibilities"" and the ""people"". No matter where it took place, the movie touches everything in life that we even don't dare to talk about. The scenario is quite a gem that doesn't let you go anywhere, heart & soul.The story is about a man & a woman who're on the edge of separation, having only a girl aged 11 and the man's father with Alzheimer, a pregnant poor woman that tries to take care of him for money & her jobless husband.Things that are already on the edge of a breakdown gets worse with a few more unlucky issues and gets even worse for all.It is the people's behaviour on the consequences that makes you think all about it.Just watch it, no need for any other words....But be prepared on the decision of the 11 year old daughter..."
65,A Separation,9,29 November 2012,"Highly skeptical first 35 minutes, then it lives up to the hype","Well this got a lot of hype. Top 200 movie of all time. Glowing reviews. Something like 96 on Rotten Tomato.But a foreign film and the subject matter didn't' exactly look to be all that exciting. It looked like it had the potential of being a boring politically correct Hollywood foreign film Sundance snoozefest. Subtitles.For the first 35 minutes it sure looked that way. Then things started to get interesting and it was nonstop the rest of the way through.Boy what a great movie this was. Worth every inch the praise it got. Great, great movie.Great acting. Great plot. Seemed very real. Didn't even notice the subtitles."
66,A Separation,9,4 November 2012,"Between caring for a fragile life of the elder and securing a better life for the daughter, the middle-class couple have to make the tough decisions.","This wonderful film is about a middle class family in Iran, of which the middle-aged parents living with a 11-year-old daughter and an elder who suffers Alzheimer's disease. The film starts with a scene of the parents filing for divorce before a judge and ends with the scene of the same setting, except the outcome is different. It's clear that both parents love their daughter, and that they love each other, too. Then why do they want a divorce? And what changed the judge's verdict? The answers to those two questions are simple enough: the mother wants a better life of the next generation; the father doesn't want to abandon the last generation. So that's a clear conflict. And that conflict led to another family in a lower class coming into their life, That's when the story gets truly fascinating. It pushes the two families to the edge. The crisis forces everyone to have a clarity in his or her moral and religious guidance, although the ending scene leaves one question unanswered.It's a brilliant film--simple, powerful, and authentic."
67,A Separation,10,11 March 2012,Move Thee Reviews: The Audience as Judges,"A Separation is a multi-layered, well-acted and engaging drama about the complexity of human morality. Most movies rely heavily on music to evoke emotion, yet A Separation, with only one piece of music in the end credits, is compelling owing to its realism and a spate of moral dilemmas. We, the audience, are forced to serve as judges from beginning to end. (Please note the first scene in which we look at the couple talking to a judge.) Should we leave behind the father with Alzheimer's disease? Are there any circumstances in which lies are morally acceptable? Is it appropriate for parents to encourage their children to lie? Should a teacher shy away from telling the truth? Are there any problems when we behave purely in conformity with our religion? Has justice been done in Iran? As for the maid's miscarriage, whose fault is it? Herself because of her negligence? Her husband who owes people money? Her employer who allows a pregnant woman to work as a maid? Upon the outburst of the daughter's pent-up emotions, a tear rolled down my cheek. She is just a little girl whose parents separate, whose grandfather is sick, whose father is charged with murder, whose schoolmates gossip about her, whose life is threatened. She has tried to unite her family members, whereas she bursts into tears because of her father's stubbornness, which can be interpreted as Iran's conservative regime telling ties to cover its scandals and controlling its people with the use of religion. Her sadness is heartfelt because of the three-dimensional character.The movie is well cast and well acted. Honorable mention goes to Ali-Asghar Shahbazi, Nader's father in the film. Although he is not a trained actor, he gives a very convincing performance. The two daughters, who act naturally, also elicit great sympathy from the audience.Anyway, I highly recommend this beautiful Iran movie to all of you. It will be one of my top five movies in 2012.Spoiler Warning: Please note that the three family members also wear black at the end, which implies the death of the grandfather. However, the gap between Nader and his wife widens, which leads to the final scene."
68,A Separation,10,11 February 2012,8.6.....? Are you kidding me? It deserves a 10.,"Those who think that movies can't change lives, should watch this film. Its one of the most beautifully crafted movie ever made in cinema's history. It stands there right at the top with The Shawshank Redemption as my all time favorite film. The lead actor ""Peyman Maadi""... OMFG what an actor he is. He deserves a lot more recognition and appreciation world wide. He's a gem of an actor. I am an Indian, but i am an huge fan of international cinema including Hollywood. I have seen many bollywood actors with great acting prowess like Amitabh Bacchan, Aamir Khan, Shahrukh Khan etc... I have seen Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Sean Penn... who are powerhouse performers. But this guy... He can give all of them a run for their money. Iranian Cinema wont be the same after this movie. Its a one time experience which should not be missed. If you want to do a favor to yourself and your family this summer, go and watch A Separation. I promise you'll not be the same person after watching this."
69,A Separation,9,23 February 2012,more fantastic in repeated viewing than the first one !,"What can i say this is absolutely a fantastic movie ....... all what i can say if you don't watch this one you will lose a fine piece of art . i gave it at first viewing 9 of 10 , i was hesitated about giving it 10, but on the second one i asked my self some questions : isn't it great ? , isn't directing is great ? , isn't acting great ? , does it have any goofs ?!!!!!!! and the answer to all of those questions was (no!) , this movie is flawless ..... it is very simple , very real even you wont be able to recognize that it is a movie if you don't see the title (A Separation) and the names of actors and the rest of stuff !!Hence , i have changed my vote to 10 (because it deserves it) i wont give it 9 for a reason that i couldn't find. Don't waste your time in reading reviews , do yourself a favor and watch this movie , for my humble opinion its highly recommended , it have only the chance to dislike those who don't appreciate fine art."
70,A Separation,9,1 February 2012,"While not especially pleasant viewing, it's a very complex film--the sort that will get you and your friends talking.","Over the years, I have watched perhaps thousands of international films. And, I've come to be impressed by the films of three countries--France, Japan and, surprisingly, Iran. In fact, although I've seen far fewer Iranian films than either Japanese or French, the Iranian films have always been exceptional...always. Their track record with films you can see here in the States is amazing. Part of it is because the nation has produced Majid Majidi--a truly brilliant filmmaker who, oddly, has only received on Oscar nomination and no wins. Yet, easily, he could have won several times with such brilliant films as ""Chidlren of Heaven"", ""The Color of Paradise"", ""The Willow Tree"" and ""Baran"". I have also seen several other wonderful film by other Iranian directors. So, I was quite interested in seeing ""A Separation"" when it arrived at a local theater. And, I am glad I had a chance to see it.The film begins with a man and wife both seeing a judge (or more like a referee) to discuss a divorce. The wife wants to leave Iran (exactly why is never discussed, by the way--an interesting omission) but the husband is adamant--he won't leave his father, as the father has Alzheimer's. This is an odd reason to want a divorce and as the audience knew nothing about the family, it was easy to dislike the wife and side with the husband--especially since they have a daughter who is in the middle. But the wife insists--she WILL leave whether he divorces her or not.Most of the rest of the film centers on the husband. You have to feel for the guy--his wife insists on leaving, his father is in the mid-late stages of the disease and he is having a devil of a time finding someone to care for the man. His prayers seem to be answered when he finds a woman willing to watch him--and at the price he can afford. However, this is early in the film and there is LOTS to come. I'd say more about the plot, but there are so many surprises, I'd rather just leave it to you to see yourself.n The film is great to watch because there are so many surprises and so many situations where people are faced with very tough choices and yet they seem to make the wrong ones again and again--all due to stubbornness. Such simple things like apologizing or even talking out problems--all these seem beyond people. And, in the process, two children from two separate families are stuck in the middle--with HUGE pressures put on them by their parents. As a result of all this, I can guarantee that it's a film that will get you thinking and have a strong emotional impact. It's also a great film to see with friends because I could easily see the film stimulating a ton of discussion afterwords. Intelligent and very complex--the only reservation I have is that the film is unrelentingly sad and tough to watch. I could imagine some viewers just tiring of all this, as it's like an extended Bickerson's skit--without any jokes or levity--just anger, horrible decisions, selfishness and isolation. Sad but profound."
71,A Separation,9,12 November 2011,A Good One,"A Separation is a pretty decent movie, Very well made! The performances are brilliant by the entire cast. The story is not very focused on the TOPIC but its done on purpose, to get the attention of the audience. ""ugly truth,sweet lies"".....The story is pretty interesting and the script is also written wisely.The movie has a limited budget but it is exceptional business all over the world.... No doubt it will be getting attention in the award season and I hope it gets better recognition. The best part of the movie is its end. Its painful and heartbreaking ...... and that is where I got the idea of the movie when I thought of every thing as a child and I was glad they ended it this way...7.5 by me .... very good movie."
72,A Separation,10,14 October 2012,intimate and epic,"A title can sometimes have multiple meanings or significance and this is the case for 'A Separation'.The first meaning is purely narrative and is illustrated boldly by the opening shot of a couple before a judge divorcing. The second meaning relates to the effect this will have on their daughter, who will be separated from one or other of her parents and more importantly from the family unit she has always known. The mother also wishes to leave the country and will need her husband's permission to take their daughter. This is another imminent separation, a cultural estrangement, a break from one's nation of origin. Their daughter is also an adolescent and facing the separation between childhood and adulthood. Class separation forms the rest of the story when the break-up of the central protagonists marriage leads to a series of unfortunate events involving a low-class family.In fact, the theme of separation is almost obsessively imprinted throughout this film, and yet its emotional honesty and dynamic immediacy transcend mere theme. Moreover, as entertainment, 'A Separation' has the intensity and energy of a Hollywood thriller or classical courtroom drama such as '12 Angry Men'.The skill displayed in terms of film-making is never less than brilliant. In the choice of camera positioning, which uses foreground obstructions to spy on the action from a distance, the viewer is always implicated emotionally in the realistic twists and turns of the story which constantly arise from the characters. The acting is faultless and brimming with truth and emotion.Cinema has reached a surprising and unexpected peak in the modest form of an intimate family drama from Iran. The highest of praise has been earned. Anyone looking for something truly great will find it here."
73,A Separation,9,19 June 2012,breathtaking!,"i was left speechless after watching this film..this movie puts the audience in the seat of a juror who has to pass a fair judgment for a complex case of human values, adherence to one's core principles, and setting basic priorities in life, which here becomes unusually tough...this is no thriller, but i was on the edge of my seat for two full hours...this is no horror movie, but it gave me goosebumps...this is no romantic movie, but i fell in love with the plot and all the characters involved..each character is thoughtfully well-defined, and everyone play their parts to perfection.. this is a classic example of intense film making...asghar farhadi & the entire crew, take a bow!!!"
74,A Separation,10,21 February 2012,Shades of Gray in a Black and White World,"A complex and blisteringly intense screenplay distinguishes this Iranian film about the path of destruction a rancorous and failing marriage can leave in its wake.There are no good guys or bad guys in ""A Separation,"" and there are certainly no easy answers. The movie tempts us with easy answers at first, suggesting that characters can readily be put into types when we first meet them, only to show us how quick we are to judge when things we learn later on, both about the people and about the things that happen to them, plunge us into shades of gray.There is a lot of plot in ""A Separation."" Basically good people do bad things -- or if not bad, at least selfish or stupid things. But though there may not be a character in the film who's entirely easy to like (with the exception perhaps of one who sits mostly silently in the center, the biggest victim of the emotional carnage that rages around her), there's likewise no one who it's entirely easy to dislike either. And more than anything, the film suggests that, despite what legal institutions and churches would have us believe, the world for most of us doesn't fall readily into separate boxes for right and wrong.This is easily one of the best movies of the year.Grade: A+"
75,A Separation,10,11 February 2012,"""A Separation"" - Great Achievement Of Iranian Cinema","Iran's Foreign Language Oscar nominee ""A Separation"" is a masterpiece of cinema verite. It possesses a wonderful ""Rashomon""-like quality in which a group of people search for truth amidst a maze of religious veracity, class differences, legalities, family honor and self-interest. In the process Director/Writer Asghar Farhadi does a brilliant job of exposing the issues confronting Iran today without resorting to a political diatribe. His camera doesn't judge it just records everything from the necessity to conform to the whims of petty bureaucrats to the way people are willing to compromise their beliefs when it's expedient to do so. The cast is uniformly great. Leila Hatami is superb as Simin, the disaffected wife who separates from her husband because she wishes to emigrate for the sake of her daughter. Peyman Moaadi is the picture of middle class rectitude as Nader, the husband who insists on remaining in the country because he cannot abandon his Alzheimer's afflicted father. Sareh Bayat is great in the role of Razieh, a deeply religious but desperately poor woman who agrees to care for Nader's father when he's away at work. Shahab Hosseini is Houjat, Razieh's unemployed husband who will be going to prison unless he can obtain some cash to pay off his creditors. Sarina Farhadi is Termeh, the young idealistic daughter of Nader and Simin. Termeh is torn between her father's allegiance to the past and her mother's willingness to break free and seek a new life and isn't that the question facing Iran today. How to retain the best of the past while not totally eschewing modernity."
76,A Separation,9,27 January 2012,Even the silence speaks.,"A seemingly prosaic, mundane drama, A Separation didn't hook many people at first impression, for we're world that goes to the movies for escapism and not to be buffeted under a snow-storm of a ubitquitous quotidian lifestyle, coming straight from the particularly delightful land of Iran. However, this contemporary Iranian drama, when given the chance to, impresses one by its sheer simplicity and strikes a chord of mutual association with the viewers, turning it from a film about family grievances into a microcosm on life itself. The conundrums faced by the characters are not unheard of, their reactions not unexpected and the sequence of events not unforeseen. A Separation is a slice from the pie called everyday-life.Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) decide to call it quits after leading fourteen-years of a married life that has resulted in the birth of a female offspring, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). The woman is clearly more intent on the split of the two. She wants to leave the country, but her husband insists on staying, for he has an Alzheimer's- inflicted father to look after. The court rejects their application, and the impasse provokes Simin to leave Nader and Termeh, to reside with her parents. Being a working man, Nader hires a pregnant, devoutly religious maid, Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to look after the household and his father. However, things soon go awry, resulting in harrowing consequences, as the lives of entirely good people are mercilessly tossed into the storm. The characters, all fabulously acted out, are made up of real flesh-and- blood, who touch a deeply resonating chord. Despite a conflict being the chief motivator for the film, you find it difficult to choose sides, which is a sign of having endearing and genuinely human characters. Unlike most movies, where the central struggle is stretched to unrealistic proportions and the winner can be picked as easily as picking fallen money off the street, A Separation really makes you think as to who deserves your shower of sympathy. And ones you reach that conclusion the movie questions it, repeatedly, till you aren't very certain anymore. The film presents interesting observations on some stark dichotomies - initially one between the poor who work for others and the well-off who pay them. In the highly conservative Iran, the poor lead a desolate life. They must ensure that cleaning a really old man after he has just helplessly wet his pants isn't a sin. She must ask for her husband's permission before she can work at another household. A woman of the middle-class, on the other hand, can abandon her family and live with her parents without a God being there to chastise her. The two lead females, Simin and Razieh, display this contrast with finesse, not merely through their independent lifestyles, but also through the subtleties, like their attire and speaking mannerisms. The other dichotomy is between the judgement of the world from the perspective of an adult and a child. The former knows the ways of the world, and he must act accordingly, regardless of whether it appeals to his conscience or haunts him with guilt. A child, with all his innocence, takes everything at face value, and holds veracity in the utmost importance. This difference is shared by Nader and his daughter, Termeh, and shows just how much things vary with age rather beautifully.The deafening silence in the film resonates of the emptiness prevalent in the lives of each of its characters - a man without his wife, a daughter without her mother, a woman who's lost her child, a jobless man; everyone has a vacuum in their life. What the film captures adroitly, is the functioning of these flawed human beings in the equally scarred world. How we must bend the truth for the greater good, how misunderstandings snowball into disasters, and how a person is often forced to balance too many things on his plate, adopting different roles at different times, because circumstances compel him to do so. Director Asghar Farhadi plants each element into the film with subtle, artistic perfection. There are observations that are passed onto the viewers, despite remaining unsaid. The higlight of the movie remains the fact that A Separation isn't afraid to ask questions. Does an innocuous accident which results in a heart-rendering loss for the poor need to be heavily compensated by the rich perpetrator? I don't even think that question has a right answer."
77,A Separation,10,1 April 2011,the Truth ; against the Pride.. .against the Honour...,"Another story from Iranian master of suspension , Asghar Farhadi , is a gripping moral and social drama set in present-day Iran. The story is not only about men and women, children and parents, justice and religion in today's Iran, but that raises complex and globally relevant questions of responsibility, of the subjectivity and contingency of 'TELLING THE TRUTH', and of how thin the line can be between inflexibility and pride , especially of the male variety , and selfishness and tyranny. Believable performances from the strong cast and crisp photography, hand-held and intimate without ever being jerky, help to seal the package and also make the movie more acceptable. Though the film lasts over two hours,good and fast-moving editing keeps the action tensely involving from start to finish."
78,A Separation,10,1 April 2011,The best Iranian movie,"What makes this film the best I've ever seen in Iran? Is this the story or is this the directing? Maybe it's the acting, or perhaps the editing. I believe this movie has them all. For many years Iranian filmmakers who gained international success were the ones who enjoyed showing a very dark and uncivilized picture of Iran but Asghar Farhady has proved that one can be a successful filmmaker and yet show a more realistic picture of this land and average or working class Iranian families. The story is believable and easy to understand because the characters and situations are something that each one of us have experienced or witnessed sometime in our lives. The actors even the little girl are marvelous, you can feel their emotions and understand their motives every second of the movie and the editing is just superb. You don't see such a great movie everyday, so if you love movies and enjoy movies from all over the world, don't miss the chance to watch it."
79,A Separation,9,28 April 2011,A Situation Drama or a Thriller?,"Farhadi is not only the best filmmaker in Iranian cinema of today, but he is also one of the most important currently active directors in the world. His last film before ""A Separation"", ""About Eli"" (original title: Darbareye Eli), was surely a very good film (perhaps even better than ""A Separation""), but I had understood that I adore it much more than a very good film. After watching ""A Separation"" (Originally known as ""Jodayiye Nader az Simin"", literally means ""The Separation of Nader and Simin""), I know why I respect these films so much.The reason is that Farhadi's movies are not the best of their genre; They seem the only films in their genre. Farhadi, An avant-garde director/auteur, both in content and style, is the inventor of situation dramas which are made in a way that you think you are watching a noir movie or a thriller. His instrument in shocking you is so simple; the reality. If Italian New-realists and Iranian great director, Abbas Kiarostami, used reality to gain the passions of the viewers, Farhadi used it to shock them. Unlike Michael Haneke, who uses the elements of horror and violence in his dramas, Farhadi uses simple daily behaviors of people to terrify the viewers from simple things which are really terrifying; things such as prejudice, anger, distances, egoism, misunderstanding, fear and perhaps the most important one, lie.Perhaps the most interesting thing, is that the reality which is shown by Farhadi, is in a very dramatic and cinematic form. Unlike most of the realist filmmakers, Farhadi is not careless to the power of classic storytelling and film making. Directors such as Kiarostami uses simple camera working and unprofessional actors which sometimes seems a little pretentious. They are genius by their own, but it is a fact that they cannot make realist film if they are forced to make a classic movie. Unlike them, Farhadi works with the usual elements of classic cinema but in a way that you get it so surprisingly real. His mastery in obtaining realistic performances from professional actors, his obsessive attention to the details and his strong attention to camera and editing, are unique.It is not important what is the name of the film, ""A Separation"" or ""About Eli"". Any film of Farhadi is a Unique valuable peace of art. It is the singer, not the song."
80,A Separation,10,12 February 2012,masterful and unblinking description of the incredibly delicate relationships found in any family,"This is a masterful, unblinking, documentary-like description of the incredibly delicate relationships that exist between the members of any family. It should appeal to any adult who has ever a) been married; b) been a parent; c) cared for an elderly person; d) had a serious difference of opinion with a mate; e) tried to be a good person and do the right thing but was thwarted by circumstances and dilemmas; and f) tried to keep the peace at home by telling a white lie that eventually had unintended consequences.In other words, the very mature subject matter and plot should be of interest to just about any adult anywhere in the world. I wonder why Hollywood is unable to do the same. (""The Kids Are All Right"" tried and it was very good but only touched on a tenth of the issues that ""A Separation"" does.)The subtitles were not distracting at all. The sympathetic depiction of Alzheimer's and its effects on all family members is very real, but not at all ""in your face"". When living in Cairo for five years our family resided in three separate apartment buildings similar to those in this film. From time to time we'd hear a domestic dispute underway somewhere in the building, and, because the raised voices were in Arabic, we could only imagine what the dispute was about. This film showed me that what was going on in those Cairo apartments was not much different than what's found in just about any American home at some point in time. Strangely, after the movie ended, the audience remained in their seats and watched the very lengthy credits that are in untranslated Farsi. I think the audience was stunned by the intensity of the story. You will be stunned as well."
81,A Separation,9,12 February 2012,Great Story And Great Work From The Director And Cast To Make this into one of 2011's best.,"At First I Was a bit hesitent to watch this movie,as I've not seen many Foreign Language films in my life,But this movie convinced me to see Foreign Language films more. A Great And Intense Movie along with a great and realistic script and great direction by Writer-Director Asghar Farhadi, boosted by excellent performances from the whole cast to make this into one of the best movies of 2011.The Story is very good and realistic about a married couple who are faced with a difficult decision, with the Wife Simmin(Leila Hatami) wanting to take their child out of the country to improve their child's life, but the Husband Nadar(Peyman Maadi) wanting to stay and look after his father who has Alzheimers. But things go very bad suddenly, when the maid Razieh( Sareh Bayat)looking after Nadar's father accuses Nadar of being the cause of her miscarriage. The Acting from the whole cast is superb and everyone has portrayed their respective roles perfectly, but i thought Sareh Bayet, Peyman Maadi and Leila Hatami were the standout performers in the movie. The Other cast also did a great job,including Nadar's father and The daughter of Nadar and Simmin,and The Husband of Razieh.The Director has done a great job in directing this movie utilizing a great and realistic story written by himself also, helping the actors with their characters, and looking after the other aspects of the film perfectly to make this into one of the best films of 2011.Amazing Thing about this movie is that it practically does'nt have any background music in between the movie, it is probably what it is due to the great acting by the cast, an excellent story and great work from the director.Finally, i think this deserves the Oscar nods it has got and influenced me to see the foreign movies more in my future, and arguebly one of the best movies of 2011.My Rating: 8/10."
82,A Separation,10,10 February 2012,Absolutely Brilliant!,"I would give it 11 out of 10 if possible........I mean this movie is perfect.......Though the story is quite simple the way the complexity arises in this simplicity is superb and engages your mind through the film This movie will someday be listed as one of the greatest films ever to be made.........I mean this movie is flawless and computerization is so good.......Direction, Screenplay and Performances are unquestionably better than great........A MUST WATCH""BRILLIANT PIECE OF CINEMA"" ""Flaw Less"" ""MUST WATCH"" ""So well written"" ""HATS OFF"" watch it at any cost you may miss something really important w o w"
83,A Separation,,26 March 2012,A Terrific Film On So Many Levels,"A Separation (2011) **** (out of 4) As this Oscar-winning drama opens, Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are in front of a judge. The wife is asking for a divorce not because she doesn't love her husband but because she wants to leave the country to try for a better life for their 11-year-old daughter. Simin wants to go as well but not at the present time because he's dealing with his father who has Altiheimerz. While the two are trying to figure out what their future holds, they hire a caregiver (Sareh Bayat) who keeps the news of this job from her husband (Shahab Hosseini) and soon all four are in a courtroom. I won't spoil why they end up in a courtroom but I must say that I was really taken in by this film and it's easy to see why its gaining so much praise. I hate to throw out very strong statements about any movie I've just seen but I do feel this ranks right up there with some of the greatest courtroom movies out there but there's also so much more going on here. There's an entire bit about religious values, moral values and what one little lie can turn into. A SEPARATION tackles so many subjects but director Asghar Farhadi does an amazing job at keeping the film moving with raw emotion and passion. Add on some of the greatest acting you're going to see and you're left with a real masterpiece.What impressed me so much was how raw each of the characters were. Everyone had their secrets, their wants and their reasons for doing what they do yet each of them are so well-written and given so much detail that all of them feel like real humans and not just copies that you see in movies. The screenplay gives each of the principle characters their time in the spotlight to let their emotions out on every subject that comes up and it's just so fascinating to watch how one's statement can lead another to take a situation and run with it. The drama in this film is so tense that at times you feel as if you're watching a thriller because it really does leave you on the edge of your seat as you wonder where it's going to go next. I was literally sitting there hoping that the film would move on because of the tension it was building up to how things would play out. It also doesn't hurt that the four leads, as well as the actors playing the children, give some of the most raw and brutal performances that you're going to see. How these folks were overlooked at the Oscars is a real shame but I've always said that awards really don't mean much in the long run when you turn in great work for generations to come.A SEPARATION is certainly a film that lives up to its hype and I think that even the strongest words by the greatest critic really couldn't do it justice. The movie is a real accomplishment that covers so many different topics and looks at one thing in so many different ways that you really can't help but be impressed. The movie is certainly one of the best of its kind and is a must see."
84,A Separation,10,21 April 2012,"Absolutely captivating, a flawless film","A gripping, dialogue-driven film about the struggles of two Iranian families, A Separation stands out as one of the best films I've seen in at least two or three years. At the onset of the film, we have a family being driven apart by the wife's desire to fulfill the family's dream of moving to the United States while her husband wishes to remain in Iran to care for his senile father. However, we are soon spellbound by an enticing, complex story of interpersonal conflicts, legal wranglings, and just a dash of mystery.Indeed, this is an Iranian film but not necessarily a film about Iran. The themes and questions here are universal, and the storytelling and dialogue transcend culture. That said, Iran provides a unique social milieu for the story to develop, and the setting plays a significant part in the plot itself.There is nothing terribly novel here. In fact, we are faced with age- old questions: What really is the truth? How do you define justice? What sets A Separation apart is how palpable the conflict feels. Like a friend torn between two quarreling mates, you will find yourself constantly pulled in different directions.The movie is flawless. It is superbly acted, written tightly, and expertly directed. I would gladly watch this again."
85,A Separation,10,19 February 2012,Simin was selfish and cold,"I have always been in love with iranian movies since I saw Children of Heaven and The Color of Paradise. I was a little disappointed with Song of Sparrows, from the same director of both mentioned films and neither was I blown away with About Elly, despite its critical acclaim. But A separation reminded me why iranian films are among my favorites.It is true that the director doesn't make it easy for us to take sides, since all characters have their motives and are equally flawed. But I did find myself sympathizing with the husband Nader, which some reviewers called arrogant and stubborn...because he doesn't want to leave his sick father alone and run overseas to start a new life?? Simin on the other hand, seems a pretty selfish and cold woman. I can understand that she was tired of taking care of her father in law, it was quite a difficult job as we can see when Razieh, the new nurse, takes over. But it's obvious there was a bond between the old man and Simin when she was leaving and he gripped her finger and wouldn't let go...How could she not care??Moreover, when Nader was accused of murder, Simin never supported him and used the incident to get their daughter against him. When Razieh confessed to her that the miscarriage was caused by the car accident and not by falling down the stairs, Simin still made him pay the money because she knew it would make it look guilty in front of her daughter and everyone else. That said, I don't think Nader was without fault, he was selfish too...He made their daughter lie for his sake and was very manipulative of her.Finally I want to praise the acting, it was all top notch, but the performance of the actress that plays the nurse Razieh was just spellbinding. She was a desperate, poor woman with a conflicted soul and in pain and she really made sure she showed every detail of that soul to us...WOW."
86,A Separation,10,7 October 2012,Farhadi is a genius,"Great screen play. Perfectly acted. Perfectly directed. Exceptional editing. This is how films should be made.Farhadi's masterpiece makes many Hollywood products look amateurish by comparison. His light touch and insightful direction left me in awe. This is a filmmaker who knows his trade intimately.As for the acting, it is so good it's like watching real life take place. The characters are all completely believable and their actions very human. There are no cookie-cutter protagonists and antagonists here - just people who behave as we all do, by patches light and dark.The final scene is particularly well realized and quite moving.One of the best films I have seen. Period."
87,A Separation,9,31 March 2012,"Morally complex, devastatingly shocking, masterful cinema","An astonishing film. The best film of the last few years bar none and possibly the past decade. Why? Like the film's layered characters and ambiguous motives, it is perhaps difficult to articulate why. Perhaps its the twists are turns that deliver visceral emotional blows; in any culture, any language. Arguably, it combines superlative acting, writing and directing all seamlessly. The events are presented almost like court proceedings that mirror the film so you can make up your own mind about which character to side with, which actions are heroic and those which are deplorable. This is art portraying real life, a culture most of us are foreign to but the human needs are the same, life is grueling and ambiguous. What makes it fascinating is how the characters react, what would you do, do you agree? You are asked to be the jurors of the drama on screen. This is a devastating slow-burn of a drama, one in which the audience must participate. It's intelligent drama, but morally complex and opaque, and brilliant because of it.The magnetic and intriguing story appears straightforward but once you start to feel comfortable and know where the story is heading, prepare for some shocks: it brandishes some sharp twists and turns that make you continually think about the characters actions', and their motivations, and the future implications in search for the truth. In fact, as much as the characters attempt to find out the truth, each person it concealing something from one another, almost every relationship in the film has some opacity amongst the inherent trustThe two main actors Peyman Moaadi as Nader and Leila Hatami as Simin must be given their due credit, they are astounding. They both evolve in their characters so naturally and exhibit all the qualities of a father/mother, jaded lovers, carers, struggling against legal and social bureaucracies, probing for the truth and justice. They are neither saints nor villains and lot of the success in the portrayal is how much we see ourselves in them, as humans.It seems unfair not to mention the other principals: Sarina Farhadi as Termeh, also very good as the moral of sorts for the story observing the chaos around, questioning events and (in a clever touch) acting as the audience's conscience. Shahab Hosseini as Houjat and Sareh Bayat as Razieh as the contentious couple who instigate the film's second and substantial appearances in court texture the characters with deep layers, complex, passionate emotions and serve beautifully to contrast the different social classes, stages of family, religious beliefs and simply to create conflict.There are so many layers to the film, how each character is essence is trying to uncover the truth, which we as the audience are discovering at the same time; each person trusts someone else deeply yet is often deceiving their beloved (huband-wife-daughter). How what we perceive (whether truthfully or not) influences our judgments of others and how our ideas on religion and class colour that perception.What is ostensibly a family (melo)drama twists into riffs on father/daughter, father son relationships, class hierarchy, the role of women in an oppressive society, the family legal system and being a full-time carer. Part political-critique, part mystery, social-drama; this is absolutely mesmerising, masterful cinema. I can't wait to see it again."
88,A Separation,10,10 March 2012,An exquisitely balanced film.,"""A Separation"" achieves a perfect balance. A balance between husband and wife (with the daughter as the fulcrum) and two disputing families (with the truth--and the other daughter--as the fulcrums). But there are many more balances; between: staying and going abroad, taking care of the infirm elderly and the budding child, modernity and tradition, devoutness and disregard, frustration and acceptance, stubbornness and compassion, the employed and the unemployed, truth and lies, and the known and the unknown. So well balanced, it is impossible to choose which of the many sides to take.This film is worth a thousand briefings on Iran and the Iranian people."
89,A Separation,9,9 March 2012,Piece of Iranian culture with a very good story,"This is certainly one of those rare movies of recent times where both elements of the genre Drama and Mystery shine brightly. The movie starts off with the couple Nader and Simin asking for a divorce over a comparatively light-hearted issue. Slowly but extremely engagingly the movie revolves around serious and religious issues. The truly great facet about the movie's story is that it has sub-plots which are interleaved in a very deft manner such that those eventually accelerates the main plot, which is the separation or divorce of the two protagonists. The other aspect of the movie which really captivated me is the way the director showed the mystery part along with the social drama of relatively upper and lower class Iranian families. Surprising truths are unraveled in the way they should be in a good mystery movie. Kudos to Asghar Farhadi for blending that with the emotional elements like the problems and dilemma of Nader and Simin's daughter. This explains that not for nothing the screenplay of the movie got an Oscar nod.The performance the entire cast is brilliant and just what the situations, created in the movie, needed. From the girl who played Termeh and Shahab Hosseini who played the volatile husband of the maid who Nader hired for household jobs to the lead actors Leila Hatami(Simin) and Peyman Moadi(Nader), everyone more or less excelled in their respective parts. This movie is rich with many cinematic elements which make this a movie a movie-lover would not want to miss."
90,A Separation,9,18 December 2012,Fatherland or motherland - a decision,"Iranian director Asghar Farhadi's ""A Separation"" is a truly remarkable film. It's more than a picture about two people who want to leave each other, rather it deals with many things that divide people, which isn't necessarily a bad thing per se - but what divides entails ramifications for either side. On the forefront of course there's the titular dispute between Nader and Simin, two Iranians. Undoubtedly they love each other, but are filing for divorce - Simin intends to leave the country with her daughter Termeh for the sake of Termeh's future, but Nader wants to stay in Iran taking care of his father, who suffers from Alzheimer. While his father doesn't recognize him, his son still does. But is the illness of the father only a pretext for Nader?Thus the moral conflict between the prospects the west offers and - literally - the fatherland, becomes a central theme from the get-go, yes, but it lingers only in the background until the decision between past and future cannot be avoided. The main part of the film features more dividing situations, tense confrontations and a dramatic incident, all of which highlight fractures in Iranian society: fundamentalist and moderate religion clash, middle class and lower class are played against each other, there's the constant fight between modernity vs. tradition, and pride often gets in the way. The film is full of nuances that can be picked up by attentive viewers which relate directly to Iranian life, but nevertheless the picture as a whole is more than just the sum of its parts and succeeds in resonating universally. Shot with hand-held camera Farhadi's film looks and feels real, provides intimate insights on both sides of whatever argument you're looking at and puts the problem right in your hand. What more can you ask from a movie?"
91,A Separation,9,7 September 2012,A Separation,"This film marks my first time steps into Iranian territory since TURTLES CAN FLY (2004, 8/10), this victory of Academy Awards' BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM OF THE YEAR is a brilliant masterpiece, which thoroughly dissects a present-day moral tale in Tehran homing in a contentious accidental miscarriage revolving about two different families (the middle-class one and the underprivileged one), director Asghar Farhadi masterfully exploits the hand-held camera at its best-posed intimacy to conquer an immensely diligent script, which is sheer creme de la creme and ardently scales the heights of the most intimidating but convincing storytelling which is the best a film could bring about to its audience as an art media.Sparking from a quotidian calamity, the film is confidently yet subtly probing its chain reactions about familial dysfunction, religion misemployment, moral integrity, marital coordination, parental education, nursing for senior citizens, etc. And the hidden truth has been incubating soundly and the sympathy is ample towards both sides and for myself the most appalling epiphany is the religious curse on the underclass mass, which ruthlessly turning the tables while the well-off citizen (for instance, the tutor) could blatantly testify an uncertain assertion under the oath of Quran, even shamelessly deny her cunning attempt to glean information by inducing a 4-year-older. Furthermore strikingly yet expectedly, the most severe collateral damage has been put upon the two children, the most innocent onlookers of the dispute, the final staring between the two girls are hauntingly disturbing, there palpable wounds which will never heal planting inside both two's memories. Mostly enclosed settings (inside the bourgeois couple's apartment, their cars, the maid's low- end shack, his husband's cobbler's house, the classrooms, police office and hospital) and an almost score-free deployment (which I hardly noticed until the ending), the vortex of seeking for the justice is tormenting everyone who are directed or indirected embroiled in. As an inward- delving essay, it is compelling from A to Z and leaves an unanswered question which literally does not need one since its irrelevant at all after the separation evolves into a bona-fide divorce.All the major characters are potently organized and three of its four (Moadi, Bayat and Hosseini) all finish inside my top 10 performances of the year (sorry Hatami, rounding just outside the top tier), also the youngsters are tremendously great under their more compassion-arousing suits. The film presently is my silver medalist and Farhadi champions the BEST DIRECTOR stature in year 2011. So everything considered, the film has a sure fire to survive through the test of time of vindicating its niche in the masterpiece rank, which is my very sanguine appraisal. PS: who's taken the money?"
92,A Separation,10,12 April 2012,A Separation,"A Separation is a film from Iran in Persian with English subtitles. The film takes a look at two families through the course of the film and a situation that develops between them. This situation will ultimately test all of them and their families and watching each individual and trying to ultimately piece together as a viewer on whether who is telling the truth, or not is a large part of the film, but by doing so and as time goes by we get to learn more about the characters in the process as they also get to learn and see different sides of themselves that perhaps they did not know were there. A Separation was an emotionally gripping film that takes hold of your attention very early on already and takes us through quite an ordeal. We can see the pain and frustration the characters in both families are dealing with in this film and how a lot of what they are feeling must really be bottled up, or internalized inside of them because each of them has so much stress and confusion going on, that it is hard to imagine them not finally reaching a breaking point. When the conflict between the two families enters the film it is done in quite an ingenious way. As viewers we don't quite see everything, so in trying to make up in our own minds of who is in the right and who is in the wrong, the film never allows us to do that because it keeps bringing forth evidence from both sides. The way these families act and up to their conclusion about how to settle this feud is done in rather a brilliant way also. We have characters here who are very stubborn and want to get back to just living their lives normally as well as characters who are strapped financially, so they may have to decide which move will best suit them. My favourite aspect of all is the devoted part of one's religion and culture playing a large role here as well. With one character wanting to tell the truth, or even perhaps bend the truth a little bit, but unsure of what to do with the situation their family is in and also doing what is right according to their culture and religion. The story told in this film is a story that basically could be told in any country using any two families basically, but I found that the fact that the film is set in Iran, where they have a different way of life and beliefs than say the Western countries made this all the more fascinating. The fact that a families honour and one's devotion to their religion were very admirable qualities. Please do not take what I say out of context when I say that Iran is different from Western civilizations because I am not trying to be racist in the least when I say that. In fact the characters in this film have such a loyalty to their families, their culture, religion and way of life that I actually found it quite admirable and I don't think it would work as well, or translate as well had it been done and told in an American film. The acting in A Separation is all superb from the entire cast. I have never seen any of these actors in previous films, but they all do such incredible jobs with their characters that I hope I will see them in other films one day soon. The amazing script and direction by Asghar Farhadi is utterly compelling. Some may find this film a little tough to watch because of all the grief and heartache these two families are going through in their day to day lives, but for me it was more of an eye opener than anything else and I could really empathize and sympathize with both families with the situations that they were both in. I think that is one of the best things about the script and film. It allows us to feel and ultimately to care about the situation and what is going on in both these families, so no matter what the final verdict is of their outcome and dispute we really do want to see it ended, but at the same time we want both families to be okay and move on to bigger and hopefully better things in life. We are not biased against one or the other, but rather just made to understood their situations and why they behave the way they do and instead of getting angry over these choices they have made we just as an audience feel pity for them and wish that things had gone a different way and didn't have to be this way. The film from start to finish was absolutely compelling and made us care because of well written characters that made us be allowed to identify and care for them. By allowing us to do so, we can look at their situations differently rather than if we hadn't been introduced to them in this way and just flat out did not care. But the thing is we do care and the subject of honesty is brought to the table here and altogether this is a morality play that will have you talking about it long after you see it. This is an emotionally powerful film with superb performances, a captivating and well developed screenplay that involves the viewer on so many levels and we thank them for that. This certainly did deserve the Academy Award it received for Best Foreign Language Film. One of the best films of last year and a true masterpiece and triumph of cinema."
93,A Separation,9,10 January 2013,Drama at it's best,"Last Asghar Farhadi's family drama is definitely one of the best films of recent years what is evidenced with 59 awards won by the movie including Oscar and Golden Bear, and a total of over 80 nominations. Farhadi is highly respected Iranian filmmaker who has in the past ten years gathered over 20 international awards and was this year ranked among Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. A Separation is the story of an ordinary Iranian family. Mother (Simin) believes that it is better for the life of their daughter to leave Iran and move to the west, while the father (Nader) wants to stay in Iran and take care of his sick father. Conflict leads to the separation of Simin and Nader. Then father's new guardian steps into the story. She accuses Nader for a physical attack in which she lost a child. Although story is seemingly very simple, screenplay is definitely one of the best in recent times. Deep, complex, with great characters that are hard to forget and with authentic depiction of lately demonized Iran. Although a good portion of the cast is relatively amateurish, except Leila Hatami (Simin) and Shahab Hossein (guardian's husband), acting is flawless. The technical part is just as we expect form Farhadi, almost no complaints. One of complaints that goes to technical part is unuse of music, but although some scenes would made better impression no one can say that Farhadi's movies aren't great just as they are. Special strong scenes are the ones from courtroom, starting from the first scene of dialogue between Simin and Nader with the judge which lasts for more than three and a half minutes and which immediately announces way of filming that is only possible with perfect acting. Characters that look so realistically is almost impossible to find. Brilliant movie that is definitely one of the best of 2011."
94,A Separation,10,17 October 2012,a masterpiece,"Watching this wonderfully simple and subtle film I realized that cinema as an art is alive and well in the world and all you need is to know where to look for it. It is the story of a couple,Nader and Simin, who want a divorce. They do not hate each other, they just want different things from life, amongst them, the most important one : where to raise their daughter.Simin wants to emigrate, probably to the West(we find out at the end that she is an English teacher)whereas Nader wants to stay in Iran and care for his ailing father. The facts are simple enough and the film takes on the task to peel this onion and show us the layers of the story. Nader is an intransigent and moral human being who doesn't want to leave his father and his country(the Alzheimer stricken father is such a symbol for a country that lost its way and identity). He cant't relinquish the past in order to build the future(the daughter,)he wants to reconcile them. Simin, on the other hand is portrayed as more materialistic( she counts the money)and superficial(she wants to leave everything behind and start anew. In the end Nader is forced to realize that he doesn't live in a Greek tragedy,that life is full of compromise,that you need the support of the others that truth is not absolute and being a hero seems impossible in the modern world. Simin, on the other hand reveals her humanity, her love of her husband and daughter but she ignores Razeh's plea,either from selfishness or disdain for her superstitious type of religion. The child is the one to chose in the end what kind of future to have, what country to live in, what kind of human being she wants to be.Whichever way she goes I feel that she understands better than her parents that we,human beings,have to struggle to remain pure but cannot do so at the expense of our compassion and humanity."
95,A Separation,10,4 October 2012,Best Film.,"This film is one of the best of all times for me. It revolves around a couple so beautifully that you will never know how time passed. The film is the best example of emotional turmoil through which many of us have to go through at one point of time. From the starting, the film is very much fast. And this became possible through a lot of twists and quick dialog deliveries. The film is a must watch for anyone.PROS:The best part of the film was that there is no one good or bad in the film. By the time you will sympathize with some character, they will start showing different colors. The acting by the cast is true to their purpose. The film clearly defines the meaning of struggle. Everyone has to go through this once in their life. The decisions that the characters make during the film are sure to twist your mind. And this is what keeps you glued.Message: ""Struggle is a part of life."" Verdict: ""A must watch."""
96,A Separation,,19 March 2012,Puzzle of small things,"a drama. a brilliant movie. picture of Iranian society. exploration of love, error, religion and innocence. out of rules. or definitions. a film as a mirror because the crumbs of sin are parts of every life. because solutions are only illusions. because Nader and Simin and Termeh are images of same man/woman at different level of self definition. the values are universal. and the fragility of Razieh is way to understand root of pain beauty, nuances of sacrifice. the world of characters is same like many others. frustrations, need of escape, fake refuges, isolation in self circle, empty words and cowardliness as only door. so, it is not image of far Iran but, in same measure, it is a travel to East, West Europe, to hunt of shadows of America, to fear lakes of each land. ordinary fear, ordinaries solutions. or just verdict of a very long judgment."
97,A Separation,9,18 March 2012,Cross-Culture Experience Not To Miss,"This is one of those movies I felt obligated to go to because it got tons of great reviews by intellectual, artsy folks as well as the fact that it is foreign, to which some assign automatic merit. Sometimes I end up enjoying these movies and sometimes I feel like I'd have had a better time watching the Three Stooges for an hour and a half. Five to ten minutes into A SEPARATION I was hoping Moe, Larry and Curley would enter, stage right. Then a surprise plot twist occurs and I became hooked. My interest aside it wasn't until the drive home that I realized what a magnificent take on Iranian life had been packaged into this film . The viewer gets the present impact of Iran's late 70's Islamic Revolution from as unbiased a point-of-view as is possible. Consider; e.g., that I was able to walk out of the theater contemplating some beneficial aspects of a society guided, in part, by theocratic principles. Instead of envisioning faithful Iranian Muslims as fanatical zealots in robes and burkas I instead understand them as not much different as American churchgoers' e.g., from the Moral Majority to my Catholic heritage. I want to avoid the superficial observation, ""canned"" superlative of saying, ""Golly gee, Iranians are just like me and you."" But you know something, Iranians are just like me and you."
98,A Separation,10,8 August 2011,A Sample of Current Iranian Life,"All reasons and excuses have piled up there over years. It's the time of separation now.Typical Iranian feelings, Iranian life, and Iranian characters.Everything is fine in Iranian life but nothing is.We love each other but we don't. We care about each other but there are external factors affecting our relationship.The epidemic dream of a Utopia abroad makes meaningless all other things you have. A typical of many similar stories of the intention to immigrate which is changing people's lives.Iranian woman's independence of mind and action. Iranian woman's basic role in shaping the structure of family life."
99,A Separation,10,21 January 2012,so what???,"it is so surprising that an Iranian film could absorb so many different viewers around the world and more than that, many echos reflecting back and make an emotional atmosphere around the film. you may love the film or hate it, even by means of statistical or political view, and your reasons are just depend on your consciousness. some American fellows down-rate the film just because it is an Iranian product (maybe an Iranian Product should not be among top 250 films of IMDb list! isn't it a type of message of hatred?), and some Iranian fellows down rate it just because they think it is a political movie belongs to some sort of political view (Green movement), otherwise there are some people who over rate the film just because the same unfair reasons. I rate the film 10 out of 10. I love it and I can enjoy every scenes. but I can not guarantee that you should love the film as much or as deep as I do, I can just tell you: a separation is a precious piece of cinema, please try to watch it without any prejudgement. thank you!"
100,A Separation,9,8 April 2011,"Good screenplay, brilliant acting.","I watched this movie just a few hours ago. It was wonderful, because of Mr Farhadi's useful ability to guide his actors/actresses. The main subject (i.e. divorce) is very common in here in Iran, but screenplay has made it very interesting and dramatic. Mr Kalari (movie's Director of Photography) has an extremely important role (which may be neglected) in this film; His pictures are very real and generally have a fast tempo that corresponds to actors' acting. But one of the few faults of this movie in my view is insignificant role of music , although it (lack of music power) can not be felt easily and director have filled the gap with good dialogues and excellent acting. Mr Farhadi's movies go deep in the heart of Iranian lifestyle and generally are true representatives of this complex society, so if you can watch ""Jodayie Nader az Simin"", never miss it."
101,A Separation,8,25 February 2012,"A great genre example, that also manages to surprise.","With all the horrible and negative stuff we keep hearing about Iran in the news you would almost forget that there also very ordinary people living there, with all their own needs and emotions. And it also always keeps surprising me that a country, that is considered to be so conservative, keeps on delivering so many great movies, with also often a sort of social commentary in them, such as also this movie carries out.I'm often quite fond of these simplistic but very honest and straightforward type of drama's, that have a real sense of realism to them. You feel that nothing ever gets exaggerated with any of its drama and emotions and all of the characters and situations in it feel very real. But what I foremost liked about this movie was that it surprises. It surprises with its story and this movie can really catch you off guard. You think that the movie will be heading into a certain direction with its story and several of its independent plot lines but then things suddenly change, somewhere around the middle, when the story is taking a 180-degree turn and suddenly the movie starts to become about something totally different. Don't worry, I wont spoil it and say what it is but it is truly something that gives the movie more depth, emotion and tension, which makes the movie altogether an even more intriguing watch.I also loved how the story isn't always telling you everything and you are constantly wondering what is the truth and who is lying and why. This also makes the movie unpredictable and also provides it with plenty of surprising and interesting plot twists, in the movie its second half.It's also dealing with some delicate issues, for an Islamic movie that is. Issues such as divorce and Alzheimers are being handled, while you could also see this movie as one that is criticizing the Iranian legal system, by showing some of its flaws. But it's also definitely not afraid to show the flaws of us, human beings. This as well obviously adds to the overall realism of the entire movie.And it's definitely also a well put together movie, that is also a good looking one. The dynamic camera-work really gets you involved with all of the characters and events and the movie has a pleasant pace to it. There is nothing pretentious or overly artistic about this movie, like perhaps some similar movies often tend to do. It's really being an honest movie, about real people, dealing with real life- but not always ordinary, situations.It's always hard to judge the performance of actors that act in a language I just don't understand but all of the actors in this movie still managed to give me a feeling that their performance in it was really great and very natural. This goes for basically all actors, both young and old.Of course it's true that you need to be into these sort of movies to fully appreciate it but I just can't imaging someone not being taken by this movie.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
102,A Separation,10,4 April 2011,"Separation of rare Simin, a positive look: orchestration characterization","Farhadi warm and sincere drama about deterioration and disintegration of life, lies and disloyalty and concealment for human beings. Simin separation of rare or perhaps an urban drama, a drama is sad and bitter court revolving putting ""false judgments."" Full of detail and narrative style incorporated in the script, of course, approach and Mstndgvnh abstract and realistic arrangements and very unappealing! Bitter and dark film, and the deterioration of the marital relationship during the turmoil and the disintegration of the draws. The first relationship between a couple of middle-class upward (Simin and Nader) the disintegration and separation in their relationship and the other, between a couple of low class (proof and Razieh). The first relationship with women migrate abroad and oppose this decision man is declining and the victim; term, is their daughter. Relationship between poverty and narrow the second hand and debt to an intolerable point, and misfortunes of life, and pushed the victim; mucker and her aborted fetus. What is seen only cold relationship, Ghmbar, bitter and painful life is these couples.In the recent movie Farhadi, characterization compared with the type of drama and narrative film as in all moments, is a step ahead. You and I in a complex narrative of separation of rare vs. puzzle Simin accurate characterization and regular story, brought low. Farhadi and architectural layout of all elements of characterization brings the story to perfection. Away from any negligence and carelessness. Unlike any Rvaytsh; narrative full of rush and stress.Farhadi psychological effects, characterizing the personality and the community hospital in dealing with the community against each other Gzndhay reviewed and explored the fragmentary character and gives her a hand in the semi-balanced film with a basic rhythm and a rhythm available and regularly introduced and take forward its result is a characterization of the orchestration.View of primary and first scene with the confrontation and Simin rare, original story and characters point of view of our viewers judge for judicial office puts on such a story should be about individual personalities to judge. But the kind of story and narrative progress, we are far from any position does. Dialogues exchanged between them due to divorce because of opposition to immigration Simin and Nader and then Crowded House and splurge their father and the presence of Alzheimer's and girl grieved inside a torn life and seek to decline presence of the pregnant woman as a maid with the living conditions and relationships with her husband and ultimately the consequences of this chain is contiguous to the formation of a corpus of an integrated characterization, Farhadi's film is considerable. ALI KOHAN FOROTAGHEH"
103,A Separation,10,5 February 2012,Best Film of the Year (Not just Best Foreign Film),"Simply the best film I've ever seen, on a par with ""The Lives of Others"".What is astonishing about the film is that it is the first time in 40 years of watching Iranian films that I have witnessed ""under-acting"". Every character, from the lead male protagonist to the man with Alzheimer's, was so incredibly realistic that I had the impression none of them knew they were being filmed. The Iranian regime is furious with the film's success simply because the film portrays the real, daily lives of ordinary Iranians struggling to make ends meet while the Fat Cats enjoy their ill-gotten gains abroad. It deserves ""Best Film of the Year"" and not just ""Best Foreign Film""."
104,A Separation,8,4 February 2012,What's wrong is wrong ... but what's wrong?,"Greetings again from the darkness. This one finally made it to Dallas and it's now clear why it is not only the Oscar favorite for Best Foreign Language Film, but also received a Best Original Screenplay nomination. It's truly that good ... and powerful ... and thought provoking. I caught myself changing my mind more than once on some of the issues these characters faced.The film opens with Nader and Simin (Peyman Moadi and Leila Hatami) in front of a judge to determine if they will be granted a divorce. Simin wants to take their daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi, the director's daughter) to study abroad. Nader doesn't disagree with the plan, only the timing. He refuses to leave his Dad, who suffers from Alzheimer's, alone in Iran. In a poignant moment, Nader points out that while his dad may not know him, he still certainly knows his dad. This is the first of a recurring theme throughout ... there are numerous ways to look at every issue.When Simin moves in with her mother, Nader hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to be his dad's caregiver. After a few days, Nader and Razieh have a heated argument and he pushes her out of the apartment. Next thing he knows, she is in the hospital after a miscarriage. She files a claim saying Nader pushed her down the stairs causing the miscarriage. The core of the story is the actions of the key characters during the inquisition by the judge/inspector. Nothing seems clear cut and each character's recall and statements vary from moment to moment.A key point is that these are all basically good and moral people. Muslim believers in various stages. None would purposefully sin, yet each is trying to protect something or someone. The script is fascinating in its detail and subtlety. It moves like real life rather than a movie trying to get crammed into a 2 hour window. Written and directed by Asghar Farhad, the film deserves all accolades and acclaim. Let's hope it finds an audience in the U.S. We could certainly use more stories and films like this."
105,A Separation,10,15 April 2011,A Fantastic Drama,"Separation is one of the most rare cases in Iranian Movie Industry created by Farhadi , this new talented director who started from TV and now has the golden bear in his hand for such an artistic film.The story line is purely concentrated on the realities of the current Iranian society . The people who do not prefer to live in Iran and intends to immigrate to other countries . The concept of Religion mixed with people's lives and their strict beliefs about wright and wrong. It's actually a bitter movie and definitely not among "" Happy ending Hollywood Movies "" but a must-see Dramma in the last decade of Iranian Movie industry.Actings are beyond professional level specially Shahab Hosseini who has cooperated with the director in his last movie "" About Elly "".Go on ... See this movie and enjoy the total different atmosphere of Iranian new age of movies."
106,A Separation,9,25 February 2012,Absolutely brilliant!,"I saw this movie about 10 days ago and I am still thinking about it. The more I think, the more I see in it. This is a complex, layered film about human nature, and it takes place in Iran. There is no good vs evil here. Everyone has some good and some bad in him/her. The wife (Simin)who wants to move abroad with her daughter, while ignoring her father in law with Alzheimers, the husband (Nader)who loves his family so much that he cannot tell the whole truth in a court of law, a maid (Razieh)who is too afraid to tell her husband she is working for a family.There are so many shades of gray in this movie, and despite the seriousness of the subject, it never become melodramatic. I felt sympathy for all the characters- even Hojjat the hot tempered husband of the maid. The 11 year old girl Termeh is caught in the middle of it all, and she sees the lie more easily than the adults. The maid's little daughter is very cute.The acting is top notch by everyone; the screenplay is one of the best. The characters are not only vivid but very realistic. The direction is very good. So why did I give it 9 and not 10? It's a personal preference that I like to see a real end to a story. After putting us through the roller coaster for 2 hours I wanted to know which parent the daughter decided to live with. The fact that we did not get an answer seemed like a cop out to me. OTOH I have my own theory about who she will choose. Some people like generating discussion like that after a movie ends.I have not seen the other foreign films nominated for the Oscar this year, so I can't say if this is the best movie in that category, but I have to say it's one of the best and one of the most interesting movie I have seen in the last few years.If you don't see it, you will miss something very special."
107,A Separation,8,3 February 2012,"This movie is a window for seeing Iranian people "" Their lives"" ..Thanks Mr.Farhadi","I never thought , I sit next to an American in US and watching an Iranian movie , Thanks to Asghar Farhadi. So happy that this movie could get lot of awards. The most important thing which is making me happy is "" out of Iran "" They see we are like them "" loving our kids, family , and ...."" Thanks Farhadi for opening a windows from the brighter part of our country. It shows how people think and try to survive, How people care about their children, their fathers and their future , How they deal with their normal life , how they try to just having life as a normal human being. Yeas , Iranian women can drive , yeas parent go and take their kids from school , they help them in homework."
108,A Separation,9,22 January 2012,"A movie about justice, family and The conscience","I saw ""A Separation"" after it won the Golden Globe. This movie, is a very good tragedy and can makes you cry. But it's not a depressing movie, but talks about justice, family, relations and The conscience. By watching this movie, you can take a look at Iran's society, that almost never see. Given the harsh conditions prevailing in, it seems Mr. Farhadi has been able to release this movie in Iran with a smart view. ""A Separation"" shows life of people who have problems and personal situations in Iran much like people all around the world. I strongly recommending to everyone watching this movie and I think watching ""A Separation"" change our views in life."
109,A Separation,8,31 December 2011,Emotionally draining,"A Separation is a simple story told in a complex manner. An Iranian couple seek a divorce in the opening scene with the mother, Simin, explaining to an unseen judge that she wants her 10 year old daughter, Termeh to have a better life by leaving the country. Her husband, Nader wishes to stay in Iran to take care of his elderly father who has advanced Alzheimer's disease and needs constant care. Simin leaves her husband and daughter and goes to live with her parents. A woman desperate for money, Razieh, is hired to watch the old man and soon realizes it is too much for her to handle. There are no light moments, and be prepared to pay close attention to detail for it to come together in the end. This is emotionally and intellectually draining material in rapid fire Farsi, so speed reading subtitles is required.The acting is superb all around and this is an exceptionally well made movie by Asghar Farhadi, a very talented director. As an ensemble, this is as good as it gets, with everyone involved being so believable that the film has the look of a documentary. A very memorable drama indeed."
110,A Separation,9,23 December 2011,A movie that watches you ...,"Throughout the movie, it feels like you are right in the middle of the story, as if you are Nader or any other character. There are no dramatic pauses or delayed reactions and the camera moves with the actors. You are immersed in the story that follows a single pace of misery but done to perfection by Farhadi! I truly enjoyed the movie and it kept me engaged for the whole time. I really want to know what happened in the end as the ending leaves you in suspense. Unlike most Iranian movies where some scenes are mandatory (so that the film gets a nod from the Ministry of Guidance!!), this movie was pure cinema and didn't try to appeal to anyone in particular. It flows really well and the simplicity of the events (and the script as a whole) makes the movie very believable and close to one's emotion and experience. It also shows that you don't need millions of dollars (which is generally spent on blowing up buildings, shooting a whole bunch of 'bad' guys, and stripping an 18 year old somewhere along the storyline) to make a good movie. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Iranian cinema, this would be a good start ..."
111,A Separation,10,12 December 2011,great flow of story line,"A separation seems to be the about the ongoing fight of deciding between right and wrong that has been also witness in earlier work of this director in ""about Elly"" which happens in here again and is about how far can we go on with our lies?as an Iran-born male, the environment of the movie was no surprise to me but after living for even a little while in a different country like Canada, you notice how different things are in Iran culture beliefs laws and this movie does an outstanding job in showcasing them.this movies is in fact the completion of the ""about Elly"" because you can almost feel that the director has became more mature in his style and that basically gives you a much better directing and storyline that makes itself separate."
112,A Separation,10,16 November 2011,Marriage Problems,"It is a most watch movie brilliant , make sure you see it with a loved one!it shows the real face of the Iranian community relating the marriage problems.I found this to be one of the most gripping and moving films I've seen this year. Superbly directed and wonderfully acted and aided by an excellent script it is surely one the films of the year. A 5 star winner!quoting the guardians review on the movie: Farhadi shows how this situation is like a pool of petrol into which any event lands like a lighted match. Everyone is aware of their rights and how angry they feel at injustices and slights, and the women are grimly aware of the double responsibility of finding a working solution and persuading their menfolk to accept it."
113,A Separation,9,31 January 2012,Minimalist masterpiece to be remembered as classic cinema for decades,"It's difficult to make 'A Separation' sound stellar. The film has a minimalist style to it. The cinematography is basically the same way. The screenplay, while basic, is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Lines are fired back from top-notch actors/actresses with either sass or intelligence:""I didn't hit her."" ""Then why is she in the hospital?""This ""then why"" kind of wise-guy response appears often, and grips you into the suspenseful story even more. Contrary to the beliefs of some, the film is not necessarily depressing, but it relies heavily on dialogue, lots of which is spoken loudly (like in arguments). 'A Separation' focuses on each character, to develop them and make you feel for all of them at the same time, even when two primary characters completely detest each other. In other words, there's not a single person who's just ""there"".Overall, one would think the constant use of hand-held camera could become very irritating and make the film look low-budget, but it really doesn't. In fact, the minimalist approach to film-making in this movie helps evoke emotion. There's no music in the background, not that many stationary camera shots; the film is delivered entirely through realism: almost as if we're watching it through someone's eyes.That's a lot to say about a movie, as most films DO rely on musical accompaniment to manipulate the emotions of viewers. But no, this one is not melodrama. It's REAL sorrow. REAL feelings. Congrats to the cast & crew: your movie is ridiculously minimalist, yet you have literally proved yourself better than a large percentage of the people still working in Hollywood today."
114,A Separation,9,17 December 2011,The Last Of Farhadi's Trilogy,"A Separation is the Asghar Farhadi's last movie from the trilogy: Fireworks Wednesday, About Elly and A Separation. All these movies have the same themes: Love, Family, Truth; and these themes are displayed through a social and ethical platform. Directing, Writing and Actings of the movie are flawless and perfect and it deserves all the prizes it's winning. Farhadi's Fireworks Wednesday is an easier film to understand: within the movie you struggle to find the truth and in the end everything's clear, somehow nothing to doubt. About Elly, the second movie in trilogy is more complicated: it's hard to find out the truth, relationships in families are more complex and the movie ends with almost an open ending and many answers to questions in viewer's mind remain unknown. A Separation, which has more powerful ethical and social context, is the most complicated and mind-involving one. After watching the whole movie even several times, it's almost impossible to blame anyone and it's Farhadi's goal to create not easy to judge characters, just like the real world. What is the truth? What is happening through Nader and Simin's minds that leads them to divorce? What if Simin is right about Nader's changed emotions? These questions are still with me when I think about A Separation. But if you haven't seen the film, don't hesitate; just enjoy perfection of Farhadi's work."
115,A Separation,9,24 November 2012,So simple a premise envelopes such a complex plot,"So simple a premise envelopes such a complex plot. The fact that it is already overwhelming to see the usually under-the-wraps domestic life of Iran and to couple it with near perfect screenplay, performances and mounting suspense is more than what you can ask for and nothing you would have expected. Doing the right thing, setting an example, moral ambiguity, people's reaction to different circumstances were so beautifully fit into this complex puzzle. Payman Maadi (Nader) and Leila Hatami (Simin) are a couple going through a divorce after 14 years of marriage. While the reasons could be complicated and ambiguous, it is taking a toll on their teenage daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) and Nader's father who is suffering from Alzheimer's and requires constant care and attention. When he employs Razieh (Sareh Bayat) for household work, an incident triggers aggression from Nader who unconsciously acts rude to Razieh. Nader's life crumbles into further shambles when Razieh's family accuses and lodges a case on him for murder as she has suffered a miscarriage. When Razieh's husband Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini), an unemployed, depressed and debt ridden man takes matters to his hand, things turn ugly.The beauty of it is the realistic approach taken in every frame resisting the temptations of being sensational. The screenplay was so exhilarating pushing the boundaries of such a simple premise into heart-pounding suspense. The ideology, the general mindset and day-to-day life in Iran was quite informative and fulfills your food for curiosity. Coming to performances, it is near perfect with none tampering into each other's space and doing the best in their zone. A special mention should go to the sweet little girl who plays Razieh's daughter as she conveys a lot through her big expressive eyes and hardly uttering a word. While the divorce story as advertised plays a poignant role, it mostly takes a backseat during the tense drama. Some scenes that were informative or packs an impact > When Razieh calls a religious helpline to check if she could change a helpless old man's pants > Razieh's daughter's eyes conveying and covering the facade of ugly spats > When Teremeh confronts Nader if he lied > Climax tussle between Razieh and Hojjat > Nader's unflinching love and support for his fatherSo simple a premise envelopes such a complex plot"
116,A Separation,8,21 November 2012,Serious and Engaging,"""A Separation"" directed by Ashgar Farhadi, and winner of the academy award for best foreign film is a serious and engaging drama giving the world a story of Iranian life replete with excellent cultural nuances and originalities. (spoilers) The movie starts out running with what seems to be a break-up between a couple but really masks the true story of social class fighting. The narrative is superbly written - especially the main conflict where the truth is nicely obscured to create suspense and tension for the audience. We're wondering what exactly happened, and yet some important questions even as the credits roll are left unanswered. Worthy of it's award and one of the better movies of late."
117,A Separation,9,18 November 2012,It is a mirror that anyone of us can look at and see ourselves in the same situation,"I can already see the reason why it wins Golden Bear, Golden Globe foreign films and Oscar's foreign film winner 2012. This is a high-level, fast-pace drama that deals with many controversial issues covering family, cultural differences, religion and legal boundaries all of which can happen particularly on a daily Iranian life.Acting performances are top-notch. In a modern way of living, decisions are forced to be promptly made, but at the same time carrying heavy consequences, whether it is better to be honest or to lie for the sake of the greater good. Even amongst decent, good-hearted individuals, things can get real ugly due to stubbornness, lack of communication and differences in opinion/principals, and consequences include adverse effects on relationships, family and society. This film encompasses all of that.Especially Termeh's role as the daughter who became the victim within the center of the catastrophic mess and who tried hard to remedy it her own way. And, the law does not favour everyone. Although there is some lack of character growth which was an element understandably sacrificed as everyone is too busy trying to solve various problems of their own, instead I think that is the purpose behind the film, for the viewers to finally look at themselves in the mirror and question about similar things happening daily but did not have time to stop and to contemplate on the bigger picture. Brilliant, compelling masterpiece."
118,A Separation,9,20 May 2012,"Of many, many shades of grey...","A great film does not require special effects. It does not require a suspenseful plot, action scenes,famous faces,dramatic twists and turns and an unexpected ending. A Separation is a triumph of the art of storytelling over the glitz and gloss of these other elements that are so much easier to find in today's films. The film is not for children, but it is about children, and about children who grow up into people who look like adults, but whose conflicts are enlarged versions of playground scuffles, but with much more serious consequences. A couple decides to separate, and there is a child involved, as well as an ill parent. How formulaic this could have been. But Farhadi has created, with these basic elements, a narrative of such power and meaning that it carries the viewer with him. It is impossible to remain detached while watching this film, which is as much a commentary on class and gender in modern-day Iran as it is on the power (and spaces outside) of the state, and on changing dynamics in modern families. Simin, the wife who wants to leave Iran, never spells out clearly her reasons for wanting to do so; her claustrophobia is implied, and her husband is not the major cause. Simin has choices of which Razieh, the maid, cannot dream. Yet, Razieh for all her troubles, is less troubled that Simin. Nader, played brilliantly by Payam Moadi, is clearly a good man, but his actions are questionable at times. This a film about the human condition, its dilemmas and conflicts; it is not about resolution of these, but rather about the impossibility of resolution.I first saw this film in in Farsi with German subtitles, and despite faint familiarity with one language and absolute ignorance of the other, I could understand the broad contours of the film. I have just seen it again with English subtitles, and the magic of this film is such that although understanding the dialogues (many of them subtle political commentary)adds detail to the narrative, the narrative has the power to move even when the actors' lines were 'felt' rather than 'understood'."
119,A Separation,10,28 December 2011,Iranian cinema at its best !,"I'm a big fan of cinema and TV, of course not just any movie or TV series but the best. I've watched lots of movies and series and I just can say, I've never seen anything like this in a long time, at least amongst Iranian movies! As an Iranian I was watching a part of my country people having their daily life and problems. Everyone from their point of view, thinking their problem is more important than the others. I had the pleasure of watching it on DVD (unfortunately I missed it when it was on big screen) and I couldn't believe that it was just a movie and the characters weren't real or they were just acting! Actually, I have to say that they weren't acting, they were living their roles in front of the camera. All of the cast from the little girl to the ill old man, they were real to me as my family members are. As the movie was approaching to the ending minutes I was just wishing that it didn't end. I don't want to spoil anything and I want everyone of you to watch this masterpiece and live every second of every minute of it. I assure you, it will remain on your mind for a long time. Just watch it and spread the word."
120,A Separation,10,5 April 2011,Ambient Spotlight,"""I've lost everything -- and you're scaring me of a sentence? Fear God!"" This line appears to be taken out of an ancient anecdote, but it's taken from this very movie. A masterpiece, a bitter drama, comparable to Hollywood dramas. It's shot like a documentary, and focuses on a ""very recent"" issue, according to the director: Divorce. Although divorce is not a ""recent"" thing, it was a taboo and stigmatic not many years ago, not only in Iran, but almost in every country. These days divorce is something that happened at least to one person you're closely related too. Some people, especially divorce attorneys, make thousands out of it. ""Post-divorce drama"" is a newly-coined term, cured by a weekend in Thailand or drinking to death -- it's not the only ""trauma"" that comes with divorce. Divorce is a change of lifestyle, and a very bad change, and this movie is trying to depict what might happen if someone can't overcome it -- divorce may significantly affect other people's lives too. For that matter, everyone can empathize with this movie, no matter where he's been bred or what he has been taught. And that's the beauty of this movie.But this movie has an extra bonus for people from countries with decaying economy, such as most eastern-Europe countries, Iran itself and various other places that failed the battle with imperialism. And another extra bonus for people who experienced divorce or a very dysfunctional family, like the reviewer himself.And finally I'd like to point out that if it wasn't for Hosseini's brilliant performance, this movie wouldn't be a success."
121,A Separation,9,3 March 2012,Quietly brilliant,"This deserved a fistful of Oscars. Canny, cunning, and telegraphs nothing; nice homage to the Italian neo-realists and perhaps to authors such as Milos Forman. A film with superb control, powerful plotting, discreet handling of emotion, very fine art direction, and also something of cultural interest, namely the contrast it shows between Eastern ideas of justice (i.e., systems) and ours. The actors are superb and seem to have had excellent direction. Only two hesitations, first, the relatively one-dimensional qualities of the female lead (but that was thematically logical) and secondly, the mystery which Westerners will be pondering, whether this film sweetens the view of life under the mullahs. But that's only marginally relevant, because this film is about the agony of growing old and apart and about the utility of truth; and it ploughs a field familiar to all of us. Bravo Iran for giving us this."
122,A Separation,9,16 January 2012,Very nice movie,"Very deep and moving talking about one of the most important problem in young educated Iranian.Has some of the best people in Iranian Cinema.You may need some Iranian friends to explain some of Iranian laws.""Sareh Bayat"" had the best play as supporting actress.You will enjoy it, a Cinema that doesn't use Sex doesn't have special effect and it only about people and their daily life.You will see how depended are Iranian family are. How hard is for them to leave the country.And one last point how much religion is in their believe. The poor family doesn't accept the money because it may not consider correct by their believe"
123,A Separation,9,22 January 2012,an un-stylish film examining human interaction,"there's nothing stylish here; no beautiful cinematography or amazing shots that takes ones breath away.. the attraction here is the characters and the way they are built throughout to lead us to their actions; one example is when Nadir, the lead, sends his daughter to return the tip back from the gas station worker, because it simply isn't fair.. this kind of character establishment indicates and assumes a lot of what is to come. the storytelling and the story in itself are extremely enthralling and gripping, addressing, but never allowing for a definitive statement on its subtly raised themes, truth, honesty and the characters' self-interest. the story is tangled up and weaved real intricately, causing the characters to be in difficult and challenging moral positions. however, to me, the film was perfect in the first two thirds in its course, until it took a slight turn away from where i was hoping it would continue. nevertheless, the film ultimately handled itself laudably till end."
124,A Separation,4,26 July 2013,A two hour long soap opera,"While I give props for the realness of the plot, the movie is downright boring. It can scarcely evoke empathy when showing the harrowing situations the male character endures, and annoyance at the unbearable, unbelievably self-centered wife.While not liking characters has nothing to do with how good the film actually is, in this case, it's the only thing that stays after you are finished with it.I'd pass unless you are a husband during a marital crisis looking for a reason to rant at an (sorry for the repetition, but it's the perfect adjective) unbearable spouse."
125,A Separation,10,30 June 2012,brilliant film,"Iran won Oscar !wow!this is amazing.A Separation is a great movie .it's the best story the best cutting, the best actors you've ever seen!I would give it 11 out of 10 if possible .this film is about 140 min, but you don't feel pass of time at all. the drama of film is very strong. Asghar Farhadi is a smart director and all of his movies are human conception he knows what to write and what to direct!I wonder why Hollywood is incapable of making similar films.The cost is minimal !""Sareh Bayat"" had the best play as supporting actress. There is also another nice movie by the same director - 'About Elly (2009)', but I think I liked this one more"
126,A Separation,8,3 May 2012,"Very good, but not brilliant by my point of view","Widely acclaimed as one of the best films of 2011, A Separation was released in my country with quite a delay, but I could finally confirm the virtues from this Iranian movie, whose deceptively simple screenplay hides devastating reflections about the human nature, not to mention a very interesting look to the ""normal"" life in Iran, a country which might be misunderstood by the inhabitants of the Western world. Having said that, I liked this film more because of its cultural content than because of its screenplay, and I think it was a bit overrated.As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, one of the main reasons why I liked A Separation pretty much is because it introduced me to the daily life of Iranian people, who are much more ""Westernalized"" than I imagined, but still subject to the omnipresent influence of religion in every aspect of their existence. Independently from the family drama which impulses the film, I think that the most important function from A Separation is as a ""demystification"" of the Islamic culture which, thanks to the cinema and TV, has surely taken much more exotic and sinister dimensions in the minds from the rest of the world (specially to those of us who consume abundant quantities of North American popular entertainment). Needless to say that that doesn't only reflect the natural environment from A Separation, but also its solid screenplay, which simultaneously finds the differences which separate us from the characters, and the similarities which connect us to them, regardless of the part of the world we are in.As for the formal story of A Separation, I really appreciated the fact that it ignored the schemes from commercial cinema in order to employ an organic and realistic development of events and decisions which mold the characters' destiny. In that aspect, A Separation isn't like other family dramas...and however, it covers the same narrative field without using dramatic clichés to make us feel the emotions and conflicts from the characters. The performances are perfect, and one of the main reasons why this movie works is because we perceive the characters as real people from the first scene. Meanwhile, director Asghar Farhadi shows an excellent handling of cameras, locations and scene choreographs, but without unnecessary outshine; I would almost say that A Separation looks like a documentary, but I don't want to give the impression that it belongs to the ""simulated documentary"" niche, because it's not like that...the sensation of realism and immediate presence is precisely due to the fact that the camera doesn't hinder nor is noticed. We are in the same places the characters are, and that can occasionally feel uncomfortable...Nevertheless, I have to say that I couldn't understand some details from the story completely well because of my ignorance of some aspects from the Iranian society (for example, I never understood whether the ""lenders"" have an official influence in judicial processes, or if that's just an instance of governmental corruption). Besides of those ""cultural holes"" (which are naturally my fault), I found some moments repetitive, which I think could have been deleted without making the film loose the impact, at the same time that would have made the movie a bit more agile. However, A Separation definitely deserves a recommendation, and even though I enjoyed the cultural experience more, I can't deny that the film is very good regarding screenplay, performances and direction."
127,A Separation,4,25 April 2013,Waste of time and energy - didn't deserves Oscar prize at all,"Same as the other stereotypes. this movie has nothing special to offer. watching this movie is a waste of time and money. won Oscar? yeah! Oscar became more and more political these years. If you were familiar with Iranian movies then you would understand that the script, cast & crew or many other thins in this movie is boring and repeated over thousands times in other Iranian movies. and why all of a sudden one of the almost unknown directors in Iran became famous and made such a movie and won the Oscar prize!? if I want to rate this director from 1 to 10 he will get 3 maybe 4! P.S: For your information, this review has written by an Iranian who doesn't support the current regime in Iran at all. then stop attacking critics by false accusations."
128,A Separation,9,7 March 2012,Snapshot of how police-state theocracy grinds down people,"A tragic story about how good intentions can start off a snowball that turns into an avalanche of conflict, moral self-betrayal and tragedy in a context whose cultural, social and political oppressions feed into and off this downward slide. Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi) are a middle-class couple fighting over the future of their daughter, Termeh: Simin wants to take her overseas so the girl will not have to grow up in a misogynistic theocracy but Nader can't leave his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who is in an advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease, behind and Termeh won't leave without Dad. Simin files for divorce and leaves Nader and Termeh to care for the elderly man but Nader also has to work so on Simin's recommendation he hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a young working-class woman, to look after Grandpa. The work of looking after Nader's dad is too much for the pregnant Razieh who also has a small girl, Somayeh, in tow and so a series of mishaps occurs which escalate into confrontations that have the effect of straining Simin and Nader's fragile marriage further and roping in other innocent parties such as Termeh's tutor, various neighbours and Razieh and her husband Hojjat's relatives and his creditors. Along the way, Termeh, perhaps the wisest and sanest person in the film, learns a hard lesson about moral ambiguity, the class divide between herself and Somayeh, the oppressive role that religion is made to play in Iranian society, and how living in Iran with all its restrictions simply grinds good people like her parents, Razieh and others into situations where they abase themselves and one another.So many problems as highlighted in this film exist in modern Iranian society due to its police-state nature and ham-fisted interpretation of Islamic principles and shari'a law. If the theocracy weren't so oppressive towards women, Simin would never have thought of leaving the country and Razieh might have left overbearing and violent Hojjat ages ago. If the government would allow free exchanges between medical professionals and scientists, help for Alzheimer's disease sufferers would be more available and Simin and Nader would know enough to realise that Nader's father is deteriorating rapidly and that he needs to be in a nursing home to receive 24/7 care. If the government weren't so strict and narrow-minded in structuring society along religious lines, the officials in charge of mediating disputes could offer better advice to parties in conflict other than rely on simplistic interpretations of Islam. Farhadi's genius in ""A Separation"" is to show at once how a theocratic society such as Iran's with its structures and ideology is ill-equipped to deal with day-to-day problems that Nader, Simin, Razieh and Hojjat encounter, and how they all end up not only coming to blows with one another but meaner and baser as a result.Some people might believe that Islam is being criticised in this film but I disagree; true, Razieh relies too much on the Phone-a-mullah Helpline service for advice as to whether it's OK for a woman to wash an unrelated man's privates but her example is not all that different from those North Americans who rely on ""What would Jesus do?"" agony aunts on radio and cable TV for advice on losing weight, how to deal with kids skipping Bible classes and getting little Ebenezer or Jayleigh to do their creationist science homework (because the kids figured out they were being lied to). It's likely that Razieh has turned to an Allah-of- the-gaps religion for comfort from hot-tempered Hojjat, coping with his family and the pressure of poverty which forces her into accepting a job that's beyond her ability to cope with and requires a long commute as well. The real criticism should be aimed at the government for abusing Islam and its principles in such a way as to alienate Simin, Nader and Termeh from it and to reduce Razieh to a child incapable of making independent moral decisions. There is a suggestion in the film that Simin has told Nader that Razieh has confided in her of her (Razieh's) doubts about the cause of her miscarriage and that Nader uses what Razieh has told Simin and Razieh's own simple religious faith to blackmail both Razieh and Hojjat and make them look bad in front of Hojjat's family.The acting all round is top class and viewers will sympathise deeply with the characters and above all Termeh and Somayeh. Moaadi especially gives a great performance as Nader and Sarina Farhadi as the intelligent and sensitive Termeh is also a stand-out performer. Filming with a hand-held camera throughout gives the movie a voyeuristic intimacy that involves the audience, particularly in its opening scene in which the audience is placed in the position of the court judge mediating between Simin and Nader as Simin applies for divorce. Viewers will see something of the daily grinding pressure on Nader, Razieh and the rest of the cast placed by the strictures of Iranian theocratic society as they try to do the best they can to survive and raise their children; the film clearly demonstrates this pressure is not unique to those characters but applies to all Iranians as they try to negotiate and organise their lives under and around the restrictions the government places on them. No wonder so many people are so desperate to leave the country, so much so that they are willing to pay smugglers and risk dangerous sea voyages to countries such as Australia and Canada."
129,A Separation,10,4 March 2012,A Great Iranian Modern Film,"A Separation is a critically acclaimed Iranian film written and directed by Asghar Farhadi, starring Leila Hatami, Peyman Moaadi, Shahab Hosseini, Sareh Bayat and Sarina Farhadi. It focuses on an Iranian middle-class couple who separate, and the intrigues which follow when the husband hires a lower-class caretaker for his elderly father.Set in contemporary Iran,it is a compelling drama about the dissolution of a marriage. Simin wants to leave Iran with her husband Nader and daughter Termeh. Simin sues for divorce when Nader refuses to leave behind his Alzheimer-suffering father. Her request having failed, Simin returns to her parents' home, but Termeh decides to stay with Nader. When Nader hires a young woman to assist with his father in his wife's absence, he hopes that his life will return to a normal state. However, when he discovers that the new maid has been lying to him, he realizes that there is more on the line than just his marriage.A Separation is a great movie, a look inside a world so foreign that it might as well be another planet, yet so universal that its observations are painfully familiar to anyone, anywhere.Also,it moves beyond one couple's sundering marriage to reveal growing rifts between generations, ideologies, religious mind-sets, genders and classes in contemporary Iran.Finally,it captures the messiness of a dissolving relationship with keen insight and searing intensity for it was morally complex, suspenseful, and consistently involving."
130,A Separation,1,9 January 2015,in a Loop,"This film is in a loop  a vicious circle. The couple argues  they go to court  they argue some more. They bring more and more into the argument  the care-taker woman caring for the son's senile father. Then the care-taker woman's husband joins the fray. Their children join in. They all argue  and they go to see the judge  which is incidentally like Grand Central Station.Come on folks this is a soap opera. This is not epic, not fantastic, not the best, not brilliant (and all the other superlatives I keep seeing on IMDb). If it were American, Canadian, European, would anyone care for this movie?REALLY, REALLY OVER-RATED!!! BEWARE"
131,A Separation,10,2 May 2012,A Separation - A dramatic masterpiece!,"First of all I have to say that, if I were to keep this movie on the #1 spot of movies released in 2011, then there cant be any movie to earn their place in the next 5 spots. A Separation is way beyond great than any other movie released in 2011 (movies which I have seen).Its a long time since I have seen a drama which is both realistic and gripping. Asghar Farhadi has succeeded in bringing out the true colors of each and every human and it is portrayed so brilliant by the characters on screen. Everyone of the cast deserves a huge applause for their perfect 10/10 acting skills. It was not just like watching a movie, but going places everywhere with each and every character and watching their activities.Even the youngest character in the movie, the small kid ('Somayeh' character) in the movie has done so well.The movie ideally explores the human and inhuman attitudes of all people. All the events in the movie seemed so real.We may just say a lie so easily, even if it were a serious thing. But the aftermath, is depicted so clearly and truthfully in the movie.The screenplay and dialogs were so good that I feel like these things can happen in anybody's life. Having seen many Hollywood movies, the one thing that always amuses me is that, most good dialogs in acclaimed movies,seem unreal to occur to the mind to such a person(the character) in such a condition (an exception being Tarantino's movie dialogs). But in this movie, the dialogs are so real,heart-felt and clear (I hope the subtitles with which I watched gave the correct translation).A superb movie with content that each and everyone of the family can watch.Great direction that makes you ask for more.And I feel bad for people who gave a negative review to this movie cos they are really nuts.Oscar worthy stuff and this movie should feature in the top 50 of every movie list ever made."
132,A Separation,10,17 January 2012,I love it,"I love it this is the best film from Iran A separation the best in the World I'm mainly writing this review to assure every non-Iranian IMDb-reader that you absolutely SHOULD see ""A Separation"". I will be shocked if this movie doesn't win an Academy Award. The acting is great, and the script is probably the best I've seen in five years. The genius of Asghar Farhadi's story is that it piles on the tension and drama without resorting to fireworks, trickery or shock and awe plot effects. It also manages to perfectly balance the plights of several protagonists. Very few screenwriters have this capacity.If this movie reminds me of anything, it is ""Ladri di Biciclette"" (Bicycle Thieves), which has a similar seemingly ""simple"" story setup. But then ""A Separation"" is much more developed, much more complex, much richer. Go see it."
133,A Separation,9,25 May 2012,Brilliant simple life of Iranians,"Hi all moviegoers...First of all, I just wanna say that this is a very nice movie indeed..This movie tells about a couple of husband and wife in the brink of a separation of their marriage.The flowing of the movie might give you mixed feelings.. either sad, disgust, angry, you name it..I only planned to see like 10-15 minutes of this movie, but I couldn't stop it, the movie is so great, the tense keep coming like a flow of a current..The movie makes me want to scream to all the 'liars' in this movie... argghh.. like something inside your stomach want to explode..congrats! Cheers from Indonesia, keep them coming! :D"
134,A Separation,10,31 March 2012,Separation awesome cinema,"From last few days i was waiting to watch this movie. And finally yesterday i made it. This is one of the best Iranian film i was till date. I does not mean that other Iranian movies are not so great but this one stands apart. This movie has everything best performance, best direction, best story etc etc it is perfect in all aspect of film making. This has everything in it love towards your family, thriller you will not feel like getting up from your seat. And most important it is an intelligent movie and it also the rich culture of Iran. Even if you are not interested in global cinema still you will love this movie. Watch it once you will not be able to get this out of your head."
135,A Separation,10,15 March 2012,Story about ordinary people yet so universal in its appeal.,"I believe the greatness of this movie lies in it's universality. Farhadi's masterful storytelling breaks all geographical and cultural barriers and allows us access to this world of pride, family values and religion finally leading to communication breakdown.The Story begins in a very innocuous manner and then catches the unsuspecting audience by surprise. One feature of this movie that makes it special is it approaches this intensely charged drama as a thriller. As we go deeper in the narrative the face of truth is peeled layer by layer and allows the viewer to be a part of all the events occurring on the screen. Performances are so good that I can assure you that you can mirror each character with people You know. Farhadi seems to have complete authority over this masterpiece.i don't want to reveal any plot details. All I want to say is If you like serious movies dealing with real people and you like 'Character Study'in movies then your wait is over. This is It. The one.If you like 'A Separation' then 'About Elly' is definitely recommended.At the end i would like to quote some lines from 'Schism' By 'Tool'.""Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion between supposed lovers, between supposed brothers."""
136,A Separation,10,2 March 2012,very good in story and acting,"Leila and Peyman were excellent in the fighting scene and Farhadi use his brilliant skill of directing to place them in right places. The scene that Hodjat hit himself was very emotional. we may think that it is very odd, but at the end when see whole movie, we can guess that is what is really happened in Iran. The setting was the best place in the whole world. Iran! which is show the world differences between their judge and the real thing in current. I think Farhadi is brave enough to face all probable problems, only to show what people suffer in current Tehran. The movie has a very deep emotion to show universal family problems, which may replace by other things instead of immigration and staying in homeland. I wish him the best, and I enjoy the film very much. Thanks."
137,A Separation,10,7 April 2013,For me A Separation is definitely one of the best films of 2011,"Hearing how highly regarded A Separation was among my IMDb friends, I knew I had to see it. My only question is how on earth did it take so long for me to do so? I can only put it down to being behind with my film watching because of uni, because A Separation is a fantastic film and deserves all ounces of praise it gets and some. That is my opinion though, because I know people will find that it is not their cup of tea and have no problem with that. What was it I loved about A Separation? A lot of things actually. It was a very well made film. The scenery is striking and authentic, and the cinematography is intrusive and relentlessly, but this adds to the impact of the story rather than detracts from it. Asghar Farhadi's direction similarly is supremely controlled. A Separation is remarkably written as well. The writing is intelligent and insightful, avoiding any kind of melodrama or moralising. Not just that but it succeeds also in exploring the characters without any kind of prejudice, and that is including Hodjat. The story is quite a complicated set-up, but compelling and moving. It gives the audience time to breathe, but with the tension and drama that fuels what is happening in the storytelling I found myself never being able to look away. The characters are sensitively explored, and while I've not seen About Elly in a while I do remember that I didn't relate as much to the characters there than I did here. The acting is wonderful, Leila Hatami(especially good), Peyman Moadi, Shahab Hosseini and Sareh Bayat give performances that wholly justified the sharing of the Silver Berlin Bear. One mustn't forget Sarina Farhadi, whose increasing intensity in her acting is what makes A Separation's storytelling and the case it depicts even more engrossing. In conclusion, one of the best of 2011, considering how hit and miss that year was for films that's saying a bit. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
138,A Separation,10,23 March 2013,One of the best movies ever.,"This movie won the 2011 Oscar for ""Best Foreign Film"", but really it should have won the Best Picture, as it was easily far better than ""The Artist"" or any of the other nominees that year.Instead it wasn't even nominated. WTF? From a completely prosaic and quotidian premise, we are treated to the unfolding of a wonderfully nuanced and complex morality tale. This is one of the very rare gems, where if I tried to describe to you what the movie was about, I'd just completely fail to impress you in any way, and yet you'd be blown away when you actually watch it. Just bloody hell watch it already if you haven't.The acting was also OUTSTANDING. From everyone. Even the teenage daughter."
139,A Separation,9,21 March 2012,A Nutshell Review: A Separation,"You should already know a little bit about the much talked about film by now, with a storyline that's fairly straightforward, betraying little of its layered statements about life, the relationships we keep as well as our individual survival instinct striving to be the fittest in the jungle, coupled with the self motivated, selfish interests we pursue, and all these performed regardless of age, gender or culture. It's what makes us human, flaws, warts and all, that A Separation transcends beyond its celluloid shelf life, and lives on, way past its closing credits, putting up a mirror in front of ourselves, that we see similar values and intrinsic human behaviour that transcends country, language and race, to show how basic and common we humans behave no matter where we are.It starts with an impending divorce, where we face the couple Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) squarely, and learn that their matrimonial life is on the rocks. She wants a divorce given that her husband doesn't want to uproot the family and live overseas in order to provide for a better life for their daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). He on the other hand finds this demand quite unreasonable, given his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) suffering from severe Alzheimer's Disease, and he being the filial son having to care for a parent who had brought him up and nurtured him. Things don't improve in this very long take, with voices escalating and each side relentless in their stressing upon their respective points of view, that it results in a stalemate of sorts, lose-lose to all in what couldn't be a mediation done successfully.Now with his wife moved out to live with his in-laws, Nader struggles with the daily chores, having to take care of a sick elderly as well as tend to the needs of a growing child, that he hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat) through a recommendation by Simin as domestic help, a woman who is deeply religious, and the first signs of cracks appear when she has to call up the religious authorities to find out if she can handle a man she's employed to look after. And the problems extend to her having a hot tempered husband to complicate matters, where Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) is heavy in debt and his being jailed causes what would be the catalyst to a series of events involving his wife's continued employment in Nader's household, Nader's father wandering off because of her inattention, and Razieh being forced out of Nader's apartment by the latter when Nader discovers some ill treatment to his dad, ultimately resulting in a miscarriage suffered by Razieh that Hodjat soon escalates to the courts.Much of what A Separation then deals with, is pretty unpleasant stuff. Unpleasant being that all characters start to rear their ugly head of self preservation, and we witness first hand a lesson on morality and ethics that Asghar Farhadi so brilliantly weaved into his screenplay, and direction that doesn't distract us from his casts' wonderful performances. We also witness, if this is to be believed and true, how the justice system works in Iran, where the magistrate more often than not makes some questionable requests for eyewitnesses, in a process that won't fly in many other courts around the world, since it is subjected to, and very open to corruption and compromise in very blatant ways, providing opportunity to the obstruction of justice or to cover up what would be the truth, meddling in it, and serving to confuse if necessary.But just is how the Truth is defined, is also what makes A Separation such an ace. We don't get to see what the sequence of events is either, and have to rely on accounts by those involved, and other eyewitnesses present. We watch how society is really male dominated, and that certain professions give you an edge in being trustworthy, or how class also plays a part in the decision making process. If you're of reputation, chances are your account will hold more weight, and the converse is true as well. If anything, it is a very pointed argument and case made against how things operate in country, and a call for change since the audience is forced into also making the same decisions based on information, and misinformation that permeates through society, with every party being very conscious about how their account will have impact on the persons they are talking about, and worse of course if there's vested interest in the status quo of certain relationships. The truth becomes how you argue it, and how you define and defend your version, skewed naturally, against other versions thrown in your direction.A Separation is not an easy film to sit through, because it is taxing as much as it is emotionally draining having to deal with so much negativity that the characters display. Everyone is constantly raising their voices to force their points across with arguments getting very long drawn out affairs, and you're bound to notice characteristics you see in others, as well as oneself, that makes it really uncomfortable for cutting so close to home. But Asghar Farhadi forces you to acknowledge the truth in our selves, and by and large A Separation is a very well made film for its solid production, ending it in the best way possible and that's to be open for discussion and discourse. It requires patience and endurance, and is recommended stuff!"
140,A Separation,10,27 January 2012,This is a great Drama film,"This is the best Drama Film If mainstream cinema leaves you soulless, see this film.If you have a modicum of intelligence, see this film.If you like great acting and directing, see this film.If you like great writing and editing, see this film.If you have an interest in law, see this film.If you are a parent, see this film.I'm an Iranian, but I've never been interested in Iranian cinema. I only watch Iranian films when they win awards or receive international recognition. I'm a fan of Kiarostami and Majidi, but I can't really say that I like all of their films. I watched Farhady's previous film (About Elly) about a year ago, and the first thing which struck me was how culturally detached the movie was in its depiction of an event. At the time, I believed this to have been the cause of this director's success. Watching Nader and Simin, however, proved that I was terribly mistaken.Asghar Farhady's obsession with the concept of judgment is once again the driving force behind his latest feature. The life-like depiction of the Iranian courtroom (which is in no way impartial) places the audience in the Judge's seat from the very beginning. The extremely believable acting and insanely complex script compel the viewer to make up his/her mind just like when reading a court case. As for the screenplay, I'm almost certain the events in this film actually happened in real life, because in no way could one fabricate such a chaotically complex series of events, so beautifully woven into a coherent whole.Despite being very Iranian in its narrative style and its depiction of Iranian culture (the sanctity of Family, faith, commitment towards parents and married life), I believe that this film could easily appeal to the Western audiences just like a film by Inaritu or Haneke (although I'm pretty sure it won't be nominated for an Oscar for political reasons).After seeing About Elly, I thought Farhady's success was just a one-time fling, but coming out of the theater, having watched Nader and Simin, I was proud to have another Iranian director added to my international list of favorites."
141,A Separation,10,25 January 2012,Timeless Tragedy,"A Separation is so deeply moving, so human, that it feels downright blasphemous to be enthusiastic about it. I wish I could write a review with just the words ""go see this movie"" in it. But since I can't do that, you should consider the rest of this review as nothing but context.A Separation is an Iranian movie with three large female roles. It's the sort of description that might make you think it's a political allegory, or at least a movie with some pretty hefty subtext. Nothing could be further from the truth. None of the characters in the movie worry about politics. They have their own problems to deal with. This might have become hypocritical in an Iranian movie, but it actually works as a strong point. The characters don't represent their gender, social class or religion. They just represent themselves, and are plenty busy with that. It makes the outcome of the movie purely based on the actions of persons, not on the side of any one issue the filmmaker wants to impose on us. Let's not forget, after all, that even some of the most repressed people in the world still have to find their own ways to get along with one another. A government can only set the conditions under which people have to live. With what kind of misery the citizens fill in the blanks is up to them. Nader and Termeh return home one day to find the old man alone in the house. He has fallen from his bed and is tied to the bedstand. He doesn't seem to be breathing. Termeh loses it, while Nader quickly puts him back on the bed. He is still alive. Razieh sneaks into the house. Nader flips out. He throws Razieh and her daughter out the door and slams it shut. He walks back to his father, but then hears noises outside and checks what is happening. Razieh has fallen down the stairs, and some neighbors are helping her up. Nader returns to his father. Later that day, Simin calls him. He rings at her mothers door, who looks at him with a look of ill-hidden contempt. Nader tries to start talking, but Simin cuts him off and tells him that Raziehs husband had called and insulted her. She asks him to explain himself. He says he doesn't know what she is talking about. She tells him Razieh is in the hospital. They rush there. Razieh has had a miscarriage.At this point we've finally reached the central conflict of the rest of the movie. Was it or was it not Nader's fault? It might sound like a simple question of guilt, but everyone involved views the situation differently. Nader wants to protect Termeh. Simin doesn't know whether to trust Nader anymore and wants to find out the truth. Razieh is heartbroken at the loss of her child. Raziehs husband is unemployed, depressed and ill-tempered, and the loss of his son feels like a final draw to him. Each one of them tries to handle the situation as well as they can, but how well can a situation like this be handled anyway? Morality is a lot more complicated when the future of your family is at stake. The lives of people who just want to be left in peace to sort out their personal problems get entangled further and further. Even the judge seems to find the situation exasperating. Although the atmosphere of A Separation is something I've never seen on the screen, it still felt familiar. I've seen it in other places; At the family dining table during my parents divorce. In restaurants where couples at other tables got into a fight. In the company of old people who recount the tales of woe from their lives. A Separation snubs the melodramatic for something a lot more direct: the truth. It doesn't rely on the sort of tension that gets you to the edge of your seat. It works by means of different kind of tension. The sort that slowly builds in your shoulders during a time of stress, the sort you don't even notice until it's too late. The kind of tension that can simmer in you for days, months, even years, before making you explode. The tension of life.You have read over a thousand words at this point, and I have written and scraped many more. And there is so much more that can be said about the movie. How good the screenplay is, and how great the acting. How beautiful the Farsi dialogues sounded. How much the movie resonated with me personally. But all of that is secondary. The main thing is that this movie works because it's real. Go see it. It will stay with you for the rest of your life."
142,A Separation,,26 December 2011,definitely worth watching,"The movie is so fast moving that before you realize what is going on it takes you to the next unpredictable step. Every character has done a brilliant job and it is to the credit of the director that we don't feel they are acting. Very absorbing and emotional film, with nice camera work and superb editing. The dilemma of the lady who comes to help and look after the aged father with Alzheimers and the tight corner she gets into are brilliantly portrayed. The daughter's questions and concerns take the film to deep levels of empathy and touch an emotional cord. And the end leaves you in awe.  Definitely worth watching.My rating: ( 8 out of 10)"
143,A Separation,10,13 April 2011,It's a great movie,"I've seen this film just 4 days ago in cinema and I think 'Jodaeiye Nader AZ Simin' Is one of the best movies which I've ever seen. I give 100 from 100 score to this movie And I invite all Iranian and all the people around the world to see this great DRAMA movie and I individually thanks million from the respected director; ASGHAR FARHADI; to make such a wonderful dramatic movie. I appreciate SHAHAB HOSYNI , LEYLA HATAMI, PEYMAN MA'ADI and SAREH BAYAT to playing one of their best roles in this unique movie. These days, in my country most of the people go to cinema to see this movie and almost all of them are satisfied by it. If we had such as this movie in our country more, we would be one one of the greatest movie makers in the world. However our directors are restricted by lot's of limitations like 'VEZARATE FARHANG VA ERSHAD ESLAMI, they try to do the best and make the best film. From Iranian's directors I like ASGHAR FARHADI, BAHMAN GHOBADI, ABBAS KIA ROSTAMI and ALI HATAMI. from Iranian's actors I like SHAHAB HOSEYNI, HAMED BHDAD va BAHRAM RADAN. from Iranian actress I like GOLSHIFTEH FARAHANI, MAHTAB KERAMATI, HEDYEH TEHRANI, LEYLA HATAMI and TARANEH ALI-DUSTI."

145,A Separation,1,8 December 2012,An Oscar....really?  Overrated.,"I thought for sure this would be a good movie as a ranking of 8.5 would imply so. Not even close. A Separation is boring with a horrible storyline. I have no idea how this movie is within the rankings of other great films. I almost turned it off within the first 20-30 minutes but held on for a great ending that never was. I will not be joining the bandwagon on this one. Don't waste your time watching it.I will sum up the storyline for what it is and not try to poetically warp this mess. The wife wants to move, the husband wants to stay to take care of his elderly father, the young daughter gets caught in the middle of the parents quarrels, the caretaker chains the elderly father to the bed and leaves the house for the day, and then she blames her miscarriage on the husband when in reality she ran into the street only to be hit by a car, go figure. Now repeat the same storyline over and over."
146,A Separation,2,28 May 2012,A  yawn  separation  yawn  is hardly about  a separation,"Probably one of the most boring movies I ever watched in my life. Even the title is misleading, because only the first and last scene have something to do with the actual separation. We see Simin (the wife) and Nader (the husband) in front of a judge debating the reasons why they want to split. Actually, Simin wants to split, Nader seems not to care one way or the other  which certainly does not give much motivation to continue a marriage.The two have a child  Termeh - who is staying with Nader, while Simin moved back with her family, waiting for Termeh to decide if she wants to leave the country with her or stay with Nader. After the introduction of the main characters, the story derails. The in-between two hours of excruciating boredom are filled with the story of Razieh, an ignorant and over-religious woman hired to take care of Nader's father, who suffers from Alzheimer and is the main reason why Nader wants to stay put.Razieh makes a total mess out of a relatively simple job and ends up creating more trouble for herself and everybody around her, including her jobless and irresponsible husband.What has this to do with the separation of the title? Little or nothing. The movie goes on and on about Razieh and her troubles, loosing track of the alleged main characters. To make it worse, even the ending is a total let-down. A smug, ""I-am-clever-than-you"" joke played on the audience. Therefore, ""A separation"" starts slowly and goes nowhere just as slow, in a fake-documentary style.I am sure such a story based in Europe or the US would not have won an Oscar, but it is not the first time  nor will be the last  that a movie wins a prize for obscure reasons that have nothing to do with cinematography.Finally, I read some of the other reviews mentioning ""tension and drama"", ""phenomenal"", "" best movie of the year"" and more gushing and hyperbolic positive remarks. Probably they refer to another movie, or the audience fell asleep and dreamt about tension and drama that are not to be found in this one."
147,A Separation,2,21 May 2013,A bizarre and pointless film that refuses to work within its limitations and suffers badly for it,"The premise is simple enough; A woman wants to split from her husband in order to leave the country since he won't leave with her in order to care for his terminally ill father.But as soon as we clear the premise the film drops the subject completely and instead meanders off to tell us about a comically inept housekeeper, her irresponsible husband and the laughable nature of the Iranian justice system that attempts to make sense of the mess. Except nothing is played for laughs.It completely baffles my mind why this film wasn't more focused on its central plot, instead we get a badly paced debacle that feels a lot longer than it is. Every scene looks the same, sounds the same and plays out more or less the same with very few exceptions. It quickly becomes obvious no care at all was given to ways in which set design, audio and environmental cues could be used to move the film along.If this were a school project I'd be impressed, there's solid acting and the basic shot structure is competent. But judged as a film that won an academy award I must say it's highly overrated, especially when all the missed opportunities are taken into consideration."
148,A Separation,,17 June 2012,A must watch film,"This film is about an Iranian woman who asks for divorce from her husband, and its resultant repercussions.""A Separation"" starts off very intense, as the woman fiercely battles for a divorce in front of a judge. She does not fear the authority, even if the culture and social norms are against her. This remarkable opening is impressive, and I can safely say that this momentum is maintained throughout the rest of the film The plot is followed by a battle of morality and self interest. The two couples concerned all react differently to the situation, sparking an interesting character analysis. What seemingly decent individuals would do to protect their honour and self interest, and how far desperate individuals would fight for perceived justice. These complex character portrayals are so engrossing and through provoking. There is not a moment of slack. The ending twist is surprising, and adds to the brilliance of this film. ""A Separation"" is a must watch film."
149,A Separation,,24 February 2012,Multiple Splits,"""The most common lie is that which one lies to himself; lying to others is relatively an exception."" Friedrich Nietzsche The Iranian selection to the 2012 Oscars, A Separation, is a rich character study of slow-moving catastrophe for a family that just can't avoid trouble. Although the film captures some of the cultural forces in contemporary Iran, it is much more about how individual choices can change everyone. Its Golden Globe and Berlin Film Festival Golden Bear awards are well deserved.A married couple must choose the future but alas not the same one. Simin hopes to go with her husband and daughter to live abroad to improve their life. Husband Nader will not leave his Alzheimer-afflicted father. Divorce is the only choice.Thus begins their journey through the courts, whose judges are prone to invoke cultural and personal criteria in making their choices. In the course of the tightly-framed mise en scene, and believe me both director Asghar Farhadi and Iranian living circumstances make it claustrophobic, other characters become involved in the split so that the courtroom occupies the stage for confrontations with potentially devastating results.Woven into this compact hornets' nest are themes of class distinctions that drive those decisions (one couple is middle-class comfortable and the other is poor), family loyalties (for instance, daughter is forced to lie for dad and to make a choice about which parent to live with), and the secrets and lies that irrevocably shape all lives. A Separation starts with a husband and wife splitting and ends with separations of multiple families.Now that's theater worthy of the big screen, where the smallest decision is writ large."
150,A Separation,10,4 March 2012,Monumental movie! A must see,"""A Separation"" is an excellent movie! It has an amazing complexity and simplicity intertwined at the same time. I believe the story is universal and would speak to people of all cultures. It is a very emotional movie. The actors are also excellent. Although the actual story is trivial, the director has managed to create an original, intriguing and powerful storyline. I did like the open ending as well.I highly recommend this movie. I believe the movie definitely deserved the Oscar as will as the 45 other prizes it gas won. Farhadi is a genius. The 11 yo Termeh is the director's daughter and she performs beautifully on par with the other actors."
151,A Separation,5,14 March 2014,I am shocked by the rating!,"I did not see one shred of entertainment. I believe the high ratings are for the acting, not for the plot. I will present a plot summary as evidence. This movie is about Nader, whose wife divorces him, so he hires a caretaker for his sick father to avoid missing work. The caretaker is negligent so she is fired, but she refuses to leave the house without pay. Nader pushes the caretaker out the door. She has a miscarriage and files criminal murder charges against him. Nader also files charges for the mistreatment of his father. Everyone in the movie lies about the circumstances surrounding the criminal charges. Subsequently, all charges are dropped, and Nader goes back to focusing on his divorce and custody battle. I will admit that the caretaker, her husband, and Nader's daughter performed their roles phenomenally. But this plot is just not juicy enough to film a movie about. There were so many filler scenes, like watching Nader's daughter read, watching the sick dad sit in confusion, and watching everyone sit in the courthouse with their heads down. If the plot had some substance, then the viewer wouldn't end up watching people do boring things. 5/10 for the acting and realism, but I still would not recommend this."
152,A Separation,10,5 February 2017,It puts the D in Drama,"This is what all drama films should be. I went into this movie not knowing anything. The intro credits showed some names, I didn't recognize a single one of them. Doesn't matter.I take it back, this film is what all movies should be. It's built around a script and a solid story, not on bankable names, famous faces and such. It's a story about something entirely new, not something that is en vogue right now (zombies, terrorism, vampires, etc.) It tells a universal story, one of marriage and divorce, one of loyalty to one's principles or to one's family, making the characters having to choose between very difficult choices - father or wife for Nader, mother or father for his daughter, debtor's jail and financial ruin or blood money and sin, truth or lies, and all the dancing in the gray in the middle.This film is specifically set in a particular context, modern-day Iran, not something that is set in anywhereville, devoid of any references, nor does it choose Iran just as a backdrop to tell a story. Iran, its culture and legal system, is the setting and so the characters have to play within the rules of that game. Iran here is the chessboard. Setting the story elsewhere would've made it an entirely different film, even if the ideas of this film are universal.There are so many layers here - a legal system that puts the accusers and defendants front and center without any lawyers, courts that do swear in witnesses before testimony, letting them tell the court the truth, half-truths and lies with the judge to decide, there's the legal power of the judge to hold people in contempt but also the informal power of people to beg for clemency, there's a completely informal, cultural system of settlements done outside the legal system, then there's religion and the Quran, where defendants who may lie to their spouses, friends or the court system have serious reservations about lying under oath or accepting blood money.Note: The subtitles I read used the word ""blood money"" to refer to the payment made by a defendant to a victim or victim's family to settle a case, in this case a miscarriage. The term ""blood money"" is also used (in some translations) for bad or cursed money that was gained through criminal means or deceit. In this case, the victim refused to accept a settlement because she could not swear under oath that she lost her fetus in the confrontation. Lying under oath would, in this culture, risk her living daughter's health or well-being. You do not need to know all these cultural details because the film presents them to you, not in an expositional way, but in a real life way. ""I can't take that (bad) money, what if something happens to my daughter?"" The intertwining of all these layers, customs, laws and traditions, makes this a really interesting story. A purely legal drama done with courts and lawyers would not have been that interesting. A purely mediator-based story about two parties arguing for settlement would not have been better. I wish more filmmakers would watch this film and learn. I see a lot of mediocre films and directors hiding behind the excuse of small budgets."
153,A Separation,7,30 June 2015,This is Iran!,"A married couple are faced with a difficult decision - to improve the life of their child by moving to another country or to stay in Iran and look after a deteriorating parent who has Alzheimer's disease.There are not many well-known Iranian films, and this one came out of nowhere and blew everyone away. Mostly, because I think it challenged people's expectations of what Iran can be. And when I say people, I mean Americans, who probably think of Iran as a harsh, backwards place rather than the cultural center it is.The story itself is a great one, and it should come as no surprise that an Oscar nomination for best screenplay followed it (a great achievement for a foreign film). Again, being Iranian surely helped... this is a story that strikes at the heart of expectations and shows just how modern many Muslims are. (This should not be a shock, but somehow for many people it still is.)"
154,A Separation,10,4 April 2015,"you'll leave feeling so many things - maybe, a little, hope","A Separation is a film by Asghar Farhadi that keeps things to being about the personal - what it means to be a married couple, apart, and still being a family unit, or units. How does one give care to a loved one, especially if they're older and unaware where they are (as happens to the old grandfather in this film)? What about how things don't happen on-a-dime, so to speak, but feelings of betrayal and distrust grow eventually, piece by piece? In Farhadi's hands, and through his actors, people are trying to figure things out, trying to make sense of the people around them, about the trust, about people's behaviors, about things that can be taken for granted like love. There's not much, if at all, sentimentality in this approach, which makes it so affecting and effective.This is deeply felt and raw, no punches pulled filmmaking. The intensity comes off the screen in a direct way, piling on as it's a story where there are no clear ""good guys"" or ""villains"" take place. Even characters you'd think are more conniving than others have their reasons and dimensions, like the maid's family.This wouldn't be a script for a screen writing class. It's like life - complicated by what people try to do, when they do the wrong things but try to make them right, and visa-versa. It was also wise for Farhadi to not feature any music in the film until the end credits - it's almost as if we're finally released from the grip of the drama... and yet it's at a moment where we're on edge for what will happen next.Featuring Hatami and Moadi's soulful, harrowing performances, for Farhadi, by the end, he has another story being suggested to tell, probably one too painful to bear. It's about... well, it's about love, and compassion, and faith, not all having to do with religion (though it may pop up, just in the subtext). It's an ""M"" word: 'masterpiece'."
155,A Separation,9,14 November 2014,Morally complex and gripping,"This is my first film from the Middle East (Iran, specifically), and I am amazed at the dramatic complexity and commitment to realism that Asghar Farhadi created in A SEPARATION. The story concerns a couple who divorces when the mother wants to leave Iran, but the father decides to stay behind with his Alzheimer's-suffering father. What follows is a compelling drama about divorce and its effect on the people involved, even how it can reach beyond the immediate family. There are many other complex issues discussed, and all of it is through the lens of Muslim culture, which I found fascinating. Thematically, the central issue is about making tough decisions in the context of a culture where religion and government are so intertwined. As far as acting is concerned, it was some of the best I've ever seen. Every performer gave their all, and it felt like I was watching a documentary with real people. This tone was also reinforced by the hand-held camera-work and (until the closing credits) a lack of music. Overall, this is not just one of the best foreign films I've ever seen, but one of the best period. The only minor issue I take is the rather ambiguous ending, but after watching the problems that the characters go through for two hours, it's probably just my personal desire for a more clear-cut resolution. Overall, if you love foreign films or complex, realistic dramas then give this a try."
156,A Separation,1,1 September 2012,Overrated and boring,"This movie has a 8.5 rating so we thought let's give it a try. As with many of these kind of movies the initial high rating is based upon an political correct crowd voting high as an ""socio political statement"". After watching this movies for 30 minutes it became long and boring. I don't understand what's good about this movie... It's just an boring long conflict between 2 families dragging on for almost 2 hours. If there was one message i got from all this it is Iranian people inflate little problems and solve them like little kids. These kind of movies don't deserve Oscars or other prices, just because it's made in a country like Iran doesn't make it good."
157,A Separation,8,29 January 2012,"Good, very good, even, but I don't see the greatness that everyone else apparently does","I'm having a hard time reviewing this film. I just can't help weighing my reaction to films against the consensus. It seems shallow, because, the thing is, I found this to be a very good film, but, compared to the general reaction, I found it merely that and not ""OMG BEST MOVIE EVERRRR!!!!"" The film is quite complex. Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) have reached an impasse in their marriage. She wants to leave the country with her daughter, but Nader cannot consider it at this point, because he's taking care of his disabled, Alzheimer's suffering father. After Simin leaves Nader, he must find someone to take care of his father while he is at work and his daughter is at school. Having little money with which to hire someone, he hits upon a desperate, pregnant woman, Razieh (Sareh Bayat), whose husband, Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), is unemployed. Hodjat is the one Nader wants to take care of his father (Razieh is, for religious reasons, not allowed to physically engage the old man when he needs to use the bathroom or whatever), but Razieh must do it for the first few days. Unfortunately, she's unable to handle to huge responsibilities that come with the job, and she quickly runs into some horrible troubles. Those horrible troubles lead to other horrible troubles, and soon she and her husband are in court suing Nader, with Nader counter-suing them. In some ways, the film plays like a really good episode of Iranian Law & Order. That's definitely of great interest, because Iranian courts are quite different than our own (some may say more corrupt, but, honestly, probably not by much; I think a lot of this situation would play identically if it happened in the United States). While the issues presented are quite interesting, and the moral and class issues are entertaining to contemplate, I had some fundamental problems with the story. First, no matter which way you slice it, Simin comes off as a terrible human being. Nader would have agreed to leave with her and their daughter if he hadn't been forced to take care of his father. Presumably, if Simin was still with Nader, she'd be the one caring for the old man. Now, we all know how much that would suck, but Simin really couldn't help take care of the father for a year or two until he passed? Instead, she dumps the entire crappy situation on her husband (and daughter, whom she wants to steal away, too) to deal with on his own. The film never provides Simin with a realistic reason for making this decision, instead treating her like she's being reasonable, just because the director wants to seem unbiased. And then there's the whole issue of the lower class Razieh and Hodjat. Without spoiling the story, I must say, I was always entirely on Nader's side for the whole court case. Sure, he made some poor decisions, but the accusations against him are fairly unjust. The film gives him some baggage when he lies about a key element of the story, but, really, the lies seem pretty minor compared to the other side's lies. It's all very intriguing, but, I must ask, where is this ""BEST FILM EVER!"" stuff coming from? It's very blandly filmed in a hand-held documentary style, with maybe only one or two good shots and edits. The performances are pretty good, especially Peyman Moadi. All in all, though, good, but nothing revolutionary."
158,A Separation,1,16 January 2013,most overrated film of all time,"I have watched this film 3 times now and can't believe how it could be rated so high. l have tried so hard to like it but there's nothing there. Gave it a 1 so the rating could be brought down. It should never occupy the space it does with so many other amazing films through history. Its probably a 4 at most. This boring piece or pretentious crap makes you wish there was a murder suicide starting with the daughter. So many other Iranian films are so much better, let alone world movies of that year. If you need to beat insomnia here's your pill. Only some decent acting from the lead actors give it some credence. Anyone that thinks this is a real slice of life has not lived a real life.

159,A Separation,10,7 April 2011,prejudiced . movie . and IMDb,"a prejudice ? is it new ? is it particular for Iranians? Farhadi with this movie showed that a bout Eli wasn't a fortune accident . i don't think it was a brilliant movie but it was a movie from Iran and it was a bout Iranians , justice , and a middle class family . Nader doesn't agree with his wife idea for immigration because he cant leave his sick father alone. so Simin asks for divorce ..... and my opinion a bout film's rating : IMDb is a site to express you're feelings a bout movies. and i think any one is free in his vote . it doesn't matter that you didn't like the movie because IMDb has made a very simple way to show you're objection . you can vote as other do . if you didn't like the movie , it doesn't mean that its a bad movie . i don't support to make cinema a political place ...but i believe every one is free to express his opinion and you don't get to say what movie deserves what ......"
160,A Separation,7,1 February 2012,Refreshing original Cinema,"I believe one of the main causes that make us award the so called ""Foreign movie"" is their fresh cultural perspective of life that it adds to the cinema heritage. we can't but appreciate and honor those who present us this great gift to cinema combining it with artistic achievement. and that was the case with Fahradi and his (A Separation). the Iranian cinema is well known of it's excellent cinema, even though it could be regarded globally as not popular, but I believe that the effort made such as the one in ""a separation"" shades a lot of light to this original cinema. A separation is an original movie, I guess that at less is a fact beyond discussion. It's simply had every thing a good movie can present; it's engaging, vivid, well written, and had a marvelous acting cast and screenplay.. the movie is a social drama prospect, a movie that forges out questions more than answers, and even though it puts the audience form the first scene in the judge chair,I don't believe that was to ask for our presumption or judgment, rather it seeks to have us only as a witnesses. As audience we are in a very difficult position in this case, for the fact that we witness a very complicated case of constant dispute between the couples Simin and Nadar over their daughter, and then it got more complicated when another couple shows up and accuse Nadar to be the cause of the wife apportion. I should admit that, the intensity of the movie may bather me a little bit, because it keeps the one intense all through the movie, in fact we may notice that the movies scenario is built mainly on these disputing dialogs. Yet, there's so much things fascinated me as well, the things that attracts me the most was first of all is the screenplay; the camera shouts are very intentional and expressive,the acting is superb, thank god not over reacted nether cold and flat, a thing even great movies slip in sometimes. the writing and scenario deserve no doubt an award, because event thought the story is basically simple and linear, the movie's threads are well compose, so it may keep the ones breath on hold to the last minuet of the play. No doubt Fahradi presents a very committed serious cinema, and the best testimony of this fact is its frequent understatement such as ""-I'd prefer that my child do not grow up under these circumstances, as a mother I has this right -under what conditions? what conditions ma'am??"" the work as a whole implies a lot of figurative elements, and could bears a lot of different interpretations. at last I guess I have to say something about the thematic point of the work, as a social drama, the movie presents two ways of life that we might lead and leaves to us and Terma (the daughter) to chose between them, which are; ""N- she had to stay to learn! S- to learn about what stubbornness and confrontations! N- No, so she could learn not to be cowered like u!!"" what dazzle me the most in these dialogs is it's strikingly honesty. the ending of the movie leave the parents at the door of the court room waiting to know the decision of their daughter of which of them she will chose to live with... who would you think she'll chose? what would' you chose?"
161,A Separation,10,31 January 2013,Magnificent.,"In the opening sequence of Asghar Farhadi's terrific film, we see a couple, who are about to get divorced, sitting quietly. And then, without warning, the terse conversation about their lives and family escalates into a fire-spewing argument. The camera sensibly does not focus anywhere else during that sequence and after everything is said and done, every argument is brushed upon, the scene cuts away, not before vividly capturing the animosity between its lead characters. And that one sequence merits a deserving round of applause for Farhadi's 'A Separation', a scorchingly intense drama about conscience and moral ethics. Farhadi tactfully dissects the human mind by challenging us to confront ourselves as human beings with his beauty of a script and immensely complex characters but breathes real emotions while tension sears through the tightly-wound plot. It's something miraculous this, for the film is something so familiar because these are like the characters we have encountered at some point in our lives and we have heard them have conversations like the ones they have in the film. Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) have been married for fourteen years and have a 11-year old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). Tensions arise in their marriage when Simin decides o shift abroad for the sake of providing their daughter with a better life which Nader isn't willing to accept. He wants to stay in Iran to care for his father who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Frustrated by her husband's lack of interest, Simin decides to stay with her mother for a while. In her absence, Nader hires a pregnant caretaker Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father while he's working. One day, when Razieh has to leave the house on some urgent business, she ties Nader's father up to prevent him from leaving the house. When Nader returns only to find his father's condition has worsened because of Razieh's actions, he pushes her in a fit of rage. What happens next changes the lives of everyone involved. Apart from being a drama about the disintegration of a relationship, the film could also be passed off as a suspense-thriller, solely because of the sharp wit Farhadi so wonderfully weaves into the tense setting. Of the rousing babel that breaks at many points throughout the film, Farhadi is able to articulate himself through his writing, because the characters emote the precise emotions we expect them to. The film intently tries to comprehend the reasons for the actions of the characters it talks about and that's one skill that's hard to perfect. The direction is top-notch, because Farhadi is a remarkable observer of little details. Of the performances, Peyman Moaadi and Shahab Hosseini, who plays Razieh's debt-ridden husband, are standout. Moaadi, playing the grim father and husband, is outstanding. Leila Hatami, who is left out for most of the film, does supremely well in a small role. Sareh Bayat hands in a convincing performance of a complex character and it's easy to relate to her portrayal of a grieving mother.As far as dramas go, 'A Separation' is a nearly-perfect one, and an intelligent film that tragically depicts the depths human nature can sink to, if provoked. It's one film that can compel you to change the way you look at yourself. It's fascinating to see how a few well-chosen words and characters can chisel you into a better human being."
162,A Separation,10,8 January 2013,One of the most intense movies I've ever seen....Films like this are the reason why i love foreign cinema.!!!,"THIS FILM IS TRULY A MASTERPIECE!!!This is one of the best movies I've ever seen in a very long time!!The acting was incredible!!!!!!!!!Totally deserved the award, Even though the storyline isn't that interesting , the SENSATIONAL acting made me dying to know what's gonna happen next !!Recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it yet ! just see it and you won't regret it !!!I wish more people in the world knew about this film.who cares about Hollywood ,true﻿ cinema is out thereHighly Recommend."
163,A Separation,10,22 August 2012,"'What is wrong is wrong, no matter who said it or where it's written.'","A SEPARATION is a profoundly moving film from Iran, written and directed by Asghar Farhadi, acted by a truly gifted cast of artists, and a film that dares to dig deeply into so many issues that are not only serving to enlighten the world about conditions in Iran, but also to make us each reevaluate our feelings about family, faith, love, responsibility, parenting, and surviving in a world that often seems incompatible with life as we once knew it. One of the reasons the film works so intensely well is the directors ignoring the outside influences of musical score and cinematic effects, instead relying on person to person communication in claustrophobic confines that drives the story in an almost breathless pace that heightens the drama.Briefly, the story deals with husband and wife Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) who are arguing about living abroad. Simin prefers to live abroad to provide better opportunities for their only daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). However, Nader refuses to go because he thinks he must stay in Iran and takes care of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who suffers from Alzheimers. So committed is Simin to make this escape from the confines and turmoil of Iran that she decides to get a divorce and leave the country with her daughter. Nadar must work at the bank to support his father and Termeh who has decided to stay home in Iran with her father, so he hires a caregiver Razieh (Sareh Bayat) who comes to work with her 6 year old daughter: Razieh is pregnant, her unemployed cobbler husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) is in and out of debtors prison, and in general Hodjat and Razieh represent the agony of the struggling lower class. Razieh cannot cope with caring for the Alzheimer victim, stressors occur, Nader throws Razieh out of his house when he discovers his father's lack of care, and in the struggle Razieh has a miscarriage. The remainder of the film is the struggle between the two couples - middle class Nader and Simin and poverty lower class Razieh and Hodjat. The audience is placed in the 'courtroom' (actually a simple confrontation with a judge) concerning divorce, the accident that turns a miscarriage into an accusation of murder, and the battle between the two couples, which is a battle between classes. Religious issues are raised: philosophical issues are in focus. From all of these incidents we learn more about the current standards of life in Iran than any book has shared.It is rare when a film leaves the audience speechless. This one does.

164,A Separation,10,22 August 2012,I heard it was good...but not THIS good,"As most will understand through the trailer, A Separation is about a couple preparing for a divorce but getting mixed up in a mistake the husband made. As the film crawls closer and closer to the conclusion, you're literally at the edge of your seat as new evidence are introduced, as the family is struggling with the court room situation and their own situation, and as we come to finding out the secrets everyone is trying to hide from the court. There's no way to describe how intriguing this film is, and even in the last seconds of the film, you're still at the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. Undeniably a Oscar worthy film, the Iraqians have proved that the U.S. is not alone in the film industry. I'm hoping to see more films like this: intense, stressful, and emotional, minus all the sex, violence, substance use, and profanity. One issue people might have is the lack of music, but the quiet atmosphere nonetheless makes this film even more gut-wrenching. An excellent film indeed, now take my advice and see it!"
165,A Separation,9,3 May 2012,Do you like dram?,"Hope,dram,separation... I think,the film is more dramatic than other İranian films.Film is excellent.Do you like dram?,if you answer is ""yes"" you must watch this film.İf you have a family you must watch this film.Film's scenario is very good ,so the movie won Oscar.Movie is give us information about İrian social life.I think Sareh BAYAT is the best player in movie.The film's ending music is very good and impressive.At the end of the film,I say myself ""I love my family and they are very important for me.Asghar FARHADİ written and directed by this film.I think,the film is teaching us ""Cheats never prosper"""
166,A Separation,9,26 April 2012,An amazing movie. One of the best I've ever seen,"I have never been as tense watching a movie as when I watched ""A Separation"". But is not a political thriller or an action movie filled with car chases. When we watch those types of movies we know that the events we see will never happen to us so we can sit back and enjoy them.I think the reason I got so ""into"" this movie is that the events portrayed in it very easily could happen to me or my friends and family. It is basically a domestic drama, starting with a marriage breakdown.The amazing opening scene shows an Iranian woman and her husband speaking to a judge. She wants a divorce as she has a visa to settle in another country but he says he can't leave, as he has to look after his elderly father, who has Alzheimer's. It's sadly obvious that their relationship has completely broken down. The judge doesn't agree to the divorce but the wife goes to live with her mother. Their teenage daughter decides to stay with her father and he employs woman to look after his father when there is no one else at home.From there on a series of seemingly insignificant events have major consequences. Giving any more details of the plot might spoil your enjoyment of the movie.However if you have ever had a sick relative, been angry at your spouse/partner, been unhappy with work someone has done for you or told a lie for what you thought was a good reason I think this movie will affect you greatly."
167,A Separation,10,12 March 2012,Great domestic drama from Iran,"The Iranian film ""Jodaeiye Nader az Simin"" was shown in the U.S. with the title ""A Separation"" (2011). The movie was written and directed by Asghar Farhadi. ""A Separation"" won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. It has also won many, many awards in film festivals around the world.The movie is a domestic drama in which there are no heroes and no villains. Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moadi) are a middle-class couple who appear to have a good relationship and a decent life. Matters begin to unravel because Simin wants to emigrate ""for a better life for their child,"" and Nader feels compelled to remain at home. Nader's father, played superbly by Ali-Asghar Shahbaz, has advanced Alzheimer's disease, and needs constant care. Ultimately, Simin moves out of the apartment, and matters go seriously downhill from there. Although, obviously, major differences exist between Iranian culture and U.S. culture, the movie is really universal. Without the language difference and the women's headscarves, this film could be taking place in the U.S. No one wants trouble, but once given an opening, trouble finds them. Each attempt to improve the situation brings only more trouble. Even if this type of serious discord has never happened to us, we can see and understand how it happened to this couple, and we can realize that none of us is immune.""A Separation"" has not only received critical acclaim, but it has been popular with audiences as well. As I write this review, the IMDb rating is an astonishing 8.6, putting the movie within the category of ""Top 100 Films."" To my amazement, a Rochester, NY reviewer found the film overly long and dull. His additional criticism--the movie didn't deal with Iran's nuclear program, and with the imminent threat of attack by Israel and/or the U.S. Apparently, the reviewer doesn't realize that most people, in most countries, most of the time, are caught up in their own lives and their own problems. When your father has Alzheimer's disease, and your wife has left you, those problems are where you put your energy. Foreign policy takes a back seat. This is a realistic domestic drama about realistic problems. That's its strength, not its weakness. It's a great film, and it's not boring! Don't miss it."
168,A Separation,1,15 October 2012,Disappointed,"I was very excited to see this foreign film as I am a big fan of non-Hollywood movies. I saw the movie thinking it had a fresh and different theme for an Iranian movie. Most of the Iranian films I've seen relate to religion and traditions in the Arabic countries. I was also surprised to see Iranian women having a very different life style- The last Iranian movie I saw was ""The Stoning of Soraya."" Again, I was pleased to see a different movie. The photography was also great. The actors performances were very realistic. The grandfather really looked as if he was suffering of Alzheimer. However, I was really disappointed with the ending of this story. I was left with the feeling of an unfinished product. Who did the girl choose to live with? Whatever happen with all the lies told by the everyone involved in the abortion? What about the poor grandpa? Is the woman going to leave the country with her daughter? Did they finally get divorced? Anyway, very disappointed."
169,A Separation,7,14 May 2016,My first Iranian film,"This is a powerful character-driven film about how the destruction of one family. It explores how every member of one Iranian family are affected by living with someone suffering from Alzheimer's disease. This is a delicate topic and A Separation handles it very sensitively. It was also really interesting watching this film as a foreigner. I am a Westerner, but it was really intriguing watching a film set against an Islamic background. Although I don't think that A Separation was perfect. Its characters were largely unlikeable due to how they are all so dishonest. If only they told the truth, then they wouldn't have gotten themselves into such bad situations.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/Mv35HZ"
170,A Separation,9,2 June 2012,Great Masterwork,"It was a perfect drama movie.A Separation has great directing,acting,writing & editing. I advise you to watch this masterwork film.If you want watch this for First time don't forecast more because screenplay will Mislead you.""A Separation"" show us Divorce problem and its Influx on children even for a few days very well.""Asghar Farhadi"" create another masterwork (About Elly) please watch it and enjoy like me.I want to Thank A Separation's creators."
171,A Separation,5,4 November 2011,"Oh, what could have been.","Here's a film where I can easily understand why some found it an astonishing achievement, but for me there just wasn't anything that connected enough to make an impact. If you connect with these characters and get invested with them, I'm sure it could be a shattering work, but I didn't care much about anyone involved and therefore often found myself wondering when they were going to get to the ""good part"". The story presented some solid explorations into morality, pride, religion and the sacrifices people make for their children but I never felt it delved deep enough into any of them to leave much of an impression on me.The acting was universally quite good, with Peyman Moaddi and Sarina Farhadi being the standouts for me, but no one got a chance to amaze me to the degree I was hoping for. The characters essentially stay locked into their one expression for the entire film and don't ever budge from it. Naader is stoic, Simin is graceful, Razieh is beaten, Hodjat is erratic, et cetera. I kept wanting these characters to express something different, but writer/director Asghar Farhadi never gives them the opportunity to. I suppose that was my main complaint with the film, but there were a few other things that just didn't work for me.The film book-ends with this debate between Naader and Simin over where to move or not and what to do with their daughter as a result, but it almost immediately takes a backseat to the primary story, and stays that way until randomly becoming the focal point again at the end. It felt relatively tacked on and I wish they had delved more into it throughout the film, instead of lightly tapping back on it every half hour or so.That was the most interesting dynamic for me, but they spent the majority of the time on what I found to be a relatively uninteresting dispute over an act of aggression. The dispute between the two families feels very one-sided and Farhadi leverages the audience far too much into one direction, when it seems like he's trying to keep things in a gray area; he just completely fails to do. One side is wild and frustratingly emotional, while the other is reasoned and calm. For a while I thought this was the intention of the film, which could have been a smart move if the final act had gone in a different way, but with an eleventh hour semi-twist it kind of put that positive aspect in the can.I'll wrap up by saying again that the acting is well-worth watching, despite the characters not having much room to expand themselves, but overall this felt like a film with a lot of interesting areas that just weren't properly handled."
172,A Separation,6,26 March 2013,Ending disappointing. Is the DIRECTOR confused ?,"Well, I guess I have seen enough Iranian films by now to make some judgment on the present one.Acting v good by each BAZIGARAN. Direction could be better ; especially if an Iranian director is making film for an international audience he must keep in mind to show especially those things which are limited to Iranian customs and tradition and show them with more clarity for non- Iranians to understand and make a balanced judgment.Once again the ending is disappointing. Plus there are some lose ends in between where in I guess we being an international audience can't really make out sense of things which otherwise for a native Iranian would make sense. Anyway, that apart movie was indeed worth a one time watch. Did it deserve an Oscar is debatable. For that I need to see other films of that category. Or may be they gave it based only on the plot which is of course unique and matchless.To be honest, I was expecting this kind of ending where once again the DIRECTOR seems confused and is not sure what ending to show and hence leave it for the audience to decide the same and every individual viewer can have his own judgment on the same. Frankly it does not make sense to me.May be we Indians are use to a proper ending ; which may / may not make sense to all the audience but at least we know for sure what the Director has in mind. There after audiences can debate on the same and give their own opinion on what other ending were possible if any. But in case of Iranian films we don't know what ending the director has in mind so we are left in the dark and frankly don't know which way to go. On similar plot an Indian filmmaker would have produced a block buster.KHODA HAFEZ.SS"
173,A Separation,9,5 May 2013,Fantastic movie with brilliant angels.,"A Separation is an Iranian drama film about Nader and Simin who have been married for 14 years and together they have the eleven-year-old daughter Termeh. Simin wants to emigrate, as Nader did not want when he has his father who suffers from Alzheimer's in Iran. Simin applying for a divorce, but the application is rejected, and then she moved back to her parents. When Nader working on day and Simin moved so there is no one to take care of his father. Nader hires Razieh then, a young pregnant woman that should take care of his father on the day. One day Nader comes home to find his father unconscious on the floor with one arm tied to the bed, Razieh is not in sight of the house, she will be back later, but then Nader throw her out, he does not want to do with her. Razieh must go into the emergency room because she gets severe pain in the stomach, it turns out that she had a miscarriage and Nader is accused of the murder of the fetus but he denies knowing that he knew Razieh was pregnant.This movie is really well made ​​with fantastic actor. It feels a little different with a movie in Farsi and they take a while before you get used to it. This whole movie is filmed in absolutely fantastic angles, every scene is a work of art in itself, this will increase the score significantly! Almost every actor is impressive and there's actually not a bad actor. The film was a hit with critics and gained a lot of positive reviews, it has for example 95 MetaCore on 41 reviews, making it the film with the best ratings in 2011.Best actor according to me: Ali-Asghar Shahbazi for the role of Nader's father."
174,A Separation,9,12 March 2013,Relentless Series of Misfortunes Driven by Male Pride,"This is a gripping movie in which emotions run high and personal animosities generate one conflict after another in an ever-intensifying series of troubles. The result could have been dizzying and confusing, but ""A Separation"" is so well-written, and the characters so vividly portrayed, that the course of events is clear and the outcome inevitable.The source of much of the trouble in the story is male pride--pride of a kind that flourishes in a culture like Iran's, in which authority is inherently male and women have little choice but to accept it and give in to it. You can see it in the utter confidence of the husband Nader in his dealings with his wife Simin and with Razieh, the woman who comes to work for him. And you can see it in the demanding and irrational behavior of Razieh's husband Hojjat. Because Razieh fears Hojjat's angry reprisal--first for taking a job without his permission, then for losing their child in the course of doing that job--she sets in motion a series of legal battles that threaten to tear both families apart. In the end, as the film makes unmistakably clear, it is their two daughters who suffer.Yet even with this examination of the consequences of male pride, ""A Separation"" is not a political film or an argument for female liberation. It is a tragedy of people acting in the only way they know how, and in the process creating misery after misery."
175,A Separation,10,20 February 2013,Simply Riveting. An inspired masterpiece.,"At the time of this writing there are twenty-seven five-star reviews of this movie (twenty-eight including this one) and no zero-stars. There is little this reviewer can add to the reviews already on this website without repeating what has been said. This work is an inspired masterpiece. It hosts a well-written and constructed script; full dimensional characters which are not cardboard caricatures given to us by Hollywood; real-life situations that are totally believable and to which anyone can identify; the acting is; perfectly executed and convincing acting; and strong direction.This is an amazing film by any standard. The fact that it was made at all is a miracle. The Iranian government initially would not allow the film to be made, for political reasons. Deft diplomacy by the director allowed the green light for this film to be made.On a deeper level this film underscores that differences in politics or government or society in the present age are largely irrelevant. This is a couple everyone can identify with; the situations faced by this family could have happened in Europe, North America, or the Far East. This film tends to contradict a saying attributed to Leo Tolstoy, That happy people are happy for the same reason, but unhappy people have their own individual reasons for that unhappiness. Here, the cause of the family tension in Simin and Nadar's marriage could have existed in California, yet the locale of the movie is in Teheran. The anguish experienced by their daughter Termeh could be shared with any adolescent. Simin's and Nadar's use of Termeh as a bargaining chip to leverage control in their divorce is sadly not uncommon in dissolution matters. Add to this mix issues of integrity, pride, personal responsibility and honesty, and the final result is a compelling family drama.This movie is not meant for casual viewing. While a fine film in its own right, Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage is far too cerebral and rarified, even though the subject matter is completely different. In that movie you can fall asleep listening to Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson talk. Here, the story of Nadar and Simin will grab you and pull you in. Scene after compelling scene will force you to pay attention and watch the drama playing out before your eyes. This movie won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film for 2011. It should have been nominated and won the Oscar for Best Picture."
176,A Separation,8,22 September 2012,A slow-building feast of moral ambiguity and dramatic turns,"*Spoilers Contained Within*The first hour or so of this film had me a bit skeptical of the high praise lavished on this film- the plot seemed to trudge along with no real twists or surprises. Yet director Asghar Farhadi is no slouch and knows exactly why every scene plays out for the exact duration that it does, and the pay-offs come in the second hour.Still, this isn't just a typical suspense film where the trick lies in the ""reveal"" of the third act, as those reveals are only one piece of the puzzle. Indeed, my impression is that the moral ambiguity brimming under the surface as a result of the narrative twists and turns is the real substance of the film. No character is without his or her foibles- even the relatively innocent children make decisions that arguably make complicated matters even more labyrinthine. Because of this, the viewer can never truly be sure which character to side with and I suspect this is one reason why it was initially hard for me to become engrossed in the movie. That the filmmakers managed to create an engaging story in which each character makes complicated/morally tenuous decisions for completely understandable reasons is a major feat- I can think of only a handful of movies lacking a protagonist to ""root for,"" while still utterly engaging their audience, and even fewer still which do so successfully.There's a lot to digest after the film, though no big action scenes or Oscar-baity breakdowns. The issues raised may be indicative of the issues facing Iranian society, but can be generalized to reflect societal issues in any community globally. The acting is also top-notch and not overly showy and I feel it benefits from not featuring any recognizable actors (to an American audience, at any rate) in more fully immersing the viewer.This isn't a knockout film that wows and dazzles, but it is an intricately built work that deftly pulls viewers' allegiances from one character to another in an incredibly understated way."
177,A Separation,10,21 August 2012,Morally complex and impossible to emerge silent,"Asghar Farhadi's A Separation is my first experience with Iranian cinema and it for sure won't be my last. It reminds me instantly of a quote said by American director Alexander Payne, ""...I think there may be a problem with a world in which making small, human[...]films is 'an achievement.' It should be the norm."" Just from this film, I would be justified in saying that Farhadi is Iran's Payne.Here is a wonderfully made film that comes from a country that has been nothing but slandered for the last decade. We constantly hear horrible things are brewing in Iraq, such as suppression, inequality, unrest, and the increasing possibility of nuclear war, yet we see the tenderness and contemporary side of the country, where problems had by typical townfolk will mirror those of someone living in the United States. For a country so isolated and so different, it sure knows what notes to strike to hit home.The opening scene focuses on Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami), a couple who have been married for fourteen years and are now in court filing for divorce. The camera is positioned as if we are the judge, hearing both cases, with interruptions and simultaneous banter from each party. This gives us a great sense of angst, and the facial expressions on both characters are raw and authentic. They are divorcing because of grand contention when consulting their family's future, with Simin wanting to pack up and leave Iran in pursuit of a better life, wand Nader not wanting to leave his elderly father, who is tragically stricken with Alzheimer's.Another debate hovering over both of their heads is the future of their eleven year old daughter, Termeh (played magnificently by Sarina Farhadi). She chooses to live with her father, because by doing so, her mother will not leave Iran, and their family will still be somewhat close. No child, regardless of background or country, should ever need to make a decision like Termeh's.It dawns on Nader that because of work, he will need someone to watch his ailing father during the day. A woman named Razieh (Sareh Bayat) is hired as a caretaker for the man, who has limited his speaking to fragmented words and has now taken the life of a lion, laying in bed and sleeping for much of the day. One day, Nader and Termeh return home to an empty house to find the man lying on the floor unconscious, with one of his hands tied to the bedpost. Nader too discovers money missing from his home and when Razieh returns home, Nader erects an enormous argument which leads to harsh courtroom consequences after allegations raised by Razieh that she was physically assaulted.Razieh is pregnant and is married to the demanding, vindictive troublemaker Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), who only grows more and more demanding and agitated as time progresses. The two couples becomes unraveled by this tragedy, and the film begins to shed light on these character's decisions during this madness, following them on a relentless journey through the complications of marriage and impulsive decisions not meant to cause harm. I could label this Iran's version of Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing, a film where characters are faced with multiple decisions that need critical thinking in order to work out favorably, but I fear that would be an oversimplification.A Separation does not hesitate to dig deep into the separation of ethics, morality, religion, politics, and economics in present-day Iran. Writer/director Farhadi carefully examines the restraints both law and faith have within Iranians, whose lives are particularly foreign and difficult to comprehend for Americans, who are without a doubt living with restraints we do not usually recognize. It's admirable the film doesn't get stuck in stylistic clichés, empty-headed aesthetics, and a list of cripplingly undeveloped characters. We see these characters with space and clarity, watching them as they travel along this unforgiving road of confusion none of them should be facing.One actress that is likely to go unnoticed with four remarkable talents taking center stage is Sarina Farhadi's terrific portrayal of a youth caught in the middle of tireless madness. She is not made out to be the precocious tike who knows way too much, but is drawn more confused than her parents, who are caught in the middle of unfortunate circumstance. Much like the facial expressions of her parents, Farhadi's character Termeh holds those of innocence lost and fear of increasingly destructive trouble brewing. The hard part is knowing there is almost nothing she can do to stop it. She is forced to take a backseat while the ugly bleakness of the world drives around a labyrinth of confusion.Farhadi's Iran in A Separation is the kind of nuanced one that must be seen. It shows its characters as humans, and not trigger-happy terrorists. It shows their problems as common, and not in an unconventional way that is impossible for audiences of other countries to not relate to or be unable to grasp. The film is a difficult one to thoroughly contemplate alone, and perhaps it's one of those that is better debated with close friends or acquaintances. Its morally complex and involving scenarios are overwhelming to try and fathom quietly.Starring: Leila Hatami, Peyman Moaadi, Shahab Hosseini, Sareh Bayat, and Sarina Farhadi. Directed by: Asghar Farhadi."
178,A Separation,9,11 August 2012,"Oscar winning Iranian drama...,","A domestic drama set in contemporary Tehran. Yawn, no thank you. I love my World Cinema but usually too much politics and religion take over and gets too heavy, masking the story.However, this intelligently scripted (original, Oscar nominated script by director Asghar Farhadi, in the mainstream - that's 1 out 5 of ALL movies that year) soon grips and a personal story that is SO universal, then becomes shaped by Iran's religion and politics. This is done so superbly, you won't notice the join. Considering also that it's in Persian and even the end titles don't have any western writing, it's obviously not made with the U.S and Europe in mind.The story, surrounding the separation (as in the title) of Nadir and Simmin is complicated by Nadir's elderly father needing constant care due to his Alzheimers, making him vulnerable and a liability when he wanders. The couple have a young teenage daughter, who is intelligent, straight-forward and a good kid. The couple are both working, he in a bank.Most of the two hours deals with issues thrown up by these very ordinary, boring domestic situations but as in real life and to all who've been in such, there are big problems dealing with getting reliable care for the old man - and this is where the country's religion and economics come in.Issues on debt, debtors, birth, miscarriage, healthcare, theft, the legal system - even Tehran's traffic are all covered in a most natural and realistic way, leading to a complex scenario that culminates to a heart-rending and impossible situation. At times, it's straggly, as is the filming, which is for the better. Real life conversations aren't rehearsed and the camera looks around like the eye does - not shaky all the time like many modern films, nor smooth, but flitting to the subject being looked at and then holding that, making it all very realistic. The ending is also nicely straggly, too - you'll see what I mean - allowing the viewer to form their own opinion rather than it being neatly pigeon- holed.A Separation is not a film to see over and again; but watch it once and you'll learn more about real life Muslims in their own environment, with their own rules and how they deal with a big Life situation. That piece of drama is worth seeing for itself - that bit's universal as I said - as for the film, the only taint from the west are the added subtitles."
179,A Separation,8,7 April 2011,about vote film and vote,"its a film by asghar farhadi.he is e one best Iranian directors now and in this film we can see he's progress so clear.In he's two previous film's we think about a sin or mistake and after see the film we think about the others reaction's but in here we are in our life and we can feel all of the peoples who live in the story. we can feel ""Terme"" and farhadi could show his choice and we can enjoy of see that. but about the vote I see some of IMDb's user's are surprised and some of them are nervous ,i want to say to them Iran have a feeling people and today we have so political space about all of issues.This film is on of most political issues who this vote is a reaction about that who cant decrease the value of if it."
180,A Separation,4,14 March 2012,What's the point of this movie?,"I am a 54-year-old woman and I saw this movie with my 78-year-old father. Neither one of us could really see a point to this movie. First, we agreed that the couple showed no love for each other, so it didn't seem all that tragic that they were separated. I thought the point might be showing the Dominoe effect of how one thing leads to another until things get really out of hand. My father thought the point could either be showing the consequences of several people lying or the consequences of the father's stubbornness in not asking his wife to stay. Perhaps the point of the movie was simply to serve as a vehicle for making social commentaries.We were also very disappointed that there was no ending to the story. There was more than one unanswered question. In the end we never found out which parent the daughter chose to live with, nor, in fact, whether or not the couple would get back together. We also never found out what happened to the missing money. At one point the father said that it was the exact amount of the caretaker's salary. However, both my father and I thought the caretaker was sincere about not taking the money. Did the mother take it when we saw her counting money near the beginning of the movie? If so, why would it be the same amount as the caretaker's salary. Another unanswered question is why the caretaker's husband allowed her to keep returning to take care of the elderly father instead of doing it himself as it appeared he had agreed to do. Had he gotten another job at a motorcycle shop?"
181,A Separation,4,15 March 2012,Unbelievable Oscar,"Unbelievable! This film won the Oscar for best (foreign) film in a language other than English. Frankly, In Darkness and Mr Lazhar are far more deserving with better stories and far better acting. The Academy members were probably fascinated by this glimpse of daily life in today's Iran. In fact, it does fascinate but disturbs also. Seeing all these submissive women wearing the chador, even in their own home, is very disturbing. These women asking for spiritual guidance from Islamic law is revolting to anyone who cannot imagine a society where equality of the sexes is absent. The men on the other hand live a fully contemporary life without any shame. The story is weak but the elephant in the room has to be this heavy repression which is felt in the daily lives of these women. That is the true drama here. I was eager for it to end."
182,A Separation,8,16 April 2012,Frustratingly excellent,"2012 Academy award winner for best foreign language picture, Iranian social drama A SEPARATION follows the legal struggle between apparently wealthy, middle class Nader (Peyman Moadi) and housekeeper Razieh (Sareh Bayat), after a dispute leads to tragic consequences. Recently separated from wife Simin (Leila Hatami), juggling a career and responsibility to his 11 year old daughter, and caring for his alzheimer's stricken father, Nader is a man with a very full plate. Razieh is equally burdened by her pregnancy and the need to earn money following her husband's redundancy, while her incredibly devout religious beliefs only seem to make things more difficult. Ultimately when their two lives clash, such a frustrating situation is born that the film is at times exhausting to watch, yet always completely compelling.A SEPARATION is a glimpse into a world not often seen by foreign audiences, the day to day minutiae of life in relatively affluent Iranian society, where class and religious beliefs come into conflict in unexpected ways. There's something so absurd and darkly humorous about so many of the realities these people must endure, particularly in regards to religion, yet never does the film feel phony or forced. As each character gets drawn into the dilemma more and more and the blame game spirals out of control, so too does the narrative style constantly circle back on itself while never nearing any kind of resolution. A SEPARATION is maddening by design, representative of what seems to be an incredibly intricate and baffling bureaucratic system, compounded by archaic religious doctrine and difficult social politics. It's by no means an easy film, but for anyone willing to step outside their comfort zone, it's a rewarding experience, with much to take in and no doubt discuss afterwards.tinribs27.wordpress.com"
183,A Separation,7,20 September 2011,Excellence in grey,"There is only one thing that is extraordinary in this film: the ubiquitous prevalence of the colour grey, or of subdued colours like brown or green. The faces are greyish, the houses are grey inside and outside, the cars are grey, the hospital's waiting room is grey, the dresses and chadors are grey or at least black (!). All female persons, including the 5 years old daughter of the cleaning lady, wear a chador. It is only at the very end, while the camera depicts the scenery in the hospital, at least one young women appears in normal street gown.I don't believe that this colour reduction was the intention of the director or cameraman. This grey here is not really a symbol for the hopeless position of the protagonists, it is not like the blueish prevalence in Jean-Pierre Melville's ""Le samouraï"" with Alain Delon.This film is an intimate play, and not a bad one; however the absence of suspense at least half of the time creates some mild boredom in the spectator and the wish to see some setting in the nature - and not only the ones with battling and chopping adults.I remember another Iranian film, a much better on i.m.o., wherein a man goes to the hillside to commit suicide. There is currently some hype about NADER AND SIMIN, but I remain convinced that it will be forgotten in a few years."
184,A Separation,9,3 March 2014,An unconventional and brilliant mystery film.,"Asghar Farhadi's 2011 Academy Award-winning fifth feature film tells the multilayered tale of a family disintegration presenting contrasts and conflicts of gender, class and religion, combining classic Iranian domestic cinema and neorealism with a courtroom drama.'A Separation' enhances suspense and surprises the viewer with the use of its minimalist, documentary-style narrative and objective camera-work by only showing certain parts of the story. The visible and audible action of the plot only offers partial details of the complex whole, while a wide web of story information has to be inferred in order to fully understand cause and effect, story background and character motivation in the movie.The film begins with Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami), a married middle class couple filing for divorce. They share a flat in Tehran with their eleven-year-old daughter, Termeh, and Nader's father who suffers from Alzheimer's and needs to be taken care of. After hiring Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a pregnant woman for the job, a series of misfortunate events leads to Nader's accusation of being responsible for Razieh's miscarriage. He has to face court and also the woman's aggressive husband, Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini). Throughout several court scenes the mystery revolves around the fact that neither the characters of the story, nor the audience knows the exact details about what actually happened  the truth is only revealed in the end of the film.Farhadi chooses not to show the actual event that triggers most of the conflicts in the film. Razieh realises that Nader's ill father has left the building, and finds him trying to cross the busy road. After a cut, we see the family back in the apartment. The editing happens to be so inconspicuous that the leap does not draw exceptional attention to itself. We could think the missing portion held no significance but the story later reveals that Razieh has been hit by a car, resulting in the death of her unborn child. The narration stays objective at the end of the film as, under the pressure of lying under oath, she admits that Nader is not responsible for the death of her baby and tells about the accident. This ellipsis hides important details from us. Seemingly ordinary events get great significance later on.What happens on the stairs? We see Nader pushing Razieh but we do not see her actually falling. The camera, like Nader, stays in the apartment, a door away from the accident. Could Nader cause the miscarriage? This is one of the most important, recurring questions of the plot. We are not sure who is right and who is wrong. Just like the judge in the courtroom, we can only rely on the words of the characters. The movie is objective, does not take sides, only external behaviour is shown. We are free to sympathise with all of the characters.Farhadi is no stranger to this type of storytelling  in his 2009 movie 'About Elly' a teacher is invited to a weekend at the seaside by a family where she goes missing while looking after the kids who play in the water. Has she drowned or has she simply left without saying anything? The film shows the aftermath of the event, again, only offering the answer at the very end. Similarly, 'A Separation' presents an it-could-happen-to-you conflict and places essential story events outside of the plot. It is a perfect example (as well as Kiarostami's 'Taste of Cherry' or 'Close- up') of new Iranian cinema, where the tales of everyday people are presented in a mise-en-scène of realistic performances and original settings, through a cinematographic style that blends fiction film and documentary film features. In this case, a tale of mystery. As the director himself says in an interview:'A Separation is effectively a detective film [...], except that there is no sign of a detective. It is the spectator who plays that role. Based on a succession of clues, the spectator leads his own inquiry. [...] You could say that A Separation was a detective film told in the style of a documentary.'While the divorce of Nader and Simin frames the film (the bergmanesque opening shot in media res explains their situation), the separation is not in the centre of the plot, it rather becomes a secondary, underlying storyline. Behind the main conflict a wife becomes estranged from her husband after long years of marriage as misunderstandings, pride and unsaid words ruin their relationship and lead to their divorce. Their daughter, Termeh gets to choose which of her parents to live with  her decision is not shown. The last static shot of the two parents waiting in the hallway with the credits rolling leaves the audience frustrated without any answers, there is no catharsis  resembling Italian neo-realist classics such as Vittorio De Sica's 'Bicycle Thieves' where the protagonist is left in despair being unable to recover a stolen bicycle he cannot keep his job without.The film doesn't only talk about its characters but the country they live in as well. Simin wants to leave the country with her daughter in hope of a better living environment. Although she cannot convince her husband to support her decision, the actions of the plot seem to justify her reasons. The oppression of women, the tension between social classes, the pressure of Islamic laws serve as background circumstances but shape the plot at the same time, suggesting that the characters might be all victims of these circumstances. (This underlying message does not label 'A Separation' a propaganda film though, in contrast to Jafar Panahi's 2011 documentary 'This is not a Film' about Iranian government and censorship.) Farhadi's mirror to society is only implied, rather than using explicit references. From a country with such a strong political censorship, the country that blacklisted and imprisoned Panahi  this is a great accomplishment."
185,A Separation,10,29 July 2013,Perfectly directed,"A Separation won the 2012 Oscar for the best foreign language movie with reason. This movie is perfectly directed and the character are played with such accuracy. The movie cover many aspect of the Iranian society from the strong religion to the devotion women have toward their men. It also shows the reality of taking care of a father suffering from Alzheimer.As for the plot itself, it is really complex. It shows us the struggle of a father dealing with a divorce trying to do the best for his daughter while trying to resolve accusation that are brought upon him. The best part about this movie is the fact that, unless many other movies, each character are depicted with accuracy and honesty. It's really hard to choose a side cause none of the character are more likable than the others. Throughout the whole movie it's really hard to take position and that's why this movie is so good.10/10, one of my favourite ever !"
186,A Separation,10,31 July 2012,A True Masterpiece,"This year's Oscar winning film in the Best Foreign Language category is Asghar Farhadi's fifth feature, the absolutely thrilling 'A Separation'. The victory in February marked the first time a director has taken an Academy Award back to Iran.Set in modern day Tehran, Nader (Peyam Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are on the verge of divorce. Simin wants to leave Iran with her daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) after struggling for 18 months to get a visa. Nader wants to stay with his father, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Unable to compromise, Simin leaves her husband to live with her parents. Termeh, played by the director's daughter, decides to lead the battle her way. Staying with her dad, she hopes, will force her mother to remain in the country and return to the family home.Feeling solitude's pressure, Nader hires the pregnant, lower-class Razieh to take care of his ailing, demanding father. Razieh works against her husband's will and knowledge. In contrast to Simin, she's a religious woman desperate to support her unemployed spouse who is, if it couldn't get any worse, weakened by the threat of jail by his creditors.One day Nader returns home from work to find his father tied up to his bed, on the floor and about to die. Razieh (Sareh Bayat) is nowhere to be found. When she returns to her now furious employer, they engage in a struggle with unexpected and unfortunate consequences.'A Separation' is a simple yet layered drama, paced like a thriller. Each memorable scene is spectacularly acted and so naturally that audiences will feel like these characters could be their next door neighbors.It's a separation of a couple with different priorities; Simin's future is up against Nader's bitter reality. The only character trying to hold everything together is the torn-between-parents Termeh, an almost universal and familiar fate for crumbling families. It's a separation of classes; the educated elite vs. religious laborers. Both struggle to survive regardless of the moral or physical conditions that may threaten them. In between the troubled tales, Farhadi drops in events which provide a glimpse into what lies beneath society's cover.'A Separation' is like a literary masterpiece printed on film. It triggers different interpretations and is a genuine reflection on the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other. Questions abound over honesty, compromise, total innocence and guilt. It's also a portrait of a city, misinterpreted by many as purely fanatic and radical.This is 2012's best film so far, the kind that you probably won't be able to separate from, maybe forever.Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

187,A Separation,10,16 April 2012,Masterpiece in all expects,"Jodaeiye Nader az Simin  A Separation  CATCH IT (A+) A Separation is undoubtedly a masterpiece; there are no words to describe how brilliant this Iranian movie actually is. A Separation is as good as an emotional drama and as nail biting thriller. The story, screenplay and characterization are masterpiece in itself. There are very few movies which surprises you with their honesty and purity. A SEPARATION is a compelling drama about the dissolution of a marriage. Simin wants to leave Iran with her husband Nader and daughter Termeh. Simin sues for divorce when Nader refuses to leave behind his Alzheimer-suffering father. Her request having failed, Simin returns to her parents' home, but Termeh decides to stay with Nader. When Nader hires a young woman to assist with his father in his wife's absence, he hopes that his life will return to a normal state. However, when he discovers that the new maid has been lying to him, he realizes that there is more on the line than just his marriage. The complexity of the story and emotions in the movie is really hard to describe. The performances by Peyman Moadi and Leila Hatami are excellent and truly deserved all the accolades. The performances by supporting cast Sareh Bayat, Shahab Hosseini & Sarina Farhadi are excellent. The movie completely relies on its realistic approach to the situation and heart hitting performances by each and everyone. Overall, A Separation is highly recommended Oscar Winning Iranian movie, which will surly leaves you speechless. Brilliant, Brilliant and simply Brilliant."
188,A Separation,2,17 April 2011,It's only good when compared to other Iranian films.,"Last week, despite the fact that I normally despise Iranian movies, I went to see Asghar Farhadi's ""A Separation"". To make a long story short, the film was more or less disappointing. It's not that it was not good, but that it had nothing to offer internationally. I've seen movies by Fellini, Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Bergman, Korosawa, Tykwer, Kubrick, Lynch, Fincher, Burton, Allen and other genius minds in the universe of the seventh art; and this movie didn't even have the potential to be compared to their works. ""A Separation"" had a better script in comparison to ""About Elly"", though, to my idea, the ending was pretty immature and not as sophisticated as the rest of the film. Acting was OK, but cinematography, mis-en-scene, editing, and direction still needed massive improvement. Sound, music, use of colors and etc. have utterly been neglected by the director.Honestly, I believe the voting for this film is absolutely political and has been given blind, and in no way, this movie could be placed in the top 250 films of all time; if you take a look at that list, you see Fellini's ""8 1/2"" below this film. I mean anyone who's seen ""8 1/2"" knows that ""A Separation"" doesn't hold a candle to it at all. So I ask all of you patriotic Iranians not to mingle art and politics and take off your hallucination glasses and see this movie where it stands. I give it 5 out of 10 for the screenplay and the acting."
189,A Separation,1,14 March 2012,Wasted Oscar,"I started to watch that movie in a company of several friends. We all agreed that it was a waste of time after 30 minutes of watching. The movie is just boring, and I can't believe that the Academy gave that movie an award. 'Forrest Gump', a brilliant American movie, has a rating of 8.7, and 'A Separation' deserves 8.6? Also, in very rare cases I have seen a voting distribution of movie scores, where 57% of voters give a movie a score of 10, like in case of ""A Separation"". It is equal to distribution for the best movie of all times, the 'Shawshank Redemption"". This makes me think that something is wrong here. A 'Separation' is very far from being a masterpiece, so what's going on here?"
190,A Separation,10,15 March 2012,the Oscar-winner movie and its brilliant story,"everything and also all the success gained by this movie lies under its brilliant story,all the characters in the storyline are 'Gray', as we all know that a gray character has really hard-to-discover characteristics that doesn't let the viewer to label him as good nor bad easily, I can not help myself not speaking more about the story because that's the best and the most complicated story that I've ever seen,everybody's lying and the lies come true because of other people lies and no one is punished due to what he has done and in my opinion this complex has made it the most attractive and mind-involving story among all of the dramas that I've been faced with.this movie has won about 60 valuable awards worldwide and its success seems to be continues and yet this is not the end,--- I WANNA MAKE A BIG CHALLENGE HERE! IF ANYONE CAN MENTION A WEAK POINT ABOUT THIS MOVIE I WILL REMOVE MY NAME FROM IMDb AND WONT LEAVE ANY OTHER COMMENT HERE, SO IF U KNOW ONE, LET ME KNOW & LET'S TALK ABOUT IT, I'LL BE WAITING FOR UR REVIEWS,,, ---Best Regards,"
191,A Separation,10,12 January 2017,Truly engrossing and captivating family drama,"This is a movie called MASTERPIECE!!! It rightly won the 2012 Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film. It is easily one of the best emotional family drama since the turn of the millennium. A truly engrossing and captivating movie which portrays the helplessness of a son taking care of his old father suffering from Alzheimer's, his wife trying to provide their daughter a better future, the daughter trying to protect their parent's marriage and also the life of a poor family struggling to make ends meet. The beauty of this movie is that anyone can relate to it and connect with the characters and their emotions. The actors and I mean all of them are excellent to say the least. I assure you, watch this movie and you will think about it for days. Rest assured you will be swept off your feet. A beautifully directed film, work of an artist - Asghar Farahadi."
192,A Separation,5,14 November 2016,infuriating watch,"Simin wants to leave the country for the opportunity with only 40 days remaining. Her husband Nader refuses to leave his father suffering Alzheimer's disease. In desperation, she applies for a divorce although she prefers for them to leave together with their daughter Termeh. He is unwilling but reluctantly goes with her to a judge. The judge dismisses their application due to a lack of substantive problem. Nader hires religious Razieh to care for his father. There are marital and religious impediments to Razieh's job. Nader has a fight with Razieh over his father's treatment. He pushes the pregnant Razieh and she has a miscarriage.This is a film about angry characters in an infuriating system. It is interesting to see modern Iranian society. At first, I figured that this is a satire on the system. Then I thought that Razieh could be a comedic character. Nader is such an angry man and quite frankly so is everybody. I don't care about these people and I don't want to spend time in this society. Bad situations can be great cinema but this world is infuriating. It may work better to laugh at this world but this ends up stressing me out."
193,A Separation,9,10 February 2016,A Near Perfect Film,"I purposely went into this movie knowing only the highest award that it got (Academy Award for best foreign film of 2011). I decided just to see what would happen, and boy am I happy that I did. A Separation has a fantastically simple plot, yet it pulls it off beautifully. Similarly to the way I went into this movie, I will try to leave you as unsure as I was. I was so surprised by this movie. I didn't even know what the ratings were, and I was a little surprised at how incredibly well done the plot is (and everything else). The characters are great. They feel like relatively real people by the end, and its actually kind of crazy. I found myself torn between characters, not knowing who to root for. Everyone is flawed in an incredibly human way. There's no clearly right or wrong character. It's all up to what you think. The soundtrack for this movie is fantastic. Funny thing is, there isn't one, and for the tone of this movie that fits perfectly. Where does this movie falter? The pacing. While it does get really intense, the first little bit is pretty slow. It doesn't help that I wasn't entirely sure what was actually happening. It clears that up pretty quickly, but nevertheless it was there, and it was a problem. Overall A Separation is a fantastic movie. While it's not completely flawless, it sure is close. One other thing that separates it from perfection is the amount of movies that I'd rather watch. While it is still extremely enjoyable, it is also a two hour Iranian drama, so it's not exactly the most fun movie to watch (for an English- speaker like me at least). Nevertheless, it's extremely well done and I still enjoyed it immensely. The plot is fantastic and the characters are amazing, but unfortunately the pacing at the beginning could use some work. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie, so long as your a fan of drama, because this movie is full of it."
194,A Separation,9,20 November 2015,A thrilling introduction to Iranian Cinema,"Right from the first scene with the camera offering the spectators point of view, I was plunged into this drama. The actors performed superbly convincing us of the authenticity of the story but also keeping us engaged. Leila Hatami in her role had a certain aura in her stare which was captivating. Important themes of Iranian's are showed such as devotion to religion and family values with the strong affection the main character and even his daughter show for the grandfather to the point that the father is prepared to abandon 14years of relationship with his wife. Another remarking fact is that I could not force my self to take sides, for Nader or Razieh who lost her child, even though we get some truths such as Razieh's confession or Termeh's intuitive thinking. In this way I felt engaged asking myself who to trust or believe. Finally the mystery of the final scene is an astute technique by the director to give the decision to the spectator to whom they think should get the daughter. If watching in a group spectators can arise this question and even debate."
195,A Separation,10,2 October 2015,Jodaí-e Nadér az Simín,"A Separation is a domestic drama, but it is also a who-dun-it of sorts. A simple act of anger in pushing a pregnant woman out of the apartment becomes the trigger for a complex and multi-layered investigation into uncovering the truth. The judge must navigate this heated affair and dish out justice. They retrace their steps and return to scene of the crime, recreating the accusation of manslaughter like an Auguste Dupin or a Sherlock Holmes. Termeh, perhaps one of the only impartial observers of these events, conducts her own investigations, questioning her father until he buckles under those unblinking innocent eyes and admits to knowing that Razieh was pregnant. But he insists that this was not on his mind in the act, and we believe him, and that the law is unequipped to handle such emotional intricacies. So Termeh must lie, and in that silent, tear streaked face, we are told much more than a line of dialogue could ever do. The subtext shines through, as her impartiality is marred. The opening shot of A Separation is a two-shot long-take that places us within the judge, presiding over the less dramatic concern of Simin and Nader's divorce. I think this choice has a certain cinematic value to it that could have been replicated in that stuffy little courtroom later for the more important plot-line. The shot-reverse-shot cuts up the tension that is maintained by the character's excellent performances, fuses that burn bit by bit as they struggle to get their word in, their own version of the truth. The dialogue is furious, overlapping, full of hostility and authenticity that matches the body language. When Razieh is called upon to explain why she has left an elderly grandfather with Alzheimers alone and tied up, her entire body trembles with a nervousness and fright that plants a little seed of moral disbelief in our minds. Nader cleans a man who doesn't know who he is, and perhaps that fact is the straw that sees him collapse sobbing into his father's shoulder, puncturing the solemn silence. The sets are modest middle class, which has an even more sobering effect when we finally enter the low class family home of Razieh and Hodjat, the rusty wrinkling walls and crumpled couches a symbol of poverty that neither party is willing to consciously address. Kalari shoots with plenty of hand-held that is intimate, restless and unnerving, without being needlessly jerky. The settings play a living role within the film; closed doors signal privacy, a tense conversation, Termeh as the younger child always shut out or framed from behind a glass partition or window. In that final scene, we see two parents now the victims of this technique, so close and yet so far away. And then the shouts of another domestic drama echoes through the crowded corridor, that in itself a captivating story. There is no score here, the silence magnifying the scope of emotion. Orchestration does not drown out our characters; they do that to themselves in their arguments.It would be right in calling some of our characters petty, yet Farhadi takes these notions of pride and justice and honour and presents such a shifting and evolving case that never truly tells you what to think. Little details are unearthed slowly, forcing us to again and again realign our moral perspectives and evaluate these people based on new information. Hodjat spends more time in jail than out of it due to his debt, and is depressed due to his unemployment. Razieh is uncertain about the cause of her miscarriage, but fears to reveal the truth after her sin of seeking work without informing her husband. I am reminded of Kurosawa's Rashômon, which subverted expectations that flashbacks had to be objective and truthful. Many times I express frustration at character actions or emotional responses that seem logically flawed, irrational or just plain dumb. Even in the world of fiction, we seek explanation and coherency. I am frustrated because of the religious stranglehold of Razieh that has her terrified of touching an elderly man without first phoning a helpline, or when she lies to people's faces but cannot do so while swearing on the Quran. I am frustrated that Nader's ego and pride initially prevents him from admitting responsibility for his push, even at the expense of his family's safety and unity. But I fully and unequivocally understand why they make these decisions. A great film is able to push you to empathise with these flawed decisions, these prideful decisions, in our eyes even wrong decisions. This is a great film."
196,A Separation,,23 April 2015,Awesome cinema,"Don't go expecting lavish cinematography, this is shot on hand held cameras, or certainly on fairly shaky tripods throughout, often under the harsh glare of fluorescent lighting that throws a watery blue cast over the action at times. But that is highly appropriate because this movie has a creeping sense of voyeurism throughout as the intensely private happenings of a family, and perhaps country, in turmoil steadily build up into a furious climax.The plot is complex to say the least, but one can keep up by fully concentrating on each twist and turn of this micro-thriller.The oppression of the Koran in this staunchly Muslim country carries a heavy burden throughout the film and it's the most frequently used prop as one of the characters in particular, the victim of a central crime, seeks spiritual guidance throughout. It's importance and oppression is palpable.The story concerns the vain attempts of a wife (superbly acted by Leila Hatami) to leave Tehran with her husband to improve the life of their 12 year old daughter. But the husband cannot force himself to leave his Alzheimer's afflicted father behind and so stalemate ensues and divorce becomes the only alternative, this results in a separation and so the father (played to perfection by Peyman Moaadi) is forced to hire a nurse to look after his desperately sad father during the day.One thing leads to another and inadvertently the husband pushes the nurse so that she ends up aborting her child.This sets off a horrendous chain of events that I will not reveal here for fear of spoiling it for you.Suffice to say the tension mounts throughout the movie and culminates in a heartbreaking decision for the couple's 12 year old daughter that is resolved in a way that Michael Hanneke would applaud vigorously.This movie deals with important themes of family loyalty (more than love), duty, the oppression and folly of religion and pride.Without overbearing pride much of the consequences of this film would not happen. Time and again you silently shout at the screen ""just do the right thing and this mess will be resolved."" They never do."
197,A Separation,8,9 April 2015,"Gorgeous masterpiece that came straight from Iran, but with a universal message.","Most of Iran movies are not recognized as they should, and is a pleasure to know that this film had the recognition it deserved, being the first Iranian film to win an Oscar for Best Foreign Movie, and winning more 16 awards. Nader and Simin are a normal couple, but Simin desperately wants to leave the country with her only daughter, Termeh, so her daughter will have better opportunities in her life, but Nader, the father and husband, can't leave the country because of his sick father who suffers from Alzheimers, and he do not want to give permission to his daughter leave the country with his mother, so Simin then opts for a separation, which then would cause major problems for both. The performances in this movies are great, everyone in the cast do a great job. The directing and the script are excellent, gradually revealing the truths, causing a tension throughout the movie, this movie is one of the best example of how to tell a story . The cinematography is also excellent and quite realistic. The movie also has an excellent study of character and human, and how religion can be above the moral of certain characters, the film also talks about the oppression of women in religion, and how pride can end up being more important than a person, the movies has very important messages that transcends not only in Iran, but around the world. ""A Separation"" is an unique and excellent directed masterpiece, has transcendent messages that reflects on our society in general, and is one of the new classics of the twenty-first century."
198,A Separation,,23 March 2013,"The praise hurts it but the character-driven story is engaging, natural and convincing","I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I had heard it was about a divorce at the end of a relationship and I had therefore assumed it would be an exploration of the emotional aspects of that. I had also heard every critic saying it was a triumph and seen it awarded the Oscar too, so there was a part of me that expected greatness just to happen, even though I did try to come to the film with my own open mind. The plot does start with a separation as the title suggests but it uses this as the base to tell a story leading up to and after an event and it is mostly around this that the film orientates itself.The telling of this story and the investigation into the event is very tightly focused and it isn't really driven by revelations or plot twists, although in a way it does have these. The main driver for the film is how information and situations change character's perceptions of other and also the viewer's perception of them and their actions and motivations. This is what kept me engaged because it wasn't just a matter of ""someone did something"" but that this new information cast a light onto a character that made everyone think slightly differently. It sounds simple but it works very well because it means it is constantly subtly changing and shifting as you watch. The actual event itself does have certainly cultural aspects which may mean it will not make total sense to people such as myself who are not familiar with the culture, so there will be cases where the viewer finds themselves with thoughts such as ""why doesn't he/she just etc""; there is a certain need to go with these and in the cases I had, there are cultural things that the film doesn't explain (and nor should it really).With such a focus on characters and their motivations and actions, it is important that the performances are good and by and large they are. Everyone convinces in their characters and, despite cultural differences, makes things recognizable as being associated with people generally  not Iranians specifically. Maadi is probably the best here as he makes his actions and feelings very clear and even as perception of him changes, his character technically doesn't  he is the same person. Although Hatami has the posters, I think that Bayat did the better job as her character is more complex and more engaging  although Hatami is still very good and tells us a lot about her character with very small touches. Hosseini is also very good and his character is difficult but engages because he makes sense, he seems real  you may not like him as a person, but you can understand why he is the way he is without it being overly explained. The two children (Farhadi and the little girl) were also very good  very natural and convincing. Direction of the performances is strong but the film still has plenty of very well framed shots and it looks crisp and clean throughout.Overall this film probably has been a bit too over-hyped for its own good because it isn't the second coming or a film that will blow you away and as such some expecting this may be disappointed. However it is a strong engaging story that works because of how well written and performed the characters are and how the drama keeps the perception of them and their actions changing and moving. It is very well made and it impressed me by how such a small domestic drama could hold me like it was a much bigger thriller of sorts."
199,A Separation,9,12 January 2018,Piece of art...!,"Farhadi told us the whole story through the mouth of husband and wife, he let us to hear them talking. sometimes in the movie he even let us to judge them, and at the end he told the story through the mouth of their 18 year old child. He did it so perfect that only Farhadi could end such a story, like that. Ending in Farhadi's movies is so important, even more important than the whole movie. At the end he put into the story his own view. Because every character has his own story, and the beautiful art is you let him talking himself."
200,A Separation,10,6 December 2017,"Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking together in the same direction.","The ability to see events from different perspectives is one of the most important elements of a successful relationship, whether it involves a married couple, a parent and child, or a group of nations. Warring parties are always convinced that they have right or, in some cases, God on their side. To them, every action they take is fully justified and every act the other party takes is sinister. The failure to see other people's perspectives is in full view in Asqhar Farhadi's brilliant A Separation, winner of the Best Foreign Film award at the Golden Globes and nominated for an Oscar in the same category. Farhadi does not ask us to choose sides but to observe how decisions made with good intentions and for the alleged benefit of others often have the opposite effect. The film opens in a courtroom in Tehran as Simin (Leila Hatami) speaks to a judge, unseen by the camera, asking him to grant her a divorce from Nader (Peyman Moaadi) her husband of fourteen years. Simin wants to leave the country and take her 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), with her to seek better opportunities abroad. Nader, a bank employee, however, will not leave Iran because of his responsibility to care for his elderly father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) coping with Alzheimer's disease. Even though they have been married for fourteen years, there does not seem to be any hint of compromise. Unable to obtain the divorce because the judge deems the issues not ""serious"" enough, the couple agrees to separate with Simin going to her mother's house and Termeh staying with her father. To help care for his aging father, the well-off Nader hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a pregnant, less affluent young woman with a four- year-old daughter. Whether or not Nader knows she is pregnant will become a contentious issue later in the film. Razieh, a devout Muslim, who has not told her husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) about her employment, is conflicted when she has to change the clothes of the incontinent old man, and feels compelled to ask an Islamic authority if it would be considered a sin. Things become even worse when Nader returns from work and finds his father lying on the floor barely breathing with Razieh nowhere in sight. When Razieh returns home after she claimed she had to do an important errand, an angry Nader accuses her of stealing money and asks her to leave immediately. Resistant to leave, he pushes her out the front door, causing the pregnant woman to fall down the stairs. Events begin to spin out of control when Razieh has a miscarriage and her irate husband takes Nader to court for murder. As the case is presented in a preliminary hearing before a judge, the divide between the families escalates and each person is guilty of concealing the truth in order to protect themselves or a family member. A Separation may sound like a melodramatic soap opera, but it is far from it. It is a powerful, realistic, and beautifully acted drama full of constant tension and uncertainty, a film in which each person must confront the fact that the walls they have erected have not led to nurturing relationships. While the film is not overtly political, an underlying sub-text is the depiction of a male-dominated autocratic theocracy, a political system based on force, oppression and the alienation between gender and class. Eager to enhance their daughter's education, the couple hired Miss Ghahraii, a teacher (Merila Zare'i) from her school to come to their flat to provide coaching for her upcoming exams, but it is painfully clear to see how much more she is respected than Razieh, who stays in the kitchen during family gatherings. As the adults fight over perceived injustices, the children, as is often the case, endure the most pain, conflicted by their love and dependence on their parents and their desire for morality and justice. While Termeh seemingly hides her pain, her face reflects the terrible burden her parents have put on her by their inability to see the world from other points of view, the kind of tragedy that has plagued mankind for centuries. As Farhadi has wisely said ""What I hope is that the viewer will not know whose victory to wish for."" When responsibility, love, and sacrifice are not present, there can be no victory for anyone. Howard Schumann"
201,A Separation,8,24 November 2017,"""What is wrong is wrong, no matter who said it or where it's written.""","I would be hard pressed to come up with another movie that keeps the viewer so conflicted and anxious about the characters over the course of it's run time. There's literally no down time to catch a breather here because virtually every scene involves the principal players bickering with each other, over matters that are not trivial. I was particularly intrigued by the daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi, daughter of director Asghar Faradi), caught between two parents who can't come to terms over mother Simin's (Leila Hatami) desire to leave Iran for a better life, and father Nader (Peyman Noadi), who harbors a strong sense of duty to remain and care for his own, Alzheimer's afflicted father.Following the incident with housekeeper Razieh (Sareh Bayat), Termeh acts as her father's conscience, constantly prodding him with questions about what happened and his culpability in Razieh's miscarriage. Though her best advice is for Nader to tell the truth in court, it was with great insecurity that she appeared before the judge to answer questions about what she knew or had observed or overheard among the various parties involved. She answered honestly about knowledge of a doctor's phone number shared between her tutor and Razieh, but for all that, she was able to evade the question of whether her father knew about Razieh's pregnancy, because the judge never asked her about it. That knowledge about the pregnancy was crucial to the judge's understanding of what happened and how he would deal with the case. So in effect, Termeh did not follow her own advice and was severely conflicted over her decision.As good and as tightly scripted this story was about the conflicts between the parties, the primary thing that bothered me about it was how the plaintiff's side (Razieh and husband Hojjat), consistently talked to the defendant's side (Nader and Simin) throughout the story. Sometimes the conversation was cordial, at other times confrontational. That did not resemble the American system of justice that I'm familiar with, and I can only assume that strictures among opposing parties are different in some way in Iran. Perhaps because each side was operating without an attorney before the judge had something to do with it. Still, it was odd to see how the parties came together to put together a monetary settlement, even if Nader was not going to go along with it.The picture concludes with as much ambiguity as everything leading up to it, and the viewer is challenged to come up with their own interpretation of who Termeh will agree to live with following this ordeal. There are compelling reasons why she would pick one parent over the other that work for either choice, so the question remains, what would you do? I have my idea, but you'll have to watch the film to come up with your own."
202,A Separation,1,19 January 2012,Overrated and misogynistic,"I have no idea how this film has been rated ""the best of the year"". Maybe in the middle east. It doesn't even come close to that category.The directing in itself is pretty second rate and amateurish. But then comes the plot... It follows a common thread I have seen before in Iranian films where stories are often focused on the imaginary ethics of the human character. Self glorification of the male character, that is. But rarely of the women.Nader and his wife Simin are a married couple who argue about living abroad. Simin prefers to live abroad to provide better opportunities for their only daughter. However, Nader refuses to go because he thinks he must stay in Iran and take care of his father, who suffers from Alzheimers. Simin is determined to get a divorce and leave the country. Not only is she willing to leave the country, but she is even willing to leave her own daughter behind. None of this makes any sense in the actual story.I saw this film with friends. What struck us is how misogynist it is. Every problem that Nader experiences is, of course, solely the fault of his wife Simin. He is always the good one, innocent and pure. He cooks, cleans, works, takes care of his daughter like a modern day single dad and looks after his father and is the one who is the gentle and demure one while his wife basically does nothing except put demands and create problems. He is basically the wife but with a beard. Wow! Where in the world do we find such amazing men? In the middle east? I think not.And if its not his wife, the next bad person who creates even more problems is, surprise surprise, one more woman: the troublesome cleaning lady. She lies and creates devastating legal problems for her own and Simin's family while both the husbands are honest, sacrificing and basically saints.Does no one see how utterly ridiculous and laughable the story truly is? It's middle eastern science fiction to the extreme. The plot makes no sense. How many women would abandon a man who is basically a saint? In this movie, the wife not only wants to abandon her husband but her own child. And there is no clear message as to why she want to do so. Her explanation of wanting to live abroad feels lame and staged. What the film actually shows is how female-hostile the director's own country is although I don't think it was intended that way. Had the film not been so exaggerated on the saintliness of the husband, and had a more valid reason for his wife's constant refusal to cooperate, it may have felt more believable. The film does, however, reveal a bit of the complexities of Iranian society.If this movie gets an Oscar, the Academy should be ashamed of themselves."
203,A Separation,7,20 February 2013,Enjoyable but over-rated film,"The rating that this film has on IMDb gives one a false sense of what is good in this particular picture.There is lots to like, with an excellent script executed with a high level of skill by all of the major players. The acting of the two male lead roles is particularly excellent, with some moments of genuinely convincing and sudden violence.Likewise the cinematography is excellent with impressive shooting taking place in all parts of the film, and you really do become immersed in the conflict, thanks to a flowing and coherent narrative and an engaging story.So why do I not agree with the average 8.5 current rating on IMDb? Well, despite the film dealing with its subject matter with flair, the story itself falls a little bit flat in that ultimately its just a story about a domestic conflict that, for want of a better term, grows arms and legs and becomes bigger than the sum of its parts. Its just a story about an accident where the parties disagree and therefore it never takes off in any meaningful sense but rather ambles along in a plodding fashion until the film ends, suddenly, without anything having really been resolved.Some might argue this is representative of the complexity of the issues involved and I wouldn't disagree with that, but as a viewer this is a little unsatisfying and although I enjoyed it, this film does not warrant the place among the 'greats' that its current rating affords it. I would recommend it to anyone and it will provide ample food for thought, but then so does an episode of Big Brother if you're determined to think about why people do what they do in complex social situations involving different people with different opinions.You won't regret watching this film, but I'd be surprised if you are blown away as well."
204,A Separation,1,17 January 2012,a relatively decent one  among Iranian movies,"I consider this film as an Iranian who personally does not relate to the specific problems it addresses, so there is no emotional point for me. I also don't take part in the political voting against the pro-regime film ""Ekhrajiha 3"" by rating this one 10.If I had seen nothing to compare with, I could give an arbitrary rating incl. 10 to this one, but comparing ""Marmoulak"", ""Gavaznha"", ""Gav"", and other Iranian dramas with this one, I must say it is not the best of Iranian cinema but a decent one. In the international comparison it would fall a bit farther behind, and that's fully natural.About the content, without intention of spoiling, the film gives you quite a good insight about some very actual problems of Iranian society and has a subtle political point, and certainly it is worth watching from educational point of view. Watch it to see how totally different interests, circumstances, restrictions, hopes, and emotions clash in a society that is longing for freedom as a human right. But don't draw conclusions about Iranian cinema in general due to the fact that some of my fellow Iranians call this one the best movie ever!"
205,A Separation,1,13 February 2012,sorry but this is ...ABSOLUTE RUBBISH....,"I could nor believe myself watching this movie, and i don't understand the rating , I mean 8.8 , come on people, what happened to the great international movies, if you have seen ""flower of war"" which is also nominated, you will know what I am talking about, no comparison whatsoever, we have seen masterpieces, the best example I can give is "" the lives of others"" and many more, but this, is a waste of time, no plot, so storyline, very poorly directed , and least of all, so boring, I kept on watching just to see or maybe expect a twist or something but nothing good came out of this movie and i ended up wasting 2 hours of my life for this, a complete waste of time. It does not measure up to the list of movies competing with , which makes rethink of the whole golden globes, Oscars, too bad we do not have a taste anymore in movies.. sorry to say but considering myself as a great movie critic, i was very disappointed.."
206,A Separation,8,25 February 2012,I am feeling SEPARATED!,"And I ran, I ran so far away, I just ran, I ran all night & day, I couldn't get away Sorry to get all ""Flock of Seagulls"" on you in the beginning of my film review of the Iranian foreign film ""A Separation"", but I had to since there will be a flock of puns in this review as there normally are in all my movie reviews. ""A Separation"" has received mucho critical acclaim and even received Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominations. I thought the movie was very well-crafted by Writer-Director Asghar Farhadi and was very deserving of its Best Foreign Language Oscar nomination, but I would not separate ""A Separation"" as one of the best screenplays of the year; so yea, I do not think it was worthy of its Best Original Screenplay nomination. Hey ""A Separation"" lovers- before you separate from my review, please let me explain why. Before I do that, I have to do the ""explain the movie plot thing"" in my review. ""A Separation"" is primarily about Nader and Simin, an Iranian couple on the verge of a separation (ya, that is the title of the movie) because Simin says that she wants to flee from Iran to a better land, and Nader does not want to join his cousin Ralph Nader in America and therefore wants to stay put in Iran to take care of his ailing father. Due to the separation, Nader hires the deeply-religious Razieh to take care of his father. An argument between Nader and Razier on the caring of the father turns ""A Separation"" into a tailspin of turmoil for the characters involved. Director Asghar Farhadi directs this downward spiral with cerebral supremacy an authenticity; I did enjoy Farhadi's direction far more than his screenplay, which was solid but not of Oscar nomination material due to its basic verbal exchange between the film's characters. Peyman Maadi and Leila Hatami excelled with their starring performances as Nader and Simin. And teen actress Sarina Farhadi was astounding as their teenage daughter Termeh, who does not want to be the Termehnator of her parent's marriage. I am going to give you the good fortune of a separation from my puns as I end this review, but please do not separate yourself from ""A Separation"" viewing. **** Good"
207,A Separation,3,22 December 2011,Boring movie,"I read some highly regarded reviews and saw the 8.6 before watching this. Now that I have seen it, its really really boring. I can see why Iranians would like it as there probably is not a lot of quality films made there but man it was boring. By the end I didn't even care what happened. I would have shut it off, but I kept thinking with a 8.6 it HAS to get better. It may be good in Iran, but in the US its really bad. I love a lot of foreign movies from City of god, to I saw the devil. But I wish I had my 2 hours back now. Th characters didn't give me any feeling or emotion AND I have an 11 year old daughter like the main characters. I was glad when it ended and surprised and the 8.6. Very disappointing."
208,A Separation,1,31 January 2012,reality,"This has very weak technical setting in comparison of its rivals . Also the story is completely repetitive with no any new tactic attraction . For sake of governments limits it couldn't show an open space of vantage . from other side every body knows this year Has coincided with 33th anniversary of Islamic republic of Iran , the last year !!! and if this movie took the golden globe award - and possibly it will take the Oscar - this is related to political trends of time , not any thing else. Generally Iran always wonder world by its stuff presentations whether be cinematic titles or might be from newses ! First i should confess i respect purely to all art world specially to the cinema . but we know there are some words among our definitions which always must be with unit culture . and in this case about cinema we are just one suitable word , global being culture . how can Iran's government make and send a title to screen while they don't believe screens creed . this just shows an extreme destruction , not any more . not an art is competent for awards . which origin is showed up that shows peaceful being of all Iranian people that asghar farhady claims? this is just a joke . i live here i am always sorry for that . many of this people are asleep and will no longer wake up ! a cultural product is not always same belief shows. it can appears for making a fraud . this film mustn't be a symbol of USA and IR engagements . you can be a mysterious grudge beneath all scenes of it .♂zero zero♂"
209,A Separation,9,26 September 2014,Painfully realistic,"After one day of watching this movie, its characters and plot are still with me somehow. I haven't been able of getting rid of them, I still think about this movie at randome times of the day. It is such a good movie, the acting is so good and the characters so real! The plot, above all, is breathtaking. It just get getting more complicated, and you never know whose side to be with, and somehow you feel pity for every single one of its character! This is a very sad movie; but realistically sad. It's not sad in the way movies like Life is Beautiful or 12 Years a Slave are sad; the pain that the characters of those movies go through is somewhat spectacular. But the pain of this movie's characters is much more easy to relate with; is as painful as life itself. Because the problems they face are not Hollywood-esque; they are real-life problems. I guess that, being myself a child of divorced parents, I could really relate to the problems involved in the characters' separation.Another thing that stood out; though I'm not sure if it was the director's intention or the mere consequence of being watched from a Western perspective, is the theme of religion. Though not the main topic of the movie, it is always there. It affects' the character's behavior tremendously, but I guess that's just the way it happens in real life. The theme of social inequity is also present, with the family that sues the main character being considerable poorer, which makes their behaviour much more justifiable.This is one of the best non-American movies I've ever watched, and it rightfully deserved its Oscar. Highly recommendable!"
210,A Separation,10,18 May 2014,Beyond the borders of art.,"First of all , i am Iranian and i have to admit that Farhadi made a perfect picture of current iranian society.It is a great achievement for any film to present a fine and honest view of a society.Asghar Farhadi(the director)is one of the best iranian film makers , perhaps the best in his race and this film is his masterpiece.the story is solid and perfect , acting is good and directing is magnificent.there is no sign of stupid reactions and meaningless behaviors.Farhadi made his story very dynamic and audience never get tired because there is always progress in every single scene.FOR THE END:MAKE SURE YOU Don't MISS IT."
211,A Separation,10,25 April 2014,Simply Fantastic,"Wow, oh ho. That's how it's done, boys. Simply breath taking. Is easily one of the best films I've seen in the last 6 months or so.There are many layers in it, is indeed a complex story. But is all told with cleverness. Also, the twists were very awesome. And what is more interesting, perhaps, is the fact that most of the film is left to the viewer's interpretation(since we don't have the facts per see), so therefore you have to ask yourself ""who is wrong"" and ""what really happened?"" All in vain, since in the reality what will count is in what you believe and what are your beliefs.I regret the fact I didn't watch this film earlier. Is certainly the best film of 2011, and now one of my favorites.An easy 9.8/10."
212,A Separation,9,29 September 2013,A must-watch,"Little sins that change a life. Who wants to have all the reason will suffer and cause suffering. A fantastic movie with immaculate direction and sublime acting, the tics of elderly well caught (the trembling hands, etc..) and the curiosity and innocence of children, but with attention to every detail equally amazing. Using arguing as an art and as a subject which few filmmakers successfully did and after all, this is a film where tension comes from personality conflict, dialog and body language, not action. And it is not worth it asking how is the end. The answer is irrelevant. The tragedy happened long before you reach the end and there is no happy solution."
213,A Separation,10,17 July 2013,A Masterpiece,"What I love about this movie is the fact we all have genres that we are not a big fan of , some of us like the movie to be as complex and as dark as it gets and some of us want the movie to be plain and simple however as I left the theatre and talked to the people who saw the movie with me I was baffled to find out that it didn't matter if you are a movie buff or rarely watch movies . A Separation has this magnet-like quality to it,that makes you so connected to all the characters as they all are standing up for something that you could sympathies with . Nothing is black and white as there is no such a thing as pure evil or pure good and this masterpiece directed and written by Asghar Farhadi couldn't have shown and proved this point more elegantly. In words of the late Roger Ebert A Separation "" will become one of those enduring masterpieces watched decades from now."""
214,A Separation,9,26 June 2013,"Incredibly depressing, yet I didn't hate it. It was brilliant movie-making.","A Separation is about a couple in Iran struggling with their marriage. The wife leaves the husband temporarily in the hopes of eventually leaving Iran with their daughter. In the midst of this trouble the husband is accused of assaulting the woman he had hired to look after his elderly father (with Alzheimer's). There is a lot of arguing and crying. There is a lot of helplessness. Basically this movie is just one upsetting situation after another.Normally, I'm not a fan of movies where nothing good/happy happens. I'm a sucker for happy endings when it really comes down to it. This movie was incredibly depressing, yet I didn't hate it. I guess it was because it was just so well done. The acting was some of the best I've ever seen. The way the movie was shot was brilliant. It was intimate and really honest, no fluff. There was no music to amplify or suggest a mood for the scenes; you had just the actors to feed off of. That was enough. Wonderful movie-making.I was not surprised that this movie was nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Best Foreign Film and one for Best Original Screenplay. It was excellent. Upsetting and excellent. Would I recommend this movie? Well... I guess it depends on what kind of movie-watcher you are. If you're an Oscar junkie/movie buff, YES YES YES! It was so worth seeing. If you watch movies to escape from reality into feel-good land, don't see this film. You will NOT feel good at all."
215,A Separation,9,16 May 2013,Breathtaking movie but hard to watch!,"The movie was suggested to me by a friend and I am glad I took the advice. It is a magnificent movie in portraying real emotions and real people,something that resonates throughout the world. Although made in Iran, the movie could be set almost anywhere and will still have the same impact.The characters are real;not just black or white but always a touch of grey and brilliant at that.It is hard to watch at times as it is a honest portrayal and leaves a lasting impression.So many movies one hardly remembers once you step out of the theatre except for one or two scenes.It also raises the issue of why movies from other countries with similar non-Hollywood budgets aren't focused on story and characters.Admittedly French and Korean movies are exceptions to this rule.This movie is a must see and hopes it makes the list of everyone's list."
216,A Separation,10,30 April 2013,to be or not to be,"A very thought provoking film. It asks the audience to be in the young daughter's shoes who was charged with the question which demanded a King Solomon's wisdom. And the audience went back over the film frame by frame and each according to his or her religious belief, cultural background, philosophical persuasion and social class would come to a different conclusion. Who is right and who is wrong? Or is there a winner no matter what is the decision? The film starts with a choice- personal fulfillment or filial duty overlaid with matrimonial complications. People from the west would vote for individual freedom and aspirations-maybe and folks from the east would frown upon a dereliction of filial obligations-maybe. Then the film introduced a compromise by a religious woman to earn income for her family. Again certain religious people would forbid such an arrangement- woman taking care of a man no matter how elderly or infirm and lay people would approve of her diligence. Then the film brought in a civil matter. Was he guilty and deserving the harsh sentence imposed by the law of the land and if not was the victim not deserving to be compensated? Did the parties involved not stretch the truth or hide the truth? Folks with European background might prefer the truth and nothing but the absolute truth and likewise folks with less stringent legal culture might prefer a folksy conclusion. Then there is the social class angle. Does the victim from poor background have the right to resort to violence or the well-off can hide behind legal wrangling? Then there is the middle ground but religion would complicate it and civil laws would not recognize it. And the teenage daughter with all the innocence of a newborn and the conscience of a common man would be required to make a choice and she is us the audience. The film did give us a hint. A man might win the war but lose the world and that might be the universal truth east, west or middle east. A must see film."
217,A Separation,8,23 September 2012,"naturalistic style, universal story","Going strictly by its press releases, one might conclude that the Oscar-winning ""A Separation"" is mainly about the difficulties Iranian couples face in procuring a divorce. But that turns out to be a fairly small part of the movie, actually. In fact, on a political level, the film is more of an indictment of a legal system wherein a person who inadvertently causes a woman to have a miscarriage can be charged with the murder of that child.But politics and social reform take a back seat in the movie to its human drama, as writer/director Asghar Farhadi provides us with a naturalistic tale of ordinary, decent people trying - but often failing - to lead ordinary, decent lives in a world too often ruled by the cruel exigencies of random chance.Simin (Leila Hatami) is seeking a divorce from her husband, Nader (Peyman Moaddi). It's not that she really wants a divorce; it's that she wants the two of them to move out of the country with their 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Fahadi), to seek a more promising future for themselves somewhere else, but Nader wants to stay in the country to take care of his father who is suffering from Alzheimer's. However, the judge deems that there are not sufficient grounds in this case to grant a divorce. When Simin moves back in with her parents, Nader is forced to hire a woman (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father during the day while he's at work. It is at that point that the real trouble begins.I don't want to give much more of the plot away than that; suffice it to say, the movie is a realistic drama made up of characters who are neither heroes nor villains, sinners nor saints. There's plenty of blame to go around for what happens in the story - and at times it feels a bit like an episode of Adults Behaving Badly - but Farhadi always make us aware of just how flawed but well-intentioned these wholly recognizable figures are. Their customs and religious beliefs may seem a bit foreign to Western eyes, but the issues of marital discord, of caring for an elderly parent, of trying but often failing at being a role model for one's children, and of refusing to accept the consequences of one's actions are universal in their scope and nature.There's a certain redundancy in the narrative and an occasional flatness in the storytelling, but excellent performances and a bravely inconclusive, lady-or-the-tiger fadeout hold us in the movie's thrall."
218,A Separation,8,22 July 2012,An enthralling drama...,"Very well made with the look and feel of, what we Brits call, a 'Kitchen Sink Drama'. Lots of very naturalistic dialogue showing people how they actually are. Great performances all round, particularly from Peyman Moadi as Nader, Leila Hatami as Simin, Sareh Bayat as Razieh and Shahab Hosseini as Hojjat. I should also give a special mention for the young Sarina Farhadi, who played the daughter Termeh with great feeling.Although it was very good I did have a couple of problems with it. First of all it was very heavy on dialogue which made keeping up with the subtitles a little tricky. More than once I had to go back so I could properly understand a passage. Secondly, I did find it a little too long, it has quite a slow pace but I felt certain things could have been moved along slightly quicker. By the end I was looking at my watch never a good sign. Having said that I did find it quite compelling with an interesting insight into the legal system of a country we know little about here in the West. Over all, despite these few shortcomings, still a worthy watch with some excellent performances RECOMMENDED.My Score 8.3/10IMDb Score: 8.6/10 (based on 56,371 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 95/100: (Based on 41 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 99/100 (based on 141 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 93/100 'Liked It' (based on 14,327 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
219,A Separation,,4 April 2012,Such a pleasant change,"No special effects, no stunts, no car chases - and the whole thing in Farsi. How could it possibly appeal to an English-speaking audience? But ""A Separation"" deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.Asghar Farhadi has both written and directed a compelling domestic drama set in a middle-class home in Tehran. At the centre of all the trouble is Nader (Peyman Moadi). His wife wants to leave the country but he feels that he must remain to look after his father who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and, when she goes to stay with her parents, he is left to engage someone to look after his father and to support their daughter who is caught in the middle of this family crisis.What makes this film so special is the way the narrative twists and turns so that the viewer is not sure what is coming next and who to believe. The moral confusion portrayed here is really true to life and we see a very different picture of this theocratic state than is presented in the western media."
220,A Separation,5,22 April 2011,well organized but incomplete,"As a movie in drama genre, it seems that ""A Separation"" failed to present its characters thoroughly. The scenario has lots of potent characters to maneuver on them. In an attempt to depict all of them, Farhadi fails to present a deep picture of their emotional status quo in about 120 minutes. simply there are too much emotional relations: Nader and Simin, Nader and Terme, Nader and his father, Simin and Terme, Simin and Nader's father, Razieh and Hojjat, Razieh and her kid, Hojjat and his kid, Razieh and Nader's father, and The kid and Terme. Although these relationships create an opportunity for Farhadi to portray poignant moments by choosing some of them, but instead he waists them by trying to use all of them. Briefly, it could be a very good movie, but unfortunately it is too short comparing to load of characters it wants to introduce."
221,A Separation,4,27 March 2017,Average movie like many in Slavic countries,"I've hesitated for a long time, but yesterday I ""finally"" watched this movie with my wife.We were both very disappointed and surprised at the same time. It is hard to understand how a movie with such a high rating and positive reviews, could be just (below) average level: - the story is flat and far away of being unique - the acting is good but clearly not to be remembered - the atmosphere... I never felt so uninvolved in a movie like in this one Even the (praised) parts related to the Iranian culture and religion weren't something illuminating. Interesting but true... it was like watching some Slavic (ex Yugoslavia, Russia etc) movies from the 80's with a strong emphasis on socialist regime.In conclusion - a movie I would not recommend to any of my friends."
222,A Separation,3,6 January 2016,3/10 spoiler alert,"If you wanna see movie which has nonstop yelling and arguing this is for you. Seriously I got headache when I was watching this. This movie is so overrated. I don't understand. I had some really big thoughts about this film....and now I'm really disappointed. This is my first review and thats exactly why I'm giving it to this flick.3 Stars because they tried. But everything in this film is messy and stupid. Doesn't make any sense. Like why would that nanny lie about getting hit by car... Whole movie was about it. If she wouldn't lie, there would be no movie.And which I don't understand is people are rating this as 8-10. I bet there's some manipulated ratings..."
223,A Separation,7,1 November 2015,Amazing acting with an intriguing and complex story,"Watching films from across the globe has certainly been an interesting experience, and this film was pretty enjoyable to watch. The only thing I would say is that the film is a bit long, and seemed to go in circles for a bit, but is otherwise engaging.The acting is amazing, with the actors and actresses really giving emotion to their performances. Moaadi and Hatami as the separated husband and wife show the tension between their characters really well. Moaadi does really well with the debating scenes, as he has to argue before a judge multiple times. Hatami is also really good at delivering her lines, and the portrayal of her character's emotions definitely shines through. Bayat does a pretty good job too, though I did not really connect with her character.The script is well written and gives me more of a sense of Iranian culture. The film has a lot of speech and it was pretty incredible to watch them argue and debate about various events. The delivery was key, and they managed to pull it off. But because of the many arguments, it can be a bit hard to follow and at times is a bit heavy.Also, the story is pretty complex because of the many plots involved, and like the few International movies I watched before, there is no real conclusion. I was pretty peeved at the ending, but once I thought over it, I realized how conditioned I am to Hollywood films that I want a sense of closure every time. However, the way this film ended is pretty ingenious and it fits the characteristic of the film.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

225,A Separation,8,22 August 2012,Beautifully Executed Film,"This film is beautifully shot, acted and directed. The characters are complex and almost universally decent and sympathetic. It starts quite slowly, piling detail upon detail of the characters' lives onto the story. Eventually I realized what the main conflict was and I was drawn into it.All that said, in the end I was a bit bewildered as to what point the director/writer was making. He's so careful to be even-handed and fair to all of the characters that I'm not sure where his film finally lands, or what it is saying.I have strong expectations of a theme emerging in a film like this, but so far, just a few hours after having viewed it, I'm not sure what that theme is--something about the dilemma of lying for good reason, or the difference between the law and justice.Maybe someone here can help me out."
226,A Separation,8,21 August 2012,The Vidiot Reviews...,"A SeparationThe worst part of separating from your spouse is deciding who'll get to ignore the kids during the week and who gets to on the weekend.Fortunately, the offspring caught in-between her parents' separation in this drama is desired by both sides.A marriage is torn apart when Simin (Leila Hatami) decides she wants to flee Iran so her daughter (Sarina Farhadi) can have a better life.But her husband Nader (Peyman Moaadi) is resolved to care for his father who has dementia.With Simin gone, Nader hires a caretaker (Sareh Bayat), who later accuses him of causing her miscarriage when he expels her for stealing.With Nader facing murder charges, Simin must return and defend him.Using marital separation to analyze Iran's religious, sexual and class divisions, A Separation is an intense and indelible experience.Besides, estranged wives always return home once they start to miss their husband's farts.

227,A Separation,10,9 August 2012,A great mystery thriller made in Iran,"A separation is a suspense thriller like previous asghar farhadi's movies ;such as firework Wednesday and about Elly , a separation is a highly recommended film which won numerous awards such as academy award for best foreign language film as well as golden globe for the same category and golden bear for best film from Berlin film festival and so on...I don't wanna spoil this great movie i just give you a little clue about it . this is about an Iranian couple that impend to divorce because Simin (Leila Hatami) wants to leave the country to provide a better life for her daughter but Nader (Peyman Moadi)is disagreed with her because he can't leave his old father suffering from Alzheimer.it's one of the best-directed movies I've ever seen with a very strong and twisted script , the performances are flawless specially Peyman Moadi as Nader and Sare Bayat as Razieh I give it 10 and I highly recommend this great movie"
228,A Separation,,13 November 2011,Descent movie!,"Being a Indian national my view towards this movie are different than the local viewers for sure.Some of my synopsis/observation as follows :- Subject is different which made this movie ""very interesting"". Movie shows image of today's Iran i.e. a father allows his daughter to fill petrol in their car and she talks with the man at petrol/gas station. Another thing to notice relevant to movie, the med ""cleans the old man"" which seems to be an odd job in Iran for a woman. [ I can assume that Iran as being Islamic republic country ]. Few more things to notice, the wife of accused man still supports him though they are separated. Over all this movie is worth to watch but with English subtitles otherwise very difficult to understand ""important"" conversations if you don't understand ""Farsi"" language. Also if observed the man tells her daughter not to say ""Arabic"" word for an English word which she want to answer in school. He insists her to use ""Farsi"" word. :-) Slow movie. Not many gestures by main actor,actress and their daughter. But still a worth to watch movie."
229,A Separation,10,21 April 2017,It's good,"A Separation captures your attention so well because it deals with everybody's fear of trying hard, but ending up with nothing. It seems like the characters in the movie tries their hardest but still falls short, because of their flaws. I recommend it for its honesty and frankness, I do not recommend it for a Friday night movie with friends."
230,A Separation,10,6 April 2017,A Separation - An Intriguing Drama,"A SeparationAsghar FarhadiPersian language is foreign to me,but after spotting so many flawless movies from Iran, it is high time I learn it. The Separation movie is about a couple trying to get a divorce or that's what it looks at first. The movie is well-scripted and there are no repetitive dialogues. The movie starts as a simple one and transcends into a court-room drama. The fact that the camera doesn't change much adding with the expressions on all the characters makes it so natural and the viewers can feel as if its happening before them.A Separation questions our ethics and puts us in a moral dilemma. The characterization is noteworthy, every character has a certain trait they are related with. Nadar, the lead character is a responsible person and never fails to serve his ailing father with Alzheimer's, he also has the trait of thinking clearly under duress without clouding his judgement. His wife Simin on the other hand,always tries her best to control every situation. Termeh, is their daughter who is under a lot of pressure undergoing puberty and tries very hard to unite her parents from getting divorced.The viewers attention is required as the movie is kinda fast-paced and the dialogues are dynamic. the movie is full of uncertainity and unpredictable actions . The dialogues always stirs some kind of emotions in us.The climax scene was worth mentioning, how Temreh was put in a tough spot to choose between her parents, it will bring tears to anybody's face. And of course, Asghar Farhadi didn't fail to use hi cliff- hanger ending here also. The movie won an Oscar for the best foreign film 2012 and was nominated for the best screenplay and best writing. It also won a Golden globe for the best foreign film 2012. If this review didn't want to make you watch, I don't know what will."
231,A Separation,,20 January 2017,A sociological Masterpiece,"Iranian film Jodaeiye Nader az Simin is a drama, which emphasizes on social struggle with telling a story about separation of a couple. Way of storytelling in the film has a really wide and realistic perspective. Asghar Farhadi who is the director and writer of the film gives us an opportunity to focus on sociological subjects which are about class struggle and gender issues in the society with this rich script. All characters in the movie are really life-based and realistic. So, it's really useful to examine female characters' role in this movie from the different feminist views which brings us this question; ""Are some specific women experiences common to all women or are they also shaped by other facts?""My comment about this question is Farhadi's view about women experiences more suits with the post-modernist feminist ideas which emphasizes on women's experiences are shaped by other facts, such as class, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation. Women characters of the movie are the examples of that. However, it also fits with the common women experiences idea in some ways too. Considering women's position in Iran, just because they are women, movie gives us an idea about common women experience: Abiding man domination.However, as I said because of the characters it seems it more focuses on the shaped women experiences idea. Mary Wollstonecraft's critique against the view that treated everyone implicitly as males, and regarding their sex could be helpful to compare female characters in the movie. Mary Wollstonecraft's emphasizes that differences between men and women were largely cultural and can be altered by education. In the movie, differences between characters of Simin and Razieh are mostly based on that reason. The character of Simin, as presented in the movie, is more liberal one. The relationship between her husband shows that, she simply doesn't accept male domination in the institute of marriage. Her attitude is more liberal than Razieh who has more conservative tendencies. Such as relationship between her husband Hojjat. Their relationship suits more the way of patriarchy, than Simin's marriage. Even their ways of dressing are really different. Considering they live in the same country, under the same rules, it would be expected they would be more similar, but they are not. For the explanation of this situation, Wollstonecraft's theory could be helpful. As I see, their differences are mostly cultural which are caused because of their environment, and the level of education. Because we know different experiences bring different standpoints. It's also fixes with Patricia Hill-Collins theory too.To sum up, Jodaeiye Nader az Simin is such a modern time classic, with its rich script and successfully directing. It gives us an opportunity to examine society from different points. My examination is more focus on the idea that women experiences are shaped by the other factors which are mostly cultural and educational in this movie."
232,A Separation,,29 July 2016,special,"precise. bitter. more than realistic. universal message. about social pressure, decision, sacrifice, victims and force of fight. maybe, about hope. it is easy to admire the art of director, the performances. or to define it as an Iranian story. in fact, it is one of films who propose the honesty of viewer in an useful exercise of empathy. to remain or to fight for a basic right. the manner to present the steps of a difficult way, not proposing solutions but only give aspects of the effort to solve a delicate problem is the great virtue of a film about family. about responsibilities, decisions and answers to challenges. the precise delicacy to define the pieces of a hard game is the axis of a film who becomes experience. the freshness of the portrait of each character. this is the key for admire this real special film."
233,A Separation,10,4 July 2016,excellent social movie,"We need to know what's worth seeing and visiting We are not deterred.The film is worth seeing and art criticism with friends. Excellent Social Movie Has won many awards.If mainstream cinema leaves you soulless, see this film. If you have a modicum of intelligence, see this film. If you like great acting and directing, see this film. If you like great writing and editing, see this film. If you have an interest in law, see this film. If you are a parent, see this film.* A Separation is not harrowing or depressing. Fear not as I did before.Yes worth seeing !"
234,A Separation,9,2 December 2015,Wow....,"A Separation is an Iranian drama following the breakdown of a marriage. The wife wants to leave Iran with their daughter for a better life, while the husband refuses to go since he needs to look after his father, who has Alzheimers. Just read that simple set up and watch it. A Separation will knock you off your feet. It looks like just another marriage drama. It is so much more than that. The film is slightly slow paced at first, but once it gets going it doesn't pause for breath. Despite being a simple story with no big shocks, no massive emotional breakdowns, no explosions and a story which stays entirely grounded in the real world, it's more intense than most action films and more compelling than any Summer Blockbuster. The film is realistic and everything feels like it could happen, and this is enhanced by the excellent direction. The strength of the direction is that it's completely invisible and its devastating effects hit the audience with brilliant subtlety. Even if you don't normally watch foreign language films you should be able to relate to this. It's a universal film with, thanks to its complexity, something for everyone.The acting is outstanding and brilliantly raw, even from the young actress. What needs to be talked about the most is the script. Every character is fully developed, believable and sympathetic to the very end. Even when you don't agree with their choices, you can understand them. The characters are hardly even characters in the end. They're human. The film is morally complex, consistently unpredictable, endlessly tense and emotionally devastating. It's a very rewarding film to watch, but it's no easy ride. It is a pretty extraordinary movie and it completely deserved the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 2011. It's one of the better films of the decade so far and far better than many films nominated for Best Picture in the decade so far. Although not a perfect movie, in some ways that makes it more effective as it catches you off guard and then once the drama gets going it becomes really hard to watch. This is intense stuff, but it's well worth watching.9/10"
235,A Separation,10,27 September 2015,IMDb told me not to shout in the summary... coz i wrote W A T C H  IT,"First of all, if you think Bollywood and Hollywood are the only 2 Types of movies... Then you are completely wrong.This Iranian movie tops most of Hollywood movies and almost all of Bollywood in Drama Genre... Generally the movies only show the perspective of the leading character or In Bollywood i should say - perspective of hero.... But this movie really shows that being a hero and villain are 2 sides of the same coin... Not any movie ever before presented the feelings of a children like this when their parents goes through the process of being divorced... Let me tell you something... Do yourself a favor... W A T C H I T..."
236,A Separation,10,5 September 2015,Perspective of east side of the world,"First of all; I have to qualify the director who is Asghar Farhadi. He has a brilliant point of view and approach to facts.. He was observing very well the classical and general problems of east side of the world..And I think, he achieved to reflect to the screen successfully..If I have to summarize this movie briefly ,it would be that: Fathers have most important role to keep family all together.. Because whole problem derive to father's contradiction between his wife and father.. I think, that's the one of the biggest problem modern era..And then, story is going on..I strongly recommend this movie because of deeply touched to the human soul..I strongly recommend this movie because of people have to understand that, a separation between parents is mostly hurting the children.."
237,A Separation,9,21 February 2015,moving and brutally frank,Something peculiar made me deeply drawn to this film. It was very raw and simple and oh so real I was so indulged in it I almost forgot it was just a movie... apart from the great yet very simple plot it was also the actors with their outstanding performance that charged the movie with this flow of deep genuine emotions and made it roughly analogous to all the absurdity and pain we experience in our lives. One clear example is how we're forced in some way to sympathize with almost each character and not having the ability to judge or categorize any of them under some label.i think delivering this idea with this raw genuine attitude is what makes this film a mind blowing one.
238,A Separation,10,30 January 2015,Cinema doesn't get more realistic than this !!!!!,"I think it will be slightly unfair to call A Separation just a film. This for me was more than a film, it was an experience. The film is littered with moments where the line dividing fiction and reality in the minds of the viewers get completely dissolved. Any one of us can be involved in the situations that the characters in the movie have to deal with. Any one of us can picture ourselves in the shoes of any of the characters. The director Asghar Farhadi excels in making us a part of their lives and putting us firmly in the middle of the struggles and dilemmas that the characters go through and compels us to mentally imagine what we would have done in a similar situation. The film at the basic level is a family drama about a husband and wife going through tough times in their marriage with their young teenage daughter caught in the middle. Both the parties have arguments which are completely understandable. Every character is real and the points of views can be easily felt by the viewers due to the masterful storytelling. However Farhadi elevates the film from being just a drama to a subtle social commentary of life in Iranian society in the 21st century which is still tightly enveloped by religious practices and beliefs. Farhadi subtly shows the status and the position of women in his country's society. He shows how even progressive thinkers are bound to feel suffocated at times due to the boundaries and barriers that they are subjected to. What is a sin and what is not in the eyes of God, is a question that looms large in the conscience of the general mass. What he shows is how people can hold assumptions about certain people because of the class of society that they belong to.The brilliant screenplay puts characters in positions where class and background get distorted and they engage in conversations and quarrels by bringing all the issues at the forefront. Farhadi asks us to make up our mind without giving answers himself, and he does so without making any character tough to sympathise with.A Separation boasts of one of the most masterful performances that I have ever seen from an entire cast. Everyone is brilliant , but for me this film belongs to Payman Maadi and Sarina Farhadi. Both of them convey everything that they have to with their eyes and gestures and when they have to speak, their vocal delivery is perfect.The film is an absolute treat with masterful directing, masterful acting and an absolutely amazing script. I generally don't use this word very loosely, but for A Separation, I think the word 'masterpeice' can be justifiably used."
239,A Separation,9,23 December 2014,That's definitely a separation!,"This movie is just so real. Almost every scene is perfectly made. The movie is full of social issues most of them happen in different societies like getting a divorce and it discusses the reasons that lead to it and, of course, the consequences that follow such decisions. The movie also mentions the problems that happen to the children under these circumstances and the relations between them and both parents. It also contains the relationship between a son and his old sick father. As we know him, Asghar Farhadi made every single moment in this movie thrillingly filled. The movie won an Oscar for best foreign language film and it completely deserves it. And Asghar Farhadi got a nomination for best writing, original screenplay.This movie is definitely his best so far."
240,A Separation,9,15 April 2017,A best movie to watch,Though no heroes no villain no dance no mega and big budget movie it is the one of the best movie i have ever seen till this day. it shows how a divorce lead to pity situation of a family along with unemployment problem leading to divorce and impact on a children.This happens ever day in ever nook and corner of a country when a simple act leads to separation of a family
241,A Separation,10,30 September 2016,one of the best movies ever seen,"it is worth watching for many different reasons: as an insight into different (not western culture) as unique in proceeding to discover the full truth as a testimony about our world and our beliefs for very interesting and well created characters you may find answers to some questions about values we believe in our life it's also show different culture and how people may think in the world, where sin and God are not only instrumental - you may of course come to many different and counteractive conclusions, but at least is worth to see the world from different perspective I watched that movie because is on 100 best movies of XXI century, but opposite to a few others that one would recommend for watching"
242,A Separation,4,21 July 2015,Another brick in the wall,"Although I enjoyed the movie since it's a part of my learning of Farsi, I didn't really find the catharsis that I expected in the beginning. the movie was quite rushing to the end without a careful consideration to what we, commoners, could have caught with these accelerating events. In my opinion, the producer couldn't implicate the viewer to be a accomplice in his project of depicting the under world of the Iranian family, namely, the ghost of divorce. What are we supposed to do as viewers? the cast didn't let us in. Also, the climax was a little mountain that took but minutes. Added to that, the movie hints at the cultural breach or xenophobic trend toward what is Arabic. In one of the scenes when the daughter was rehearsing some vocabulary with the help of the father she came across some words that are from Arabic and she chose them. The reaction of the father was negative by stating that it should not be Arabic. Yes, Farsi is considered among the oldest languages in the world but that didn't prevent it from borrowing or loaning new words like "" mother"", ""father"",..etc."
243,A Separation,10,19 September 2014,A very important and a highly realistic film that is a must watch.,"A very important and a highly realistic film that is a must watch.It took time to settle down, after I watched it. It did something to me, something I can't say much about. It made me feel uncomfortable, though there is no violence of even one discomforting scene, it did make me feel a little untruthful and left me with a quilt of being dishonest too at times.It's a film that is realistic all through and thanks to the makers and actors. Oh, so fine realistic acting is something which is rare. And thanks to the director Asghar Farhadi who has given us a film that is very honest in making and in portrayal too. To envision the whole reaction of a character is first, we must be in that character's position to empathise with him/her and then write the emotion. Then get some actor to show us exactly what we need from him. Now Asghar had envisioned the whole of it and did it brilliantly.It's unbelievably real right form the word go and thanks for the cameraman who has done an outstanding job. Just look at the beginning scene where the couple walk out and we understand that it is a real place and not a set. It's difficult to make films in a country that is typically still fundamental and fanatical like Iran. I don't mean to offend Iran people but I seriously think Iran has to come to terms with freedom of speech and expression. Now, the whole film that looks so real is made with a shoe string budget of $25000 that is just nearly 12.5 lakh rupees. How many stories can we tell with such money, very very few. So it's all in writing and planning of execution and that's what this film shows. Casting is greatly done and acting is supreme by the cast.Yet, above all that, it's honesty that the film is meant with. It's hard to bequeath any emotion that any character underwent in this trial of ""A Separation"". Editing is supremely done and even as the credits kept on rolling, it made me yearn for more. I wanted to know whom the girl chose, is it the father or the mother. It's a real tough deal to get a whole story being revolved around an accident and then try to make it really engaging. All it takes is good writing and good acting. 'Separation has now I believe deserved all the accolades it has won, and I wish such films to be coming out more from Iran.A separation is not a film that separates you from it. It's a film that makes you a part of it and engages you as a viewer. I go with 5/5 for great movie that has minimal scenes and characters and still has good writing and acting and camera work that made it the best film of the year. Don't miss an opportunity to watch it."
244,A Separation,,18 August 2014,"""A Separation"" is one of the best foreign films of all time! A truly brilliant story!","Family issues have never seen so relatable and tense than in the Iranian film ""A Separation."" We see stressed characters battle through a anti- women society as we forget about our own problems after being drawn into an at first seemingly functional but separated family after we reach a major turning point that challenges our reactions and mind to determine our feelings for each character and are separated from learning the truth about the conclusion. Nader (Peyman Moaadi) is a kind family man who cares about his family deeply by taking care of his elderly father with Alzheimer's and loving his daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) deeply. However, his wife Simin (Leila Hatami) is trying to divorce Nader and leave Iran to travel abroad. When Nader hires a maid named Razieh (Sarah Bayat) to take care of his father, he finds his father off his bed and injured, blaming Razieh. Nader gets into an argument with Razieh causing him to push her down a set of apartment stairs. Nader finds out she is in the hospital for a miscarriage, not knowing she was pregnant, causing a string of family tension, trust issues and a breakdown as to how the marriage between Nader and Simin will end and how the court will react to the death of an unborn. What's interesting about this foreign masterpiece is how much we get absorbed in the situation and how the trials and mystery behind how Razieh's baby is a parallel to the marriage portrayed due to the couple being separated and the truth behind the case being separated. Ironically, none of the characters are separated in the film. Almost every time there is more than one character in the shot they interact with each other. Whether it's by talking, fighting or comforting, we see various relationships change and join in the process. It's also a very unpredictable story. It catches you off guard. The first 45 minutes or so show the basic lifestyle of our characters and shape the future of the film. Once it gets about halfway done, you'll be tested to form opinions about each character. Nader shows a simple man who is extremely loyal to his family but takes risky consequences. Razieh shows the lifestyle of a woman jaded by her society and living with lies and fear. The daughter Termeh is a light of goodness and integrity who has morals no young woman can relate to. Each character is so easy and fascinating to study due to masterful writing and mesmerizing work by these gifted and natural actors who bare all their emotions. The mystery behind this film as to how the baby perished tests us and provokes us far beyond any film in recent years. Writer/director Asghar Farhadi sets up this story beautifully and gives international audiences a mind-teaser that is both powerful and entertaining. Farhadi also shows his culture shockingly and almost shows how Iran is a mess in terms of how unjust it is towards females and how messed us the law system is. The end that this genies filmmaker sets up leaves us separated from knowing how it ends and leaves us to interpret this mystery. This film will keep you thinking for days and show a new from of cinema that few American artist have tackled."
245,A Separation,10,15 June 2014,One of the greatest movies since Head-On (Fatih Akin),"A Separation is one of these movies that stuck in your mind for long. I can name only few that had the same effect on me such as Head-On (Fatih Akin), The Banishment (Andrey Zvyagintsev), The Hunt (Thomas Vinterberg).In a nutshell this movie is about the separation of two people. On a deeper level, this movie is the allegory on modern Iran. Just like the above mentioned ones talk about the cultural background of Turkey (or Turkish culture in Germany), Russia and Norway. These movies don't judge, but open an important discussions. They are great because they have the elements of documentary movies, they talk about ordinary people with a real problems."
246,A Separation,9,31 May 2014,An instant neorealist classic from Iran,"""Had me on the edge of my seat"" may not be a phrase that turns up too much in reviews of Iranian films, and I was surprised that this subtle, complex meditation on marital, generational, interfamily and class conflict also happens to have a steamroller plot, once it really gets going. The script and pacing are just about perfect: The tension builds and complications mount just long enough, then everything's resolved with the brilliant simplicity of a folktale. Sharp, sensitive performances; provides a fascinating perspective on the sharia-based Iranian legal system and the role that religion plays in everyday life. (Good to know that in Tehran there's an Islamic hotline you can call if, say, you're a pious home attendant taking care of an old guy who's peed his pants and you want to know if it would be in accordance with Islamic law for you to change him.) FYIwhen characters talk about 40 million or 15 million (rials), in 2011, this was equivalent to about US$6000 or 2500, resp."
247,A Separation,8,16 April 2014,AN EXCELLENT watch,"a great indeed excellent film full of idea that keep the film moving and grips the (i.e. this) viewer. It has a twist in every other scene, -- quite unusual as one associates 'twists' in film with the horror/thriller genres - But this is a brilliantly told story, as realistic as it could be, and like I say, rolls along like a dynamo. Some of the critics on this site seem to expect more from it because it's a foreign language production or a 'world' movie; but that's subjective. If I was Iranian, and I went to the local cinema and saw this I would be very proud. Also, I disagree with those who say it's sexist; the male characters portrayed are flawed to say the least.When I say it's 'realistic' I admit I can't say how accurate the portrait of the Iranian justice system is, I have never been there, but I was left with an indelible insight. Not just into that but also human relations"
248,A Separation,10,9 March 2014,One the best all time movies,"When your friends phone you and thank you for directing them towards a wonderful experience ,you know that your judgement is on the right track. I was utterly enthralled with this movie, a tale from Iran that showed us that all societies work much the same at the family level. People get fed up with each other, children complicate loving relationships and the legal system is an almost impenetrable maze.I learned that Iranians suffer just the same way we do in the Western World and that government ideologists don't really impact our day to day lives as much as the maniacal press would have us believe.In this touching and poignant tale we are treated to a level of quality in the acting that I didn't think was possible from this country. There is a gentleness to it that carries you along, helping you identify with the characters and the emotions that they are able to transfer to you.A truly transformative film with everything presented in an understated, yet paradoxically stark, style.If the director can keep his head after all of the acclamation heaped on him, we should be lining up to see his next effort. For fans of this type of movie I would recommend trolling through some of the Chinese movies that have been released in the past few years. Many deal with real relationships like this and the impact of the incredible social changes that have knocked them sideways. There are some gems to be found, ""Shower"" is one of the best ones.Enjoy BillC"
249,A Separation,10,23 February 2014,A Separation's Review,"A Separation was directed by Asghar Farhadi. It stars Leila Hatami as Simin, and Peyman Moadi as Nader, and Shahab Hoseini as Hodjat. The movie won an Oscar in 2012 for Best Foreign Language film. The movie is set in Iran in 2012. It was filmed on location in Tehran.It's about a family that the wife of family (Simin) wishes to live abroad to give a better life to her eleven year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) but Nader wants to stay to take care of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) that has Alzheimer. Simin moves to the house of her mother and Nader hires the Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father while he is working. Razieh is pregnant but she does not tell her husband Hodjat, who owes large amount to the creditors, that she is working. When she arrives with her daughter Somayeh (Kimia Hosseini) at Nader's house, she distracts and Nader's father goes to the street and she goes and gets him back home. On the next day, when Nader arrives home with Termeh, they find Nader's father tied up to his bed and Razieh and Somayeh are not at home. When they arrive at home, Nader accuses Razieh of theft and expels her. Razieh feels offended and argues with him, and Nader pushes her out at the front door. Razieh falls and has an abortion. She goes to the court with her husband and the witnesses are summoned to testify. I strongly recommended ""A Separation"" for any cinema lover or people who are interested in learning a little about the Iranian culture. If you like great acting, directing, writing and editing see this film."
250,A Separation,9,16 February 2014,A Slice of Humanity,"It is very easy to look at this unruly planet of ours as a place of many exotic different cultures. And it certainly is, at least at first sight. But people are people and their troubles and heartaches might seem surprisingly familiar no matter where they come from. Iran with it's fundamentalist approach to Islam, definitely seems a mind-boggling place for a Westerner, but in spite of hijabs, chadors and religious beards, there is so much more than that. Intellectual couple torn by the duty towards a child and a senile parent, and another struggling, in debt couple who's last resort seems to be drowning in the boiling cauldron of showy piety. And with them and next to them just people trying to live normal life in less than normal circumstances. The same could apply to many countries, including ours, but this movie shows this single story with focused, almost brutal calm. When it all ends with the final separation, the viewer feels that gentle throb in his chest, the one that makes eyes misty. A slice of humanity."
251,A Separation,10,2 February 2014,Best Story,"this is the best Story i have ever seen, excellent feeling and Real, I'm recommending it to every-one I know. when nobody is clearly guilty and the line between black and white is so dim ou can't leave your chair even for one second because the story never lets you to lose even a single moment Asghar Farhady's obsession with the concept of judgment is once again the driving force behind his latest feature The first thing you read on the screen is ""In the name of God"". Well, anyway it's the best story And then the screw turns, although most of the story takes place in everyday Iranian life. The center of it all is perhaps the daughter, who is nearly teared apart. But it takes time until you realize that. Anyway, I can almost guarantee you sit the film through, until the final post-texts has passed."
252,A Separation,,1 February 2014,Farces in Farsi,"Written and directed by Asghar Farhadi, ""A Separation"" watches as Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi), an Iranian husband and wife, drift toward divorce. The film then switches gears and becomes a murder mystery, Nader accused of inducing a miscarriage in Raziah, his employee.Much of Farhadi's film watches as Termeh, the couple's daughter, struggles with issues of truth, justice and family loyalty. Should she support her father, who may have accidentally killed a child, or her mother, who longs to leave Iran? As Termeh pines for connection and reconciliation, the rest of Farhadi's cast seem hell-bent on drifting apart. They're separated along economic and cultural lines, some bank clerks, some houseworkers, some unemployed, some wrestling with questions of finance and faith. Farhadi's blocking and editing also stress a certain exclusion, characters separated by doorways, veils, staircases and windowpanes.Farhadi's previous film, ""About Elly"", was preoccupied with class divisions. With ""A Separation"" we see semi-secular urbanites (Nader and Simin) clashing with a more conservative, God-fearing couple (Raziah and her husband, Hodjat). But though a portrait of an Iran that is in the throes of an identity crisis, seemingly pulling in two different directions at once (""What is so wrong with Iran?"" a judge asks), Farhadi is careful not to taint either side. Simin, a strong, modern woman, is initially chastised for wanting to leave Iran, her husband and his dying father, but becomes a hero of sorts later on. Raziah and Hodjat's relationship, meanwhile, may seem volatile, a parody of patriarchal domesticity, but he worships her, defers to her judgement, and it is her God which gives Raziah a sense of ethics which surpasses even the morality of the more self-serving Nader. Even Hodjat's violent outbursts throughout the film are portrayed sympathetically; the guy's just lost his child.""A Separation"" won the foreign-language film Oscar, as well as a slew of other awards (the Golden Bear at Berlin). With much of the Western world (UK, US, France) and elsewhere (Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey etc) hell-bent on nuking Iran and sucking on its resources, ""A Separation"" does well to contest, albeit unintentionally, various racist stereotypes. One must remember that Iran has essentially been subject to a sixty year propaganda campaign and covert war (as well as the West's backing of Saddam Hussein in his overt, eight year war against Iran). To many, the perception is that Iran is a backward land populated by sexist lunatics, snarling bogeymen and homophobes (the UK ""legalized homosexuality"" in 1967, the US essentially did the same in 2003 by repealing sodomy laws). That she's a modern nation state which houses people of all shades and beliefs is a fact lost on many. Even her much disparaged civil rights records  Iran's government is indefensible, moronic and brutally repressive - puts many Western puppets/allies to shame, is in many ways causally related to British/CIA actions, and betters the contemporary and past human rights track-records of most major superpowers.Interestingly, Iran's government has a conflicted relationship with ""A Separation"". They praise it for its oversees success, and even some of its writing, but also chastise it for drifting from the party-line. Like the characters in Farhadi's film, Iran's censors aren't quite sure where to stand. Farhadi's film itself contains various judicial figures who epitomise Iran's ideological hypersensitivity. These judges preside over lies, absurdities, are unconcerned about truth, and spring into action only when their authority is challenged.Fittingly, the film ends with Termeh faced with a choice: to leave Iran or to stay with daddy. Farhadi's hinting at a nation's uncertain future, but we know with some certainty how history unfolds. Months after Farhadi's Oscar win, Hassan Rouhani was elected President of Iran, a ""moderate"" cleric who marks another small step toward further human rights and gender equality. It took Britain hundreds of years to separate church, state, monarchs and overthrow the Divine Right Principles (the country is still symbolically theocratic). The United States skipped all that and went straight to cigars, oval office fellatio and bombing for Jesus. How long will Iran's theocratic Assembly of Experts last? And more importantly, how much will progress depend on Iran's real-life Simins and Termehs fighting rather then fleeing? It's a question which Farhadi himself asks. ""Every time you face trouble, you give in rather than confront it,"" Nader tells his wife, a tactful woman whom Farhadi eventually reveals to be expert at diffusing dangerous situations.8/10  See Mohsen Makhmalbaf's ""Kandahar"" and Zhang Yimou's ""The Story of Qiu Ju""."
253,A Separation,9,31 December 2013,An Iranian Family story for All families,"I will confirm any praise to this movie. In a non-European, non-western, 'Islamic' society, a global issue in a family could hardly be portrait better and would be served to the clear comprehension of anyone without any bias and irrelevant conceptualization. There is no politics, no propaganda -at least not like the explicit ones in Hollywood.- You can read the plot but don't do it; you will face a simple family week just distracted with behaviors led by inner psychological situation which sides do not want to express. A though decision (divorce) and events taking place aftermath are narrated without any explicit expression of what is lying beneath. You are experiencing a clear picture of the wisely and pure logically knitted incidents without any intervention and comment by director/narrator/writer. People are to manage the crisis with 'compulsory' communication with various means to convey the messages; including perfect catchwords and dialogues. This simple story will make you reconsider: 1. Family relations 2. Role of daughter between parents especially during the period of adolescence 3. What can be a concrete reason to a divorce passing over abstract reasons and the shared past to stay together. 4. Elder-care at home 5. Law, court and justice .....Personally I felt the burden and the stress of the events and was forced to empathize the psychology and struggle of an adolescent girl between divorcing parents."
254,A Separation,10,4 August 2016,"Amazing, beautiful, awesome","Simin wants to leave the country with her husband, Nader, and daughter, Termeh, as the former does not want Termeh to grow up under the prevailing conditions. This desire is not shared by Nader, who is concerned for his father, who lives with the family and suffers from Alzheimer's disease. When Nader determines to stay in Iran, Simin files for divorce.The family court judges the couple's problems insufficient to warrant divorce and rejects Simin's application. She leaves her husband and daughter and moves back in with her parents. On the recommendation of Simin, Nader hires Razieh, a young, deeply religious woman from a poor suburb, to take care of his father while he is at work. Razieh has applied for the job without consulting her hot-tempered husband, Hodjat, whose approval, according to tradition, would have been required. Her family is financially dependent on the job, and she takes her daughter to the house with her.Razieh soon becomes overwhelmed by taking care of Nader's father, which is physically and emotionally demanding. She finds the work very heavy, especially as she is pregnant."
255,A Separation,8,26 September 2014,This film by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi would generate different interpretations from different viewers.,"With the massive availability of entertainment at the click of a mouse, all national cinemas need to innovate in order to stay in the race as the competition to produce 'excellent films' is becoming tougher day by day. This is also true about many Asian cinemas which have hitherto relied heavily on exotic elements in order to win awards at film festivals as well as viewers in cinemas. At this juncture, it is a positive news that Iranian cinema has moved from its ubiquitous depiction of children. This is a constructive development for those who closely monitor its development as there are other better stories to be told than producing feature films about the lives of cute little ones. After watching the initial five minutes of ""A Separation"" nobody would fail to understand the reason why a large part of Western world got interested in it. For a vast majority, it clicked as it has 'divorce' as its main focus. However, the film doesn't waste any time to change its principal focus to concentrate more on mistakes made by two protagonists : a man who cares more about his father and his independent wife who has her own beliefs. What is important to note is that both the parties are equally right about issues related to modernity and tradition. The film presents a primordial ethical dilemma : What to choose, How to choose and Why to choose ? More and more Asian societies are confronted with dilemma of this kind because as small children, it is extremely difficult to take proper care of old people. As a screen writer, director Asghar Farhadi has superb imagination as there are various twists and turns in the story but his film is dotted with moments where minor yet crucial things don't seem to fit well. Like all films, ""A Separation"" too has its fair share of glaring inconsistencies : How can a young girl child have the kind of maturity which one expects from grown up children especially in her manner of answering questions and putting questions ? How can a physically feeble old man suffering from Alzheimer's disease have the ability to go out all alone on a busy street ? Apart from these minor glitches, there are some scenes where deliberate padding is equally evident which somewhat lessens the seriousness of this film. For example : The adolescent girl reading a passage about class differences in Iranian society. Although the film is replete with 'dénouements', one better than the other, the film doesn't have any other ""wow factor"". Nevertheless, it succeeds in winning numerous hearts due to its humane subject matter. As a film is the subjective affair of viewers, it can be rightly said that generalizations wouldn't work in the case of his film as all people have the right to behave in the manner which suits their personalities. In hindsight, this film is a grim reminder of all the family issues which the Western world seems to have forgotten. It doesn't shy away in presenting its philosophical underpinnings. It is as if all the 'ifs' and 'buts' of ordinary people's mundane lives have been rolled in a single story to deal with ethical issues which director Asghar Farhadi valiantly attempts to tackle. On a lighter note, if a humorous ""Making Of"" is appended to end credits, there is all possibility of seeing everybody involved in the production of this film especially actors laughing with joy over the phenomenal success achieved by this film. Finally, no review will do justice to this film if one doesn't mention the plight of two innocent, little girls who have to suffer a lot in this film due to their parents' capricious as well as irresponsible behavior. May the children never suffer anywhere in the world !!!!"
256,A Separation,9,13 October 2013,A masterpiece. One of the best movies ever made anywhere!,"This movie is something that we like to call ""perfection"". Its a great movie and one of the best ever foreign films. Its got the class of highest standard and the direction, cast, acting, and everything you need in a masterpiece movie in the perfect fashion. It shows the Iranian society, the human nature, the laws and its flaws, righteousness and if you want a deep meaningful film with perfect class to blow your mind, this is it. The acting is superb, by an amazing cast and the drama in the film will keep you interested till the credits. Just watch it and I hope you are among those 99 out of 100 people to see it as a A+ movie."
257,A Separation,8,12 March 2012,"""Intricate, involving and concentrated...""","Iranian screenwriter and director Asghar Farhadi's fifth feature film which he also wrote and produced, was shot in Tehran, Iran and is an Iranian production which was produced without any government support. It tells the story about middle-class couple Nader and Simin who lives in an urban apartment with their 11-year-old daughter Termeh who is in school. They have been married for fourteen years, but Simin wants to move away from the country because she things that her daughter needs to grow up in a better place, but her husband does not want to move and has to take care of his aging father who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Simin files for divorce, but when her request is rejected by a family court she leaves her family and moves in with her parents while Nader tries to find a house worker who can look after his father. Asghar Farhadi's acutely and engagingly directed independent film draws an invariably moving portrayal of a modern day Iranian married couple's complicated separation and their adolescent daughter who his caught in the middle trying her utmost to prevent them from separating. With naturalistic urban milieu depictions and an intensifying stringent narrative structure, this well-paced, character-driven and dialog-driven story forms an intricate, involving and concentrated character drama about marriage, family relations, interpersonal relations, morality, social class differences and the human condition, which is reinforced by the empathic and compassionate acting performances by Iranian actresses Leila Hatami, Sareh Bayat and Sarina Farhadi (the director's daughter) and Iranian actors Peyman Moadi and Shahab Hosseini. A detailed and multifaceted mystery which gained, among numerous other awards, the Golden Bear, the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, the Reader Jury of the ""Berliner Morgenpost"", the Silver Berlin Bear for Best Actor Peyman Moadi and Shahab Hosseini and Best Actress Leila Hatami and Sareh Bayat at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival in 2011, the César Award for Best Foreign Film at the 37th César Awards in 2012, the British Independent Film Award for Best Foreign Independent Film at the 14th British Independent Film Awards in 2012 and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year at the 84th Academy Awards in 2012 which marked it as the first Iranian film to receive an Academy Award in this category and Asghar Farhadi the first Iranian director to receive an Academy Award in any category."
258,A Separation,10,12 July 2013,proud of a separation...,"This movie is from my country, me and all my people proud to this, because it shows our art to all over the world. that Iranian can and do in all steps and all levels of art every time. Asghar Farhadi we love you because you learn us the cinema, you learn us how to see the movie, how to see our life better. thanks a lot Mr.Farhadicongratulation to all Iranian all over the world to have this Iranian film. your new film came out (the past) 2013 and shines in Cannes 66 hope that you continue this way and show Iranian,s art to the world. and be sure that all of us are very happy to have this volunteer to world,s cinema, hope to Be successful more and more. I'm Mahdi Barkhordari"
259,A Separation,10,7 April 2012,Is it worth?,"It is certainly true that some Iranian movies,specially which are interested in the festivals have the constant sense content.However,While it seems that we are facing to steady story line,i don't agree that this film is boring or does not worth the Academy award.There are several reasons that some people have mentioned that this film is not observable.Firstly,They believe story line was lost during the emotional atmosphere.and it was not clear where many incidents occurred.Secondly,some of them believe that directing is not suitable for many appropriate subjects.even feminine zeal impede them to continue watching.For example Simin and Razieh caused many problems and they were lying.Finally,it was so boring without any attraction to be stay front of scene.However,with accepting some facts that are mentioned above,we should not forget that we are facing to very impressive facts that will shock us unconsciously in depth.how bodies are engaged simply not only with their society but with their own personality.Dilemma will come and noting to do.it is not easy as a audience to digest depth of reality of innocent teen's tear for unknown sin.simply they are our facts of life and we don't care.Story lines in this movie brilliantly designed to imply that.the big message of this big film is that no ""body is guilty ,but every body is"".Overall,My opinion is to be patient so we can discover not only the story .this is not about middle east,nor Asia nor Africa ,discover not only the story,but to discover ourself in all around the world."
260,A Separation,10,9 August 2017,Iranian culture of the people,"This film shows the culture and society of Iran. I myself am an Iranian and live in Iran. The lives of the Iranian people are largely influenced by Islamic culture. Many of the issues that are commonplace in the ordinary world in Iran are unusual and unresolved. Like sex and marital affairs. Many women in Iran are betrayed by their husbands, but they are forced to remain silent. The law does not defend women. The constraints on the part of the government, as well as the lives of the people of Iran, are showing up, and they really deserve the Scarecrow Prize."
261,A Separation,10,11 July 2017,A Masterpiece.,"If we like to think this movie as a color combination with black and white this movie did not turn out to be gray, just for some reason...I can say this is the best films of Asghar Farhadi by far Only Iranian society that can make a story like thisMake this movie to the list! 'A movies that people should see before they die'"
262,A Separation,9,27 June 2017,A spectacular film that will play with your emotion,"This movie stunned me while I watched it. It showed the emotions between husband & wife, father & daughter, son & father & it's beyond that. It also tells the story of human's belief in religion. It will show you that a moment's fault can cause a disaster to you. Watch the movie and you will not regret."
263,A Separation,10,10 June 2017,"An original, high-class, must-watch drama","A separation is about a man whose life got complicated because of a devastating incident after he separated from his wife. He then tries his best to keep calm and solve every problem in his life rationally, which includes desperate tries to keep his family together.This one is greatly about dialogues and drama between the families and inside the families, as well. But it is all together so breathtaking that you can't take your eyes of it. You also get to know just as many characters as necessary, which makes it easier to focus on everyone's state of emotions and their changes. A lot of twists and turns are contained in the story, so it keeps you entertained and excited the whole time. What I really liked is having that feeling when you can't decide which side you should take, when you feel so bad how circumstances were unmerciful for every single member of the two families that got involved in a really unpleasant situation that happened.Farhadi definitely knows how to produce a high-quality drama and induce a lot of viewers' tensity and compassion. It is also pretty realistic. Honestly, this is his best movie I have seen so far. That's why I've rewarded it with a 10/10"
264,A Separation,9,9 June 2017,A powerful cinematic piece based on characters deeply rooted in reality and certain interspersed incidents woven into an engrossing saga! [+94%],"What led me to watch 'A Separation' was in fact last year's Best Foreign Language Film Oscar Winner 'The Salesman' which had of course, made me take notice of the man behind the craft - Asghar Farhadi. While Iranian cinema as such remained relatively unknown to me, I was astonished by the way he had portrayed the events of 'The Salesman' carrying an element of suspense even while grounding the characters as realistically as possible.Boy, was I impressed with his 2011 directorial! It tells the story of a couple who are at loggerheads with each other over the decision of moving abroad for the betterment of their child or staying back to look after the husband's Alzheimer-diagnosed father. The plot line is as simple as it gets. An average viewer would even wonder what could be so path-breaking in a film with a synopsis such as this. Yet, the unfurling of incidents and how one thing leads to another is so well-cooked and meticulously crafted that every minute detail is bought into, including the reactions and expressions of each character with respect to various circumstances. Asghar does not let his screenplay flounder for one second. At 2h 3 min, the film is not what one would call a 'breezy watch' but it lets the viewer delve into the grayness associated with each human being. Asghar tries to say that even so-called rational human beings illustrate unexpected forms of behavior based on the context. The series of incidents that play out are simply repercussions of decisions taken by the lead characters and how the people in their life are forced to react due to the same. For example, the couple's only daughter (played by Asghar's own daughter Sarina) is coerced into deciding who she wants to stay with, on more than one occasion. It is (obviously!) not her call. She is only given the option of choosing between dad or mom. She knows she cannot have both, but still doesn't want to give up hope on them. The caregiver character (played by Sareh Bayat) who unintentionally infuses herself into the life of the couple is one that's written so carefully and depicted with an intensity that can match no other. She has her own reasons for the way she's acting, similar to the rest of the characters around her. But not for one moment does the cast go over-the-top. Peymaan Moaadi and Leila Hatami (who play the couple) are never observed to be ""acting"" at all..they're simply living the life of their characters and leaving their imprints behind. Even the sick dad character who barely speaks has left such a big impact with his presence. Kimia Hosseini who plays the caregiver's little daughter is spectacular with her expressions. Shahab Hosseini plays the distressed, unemployed husband of the caregiver to perfection. I can proudly say that there are countless number of stand-out scenes that are bound to stay with the viewer long after one has finished watching 'A Separation'. A few ones that immediately come to mind include the argument between Nader(the husband) and Razieh(the caregiver), the exchange between Nader and his daughter at the judge's office, the climax sequence where the caregiver's husband just implodes and storms out of the house, the powerful opening and closing scenes..the list is pretty huge.Even the message is not clear-cut. It is left for the viewer to formulate based on their own standpoint. Each time a (twisty) revelation is made, the viewer (along with the characters) goes into shell-shock. This indeed says a lot about the film and the impact that it leaves on its viewers. The theme is a depressing one, but the treatment is not. It does not attempt to employ the grim nature of the proceedings to affect the viewer into believing that a character is unabashedly right or wrong. They could be both right and wrong, depending on how you look at things. A masterpiece by all means, this film is highly recommended for all those who'd want to enjoy minimalist cinema at its purest. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing his 2006 venture 'Fireworks Wednesday'. (my viewing timeline is moving backwards but the quality seems to be going forward!)"
265,A Separation,8,8 June 2017,A Separation - Brilliant layering of complex human relations,"I was six years late to see this movie. I had downloaded this movie about 3 years back and was in my back up drive awaiting a watch. I watched it recently (2017) and I thank myself for making that decision because it opens up new vocabulary of cinema to students like us.The director Asghar Farhadi had seen a visual of a young man washing an old man  most probably his father, and that image stuck Asghar's mind that set the ball rolling to develop a story around it. This was the first Iranian movie to win an Oscar. It appeared in the top 250 films IMDb list and is mentioned in 1000 movies to see before you die.For those who are can't understand Persian I am including spoilers to understand and enjoy the movie better because the dialogues are fast and lengthy and it is difficult to catch them and keep track on first viewing.Simin (Leila Hatami) wants to leave Iran  either her husband Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and their daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi  director's real life daughter) come along with her or else she will divorce her husband. But husband can't leave his ailing egging father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease.Nader hires a pregnant Razieh (Sareh Bayat) who comes along with her daughter Somayeh (Kimla Hosseni) as a care-taker.An incident happens when Nader pushes care-taker Razieh out of the house on accusation of not properly taking care of his Dad and for robbing money. Razieh undergoes abortion and her husband Hojjat (Shahbad Hosseini) puts a case of murder against Nader.How all these characters interact and accuse each other, and each try to protect relationships, show humanity, and seek justice makes the rest of the movie.Each character has its own convincing persona that we can empathize with. Who is right? Who is wrong? How the events unfold the way they do  whom to blame  it is so beautifully presented with a fluid story telling.The plot is simple but the treatment is complex in terms of the facets of underlying human and cultural nuances popping up every now and then. The actors are top class. There is no music in the movie except the end titles. The movie is shot with hand-held camera. Editing is superb. The dialogues are layered and runs sub-plots that the audience have to weave together. Thus the movie makes the audience part of the proceeding  putting the view in middle of the family as a witness and observer. Superb..!The screenplay the way it unfolds is like a thriller, and lots of questions remain unanswered till the end of the movie but the movie surely leaves a few signs for the viewers to detect the missing clues.As the movie is already 6 years old, I am leaving a few spoilers for filling up the missing clues - that are not shown in the movie...First, the robbing of money accusation is false because Nader's wife Simin might have paid the money to workers who charges her extra for a work. Second, Nader pushing Razieh does not kill the child, but the child is killed a few days earlier when Razieh is hit by a car on the road in an attempt to bring Nader's father home. Third, the end of the movie showing both Nader and Simin wearing black clothes signify that the father is now dead and still they are going for divorce. Fourth, the ending is open  as the daughter's decision of - with whom she will go  father or mother - is not revealed and it is kept for the audience to guess based on what is shown in the movie.This was Director Asghar's fifth movie. Recently in 2017 his movie Salesman again won the Best Foreign Film award at the Oscars - his second Oscar.A movie is a must see for all movie buffs in terms understanding the art of cinema on how to integrate complex cultural pathos and broken human relationships with empathy where we as audience do not find fault with any character.I give it 8 out of 10"
266,A Separation,,28 April 2017,One of The Must Watch Movie,"It's A Must Watch Movie For Every Iranian Person... I Watched This Movie 3 Times... And Every Time I Watched It, I Never Tired of Watching... Because of The of Fascinating Story of Writing... And I Suggest To Iranian Persons To Watch This Movie At Least 1 Time... The Playing of Peyman Moadi And Leila Hatami is Perfect...And Is Also Attractive..."
267,A Separation,9,21 April 2017,Review of the movie,"This movie is definitely worth watching. The plot twists should be considered the most successful because they keep the audience watching until the end. In addition, the director clearly put the same effort for every twist, making it as unexpected as possible for the audience. Not only does the movie carefully portray endless conflicts among family members, but the movie also delivers a simple message to parents: everything they do will affect their child one way or another, which they have to consider carefully before any action. Lastly, this movie shows the audience a view on Iran's culture and religion. It is phenomenal how characters in the movie respect their gods; they are really serious when it is the matter of sins and swearing under the gods."
268,A Separation,8,5 February 2017,Asghar Ferhady Theme won,"DO you know why am i in love with Ferhady's picture ? It is so simple , because he has his own world and his own style . Ferhady as usual can tell us the story like he thought with his wonderful twists and full of much reality and faith . I believe that Ferhady really think that the separation is a very big problem in Iranian Society and he used this belief to tell us the story , the story of destroying families with separation , poor and old traditions . Ferhady is the best director who using open endings for his pictures , I believe that he uses it to give us hope , tell us that always there is a chance ."
269,A Separation,10,25 September 2016,Watch Afain,"an unhappily married couple break up in this complex, painful, fascinating Iranian drama by writer-director Asghar Farhadi, with explosive results that expose a network of personal and social faultlines. A Separation is a portrait of a fractured relationship and an examination of theocracy, domestic rule and the politics of sex and class  and it reveals a terrible, pervasive sadness that seems to well up through the asphalt and the brickwork. In its depiction of national alienation in Iran, it's comparable to the work of Jafar Panahi and Mohammad Rasoulof. But there is a distinct western strand. The film shows a middle-class household under siege from an angry outsider; there are semi-unsolved mysteries, angry confrontations and family burdens: an ageing parent and two children from warring camps appearing to make friends. All these things surely show the influence of Michael Haneke's 2005 film Hidden. Farhadi, like Haneke, takes a scalpel to his bourgeois homeland.These are modern people with modern problems. After 14 years of marriage, Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi) want to split. They live in a flat with their intelligent, sensitive 11- year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), and with Nader's elderly father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who suffers from Alzheimer's and is in need of constant care.Both of them work, and, ambitious for their daughter's education, they have hired a teacher from her school to come to this crowded flat to give her extra coaching for her imminent and crucial exams. But now Simin wants to leave Iran for a country where there are more opportunities for women generally and for her daughter in particular; Nader says it is out of the question. They must stay in Iran to look after his father.This debate has escalated into a demand for divorce. The very first scene shows the pair petitioning the equivalent of a magistrate for permission to proceed. This figure is not shown; the couple look directly into the camera and make their case, as it were, to us, the audience. In courtroom terms, this is something like an opening address to the jury, and the audience is invited not to decide who is right and who is wrong, but to see afresh that in such cases there is no right and wrong. Both have some justice on their side.AdvertisementAs the movie progresses, terrible things happen in a succession of unintended consequences. Flawed people behave badly and they will make ferocious appeals to justice and to law in preliminary hearings very similar to the divorce court, heard by harassed, careworn officials oppressed by the knowledge that there is no black and white, but numberless shades of grey. Despite the angry denunciations flying back and forth and the fizzing sense of grievance being nursed on both sides, the messy, difficult truth is that both parties can be justified, that all-or-nothing judicial war will bring destruction, and that some sort of face-saving compromise will somehow have to be patched up. The women see this, but not the men.When Simin and Nader part, and Simin leaves to live with her mother, an instant question presents itself  with no wife in the picture, who is to do the woman's work? Which is to say, who is to do the drab, menial work of cleaning the flat, and looking after Nader's poor, incapable father? Nader already has a modern wife who has a professional career and wants to go her own way. Now he needs a traditional wife, in all but name  a drudge. So through Simin's connections, they engage Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a woman with one small daughter, whom she will have to bring to work every day, and who also has a secret she is keeping from her prospective employer. Despite the tough work involved  a 90- minute commute and the necessity of looking after a confused and incontinent old man with no special training  Nader quibbles with her about pay and this humiliating exchange is to involve Nader in the lives of both Razieh and her own prickly husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini). The stage is set for a terrible confrontation.Class matters, as much as gender. One scene shows a group of people at the flat, relaxing and having fun, playing table football. Friends can join in, as well as family. But not Razieh. She is shown rather miserably getting on with something in the kitchen. When Termeh's teacher Miss Ghahraii (Merila Zare'i) comes round, she is treated as an honoured guest. She is, after all, teaching their daughter. But how about Razieh? She has an important family responsibility, too, looking after Nader's father. But she gets no respect. And she is further oppressed by her own religious sense."

271,A Separation,9,7 July 2015,A movie to remember,"An absolute feel good movie .I don't know a single word of Arabic yet it conquered my mind.Just like a real life incident taped and screened.All the actors were living in it.Splendid performance from every single artists.I didn't feel much lagging in this movie and even if there is its mandatory for feel good movies.The movie shows the love of a son to his father, a father to his daughter.The climax first made me lost but after thinking about it i felt its the best way to end a movie-keeping the audience guessing and making their own conclusions. Congrats to the whole crew members hoping to see more feel good piece of works like this."
272,A Separation,9,13 May 2015,An exciting thriller disguised as a realistic movie,"I had not idea what to expect when I started watching this movie. The title suggested something like a romantic story, and as the film is Iranian, I thought maybe it was about a forced separation of two lovers because of political reasons? It's quite the opposite. And the fact that it is from Iran gives only a background: This is not an ""exotic"" movie. And it's not romantic at all. At least not in the traditional way. This is a movie about how two people grow apart, how a relationship deteriorates because of the circumstances and communication gives way to misunderstandings, about how hope and a project together turn into disappointment and exasperation. And this is told in a way that makes the film so original and thrilling I'm still thinking about it some days after I watched it. There is a brilliant dialog in the movie that condenses all the drama of a separation: - But you said it wasn't serious. - Well, it became serious. Perfect."
273,A Separation,8,26 March 2015,valuable and noticeable,"I know that I am a single man, however, I realized that this movie is a masterpiece for all lovers of the drama theater. The film has a mysterious atmosphere. And offhand boring that makes you go looking characters and make you understand them.This story has'not the hero.When you feel that a certain character of the story has better performance than the rest of the characters. Suddenly he changes your mind with strange behavior.If this film was made in another country would be better off, but the film is undoubtedly showed the strong potential of Iranian filmmakers in the Field of international cinema"
274,A Separation,9,17 December 2014,Divorce Iranian Style,"This contemporary Iranian movie starts with Simin appealing for a divorce from her husband Nader in front of a judge. Both actors played this scene with such conviction that I found it to be an attention grabber. The scene is cleverly filmed from the point of view of the judge. The upshot is that divorce in Iran must be rare, since the judge denies the appeal for lack of evidence of major mistreatment, like beatings.Being from the United States a good deal of the interest in this for me was to get a glimpse into personal lives in Iran. In spite of the political situation between America and Iran being so fraught I have understood that the Iranian people are for the most part altogether intelligent and reasonable. It was of value to have this movie put a human face on that. Director Farhadi seems to want to downplay international politics, in spite of the opening scene where Simin wants to leave the country for, as she says, a better future for her daughter. There is no mention of the circumstances that have led her to want to leave, and I would really have liked to have heard what she had to say on that. Once the basic premise is established the movie moves on to a family drama where the daughter, Termeh, becomes a pawn in the ongoing disagreement between Simin and Nader. As with most major node points in life, what ensues from conflict is not predictable or expected. There are elements of courtroom drama and thriller here. Samir and Nader appear to be living a comfortable middle class life in a well furnished apartment, their physical circumstances are similar to what a middle class family would have in the United States. Even with the many differences between the culture I am familiar with and what is presented here, I could well understand the actions and motivations of all the characters. Religion plays a an essential role, e.g. the housekeeper consults a religious authority to determine if bathing Nader's senile father would be a sin. Swearing to anything on the Koran would be a serious offense. It was touching to see how much love Nader had for his father, who would probably be placed in a nursing home in the United States. There is one highly emotional scene that has Nader hugging his father at length and crying."
275,A Separation,8,2 December 2014,Slow and touching,"The movie depicts an interesting scenery of struggling modern Iran. The clash between tradition and modernity , between religious and secular.Women's rights are touched in a very delicate way, leaving space for the movie's plot without overwhelming the viewer with Iran social issues that are served in a realistic way. The movie is not the typical ""drama driven film"" in which something happens in every minute but is rather a slow in its development - touching on the characters' personal issues and POVs making the viewer part of the character's happiness or sadness. I loved it!"
276,A Separation,8,12 June 2014,A 2 Hour Long Dramatic Ride,"This is what a real drama is. It's a movie that captures your attention from the get-go. I will admit even though I knew the story was fascinating from the beginning, it does take about 15-20 minutes to finally get started. The drama between families feels so real, and to be honest I really couldn't decide who to root for. I love when movies give you decides to every coin and make it nearly impossible to root for either side. The film deserves all of the many accolades it was getting. It's a movie that will stick with you for a long time. It also makes you really appreciate the peacefulness I have in my life and how one decision can destroy your life.The title tells us the movie involves a separation, but to what extent does this separation really effect them. Well the decision for Simin to leave her husband is about as impactful as a choice as she could make. It caused a ripple effect and in return we could a family-courtroom drama that nearly rips both families apart for good. Once Nader gets accused of murder, the drama really begins. Secrets are kept and uncovered in the next hour as we all try and figure out what really has happened and who is to blame.The film is pretty much a masterpiece because of the incredible screenplay and the impeccable lead performances from the main leads. In particular I thought the daughter and mother shared some of the best scenes and the most impressive performances.+Great Drama +Thought Provoking +Who do I root for? -Bit of a slow start 8.5/10"
277,A Separation,7,15 February 2014,Interesting,"Interesting Iranian drama. Has character depth and the central plot is intriguing. At times you feel true empathy with the characters, no matter what the cultural differences (if any).However, it takes a while to get moving. The first 1/3rd or so of the movie it just seems to drift. You would normally say this is character development, but in this case it just seemed over-indulgent micro- detailing.Once it does get going, it is not overly compelling. The ins and outs of the court case make you feel the writer-director is manipulating you into choosing a certain side, and being quite judgemental in their manipulation. The more this went on, the more disinterested I became, as I felt the writer-director was going to let their own views and prejudices dictate the outcome.This said, the movie resolves itself well. For all the judgemental manipulation, justice is served in the end. The ending may seem odd, but is right for the movie, showing you the true point of the movie.Good performances all round."
278,A Separation,10,11 February 2014,real life?,"It is a fantastic movie. Screenplay is great, all actors play their role fantastic and real. it is a hard situation were we find our people. But does it show the real Iran? No, they show just a problem in a life of a normal couple with real problems. That's great. No music, no stars(after the film they are), just fantastic actors. I loved the settings also. Real and no Hollywood setting. You can feel with the people and understand how hard it must be for them. I love this movie. But it show also a little the marriage situation in Iran. I mean from the law. it must be not easy for them. The love each other and want. But the spiral of their problem will harder for them."
279,A Separation,8,22 January 2014,Stark Depiction of Family Life,"Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and his wife Simin (Leila Hatami) can no longer live together. Simin wants to go abroad, but Nader feels himself unable to follow as he has to look after his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who has Alzheimer's. Daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) stays with Nader, but still wants her parents to be together. Nader hires Razieh to come and look after his house while he (Nader) is out at work, but things do not go according to plan. Razieh loses her unborn child, and her husband Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini) accuses Nader of contributing to the tragedy. The conflicts between the two families - those of Nader and Hojjat - end up in the courts, involving issues not just of justice but religious and social traditions as well. Asghar Farhadi's film is shot in documentary- style, with no musical accompaniment. Its structure can be described as elliptical; the end mirrors the beginning, depicting the difficulties of family life in a society where women have to act according to certain prescribed social and moral guidelines, while their male partners often allow belief in tradition to influence their judgment. Such attitudes are not peculiar to Farhadi's context; they prevail in other territories as well. A SEPARATION is a study in non-communication: both families are articulate, and can express their feelings through well-crafted dialog, but they do not listen to one another. The action unfolds with passionate intensity, sustaining the viewer's attention throughout."
280,A Separation,10,15 January 2014,Master of characters complexity and interconnection,"One of the things I love most about popular non-American films is that these movies are mostly characterized for showing a breakthrough in at least one facet of the cinematography.A Separation is no exception. This one of these very rare movies where you can hardly choose a side. All characters are well structured so there isn't a void in any of their groundings. Hence, after watching the movie what you have is a sensation of how partial and biased one can be. The narrative has a great pace, so you never fall into senseless loops. There's always something being added to the plot, thus the viewer is adding blocks evenly into each character without loosing side of the connections between them.Definitively a must see. I have given more than 8 points to very few movies. I strongly suggest it to watch it and disregard anything that can bias you (name it, foreign film, Iranian film, not in English, etc). enjoy a great plot and a master conception of characters."
281,A Separation,9,10 December 2013,Pride and perjury,"Ashgar Farhadi makes the most beguiling films, grounded in the every day, heavy in dialogue, yet utterly compelling. 'A Separation' begins in the divorce courts; becomes a film more about the difficulties of being a single parent and carer than about the failing of a relationship; then returns to the courts in an unexpected way. The story is universal, yet grounded in the reality of Iranian life, and the notions of Islamic justice. The central (father) figure is a quiet and superficially reasonable man, but utterly proud and self-contained; his wife, who originally appears less sympathetic, actually possesses the social skills to (possibly) save their situation: the gradual transfer of sympathy evoked is one of the film's achievements. The film's second couple, who would be the villains in a Hollywood movie, are sympathetic in their own way even as they become locked in a fierce struggle with the nominal heroes. The ending is both well-judged and sad."
282,A Separation,7,7 December 2013,A Separation,"This Iranian film was one listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I had seen the DVD cover a few times and certainly wondered what it was about, but I didn't know that it was the nominated and won awards in the foreign film category, so I was definitely watching it. Basically middle class Iranian couple Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are on the verge of divorce, despite still loving each other somewhat Simin has exit visa valid for only forty days and he wants to move for a better life with ten year old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), but Nader will not leave his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) who suffering Alzheimer's disease, despite him not knowing who he is most of the time. Simin eventually moves out and goes to live with her parents, Termeh stays with her father in an action to try and bring her per divorcing parents back together, and he meanwhile follows advice from Simin hires a man called Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini) to be his father's carer while during the day he is at work, but Hojjat can't make it on the first day. Instead Hojjat's wife Razieh (Sareh Bayat) is desperate for the money, being mother to infant daughter Somayeh (Kimia Hosseini), and shows up to do the work, a few days pass and she continues in her husband's continued absence, and between her and Nader an incident occurs that could threaten their place in the community. Eventually all adults and children make their decisions as what is the best thing to do for themselves, of course the decisions bring justice, humanity and well-being into consideration as well, the poignant end of the film is the divorce between Nader and Simin being finalised, and Termeh is left alone to decide which parent she wants to live, the parents waiting in the character lasts through the end credits. Also starring Shirin Yazdanbakhsh as Simin's Mother, Kimia Hosseini as Somayeh and Merila Zare'i as Miss Ghahraii. The performances are all fine, I admit I lost my way a little with what was going on between particular characters, but overall I got the gist of the story, it is an interesting take on a domestic situation and how all facets of it will change and affect others in the mix, a watchable drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!"
283,A Separation,8,13 June 2013,"Nader and Simin are not satisfied with your life, and the divorce court but...","Nader and Simin are not satisfied with your life, and the divorce court but also Trmh daughter does not want it.
