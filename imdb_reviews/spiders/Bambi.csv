0,Bambi,8,21 September 2004,A Disney film with a lot of heart,"If you talk to anyone about what film messed them up mentally as a child, Bambi is a guarantee to be in that list. Who hasn't named this film as one of the saddest movies of all time? The funny thing is, this is a children's movie! It's made by Disney! I'm convinced that Disney had to tear us down just so they could build us back up, my goodness, we are Disney Marines! Bambi is one of the training videos to make us tough, because if you can make it through this film without crying that proves that you have no heart and are dead inside. Bambi despite being one of the saddest movies of all time still has a lot of heart and is one of the best in the Disney classics. With it's beautiful animation, charming characters and breathtaking story this is a movie that no one should miss.In a forest thicket, a doe gives birth to a fawn whom she names Bambi. After he learns to walk, Bambi befriends Thumper, a young rabbit; then, while learning to talk, Bambi meets a young skunk whom he calls ""Flower"". After Bambi has completely learned how to talk, his mother takes him to the meadow, a place that is both wonderful and frightening. Bambi's mother warns him that deer are unprotected in the meadow as there are no trees or bushes to hide them, so they must take great care for their own safety. Bambi and his mother go to the meadow and discover a patch of new grass, as they eat, his mother senses a hunter and orders Bambi to flee. As they run, gun shots ring out. When Bambi arrives at their thicket, he discovers his mother is no longer with him. He grows up and learns the way of surviving being an adult deer.I do have one small problem with the film, after the tragic scene where Bambi's father tells him that his mother can no longer be with him indicating that she's dead, you're tearing up painfully and then all of a sudden it cuts to this wonderful magical music with birds and flowers! What kind of a mind screw is that?! ""Be sad, be painfully sad, you are so sad that you want to fill an ocean with your tears of sadnessNOW BE HAPPY"", I just don't get that part. However all that aside, Bambi is still a good Disney film, but it is a hard one to watch. I still think kids are a lot stronger than adults give them credit for, like I said, this movie may be a tear jerker, but it's a wonderful story of friendship and coming of age. Disney doesn't hold back when it comes to delivering a good message, bad things do happen, but we can still be a good person and live life like it was meant too. I recommend Bambi to anyone, it's a good movie with a lot of heart, just have a box of tissues ready when you watch it.8/10"
1,Bambi,10,18 July 1999,The last of its kind,"Walt Disney didn't make another full-length animated film until 1950, by which time his golden age had well and truly passed.  Was `Bambi' a quiet, gentle farewell, then?  If you haven't seen it you could be forgiven for thinking so; and the slightly over-sugared opening scenes might confirm this view.  But prepare to be jolted out of your seat.  The forest contains darkness as well as light.  The gunshots that ring out across the silences are truly alarming (and there are many ways Disney and Hand make them more alarming: consider the scene where a flock of birds are cowering in the grass, until one decides to fly into the air and risk death rather than put up with the suspense).  Also worth noting about `Bambi' is its use of psychological colour.  In at least three key scenes, the colour scheme shifts wildly, not because the sun has set or anything of that kind, but in order to illustrate Bambi's psychological state.  Particularly fine is the scene where he is running away from the clearing in fear and the world turns into just a few pale and dirty shades of yellow.The greatest thing is the way Disney manages to convince us that there is nothing else in the world, outside the forest.  Not once do we see a horizon.  Nor do we sense one.  By some standards not much happens in the forest - a few deaths, a few births, what else is new?  But when the forest is the whole world they matter a good deal."
2,Bambi,9,18 March 2001,Disney's Truest Masterpiece--Man Is In The Forest!,"From the opening scene where the multiplane camera glides through a quiet forest until the stirring forest fire climax, a viewer has to be aware he is watching one of the all-time great films. So much of the cycle of life is covered that it's hard to realize the film is a mere 69 minutes. In a book called 'The Making of Bambi', Ollie Johnston reveals that originally there was much more footage that Disney eventually trimmed, cutting out whole sequences before the film previewed. Obviously, he made a wide decision. There is no extraneous scene here, it moves seamlessly through its cycle of life story with the charming animal creatures carrying the story to its logical conclusion. The background music complements all of the drama and comedy. The storm sequence is the most beautiful blend of music and drawings ever achieved by the Disney artists. The naturally drawn deer are the result of months of careful preparation and study, giving the entire film the feel of a nature study as well as giving the audience great entertainment. The choral work is extremely effective, particularly on songs like 'Love Is A Song' (Oscar nominated), 'I Bring You A Song' and 'Little April Shower'. The impressionistic forest glows with a life of its own and is the real star of the film, thanks to the influence of Japanese artist Tyrus Wong. No wonder this was Disney's favorite film. It will stay fresh and young forever. An awesome achievement!In conclusion, having done some choral work myself as a glee club singer, I especially appreciated the great contribution made by the mixed chorus (male/female) that does such a wonderful job on all of the choruses that blend so seamlessly with the rich background score. Truly exceptional choral vocals conducted by Charles Henderson."
3,Bambi,,5 August 2000,Not at all like its sentimental reputation,"I was staying over at the home of my three-year old niece; after everyone had gone to bed, I found and popped this title in the VCR.   I had only a rough familiarity with the plot (like everyone, I knew Bambi's mother gets killed) and was also aware that ""Bambism"" has been used as describing a overly sentimental love of wildlife.   Oh wow.  I found that while this movie certainly has a heart for its characters, it is not at all sugarcoated about the realities of animal life. Consider the following points it makes:   1) Animals do not live in nuclear families.   Bambi lives with his mother only, his presumptive father is off in the background.   2).  Animals often go hungry in the winter.   3).  Male animals must be prepared to fight rivals as a prelude to mating.   4).  Man (here assisted by canine lackeys) is easily the most dangerous threat creatures face.    Rather than putting a Hollywood gloss on animal life, ""Bambi"" if anything is better than what would be made today.  Remember that the same studio recently put Hercules into a doting nuclear family, the actual circumstances of the hero's birth apparently thought too scandalous for contemporary children to be exposed to (though one presumes ancient Greek children handled them well enough).     Plus when you consider that a large sector of the populace takes a ""humanity couldn't possibly be at fault"" attitude toward the decimation of animal populations, you know that Point 4). above would today be softpedaled if not entirely neutralized by the addition of sympathetic human characters. Look what happened with the otherwise excellent TBS production of ""Animal Farm.""      And the animation!!  The gorgeous, pencil-drawn Impressionistic renditions of the rhythms of the woodlands makes you wonder if modern animators haven't been spoiled by computer graphics.   I'm only sorry I probably won't ever see this film in a theatre, as it was meant to be seen.   As cliche as it may sound, this is a timeless film for all ages.  I cannot praise it highly enough."
4,Bambi,8,24 November 2002,What animation can evoke when it's done just right,"Blissful, playful, moving and inspiring, Walt Disney's ""Bambi"" is a precious jewel that will last longer than most of us will. Indeed, it has a timeless quality, matched with a charming music score and wonderful character voices. Pauline Kael of The New Yorker poked fun at the voice-changes when the infant animals grow up over winter (sort of a puberty-in-the-thicket), but what other way was there to show the passage of time and how it changes everything, even the woodland creatures we take for granted? It's an amazing achievement. The song score never elicited a hit the size of, say, ""When You Wish Upon a Star"", but it does feature the sprightly ""Little April Showers"", which underscores the very best sequence. ***1/2 from ****"
5,Bambi,10,22 September 2000,Excellent Disney classic,"This is one awesome animated movie. If there are people out there who don't love this movie, they either have hearts of stone or bricks for brains. This is a simple, charming and heartwarming tale of innocence and the joys of youth. It doesn't need slam bang violent action or hokey bad humor. This movie, instead, flows naturally. The songs are also great, not the big, overblown affairs that modern Disney likes to do nowadays. They are charming, well sung and well scored, and more than one is about love. The movie itself seems to glow with a light so pure, it's almost angelic. The characters are also great. Bambi, Thumper, and Flower are adorable and well developed characters. The things they do and say will melt your heart. And not a stupid sidekick in sight. While this movie might not be as popular or as grand as Snow White or Pinocchio, grandness isn't usually such a good thing. Both of those movies don't have quite Bambi's charm or innocence, and both stop just short of being rather sadistic, Snow White especially. This is my second favorite animated movie, with only The Fox and the Hound topping it in my heart. I recommend Bambi to any Disney lover. They don't make them like this anymore. This is a perfect family movie. Modern Disney can never touch this. 10/10"
6,Bambi,10,3 January 2003,A classic that will never be forgotten,"BAMBIA Helpless little deer is born by the name of Bambi. He is born among the forest to a grateful Mother. Bambi meets some animal friends for himself, A rabbit named Thumper and a skunk named Flower. Bambi falls in love while he grows up along side his friends. The troubles of the wild life strike when a hunter kills Bambi's mother.The troubles of the emotional for every animal in the forest. A beautiful ending concludes this masterpiece.This Disney movie has been passed from from one generation at a time. ""Bambi"" captures your heart and it's one of those movies you can't wait for your own children to see, and then they pass it down to their children and so on. ""Bambi"" is one of Disney's best and an American treasure.
I give it ***** stars out of *****."
7,Bambi,10,9 March 2012,A Timeless Masterpice ...,"Hard to believe that ""Bambi"" is already 70 years old and yet no other pieces of animation ever came close to it. You can mention ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"", any Disney's acclaimed masterpiece, still, nothing can beat the good old animation drawn by hand and on that level, watching ""Bambi"" is like admiring the 'Mona Lisa' of Animation. The American Film Institute recognized ""Bambi"" as number three in its Top Ten Animated films right after ""Pinocchio"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". I guess, the pioneer deserved the top spot if only because without ""Snow White"", there wouldn't have been ""Bambi"".And the progresses made between the two films are tremendous; look closer to the animal designs, in the former they look like animated creatures from short cartoons, while ""Bambi"" doesn't focus only on aesthetics but also on scientific exactitude. The film doesn't forget to be simply Animation, but the realism of the landscape, the drawing, everything makes it hard to believe that it was made only five years after ""Snow White"". ""Bambi"" is a tribute for the inspiring level of perfectionism that elevated its animated movies at the same level of Hollywood's greatest masterpieces, it's a tribute to Disney's ambitions as a true film-maker, as he never took anything for granted. Every successful film was an encouragement for making a better one and after ""Bambi"", it was naturally impossible to make something better. It's not surprising that the film closes what we refer now as Disney's Golden Age.I don't want to make ""Bambi"" sound only like a technical achievement, after all, even as a kid, my eyes and my heart were grabbed by the story. But now, as a grown-up, more familiar with today's animated films, I see ""Bambi"" with constant marveled eyes, I can turn off the sound and never cease to be amazed by how it look, or I could close my eyes and simply let myself transported by the music. ""Bambi"" would never work today, because animated films are marketed for a different audience, eager to see fast-paced action, hilarious sidekicks, lager- than-life villains and catchy songs. These are the must of Animated films and it's interesting to note that ""Bambi"" handle these elements with a sober maturity that would put most kids to sleep now. I can't believe I'm saying this, me who is 40 years younger than the film. ""Bambi"" was made in a time where people had a reason to see movies that was beyond the idea of entertainment. Audiences wanted to be transported in another dimension and to be emotionally engaged, their eyes marveled by a dreamlike world that transcends the banality of their life. Just look at the beginning of ""Bambi"", certainly the most haunting of all Disney overtures. From the first frames, it feels like a camera is filming a forest, it's a long traveling shot in a foggy, misty, dark setting we would never leave until the end. The audience is respectfully invited to penetrate the world of Bambi, quietly discreetly, until the first animals wake up to see the New Prince, then we follow them with excitement. ""Bambi""'s opening sequence echoes the beginning of ""The Lion King"" in a much more intimate way, and when we discover the newborn Bambi sleeping beneath his Mother, we share the same impression than the animals.In many ways, ""Bambi"" reminds of ""The Lion King"" and vice versa, but while ""The Lion King"" was a sort of Disney take on typical Shakespearian themes, ""Bambi"" doesn't embarrass itself with a specific plot, but for me, what has often been pointed out as a flaw happens to be the film's most defining force. ""Bambi"" doesn't tell a story because ""Bambi""s main protagonist is not Bambi, but Time, Time is as present as Man although both can't be seen, and the whole film consist for us to witness the passing of time in Bambi's. Bambi is the central character but not the core of the film, which helped to deal with a story without needing pointless foils. His best friends, Thumper and Flower are real friends not supporting sidekicks. ""Bambi"" is a movie about time, inviting us to contemplate time's effect on animals, nature. The way each season is portrayed through music and colors is simply magical.And ""Bambi"" ends just like it started, it's indeed the 'circle of life' with a scope so large that we can't even talk of a coming-of-age story: from the beginning, Bambi learns how to walk, to talk, he discovers this strange feeling we call love. And the toughest lesson the Prince of the Forest had to face is the one forever engraved in the traumatized minds of generations of children and adults. ""Bambi"" doesn't have a plot, which makes every piece of action absolutely powerful. After the first entrance of Man that interrupted the deer's ballet, there is one 'bang' that warns us about his presence. And when the Mother, who tutored Bambi for the two thirds of the film, feels Man's presence, she immediately covers her son by running behind him. The last shot of Bambi jumping followed by the fatal sound is one of the most brutal, shocking and admirably powerful displays of violence in a film, and the sadness that comes after the beautiful sacrifice is impossible to describe.This is the most disturbing death in a Disney film, and probably in any film, a necessary pivotal device in 'coming-of-age' stories but never equaled with this intensity. Disney created a villain even scarier because he was off-screen and his presence only identifiable with an ominous theme, doesn't that ring a bell to you, cinematic fans? Well, I guess no one can review ""Bambi"" without evoking the most characteristic and memorable part of the film, but needless to say that ""Bambi"" is more than that, a unique experience to be enjoyed because there would never be another film like it..."
8,Bambi,10,6 September 2013,The last film of Disney's Golden Age,"Bambi (1942) is often sneered at by contemporary film goers my age. In their minds, outside of the death of Bambi's mother, the film is a cutesy little joy ride about a happy little deer and his happy little forest friends frolicking about grassy meadows. They also find it much too slow and lacking in plot for their interests, instead switching on the film's spiritual successor The Lion King (1994), which most of my generation holds up as the greatest animated film of all time.No offense to The Lion King, but it doesn't even come close to touching the greatness of Bambi. Outside of a few whimsical moments, this is a dark film about the cycle of death and life. It's more of a meditative piece than a traditional narrative, which will not appeal to those who absolutely require a detailed plot. The animation and backgrounds are breathtaking. Like the other early Disney features, there's strong traces of German expressionism in there (ex. the fight between Bambi and a rival deer is mostly shown in silhouette and violent colors, Bambi and Faline's dreamlike run through the meadow, etc.).The atmosphere is not as cutesy as people recall. There is an undercurrent of dread to the whole thing, a sense of danger. As beautiful and enchanting as the forest can be, it is also dangerous. The way man is handled in the film is surprisingly mature: instead of putting the main characters against a laughable caricature, mankind's presence is unseen and feels more like a natural disaster than a living entity. In fact, Bambi might be one of the most adult films in the Disney animated canon. Ignore its saccharine reputation and give it another look."
9,Bambi,10,22 September 2000,An enduring classic,Bambi is one of Disney's greatest...About the life of a young newborn deer and the triumphs and tragedies it endures from birth until adulthood..Quintessential Disney that is a must see..Released in 1942 so there are some WW 2 metaphors if you read between the lines  (or it may just be me) One of the greatest family films of all time..on a scale of one to ten...10
10,Bambi,8,4 May 2006,Unique Animation That Still Looks Great,"The watercolor-type animation in here is tough to beat, even almost 65 years after it was made. It still looks good, very good. I don't know if this kind of artwork was ever duplicated so the film is worth owning for that alone.The story is as simple: a deer's life, from birth to experiencing life in the forest and then having a fawn of his own. He has two cute friends: ""Thumper"" the rabbit and ""Flower,"" the squirrel. Liberal critics all love this film because it had a strong anti-hunting message Even though they are never shown, the hunters kill the nice animals and set fire to the forest! However, to be fair, they don't dwell on this. Overall, it's a positive film with the usual happy ending."
11,Bambi,,10 March 2005,"Appealing, Thoughtful Animated Classic","The characters and story from Walt Disney's adaptation of ""Bambi"" still hold up as well as they ever did. The animation, likewise, still looks very attractive and detailed. It's understandable if the animation in itself doesn't strike everyone now as being particularly impressive, given the many recent achievements in animation, but in itself it is an excellent job with the resources of its time. It all makes for an appealing and thoughtful classic that is still well worth seeing.The main characters are well-chosen, especially Bambi himself and the always-engaging Thumper. Some of the best scenes are simply those of the various animal friends playing together  the scene of Thumper and Bambi on the ice being perhaps the most endearing of all. The change of seasons is used to great effect, both aesthetically and in advancing the story and its themes.It's pretty interesting to contrast ""Bambi"" with ""The Lion King"", by no means to decide which is 'better', but rather to take note of the slightly different ways in which they handle some very similar material. Both present the story of a young animal 'prince', the way he explores and learns about his world, and the ways that he must adjust to the tragedies and challenges of adulthood. There are also a number of other interesting similarities. Bambi is at once the more innocent, yet also the more somber of the two.One very interesting difference is that the greatest threats in ""Bambi"" come from humans, who are wholly external to the world of the characters, and over whose actions the animals have no control, whereas in ""The Lion King"" the threats and conflicts are all amongst the animal characters themselves. Both movies deserve to be ranked among the very best animated features of their eras, so there's no need to prefer one over the other  it can just make for even more interesting viewing to notice how these differences help to give each of the two movies its distinctive character.""Bambi"" is the kind of movie that can stick in your mind for many years, especially if you first saw it when young. The characters and many of their adventures make it very appealing, often even adorable, and yet it also portrays some of the most serious (and frightening) things that can happen in the lives of the young. It's a fine movie that accomplishes a lot, and it has held up quite well over the years."
12,Bambi,7,20 August 2007,Bambi - the real Disney treasure,"As a kid I was a huge fan of ""Bambi"" because of it's sincere and simple story, it's great nature settings and it's lovable characters. I still enjoy this movie now as an adult. The animation is absolutely stunning, especially the forest. The characters are lovable (especially Thumper) and Bambi is a simple character that you really can relate to. The score is great. The songs may not be Disney's most memorable tunes, but I liked the song in the rain sequence, ""Little April Shower"". Although the story is quite simple, it's still a story that everybody can relate to, with romance, humor, sadness (although I didn't cried) and good excitement. But the ending is a little bit sentimental, so that's why this movie doesn't get a higher vote from me. But still, ""Bambi"" certainly is a Disney classic in my eyes."
13,Bambi,10,26 August 2016,Observational and thoughtful,"When Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released back in 1937, Walt Disney proved not only that there was vast commercial potential in animation, but that it was also a credible art-form. Disney, the great innovator, toyed with surrealism in Pinocchio and created a sublime blend of music, dance and visual splendour in Fantasia, both released in 1940. With Bambi, Disney observed the quiet balance of the natural world and the troubling emergence of man. While it may contain an ensemble of cutesy talking animals with kids' voices and scenes that will have you saying ""awww!"" out loud, Bambi is pretty heavy stuff at times.We begin with the birth of a young prince, the wide-eyed, white- tailed deer Bambi (Donnie Dunagan), and while this opening may ring a bell with anyone who has seen The Lion King (1994) - which is everybody - Bambi is not near-mythical royalty with a destiny laid out for him. He is viewed with extreme curiosity by the other woodland animals, including enthusiastic young rabbit Thumper (Peter Behn), and they giggle as they watch the awkward deer try to stand up. As his protective mother teaches him of the dangers of the forest, his new friends teach him how to leap over fallen trees and ice-skate. Bambi doesn't so much have a plot with a beginning, a middle and an end. Instead, it's simply a portrayal of life, and the discovery, learning and danger we all come to face.The seasons change along with the film's tone and Bambi's increasing maturity, and the colder it gets, the closer you get to that scene. A few near-misses practically confirm that the doting mother isn't going to be around for long, but the moment still packs a punch even on repeat viewings. Brutally, the incident happens off-camera, and Bambi is informed of her death matter-of-factly by his stoic father. It's an incredibly brave and creative approach, and one that deals with the harshness of real life with incredible maturity. It also sums up Bambi perfectly - observational, unpatronising and thoughtful - but it will certainly warm your heart as well. Disney is frequently criticised for sugar-coating and over-simplifying our world, but I would point anyone in the direction of the corporation's earlier works, particularly Bambi, for elevating animation to a cinematic art-form."
14,Bambi,8,7 August 2013,One of Disney's greatest animated classics,"Bambi is a remarkable film that captures the innocence and beauty of life, its challenges as we get older and nature being disrupted and damaged by ""Man."" Bambi is one of the shortest feature films ever but what it lacks in length it makes up for in depth. The animation in this film is extraordinary every setting looks like oil pastels on canvas as we see the wonder of nature with its waterfalls, trees and beauty of animals and plants during the various changes in nature.Bambi is born in Spring a time of rebirth and beauty as leaves come return, flowers bloom and the world awakens from winter's cold grip. We see Bambi struggle to walk as he always falls down and as he tries to talk which are extremely humorous and give him the characteristics of a baby. We see his friends Thumper and Flower interact and have fun w/ Bambi and their innocence also builds up their happiness and bliss as their like young kids wandering around in the beauty of spring and the forest around them which protects them from harm. The dynamic Bambi and his mother share are poignant also as we see her nurture and instruct her son on how to act, walk and be around other animals and the love they exude for each other is also a shining staple of maternal love which again gives us a genuine attachment to this story .However, as Bambi grows his mother takes him to the meadow where we 1st observe the threat of ""man."" His mom warns him not to rush onto the meadow and soon we 1st hear ""Man"" coming as the colors in the scene suddenly shift from light to dark as the forest are suddenly being overwhelmed by fear and chaos. Man's theme is a haunting piece of music that can only be matched with its power and intensity by Bernard Herrman's extraordinary score in Psycho and Carpenter's Halloween. Both movies capture horror because we don't know who is behind the actions in the film and why they're happening. By not showing ""man"" the viewer is terrified cause man's identity is unknown and they kill and torture animals for no apparent reason.As we move to Winter, the animation is gorgeous particularly the scene of Bambi and Thumper on ice. The wonder of this scene is the use of snow which is striking much like the thunderstorm sequence in how nature can be so beautiful and dangerous at the same time at different times. It's also ironic that in winter, as Bambi and his mother are out grazing at grass that man's theme comes and as his mother realizes what's going on she orders Bambi to the thicket. He makes it but as we discover she doesn't murdered by ""man"".While this scene is tragic and sad, it's a bit over-hyped as the ""most tragic moment in film."" The fact that this was the 1st time Disney showed us a realistic moment in life when someone dies and nothing can alter this and that it occurred just as winter was ending perhaps gives this scene the tragic feel and notoriety it's gotten over the years. The fact that Bambi's mom ran behind him intentionally so to shield her son from harm is the true heartbreak of this scene : Sacrificing your own life so your child can have a future.As Spring comes again, we see Bambi ,Thumper and Flower as adults terrified of falling into ""twitterpating"" or love as owl describes it. Sure enough they all do and in Bambi's case its with faline the doe he met in the meadow as a child. We soon see the spring breeze of petals and song cascade as Bambi and Faline fall in love and Spring again gives birth to something love and beauty. But as the warmth continues, Man appears again with their campfire and Bambi is warned by the prince of the forest that man is back in greater numbers. Here man's theme becomes so unnerving as the sound grows louder and louder as the animals flee into the forest and it's as though we hear the footsteps of man creeping in to kill anything in their path. The gunshots come and once more the color scheme changes as nature is being killed and hurt by ""man. The fire which may have been intentionally set by man wipes out the forest and nearly Bambi and his father who barely escape along with other animals in the forest. At the end, Spring returns and bliss and happiness return as leaves and trees are growing back, and a new generation is coming to see Faline give birth to 2 new fawns . Bambi isn't a perfect film and its flaws are somewhat stark especially how Bambi becomes and adult full of bliss only months after his mom dies. This simply makes no sense and for me damaged my connection to these characters and kills the film, until it picks up when man returns to the woods. Also the scene where Bambi and the other deer fight over Faline while dramatic, is odd because we have no background to who he is(Bambi 2 explains this.) Also after her death, Bambi's mom is never mentioned again which is odd cause Bambi seems to have no issues dealing with her demise. It's a shame cause up to the death of his mom, Bambi is a perfect film and these flaws make this a very good, but not GREAT film.However, this is a shockingly simple moving and poignant film of human innocence, growing up, sacrifice and the horror of people who'll murder and destroy nature and humanity out of greed or sport. If someone ever asked me to see a film that captured the fear of how ""man"" is corrupting the world around us, Bambi would be my unanimous choice."
15,Bambi,10,4 August 2013,"For its outstanding music, animation, characters, and storytelling, ""Bambi"" is arguably Walt Disney's crowning achievement","Whenever I go on a hike or take a walk in any national parks or any forest areas, there are only two things that I think about. The first thing I think about is absorbing the beautiful scenery surrounding me, whether it's with the various amount of trees, or with the cool and cleansing waterfalls, creeks and bodies of water that I encounter. The second thing I think about is if whether or not I'll come across any friendly forest animals along the way and maybe even feed them any food I couldn't eat. I guess you could say that I'm into the outdoors. One film that has contributed significantly to my love of the outdoors would have to be Walt Disney's 5th full-length animated feature, ""Bambi"" (1942), arguably the finest accomplishment of Walt Disney's career which has already seen many impressive achievements. The film begins with the birth of a fawn named Bambi who will one day become the Great Prince of the Forest just like his father and protect the other forest creatures from any trespassers. In the meantime, he figures out how to walk and talk and learn more about the world around him. During his childhood, he forms a close bond with his mother and makes many lifelong friends along the way. Among the friends he makes are an energetic rabbit named Thumper, a friendly skunk named Flower, and a female fawn named Faline, who eventually becomes Bambi's future mate. This film essentially tracks his life from birth to adulthood when he starts to assume his duties as Prince of the Forest. When talking about what makes ""Bambi"" a colossal movie going experience, the first thing I would talk about would be the musical score by Frank Churchill and Edward Plumb. I can say without any doubt in my mind that it is one of the best musical scores I have ever heard in any American motion picture I've seen in my entire life. It easily qualifies in my top five favorite film scores of all time I love it that much. Aside from contributing so much to the atmosphere of the forest in this film, the musical score adds a tremendous amount of emotion to the narrative due in large part to the heavenly choir. Whenever I hear that choir, I automatically feel better it's so soothing and healing. Say what you will about the songs not being household names. When the opening song ""Love is a Song"" plays during the opening credits, my spirits couldn't be raised any higher. The animation and backgrounds in ""Bambi"" are some of the studio's best. Walt Disney and his talented staff of animators took special care and effort into the drawing of the animals for this film. They had to study real-life animals and do the best that they could at capturing the realism of their movements, behavior and personalities. The end results are so superb that even the more unrealistic stuff such as ice skating seems credible in its realism. Much like the film's music, the visuals here are so well drawn out and detailed that you feel like you're in the forest throughout the duration of the picture. Remember the shot where Bambi is looking into a stream during the autumn and leaves are falling into the stream and making growing circles? That was a beautiful shot, and luckily for us, there are more shots like that which have similar beauty to them. Because the passion is so strong and present in both the music and animation, it's hard not to be thankful for the devoted artistry that was put into every scene. Along with the strong visuals and music, another reason I think ""Bambi"" holds up very well today is because of the characters. Even though the characters are talking animals, they're all very likable and worth caring for. I love how curious Bambi is about his surroundings. I enjoy how Thumper speaks before he thinks (""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all""). I was highly amused by how cynical and optimistic Friend Owl was both at the same time. I was also very touched by the strong bond between Bambi and his mom and the meaningful relationship they shared with each other. By the time the picture's most famous scene comes around (which was known to ruin many childhoods, so I won't delve deeper into it), whatever tears are shed are all warranted because that's how special these characters are even if we're only 45 minutes in. I also love how the writers handled the film's influential message of how much man's presence can affect the wildlife. They made the wise decision of not making it overly preachy on how much turmoil man is causing to these animals. Instead, the writers simply track the lives of these animals and the biggest events that occur in each of their lives in a non-conventional way. By making this narrative choice, we're able to love the characters as much as we do and be more involved in the nonlinear and direct narrative. Most importantly, we're able to obtain the message about respecting the wildlife better because we're enjoying how happy these creature's lives can be as opposed to being given a guilt trip about humanity's past mistakes. With ""Bambi"", Walt Disney proves once again that he's a master at storytelling. He keeps the stories simple, entertaining and straight to the point as great storytellers should. There's no way to avoid the subject matter that the most famous scene of this film tackles. But if it's handled as well as it is here, then it's all the more reason to appreciate films like this even more. ""Bambi"" is unpredictable, unforgettable, well-drawn, well written, and well-orchestrated. It also remains the greatest film that Walt Disney had ever produced and remains one of my all-time personal favorites."
16,Bambi,10,16 July 2007,Walt's crowning achievement,"You'd have to have a heart of stone not to fall for Bambi. For me, it's Walt's crowning achievement, and when I watch it today, it still gives the same feeling of nostalgia as it did when I was six years old. In fact, I find even more thought-provoking than I did when I was a child.But what is it that makes Bambi stand out for me? There's magic here alright, but not the fairy magic like in so many other Disney films. There's humans, but they never appear on screen. I think that I was captivated by the way the musicians, the animators and the artwork all become synchronised, like the natural sounds of a real forest. What makes Bambi so wonderful is the feel of being so close to nature. During the scene where it starts to rain, we see Bambi's fascination with the little raindrops. As each little drop lands softly on something, we hear a little note from the orchestra. It is just so well synchronised, and it shows just how much love and dedication was put into it.Also, Bambi flawlessly flips from mood to mood. We watch a scene that is sad, dark and melancholy. It all fades to black, and we are greeted with something light hearted, colourful and joyful. In many other films, something like that would stick out like a sore thumb, but somehow, in an almost magic way, that does not happen with Bambi.What really annoys me is when I see people bash Bambi and call it 'anti-hunting pro-PETA trash.' I'm sure that when dear old Walt made this, he had nothing of the sort in mind. It also annoys me when I see people making a big deal out of one of the most touching and heartbreaking scenes in Bambi. (you know the one I'm talking about!) Sure, it's a poignant scene, but it is also only one tiny fraction of the actual film. So why must people take the Mick out of it, if there is no Mick to take? (That doesn't sound right!)If you are fed up of the huge amount of CGI that's lost its novelty years ago, then pick up a two disc Special Edition DVD of this lovable classic, before Disney locks it up again."
17,Bambi,7,14 February 1999,Why can't they make more of these?,"I will not comment on the plot or the philosophical aspects of this movie - I will simply ask this: Why can't they make more of these?It is very beautifully drawn. No attempts to make fire or water or panoramas look real. They are simply drawn in that beautiful pencil characterizing the entire movie. No happy songs or foolish games. Just a life-cycle portrayed in it's blinding realism.Look, the water is stiff!"
18,Bambi,10,2 May 2016,Best classic Disney in my opinion!,"Bambi is simply amazing , fun , beautiful and inspiring , it was surely a film that marked my childhood and even today admire , the soundtrack is incredible and unique , the characters are very charismatic , and especially the own protagonist is too cute , enchants anyone, even being a cute movie , it has its serious and extremely sad parts , also has romantic parts that are very pleasant , Bambi matures over the film along with the other characters , I love with all my heart all of them, this film for me has no defect , Bambi is charming, exciting and fun , any child would love this movie that deserves to continue passing from generation to generation , a work of art like this deserves to never be forgotten"
19,Bambi,8,22 September 2014,A powerful classic,"Disney wasn't doing strong business in the early 1940's. Films like Pinocchio and Fantasia had cost the company a lot of money due to the unavailability of the European market because of the ongoing World War II. The budget for Bambi wasn't as large as it had been for Pinocchio, but Bambi also didn't do well in the box office upon its release in 1942. Although Pinocchio received a lot of praise from critics at the time, Bambi wasn't received well. Critics noted that Bambi didn't feature enough fantasy elements, which was something Disney films were most known for. The film also wasn't received well amongst hunters. Raymond Brown, editor for the magazine 'Outdoor Life' stated in a 1942 edition of the magazine that Bambi was the worst insult ever offered to American sportsmen, due to the portrayal of 'men' as the villain in Bambi. Does that mean that the 5th Disney full-length animated feature is a bad film? Absolutely not!Bambi is based on the book 'Bambi, A life in the woods' by Felix Salten. The film starts with the birth of Bambi, the prince of the forest. Bambi meets some new friends like Thumper and Flower. Thumper is a bit of a rebellious character who attempts to learn Bambi how to make as much fun as possible. The film focuses a lot on the changing of the seasons. Bambi's born in the spring. In the summer, Bambi's mother takes Bambi to the meadow for the first time. Bambi isn't aware of the dangers that await him there, as his mother warns him to always be careful. Bambi is introduced to a female deer named Faline. He encounters his father, the great prince of the forest. The great prince discovers that the hunters have come into the meadow. The deer flee back into the forest. By the time winter arrives, Thumper attempts to learn Bambi how to ice-skate, although without much success. The food for the deer starts to become scarce, as a hungry Bambi asks his mother why winter seems to last so long. When the first grass pops out from under the snow, his mother takes Bambi to the meadow to eat some of the new spring grass. However, men arrives in the meadow again and while Bambi keeps on running back to the forest, he's unaware that his mother has been shot. His father meets him and tells Bambi his mother will not return. By the time Bambi returns, it's spring again, although it's unclear how much time has passed since the last scene. He's now an adolescent and meets his friends again. They eventually all fall in love. Bambi, of course, falls in love with Faline. Men shows up again and they set some parts of the forest on fire. Bambi has to escape, but he wants to find Faline first. He gets attacked by a pack of hounds. His father ultimately manages to save him and tells Bambi he must get up and so he does. The film ends with Faline giving birth to twins as Bambi takes his father's place as the great prince of the forest.Bambi is one of the most realistic features in the Walt Disney collection. The portrayal of the forest animals seems to be very realistic. That's probably because Disney's team observed wild animals to get an accurate idea of how they live their lives. That's exactly what a lot of critics disliked about Bambi. They found it too realistic without enough fantasy in it. I disagree with them. The simplicity of the story and the realistic imagery is exactly where Bambi's strength lies. Bambi is quite dark compared to the earlier Disney classics. Everybody knows the infamous scene where Bambi's mother gets shot. It is a powerful scene and something you usually don't see in a Disney film. Well, you don't really see it, but you know it when it happens. Men is the villain in Bambi and that's also very unique and strikes a chord with reality, because to these animals, the hunters do form a big threat. The characters are simplistic yet very likable, the songs are really good and story works really well. Bambi might not be the best film produced by Disney, but there's no doubt it's one of animations finest."
20,Bambi,8,23 February 2007,"My third favourite Disney classic - a gorgeous, heart-warming story! :)","This film is receiving a lot of bad reviews on this website. WHY? ""The cover will gather dust"" indeed! Not while I'm around!Anyway, this famous and popular film is about a little fawn/calf (young red deer are called calves and he might be a red deer) called Bambi, who is learning to live in the forest with his mother and two main friends to play with, Thumper and Flower. Also, Bambi is not just any fawn/calf. He's the young prince! Will he manage to take his rightful place as great prince of the forest?I love and have loved this film for about 90% of my life. It is a beautiful classic, has stunning animation, a good story and I love all of the characters, except for the baddie dogs at the end. They are the only baddies you see on screen - and I like that.So if you haven't watched this classic, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING THEN? Watch it, you're guaranteed to love it! :) ;) :()"
21,Bambi,9,8 December 2013,Life In The Forest,"Walt Disney's classic animated film about a young deer named Bambi, the prince of the forest, who tries to find his legs(and place) in the forest with the help of his friends Thumper(a rabbit), and Flower(a skunk) and of course their female counterparts to be enchanted by. Seasons come and go, while Bambi and his friends grow up, though a group of careless(and faceless) hunters intrude on their idyllic life, ending the life of Bambi's mother, and forcing his busy father(the king) to teach his son the proper ways of the forest, and how to deal with humans... Beautifully animated film filled with unforgettable characters and music, and a timeless pro-nature message make this the finest animated film ever made."
22,Bambi,9,1 September 2015,A Child's Introduction to Death.,"Bambi (1942): Dir: David Hand / Voices: Bobby Stewart, Stan Alexander, Cammie King, Peter Behn, Paula Winslowe: Symbolic Disney animation about a fawn named Bambi born to discover everything new and interesting in the world around him. His friends include a rabbit named Thumper and a skunk named Flower and all is fun and games until the reality of adulthood set in. Intriguing social commentary symbolizing the risks of raising children. Forest fires indicate carelessness, and hunters represent uncertainty of death as with Bambi's mother. Sexuality merges when Bambi battles a stag for a mate. Directed by David Hand who previously made the first Disney animation Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Here he provides a greater achievement with harsh realism. Voice talents include Bobby Stewart as Bambi while Stan Alexander voices Flower, and Peter Behn voices Thumper. Cammie King provides the voice of Bambi's future mate Faline. Paula Winslowe provides the pivotal role of Bambi's mother whose fate is long past being a plot spoiler. It is a teaching tool but not for the intended audience. Parents may wish to view this film with their children since its adult themes are solid. It regards growth and adulthood and the unpredictable future. It is also about youth and adulthood with hints of romance. Top notch animation whisking viewers into the carefree forest of untold dangers. Score: 9 / 10"
23,Bambi,8,12 September 2008,A love story,"People frequently say that the death of Bambi's mother is the scene most people cry in. You would have to be to be incredibly shallow and insensitive not to cry. Its a pretty good test of a person and I am so pleased that all these years later I still blubbered like a baby. Bambi looks wonderful and time has treated Walt's favourite film very well.Visually the movie is stunning. All the more remarkable in that it was made in 1942. The scenes of the animals in the meadow enjoying the airy freedom away from the safety of the forest lifts your spirits; it is just beauitiful. The music is brilliant and that rain drop song with the beautiful visuals is a glorious moment in film making. Indeed all the music is wondrous; the score for the fire is rich and exciting. The characters are wonderful. I love the much malinged American skunk, a truly remarkable little creature.I love Flower but Thumper is worthy of the recognition he has got over the years as one of Walt's greatest creations. There are so many wonderful scenes in the film. I love the raindrop scene, the parade and introduction of the stags. Bambi's father is a great creation, almost spiritual. The movie never speaks down to children and the final scene as Bambi's dad disappears is so gracious and beautiful. I love the images in the courting of Bambi and his girl friend. Bambi is a love story and its impossible not to be touched by this magical story. It has always struck me as odd how any one could kill or shoot wild animals and call it sport. Such people are obviously mentally unstable and certainly uncivilised. I dream of a day that recreational hunters get what they deserve. They are the most unworthy people on the planet.Bambi is a lesson in life and its a film that will live for ever as a masterful example of great animation. I really prefer it to the Pixar of today."
24,Bambi,10,25 February 2009,A real tearjerker!,"Bambi is short, but I don't care, because so was Dumbo, which is also very sad but beautiful, however I have always preferred Bambi despite the fact I could really empathise with Dumbo. Bambi is a gem, and overshadowed slightly by the flawless Beauty and the Beast and the stunning Lion King. This classic is right up there with the greats, and was coincidentally Walt Disney's personal favourite. The animation is unparallelled. Those shots of the forest at the beginning were just extraordinary, and it was so colourful and stylised. Another plus was the orchestral score which was so beautiful, that alone reduced me to tears. It matched the animation beautifully, which seldom happens in animation. The characters were both funny and touching, and the story simple and timeless. I laughed so much at Thumper, when he was teaching Bambi to speak. Bambi was great to watch too and so adorable, and I was among the majority who cried when his mother died, because this film was so educational thanks to her. The animals as adolescents aren't quite as appealing as when they were children, but Bambi and Faline's romance was one of the character highlights. The best aspect for me, was that they made the enemy so mysterious. We hear about them, and see what they do, but we don't see them face to face. That is what made the characters so appealing to the audience. This is one of the few films, where you care for everybody you are introduced to. In conclusion, a funny and ever-touching underrated classic. 10/10. Bethany Cox"
25,Bambi,10,13 December 2007,A timeless classic,"The simple story, and beautifully rendered backgrounds of the forest combine to make Bambi a memorable feature. I was surprised by the realism of the drawings and the unsentimental view of nature as often a harsh and unforgiving thing. There was humor, but no overwhelming cuteness; instead, the interactions of the young animals was just like children playing together.The voice talent was excellent and the whole effect was to create a moving and timeless story. It seems clear that The Lion King was drawing heavily on this film for inspiration.I never expected to be as impressed by this movie. I saw it for the first time recently at the age of 54, and now realize why it has always had such impact on viewers. Highly recommended."
26,Bambi,10,3 January 2007,I love this movie .,"I liked a lot this movie ,since I was a kid . Some of my friends are biased about Disney 's movies as this ,because they consider them corny .But I don't agree , this is a work of art ,full of details and with beautiful designs .Every frame have a exquisite work on it . The voices are adequate , the same for the music . The story is very cute and with lots of heart ,but like many movies of Disney it have his dark side ( i said it as a compliment) Even that ,is still a wonderful movie for kids of all the ages ( and kids at heart ) Now ,the modern cartoons are pretty ugly and poorly made . Well ,some are good ,but this movie is still a masterpiece ."
27,Bambi,8,25 January 2006,One of the most lovely stories ever,"'Bambi'is a sweet story made by Disney!The story starts when baby Bambi is introduced by his mother to the other animals of the forest,who comes to see the young prince. The time passes a little, and the young Bambi makes friendship with Flower(the skunk) and Thumper ( the rabbit).One day, when Bambi and his mother are walking, Bambi's mother foresee danger, and she dies in order to protect Bambi from the hunters.(humans) This is one of the saddest scenes I already watch in Disney's movies together when Mufasa dies in ''Lion King''. The other deer comes to help and protects Bambi, and also take good care of him( The Great Prince of the Forest, if I remember correctly he is also Bambi's father). Times passes and Bambi and his friends are all adults and also falling in love. But the Hunters are back, and now Bambi needs to show the same courage of his mother and father in order to protect who he loves."
28,Bambi,10,22 October 2007,No wonder this was Walt Dinsey's favourite movie!,"""Bambi"" is a very sweet little film with an excellent mixture of drama, comedy and suspense. The song at the very beginning of the movie ""Love is a song"" is just beautiful and I think it should of won the Oscar it was nominated for. The animation is just stunning and makes ""Pinnochio"" and ""Snow White"" look like they have skewif animation. Quite possibly THE most funniest part of ""Bambi"" is when Bambi, Thumper and Flower quickly fall in love with their female counterparts, while the most saddest is when Bambi's mother is shot and killed and poor Bambi is left wandering in the blizzard looking for her when he runs into his father. So in short ""Bambi"" is a great film and it's not hard to see why it was Walt Disney's favourite movie."
29,Bambi,10,29 October 2012,Great classic!,"Even though I am 39 years old, I can still watched this Walt Disney Classic as if for the first time, because every time I watch it, I see something new!If you like animals, you will see your share in this one. From deer and rabbits to skunks and chipmunks, they are here! Besides Bambi, my favorite characters are Thumper and Flower. I love Thumper's ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.""My favorite scene in the movie is ""Twitterpated."" I especially love Bambi's moment...so cute and sort of the way I imagine some romances to start...boys's backing away and have to be kissed before they realize what love is...The scenes and situations are so innocent, even a three year old could watch them. Of course there are a couple scenes that are pretty sad - characters die...but that's real life. Things die and they stay dead...I think that's a lesson that is often missed in today's movies.No matter how old you get, you can continue to enjoy this Disney classic!"
30,Bambi,10,2 April 2008,A beautifully animated film directed by Dave Hand,"Not many people today know of the name Felix Salten author of Bambi. But I have through this film (like many people) and I am thinking of reading the original book including the sequel ""Bambi's Children."" Also I'm also a deer lover. This film is beautifully animated and directed by Dave Hand (Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs).My favorite scene from the film are when Thumper is teaching Bambi how say ""bird"" like teaching a foreign child (no matter from which country) English. I also when Bambi first meets Faline. Even to animal kids boys have their issues with girls. And I love the scene in Spring, when Friend Owl tries to shoo the birds away who were singing, and when he examples to grown-up Bambi ,Thumper and Flower about being ""twitterpated."" So overall, I really love this film."
31,Bambi,10,11 February 2006,"There never has and never will be another film like Bambi, it is unique and timeless!","Yes, this is my second comment on ""Bambi"". My first, now deleted comment was only a reaction of my surprise, how captivating, moving, and impressive this movie was for me, when i saw it again in 2005, more than 30 years after i saw it for the first time as a child. In the meantime, i saw it approx. 20-30 times again and due every seeing, it reveals more of its depth. So i started a exploration to find out more about it: The technique, art, Walt Disney and all the other man behind it... The essence of all is quite simple: It is, in every aspect, a monument of pure poetry and pure art! It contains only approx. 900 words of dialogs, in which was more said than in many books with 1000 pages, with a runtime of 70 minutes, it contains more depth and epic than almost every 3-hours film. It is a story about the life himself, with all the light and all the darkness.It's not a fairy tale. There is no princess to be rescued, no spell to be broken, no villain to be defeated. It contains not a typical storyline. It don't need such trivial things! It was not forced toward by ""what happens next"" suspense, it flows like the seasons, it goes on with the power of nature. It is the first and the truest circle of life, that Walt Disney created. ""Bambi"" was often called the ""typical Disney film"", but in fact, it is the most non typical Disney film! Whoever ventured in became part of an experience so strong that neither heart nor mind could ever forget it's impact!Disney and his crew didn't translate Felix Salten's Book literally into film. This was impossible due the huge differences between the technique of storytelling in a book and a film, but they catch the inner spirit that Salten described. It took more than 5 years of hard work to find the right way in transforming the book's soul into a film. And the way that they finally found was perhaps the only way that pay the highest homage to Salten's book.You may be disappointed, because there is no really a plot in it (this is according to Salten's book too; it is more a collection of incidents, that enabled the young fawn to learn the profound lessons which in time made him the wisest deer in the forest). It may be boring for some people when they saw it for the first time. But if you submerge in it, you will explore a whole new world. So forget all about story lines and plots, common in almost all movies. Let delve yourself by the gorgeous opening scene into Bambi's world! Align your expectations to that of the young fawn. It may be look so mundane, when Bambi starts to discover the world around him. The flowers, the rain, the other animals, but every new discovery is a revelation. It is the same adventure, that all of us have experienced in our childhood.Later, the world starts to reveal his somber side. The first time on the meadow, when Bambi must run away from the hunters. The first fun in the wintertime turned into the danger of starvation for the deer. And then, right after the first fresh spring grass evoke new hope, follows on of the most iconic scenes in movie history. It is a perfect off camera-scene and the turn point of the whole film, a symbol for the end of childhood and innocence for our young hero. For many young children (and for me too, when i was 5 or 6 years old and saw ""Bambi"" for the first time) this seminal scene was the first experience, that the world can be very cruel... it took more than a half century, before Disney dared a similar scene in ""The Lion King"" again. ""Bambi"" was often criticized as an ""anti hunting movie"". But is this true? No. Felix Salten, author of the book ""Bambi"", was a hunter too Perhaps only a hunter that is common with all the animals around him can wrote such a penetrating and deep story. The whole story was told trough the eyes of the animals. Man was not a typical villain with a goal, i.e. to conquer the world, to be the king or something else. Man was more like a deadly force majeure, a storm, a volcano or an earthquake, and his acting was a riddle for the limited minds of the forest creatures, and when Disney decided to let Man unseen in the whole movie, he strengthen the feeling of a dark menace. ""Bambi"" did not need a common plot nor need it sophisticated dialogs too. The story was primary told with music, colors, light and impressionistic color-shifting to depict Bambi's inner feelings rather than words. Bambi's forest is a powerful and truth, yet poetic and ethereal interpretation of the forests of our dreams...and sometimes of our nightmares, too. ""Bambi"" connecting art and poetry with reality in a way that has never seen before and never seen again. It is a movie that follows his own rules, a awesome work of art, that is comparable to Mozart's compositions or to the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci!""Bambi"" gives the most honest, gritty portrayal of the full range of art, poetry and emotion in the history of cinema. It moves you, it let you laugh, it let you cry, it let you fear, it gives you hope. It is a film about friendship and the strength of character, and about the spirit of life!There never has and never will be another film like ""Bambi"", it is unique and timeless. Walt Disney himself always said, that ""Bambi"" is his favorite of all his movies. I'm fully agree with Walt: ""Bambi"" is an immortal classic and one of the most important films of all time!"
32,Bambi,9,6 April 2016,Disney classic,"Bambi is a newborn deer heralded as the Young Prince by the other animals of the forest. He is befriended by precocious young rabbit Thumper. Together and with Bambi's mother, he explores the forest. As winter descends, Bambi and his mother survives on bark. Then a hunter kills his mother. He learns to be like his father, the leader. They survive wolves and fires accidentally set by campers. In the end, it is the circle of life.This is a real Disney classic for the youngest kids. Thumper is adorable and Bambi is cute. The music score is brilliantly set to the movie. It also has some tough life obstacles told with respect that can be absorbed by the little one. The old fashion animation is beautiful. This is one of the best."
33,Bambi,9,19 March 2016,Bambi,"I saw Bambi a few years ago on video (yes, on video. VHS. Tape) and I wasn't wowed. Since I'm reviewing all the animated Disney movies, I had to watch it again. This time, it enchanted me.Bambi is a young deer, son of the Great Prince of the Forest, known as such for being the oldest and wisest deer. Bambi grows up in the forest under the watchful gaze of his loving mother, while learning how the world works with his pals, Thumper, the rabbit, and Flower, the skunk. Life is tranquil in the forest, except for one thing: man. It is man who results on Bambi having to face the trials and tribulations of growing up.The movie is as simple as it comes. There's no epic adventure, no underlying message (unless it's to respect nature, I suppose). It's just the life of this deer, as he grows from fumbling fawn to a strapping young stag, facing grief, falling in love, and just living life.The relationship between Bambi and those around him, especially his mother, are kept simple and yet they work well. The focus is kept on Bambi. The dialogue is little and only used when needed. The script is well written. There are stakes in this story. Even though I've seen Bambi before, and even had a picture book as a child, I still gasped when Bambi got shot. This is the type of film that sucks you in without even trying.The characters are all lovable, and are well written, and animated well, too! The character animations and anatomy are truly masterful. The subtle movements show the passion behind every brush-stroke. The animation is timed well with the musical score, which also acts as the sound effects for the film. This shines out especially in the April Shower scene; it's hypnotic, mesmerizing and artful. The backgrounds are so enveloping, that it feels like you're one with nature. This isn't just a movie, it's a celebration of nature and all that it has to offer. The animators truly outdid themselves.Once again, the choir has me just as engrossed as the animation before me.The emotions are pure and visceral. There is no hamming up here. The children (well, if you can call them children) act thusly. Thumper is the epitome of what a child character should be; charming and perhaps a bit irksome, but lovable. I was wrong when I said there was no message: Thumper's father's saying about being nice or say nothing at all is something everyone should take to heart.What a beautiful film. Pure emotion, pure celebration of nature. A true animated masterpiece."
34,Bambi,,17 June 2015,Every single frame a painting of art,"Bambi is very much my favourite of the early Disney films. It's one of the first Disney movies I ever saw and even today it's an immensely enjoyable experience to sit through.As a movie it's simplistic and beautiful. The story of a young prince of the forest being born, growing, experiencing joys and sorrows, and eventually taking his place in the forest, is not all that difficult to follow, and some might even call it seemingly boring, but there's a lot of heart in every single scene, in every single moment of Bambi's life.It's also a beautiful film in every way possible, easily among Disney's finest in my opinion. The characters and especially the backgrounds are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, the various animals move with fluidity and grace, the colours are soothing and lush, and as a whole the film is simply stunning. The music is also really good, though the film doesn't contain any memorable classics, though in my opinion Little April Shower should be considered one.Bambi is one of those Disney films everyone at least knows about, if he or she hasn't already seen it innumerable times. And for a reason. It's not grand, epic and bombastic like the Renaissance films, nor did it revolutionize anything like Snow White or Sleeping Beauty did, but its good qualities cannot be understated."
35,Bambi,8,19 May 2015,Visually beautiful film with well-developed characters,"This is an animated feature produced by the Disney studio. There will be spoilers ahead:This film is an adaptation of the novel by Felix Salten. It's a good deal lighter and gentler than the novel, which is hardly surprising, given as it's a Disney film. The most impressive thing about a very impressive film is its beautiful visuals, particularly in showing the changes in season and in the climactic forest fire sequence.The Disney animators spent time studying animals in order to get the look and the movements down right, giving the film a very naturalistic, realistic feel.The story follows Bambi, a male deer, from his birth through his maturation to his finding a mate and beginning the life-cycle all over again by the close of the film. The other animals are all excited by the forthcoming birth of the ""prince"" and when he's born, they all rush to see him and pay their respects. Friend Owl is a focal point throughout the film, acting as an everyman. Two characters created for the film, a rabbit named Thumper and a skunk named Flower, serve as friends to Bambi as he grows into adulthood.Bambi passes through many events in his life, including the death of his mother at the hands of man (a hunter). It's interesting that, on its release, the film attracted criticism from hunters for essentially depicting hunting as it actually is, as being a disservice to sportsmen. Bambi comes into his own and meets Thumper and Flower again after some time apart, all three grown and quite baffled by some birds who are ""twitterpated"" because it's spring and they are in love. They vow never to act so oddly, which of course they in fact do, as each meets his love in order, Bambi being last and seeing his cousin Faline again.Bambi finds himself having to fight another stag for Faline in a dramatic scene which is effectively animated. It's followed quickly by the forest fire sequence. The film ends in the same way it began, with animals excited again at another birth, this time Faline giving birth to Bambi's fawns. The ending is quite nicely done.This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray and is well worth watching. Recommended."
36,Bambi,8,15 February 2015,The Pinnacle of Disney Realism,"Considered the last Disney film of the golden age. Pinocchio is considered the pinnacle of Disney animation and for good reason. I consider Bambi to be the pinnacle of Disney animation in achieving realism in nature. The animals look and move realistically while still retaining human personality traits and expressions. Story wise this isn't one of the most strongest films. However, the scenes with Bambi experiencing things for the first time are very charming and Thumper is one of the most adorable characters in the film. One thing I've always enjoyed about the Disney films that I've never gotten from other animated films is that the layouts and scenery always feel like a real place that I've been to. That is one thing that hooked me with Bambi; its like being right in the forest, which is Bambi's strength. Unfortunately, like Pinocchio and Fantasia, this wasn't a commercial success in its initial release due to its budget and the fact it was released during WW2 cutting off revenue.The structure and circle of life theme would be revisited decades later in The Lion King, but Bambi remains an all time classic."
37,Bambi,9,29 November 2014,Disney's Symphony for Heartstrings,"I think you could say Bambi has stood the test of time; just how many bittersweet cartoons can still divide opinion generations after initial release. It will outlast us all and probably continue to divide opinion, but I always try to bear in mind the intention of the words of rabbit Thumper's father: ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say nuthin' at all"".The birth of the prince of the forest, Bambi the deer is greeted with joy by the hordes of anthropomorphic animals, and much time is spent in various cavorting and learning, as time and the seasons go by. As the song goes there's a beautiful sound, but also a wonderful vision, the film is nearly perfect even with splendid non-pop music, joyous hand-drawn animation, and importantly is short and sweet. The supremely poignant moment when the perennially absent father breaks the bad news to Bambi through the falling snow never fails to impress me  but maybe luckily I never saw it when I was a kid - unless the mental trauma has been erased! The big enemy in this film so big with the Human Touch is Man (unseen, and his dogs, very much seen). I suppose they're pretty much equivalent but I've never been sure if it's supposed to represent an inevitable onslaught of insatiable capitalism or a simple manoeuvre for mindless hunting. Either way, it provides the chaos counterpoint necessary to validate the subsequent renewal and re-birth. Before they presumably will have to go through it all over again...Over the generations it's made a lot of people happy, made a lot of people think and a lot of people a lot of money, and it's still keeping a lot of people in jobs. Simple and captivating all too human entertainment, and still the best of its kind."
38,Bambi,9,8 April 2011,An early memory,"Bambi is the first film I can ever recall seeing at the cinema (my grandmother took me to see it at the Scala in Ryde Isle of Wight, and it must have been a mid- to late-50s re-release). Since then I have seen it many times.And the multiple viewings are because it is an excellent film. It is a simple, straightforward story of an infant growing through childhood to early adulthood: it just so happens that this individual is a deer (anthropomorphised, of course, and effectively being both a deer and a kindred spirit that we can identify with).Bambi's world not only encompasses his own growing up, but also the natural world he lives in, mother/child relationships, friendship, adolescence, natural disasters and - typically for Disney not to sugar the pill - the hard lesson of personal loss).Disney's animation - naturalistic, comedic, and effects - has never been better. The story works on all levels and the film as a masterpiece."
39,Bambi,9,6 September 2009,"Wonderful, cute, and highly recommended!","I rate ""Bambi"" with 9 stars because it is a wonderful story about an orphaned deer, and his fun-filled adventures with his friends, a skunk named Flower and a cute bunny named Thumper. The beginning is extremely sad, but the rest of the film is fun and light-hearted; especially, when Bambi tries to ice skate on a frozen pond in the forest. I highly recommend this film to children ages 10 and older because there is a death scene involved, which younger children may find rather disturbing because of the connotation of death. I know when I first saw Bambi I was only about 6 or 7, maybe even 5 and found this scene to be rather sad. In conclusion, this film is a wonderful Disney classic, but recommended for children ages 10 and above due to a death scene. Children being younger than 10 if they were to see this, may become visibly upset due to the connatation associated with death. The scene is not graphic, by any means, but the idea that something has died and isn't returning to the forest may upset young children. Buy it or rent it, you'll be pleased that you do!"
40,Bambi,8,11 January 2009,One of My All-Time Favorite Disney Films,"Bambi is the prince of the forest, son of a doe and the Great Prince (though his father is for the most part largely absent). This film explores his world, growing up and learning about the dangers of mankind and the beauty of friendship and falling in love.Next to ""The Little Mermaid"", this film stands as one of my all-time favorite Disney flicks. Certainly much can be said critically about Disney films -- sexism, racism, etc. -- but ""Bambi"" remains one of the more timeless tales. Some might object to the negative portrayal of man in this film (he kills Bambi's mother and starts a forest fire), but I don't think there's really anything controversial about how man and deer interact. This is simply the deer's perspective.The animation is beautiful (even more so in the restored version) and the characters are lovable. Thumper and Flower will be adored by both children and parents. The songs are decent, and the dialog is unforgettable. The word ""twitterpated"", while not an official term, is well-known today, over sixty years after the making of this film.If you have only two Disney films in your collection, I recommend this and ""The Little Mermaid"". (Other greats are ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""Fantasia"".) The ""magical world of Disney"" really comes alive in this picture, with the deer, rabbits, owl and more looking more lifelike than they've ever been since. Pick this one up today."
41,Bambi,8,4 May 2007,The most sentimental of all Disney Films (sniff!),"I also will consider Bambi as a classic but they is something that will disturb about it. This is one of the first animated films about one of the main characters' closest people dying is very unsettling. The part when Bambi's mother was shoot by hunters made me want to cry (sob!). The other parts of film were cute like when Bambi and Thumper were skating on the ice and when Bambi and Faline first meet each other as children were nice as well. My favourite character was Friend Owl as I have a huge thing for owls myself! As much as this is a classic, this is very upsetting for young children so I wouldn't recommend it for anybody the age of 5! 8/10"
42,Bambi,7,14 April 2013,5th of the 5 in the Golden Era,"Released 10 months after Dumbo in 1942, Bambi ends the Golden Era, with a bunch of Package films that would take up the rest of the decade.This film is about a newborn deer (Bambi) learning the basics of life, and experiencing the triumphs and tribulations of the life of a deer (like man hunting deer and other animals) until adulthood.The characters in Bambi are not humanized animals, like in other Disney films. Bambi is the young, naive deer who has to get taught how to survive, and becomes a mature man in the end. His friends (the skunk and rabbit) are cute and supportive friends. His mother is a wise deer.The characters do not burst into song, and I don't believe that there are any songs, just an amazing score. The animation is top notch, and the best of the era; you feel like you are in the forest, and there is so much detail. This film is not ranked higher because the cutesy scenes drag on for too long, and you can easily tune out at times.I you want to watch a short, beautiful nature film, this is the film to watch."
43,Bambi,8,3 November 2012,Perhaps the best American animated film ever made,"This animated film enjoys a degree of grace and artistic greatness that was never matched by Disney later and perhaps only equaled by Pixar's Wall-E in 2008, but not surpassed in its simple beauty and elegance. This film has no villain and nothing falls short from greatness. It shows the cycle of life in the forest in the most graceful way possible and is indeed a accomplished work of art. I gave it a 9/10 rating not because it is a flawed film (it is not!) but because I would only give 10/10 for a tiny set of 20 - 25 films that were made in the planet. It is still a great film and truly part of the history of cinema. One simply has to see this film and show it to their children."
44,Bambi,10,26 September 2012,what a lovely film,"All I can say is what a beautiful film! Cute animals, a love story, and the animation got me into this movie. Bambi is one of my favorite animals besides Winnie the Pooh and Mufasa (TLK). He was an innocent little deer and then he grew up into this strong buck! His character transition very quickly so that confused me a little bit. Then there is thumper and flower. I think that Bambi, Thumper, and Flower are the cutest animals and are great characters to begin with. In the 1940's trailer, they say Bambi is a love story. That's kind of true. There's romantic love, love between a mother and a child, and flower's ""crush"" on Bambi. Love is a big theme in this movie. Love tries to keep everything together, but it was separated two times: once when the mother's gone and another when a buck interferes, but it's part of the forest's cycle of love (just made that up). There were no computers in the 1940's so everything was hand-drawn. The animation looks spectacular and it works so well with the realism style that Disney's animators and artists were looking for. It looks well done and it's beautiful. I love that there's no CGI in this movie. Now, most animators are too lazy to draw a picture and they rely on computers to do the job. I think it has one of the best animation in any Disney movie I've seen. It's an awesome movie. It doesn't rely on comedy to make this picture perfect. The ending isn't typically happy, it just shows that the cycle starts all over again and the papa deer is away from his children just like his father was. It's on YouTube; watch it and you won't regret!"
45,Bambi,10,24 January 2011,A Favorite For All Ages (including myself),"Even to this day, Bambi is still the most beautiful animated feature ever made by anybody. This proves what a genius Walt Disney was. The backgrounds were stunning, the music was wonderful as well as the songs (most notably ""Love is a Song"" and ""April Shower""), plus the two main characters (Bambi the deer & Thumper the rabbit) were irresistibly cute when they're kids. Also, it's also makes my eyes bursting in tears when Bambi's mother dies (I rarely cry for a movie, but so far this scene is the only one that does, even though I'm 17 years old). No question, in my opinion, all of these ingredients make Bambi not only my favorite animated feature, but also my all-time favorite movie in general."
46,Bambi,10,12 April 2009,"Story is Deep, Multi-functional and a Singularly Beautiful & Poetic Film; yet is strangely familiar in some ways! (Read on, Schultz!)","IT HAS BEEN oft said that there are only so many plots with which to fashion a story. More correctly, the few basic plot lines can be tweaked and manipulated in such a manner as to seem to be original and truly different; but alas, when all is said and done, close examination will reveal the basic underlying energy and dramatic devices that reveal all of this basic literary DNA in the very substance and fabric of a story.AS FOR BEING able to enumerate and classify these plot lines; let's just say that this is not either our intent, nor could it be accomplished satisfactorily if we did take a half-hearted stab at it.WITH REGARD FOR today's very special guest star and literary guinea pig for our dissection and edification, Walt Disney's BAMBI (Walt Disney Productions/RKO Radio Pictures, 1942), we can only say that it is totally different in its final effect than just about anything else that we have ever had the pleasure to see. Repeated theatrical re-releases has put it into the category of the familiar and as we are only all too aware, familiarity breeds contempt; at least in a slightly varied and diminished strain. The readily available supply of VHS and DVD home video releases that are always in good supply in Wal-Mart, Sears, Kay-Bee Toys or what have you greatly increase this perception of BAMBI's being all too commonplace; hence, not being so very worthwhile.A CLOSER examination with a fresh point of view and attitude will doubtless give us a chance to come away with new attitudes.IN THE COURSE of BAMBI's roughly 90 minutes on the screen, we are introduced to the Fauna of the Forest Primeval (that's the Animals, Schultz) in many varying modes. At first we may dismiss the treatment of giving personality and the ability to express themselves as being pigeon-holed into the old Anthropromorphic bugaboo.WHILE IT IS true that the film does give personality and allows us to understand whatever communications that are utilized by the various species; at no time do any of the characters wear articles of clothing, live in human-like abodes or go to work at Mr. Slate's Construction site in Bedrock. The voice characterizations are a concession to necessity. It is the device used by Disney's crew to both impart character individuality and personality; as well as avoiding the use of a huge and excessive number of title cards. It may also be noted here that the film uses no narrator, a fact that wasn't even noticeable until multi viewings and reflection.AS FOR THE plot line, or as we Big Time Critic Wannabees call a 'scenario', this Disney BAMBI is a straight forward, no frills telling of a life in the Forest and the coming of age of its newborn crop of residents. Although it has the impact of a large segment of a lifetime, it is probably a lot closer to the 3 year mark; or whatever is the time for a newly born fawn to grow up to be an adult deer. The story is punctuated by various bumps in the road of life; with some scenes with great moments of levity, descending to some instances of true shock and horror. (Which seems to be par for the course in a Disney Full Length Animated Feature.THE INCLUSION of Hunters, their pack of hounds and the man-made forest fire are all fine hints at not the evil nature of the Homo Sapiens Sapiens, but rather as a warning about the potential danger that exists to both Mother Nature and Father Time; as well as to Mankind itself. (No, not to the Politically Correct ""Humankind"").This would seem to be a truly astute observation as well as a warning that could truly be called to be ""ahead of its time."" AS FAR AS the animal character design, the voices employed, the backgrounds and the musical score all created for this film, we can only use the highest degree of superlatives in each case. Special mention must be made of the outstanding and even breathtaking panoramic views of the Forest Primeva; which have been rendered even more beautiful and impressive with the use of Disney's Multi-Plane Camera Shots. Also, the theme song of 'Love Is A Word That Never Ends' is done in a manner that seems to be so detached from the rest of the production as to be almost Surreal. In the end, though, it all comes together; as a good Disney Feature Animation should and usually does! ALL OF WHICH brings us back to our original premise. What was it about, do you remember? Now let's not always see the same hands raised! IT WAS our non-original assertion that there are just so many basic plot out there. So, which one can we effectively place brother BAMBI? There was one recurring character who seemed to be only peripheral to the story; that being the Wise Old Buck, who in-spite of the lack of a bone-fide Springer-Povich approved blood test, was no doubt, Bambi's father. He was very aloof and only 'spoke' to the young buck to tell him that mama was now venison & a wall mount trophy above someone's fireplace.(My now, don't we sound cold?) WELL IN THE last scene, an adult Bambi has taken a position up on the hill next to the Wise Old Stag, only to have his father give him one last emotional glance before the Old Wise One moves out of the scene, presumably to go to his maker; effectively and symbolically passing the mantle of Paternal Protector on to Bambi.AND AS FOR our conclusion, we think that this was similar to Michael Corleone's assuming the position of Family Head in THE GODFATHER.WE BET you never thought we'd be comparing Bambi to Al Pacino, no?"
47,Bambi,10,26 January 2009,"BAMBI (David D. Hand, 1942) ****","I had seen most of Walt Disney's sixth animated feature film many years ago via a local TV screening which, however, omitted the climactic forest fire sequence in its entiretywhich is why I am considering it a first viewing here! Technically, BAMBI is certainly among the most accomplished works ever to come out of the famed animation studio: the level of artistry on display is so high that one scarcely believes that what he is watching is actually 70 years old and made under wartime conditions to boot! Frankly, the main story of BAMBI is pretty bland and can't hope to hold a candle to the classic children's fables like Snow White and Pinocchio; however, the film has an alternative trump card in its winning combination of typical Disney whimsy (having all kinds of animals gather round to greet Bambi's nativity) and an unheralded documentary-like feel in its realistic depiction of forest life (witness the animals' panic-stricken reaction to man's intrusion in their territory). As a matter of fact, Disney's perfectionism in this regard made the production drag on for 6 years! Therefore, together with the by-now famous characters of Bambi the beautiful deer itself, Thumper the amiable rabbit, Flower the shy skunk and the friendly Owl, we also have some uncharacteristically bleak passages: the killing of Bambi's mother by an unseen hunter and the subsequent adoption by its princely father, the older Bambi battling a rival for its loved one's affections, the aforementioned blazing forest incident, etc. Reportedly, BAMBI was Disney's personal favorite among his feature films but, at the time of original release, it proved a box office disappointment so that the company reissued SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (1937) theatrically to recoup its costs fast  a clever tactic that has become the norm for the studio since then. Another much less sensible decision taken by the studio many years later is that of making direct-to-video sequels to some of its classic legacy and, in 2006, it was the turn of BAMBI II  which isn't even a sequel really since it centers on the relationship between young Bambi and its father!"
48,Bambi,10,28 October 2006,A FABULOUS FILM! Walt Disney you have outdone yourself...... R.I.P....,"Bambi has to be one of the best cartoons the world has ever seen. It comes in as the best cartoon EVER just next to The Fox And The Hound! Now, more than 60 years after, no one has made a cartoon to its equal. Today, the only movies that kids'll watch are animated and comedy. Take Shrek, Shark Tale, Robots....everything that is made these days doesn't have the substance that those cartoons did those days. Even though I was -48 years old and my GRANDMOTHER was only 12, I still like Bambi much better than I will ever like any movie in my entire life. People still get emotional when they see it. Thank you so much to whoever is redoing it in high definition! I LOVE BAMBI SERIOUSLY WATCH IT! :)"
49,Bambi,10,15 July 2002,One of the most gutsy animated films Walt ever made.(spoiler),"Bambi is one of the 3 best animated films, Walt ever made. (spoiler) He wasn't afraid to let children cry, when Bambi's mother is killed it was shot off screen, and later when Bambi was shot, the audience felt the loss. The only other 2 animated films Walt made at that level of quality, are Snow Whites death and grave scenes and Song of the South's happy slave."
50,Bambi,10,28 January 2007,"It's Disney, what more do you want?","For reasons I have already forgotten, I decided I wanted to watch this movie again, which I first saw during its 1966 release (when I also read the book) and had seen only once in the meantime.Since I was well aware of when the sad part was coming, I did not choke up at it as much as I did at the joyous parts, especially the very beginning and end. The opening theme, ""Love Is a Song,"" beautifully sums up the movie's message: Individuals grow and die, but the love that brought them into the world never leaves. In the magnificent closing shot, Bambi's father turns and leaves as if to say his work is done and Bambi is now ready to take his place. Forty years after I first saw the film and with no one else watching, I was still very moved by both these moments.In between, I was struck by the animation during the fight scene between Bambi and Ronno, in which the lighting changes to convey the darkness of the mood. This scene is the most abstracted and artistic and approaches ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" from the previous year's ""Dumbo"" in its level of visual invention.Now I might have to read the book again, too."
51,Bambi,10,4 June 2005,"Amazing, the only 10/10 I've ever given!","I loved this movie. The animation was amazing. Today now they sometimes use too much computer animation, and it takes away from a film. This is truly animation at it's best, the kind that would take hours to make one frame. And the animals, young and old, were life like, and adorable. I live in the forest, so I was really in awe of how real it was! I did cry though when Bambi's mom died, and at the end. I know that some animals rely on the ""mate then never see each other again"", but it was so sad, because you could feel the love between Bambi and Felien, and then the dad couldn't ever be with his kids, or his wife, forever! I cried, and I hardly ever cry. This is one of, no the best Disney movie ever made. It had me glued to the TV for the whole hour and a half. I just wish I had seen it sooner, I'd already gone through my childhood before I saw this movie. I'm definitely buying the special edition DVD soon!"
52,Bambi,10,22 February 2005,20 big ones for this?,"Yes, and it is well worth it. ;-) The movie may not seem that long but a lot happens in it. And do not worry, it is not rushed or anything. It just cuts back on the boring parts other movies have.As everyone knows, this movie deals with the deer Bambi as he goes trough life and follows his ups and downs. The movie is probably best known for the part where Bambi's mother is shot by a hunter.(Note: I hereby nominate the hunter for worst fictional movie character EVER!) The most striking thing about this movie is the animation. It has been enhanced but it still shows that it is from WAY before Shrek or Finding Nemo.Not that that is a bad thing. On the contrary, the backgrounds are done magnificently and the animation of the characters is done excellently. One can clearly see that the characters are painted like regular cell cartoon characters but that the backgrounds are actually painted as in paintings. But that makes the movie so beautiful, 2 art styles mixed into one whole.The music won an Academy Award and why should it not. Best movie music I heard in a long time and it matches the scenes perfectly and adds even more magic to the movie.The story was very entertaining and beautiful and it had everything: interesting/cute characters, humor and excitement and also a few tears.The only downside is that the movie is a tad short although one would not notice it while watching it.I am not a Disney fan by default but this movie I highly recommend to anyone!"
53,Bambi,8,28 November 2004,little April showers,"Bambi is born and another cute little animated animal goes into Disney folklore. Gamboling about in the early scenes with his piping little voice the little deer has the ultimate 'aw' factor.The death of Bambi's mother remains one of the most heart-rending scenes in cinema, in animation *or* live-action, and gives a whole new dimension to the children's cartoon.The animation, too, is excellent throughout 'Bambi', whether the backdrops to the 'April Showers', through to the characterisations of Bambi and his friends such as little rabbit Thumper.One of the best of the Disney features, this eco-friendly rite-of-passage - which ends with Bambi at the head of his own little family - will last in movie folklore a long time."
54,Bambi,7,17 November 2004,A great classic...,"Bambi is a good movie. Not only is it effective in occupying the kids for an hour, but it has an emotional impact that still resonates with people of any age. The characters are all fun to watch, and it is very easy to sympathize with every one of them. That is where Disney has the real power - emotional impact. The music, the color, and the writing is modeled in such a way that you know you'll have a tear in your eye after watching certain scenes.Of the early Disney movies (pre-1960), this is probably my favorite. It's really cute, effective, and a proud landmark of the classic animation. It's more reputable than the recent cookie cutter movies that can be cranked of the computers every four months. If you have children, they will enjoy this movie. You will too."
55,Bambi,3,16 March 2006,I've wanted to say this for years.,"Call me cold-hearted if you want to, but I didn't like this movie one bit when I was a kid.Bambi (the movie and the deer) failed to interest me the entire time. This is partly because of the weird Dutch dubs, but mainly it's because of the storyline. Some may call the simplicity of the storyline charming, cute or inventive, bit I found it boring. Sure, a baby deer growing up might be cute for a while, but after that while there should be a real story popping up somewhere. One with a task or a moral or anything. Instead, the pattern of growing up continues. Adocelence, love, friendship, death and so on. Some may find it interesting, but I really missed an actual plot.Because of this continuing pattern (and my lack of interest in Bambi), I wasn't affected by the 'most depressing part of the movie' at all. I cry easily at sad films, especially at that age, but while watching this movie I never even sobbed. So much for emotional impact.So in short, I felt like I was watching a goldfish grow up in a bowl. Because of that, I didn't care about any of the characters, and that's why I never liked this movie."
56,Bambi,8,15 November 2004,"An amazing picture ahead of its time, that is absolutely underrated.","I am a huge Walt Disney fan, and have been for years. There are a few films of which I don't necessarily love, but nonetheless, I do appreciate. Bambi is not one of those films. This animated classic is spectacular. The characters are lovable and unique. Thumper, for example, takes the cake. He has the cleverest lines throughout the movie and is my favorite by far. The twitter-patted scene is adorable as well. The theme behind the film is incredibly important, and the emotional sensation one feels while watching Bambi is notable. When Bambi's mother dies the reaction is intense. It is revolutionary because it's in a children's animated movie, and it occurs so early in the film. Bambi's struggles are honest and heartfelt. The fact that Bambi has to take on so many tribulations i.e.: his mother dieing, fighting for his one true love, trying to save the forest from man's fire, taking over his father's role as King of the forest, make this film significant and ahead of its time. This film not only dealt with death, but with environmental troubles as well. I do not know of another animated film that has shown such concern and awareness. I have never met another person who appreciates this movie more than me, which is appalling. The detail and artwork are memorable and quite impressive. The subject matter and focus of this film are incredibly inventive and original. The character development and relationships are charming. For me, Bambi will always be a treasure and a cherished Disney picture. I implore everyone to watch this. It is absolutely underrated and devalued. Most viewers fail to appreciate the message behind the movie and the film in its whole. Go out and rent/buy this film. I assure you won't regret it. 4 out of 4 stars."
57,Bambi,10,2 July 2004,My favorite Disney movie!,"***This may contain minor spoilers***I'm 33 years old, and I recently rented this classic Disney film for myself. I had not seen it in probably more than 20 years. This has to be the most superior of all Disney films today - largely because of its wonderful, moving story and its devotion to love of nature. I think it's because of this that it appeals more to me (and many Disney fans) than the worlds created in the fairy-tales such as 'Snow White' and 'Peter Pan' (not that those were bad movies - on the contrary!). This is also the only Disney movie I know of where a central 'good' character - the mother - is killed, although her death is not seen. ***End of spoiler warning***At the end of the film the video carries some interesting footage (featuring Walt Disney himself, as well as some of the animators who worked on the film) about the methods they used to create this animated classic. Considering what animators are capable of today, 'Bambi' is an amazing piece of work. Obviously digital imaging did not exist in 1942, and the use of 'multi-plane' cameras to create the 'layers' of forest generated images that rival, and could even be superior to, today's digital animation. Walt's meticulous attention to detail - especially in regards to animal movements - make the characters that much more believable. More than 20 years after I saw it for the first time, I'm reminded of why this is my favorite Disney movie. I believe it is to be released on DVD in 2005, and am already planning to purchase it when it does."
58,Bambi,10,24 October 2002,The greatest animated film ever,"If you haven't seen Bambi on the big screen than you have missed possibly the most powerful scene in cinematic history, when Bambi's mother is shot. This one scene defines the film to an extent that the entire remainder falls perfectly in place.  Walt's intention here was to be faithful to the intent of the author and fulfils this to a degree comparable to the best directors of the day.  Bambi is often discounted as a ""children's"" movie but it is much more than that.  The amazing un-paralled animation which was nominated for numorous Academy awards is flawless and timeless in it's beauty.  The musical score transports us from scene to scene in a method which proves Walt's early features were the standard to which other animated features are judged. The only drawback is that the film probably is NOT suited to young children."
59,Bambi,5,13 April 2011,Enjoyable for little children,"I have seen this one as a kid in theater and I haven't seen it again until a few years being an adult. Although I liked Thumper and remembered the scene in which Bambi and his friends are sliding on the ice pretty well, this movie wasn't memorable for me like for example Snow White, Aristocats or 101 Dalmatians were. Watching it again I found myself to be mostly bored for the lack of some kind of interesting story. The characters are cute nonetheless. I can understand that children will still like it as I can still enjoy watching children's movies as an adult. I guess Bambi is just not for me."
60,Bambi,9,13 October 2012,Wonderful....except.....,"I love ""Bambi"" and until ""Beauty and the Beast"" debuted, it was my all-time favorite Disney film. When it came back to the theaters when I was about 20, I was one of the only adults without kids sitting in the theater to see it--I love the film that much. The animation is brilliant and couldn't be better and the characters are just terrific. I only have one reason why I cannot give the film a score of 10--in the original Felix Salten novel, Bambi's mother was NEVER killed by hunters! So, Disney chose to terrorize the children of the world by introducing this traumatizing story element--one that wasn't 100% necessary for the plot. Such a radical and nasty change always has confused me and this is THE reason why I don't recommend the film to young kids. Brilliant....but a bit sadistic."
61,Bambi,,3 March 2012,"Perhaps the first animated film to actually, ""Touch"" My heart.","I went to bed the other night. it was 2/25/2012. The dream was, I was Bambi. It was VERY Strange. but when I woke up the following morning, I wanted to do research on the film. for the next 3 hours or so, I was watching clips, Trailers, music, and overall, EVERYTHING from the first Bambi movie. I really wanted to see it. I went to best buy, and picked it up for 20$. I saw it Monday night. and.....Wow. It was....jeez... Amazing. this one, and Bambi II, Are perhaps the only Disney movie I like. However, I will point out the negatives, and Positives. POSITIVES: Film is very cute and sweet, Animation is very good. considering it came out in 1942. The ending is....Woo.....wow.. NEGATIVES: It felt Way too short for me. 70 Minutes? *sigh*... Also, this film can be kinda dark sometimes. especially the, Bird Freaking out shooting scene near the end. That was messed up. overall, The movie is VERY GOOD. And....Flower's a dude?...Huh... anyway, My Final Rating is 10/10. Amazing."
62,Bambi,9,4 February 2008,One of the Best Movies of the 1940s,"I don't admire the Walt Disney Company that much anymore, and I don't like most of their films. But I'd say I like ""Bambi"" more than most of the movies Walt Disney made. It's too bad they don't make animated movies like this anymore. Most of the people who trash this movie don't really like classic movies, or I guess they hate drama.But this movie was different from all the previous Disney movies. This was most likely the first animated movie in which one of the good characters is killed off, it is also the first movie in which the musical numbers are not performed by any of the characters. It was very groundbreaking for its time. Today's animated movies just rip off everything from other movies, which reveals that the people who make them have absolutely no creativity. Not bad at all. I loved the soundtrack too."
63,Bambi,10,8 November 2006,Timeless Classic,"As a parent who gets asked 5 times a day by my 2 and a half year old to put Bambi on over and above Ice Age 2, Nemo and other children's greats I can give this 64 year old movie a big 10. I remember it as a child and as I was watching it tonight with my father (grandson on his lap) My father could also remember it as a child.... Totally timeless except for the shooting bit which I suppose was OK back in post war periods but to be honest can be explained away as quickly as it takes to say firework. The animation is still superb and the depth of the story is still compelling enough for adults despite its age. I think this film will continue to be a shining star in the Walt Disney empire and even belittle a lot of their latest and greatest CGI output simply because of its genuine, down to earth simple story telling.... Is that more than 10 lines? Who knows, but a giant 10 to a great film."
64,Bambi,10,6 November 2006,Very touching Disney classic about survival and special friendships for all ages that will warm your heart,"BAMBI, in my opinion, is a very touching Disney classic about survival and special friendships for all ages that will warm your heart. I really loved the things that Tod and Copper did together. If I could have, I would have helped him get to safety myself. The only problem is how I would get them to safety, since I don't drive. The score was good, the animation was perfect, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about survival and special friendships for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it."
65,Bambi,10,19 July 2006,One of Disney's All-Time Best,"This is easily one of Disney's all-time best films. It's simple, yet very moving. The artistry of it is stunning. But I think the best thing about this movie is the music. Music plays an important part in any Disney film, but I think it works the best in this one. ""Little April Shower"" is great, as is ""Let's Sing a Gay Little Spring Song"". But I think the best song in this is ""Love is a Song"". It captures the essence of the film. Every time I hear it, I feel as if I'm walking through the forest and I hear the singer's voice far off in the distance and I'm walking towards it, trying to find it. That's when a song works in a movie. I love this movie, and I love that song."
66,Bambi,,27 March 2004,A classic animated film with a life full of lessons.,"Bambi comes into this world with his mother tending to his needs. Bambi goes around looking at his environment and finds friends.  He finds a rabbit named Thumper and a skunk that he calls Flower.  Then these friends learn from each other.  Thumper tells the famous saying,""if you can not say anything nice, then do not say anything at all.""  I think that everyone should live by that rule.  Them Bambi meets Faline, which is a fawn.  They all grow up and Bambi and Faline fall in love. Bambi learns life long lessons in this movie from everyone else.  So, this movie will help children learn just like Bambi.  It states the facts on how everyone should eat their greens.  In the beginning is shows all of the different types of animals.  Then winter comes and the animals go and hibernate.  The most important thing to learn is that danger is out there, and everyone needs to be careful. This movie is a very cute, short, and enjoyable movie.  This movie is short, and it is good for children to watch.  Most of the time movies are too long, and children will not sit still long enough for the end of the movie. ""Bambi"" is a very vivid and interesting movie.  Besides all of the violence, this is a perfect movie for children to learn about different animals, and life long lessons."
67,Bambi,,19 March 2002,Disney's Most Fascinating Classic,"Walt Disney's ""Shower Scene"". In the movie genre, when the expression ""The shower scene"" is used, few if any won't know that it refers to the notorious scene on Psycho. I'm sure everyone here knows which scene on Bambi I'm refering to here. Since shock value is measured in part by what one would tend to expect in a feature up to the scene in question, the death of Bambi's mother would rank at least as high in the context of a Disney feature as the shower scene is in a Hitchcock movie.When she dies, any notion of Bambi being another cute cartoon dies with her.  I'm tempted to refer to her as the personafication of the quintessential doe. Deer-does in particular-have a reputation for being very docile & gentle(though they are by NO means limited to that disposition)and Disney's only Principle casualty does more to personify that  than probably any other deer in the movie. If she had been killed by wolves, rather than humans, the scene would have been less potentially disturbing.  One of the fascinating things about Bambi is that it does juxtapose things in such a way that makes it an inherently disturbing story.  Instead of raising animals up to our level-like Mickey Mouse-it brings us down to theirs, as if we were one of them. Then reminds us that we like to hunt them. Inherently disturbing because it fuels anti-hunting sentiments & potentially puts those who think hunting's OK on the defensive. This makes Bambi surprisingly provocative. I may elaborate more on a later edition, but what I want be be sure to add here is that humans  are in Bambi what wolves are in Red Riding Hood, what the great white shark is in Jaws, what mako sharks are in deep blue sea, & what veloceraptor is in Jurassic Park. None(including humans) are necessarily evil, but relative to the protagonists in the respective stories, they are the Enemy Species. It's an interesting switch watching a flick where we are the enemy ""beast"". Like the MAN vs NATURE conflict in reverse. Personally, I think it unwise to judge the killing of a deer as worse than the killing of a cow. Deer may be prettier, but that's a dangerous criteria for appraising the value of life. However, the fact that deer have so endeer-I mean-endeared themselves to us makes them excellent protagonists in this classic."
68,Bambi,9,14 November 2014,"Not a film, a piece of art.","Bambi is unique in every sense of the word. Now I don't claim that this is the ultimate animated film, however I will state that for me, this is the first epic animated film. For a start, and their is no room for debate for this, it is the most beautiful animated film ever created. Nothing has ever come close and I use this example as to why 2d animation is superior to the modernised 3d. It's hard to define what makes this film so pretty. Maybe it's the watercolours used in the background, maybe it's the use of the multi plain camera like in the opening sequence. For me I think what makes this stand out is the combination of the two plus the striking colour contrast in certain tenser points that give this film it's beautiful almost surreal feel which has never been equalled.Let's move to the music. The like of dialogue in the film (it's something like under a thousand word) and the changes from gentle melody to epic score give the film the feeling of a ballet. Now I'm no fan of counter tenors. I'm really not. But using counter tenors for the vocals was a stroke of genius. For a start it gives Bambi a signature piece, a trademark. It also adds to the surreal feel.Finally the feel this film give is incredible. This film can turn on a sixpence. It twists from surreal and floating to dark and tense within seconds. Taking the audience of all ages through the emotional rollercoster. Now I do prefer lion king as a film (mainly because the story has more direction where as Bambi tends to float aimlessly) but for a piece of art, for an assault of all your senses and emotion. Bambi is the king that will not be dethroned"
69,Bambi,6,8 November 2014,A very underrated Disney classic in Walt Disney's era,"OK this may shock some people but I never seen this movie before only a bit of it. So I got it on DVD for a bargain and watched it a few nights ago. The film is about Bambi who is friends with a cute rabbit named Thumper(because he thumps his foot a lot),and Flower(a skunk that Bambi named Flower)and Bambi is known as the crown prince. His very attached to his mother (who of course gets shot near the climax so everyone knows this was gonna happen anyway)and we get to see Bambi growing up to be a stag by the end of the film and falling for a Doe along the way who we see as a kid. Throughout the film we watch Bambi grow up from being a fawn to a stag and it was interesting to see him evolve during the movie. The animation is beautiful,the backgrounds are nice to look at and overall there isn't much to say about this movie. In my opinion its not really the best in Walt's era but I still enjoyed it for what it is since I love animal movies. My only complaint is that I wished they added another 15 minutes to it as its a very short movie (running time is 67 minutes aka 1hr and 7 mins)but still if you love animal movies like Lady & The Tramp,101 Dalmations and The Aristocats then check it out)."
70,Bambi,7,8 January 2014,Charming and adorable although sporadically dark,"The story of Bambi is one of Disney's movies that families praise to this day for its cute characters and sentimental story. This is true but it's hard to say whether the story of Bambi is one only intended for children. It involves childlike characters and experiences yet the story arc as time continues tends to become more adult related and a slight bit one sided. It's not to say children shouldn't watch it; it's Disney. There just happens to be more to the life of the main character than just living in the forest. By the end of the movie, a message far deeper than its premise will leave a stain of a memory.The movie is basically a cycle of how the animals live in the forest and how they deal with the seasons and man itself. It's a satisfying cycle although cliché none the less. For this specific time line, no age bracket is skipped. The stages of becoming a toddler, young adolescent and adult are all covered which gives each age group that views this, something to relate to. The segment of becoming an adult and finding romance is where it gets a bit one sided. This particular segment makes the female animals look like they manipulate and end up making the male animal putty in their hands. This doesn't happen in real life for animals or humans as easily as it's made out to be.There are two other things that might turn off viewers. Next is the music; Frank Churchill did an excellent job at the score but the choir in the background in most of the music may come off as obnoxious. It's good the way they were used to represent the weather, but it still may get on viewers' nerves. And then there are the dark elements to this film such as ""man"", Bambi's mother's death and the final chase scene. These can be quite intense and almost leaps over the line of the family friendly to adult animated feature genre. Especially the hunters, these faceless dangers are the ones who speak the message of how dangerous humans can be. If Disney didn't own the rights, one could assume an animal rights activists group produced this. That's how strong the writers to this movie wanted us to feel for these forest animals.But credit should be given where is needed. The animation is great for its time. It still has the classic Disney feature feel and still holds up great today. Also the characters are very amiable. The voices to every character are very soft, mellow and calm. There are only a few times when a voice is elevated to excitement or terror. The child voice- actors that portray young Bambi, Thumper and Flower have the most adorable voices. The best voice of the rest of the cast is Bambi's mother's voice. That voice has the most gentle sound one could ever hear. Overall it's a decent Disney film; it just needs to be shown to a mature audience.The story of Bambi is cute along with his friends Thumper and Flower, and the music is done well too. Sadly, the audience that this movie is directed to can be a little heavy at some points, especially for Disney."
71,Bambi,10,23 November 2011,Disney's early masterpiece,"I've always thought these Disney animation were from the '50s, and am surprised to find out that they were made in the '30s and the '40s.This is one of Disney's early masterpiece. I mean they are all masterpieces, but if you compare this to say like Disney's earlier animated feature Cinderella, the advancement in artwork is obvious. Each scene is vividly beautiful, and flawless. Movement is - well even better than the real thing.My comments are worthless in describing movies of this caliber. All I could do is watch it and be awed.One of the few movies that could truly be called a masterpiece."
72,Bambi,,4 September 2011,Interesting movie,"This was a very interesting movie. It involved a deer which grows up, and learns many interesting things. At some points during the movie the enemy, 'man' in this case, starts to come once in a while. I felt that the movie was portraying man a bit too evilly, however they didn't show anything dangerous or violent.It ends like it began, only you have now seen the deer (Bambi) grow up. All in all it isn't a horrible movie, even though a few parts in the beginning were a little slow to my liking... mostly just watching as Bambie tries to walk and the animals make fun of him...However, it's still a good movie, rated 7/10."
73,Bambi,10,24 December 2010,"Bambi : Happy In the Heart,True To The Soul","Bambi.My #1 favorite Disney animated movie. Temporarily replaced by Beauty And The Beast,but then I came home again. I first saw this picture in the summer of 1979 at a youth activity center. This was in San Diego,California and they had acquired a large reel copy to play on projector in the gymnasium. Best of all,it was free.We all sat down and the film began. I (Like any kid) enjoyed every minute of it. The animals all gathering for the birth of the ""Young Prince"",Bambi & Thumpers cute and funny moments together in play,kind of like human kids are together and the whole story of Bambi growing up in the forest.Then later,my favorite part of the movie,Bambi becoming ""twitterpated"" (in love) with Feline the Doe,who he'd met earlier and she'd teased him terribly when they were little. His buddies Thumper & Flower falling into it as well with females who seemed to take the lead in attracting.As a boy,I thought some of the songs were corny but somehow,""Little April Showers"" managed to get my attention. Leading me to get a copy (vinyl) of the Bambi soundtrack itself. I grew to like the other songs eventually.Now,this all could have been very ""happy"" & gentile but Walt Disney knew better,the reality of the animals existence was put in play also. The harsh winters with little food,""man"" hunting them down in the forest and on the meadow.Somehow,when Bambi's mother was shot,it didn't really resonate with me what had just happened. Either I was distracted or maybe to young &naive' to get it. I know a lot of children cry at that part and I might have,if I had known.It might seem a little quick to go from Bambi's father taking him off in the snow,to him being fully grown but it's easy to see he'd been learning from his father. (That was the plot of Bambi 2 actually). Demonstrated greatly when Bambi has to fight another male deer who's trying to take Feline for his own. Great animated fight scene.The animation is wonderful for it's time and the story itself is timeless,since it's basically about life and living in it. To give Bambi anything less than a ten star rating would be like Thumper not stamping his feet. (END)"
74,Bambi,10,29 September 2010,"Still a classic, nearly 70 years later","Bambi is truly on of the best movies that Walt Disney ever created, and for some very simple reasons. The story, though it deviates away from the book by Austrian Felix Salten, is still powerful enough to tug at heart strings, yet still appeal to young children, and with lines that make the audience wonder and laugh with the young fawn as he explores his world. The animation and the camera techniques are absolutely gorgeous, making you feel like you are in the forest this story is taking place in, long before 3-D techniques. The music is fantastic, and Disney make the most of it, stretching the music through most of the film, though the few times the score does stop, such as the first time ""Man"" enters (with the immortal line ""Man is in the forest""), and when the Great Prince reveals that Bambi's mother had died (still one of the most emotional scenes in an animated movie I have seen), it is even more powerful.Overall, Bambi is still a Classic, and would have been better received had World War Two not closed off the European Market to American movies, along with the original lack of American interest. No movie of the present, except maybe the Lion King, could come close to matching the realism, the beauty, or the story of Bambi. It sets the bar for the genre of animated movies, and few can match it."
75,Bambi,,12 August 2010,The End of The First Golden Age of Disney Animation,"In the works for several years at the Disney studios, ""Bambi"" finally debuted in 1942, at a bad time for the studio. America had entered World War II the previous year, and financial returns for Disney films were disastrous (except for ""Dumbo"", which was relatively cheap to produce). ""Bambi"" would be the last film by Walt Disney until ""Alice in Wonderland"" to display big ambitions. It was actually less elaborate than planned.""Bambi"" is a film that has a small amount of dialogue, and because of this, it soars. The film's animation is beautiful and among the best you'll ever see in any animated film. Disney outdid himself once more on this film, and it shows, from the opening multiplane shot all the way to the final frame of the film. ""Bambi"" tells a wonderful story, of a young fawn's journey to become the Great Prince of the Forest. Throughout his life, his mother is taken from him at the hands of an unseen hunter, he makes several friends and he makes an enemy later on in life, and then he finds love.""Bambi"" might not seem special if one hasn't seen it, because the modern Disney advertises the film poorly. From the ads, it looks like happy deer and jumping around with cute critters. They never show the dramatic act of the story with the death of Bambi's mother, adult Bambi's fight with a rival buck, the attack on the forest by a lot of hunters leading up to the terrifying forest fire.""Bambi"" succeeds because of the drama, and it also succeeds because of the beautiful art direction and the stunning character animation. A lot of work was put into getting the anatomy and movement of deer right, and they succeeded. The soundtrack is also strong, ""Little April Shower"" starts off as lightweight pitter-patter and then it becomes a loud, booming thunderstorm of drums, crashing and loud choruses. ""Love is a Song"" and ""Looking for a Song"" work as love songs. The rest compliment the visuals. ""Spring Song"" might abruptly come after the somber aftermath of Bambi's mother's death, but it shows that Disney doesn't spend any extra minutes on melancholy and moves on in order to progress the story.A 10 out of 10. After this film did poorly when it was released, no Disney animated feature afterwards showed this level of ambition and artistry, with the exceptions of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" (which both did poorly when they were first released). The Disney films that followed are tame in comparison, but most of the 1950s Disney animated features succeed because of their stories and characters."
76,Bambi,10,15 November 2009,Just simply amazing,"Bambi is simply one of the best Disney movies. It's full of mixed emotions, and it just stunned me!I'm not gonna go 'Oh oh oh His mother dies, so so sad', like a lot of people do. Yes, it's a very sad scene, it's heart-breaking. But it's not the only thing I remember the film for. I remember the film for being a touching story of a deer and the main incidents of his life. It's such a classic!I love the character of Thumper, not because he's cute, he's funny, and brings some comic relief to the film. Aw, and Bambi learning to walk and speak, that was just too cute! I give it a 10/10, because really, it's amazing."
77,Bambi,10,30 December 2008,One of the best cartoons ever,"This is one of the best cartoons ever created.It is a educative cartoon about a deer named Bambi from the moment of his birth to the moment he is all growned up. The story contains all the important moments in life.It is highly recommended for children. The story begins with the birth of a deer named Bambi , his evolution throgh life , his first words,first friends( a rabbit named ""Thumper"" , a skunk named ""Flower"" and another young deer named ""Felice""),his first tragedy (his mother is killed by a hunter),growing up besides his father and becoming a mature deer. After watching ""Bambi 1"" it is recommended that you watch ""Bambi 2"".The graphic is much better. I give it 5 stars ( ***** ) out of 5 ( ***** )"
78,Bambi,10,13 August 2006,A True Disney Masterpiece!,"In the forest, dozens of animals gather to see a young deer's recently-born baby, whom she calls Bambi. The mother teaches Bambi everything he needs to know about the world. Bambi makes some friends: the shy skunk Flower and the boastful rabbit Thumper. After winter is over, Bambi and his mother are eating the spring grass, when the mother senses that Man, a real danger to the animals in the forest, is near, she and Bambi run for the safety of their home. Bambi is heartbroken when he discovers that his mother was killed. Bambi is taken in by the Great Prince of the Forest, a deer that all the animals look up to. Bambi later grows up and falls in love with Faline, a childhood friend. When the forest is put in danger by Man's campfire, Bambi must save the animals and Faline. Bambi and Faline safely flee the burning forest, and that spring, Faline gives birth to two fawns. The story ends on a shot of Bambi, who was crowned as the new Prince of the Forest.When SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was still in production, Walt Disney discovered a book called BAMBI by Felix Salten. Disney loved the book so much that he decides that it would make an excellent film. The Disney artists studied the characters' real-life counterparts to make their animation as real as possible. Disney intended for BAMBI to be released after SNOW WHITE, but instead, PINOCCHIO followed SNOW, and soon later, FANTASIA, and then, DUMBO in 1941. BAMBI was finally released in 1942. This is one of the Disney Studios' best films. The backgrounds are beautifully drawn, using a lot of pastel colors. The characters are ones that stay with you long after you see the film, especially the show-offy rabbit Thumper, who steals every scene he's in. It has a wonderful music score (the theme for Man later inspired John Williams for the shark's theme when he was writing the score for JAWS). BAMBI was followed by a direct-to-video sequel in 2006, which takes place after the death of Bambi's mother. Recommended. 10/10.NOTE: The Platinum Edition DVD is highly recommended, with galleries, feauturettes, games, and a digitally restored print of the film!"
79,Bambi,10,30 July 2006,"Comforting, soothing, sad, happy!!!!!","In Disney's 1942 animated classic ""Bambi,"" we have a mother deer and a little kiddie deer. However, trouble came brewing in this neck of the woods as hunters had come in and put the entire land in jeopardy!!!!! Now, it is time to find out in the movie so great, so excellent, that lessons will be learned, frowns will turn upside-down, and eyes will become wet.Okay, now my opinions: I consider ""Bambi"" so great because of the lessons, of course. One thing that we all know is that if we were these characters and if hunters were threatening us to die, then we would take action and go after them!!!!! Another lesson is about love. Here we have the mother and child. As a child (no matter how old we may be), if our parents love us, then we should love them back. That's the way a good family should work.""Bambi"" - go see the DVD or any old VHS today - it'll warm your heart like Quaker Oatmeal! 10 out of 10 stars."
80,Bambi,9,14 July 2006,Animals Come to Life in a Delightful Way,"Bambi has claimed its place as one of my Disney favorites.For one the film is beautiful. Even with the computer-animation we have today, nothing Disney has done since matches the simple beauty of the film's animation. The structure of the film, while lacking a coherent plot, is well-planned. Also the child voice-actors are just adorable in their sincerity.The only thing I did not particularly like about this film was the soundtrack which was the only part about this film that felt a little dated. However, the film is just so brilliant it doesn't hinder the viewing experience."
81,Bambi,8,22 March 2005,Truly amazing on DVD!,"The recent re-release of ""Bambi"" was something I was not in an immediate hurry to buy, but I am sure glad I did. In fact, it is the perfect DVD companion to the ""Disney On Front Lines"" collection that recently came out, because it was in theaters during World War II.Here again is a movie that went through a pain-staking restoration. In fact, the Disney people had to go through the film frame by frame, correcting colors and scratches that built up over the years. Hosted by Patrick Stewart, the documentary was very interesting. The final result is incredible to look at, for the film does not look like something that was released 63 years ago.This collection has some additional fascinating extras that really make it worth the purchase. Stewart explains about meetings Walt Disney had with others in the studio. On this DVD, they were re-enacted by actors for a voice over that showed how a lot of ""Bambi"" was put together. Whoever it is who performed the Walt Disney voice, he sounds exactly like him.Beyond that, this is an extremely captivating work. Disney remarked that a portion of the film was inspired by something he had done in a Pluto cartoon, and a side-by-side comparison demonstrates it.This is truly great stuff for any Disney collector. For myself, I have always been enthralled by all of the incredible accomplishments Walt Disney had done in his day. I truly recommend this. Certainly, ""Bambi"" is a great film, but this DVD manages to make it even better."
82,Bambi,,6 March 2005,S10 Reviews: Bambi (1942),"Bambi is the quintessential coming-of-age film. It covers all the facets of everyday life. Survival, love, laughter and inevitably loss all intersect in one of Walt Disney's most endearing animated fables. Bambi tells the tale of a fawn, ""The Great Prince of the Forest"" who goes through all the growing pangs of life. Surrounded by friends (Thumper, the Rabbit and Flower the skunk to name a scant few) with whom he frolics about the forest with dealing with the hazards of man and disaster and the loves of life.Animated wonderfully, Bambi is a classic for the whole family. It contains life stories that will never change and immortal characters that will never die."
83,Bambi,10,16 February 2005,This beautiful little fawn.,"First I must say, thanks to Disney Movies Inc, for digitally remastering such an old film, was it really in 1942 that this beautiful film was made?? I really like this cute animal story, I particularly like Thumper. when you get the DVD, you get a free Thumper to adopt as your own. This story is about Love and kindness. It is also sad when Bambi's Mother gets shot. I was moved to tears when I first watched this scene when I was just a boy! I also like all the gentle voices and such good music.On the DVD, you get 2 discs and there are a lot of extras, too many to go into on this review. Personally I rate this film 10/10! for such a gentle story but because man is so careless, the forest is burnt to the ground! but Bambi survives! I also like little Faline! she is so cute! I have never seen a real baby fawn. but Bambi is so cute as well. He was shy when he met Feline for the first time. I think that I would be in his shoes or hooves in his case!"
84,Bambi,,6 June 2003,One of the most frightening screen villains you'll never see,(Possible Spoiler)  Recently AFI chose its 50 greatest heroes and villains in its on going celebration of 100 years of motion pictures.  One of its top villains came from this film.  The villain is never once seen but yet without question after seeing this film you will agree why the villain was chosen as #20 in AFI's top 50.  It is Bambis mother who in a very chilling voice discloses to her young Buck who the villain is when she tells young Bambi that `Man was in the Forest'
85,Bambi,10,25 October 2002,One of the best animated movies ever made!,"I watch Bambi every year, few times per year, and I repeatedly enjoy it. In the present days I always as myself - do authors of these-days animated movies watch Bambi? Disney team that made Bambi in 1942 should be proud of themselves. Making such movie without equipment they have now probably was great adventure. Personally I believe they made better animated movie than most companies these days..."
86,Bambi,9,9 March 1999,"""If you can't say something nice...""","Bambi is easily not only my favorite Walt Disney movie, it is a classic. The emotions brought through the screen by the hand drawn characters range from happiness to sadness, love to hate, life to death.  The process of coming of age and the concept of the circle of life is brought to us way before Lion King was ever an idea.  We are not forced into anything.  Bambi offers us a way to flow through emotions, become a kid again, and enjoy an animated film in pure form, without the aid of computers.  Great words to live by, ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all."""
87,Bambi,,27 April 2001,The Greatest Disney Film of All Time.,"""Bambi"" is my favorite Disney animated feature. It has the most emotional power of all the Disney movies. The characters, music, songs, and story are all just great. Thumper is my favorite character. He steals the whole movie, with great lines of dialogue and facial expressions. This was Walt Disney's personal favorite of all his movies, and I'm proud of him for that. Walt was born to make this movie, along with ""Pinocchio"". ""Bambi"" and ""Pinocchio"" are unbeatable and vintage Disney classics."
88,Bambi,10,30 November 2017,A slice of life in the forest.,"Why such a low rating, people? Bambi, along with Pinocchio, is a perfect depiction of the often mischievous gift called life. While the overall message of Pinocchio is directly out-spoken, Bambi masters the art of subtlety, because we never have to face one true evil and never see Man in the forest. Bambi just has to deal with the inevitable in life. A slice of life is what Bambi is. We see him as a kid growing up to become the new great prince of the forest and he faces both happiness, rivalry, love and even loss of loved ones. Bambi makes kids acquainted with all sorts of emotions and the beauty of the forest with heavily atmospheric music and visuals instead of sugar-coating it with all happy and bouncy talking animals without any educational aspect or depth to them. That is the definition of an excellent animated movie. There is enough for both kids and adults without insulting the intelligence of kids. Easily one of Disney's best."
89,Bambi,8,3 September 2016,"The longer the movie went, the more I liked it.","The movie starts off pretty slow, but it picks up around the half-way point. It wasn't until there was about 25 minutes left that I realized the story was about growing up. A bit of a delayed realization I know, but I was honestly too distracted by how cutesy it was. Once the 30 minute mark passed, I didn't think I'd like this, but once the darker moments started to show up, I liked it a lot more. Apparently the novel it's based off of is more graphic, I might have to give that a read sometime. The theme of growing up has been done better in Disney movies, (look at ""The Lion King"" and even ""Inside Out"" if you want better examples) but ""Bambi"" is a good addition to that list. It's beautifully animated, innocent at times and pretty dark as well. I recommend showing your kids this if you want to show them what it's like to grow up in a nutshell."
90,Bambi,8,5 August 2012,A sweet and beautiful Disney film,"To many people Bambi is one of the first films they would have seen as a child and the first film to cause a strong emotional reaction for many viewers. Bambi is a classic piece of Disney cinema, made in a period of excellent Disney films, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Dumbo and one of my childhood favourites, Pinocchio. The animation throughout is gorgeous, with detailed, watercolour backgrounds, wonderfully flowing and realistic looking animals and very inventive at times. The musical score blends with the actions on the screen and serves as a great example of how music enhance the visuals. Bambi is not a film that supply massive laughs but there are plenty of chuckles to be had from the physical humour and adults will get a chuckle from the actuate portrayal different types of children. There is also an early environment message about the damage men can cause because of their reckless behaviour and serves as a constant threat for the animals. Bambi is a sweet film about growing up and the lost of innocents throughout"
91,Bambi,8,5 February 2012,Dear deer,"Honestly my first time watching this vintage Disney classic and a delight it was too. The animation of the main characters is delightful and while most of the backgrounds are static, they are largely well-rendered, although I'd have to say that the depiction of fire didn't seem, well, fiery enough. It all starts with the baby deer's birth and neatly competes a narrative circle by ending with the birth of the now-grown deer's own offspring. The story is episodic and takes in every aspect of a deer's life one is even vaguely aware of, like their difficulty learning to walk just after birth and how males lock antlers when fighting, although it was news to me that they seemed so revered amongst their fellow-creatures. The supporting characters are either sympathetic (Bambi's mother, the wise old owl) or fun - Bambi's friends Thumper and Flower. Dialogue is sparse but well-used, not weighing down the simple-to-follow story with too many words. Music, naturally plays an important part in the film, with effective use of background music and songs, especially the ""April Showers"" sequence. The plot doesn't shy away from making points about indiscriminate hunting by humans and more general conservation issues about protecting animals' natural habitat, without once showing a human. There's pathos too, none more so than when Bambi's mother is shot and killed by man. All in all, short as it is, this was a delightful feature to watch of a Sunday afternoon, just keep a dry handkerchief near by at the end."
92,Bambi,9,28 July 2011,Man was in the forest!,"Bambi both heartwarming and heartbreaking.Bambi starts off with a sleepy feel but gets going once all the forest animals spread word of the birth of the newborn prince. We see Bambi grow up with his childhood friends Thumper and Flower. One day Bambi's mother takes him into the thicket to meet more deer and she warns him not to jump right out because there might be danger; or in other words hunters. Bambi goes into the thicket and meets more deer friends along the way.At one point in the movie Bambi and his mother are starting to enjoy the first signs of spring. Unfortunately a hunter shows up and we see perhaps one of the most traumatic scenes in thematic history. Bambi's mother leads him to safety only to be shot. While we don't see it we know what happened and Bambi's father tells him that he can't be with his mother anymore. The scene after this is more jubilant and seems to quickly go over the sadness of the last part. Here we see animals start to fall in love during the spring season. Bambi has now become an adolescent deer and he meets up with his childhood companions. The Owl that lives with them in the forest warns them about spring infatuation. Flower, Thumper and Bambi all agree that it will never happen to them; or so they say.In the last few minutes of the movie a fire breaks out after some hunters carelessly leave it. Bambi has to leave and he barely escapes in time along with his father. At the end of the film Bambi has fathered two fawns with Faline and he sits proudly watching on the hill along with his father.Bambi has a fantastic music score along with sounds of crashing cymbals and slow violin music that build up during the climatic scenes when danger is near. All the songs are decent and don't border on anything that might make your head pound. Bambi is a great film. However there are some things that I don't like. The background animation was not the best and that may be in part due to the fact that the war was still going on during that time and the studio may have suffered some financial problems. Also I think that the hunting scenes get a little out of control and can be hard to watch for younger viewers."
93,Bambi,8,17 June 2008,One of my favorite all-time ever?,"It always comes up when people are comparing their most traumatic movie experiences: ""the death of Bambi's mother,"" a recollection that can bring a shudder to even the most jaded film-goer. That primal separation (which is no less stunning for happening off-screen) is the centerpiece of Bambi, Walt Disney's 1942 animated classic, but it is by no means the only bold stroke in the film. In its swift but somehow leisurely 69 minutes, Bambi covers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when ""man was in the forest""). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up for it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, but Bambi is so simple, so pure, it's almost transparent. You might borrow a phrase from Thumper and say it's downright twitter pated."
94,Bambi,9,20 March 2006,great classic Disney movie,Bambi is my favourite Disney cartoon film it has the old Walt Disney magic and has great animation. It is a classic at the bit when Bambi and Thumper are learning to icescate (well mainly Bambi) nd they find flower hibernating. The twiterpated bit will always be a favourite Bambi bit off mine when they all fall in love even after owl has warned them. It does have its sad bits and when Bambi's mother dies it is such a tear jerker. I love the beautiful background that Bambi is set on with all the beautiful colours blending in to make the beautiful forest background. Bambi is an all time classic that will never fade and will always remain a favourite in any house with a young child.
95,Bambi,8,13 November 2005,A VERY Good film. a classic,"Bambi is one of the best Disney animations ever created. It's cute and done well, complete with an emotional-but-realistic story about loss and growing up. Who hasn't seen this film and does not remember the memorable Bambi-and-Thumper-on-ice scene, which is cute in a clumsy way but also well-animated? (I had read once that the artists studied a live fawn's movements while drawing the animation sequences.) I have seen this film in the past five years, and I was amazed to see that I found it just as cute (and sad) as I did when I was much younger. All children should see this film, and it's still worth watching if you're older. I wish Disney still made films like this one."
96,Bambi,9,11 November 2005,there will never be a dry eye when you see Bambi. You have to see it,"I first saw Bambi when i was very young, and it had remained a favourite Disney film since. i loved Bambi, but didn't understand the plot at first, but hey, i was only a tot. After seeing the film more often, I have seen that it is emotional in it's own individual way and still remains a classic love story, with it's adorable characters. The emotion in this film doesn't make it a sad or disheartening one, as many people over-exaggerate on this, but it shows the audience a view of life from different view. We as the audience see how heartless some humans can really be, which gets us in tune with our sensitive side. Bambi is an excellent, must-see movie for everyone. it is beautifully made, very advanced for a 1942 film, and has held it's charm ever since."
97,Bambi,9,13 April 2014,Animation classic,"An animation classic. Sweet, innocent, (mostly) feel-good movie. Funny, quirky and the animals are incredibly lovable. Not entirely sugar-coated though: a few dark moments, which may not be entirely suitable for children (though I guess they have to learn that life isn't all just positive events and happy endings at some stage). The darker side provides a good balance to the more child-orientated scenes.The circle-of-life parable is well told. The animation is superb, even by 2014 standards. By early-1940s standards it must have been cutting-edge.Voices are well-cast. None of the animals' voices seemed at odds with their characters.Not perfect though. One negative is that the movie is too short. Some more development of some of the themes would have been good (eg we don't see how Bambi reacts to and copes with tragedy. Next scene is all happiness, as if nothing happened).A classic, and suitable for everyone."
98,Bambi,5,20 February 2008,Classic? Big deal.,"Bambi -- the great classic, the typical showing of real emotion of a young deer who loses his mother. What a load of crock.Admittedly, I just re-watched Bambi again for the first time in years, but I was a bit disappointed because I remembered this film being better when I was younger, however, I wasn't very impressive this time around. Aside from the horrible music in this film, the lack of a real plot and characterization of characters stood out greatly in my mind.This film moves too fast not developing much of anything of giving you any reason to develop an attachment to the characters. People who rate this as being a ten probably just have never either read good literature, watched something with a truly engaging plot, or just like any piece of junk they come across.It's not all bad I suppose, just boring, bland, and not what it's all cracked up to be. I will give it a five though for not just being a cutesy film based on no fact. They didn't completely murder the film by making the deers live in nuclear families or some crap, but nevertheless this movie is not something that I consider to be a great classic although for 1942 I suppose the animation is good. There were a few moments in the film that I thought were at least somewhat memorable and others that I felt added nothing to the already almost non-existence plot line. All and all though, it wasn't terrible just not good either, something in the middle that really needed some work."
99,Bambi,7,12 October 2013,One of the more depressing Disney movies.,"This is one of the more depressing and saddest Disney films, about a young deer named Bambi who has to grow up alone in the forest after his mother is shot by a hunter. As he grows up, he faces a slew of adventures in the woods and intermingles with characters that will forever be memorable in movie cinema like Thumper and Flower.The animation is great, as usual. The song ""Love is a Song"" is rich and beautiful, sung by Donald Novis, and was nominated for an Oscar. The orchestral score was wonderful and breathtaking, suiting the innocence and carefreeness of the wild animals perfectly. There is really not much of a solid plot to the story, as the movie is basically about Bambi growing up in the forest, making friends, finding love and taking on the ""Prince of the Forest"" title. But, there is moral to the story about survival and the circle of life. The many animals characters, including Thumper the bunny and Flower, the skunk were memorable and adorable and they made the film that much more special. I do find the hunter scene disturbing and it put a damper in me for the rest of the movie. If you have young kids, I would show them other Disney films over this one, and then show this film to them later on in their age. While kids might fret at the hunter scene, they could also learn from the message of survival and courage that Bambi displayed.Grade B"
100,Bambi,7,11 September 2011,"More Than Just A ""Warm-Fuzzy""","Released in 1942 - Bambi (a beautifully realized motion picture) would be Disney Studios' 5th animated feature film.Bambi is a moving and exquisitely detailed film about a deer and how the phases of its life parallel the cycle of the seasons in the forest.Bambi is an extraordinary achievement, featuring the memorably endearing character of Thumper, the rabbit, who practically steals every scene that he's in.This film's screenplay has a bit more bite to it than the average Disney yarn, with equal helpings of comedy and tragedy fueling a confrontation between the forest animals and that most horrific of two-legged interlopers - Man.""Bambi"" trivia - Only about a 1000 words of dialogue are spoken throughout the entire film.When Bambi premiered in London on August 8, 1942, in the midst of WW2, reception was extremely poor. It was later re-released in 1947."
101,Bambi,7,5 January 2018,A solid conclusion to the Disney Nativity,"As yet another film my aunt had on VHS, we took some time this morning to view it. I was expecting plenty from a film I hadn't seen for almost 13 years, but I did believe it would hold up. So what do I think?I have to admit that this film did confuse me a bit with its scripting choices, such as the utilization of ""twitterpated"" to describe undeniable infatuation. For some reason, it felt slightly mature for Disney to make that choice, although we already had Pleasure Island and drunken hallucinations in the 2 preceding films of what I would call the Nativity era of Disney (or, the first 5 years before their 7 years of packages). I liked the acting and did find some of the humor to work, but I noticed that some parts of the film, such as a few scenes with Thumper and/or his sisters, were a tad too mean-spirited. One of the biggest disappointments of this film was the death of Bambi's mother; while it is indeed an emotional scene, it abruptly cuts away to Let's Sing a Gay Little Spring Song. I can understand how Disney thought that perhaps audiences might not desire such melancholy in the middle of WWII, but it was really distracting and overall was not done well as a death scene. I do have to say one good thing about it, though, in that it was a mistake I found Disney improved significantly upon 39 years later. The animation is above and beyond the standards of the Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry-infused 1942, with particularly fluid animations for the fire and also the perfect balance in the scenery between colorful and subdued. It was a sight to look at. Aside from the main song being the improper way to respond to one of the more iconic death scenes in Disney movies, I did overall think the music was above passable.I am sure that children and their grandparents would appreciate this movie, although they'll probably take the death of Bambi's mother and how it is cut away much harder than I did. For the common viewer, it's overall worth your time for its animation, music, and humor. I'll say it is definitely the right kind of film to conclude an era of actual movies."
102,Bambi,8,9 December 2017,Love is a Song that Never Ends,"Ah Bambi, what can one say about this cute innocent tale of a little deer growing up in the woods and then having his mother die?.....well OK, we all know about that on first glance, but what we also remember about Bambi is the artistry. The way the movie depicts nature is just stunning, from the trees, to the ground, to the meadows, to the fields, to the grass, to the water, to just about everything else. It really creates a sense of beauteous wonder that you don't find too often in animation. Adding on to the gorgeous backgrounds and settings, the animation on the animals are phenomenal, and considering how hard animals are to animate (let alone draw), the movements are flawless and the designs look cute enough without being nauseating, fitting the movie's feel of cute sentimentality. But when the movie gets dark, so do the lighting and shadows, and it executes both incredibly well.Storywise, it's basically just about a deer growing up in the woods, and that's it. Simple enough, yet honestly, that's why the movie works. Sometimes just seeing someone live from childhood to adulthood in a setting is interesting and captivating enough for a viewing experience. We were all children once in our lives, and this movie captures childhood really well by showing how innocent life was before we had to grow up. But then the death of Bambi's mother came, which has scared many for life, but it also taught folks that we must cherish the things we love, because nothing lasts forever, and it's important to hold on to them even when they pass on.Overall, while the movie is mostly cutesy in the first half, Bambi still stands the test of time for its Luscious artistry, charming innocence, hauntingly soothing score, and its important lesson to be warned that not everything you love for last forever. If you have kids, let them grow up with this so they can remember how cute it is, as well as heartbreaking."
103,Bambi,,27 February 2017,beautiful,"the strange fact is to be the same. at each age. if you see it after a long time. not sentimental or dramatic or scene for memorable characters. not as a pink lesson about the universe of forest. but as a well done work. as the eulogy of simplicity. or as parable. it is an animation who impress for its technique first. then, for its subtle, convincing simplicity. a parable about grow up. a lovely portrait of friendship. and one of the heroes who could be the perfect guide to discover the essence of life. a film who remains long time in memory of the viewer. as small crumbs about a heroic story. maybe as refuge. and good demand to see, after a period, again. as your face in mirror. not for admire. but for as weigh in of sensitivity."
104,Bambi,10,7 February 2017,Disney's Golden Classic,"The movie that made a modern retelling like ""The Lion King"" possible, Disney tugged on the heartstrings of so many audience members back in 1942 and continues to do so.The story of an adorable fawn and his friends during the four seasons is so simple yet metaphorical for the circle of life. Bambi learns various valuable life lessons throughout the film ranging from the importance of friendship, romance and the saddest lesson: death. The characters of the film are so lovable and diverse from the naivety of Bambi as a youth into his maturity as a young buck, the free-spirited and loyal bunny rabbit Thumper, shy and cute Flower the skunk, pretty and soft- spoken Faline who Bambi falls in love as an adult, wise and gone-too-soon Mother who begins to teach Bambi what life will have in store, the also wise but crotchety Friend Owl who tells the three best friends about romance and finally the absentee yet brave Great Prince of the Forest who is Bambi's father and saves his son near the film's fiery end (the Great Prince also raised Bambi following Mother's death as seen in the midquel 'Bambi 2'). Disney's animation is breathtaking from its hand painted characters to lavishly painted backgrounds and the innovated multi-plane camera developed by the Disney company that has been instrumental to other film mediums outside of animation. The animators developed the realistic characters by studying actual deer, rabbits and skunks among other creatures lending to believable woodland critters rather than overly cartoony caricatures."
105,Bambi,9,16 December 2016,"Stunning, Loving, Terrifying","When we hear the word ""Bambi,"" we are quick to believe that we are referring to a maudlin, sentimental portrayal of a cute little deer. That the portrayal of the animals in the forest is saccharine and precious. What is really hear is a setup whereby we gain sympathy for the everyday battles that these creatures face. The starvation, the harsh winters, the forest fires, and so on. Bambi is a child at first and innocent and is heir to his father's portrayal as the patriarch of the woods. We are also reminded that the randomness of nature and the potential violence are small compared to the planned violence of the human animal. When man is in the forest, the animals are hunted specifically, their lives having no more meaning than that of a trophy. This is a truly remarkable film and a masterpiece of animation."
106,Bambi,8,23 October 2014,A Cute Walt Disney Classic,"I love Bambi! Another Disney classic that is good for the entire family. Bambi is funny at times - but does have it's sad moments (much like Disney's Dumbo). Both classics are dramas with comedy.I love Thumper (my favorite character) - he's just cuddly and funny! Flower is adorable and very much a lovable toon. Bambi himself is cutie and with his two friends (Flower and Thumper) they set off on a great adventure.Other good Disney classics ""Dumbo"", ""Fox and the Hound"", and ""Peter and the Wolf"".8.5/10"
107,Bambi,8,23 September 2014,Animate Disney coming of age film,"This is a well developed story about a cute Disney animal. How he experienced love, friendship, relationship with the opposite sex and the struggle and turmoil he has to face and overcome. I read a reviewer complain about how this movie doesn't stay entirely true to animal life. However I personally think that isn't a big deal for a movie such as this. I think the message and the direction when it comes to the story is what matters. Now if it's a animal documentary of some sort, then I could understand. I just don't see how anyone could complain about a deer having a friendship, with a rabbit and a skunk in a Disney animated movie. As a matter of fact, I thought the friendship between Bambi and Thumper was the epitome of cute in a Disney movie. I think it's still a bit exaggerated when it comes to the tear-jerking level. I was sad as a kid to see Bambi's mother get killed, but didn't really cry or nothing. Overall, this is a well developed story about becoming a man. As a matter of fact this is basically a animated Disney movie about coming of age.8.2/10"
108,Bambi,,29 December 2011,A special lesson,"A tale. About birth, life and death. About grow-up, friendship and love. Beautiful for images and ideas. For nice hero and his mother die. For extraordinary Thumper and delicate Faline. And for the courage to make more than a sentimental cartoon. The spectacular animation is only part of a moral lesson in gentle proofs. Existence as ladder. Each step as seed of new discover. The hunters and forest fire are parts of this trip. And ways to define it. Like the transition from an old world to a new age.A film for each time of life. For each person the message is fresh and power. It is not only a show , not a Disney, but problem with solution in every soul. In each form to learn in experiences traces."
109,Bambi,4,6 March 2002,A horrible experience,"Man, did Disney miss with this one. BIG TIME! Who exactly was this movie intended for. Kids? DON'T THINK SO! It's absolutely too dramatic for them. If you thought that the scene where Mufasa dies in ""The Lion King"" was powerful you've got another thing commin'. If you're a kid reading this, a word of caution - DON'T WATCH BAMBI TILL YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO HANDLE REALLY REALLY REALLY DEPRESSING SCENES, and what's the point in that unless you've got a suicidal tendency. If this was really intended for kids I don't know what they were thinking, and I know it wasn't intended for adults, because the movie is actually really childish and boring.TERRIBLE.I cried my eyes out, and I was a small, young, innocent kid trying to watch an entertaining cartoon. Instead I was served terrible nightmares and my childhood was never the same. Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating, but there should be a label on this one, like the ones for explicit lyrics. It should say ""watch this before killing self only""."
110,Bambi,5,27 September 2010,Bambi,"The fifth animated feature to have been produced by Walt Disney (if one counts Fantasia as an animated feature), Bambi focuses on a young deer who learns what it is like living in an endangered forest  this includes communicating with other animals, forming friendships with a rabbit, a skunk and an owl, getting a girlfriend and losing a relative to the power of human hunters. Since its release, Bambi has achieved what could be described as 'cult' status. It remains popular with young generations (obviously including children) and, strangely and apparently, forced Paul McCartney to switched to vegetarian meals. However, this does not make Bambi any better than Dumbo, Fantasia or Pinocchio. Bambi is famous for the classic but phony tear-jerking scene involving the title character, one of his relatives and hunters. Apparently, this scene made some viewers cry. But not everybody who saw that scene did. There is simply no evidence why it is that tear-jerking. But deep down, Bambi's plot is very basic and very understood by children and nature lovers and the funky song Little April Shower is enjoyable to sing along to."
111,Bambi,,29 September 1999,Who Could Ever Shoot Another Animal?,"How many animal-killers have been cut off in their childhood by this great film?  I know that ""Man is in the forest"" still sends shivers of impending doom throughout my soul.  And the majestic figure of Bambi's father with that great rack seen on high makes me almost forget my feminist leanings.The figures can never be duplicated by computer cinematography, with their wonderful expressions.  Thumper pumping his foot on the log, Stinky leading his black and white clan through the forest, Bambi trying to walk.....those images are in our brains to stay.  This movie is part of any child's 'raising', which will hopefully lead to him reading the book.  The lessons, ""Obey your parents"", ""No Cruelty to Animals (hope this covers humans as well), and 'Courage Under Stress', are gently taught.The gorgeous colorful scenes should be seen on as large a screen as you can find.  This is not a child's movie that anyone else in the family will be bored with.  It was charming in the 40's; it still is........without the crashing noise, the silliness, the blood, the gore, the inanities of what goes for film fare these days.Blessings on you, Walt Disney.  Would that Eisner had one fraction of your talent and character!!!"
112,Bambi,1,25 June 2007,This is an absolute nothing,"I don't see how this became a Disney classic. This movie is guaranteed to gather dust on your video shelf, namely for its lack of plot, characterization, engaging themes, memorable moments, coherent introduction, coherent action, coherent climax, coherent conclusion, beautiful artistry, any worthwhile mental stimulation or post-viewing discussion, and just about everything else that could possibly make a movie worth watching.What happens? Bambi is born. He makes some animal friends in some way that is so unimaginative that you're likely to forget it within a week of watching. Then winter comes and hunters shoot his mom in a scene that tries too hard to be sad, and thus ends up almost laughable. Then Bambi quickly gets over it and grows up, where his friends fall in love with animals in the exactsameunimaginativeway! Then there's a fire, and Bambi has his own babies with a female deer. Probably the infant poor critters are going to be forced through the 68 minutes of indescribable tripe that Bambi had to endure. The only difference is that Disney mercifully kept us away from sequels bound to be worse than the original (which is saying a lot here).What I'm trying to say is this: the screenwriters had no imagination. None. No invention, no plot line, no credible sequence of action, just a series of unrelated vignettes pulled in long strings out the [*ahem*] and slapped wetly together to form a messy, soggy pile of melodrama so sappy that it reeks. I might have given this movie a 3 or 4 star had the artistic aspect of this film been any good. Sadly, it wasn't. Every one of Walt Disney's original movies are better in both style and visual appeal.This movie bored me as a youngster. It will bore your kids. It's a lose-lose situation. Leave it on the shelf at the video store; buy it only if you want to start a small colony of dust bunnies across the top of the case. Don't subject you or your kids to this torture."
113,Bambi,,24 April 2014,Should Have Watched It In The First 10 Years Of My Life.,"I strongly feel that I would've liked this film much more had I watched it in the first 10 years of my life because watching Bambi now surely left me with mixed emotions. It's not that the film in anyway features a disappointing story but it sure feels badly aged. However, there is still a relative simplicity, innocence & cuteness in the story of a deer who learns to survive after the animators stopped drawing his mother and its anti-hunting message makes more sense today than it did during its time. But for the most part, I felt nothing for this film & was bored throughout its runtime. Even the bloody songs didn't impress. Maybe early Disney features are far too cuter than I can handle."
114,Bambi,,14 September 1999,*sniff sniff*,I am not ashamed too admit but this is one of the few movies I actually cried at. The mommy dies so sad. Thumper is pretty damn cute though. Id say this is the most classic cartoon of all and that all kids should see it.9/10 So good
115,Bambi,,26 October 2002,An early bad animated film,"Walt Disney's 5th animated feature (released through RKO) was his second letdown for me after ""Fantasia"" but in my view, the better years of Walt Disney's animation were while Walt Disney was alive so this film is not entirely bad. There's some great nature imagery but that's about it. The characters, situations and songs are not especially likable. Things would pick up again for Walt Disney after this one."
116,Bambi,7,5 January 2015,A Disney classic,"This, Disney's original 'circle of life', opens with the forest creatures gathering at the birth of a new deer and follows him through various till he has become a father. The young deer is of course the eponymous Bambi and over the course of the film he learns about life in the forest from his mother and his new friend; a rabbit named Thumper. He learns about the other forest creatures and sees the changing of the seasons. He also learns that there are dangers; this is brought home in what is one of film's most famous deaths when is mother is slain by an unseen hunter. He manages to survive and eventually finds love with Faline and after the pair survive another run-in with hunters they have children of their own.This film is best known for the scene where Bambi's mother is killed and knowing about it in advance does take away from what should be a shocking and tragic moment. Bambi is shown to get over this event fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too upsetting for younger viewers.There isn't really a plot to speak of; we merely observe Bambi's various experiences. Likewise there is no antagonist which is unusual for a Disney film; the hunters remain an unseen threat and their hounds are only seen in one scene although there is a real sense of threat in that scene and the dogs look genuinely menacing. As one would expect from Disney the film looks great with likable character designs and good animation. The music was a bit too twee for my tastes however that is probably just a product of the times. There are plenty of laughs to be had along the way; Bambi's attempts to walk on a frozen pond was both funny and cute. At only seventy minutes long it is unlikely that anybody will get bored in fact I suspect most people will be surprised when it ends so soon."
117,Bambi,8,23 August 2012,"Trauma for Children, Nostalgia for Adults","As usual the things that work are up first. Now we all know the scene that makes every little child cry, the death of Bambi's mom. This was a very daring moment for Disney killing a main character like this, it doesn't even happen on screen but it messed all of us up inside. Next, the animation looks great. It gets the movements of the animals down quite well and it is also very beautiful with the painted scenery. Another thing I noticed is that the score matches the animation perfectly. Every instrument is played at the right moment and it's a very lovely movie to listen to, it even was nominated for an Oscar for Best Scoring Of A Dramatic Or Comedy Picture. Friend Owl just cracks me up every time and is just utterly hilarious. Also I enjoyed how big the story got in the end. I know everyone remembers the cutesy beginning, but after Bambi returns as an adult it becomes almost like an animated epic. The colours, the music, it just becomes so much better. Now the things that didn't work for me. The beginning, I just don't enjoy it. All the cutesy stuff is too much and really drags on for me. The animation is still fairly good, but I just can't enjoy the characters as much. But it does has its moments, like when Bambi's mom first enters the meadow, the suspense just builds to an incredible amount and the animation on her copies a deer's movements down to the bone. All in all the beginning has its moments that tie it together well enough, but it's the second half that makes the movie. I loved it as a kid and I still love it now, it is near perfect."
118,Bambi,8,10 January 2012,"A great, timeless Film","Bambi came out in 1942, yet if I didn't know that, I might say that it came out some time in the eighties. The animation is absolutely beautiful, the plot is a simple coming of age story, and all the songs and jokes are timeless.The characters are all extremely likable. And then of course there is that one scene that everyone remembers when Bambi's mother is shot. What I like is that we don't see much, we don't see the mom's corpse, no blood, or the hunter's face.Bambi is not my favorite Disney animated movie, but it is one of my favorites. The characters are great, the story is timeless, the jokes are funny, the drama scenes are actually dramatic, and the animation is absolutely beautiful."
119,Bambi,7,5 July 2010,"""The Circle of Life""...50 years before ""Lion King""....","I especially love this period of animation, although it is obvious that in this, the fourth feature length offering from Disney, that things were in a constant state of flux ( did I say that??)in the world of animation. I never saw Bambi or many of the other Disney offerings as a child in their full form because it simply was not mainstream. On the TV show, excerpts were the best Disney could do, the obvious reason being time constraints. So...I find myself catching up with lots of things that I missed coming up. Some are worth the effort...some not. I do not find myself especially crazy about Disney works and features...largely because Disney hired other folks to do the work and simply put his name on it. It's been tough to do a mental end-run around that, and I have been inclined to focus more upon the guys who actually did the work. But I guess a cerebral compromise is that, possibly with the exception of Ub Iwerks, many of these great animators and artists might not have gotten any exposure had it not been for Disney, and he did generously name the responsible artists...and, more than a few have gone on to make their mark in the animation world, though none..or very few...made a mark as profound as Disney's, since it was his idea to produce the first feature length animation. With that cathartic overture out of the way, I can now get to the heart of the matter. Bambi is one of the few Disney efforts that fall just shy of being something of an ""art-house"" film. Multi-plane camera technique was nothing new at this point...the Fleischers had used it throughout the 30s to great effect in their short subjects...but what differentiates Bambi from the Fleischer efforts is the detailed realism, and the attention to detail for movements and backgrounds. And , of course, there is the heart-rendering character, Bambi, born into the wilderness as a ""Prince"". The fact that his father is the ""Great Prince"" is largely under-played, but we discover this about Bambi after his mother is shot and killed by ""man"", the enemy of the wilderness and of its inhabitants. The ""Great Prince"" takes his ""son"" under his wing and sees him through to his adult ""manhood"". Bambi's life is predictable, and he meets his challenges with great fortitude, especially in his quest for a mate in the form of the female fawn ( now adult deer) Faline. His battle for her is successful, though Bambi has to reach inside of himself to gather strength and determination to vanquish his opposition. In many ways, the story of Bambi is a prequel to ""The Lion King"", which would come over half-a-century later. The progeny of animal royalty is born, is nurtured, and--at the appropriate time, he takes his proper place among the inhabitants. The main difference in the two stories is, of course, that in ""Lion King"", the rightful heir to the place of high respect is denied the main character, by quirks of fate. Once the main character realizes who he is and what his proper inheritance is, it then becomes a matter of fighting it out in order to settle it. Bambi ends in a similar fashion to ""Lion King"" in that Bambi is now well on his way to attaining the status of the ""Great Prince"", and has produced progeny of his own to carry on after he is gone. It is a life story...and, despite technical advances in animation--and in life--the story of life remains the same. We are born, we do what we are put here to do...and then we pass on. Bambi is well worth the watch, not just because of the evolving animation techniques, but it is a story of life, true to form, and told from the viewpoint of the inhabitants of the forest."
120,Bambi,10,1 September 2008,More animation,"The reviewer (Spleen) was wrong when he said that Disney did not make another full-length animated feature until 1950. Well, he's wrong! Disney came out with ""Saludos Amigos"" (1942, though barely a feature at 40 minutes); ""The Three Caballeros"" (1944) and ""Make Mine Music"" (1946). These were all original films, with Caballeros being the wildest animated film I believe Disney ever did! ""Bambi"" is indeed a classic, although the DVD I have promised ""All-New Disney Enhanced Home Theatre Mix"". I did not hear this Home Theatre Mix, try as I might. The stereo was just fine, though. However, the restoration was gorgeous, and the extras complement the film. Hats off to that team!"
121,Bambi,10,9 August 2007,Bambi great movie,"I think it's a great movie it's very emotional but I can watch it over and over again i almost cry in this movie but all in all i will always give it the highest vote possible both one and two buy the way this is possibly the best animated movie ever the only movie i can ""feel"" and ill say it's the best iv seen yet.(WARNING SPOILER BELOW):the saddest part is when his mom dies and in the sequel when he almost dies and I think that he almost died thrice (three times) funny parts in the first movie when friend owl tries to sleep and the birds wake him up oh and when Bambi shakes the tree hes standing on and he thinks there's more than one and he says ""get out a here all of ya and you too"""
122,Bambi,10,27 March 2006,Cute Movie,"This is one of the best movies of ALL TIME! I love the cute voices of Bambi, Flower, and Thumper. This is currently on my Top 30 Favoite movies! WARNING!!! ***Spoilers ahead*** Bambi is a cute, adorable movie about a deer who is born in the forest. He makes friends with Thumper, a funny bunny who's father always taught him well. Later, Bambi's mother is killed by humans, who we never see. His father brings him up (watch Bambi II for details). He meets Feline, a friend from his youth. There is a weird ""dream"" scene, but it's not very easy to describe. Watch the movie with popcorn! And soda while you're at it.My Score: 10/10."
123,Bambi,10,8 March 2006,What a beautiful film,"A true classic.Still beautiful to look at.I just love the Thumper character! What a fun role.Good, but not outstanding music for this Disney film.The scene with Thumper & Bambi on the ice is great. Frank Thomas out did himself with this scene.I remember Frank & Ollie talking about the scene of Bambi's mother dying.Flower is a cute character.Voice talent on the film is perfect.The scenes where Thumper's mother has to remind him of things his father told him. The look they put on the characters face is wonderful.""Eating greens is a special treat"". Would you not but agree with Thumper in his view on the subject?The story of the young Prince stands up to this day.Classic, beautiful film."
124,Bambi,10,1 March 2006,Beautiful...truly beautiful,"When I was the age of 6 my parents bought me and my sister the Bambi video for us to watch. We sat enchanted evening after evening and I remember crying at Bambi's mother's death (my mum was too!). Now at the age of 14 I watched it the other day and I was stunned by the quality of the drawings and the dealing with real-life situations. The film is really quite dark as well. It is a million times better than the computer generated films that come out every five seconds (*ahem* Finding Nemo*ahem*). So in my opinion this an absolute classic and something everyone, whether you are a cynical teenager, grumpy old person or middle-aged mum, should watch"
125,Bambi,10,15 February 2006,Nice film,"I had this film in a tape in the Summer of 1982 and I was all day listening it, when I ate melon I enjoyed saying that Thumper's phrase when they are eating grass and flowers ""No no, the green no, only the white, that's the most good"", I loved it very much and in 1995 in my house we had the film in videotape and one day we watched it and I watched it for remembering. All the Summer listening the tape but when the Summer ended one day that I was in my chalet after we went to my grandparents' house and there accidentally it fell to me through the window of the house, of my grandparents' room, now only is alive my grandmother, my grandfather died a long ago, in 1987 after being sick a long time."
126,Bambi,7,5 January 2006,the best of all the animated films,"this was my favourite film as a child and i watched it over and over again then.. it's still one of my favourites and i reckon it's the best of the classic Disney animated films.. the music just evokes so much emotion and my favourite bit is when Bambi roams in the woods with Faline, coz it just makes ya wished ya found the girl u're meant to be with.. the characters, scenes are drawn so beautifully, u wish they'd go back to that classical style again once in a while coz it's just so beautiful.. what is so memorable is the way the transition of the seasons is depicted, from the birth of Bambi in the spring, and then being in the meadow in the summer, the leaves falling in autumn, the struggles through the cold of winter, finding love in spring..i wish they'd revert back to this classical format of animation coz u do get sick of the CGI based animated films of the present which really tend to focus more on the CGI rather than the story itself.. whilst there have been some great ones like Shrek, Chicken Run, Toy Story, A Bugs Life, i find the others have been just monotonous.. and really nothing like this classic..watch Bambi if ya wanna have shed a little tear abt youth.. or finding love.. or the beauty of life.."
127,Bambi,10,30 November 2005,a flawless classic,"I remember watching this movie as a kid but watching it now at 19 years old on DVD really did change my opinion on this movie.most people my age that i have talked to really prefer movies from today and really stick up their nose at our old classics which have a sort of ""been there done that"" kind of sense to them in most people's opinions. this quickly became one of my favorite movies in a matter of seconds due to the nature and theme that Disney attempted and successfully portrayed.i have to say that one of the reasons i love this movie so much is the music. watching the making of this movie, it was really cool to see how serious they were about the music and all for the better since the music is just one of the best scores i've heard."
128,Bambi,9,20 June 2005,Bambi,"I didn't realise it had been almost eighteen years since I last saw this most recommended Disney cartoon, so when I could find it I decided it was time to see it once again. Basically this is the story of a young deer named Bambi, hailed as the Prince of the Forest, seeing his life through all four seasons going from doe to adolescent, essentially The Circle of Life, before The Lion King. So Bambiis born in the spring in the thicket with his mother and all forest animals onlooking, and in the summer he learns to walk and talk with the help of his friend Thumper the rabbit and a skunk he call Flower, and he sees the meadow where he meets Faline the young female deer. In the autumn Bambi and mother experience a rainfall, then the winter sets in for a snowfall where Bambi and Thumper skate on the pond, and then tragedy occurs when you hear his mother shot by Man. Years later, Bambi, Thumper and Flower have grown up, and Friend Owl warns them that they could become ""twitterpated"", i.e. fall in love without warning, and that is exactly what happens, Bambi is reunited with also grown up Faline. There is a rivalry between Bambi and other male buck Ronno, but in a rutting match Bambi defeats him and he and Faline become a couple, and they continue their flirting and dancing in the woods. Danger sets in however when Man causes a forest fire, Bambi and his father help Faline escape attack dogs, and then they flee the fire over waterfall and onto a small island. The film ends with springtime once again, all the animals of the wood gather at the thicket, and Faline reveals her own two does, with Bambi and his father proudly looking from above. Everyone remembers the mother being killed off screen, it was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, it is the iconic scene of the film, but besides this my most memorable scene was the nice song ""Little April Shower"". The characters that don't need to talk too much are cute, the music is magnificent to take through all moods of the picture, and the animation for the animals and wood landscapes is outstanding quality, a must see animation. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for ""Love Is a Song"", Best Music for Frank Churchill and Edward H. Plumb, and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe Special Award for Walt Disney. Man was number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 72 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!"
129,Bambi,10,29 June 2000,A prize buck indeed!,"Wow, watching this movie after having seen a lot of Disney's recent features is a very dramatic change in tone!  It's very relaxed and subdued, compared to the movies of today.  For some reason, Disney now thinks that an animated film can't be good if it isn't all nonstop action, which is too bad.The film's relaxing tone is so effective that (and I guess this isn't really a spoiler as it's the only part of the movie anybody seems to talk about) the death of Bambi's mom is that much more of a shock.  It's unfair, but I think the scene is very well done, as the movie doesn't make a big huge deal about it.  To see what I mean, compare this scene with it's parallel in ""the Lion King"" (I think we can all agree that the way they handled Mufasa's death is a *little* much).So, please, don't reject the movie because ""it's too sad"".  It's a beautiful love letter to the great outdoors.  And of course you have the hilarious courtship scene with Thumper."
130,Bambi,,17 November 1998,Disney's best,"Timeless and classic, this is a great story about growing up.  The beginning is very innocent and light hearted, as is childhood and the second half is more serious in tone, just as being an adult.  A perfect film from start to finish.  Drama is perfectly balanced with comedy, tears are balanced with laughter.  Beautifully drawn, it's no wonder that Bambi was Walt Disney's favorite film."
131,Bambi,2,5 December 2012,I think it's overrated.,"A lot of adults seem to really love this movie. I wonder what the appeal is. All they can say is ""the animation is amazing. The rain drops were all done by hand."" That's it. That's all they can say. I will admit a lot of the animation is very good. The backgrounds and (of course) the rain drops. The way the characters are designed does nothing for me. The way they are drawn is really ugly, and their personalities are dull and cutesy. I guess Thumper has some character because he's kinda bratty. But everyone else is just bland. I just can't see an adult actually enjoying this, but they do. Why? I don't know. I can see a young child 7 and under liking it. In fact, I actually did like it as a kid. As an adult, I wanted to puke at how sugary sweet it is. I would give this movie one star, but I decided to be fair. Extra star for the scenery. That was the only part I actually enjoyed. A lot of fans will hate reading this review. I will defend myself by saying this. It's only my opinion and I wasn't vague. I gave a logical reason why I hate this movie."
132,Bambi,10,28 February 2005,sad remastering of a classic,i don't understand why they have to spoil things by digitally remastering them.it is so sad to have the subtleties removed and make this movie into a brightly colored modern looking one.i am saddened but this still remains one of the best of all time.do you think they will release an untouched version to get more money from us? and horror of horrors they have made a sequelwhat next snow whites divorce? or maybe dumbo flees the circus. OK the peter pan one was OK jungle book a rehash. no where were they as good as the originals. i suppose Disney id now just a cash cowwhy do they have to spoil everything?
133,Bambi,6,16 April 2002,"Too, too sad","Why do so many kids' movies have to be heartbreaking? I remember crying my eyes out back in the seventies when I heard Bambi's plaintive cry, ""Mother?! Mother?!"" I'm a bit embarrassed to tell you that I fast forward through that part when my kids watch! The rest of the movie is great, but I'll never be able to get over the heartbreak of the hunt."
134,Bambi,6,13 May 2009,Only You Can Prevent Childhood Trauma...,"I've got to hand it to Disney for consistently managing to scare the wits out of me in just about every single movie until I was 13 (and there are still some that I skip scenes on.) However, they completely outdid themselves with this film. It's all very deceptively packaged in layers of happy woodland romps, but beware: this is the stuff nightmares are made of! Every trip to that freaking meadow ends in disaster, Mommy dearest gets a buckshot in the ultimate irony after finding the grass that will save them from starvation, mad dogs tear up the screen, evil bucks go crazy-horny-jealous, the freaking theme of man haunts you around every corner and then the forest burns to PIECES! But the absolutely most gut-wrenching scene I have ever witnessed in any movie EVER is when that poor pheasant goes batty about not flying from her hideout and the music is so tense you just end up screaming at the top of your lungs at the screen. I don't recall ever making it through the movie without bawling my eyes out.OK, so I do find the film terrifying and I have my doubts if I would ever subject a young child to it, but it is not without its merits. There is plenty of action and yes, dramatic tension. You feel for the characters with every step of the never-ending cycle of tragedy that is life. And yet, there are happy times. Simple scenes of happiness and humor. But ohhh, that darkness never is far behind, and for that reason I give it a high-ulcer rating, which just isn't something I like to subject myself to on a regular basis.Quote of the Film: Don't Fly! Whatever you do, don't fly!"
135,Bambi,8,1 September 2015,Good in its day but they cut bits out in modern releases,"We all love the story of Bambi with her friend thumper. The animation was good, the story a beautiful one, it still brings tears to my eyes and makes me cry. But I recently bought the ""Updated"" 2 Disc release with Babmi 2, but for some reason it seems like they have cut out some of the scenes. Why oh why did they do this? I love the film its still worth watching, but simply for the reason that they took out these scenes I couldn't rate it higher than an 8. Love the film, but bring back our scenes! If you have never seen it you really should, but find an original and not this version."
136,Bambi,7,10 April 2015,Classic Disney tearjerker,"(68%) One of Disney's better remembered early classics plays very much a similar note to one of their more recent classics ""The lion king"", as the circle of life is the overriding theme here. Although this is much more of a simple plotted watch in which tells its basic, yet captivating tale of nature against the odds placed by man. Some have tamely attacked the negative depiction of man as being too simplistic, too black and white; but the fact remains this is very much taken from the view of a wild deer so how else exactly can man be shown as anything other than a cold killer with a smoking gun is hard to imagine. This isn't one of my top pick Disney outings as I favour their more light-heated features, but I will admit that the animation is fantastic and it has aged very well over the decades becoming more than a little bit timeless."
137,Bambi,1,3 March 2011,Blu-Ray Diamond Edition,"I am reviewing strictly based on the Diamond Edition released this year. My reasons are valid as you will see. I am a huge fan of the classic Disney movies and I feel that the latest release of this movie is shameful. It looks like a 3 year old child traced over everything. You can easily see the new lines placed over the old and now blurry original lines. You would get this same result if you took for example a small image and then enlarged it to a high resolution and tried to trace some detail back into the lines. A very amateur way to ""enhance"" anything.I am so disappointed with this. I could probably write a 10 page article pointing out all the flaws with it. I do understand that this movie is ancient however I also design graphics and know what good work looks like. I also understand that this took minimal effort to accomplish and it shows in the finished product. I actually prefer the older release on standard DVD up scaled to 1080 over this version which was shabbily tossed together on in this format."
