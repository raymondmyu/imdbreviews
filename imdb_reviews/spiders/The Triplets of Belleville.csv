0,The Triplets of Belleville,8,21 February 2005,What does it all mean?,"Yesterday evening a friend introduced me to this extraordinary piece of animation. After watching it I was left with the feeling that I'd just watched a film which communicated something to me, but I wasn't quite sure what that might be. For hours afterward I thought to myself, ""Why did that film appeal to me so?"" The story is simple and straightforward. The details are charming and nuanced. The rendering is a true tour-de-force. The one thing that caught my eye was the sheen of the water as Mme. Souza and Bruno are crossing the ocean in pursuit of her grandson. I can hardly believe that was animation. Then I noticed the play of the light on the water reflected against the hulls of the boats at dock in the harbor. My friend pointed out the skill of the graphic designers in maintaining the proper camera angles of the projected live film footage on the screen during the chase sequence.The music is absolutely captivating. Everything from the opening dance-hall sequence to the extraordinary use of the Kyrie from Mozart's Mass in C Minor during the storm at sea and the entrance into the harbor of Belleville. Notice how the music builds in richness as the camera descends from the few spires at the beginning of the sequence to the dense mass at street level.Remembering the details and how they relate to each other and the film as a whole keeps you thinking about the significance of the film's contents. For instance, I only now remember that the opening sequence was drawn in the archaic, fluid style of early cartoon animation (Steamboat Willy, Olive Oyl and Popeye) because, of course, it was depicting events which predated the time of the film proper. The style served a purpose, beyond being an end in itself.For a long time after watching the film I remained puzzled about its appeal to me. I've seen a large number of animated feature films, but none have left me quite as reflective as did this one. I was less concerned with the meaning of the details. It is a cartoon, after all.I continued to wonder about Madame Souza's expression. About how the creator was able to invest such meaning in those simple dark circles set behind thick lenses and the line of her mouth, which modulated between forthright resolve and a gentle satisfaction. Then it occurred to me. Beyond the larger outline of the story and the details in which it is couched, it tells us of the power of one person's love and concern for another. I suppose we all wish we could receive such unconditional love, and it makes us feel warm to think that such a thing could actually be. Even if only in a cartoon.The film either will or will not appeal to you, depending on what it is you're looking for in an animated feature film. I watched it without expectations, and was left wondering, ""Why does it resonate with me?"" And you'll want to see it again."
1,The Triplets of Belleville,8,4 October 2004,Unusual and delightful,"Rarely am I riveted by animated cinema that isn't good Japanese Anime, but 'The Triplets of Belleville' had my eyes glued to the screen from the beginning. The story is quite simple: A grandmother tries to make her young grandson (who is living with her) happy, and discovers his fascination for bicycles, so she buys him one. Cut to years later, and he is now a contender for the Tour de France, with his grandmother still doting on him, now acting as his trainer. During the race itself he and other riders are kidnapped and taken to Belleville, so the grandmother and their enormously fat dog go looking for him. Without money or shelter, the two are discovered by three old women, former famous vaudevillians  The Triplets of Belleville. They invite her and the dog in to stay and help her attempt to rescue her grandson.'The Triplets of Belleville' is wonderfully unusual in many ways. Firstly, the character design by director Sylvain Chomet is abstract and garish. Most characters are extremely ugly, and almost every citizen of Belleville other than the primaries are grotesquely obese. (Even the Statue of Liberty in Belleville's harbor is ridiculously fat) The goons who kidnap the grandson are hilarious in their design  they have tall, completely square shoulders and at times morph together. The cyclists have half inch waists, agonized faces and enormous leg muscles. Also, there is almost no dialogue during the 81 minute film. There are a couple of songs, (the music in 'Belleville' is great) but other than some incidental sounds, there is maybe a couple of lines of actual dialogue. This serves as definitive proof that the film was brilliantly told through the action and animation.To be sure, 'The Triplets of Belleville' is not for everyone. It is probably the antithesis of Disney or Pixar in its abstractness, intelligence and design. Not to say that the others are not intelligent, most aren't, but films like 'Finding Nemo' rely on pop culture to convey their wit, whereas 'The Triplets of Belleville' is brilliantly compelling with a handful of words. A strong 8/10.--Shelly"
2,The Triplets of Belleville,,29 February 2004,Brilliant,"From the moment I pressed play on the DVD remote, the whole family was transfixed by this wonderful movie. It was so good, that we immediately watched it again. So what was so good about it? Well, firstly Bruno has to be the best dog (either animated or live) in any movie. The subtle observation of its daily routines are among my favourite scenes. Second, the humour is refreshingly dark and constantly surprising (it's not too far removed from Gary Larson's The Far Side). The scene showing the expansion of Paris to convey the passing of time had us in hysterics. Thirdly, it's just so imaginative. Everything is exaggerated beyond belief. If you like your animation to have a touch of realism, then stay away. In Belleville, things are grotesquely exaggerated. I've noticed a few negative comments about this film, which raises the question of who is going to like it and who isn't. I guess the fairest comment I can make is to say that this probably isn't mainstream stuff. If your favourite movies are summer blockbusters, then maybe this isn't for you. If, on the other hand, you like discovering quiet gems from time to time, stumbling across something a little different on a cable channel, then this could be just what you're looking for."
3,The Triplets of Belleville,10,5 November 2004,"Pixar yes, but here's OTHER Animation","What a wonderful gem of work this is, and I am glad that it was done RECENTLY.In a time when Pixar is setting the standard for ""animation"", here comes a film that makes you remember why you liked animation in the first place. This is a wonderful technique film, a study of art film, an abstract film, a joy to watch. The story might be a bit complicated for most to keep up but the beauty of it is - it's complexity. The grandmother was wonderful as well as the dog and the cyclist -- but what blew me away was the overdrawn charatures of the characters.And there will be no more ""frogs"" for me, ladies! :)A deserved USA Oscar nomination. In a Pixar world, bring on more like these to keep the balance too!"
4,The Triplets of Belleville,,20 August 2004,intriguing animated film,"'The Triplets of Belleville' is a strange, largely wordless animated feature by French filmmaker Sylvain Chomet. It tells the story of a sad and lonely young boy whose sweet and doting grandmother buys him a bicycle in the hopes that it will bring a sense of purpose to his life. It does, for as the years pass, the lad grows to become a competitive cyclist, thanks in large part to the tender encouragement and ministrations of this adoring, and, one must say, adorable woman. While he's taking part in the Tour de France, some Mafia henchmen kidnap the boy so they can use him for a bizarre and deadly gambling scheme. The majority of the film recounts the attempts by his intrepid grandmother and his unflaggingly loyal dog to track the youngster down and rescue him. Aiding them in this endeavor are the Triplets of Belleville, a trio of aging nightclub singers with some bizarrely French eating habits whom they encounter on their way.Because the film employs almost no dialogue or voice-over narration, it is left mainly to the visuals to convey the storyline. For this purpose, Chomet relies almost exclusively on facial expressions and body language to spell out the major plot points. The film's unique look arises from its gross distortion of shape, line and form, particularly in regards to the human figures. The thin characters are spindly and angular almost to grotesqueness, while those who are overweight run to a corpulence of awe-inspiring proportions. And the Mafia figures bring new meaning to the term 'broad-shouldered.' But it isn't just the humans. The thin, needle-like skyscrapers rise to impossible heights, while an ocean liner's hull is stretched vertically to such an extent that we expect the ship to capsize from its preposterously un-seaworthy design at any moment. The film is filled with moments of great imagination, as when it visualizes the black-and-white dreams of an aging dog, or when it turns the tables and shows us three cartoon characters laughing it up while watching some 'live action' characters on TV indulging in inane slapstick madness. Like all fine animated films, 'The Triplets of Belleville' creates its own unique world, filled with images and sights we've never quite seen before. By eliminating speech as a means of storytelling, the filmmaker heightens the surrealistic tone of what is being shown on screen.'The Triplets of Bellville' isn't a great film, but its uniqueness of vision and form makes it one well worth watching."
5,The Triplets of Belleville,10,1 January 2004,the best neo-surrealistic animation I've seen since The Wall- a unique movie-going experience,"Within the first five minutes of The Triplets of Belleville I knew I was about to see either one of the worst films of the year, or one of the best- writer/director Sylvain Chomet and art director/designer Evgnei Tomov have created a (animated) world in which they seem to be in love with every frame, every image, every musical note, and at first there is that sense that this is an off-putting style.  But soon I realized that what Chomet and Tomov were doing was much like what Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali did with their classic Un Chien Andalou.  The story is not incomprehensible because it's simple enough so that a child could follow along, and the strategy thus is to tell it with an artistic, intense, mad-cap, whatever you can think to call it, personalized view on the characters and the environments they get themselves into.  That the film is from France adds a charm once the elements get skewed (the animators tackle the Tour de France, big cities, ocean-liners, singers, frogs, and the gangster underworld), and that it doesn't have- and doesn't need- subtitles to tell the story is another remarkable feat.As the film reached into the last act, I then realized two things- 1) this is one of those films, like Un Chien Andalou and The Wall (the great Gerald Scarfe's influence was one that I guessed, though there's probably more I didn't catch on), that won't appeal to everyone.  Those expecting a cute French animated film can expect that, however a movie-goer needs to have an open mind to the material, and that the term ""cute"" would be taken for granted while being immersed in this film.  2) since the film is made like an original, without much compromise to where the story has to be headed or which characters do and say what, at the least The Triplets of Belleville works superbly to create an overwhelming state of mind for the viewer. Personally, I get exhilarated watching a movie where I don't even WANT to expect where the story is headed.  Throughout most of the 80 minutes I felt an un-canny faith in the filmmakers that their oddball, free-wheeling visions wouldn't go up in smoke.  And by the end I left wanting more for some reason or another.  Like I said, some might be turned sour by the execution of the material, yet for others the fantasy-like nature of The Triplets of Belleville should make for an interesting night-out.  For one thing, you won't get those frogs out of your mind very easily.  A+"
6,The Triplets of Belleville,8,14 June 2005,"Original, Impressive and Very Bizarre","Madame Souza raises her grandson Champion and tries to make him happier with a baby dog, Bruno. However, the boy remains sad, and the grandmother gives a tricycle for him. The boy gets excited with the gift, and trained by Madame Souza along the years, he finally competes the Tour de France. When Champion is kidnapped by two MIBs from the French mafia, Madame Souza and Bruno travel to Belleville to rescue him, with the support of the elder singers, the Belleville Sisters.What a wonderful surprise ""Les Triplettes de Belleville"" is! An original, impressive and very bizarre dark story, that recalls the style of Tim Burton, supported by an amazing music score. The scene on the sea, while playing Mozart's Mass in C Minor, is fantastic and maybe my favorite. The city of Belleville, visibly inspired in New York, with a fat Statue of Liberty, is impressive. The intentional exxageration in the proportions of the ships and sky-scrapers is amazing and stylish. The grotesque and ugly characters are very unusual for heroes and even villains, and this movie is basically the opposite of the animations of Pixar and Disney. Madame Souza has a shorter leg; Champion has deformed legs and long nose; Bruno is horribly fat; the MIBs are plane; their boss is very short; the old singers look like witches; in common, all of them are very ugly. I really recommend this movie for viewers that aim to see a fresh idea of animation, with dark comedy and weird adventure. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""As Bicicletas de Belleville"" (""The Bicycles of Belleville"")"
7,The Triplets of Belleville,8,7 March 2006,A Very Different Kind Of Animated Film,"Here's another film that is quite different from anything you've seen. It animated French film, and this unique artwork is really something to see - astounding in parts. Audibly, it's also unique as there is almost no dialog in here.The strange story is a simple one: a mother and the family dog go after people who kidnap her son. That doesn't begin to explain the weirdness, however. The son is a great Tour de France cyclist who, along with two other races, is kidnapped and taken to New York City (Belleville). The mother and dog follow and are taken in by three eccentric old singers who eat frogs (I told you it gets weird.). Then, they discover where the son is and the chase is on. The ending, frankly, gets carried away and is the only part of the story that didn't really seem to fit in. It was just too plain stupid and clichéd, dumbing a clever film down..With almost no dialog, it would be easy to bore the audience but the artwork is so good and the story is told so well with a lot of humor, that it keeps your interest and would be fun to watch a number of times."
8,The Triplets of Belleville,10,10 January 2007,Triumph of the Retro,"If you love the style of the old Chuck Jones cartoons, or the Pink Panther, you'll definitely love this movie. If not, you may love it all the same. The animated characters are entertainingly  and artistically  grotesque, with understated emotions. They say it all with a barely noticeable shift of the eye or by fixing their glasses, or just by staring ahead. And yet understatement is the characters' chief strength, and for once we have an animated film that doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. Call it retro if you like, but it is very effective.Machines and houses can be just as grotesque as people in this movie: ships that look like they should rightly sink into the water like a knife, houses arched back subserviently under pressure from elevated railways, and a fat Statue of Liberty (just a hint as to how Americans are treated in this movie  but it is done without any malice). Nothing makes sense when viewed individually, and yet together it meshes into a true masterpiece of form and content.The storyline is very simple: a French bicycle racer is being kidnapped by the French Mafia to be used for illegal gambling, leaving his grandmother to try and rescue him. Along the way she teams up with the aging Triplets of Belleville, who, no longer at the heights of their power, still have a trick or two up their sleeve.But if all you're after in a movie is a strong story, you might be disappointed. The accent here is on superb animation and soundtrack, which creates a feast for the eye and ear (speaking of ears, it will be a while before you'd be able to get that tune out of your head). This makes the movie watchable more than once  you will only enjoy it more on subsequent viewings.Bruno the dog also deserves a special mention: though grotesquely fat, it is probably the most true-to-life and well-developed depiction of a dog in any movie, filmed or animated. No cutesy stuff here, just real ""dogginess."" His dreams are especially interesting and add a surrealistic dimension to an already part-surrealistic production.This movie should be a household name. Pity we're not more open to foreign films: most of us keep missing out on masterpieces like this."
9,The Triplets of Belleville,10,22 August 2004,Just Great,"I found ""The Triplets of Belleville"" to be one of the most charming movies I've had the pleasure of seeing the last couple of years.  This delightful movie follows the adventures of Madame Souza, her son, Champion, and their dog, Bruno.  Madame Souza recognizes that something is missing from Champion's life.  His parents are, clearly, gone.  All he has left from them is a picture of the pair of them on a bicycle.  As she silently pieces together what Champion needs to be happy, she and he discover a new life as participants in the Tour de France - he as a competitor and her as his coach and trainer.They live a life of quiet, simple joys until he is kidnapped, an event that leads to a trip to Belleville for all three.  This fictional city will prove oddly familiar to most viewers.  Here, Madame Souza is befriended by the titular characters - I will leave the ""book report"" style commenting here.There are so many delights in this picture, but I am going to focus on my favorite character, Bruno the dog.  I don't think I have ever seen a movie capture a real dog as well as this one does.  We see him from a puppy, learn the event that leads him to hate trains, feel anxious for him when he paws at his bowl while the silly humans finish their own dinners, and fear for him when his canine instincts lead him to places of danger. 
Throughout this all, Bruno is gloriously canine.  He dreams of the things that are important to him, he sees the world as smells and images.  He is awesome.  Or, perhaps, she is awesome.  Bruno is a male name, but many have suggested he is a she.Anyhow, the other characters are great fun as well, but my heart belongs to this big fat dog.  Even if I hadn't loved the rest of the movie (I did), I would recomend it for Bruno alone."
10,The Triplets of Belleville,10,12 April 2005,I LOVED this movie!,"When I saw ""The Triplettes of Bellville"" on display at my video store I had never heard anything about it, so I had no idea what to expect. I chose it because to me, it looked bizarre- (which I love) and when I saw it was French it made me grab it right away. There was a show I used to watch called ""OH CANADA"" that had French / Canadian cartoons which were the most bizarre and enjoyable cartoons I had ever seen. They only showed it late at night because they weren't your typical cartoons, and more for adults than children. I was hoping Triplettes of Bellville would be something like that, and I was more than pleasantly surprised when I watched it. The first 5 minutes had me rolling with laughter and telling my partner ""SEE! Isn't this great?!!"" (He wasn't too sure of why I chose a cartoon for us to watch, but I kept telling him it would be good.) We both loved it, and commented how freaky and weird it was. It had many layers to it, and is one of those movies that I am sure the more you watch it, the more things you will see that you missed. I really loved the hidden meanings and psychological depth it had. For example, the part where we get to see a dog's dream...we were like ""Woah- I bet that IS what dogs dream about!!!"" I am determined to buy this movie, which I very rarely buy movies because they seem to lose their charm after you own them. I have already planned for my 3 sisters and I to get together just to watch this movie. I liked it so much that I am writing a review! (something I have never done!) I was a little upset when I heard that people were criticizing it, but then again, I have to expect that. It isn't the typical movie you would see in the theaters at any given time- but then again, that is EXACTLY why I loved it!!! So, if you love movies that are bizarre, different, and can take on many meanings, Triplettes of Bellville is the one to watch! I have been telling everyone I know to go see it!"
11,The Triplets of Belleville,10,20 May 2004,Should Put Disney Out of Its Misery,"This feature animation puts Disney to shame for all its brain-dead, middle-of-the-road, theme park-oriented, schmaltzy, claptrap nonsense that's popular with the masses in this world. Beyond the fact that this animation is all of stunning, beautiful, thought-provoking, funny, artistic and frightening enough to make anyone with talent doubt their worth, ""Les Triplettes de Belleville"" happily refuses to assault its audience with mind-numbing, cloying, useless, overrated, saccharin, and trashy music and songs by the likes of Elton John and Andrew Lloyd Weber. (How's that for hyphenating) It achieves as much as, if not more than, what Jacques Tati could do with real actors. It should make anyone who ever thought a stuffed animal or ""Happy Birthday"" balloons was tasteful, crawl into a corner where they belong."
12,The Triplets of Belleville,10,18 March 2006,"Charming, beautiful and funny","I really love this movie. I might be biased; I like art and techniques behind the art, and this movie is a roller-coaster of visual wonders and sublimely mixed old-style hand-drawn cartoons and CGI. But apart from it's amazing visuals, this movie has what many cartoons lack today: soul.The quirky and caricature-ic characters are beautifully and lovingly sculpted and brings a smile to my face. The story is pretty simple but the pace is perfect and ensures that there are no slow moments and no over-rushed ones.""Belleville"" is one of the sweetest cartoons I've seen in many years. It reminds you of being a child, but it still has qualities which makes it worth watching as a grown-up.Missing this movie is not to be recommended. The film-makers were obviously doing it for fun and their love and compassion shine throughout the movie. It might feel odd to watch a movie with so little dialog, but you get used to it quickly and I think more dialog would have ruined the nice mood and the perfect use of sound effects.The best French cartoon I've ever seen, and one of the best overall. 10/10."
13,The Triplets of Belleville,,2 February 2004,Sublime vileness,"This stranger-than-usual animation is an ornate, intriguing piece of work, with a unique visual style somewhat resembling certain English cartoonists' (Ronald Searle's, for example) but very remote indeed from either Disney or South Park or Japanese anime.  There are times as you watch, especially at first, before the repetition and the overkill of intricate detail begin to pall, when the originality and visual richness clearly approach the sublime. The combination of computer and traditional hand animation methods, carried out at such a level of complexity that the film required five years to complete, is an unquestionable triumph. But you may very well be put off when you realize that overall Sylvain Chomet's first full-length animated film has no discernible point or message; that its central figures are mournful, ugly, and unfriendly; that there is little plot, virtually no dialogue, and that the void left thereby is filled with a great deal of annoying noise and repulsive imagery.  The twittering visual machinery of wiggling, yapping, howling dogs, of awkward, caricatured creatures of all sorts endlessly in motion, turns into a series of nightmarish repetitions that can easily become as off-putting as they are wearying.I wanted to like this movie.  Its originality and adeptness as a work of animation remain impressive. It gives new meaning to the very word `animation':  every scene is a study of the nature and arts of motion. There are observations whose keenness is unique.  As cultural commentary it certainly provides much material for debate. The vision of France a half century ago is quaint and intriguing.  But the mournfulness, the sadomasochistic undertones, and the meanness build over time; and when the triplets dined on plates and pots full of still squirming frogs, my sympathies checked out.  The undercurrents of nastiness both in the personalities of the principals and the depiction of American culture do not leave an endearing impression.The plot is simple and can be seen as little more than a rough framework on which to hang the intricate doodlings, the recreation of a grotesque nostalgic vision of postwar France, and the endless experiments with the very nature of animation, which are perhaps ultimately the film's real point. An old French granny, Madame Souza, whose walk clatters from a big orthopedic shoe, lives in a rickety house somewhere in Fifties Paris or its environs.  She has in her care a large dog, Bruno, and a large, lean, boy, Champion, her orphaned grandson, who dreams of racing in the Tour de France. She herself ruthlessly supervises his training, which is shown in meticulous detail and includes, at home, the use of a variety of Rube Goldberg contraptions to feed and condition him after he has returned from his exhausting day on the roads. Champion grows up with grotesquely hypertrophied leg muscles and tiny upper body, and competes as planned in the Tour de France.  But during the race he's kidnapped by sinister box-shaped gangsters and taken to the city of Belleville, over in the new world.  Madame de Souza and Bruno set out in pursuit, crossing the sea in a boat, complete with dramatic storm. Once in Belleville, a blatantly anti-American vision of New York perhaps including elements of Montreal (the inhabitants and even the Statue of Liberty are grossly fat), old granny makes the acquaintance of a trio of eccentric and fleshy former women vaudeville singers (whom we've seen do their scat-singing act on an ancient TV broadcast) and these `Triplettes de Belleville' help Madame recapture Champion from the kidnappers.  One writer has suggested the plot is an allegory of how Hollywood steals the best European talents and sucks them dry. If so, the theft is foiled this time.No movie has ever shown the curious way big cumbersome dogs can manage to get up on a bed with somebody already lying in it.  This trick is shown several times.  It remains one of the keenest pieces of observation I've ever seen in an animation.  The intricacy of detail of Champion's training process is hard to get out of one's head; the depiction of a grueling, relentless exercise routine is unforgettable.  Others will like moments like the great storm at sea, though the effects used there seemed to me out of sync with the more linear style of the rest.  A momentary TV appearance of what is obviously Glenn Gould intricately nattering away at some Bach keyboard fugue, no doubt beamed to France from the Canadian Broadcasting System, provided one of many delicious little period details during the film's first half. There are also cameos squeezed in by Django Reinhardt, Josephine Baker, and Fred Astaire (who is eaten up by one of his tap shoes). Likewise the visions of period Tour de France training crews and roadside fans are priceless.  It's difficult to do justice to such an intricate effort.  The devil and the wonder are both in the details.  Despite the lack of dialogue as a central element and its replacement by incidental noise (as well as occasional jaunty jazz), a feature that links The Triplets with the comic films of Jacques Tati, there really is a lot of quick French at times, and I have the feeling that in omitting subtitles, the filmmakers or distributors have robbed Anglophone viewers of some of the richest details; that there's French stuff here we can never hope to grasp. For the devotee, this is definitely one for repeated viewings.  There's a lot to take in -- if you've got the stomach for it.  Once may be enough for many, but anybody interested in animation needs that once.  Not suitable for young children or anyone easily weirded out."
14,The Triplets of Belleville,,26 June 2004,definitely Different,"This animated feature by Sylvain Chomet was seriously weird. The visuals were like no other movie I've seen and even now, weeks after I've seen it they still haunt my imagination. In structure the story is quite conventional  Madame Souza trains up her geeky grandson to be a top-line cyclist (a very French ambition) but while he is competing in the Tour de France he is abducted by criminals who remove him to `Belleville' on the other side of the Atlantic. M. Souza goes to find him and after many adventureswell, you know the rest. There's plenty of chasing about on Belleville's streets and freeways in very French looking vehicles that look like stretch limo versions of the immortal Citroen 2CV. Belleville itself is a curious amalgam of New York, Montreal and Paris, and seems to owe something to Fritz Lang's `Metropolis'.The eponymous triplets are three former 30s singing stars now reduced to playing in cheap cafes, busking and eating frog's legs, of which Belleville seems to have an ample supply. They take M de Souza in and help her in her quest without any great benefit to themselves.  I did think it might help to appreciate this movie if you were French. There is virtually no dialogue (though plenty of singing) but there seem to be numerous references presumably satirical to various French national obsessions and preoccupations. What is the joke is not always clear to an outsider. Is there any significance in M Souza's originally being Portuguese? (She actually bears a close resemblance to the English cartoonist Giles's Grandma). Are top cyclist just nervy greyhounds with huge leg muscles? Do the French see themselves as svelte and Americans as all grossly obese? Are the French self-conscious about being typecast as frog-eaters? Are Citroen really planning a stretch limo version of the 2CV? I don't know, but then I don't need to. Definitely different."
15,The Triplets of Belleville,10,24 April 2007,"""What have you got to say to Grandma?""","""The Triplets of Bellville"" (2003) - is an extraordinary, original, inventive animated film with the simple and touching story and the unusual characters. There are a loving, brave, and creative grandmother, Madame Souza, and her orphaned grandson, Champion, one of the best French cyclists, their old faithful dog Bruno, evil gangsters-kidnappers with the huge square shoulders, the titular triplets of Bellville, the eccentric singers-sisters, once jazz-era divas and now three batty old women still in jazz business with the most unusual musical instruments and favorite foods. When Champion is kidnapped by gangsters and taken across the Ocean to the City of Bellville, Madame Souza and Bruno, without hesitation follow his trail. In Bellville, they meet the triplets and together they will find out the mystery behind Champion's disappearance that would take them to an underground betting parlor that is run by the dangerous mafia. ""The Triplets of Bellville"" is certainly the film like no others. Its images and details are highly original, often charming, sometimes, grotesque and even ugly, and funny without being pretty and they (images) tell the story because the film has no dialog. The original song, ""Belleville Rendez-Vous"" was literally the breath of fresh air that waked me up during the rather predictable and monotonic Oscar's ceremony of that year. The film is a clever satire that makes fun of the stereotypes, French and American, but it never forgets the story it tells and its main idea which is true, powerful and unconditional love that would help to cross the Ocean, to fight the dangerous gangsters and to bring back home the beloved little boy who is not little anymore but who needed the help and love from his incredible grandmother and her oddball friends. Sylvain Chomet dedicated the film to his parents. I don't know his biography but I am sure that wherever they are, his parents should be very proud of him and happy to receive such a wonderful gift from their boy."
16,The Triplets of Belleville,10,14 May 2005,Shockingly brilliant,"I assumed this animated movie will be boring, but wanted to watch it anyway. Movie ended 80 minutes later, and I almost cried for more. My girlfriend kept on asking me ""Why do you love it so much?"", and yet I couldn't explain it to either her or myself.Movie is very original. There are almost no dialogs, and you would never think that such 'silly' animation (which I love, since I am used to various French comics and types of drawings they use) would be able to give so much clarity to characters.If nothing else, you must watch the movie just to see the dog (I'd give him an Oscar :)"
17,The Triplets of Belleville,7,29 January 2006,Strange movie but original for sure,"'Les Triplettes de Belleville' is a different movie, with a grotesque animation and also a very strange plot. I cannot say that I loved it because I found the draws and the story bizarre and a little bit of disturbing,but I cannot say that is a bad movie, because it is very original. This film portrays everything with lots of symbolism and you need to pay attention to understand or to know some facts. It also makes references to famous people, like the American Josephine Baker,( who made a lot of success in France) Fred Astaire and Charles Chaplin (in a poster). By the way, the song that Madame Souza sings is a famous music from Portugal(''Fado'') called ''Uma Casa Portuguesa''( 'A Portuguese house'). You need to watch this movie more than 1 time to catch some things: The first time I watched, I thought that the characters didn't have a name,and only in the second time I got the cyclist name was 'champion', the dog was 'Bruno'and the grandmother was 'souza'.Funny facts: The Americans being portrayed as obese. Everybody in USA is fat, they show lots of fast foods and pollution and even the statue of Liberty, a french present to the Americans, is fat in the movie, holding an ice cream instead of the torch. Some people are saying that is 'anti American', but I see as a funny joke , that tells that they should take care of their health and Bush should sign the Kyoto's protocol."
18,The Triplets of Belleville,10,12 November 2006,in one word: artistic masterpiece! (ok that's two words),"If you love animation like I do you will adore this one! A crime story that will keep you in suspense for whole 78minutes! The scenery is marvelous every thing is so beautifully exaggerated, the bodyguards wide as cupboards, transatlantic ships higher than buildings, the people and their features. Every frame of this movie is a artistic gem and we are taking about very French art but don't worry the comedy in it is very universal and I know you'll find yourself as amused as I was (and will be many times again!). It's the most original animated movie ever created not just the graphics but also the music and the whole concept for that I give it ten stars!"
19,The Triplets of Belleville,,17 February 2004,An unfortunate movie...,"I must say that I'm not entirely certain what the appeal of this film is. Perhaps there is a cutting-edge, avant garde aspect to this movie that was lost on me.  I read reviews of this movie calling it an ingenious lampoon of the American and French cultures. This might be a spoiler, but I don't particularly see anything innovative or entertaining; the French love biking and wine and the Americans are fat.  I really don't view this as much of anything but a failed attempt at satirical commentary.  Beyond this, the commentary in the movie manages to be preachy regardless of the fact that The Triplets of Belleville is almost without dialogue.This movie honestly thoroughly disappointed me.  The animation is commendable, but the hype surrounding this movie really led me to believe I would be seeing something else.  It made for an uncomfortable evening and a less than pleasant experience at the theatre.  I really can't suggest strongly enough that, if one is looking for a stimulating and entertaining experience...don't see this movie."
20,The Triplets of Belleville,9,13 February 2007,Don't Bother Finding Nemo. Rendez Vous With Belleville.,"The review which couples the IMDb webpage for Belleville has a commentator claiming that this is a Pixar world. Well a pox on Pixar and a pox on you. In a world where Pixar is merely setting the benchmark for recycled story lines involving ever changing animals and settings which is then in turn lapped up by prepubescents and alas most generic movie goers, animation around the world is reminding us not only in what medium it all began, but more importantly, how to make damned good cinema that talking fish could never achieve.Belleville is a glorious piece of cinematic work that encompasses the grander elements of the human condition in hardwork, loyalty and love. Wonderfully defined, the animation in Belleville is of the highest degree, with perfect angular landscapes and characatural inhabitants. It is simplistic yet delicate and complex. It grows with each viewing, and deserves ample praise. This film is not merely about pencil and paper. Belleville deserves to be recognised up there with Spirited Away, and one can only hope that writers of Madagascar, and the ilk, lie awake at night and are ashamed.The first three minutes of the film set the tone, for never has a theme stuck in my head quite like the rendition of the films title song. The irony being that these are the only moments in which words are said. This is not a silent film, as dogs bark and trains charge down rail tracks, but it proves when something is this good the story will speak for itself, and no translation is needed to understanding emotional warmth, and the bond between family.It is not, however to be taken lightly, as it harbours some severely macabre moments, with its plot moving in unpredictable (unless you read the back of the box) ways. It is by no means violent, but it is dark in parts if through moments of sadness than anything else, and thus will work through a wider range of levels than ""in-jokes"" in a Pixar flick. A Pixar flick may provide the odd ""older"" reference, but adults will never derive the sense of satisfaction and betterment than they will through this film, as nothing is ever forced, not least through mundane dialogue.Suffice to say Belleville Rendezvous is animation personified. It highlights the ability to express ideas, and create films in a way which is simply not possible with actors and a camera. And for all the razzmatazz of ever increasingly developed computer generated imagery, it will never gift you the same pleasures as being able to sense the hard work and devotion placed into a film such as this. While Disney have turned their backs on the very foundations on which they layed, the rest of the world have furthered those ideas, and simply made them infinitely better, and this is but one example."
21,The Triplets of Belleville,8,15 November 2012,An excellent and very creative animated film,"There are few good animated film made outside of Japan. Most of the good animated films made outside Japan are the excellent but simple films of Pixar and classic Disney. Here we appear to have a pleasant alternative: a highly creative and poignant animated french film.Some consider it as a pinnacle in terms of animation features even comparable to Spirited Away. I would strongly disagree here, this film is excellent but Spirited Away is a timeless masterpiece. It's like comparing the excellent Source Code to a classic such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. It is unfair and should not be done.Highly recommended still. Just do not expect a masterpiece."
22,The Triplets of Belleville,9,19 June 2012,Impenetrable whimsy,"Many animated films bring forth a recognizable presence on screen, but The Triplets of Belleville brings the damnedest of them all. It's a unique little animated feature, with a lot of style, a lot of heart, and a lot of enigma and illusion presented in its meager runtime. It is a delightful break from the polished mainstream animation, yet I don't believe it's the break a lot of people will be so willing to take.First off, the color pallet takes time to adapt to. It seems someone created storyboards for the film and poured oil all over them. Everything is in a dim green, brown, yellow, or muted tint (very different from the brazen style of candy colors we're so used to seeing today). But it is so limitless and appealing and works on such a wonderful level for the film's imagination. It makes itself out to be modest, yet delivers so much promise and life into its very simplistic screenplay, or lack thereof.The film is mostly silent, punctuated by lively scenes of vaudevillian style musical numbers. We follow Madame Souza, a grandmother to a boy named Champion. He is depressed and very lonely after the implied death of his parents. Souza buys him an irresistible dog named Bruno, but his interest is only held for a short time. When Champion develops a fondness for competitive cycling, Souza buys him a tricycle. We fast-forward several years later where the same boy, now a man, is being coached by Souza for the Tour De France.When he races in the Tour De France, he is kidnapped by the strangest of goons and taken to an unknown location. Souza and Bruno become desperate to find him, and stumble into the care of three elderly women known as the ""Belleville Triplets."" They are taken in, fed and sheltered, yet are still determined to find Champion and the French henchmen that took him.Besides the unique animation, one of the first things you will notice is the intense and quirky character design. Many characters in the film are disproportionated in size, or are presented as bigger, bulkier, smaller, thinner, wider, or boxier (the henchman have thick, box-like shoulders), with heavy emphasis on muscles and especially facial structure. The result is totally mesmerizing and extremely beyond convention. It gives the film such a surrealistic feeling, but that's not the only thing that contributes to that idea.I define surrealism as realism with a strong twist on obscurity or a strong twist on reality, where logic is strictly applied or noticeably bent. The Triplets of Belleville mixes some live action sequences with stylish old video, particularly, the bike stimulation sequence and the water when traveling at sea. For all I know, those were authentic sea currents.Another thing the film does impeccably well is it conveys emotion using very little dialog. Most of the time, we hear a soft, melodic tune play comfortingly in the background, and once in a while, the triplets will break out into a great, perfectly executed musical number. The emotion is not presented through the window of heavy sentiment, but with crystal clear expression, music tonality, and character appearances all naturally and not in a heavy-handed manner.The Triplets of Belleville is such an admirably different film, but saying that doesn't even do it justice. It establishes this world, which is brilliantly surreal and conceived effervescently, erects it on captivating whimsy and Sylvain Chomet's stunning animation, and relies on subtle, controlled nuances to carry itself through its runtime. Keep in mind, this is a world where animated films are boastful and boisterous in their color, design, and structure, and along comes a film so serene and joyous that we are surprised at it and ourselves for liking it. What an impressionistic gem of a picture.Directed by: Sylvain Chomet."
23,The Triplets of Belleville,6,5 February 2011,Wow... that's about all I can say...,"This film was definitely different -- different than what I expected, and different from other animated films I've seen. I'm a fan of foreign films, and a fan of animation such as Miyazaki. The animation style in this film was fascinating and compelling; watching this quasi-silent movie for 80 minutes seemed a bit of a stretch. Honestly, this would have been wonderful as a 14-minute short.While there were some delightful moments and sparks of brilliance, I found the characters overall to be, well, two-dimensional. Mme. Souza and Champion were emotionally opaque, and un-engaging. Perhaps the best character was actually Bruno: capturing the mannerisms of a dog so faithfully.In summary: interesting, worth a watch, but I definitely wouldn't rent this one again."
24,The Triplets of Belleville,,28 March 2007,Let it wash over you,"""The Triplets of Belleville"" (French, 2004): Prepare yourself for a unique experience. This is pure animation in the very best sense of the word. Take the high point of Disneybetter yet, the Fleischer Brothers  in the 30's and 40's  remove all the Disney schmaltz, make the visuals even better (!), create an entire story with no dialog, cool music, extremely sensitive ambient sound, incredible insights into the details of daily creatures (human and otherwise), rooms, machines, etc., sprinkle in some really weird, gross, and dark humor moments then just sit back and let it wash over you. It's VERY refreshing. I wish I could say I'd been in on this Vision."
25,The Triplets of Belleville,9,30 September 2006,Wonderfully eccentric!,"Got this film free with 'The Times' the other week. It's brilliant. Gloriously observed, quirky, fantastic animation and music. Mind you, I'd not have thought it would appeal to children particularly, as suggested on the cover blurb. But as a cartoon for grown-ups, it's quite something. Gosh, this is my first comment, didn't realise I had to write 10 lines - there was me trying to be pithy! (Wonder if returns count.)Well, if you'd like some more - guest appearances by Josephine Baker and Fred Astaire. Just like the minimalism of the story, little explanation, you just have to work it out for yourself. So rare to find a film that seems to actively seeks your contribution.If you liked Delicatessen, you'll like this."
26,The Triplets of Belleville,8,9 September 2006,A Fine French Export,"Have a look at the negative comments about this animated film. A lot of them make the point that ""Belleville Rendezvous"" shows all Americans as grossly overweight. I think that these negative reviews may be written by Americans. Did they not notice the French cyclists who behave like dumb racehorses, the demented French accordion player, the callous French mafiosi or the fact that pretty much everyone in the film had something ODD about them?Let's face it, this film is intentionally and distinctly ODD. It's not to everyone's taste (my wife hates it) but to call it bad because it portrays Americans as fat is a little severe.Sylvain Chomet's film blends traditional animation and computer graphics very well and utilises the best from both mediums to good effect. The production design is highly detailed and this is enhanced by giving things like bicycles (notoriously difficult to draw by hand) a CGI makeover. My personal favourite moments are the pitiful accordion wheezing from the van stuck under a low bridge in Marseilles, an object lesson on how to catch frogs with a hand grenade and the sublimely ridiculous chase scene with the mafia in elongated Citroen 2CVs.Recommended to fans of the surreal."
27,The Triplets of Belleville,8,23 December 2005,A movie with fantastic animations and a plot which is one of a kind!,"This movie has the most astonishing animations, it looks like the whole film has been drawn without the help of computers (exsept for the water). the drawing technique gives the film a surrealistic kind of vibe and sets a mood there is above every animated film i've ever seen.The characters are also very well done depending their personalities, especially the old woman which is my personal favorite.I will recommend this animated wonder to ALL animated-film fans, but also just every movie""addict"", definitely a worthy film to your collection!!!-Hannibal"
28,The Triplets of Belleville,,8 May 2004,"Not hand-drawn, and not quite the anti-Disney","While a lot of the comments here seem to see this as the antithesis of American Disney- or Pixar-style animation, its blood lines are not as far removed from those examples as you might think.  Chomet explains in short documentary features on the DVD that the film was meant to look hand drawn, and though the character designs originated as loosely-rendered blue pencil sketches on Chomet's drawing pad, much if not all of what you see in the film itself is indeed computer animation.  The look of the film, according to Chomet, is actually heavily influenced by Disney's ""new"" animation style of the 1960s that was unveiled in the film ""101 Dalmatians.""At the same time, it can't be denied that this film is distinctly European in style, and likely to bore people who expect an animated film to be bright, colorful, loud, and not particularly subtle or complex.  Its wealth of detail is staggering, and can't be taken in through one cursory viewing. The little quirks of characterization and character design are numerous, but all the easier to discern because it's cinema in the classical sense of being primarily a visual medium, and there's not a lot of yammering for the sake of plot exposition or as a shortcut to characterization.  Those are meant to be gained through observation, and what a feast for the eyes it is. This is another example of a film at which simple people with simple tastes lob the tired old warhorse criticism ""pretentious.""  There's nothing wrong or shameful in having simple tastes, bit I wish they wouldn't feel thus obligated to publicly pee all over any work of art more subtle than a Roger Rabbit cartoon.I think special mention should be made of the soundtrack, which is a rich brew of sound layered on sound, but with a decidedly delicate touch.  Note the sound effects in the climactic car chase through the streets of Belleville.  Most filmmakers would be temped to goose up the excitement and chaos of the scene with loud, piercing sounds of crashing, screeching tires, gunshots, etc.  While these noises are present, they are in fact applied very lightly and delicately, sounding almost like the collision of toy cars and the shooting of toy guns, which lends the scene a surreal, otherworldly quality that the more conventional choice of loud, overbearing sound effects wouldn't yield.  It's been remarked here that the combination of minimalist dialog, strange characters, and baroquely complex settings are reminiscent of Jeunet, and I think that's the most apt comparison, particularly his earlier style as in ""Delicatessen.""The first scene is of particular interest in that it is in a different style from the rest of the film, designed to look like old black and white animation from the 1930s.  One of the conventions of animated shorts in that era was to include bizarre caricatures of celebrities.  Now I recognized Django Reinhardt, Josephine Baker, and Fred Astair, but who was the orchestra conductor supposed to be?  He has very distinctive features which lead me to believe he represents some specific real person, but nobody comes to mind.  Maybe he's someone better known to a French audience?  I'd be very interested to know.Some people seem to think there is a strong anti-American bias to this film. Does it poke fun at North-Americans?  Sure it does, but it also makes fun of the French (note the huge noses, receding chins, and tiny little mustaches, along with the Triplets' penchant for regarding whatever slimy thing they can yank out of the swamp as a succulent delicacy).  Admittedly this French caricaturing is not quite as barbed as the swipes at American culture.  But come on, we're big boys.  We can take it!  Just gnaw on a few freedom fries and suck it up already.  Actually, this film sort of sums up the history of France's attitudes toward American culture over the last 70 years.  They adored us in the 1930s, but the honeymoon has been over for a while.One more detail.  To an earlier commentator who found it hilarious that in the song ""Belleville Rendezvous"" the Triplets sing the phrase ""ca-ca,"" they are in fact singing ""can can"" (""voodoo, can-can"").  The characteristic French pronunciation ""cahn-cahn"" just makes it sound a lot like ""ca-ca."""
29,The Triplets of Belleville,,14 February 2004,Not my cup of tea,"I guess there's an audience for this type of stuff, but I just couldn't find myself getting into it.  The first 20 minutes were OK focusing on the dog, but after that, pretty dull.  Apparently I wasn't alone, because I can't recall seeing as many people asleep at a movie as I did this one.  Normally when someone is snoring behind me I become annoyed, but for Triplets I can understand.  I enjoyed Spirited Away from a couple of years ago (although I felt it was a bit overrated), but this had me checking my watch constantly. How are you supposed to care about these characters?  The mother (or grandmother? who knows?) and young man don't change facial expressions the entire film.  The few moments of droll humor were met mostly with complete silence from the viewing audience I was with, save for one ""enlightened"" viewer who chose to scream out with laughter on every pause given.  And one other thing:  don't bring kids to this.  Save for some nudity in the opening musical sequence, there's nothing of that nature to worry about; but if you're expecting Finding Nemo, you're going to end up with a very bored child about 35 minutes into this."
30,The Triplets of Belleville,10,13 February 2007,A great animated movie from France .,"This movie is just wonderful .Many people see the animation as something that only kids would like ,but there are masterpieces in the genre that confirm that animation could be art . There was along time ago that I haven't seen an animated french movie (I liked one called ""Fanstastic Planet ""when I was a kid )But I loved this movie from the beginning to end ,with a very original opening sequence that makes homage to the old cartoons . The designs are stylish and original ,the music is just gorgeous . Even when the characters almost don't talk ,words aren't necessary to understand what they are thinking or what they want . The story is funny ,enjoyable and the characters are very likable ,even if they don't talk . Directed by Sylvain Chomet ,who also directed the short ""The Old Lady and the Pigeons "" that was nominated to an Academy Award.I can't wait to see a new movie from him ."
31,The Triplets of Belleville,8,27 September 2004,Totally fascinating and bizarre.,"What a fantastically weird movie. It's got far more going for it than that, of course, but you have to get that fact out of the way first: Les Triplettes de Belleville is weird as hell. Featuring wonderfully unique animation and very catchy music, this film features an absolute minimum of dialogue but manages to use that to its advantage. Certainly it's got a good deal of anti-American stuff, but if you're the type to watch a movie like this in the first place, you're probably not so offended by the realization that not everybody likes us. Also, the fat people (including the Statue of Liberty) are sort of hilarious-looking.That said, I didn't think I'd really enjoy this film, but I did, so much that months after seeing it I remember it vividly. Definitely recommended for those interested in animation and art; recommended also to anybody who says, ""Geez, that sounds like the sort of film I should appreciate, but I just don't know if I'm up to it."" A nice work I'd like to see again."
32,The Triplets of Belleville,,3 February 2006,Dream Stories,"Let's see. How many stories are within this story.There's the show at the beginning which our heroine watches that gets transformed into her dream about the capture of the grandson she'll never have. When that show comes alive as reality, it gets mirrored back as the triplets do a show within (using items from their ""real"" house.)There's the show of the bike race which gets captured and turned into a show on a stage for bettors, while head gangster dreams. As with the triplets, it contains a show within, the projection of reality for the (presumably stoned) cyclists. And that projection becomes real again when the contraption is turned into a getaway vehicle.There's even the show the dog sees and barks at when the train goes by. Even that gets turned around as the dog similarly dreams himself on the train being barked at. And his train at home gets mirrored at the triplets' house.Smaller things: scenes meld into each other as elements literally morph. The women in disguise. The TeeVee show she watches when at the triplets'.Many reviewers have called this surreal. I suppose that's true in the broad sense that it is unreal. But surrealism is a specific bend or reality where things don't make sense. This reality is bent in exactly the opposite way: things make a whole lot more sense that they do in the world in which I live.Characteristics are more clear and clearly seen, Behavior is more direct and noble, not at all chaotic. And of course, it wouldn't be such a deep cut on the nature of the French, if it were not so true.I appreciated the attention given to the structure of the thing. Immense structure: dreams within dreams randomly. And I'll always join in on making fun of the French. Also, we need to celebrate any animation that has personality.But I wish the story itself had as much bite as the structure and tone of the thing. As it stands now, it still falls into the Disney pattern of goodness triumphing over evil.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
33,The Triplets of Belleville,1,22 May 2004,A pile of crap wrapped with a pretty bow,"First off, let me just say that I am extremely open minded when it comes to film, and I can find enjoyment in just about anything. I typically despise Hollywood derivative nonsense. Also, I can appreciate French movies, such as Amelie, Delicatessen, and City of Lost Children.This movie starts out promisingly enough. You know you're in for something unique and different, and the animation style is very nice to look at.But after the first 10 minutes or so, the movie has already run the course. The once beautiful animation just gets annoying, as you realize that the ""story"" is meaningless. Scenes that were once cute an inventive just repeat themselves over and over and make you hate them. The arrogant French smugness of it all becomes overbearing, and the useless characters turn into a huge bore.My anger toward this movie was only exacerbated by imagining the praise it received. For anyone who says that Hollywood or Disney should learn from this movie, I respectfully disagree. I can't imagine a stream of movies as pointless and un-funny as this one. Don't believe the hype, folks. If you are easily entertained by shiny objects, then maybe this is for you. Otherwise, if you like movies with interesting characters and story lines, then stand clear of this overrated French stinker."
34,The Triplets of Belleville,1,27 January 2005,EXTREMELY Over rated!!!,"Wow, People To all the folks on this board who think Disney is the only animation out there and this lame bit of fluff is some sort of cure....You really need to watch some of the very innovative animation on US TV like South Park and some of the better Cartoon Network offerings. Go rent some Japanese animation such as ""Spirited Away"" (THAT was TRULY a magic experience).I'm sure if we hunted around in other places on the globe we could find other entertaining animation, but believe me, this ain't one of them.I had heard so much good stuff about this film, I was expecting to at LEAST see some good animation. OK, nice style, but as for the plot, characters, and yes, the very out of place and ugly stereotypes, I was either insulted or bored.So, we have at the start Three French women who sing, and then a kid who wants to ride bikes. That's sweet, and for the first 15 minutes the film was watchable.Then they launch into this stupid plot about Americans who have to go, yes, ALL THE WAY TO France (because even though Lance Armstrong wins the Tour year after year we're all too greedy and fat to have our own bike riders...? Huh? What?) and kidnap some poor, unsuspecting French bicyclists to be used as ""race horses"" in some sort of betting scheme. They drag the bicyclists over to what seems to be New York City (Belleville). This is a place with nothing but mean, fat people in it except for the triplets who are (of course) from France.The unintentionally funny part to me about the American slams was the fact that they were so... lame.I mean, c'mon, some stale stereotypes about fat, greedy Americans? If you're a clever satirist, you can make another person or country laugh at themselves and get some sort of communication going even while you make fun... but this? This was like something a five year old would write.Put the shoe on the other foot and try to find something actually entertaining to say next time, OK people? Stop and think about it, I really doubt if Disney made a film featuring France as a place populated only by bigoted snobs and women who don't shave their armpit hair that the French would find it a laugh riot to show the kids.So, the young man is kidnapped, the grandma goes across the Atlantic to save him (pulled by their trusty dog) and the Triplets of Belleville help grandma save the grandson from the oh-so-evil Americans. Uh, the end.Aside from quirky little side elements such as the dog pulling the boat and the house in France leaning way back to accommodate a train track, there is nothing much else to this movie. The story is boring and the characters are either repulsive or dull.In other words, it's a lot of trying-so-hard-to-be-charming little moments surrounded by hot air and not much else. Really, don't waste your time like I did."
35,The Triplets of Belleville,2,9 May 2005,Even the chase scene was slow!!,"Slow and boring; this film oddly sucked all the energy out of me. After the end, I felt like sitting in a tub for half an hour.I guess the filmmakers had a genius idea: ""I know! Let's forget dialogue and instead of having characters express themselves verbally in 2 seconds, let's convey the same information through silent animations that take 8 times longer! Bada-bing, now we have a feature-length film out of a 15-minute plot!"" ""-gasp-! But won't that make the film horribly long and boring?"" ""Nah, we'll give them beautiful animation to look at in the meantime and we'll rely on our lovable quirky Frenchness to fill out the rest!"" The result is a film which painfully grinds on much like whatever-the-hell-the-bicyclists-were-pedaling at the end of the movie.I don't know if it's my short American attention span or what, but movies have dialogue for a reason: to avoid long-ass drawn-out artsy student film style ""character studies"" where you see a person sigh and blink for half an hour. If you like movies where stuff happens, then don't bother with this one."
36,The Triplets of Belleville,4,7 May 2008,"Graphic quality, strange, grotesque","Even though I'm from Europe, I find it hard to understand the 'artsy pretend' in the local cinematic works. Some times an original angle can be indeed refreshing. Thanks goodness we have no receipt to making movies like the Hollywood one. But still, this here is not the case. It's artsy, it is strange and convoluted, but in the end there is no message to this movie.I left it with nothing, no uplifting feeling, no new take on life's events, nothing. Just a feeling of emptiness. If that's the intended message, than great movie. In fact, I think I just saw a French animated take on Bloodsport. VanDamme, betting frenzy, the whole package, the culmination of which was an even better riding in the sunset Commando stile. Sure, it looks great. There is some great comic strip quality to the drawings that builds on the characters. But there should be more to a movie that just the pretend of avantgarde. Ask one of those critics that nominated it for an Oscar. They will start raving about the incredible portray of human condition and inevitable sadness of our pointless life pursuits. I found funny that a great number of above 8 ratings can be summarized by: ""Gee, this movie is amazing. I can see it seems to be saying something, but I have no idea. I'll give it a 9 stars because it seems so wise 'n stuff"". Well, here is a guy that comes out saying ""the emperor has no clothes"". And all the court is still singing praises. Get real guys!"
37,The Triplets of Belleville,5,9 August 2004,Swept up by the Peloton,"I though the film started well, and as a fan of ""Le Tour"" was happy to see anything which brings it closer to the public's attention. The opening scenes, of the triplets in the past, the rider's childhood, the changing scenery around his and his grandmother's house representing the passage of time, were excellent. The practice and the Tour itself along with the kidnapping were well done. However, at this point the laughs began to get a little repetative - the dog with the train, Granny and the whistle. It was livened up by the appearance of the triplets, and their interesting eating arrangements! However, it just sort of tailed off after that and failed to hold my interest despite its quirkiness & the ending was, well, pretty lame.While the animation was great throughout, the whole film had bags of atmosphere and the lack of dialog made it quirky & fun, I somehow felt gipped out of my money for the rental fee. I really like animated features. Whereas I'd give the Wallace and Gromit films high praise, this falls flat by comparison and gets a ""mediocre"" on my personal scale.I have to wonder about all the awards & praise. Perhaps the reviewers & voters were more interested in finding something with anti-American overtones (although I think its more anti-modernity in nature). Perhaps animations were thin on the ground this year. Perhaps, as with many reviewers, they tend to give rave reviews to things that are different. Being different for its own sake, to them, is tantamount to being good, simply because they watch so much that is the same. However refreshing something can be for being different, or quirky, though, it does not actually, when all is said and done, really make it ""good"". I like to call this the ""Royal Tenenbaums Syndrome""."
38,The Triplets of Belleville,2,28 May 2007,The Only Film I've Ever Walked Out Of,"Maybe this movie has deep symbolic meaning, but if you're going to deliver deep symbolic meaning, try doing it in a way that doesn't gradually empty the theatre before the movie's even half over. My friend chose this movie for us to go and see because generally, we're interested in foreign films and she's very much into the visual arts. When we went into the theatre, there were maybe fifteen people there. By the time we agreed to leave, well before the ending of the movie, we were the last people in the theatre. This movie was not funny, not clever, and had the most meandering plot line (if indeed one existed at all) I've ever come across. Even my friend, who commented that she liked the style of the art, was bored to tears and couldn't understand what was going on. I'm pretty sure that this flick is, hands down, the worst movie I've ever seen."
39,The Triplets of Belleville,5,28 January 2013,Typical French Emotionless Movie,"The more I think of this movie, the more I hate it.Why is that? Because as time passes, I forget its shiny looks and nicely done drawings, and see it more as it really is: an empty shell of a movie, with no lovable character, and a very lame, unoriginal and clichéd story. And especially boring. I believe that it is 1000 times more difficult to make somebody laugh and marvel at something beautiful, than to create ugly works (much easier actually). That is why modern art is most of times about ugly stuff. Yes, I am comparing this movie to modern art, because that is what I was thinking of during the entire movie. Ugliness disguised as satire. This movie is also devoid of any emotional feelings. This is what you get when you try to make something original just for the sake of it, while not being inspired at all. The french have a long lasting hatred against the Americans, mainly because their greatness has been utterly reduced to practically nothing. So, in a desperate effort to prove that they still exist and still capable of reaching the high level of American Movies like Rattatouile Toy Story, etc., they said to themselves why not make a satire on these movies. Except that I, for one, saw right through it as it really is: a lame movie. Period. Next time, try to make us laugh, or cry, or happy or sad, anything but try to make us feel something. And then we'll talk about your views on fat Americans and Disney movies.4/10 only for the graphics."
40,The Triplets of Belleville,10,6 June 2005,What an unexpected gem!,"This is a WILD movie! A friend was visiting and we rented the video on her suggestion. I sat there awe-struck the whole time. I don't even know how to begin to describe this movie. There is a lot of symbolism in this movie such as fat people. They're everywhere. It's really funny and very clever. Of course it's a French movie (France-Canada-Belgium). It takes place in a setting that seems to be an amalgam of Paris/New York City.The dog and the grandmother are great. The grandmother lovingly and patiently dotes on her young grandson and tries to find out what makes him happy. When she discovers that he loves bicycles, she buys him a tricycle and proceeds to support and encourage him in his lifelong goal to train for a big race. His life becomes all-consuming with all things ""bicycle."" When he grows up he competes in what one has to assume is the Tour de France. During the race he is taken captive by a secret CIA/Mafia/Corporate executive type to participate in an underground pseudo-racing game where other secret CIA/Mafia/Corporate executive types place bets. The grandmother and the dog get the help of ""Les Triplettes de Bellville"" to help free her grandson. This description doesn't begin to do justice to the movie.The animation is fascinating and very perceptive.This is a movie I would buy for my own private collection. This is a GREAT movie! It will be a cult classic for sure."
41,The Triplets of Belleville,10,13 January 2005,A classic,"This is an animated film that does what animated films are supposed to do. Take us just to the edge of reality and still remain applicable to ourselves. Warning: This is not your average kiddie movie.When I first watched this movie, I have to admit, I was lost. Of course, I had started about 15 minutes into the movie and felt like I was missing something the whole time. You really need to watch this movie from beginning to end to understand the whole plot, but the amazing thing about it is, you don't have to understand the plot to enjoy the movie. Like I said, I was lost, but I fell in love with it. The style, details, and witty satire were bursting at the seams, and the director managed to do it almost completely without dialogue. The movie was filled with caricatures of people you see all the time, but don't necessarily think about all the time, from the obese and slightly dim boy scout to the maitre'd, bent over backwards (literally) to impress.I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and it quickly became one of my favorites. It was such a refreshing change in a time where Finding Nemo and The Incredibles (however entertaining, seem to be lacking in originality and a true reflection of humanity) are hailed as masterpieces. Though this movie is definitely not a kid's movie, it reminds you of why you loved animated movies as a kid."
42,The Triplets of Belleville,10,4 January 2005,Masterpiece of insight and humor,"Yes, it's weird. And boy, is it wonderful! Some of the images that will remain in my head forever: the triplets licking their frogcicles, the quintessentially obsequious restaurant maitre d', the hysterically rectangular bad guys, the grotesquely gluttonous city pedestrians, the spectacular looming freighter and precisely detailed harbor scenes, the street chase scene with its image-driven motif (with the tiny spot of glowing film in the midst of animation). It's a story dedicated to following dreams, honoring traditions, and overcoming mindless stupidity and greed. It's a movie that's smart, wise, and darkly filled with hope. And it's a riot, too! A keeper!"
43,The Triplets of Belleville,7,23 September 2014,Good Old-Timey Fun,"Triplets manages to be a solid film despite the lack of dialog. Some movies that try this style are a bore, but Triplets is enjoyable because of its solid pace and great animation. Its best aspect is its style - characters and objects are portrayed in cartoonish, amusing ways. A biker has a huge nose, tall, emaciated body, and bulging legs like biceps. A tiny, wealthy man is protected perfectly between square, identical body guards. They're pretty creative images, and they're shown throughout the film. It also has some pretty good jokes, without needing words to set them up. A small nitpick is the caricatures seen in America. All of the background characters are obese. I'm not offended by it, but considering the ingenious designs in the rest of the movie, Triplets was picking at low-hanging fruit. But that's a minor grievance. Overall, its an appealing, fun ride, with enough style to make it unique."
44,The Triplets of Belleville,10,30 April 2012,If you're looking for wildly original animation then this movie is for you,"In recent years there has been a boom (probably thanks to globalization) in the release of foreign animated films outside the common market (read Disney,Dreamworks, Japanese anime), mainly European emerging as alternatives for those seeking animation not made for little children. Within this wave comes the french movie The Triplets of Belleville, one of the most original animated films ever made (in the opinion of this writer, of course).Directed by Sylvain Chomet tells the story of Madame Souza who is in charge of raising her grandson Champion after being orphaned. In search of something that makes him happy, she discovers that Champion's true vocation is cycling and after years of hard training is ready to compete in the famous Tour de France. But in the middle of the competition he is kidnapped by a mafia that uses cyclists for clandestine betting and they're killed if they lose. Thus, Madame Souza begins the rescue of her grandson in the bizarre town of Belleville with the help of the triplets of Belleville, famous stars of music hall in the 20's.This is how Chomet creates an amazing story full of absurdities and nonsensical situations that works wonderfully and without the need of dialog creates absolute empathy to characters that appear to be designed to cause annoyance. A very curious element is Chomet's decision to portray Belleville (an obvious reference to the city of New York) as a city full of obese people. Although this is meant as a critique of Western society where consumption makes people apathetic and uninterested in themselves.Moreover, the music plays an important role in this film, without being a musical in the strict sense of the word has incredibly vivid and infectious musical moments, like the opening scene which recalls the glory years of the triplets and in the making small appearances of legends like Django Reinhardt, Josephine Baker and Fred Astaire, in addition the soundtrack composed by Benoit Charest adds a feeling of nostalgia.In short, The Triplets of Belleville is the perfect example of an animated film that breaks all established and refreshes the genre in an unexpected way."
45,The Triplets of Belleville,9,28 June 2011,"stereotypes? yes, please!","I guess this movie is just culturally boxing. I read many reviews from haters, and I understand what made them hate it. I, however, loved it.I am Portuguese myself, and have travelled about, and the depictions in the movie are what a foreigner will first unavoidably perceive of a new people. They are not meant to be offensive, but rather to be amusing, exactly because they are so raw and placeable. There are stereotypes of even the creating crew: if they can be self-critic, we can take the joke too. And none of the characters gets ostracized based on their origins, and they find it to team up despite their differences.There is little to no dialogue, and yet you do get the language of it all, if you pay attention. There are subliminal, intentional messages in every sound you hear. You could be an illiterate 100-word goat-shepherd anywhere in the world and still grasp at what is told, simply because you can see and you can hear.So, this movie is a humouristic play with human xenophobia, which separates nations, AND with wordless communication, which unites nations. Surely you will appreciate the irony!Furthermore, the love this granny feels for her detached grandson is admirable and endearing. He rarely acknowledges her, and yet she is completely dedicated to him. What greater devotion is there? (And no, I am not a cheesy chick at all, trust me.) But I admit I may be too biased here: Souza is so much like my grandmother, and the boy so much like my little brother, and the dog so much like one of mine (go ahead, call my family a stereotype). I advise you to watch this on a cinema or any large screen with a good sound system. The movie thrives mostly on unusual visuals and audios. It has its little bads, but it always makes my spirits dance!"
46,The Triplets of Belleville,9,17 March 2011,Brilliant and funny animation movie,"A wonderful humorous animation semi-mute adults movie that tells the story of cyclist Champion, his Grandma, and their unwanted adventures in America. This is a Franco-Belgian-Canadian production which has as main characters a Portuguese grandma, a French cyclist, and three American sisters.There is a huge list of elements to praise, all of which give the movie a special something that keeps you entertained and enchanted, with a big smile in your face. In fact, time flies when watching this movie, and that is always a great sign.The animation looks like old-style hand-made Miyazaki-sort-of-animation, both in style and fluidity of the images, the quirkiness of the characters and the action. On the other hand, the characters are not flashy young super-doodle people, but mostly a group of old women, an overweight dog, and some nasty Mafiosi, all of whom are beautifully (and funnily) drawn. The characters rarely speak, just mumble a few words, make guttural noses, and sing some songs, but they are always very expressive. The story is really well told despite the almost non-existent dialogs.The movie has an awesome soundtrack, with golden-era Jazz and Motown classics, and some classic music pieces that convey the ambiance and atmosphere of the 1920s-50s New York perfectly. In fact, the recreation of New York as Belleville has a lot of art-deco, with a twist of Europe (the skyline of Belleville resembles an European castle) plus a contemporary projection of the image of Americans in European mentality (the inhabitants of Belleville are morbidly obese) creating something that is oddly beautiful and original.Specially brilliant are the scenes of the crossing of the Atlantic, the watching of human programs in TV by the cartoons, the diet of the triplets, and, above all, the surreal black and white dreams of Bruno the dog.The only thing I did not like, which I think it ruined the magic of the film, was the car persecution at the end, which I found childish and resolved in a hurry, and the end.Said this, this is a brilliant movie with a delightful script."
47,The Triplets of Belleville,8,26 November 2008,Absurd but excellent,"The Triplets of Belleville is an absurd yet captivating film. From the moment it began I was intrigued and well entertained until the very end. The animation is unlike anything done before, very original. The colour tones used create a sense of foreshadowing that something bad will happen to the main character and are consistent with the theme of the film. The lack of sound causes one to pay more attention to the animation that is so different from the Disney style that we are used to. The storyline is...interesting to say the least, one that requires an open mind and a sense of humour to enjoy. As far as silent films go, the Triplets of Belleville is a classic. It definitely deserved the Oscar."
48,The Triplets of Belleville,8,25 November 2007,Beautiful details and atmosphere,"I did not know what I was about to see as I set out to see this movie. On this Sunday afternoon I felt like an animation movie, and put Triplettes De Belleville on. As I was watching the beginning, I was already charmed by the consideration for detail in the atmosphere created in the old house.Throughout the whole movie I kept this enthusiasm. Little scenes like the ocean steamer being chased by a water cycle with and old lady and a fat dog did not make me laugh, as this description would imply, but I was actually chasing the big boat too, wanting to catch up and make things right.What struck me as most special, was the depth of the details; so many small things were present, like the different types of frogs when the triplets catch and eat them, but all those details add to the big picture of the movie. Really Nice."
49,The Triplets of Belleville,10,26 May 2007,Funny and well made animation,"There's a young boy, who idolizes cyclists. His grandmother finds his secret scarp book, realizes his dream and gives him his first three cycle. Years later the boy is taking part of the Tour De France, but soon something unexpected happens: two goons capture him and two other cyclists. Why? And where do they take him? The grandmother and a bit tubby dog go after them to the rescue.'Les Triplettes de Bellaville' is as far of a Disney cartoons as the earth is from a sun. The characters are all very styled, rather ugly looking people, with over weight, bottle glasses, huge noses, warts and all that. They people are also very odd and very nicely personalized.The best thing about this animation is, that even though it is French, you don't actually have to understand a word of it, as it doesn't have much of dialog, and the dialog it has bares no real connection to the actual plot, which plays out like a silent film, with out the narrative screens. Alos the animation and musics are very good."
50,The Triplets of Belleville,9,9 September 2006,"Superb animation with excellent music and ""car chase.""",I't difficult to understand the detractors' point of view. I watched this with my kids and we were all enthralled when not laughing out aloud. The characters - especially Bruno the dog - are more rounded than most from Hollywood and the plot is more plausible. That's probably why some uptight Americans may be offended... The film captures Gallic and Belleville (read New York) stereotypes to the point of caricature. The French are not good at enjoying humorous reflection but this is so well done... The DVD came with today's Times newspaper and I bought it because I heard the film features the the Cirtoen 2cv. The best £1 60 (about $3) I've spen in years. The downside? Too short!
51,The Triplets of Belleville,8,22 August 2006,"Unusual, mesmerizing, and definitely something different","I can honestly say that this is one of the most unusual movies I've seen in recent years. Virtually without dialogue, in sepia tones with an art deco aesthetic that makes it a tad gloomy, and with music that haunted me for days later. Yes, it is comic, but the comedy is a tad dark. Also, because of the unusual aesthetics, lack of dialogue, and the darkness of the comedy, I'm betting most kids would be bored. Kinda like how kids never liked Fantasia as much as their parents did. The Triplets of Belleville is ODD, almost ""trippy,"" and isn't for everyone.The plot has been summarized well elsewhere on this site, and I won't repeat it here. But the sacrifices of Grandma for the sake of Le Champion are touching. From the days of raising the young boy, she sought to give everything for his happiness. First a puppy, then a bike. Then her slaving away as his personal trainer and would-be rescuer. Question: Why does Le Champion never look happy? There are definitely aspects to this film I do not understand, but I can watch it over and over."
52,The Triplets of Belleville,8,2 January 2006,Very original film worth every minute!,"The previews I saw for The Triplets of Belleville intrigued me...I said, hey, what is this unique, strange-looking movie? And when I watched it, it didn't disappoint; in fact I would say it was better than I could have imagined because of its originality and humor. The story was interesting and I loved the way all the parts of the story and details came together throughout the movie. I don't want to include any spoilers so I can't say all of the things that I thought were really cool but trust me, you need to watch this movie for yourself and you'll see what I mean. If you watch this movie and don't like it, you are probably either too young or too jaded or your mind is not open...I am a 33 year old female and loved it and so did my 34 year old boyfriend.I would love to see the creators of this film make another one in the same style but somehow make it totally different but that might be hard because this movie is so unique and likable, I'm not sure they could match its greatness. I loved how there was hardly any speaking in the movie as well (for one reason, my boyfriend and I could comment on it without pausing it or missing any dialog). What else can I say but watch The Triplets of Belleville, if you don't like it within the first fifteen minutes, you might as well give up on it because I knew by the first time I laughed, about five or ten minutes in (if that), that I was in for a treat."
53,The Triplets of Belleville,10,25 July 2005,Très bon!,"I loved this animated presentation featuring merged efforts of three countries: Canada, France and Belgium. You have to watch carefully to realize that everything stereotypically French has been highlighted and even exaggerated to get that perfect combination...the faces of the characters for example the musicians (cigarette in mouth while playing), the actions (the athletes faces during the tour de France), the gestures (the stereotype French waiter is bent over so far backwards that it is the best exaggeration I've ever seen!)...it is all so perfectly French...I think it is one of the most clever films I've ever seen! A MASTERPIECE! THE STYLE, THE MOTION, THE ANIMATION, THE SOUND...EVERYTHING SCREAMS GENIUS IN THIS MOVIE! IT SHOULD HAVE WON AN Oscar!"
54,The Triplets of Belleville,9,29 April 2005,A Quirky Delight,"It's kind of hard to describe ""The Triplets of Belleville"" other than to say that it's truly original. It made me long for the days of old-fashioned hand-drawn animation, the kind that Disney revolutionized before turning to CGI. Interestingly enough, there's a car chase scene toward the end of the film that reminded me of ""101 Dalmatians,"" and I said as much to my wife while we were watching it. It was something about the way the cars were drawn and moved, and the color palate in general. Then in the supplementary materials, one of the film's creators cites ""101 Dalmatians"" as an inspiration, so I was able to congratulate myself on my perceptiveness. It doesn't take much to make me happy :) Grade: A-"
55,The Triplets of Belleville,,26 April 2005,My brief review of the film,"A unique animated film, not only in terms of visual style but also in terms of audio style. There is hardly any dialogue during the course of the film, but also hardly any need for any. The film almost magically manages to involve the viewer through the actions of its characters. This places it above films such as 'Shrek', 'Aladdin' and even fellow 2003 animation 'Finding Nemo', all which relied heavily on interesting voice work for added effect. Visually the animation is nothing short of wonderful: realistic and hyperbolic action is juxtaposed to create a superbly surreal feel. The style of comedy is also a juxtaposition: it is sometimes subtly humorous and at others times obviously funny. The Oscar-nominated theme song is nothing short of wonderful too, full of energy and nicely nostalgic at the same time. There is little wrong in this neatly done production, unless you want to criticise it in terms of a somewhat of lack in plot, however the cleverness of the screenplay is enough to overcome this deficiency."
56,The Triplets of Belleville,8,22 April 2005,Tour de France,"Sylvain Chomet,the incredible genius behind ""Les Triplets de Belleville"" has to be congratulated on this magnificent animated film that is so appealing. M. Chomet has created an anime film that rivals the best of the genre. One can relate to the characters of the film from the beginning, as this story will involve the viewer from the start.M. Chomet takes a look at a world through his wonderful characters that have an universal appeal. Mme. Souza and Bruno, her dog, are two of the best realized and life-like subjects one will ever find in this type of film. The brilliant sketches of the film will stay with the viewer long after one finishes watching it. M. Chomet talent lies in the fact that he gets us involved in the film without practically any dialog, just on the strength of the images we are watching. This is a film for everyone thanks to its creator, Sylvain Chomet."
57,The Triplets of Belleville,8,16 April 2005,Unique and passionate film-making.,"""Les Triplettes de Belleville"" is a sublime animated film. We've seen quite many terrific animated films recently but don't expect this one to be anything like the 'Finding Nemo's' or 'Spirited Away's' you love so much. This movie has its very own style and message that simply can't be categorized. ""Les Triplettes..."" is depressing and exhilarating at the same time and totally fills you up with feelings of admiration and deep respect for the artists who're behind it. Apart from some (brilliant) music and spoken announcements, there's no dialogue in this film. Yet, you strangely feel what's going on inside the minds and characters of the designed characters. It's a tale of chasing your dreams, perseverance and brotherly love. Beautifully set in middle-class France, with protagonists constantly fighting poverty, we're introduced to a shy orphan living with his grandmother. The boy never asks for anything but dreams of a cycling career. His grandmother supports him throughout and gives him the possibility to purchase this dream. Several years later, the boy participates in the world-famous Tour de France. The film then takes a bizarre twist and becomes like an odd slow motion action movie slash black comedy. It's really unique and hard to describe so you better watch for yourself. Obviously, the bizarre storyline is secondary to the one of a kind style! ""Les Triplettes de Belleville"" is funny but of course not in a slapstick way. Through situational humor and well-portrayed characters, it often brings a smile to your face without ever going over the top. This is a truly special film and it deserves a lot of praising for its originality. I reckon not everyone will appreciate the slow-paced style but for purchasers of cinema diversity, this is a must!""Les Triplettes..."" is a French, Canadian and Belgian co-production. I'm especially proud to see the latter country's involvement. We Belgians don't mean that much in the field of cinema (especially not the animated field) and it's pleasing to find out about some true artists living here. The magnificent ""Belleville Rendez-Vous"" song will remain stuck in your head for a long time and the positive energy coming from this motion picture will unquestionably impress you. This is film-making like it was intended to be: passionate and with great respect for the audience."
58,The Triplets of Belleville,9,13 April 2005,A masterpiece.,"A masterpiece.This is a cartoon that manages to be very funny but dark and macabre as well.The animation quality is top notch; the feel of the sets reminded me of Disney when they were good. (The Aristocats, lady is a tramp etc.) The cameo appearances of pre-war stars include Josephine Baker, Django Reinhardt, Fred Estair and others. Plus the music is exactly right with subtle references to top players of years gone by. If you are a jazz fan you will love and recognise these.Then there is the dog Bruno, very funny  if you have ever owned a big silly dog then you will recognise him here! Every now and again a milestone film is produced, something original and great, I suspect that this film was a labour of love.Different and great, just 9/10 because the frog sequence was a little too gross for my stomach!"
59,The Triplets of Belleville,9,27 March 2005,A surrealistic tour de force,"This movie intrigued me from the moment I picked up the DVD case. I like anime and American animation, but this movie is that and so much more. The fact that it is a cartoon vanishes under the simple yet powerful story of the indomitable Mme. Souza and Bruno rescuing her grandson from American gangsters. There are many (and many not so subtle) caricatures of the clash between American and French ideals, the past and the present. Witness the lovely pension home of Madam, leaning away from the train tracks that are built into it, with train hating Bruno timing the trains to give them a good barking too. The matre'd at the restaurant was very amusing with his rubber spine. The triplets themselves are sad, yet tough as nails. I found the frog hunting hilarious while depressing. Great dames of the theatre should not end up like that. Best of all, the car chase, right out of a Pink Panther movie. I kept expecting Peter Sellers. And if you can resist the temptation to get up and boogie to the irresistible ""Belleville Rendezvous"" then you are better than I am."
60,The Triplets of Belleville,,18 March 2005,One of the best and only French animations I've seen yet.,"I always consider British Animation very amusing. But French animation is like seeing another side to cartoons. This movie is made in France and very French like.I've heard this movie was extraordinary, so I rented it, and found myself a great movie. The animation is very well done. The plot works very well with or without words. A good number of good scenes in it. Plus the characters are like looking at a twisted cartoon on a foreign newspaper.The music is very catchy. I recommend getting the soundtrack to this film. If you like Foreign films or French like stuff, then I recommend this film. It's one of those movies to see like everyday.I give it 8/10. Suggested for 13 and up. Because this isn't really a kids movie. Contains some inappropriate scenes. But the rest is fine to see."
61,The Triplets of Belleville,,8 November 2004,Waking from a dream,"Sometimes you wake up in the morning with bits of a dream bouncing around your head: you remember that it was weird and funny and emotional and important and you think ""Damn, there's a movie in there somewhere!"". By the time you've had breakfast and got to work the bits of dream have faded. The makers of ""Belleville Rendez-vous"" (English title) gathered up all their bits of weird dream and made a movie out of them. Plot: Four old ladies- the eponymous triplets plus granny, take on the Mafia to recover a kidnapped cyclist. Not a lot of the plot makes any sense in conventional terms, but that's dreams for you! Visuals: Consistently stunning; the palette may tend towards dull greens and browns, but every frame is lovingly drawn with astonishing detail, and lots of little jokes thrown in. Characters: In Bruno, we have the doggiest old dog ever committed to film. You just know that he smells bad, and that you'd put up with his hygiene problems. The way his legs wobble and tremble at key moments is beautifully observed. If you have ever had to care for a smelly, old, lovable mutt, you will instantly connect. Granny (Madame Souza) is an indomitable dwarf, endlessly resourceful, courageous against the odds, and brilliantly realized by the animators. The Triplets are frightening: I was reminded of the witches in Macbeth, but, of course these weird sisters are on our side. (WARNING: do not watch the Frog scene when sitting down to eat). I'm not quite so impressed by Champion- the goal of the quest. He doesn't have much of a personality: I suppose this could reflect the one-dimensional focus of a high-achieving sportsman, but he didn't have much emotional resonance for me. He didn't even respond to being rescued! All in all, this is a startling film, if not a great one, and don't be put off by it's French origin- there isn't a line of meaningful dialogue in the movie- the whole story is related through visuals and non-verbal sounds.My Rating- 8.5 out of 10"
62,The Triplets of Belleville,,4 July 2004,A film student's wet dream,"How do you tell a story that no one has heard before? In a journey film, your hero moves along a road, trying to get from A to B, or fleeing A without a stated goal. Along the way, you can bung in any number of strange encounters  just think of The Wizard of Oz. In what other film could you fit a chorus of midgets, a field of heroin-bearing flowers and a horde of flying monkeys? Sylvain Chomet's new cartoon is similarly brimming with goodies. Our heroine is Madame Souza, a woman with thick jowls and a prominent mole. Bruno, a morose, lard-arse dog, follows her. Madame Souza is a coach. She trails behind her cyclist grandson, blowing a whistle at regular intervals. (There is barely any dialogue: the director relies instead on sound and little curlicues of accordion music.) When a betting racket abducts her grandson during the Tour De France, Bruno and Madame Souza set out to rescue him. They follow him to Belleville, a New York-style city of towering buildings. Here they meet three old ladies, once famous but now reduced to eating frogs and giving concerts with refrigerators.Everyone in this film is hilariously well suited to his task. The cyclists have bulging calves and long, aerodynamic noses. When Madame Souza and grandson finish training of an evening, he hulks over the table, a blanket on his shoulders. There is nothing left over. With his long eyelashes, scrawny limbs and flared nostrils, he suggests a horse. The gangsters have hulking, rectangular shoulders like refrigerators: they are built to intimidate. A little engineer goes crawling through machinery with a wrench: he has the beady eyes and twitching nose of a rat. These characters are good at only one thing. Only Bruno the dog is flexible, his obesity actually an infinite store of energy. He is harnessed to broken-down vehicles, tracks his master through scent and bears Madame Souza on his back.SPOILER ALERTThere is a delirious sense of invention. Late in the movie, we see three cyclists mounted on a platform. They are drugged, looking as they pedal at a country lane projected on a screen. (They actually go nowhere, as if doing cardio at the gym, and the gangsters make bets as to who will keel over first from exhaustion.) The platform breaks loose, and they go sailing away as if on a yacht, still looking dully at the screen. The layers of reality and illusion jangle one against the other. It is a marvellously dense image, a film student's wet dream."
63,The Triplets of Belleville,8,21 April 2004,Mind-blowing,"Seriously, how frequently can you catch such a unique movie experience? ""Belleville"" is a sheer ride of the senses, combining our fantasies, our fears and our imaginations to make a movie that makes us want to let go and dream about it. I think it should be specially effective to everyone who was a kid in 1960's france, and in my opinion, the collective imagination of those years in that country are the building blocks of this picture. I was mesmerized by such an unusual amount of imagination, and such an explanation to questions like: ""why do animation movies exist?"" and ""why is traditional animation still worth while?"". In the USA it seems difficult for people to understand this, and impossible for them to make a movie as daringly dark and expressionistic as this. Amazing experience, which allows you to go over the entire spectrum of emotions you are willing to unleash."
64,The Triplets of Belleville,,4 March 2004,"Well done, funny cartoon with heart.","I love it when I get to review a well done, creative film. It is a seldom occurance. In the case of ""The Triplets of Belleville"" I will write about a wonderful, heartwarming, funny movie. The story revolves around a mother and son who live in a single dwelling in Paris. The mother loves him very much. The son becomes a competator in the Tour De France.During the race, he gets kidnapped by some gambling ring. The plot then starts to develop. The mother follows the kidnappers, with the help of her dog, to the seaside city of Belleville. In Belleville, she and the dog are invited to stay with the Triplets of Belleville, a group of Burlesque performers.There are alot of impressive parts of this film. The scene at Tour De France, where the son is kidnapped, is visually captivating. The scene in which the mother and dog are at sea, folowing the massive ship that holds the kidnappers, is beautiful. The scene which introduces the kidnappers is hilarious. The scene which shows the mother and dog joining the Triplets for a meal is both disturbing and poignant. The scene where we find out why the son was kidnapped is stunning. And, I have to mention the final climax. It is the best few minutes of the film. From the beginning until the final frame, it is exciting and marvolous.I wish I knew the name of the writer and director, so I could give him some well deserved credit. I know that he is French-Canadian. And, I know that he received a Acadamy Award nomination for best animated film. I send him congradulations on a great achievement. This is one amazing film. Josh Weinman, Video Production Student"
65,The Triplets of Belleville,7,26 February 2004,Delightful,"That is the best word I can use to describe this movie. What we have here is a visual and aural feast, with a charming plot and somewhat misguided direction.The thing I can't understand for the life of me is how people are painting it as some sort of social commentary. The Americans are very fat... and so are the French (the ones in this movie). The French eat cheese and drink wine. The Americans eat hamburgers and there are some sleazy apartment complexes in New York. Oh what commentary! Such observations have never been made before! My feathers are rifled and my underwear is bunched!Pardon my sarcasm, but this movie just has a very exaggerated style throughout, and in my opinion anyone who is focusing on its ""criticism"" of certain cultures is missing an extremely entertaining film. The Triplets features what has to be the best soundtrack I've heard in a film in quite some time, and the theme will be stuck in my head until I can get my hands on the CD (at least I hope there's a CD of the soundtrack!). The parts with the Triplets themselves are so charming, and pleasing to the ear, that I only wish they were in the movie more often.Which ties in with my only criticism of the movie, the pacing and direction are off, as many people have commented. At times the Triplets leaves you wondering how long you'll have to wait before another brilliant scene comes along, and at other times it throws so much brilliance at you at once that you can't keep up no matter how hard you try. The story is nowhere near fleshed out enough in some areas, and far too fleshed out in others. And we need more musical numbers from the Triplets!While the animation is jaw-dropping, and the mixing of different media such as cell shading is cutting edge, I honestly didn't care for the style of the art very much. The cyclists, in my opinion, just looked creepy. The constantly fat and/or dentally impaired characters got too over the top fairly quickly. Despite the fact I wasn't a fan of the style, I still found the film very enjoyable simply because of the quality of the animation. Also, I did enjoy watching some characters, such as the mafia goons and the grandmother.In the end the Triplets of Belleville leaves you feeling like you just ate the most extravagant, over-indulgent, delicious cake you've ever come across. It was very lacking in the basic food groups needed to make a meal fulfilling, and you know you got very little of substance from the feast. Still, you'll be damned if you didn't stuff your face."
66,The Triplets of Belleville,8,22 February 2004,Frog-Ka-Bob,"Greetings again from the darkness.  What a visual delight!  This is one of the most bizarre, unique, fascinating movies I have seen.  The animation is of another world and the characters all have exaggerated features - noses, heads, calfs, etc.  The dog, Bruno, is magnificent and full of life.  Madame Souza, the grandmother and heroine of the story just keeps you glued to the screen.  Can't say that I envy the Triplets cuisine, but their music kept me humming after the movie was over.  This is not ""Toy Story"" or ""Bambi"".  This world is unlike any I have seen from animation.  The sinister characters will creep you out and the Triplets are a joy to behold - I was cracking up watching them watch TV!  This should be seen by those who love animation or those who have no idea.  Wonderful story with great visuals and very little dialogue.  Hollywood could learn something!"
67,The Triplets of Belleville,8,11 February 2004,Creative effort,"Nominated for Best Animated Feature, this little foreign film is actualy somewhat interesting. The clunky animation works for the style and the almost silent film is actualy pretty amusing, if at times a tad slow. Still, it's a creative work and deserves it's nomination. GRADE: B+"
68,The Triplets of Belleville,,15 July 2003,why the character design ???,"This movie has a peculiar look indeed. The animation is great, the sceneries are breathtaking, the colors are beautiful, but the character design just sucks.It reminds me of those old caricatures from the late 18th century: big noses, huge ears and so on. I was at times almost disgusted by the looks and the attitudes of those strange lobotomized-looking characters who never talked and ate garbage-looking food.   Big disappointment if you ask me!"
69,The Triplets of Belleville,8,15 July 2003,superb but a bit cold,"France was awaiting for years the sequel to the superb short-film ""La vieille dame et les pigeons"", Sylvain Chomet knew the situation and decided to go further in non-sense and visual gags, wonderful characters and magnificent backgrounds.The result is ""Les triplettes de Belleville"", a strange and odd experience into a very personal universe. But be aware: this movie is not a comedy, or maybe it is a very dark comedy (Tim Burton is not far in some specific moments).I give this movie 8 out of 10."
70,The Triplets of Belleville,1,30 November 2005,Not at all what i expected (sadly),"I find that the average rating of a movie on this site is usually quite a good gauge of how good a film is but i found myself disagreeing on this one, I have to say that i found this film charmless, ugly and very irritating.I have read some intelligent and articulate comments in praise of the movie, and in light of those comments i gave it a second watch, but the movie still infuriated me. The characters all left me cold, the music annoyed me, and the animation, while different from the anodyne world of Walt Disney, bordered on the grotesque. Not at all what i had expected"
71,The Triplets of Belleville,3,21 October 2003,uninspired,"I really wanted to like this film.  I felt that it broke away from traditions, had moments of true genius, and could have been something really special.  However, as it failed to provide aural stimulation in the form of speech i thought it should have provided visual stimulation which it fails to do.  Now don't get me wrong, i thought that the animation was superb, reminiscent of the dream sequence in dumbo, full of caricatures.  The pace of the film throughout assumed a kind of lethargy, with each shot feeling drawn out and overlong.  I felt at first that it was surrealist humour, then realised the few moments of humour were so few and far between as not to justify that title. Very disappointing, as i thought more was possible."
72,The Triplets of Belleville,4,4 September 2010,grotesque art for grotesque arts sake,"With beautiful animation, distinct visual style and a very unusual atmosphere, Triplets has a lot to offer to a patient viewer. Only problem is that it servers no purpose in the context of it all. The film tells, well, some sort of story that has really no impact on the viewer apart from a few well choreographed scenes. People that are part of that story are silent, grotesque, deformed. World they are in is bleak, depressing and offering very few, and oh so pretentiously artsy, laughs. Film moves on slowly, creepily, pointlessly. If u want to enjoy it on purely artistic level, you will have to endure annoying sounds of the minutiae. There is a scene (more or less any scene) where a grotesque character is eating. And he is eating away, minutes on end. And his every spoonful is audible to the point of annoyance.This film is not intellectually challenging no matter how hard it is trying to be, its just a bad, second rate film with repulsive characters, annoying sounds, and Lynchian atmosphere of dread brought on by ugly sights and sounds wrapped in a distinct, beautifully animated package. Boredom and frustration may result after watching this film."
73,The Triplets of Belleville,5,22 February 2004,Beautiful animation with a plot that sleepwalks at times.,The animation is beautiful.  That I would like to say first and foremost. But the plot in this movie never really goes anywhere.  It is eighty minutes long and I would have much rather seen it become an amazing 20 minute film.  Maybe I just don't appreciate the animation enough to thoroughly enjoy this one.  After all the great reviews I read in anticipation of this film I was very disappointed once I finally got to see it.  The End.
74,The Triplets of Belleville,1,19 January 2004,"In a word, awful","This film is one for all the art house types who find unfunny jokes in French hilarious in English.  I thought I'd enjoy this prior to watching it, oh how wrong I was. The majority of the audience were middle aged Guardian readers who laughed out loud throughout the film, I should have spotted the signs  and left early. The film and audience were for the most part utterly pretentious.It is quite simply awful, one of the worst films I've ever seen."
75,The Triplets of Belleville,1,16 December 2008,"Disgusting, Pointless, Over-hyped","I've read that animation is the ultimate realization of imagination, and I have to agree. However, just because you imagine something to look like THIS does not make it interesting. Sylvain Chomet is like that kid who sits in the back of third grade scribbling bizarre pictures in his notebook just for the hell of it while the other kids marvel at him for being so 'imaginative.' Apparently he never grew up (nor did the people who are blown away by this film's disgusting visuals. yes, this includes the Oscars). If by the end of the film you don't care for the protagonists, then what was the point? Actually, by the end of the film I would have loved to have seen the mutant grandson shot dead. I have the same problem with the Lord of the Rings. Sometimes films win awards just for existing, not because they deserve it. They are all fluff and no meat. Triplets of Belleville is disgusting, pointless, and over-hyped. Being French and weird does not make it good."
76,The Triplets of Belleville,1,1 August 2004,WHY????,"I don't see why the reviews are so great for this movie. Okay, the animation was quirky and different, which is why I wanted to see it in the first place. And the (only) song was pretty catchy. Of course I also wanted to see it because I had mistakenly assumed that there might be some kind of plot (silly me), and I had heard that it was funny. Last time I trust that source. Sure, I may have chuckled at a few things, but nothing really funny.The whole France hates America thing got really old really fast. I don't mind the reference, but after a while it was just the same thing over and over. None of the characters were well developed, so through the entire movie, the viewer is kind of detached. Makes it hard to become interested. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did."
77,The Triplets of Belleville,1,16 June 2003,Disappointing hand-made cartoon,"I expected much of Les Triplettes de Belleville, but the result did not meet my expectations. Hand-drawn characters are very differently animated than the computer-generated objects appearing here and there, making a noticeable and probably unintentional difference in style.Little to no dialog prevented the plot to be more than basic. Humorous notes are repeated over and over and characters are especially unidimensional. The result is bland.But what repelled me the most is the large use of stereotypes, to the point of racism, particularly noticeable in all scenes where Americans are depicted: stupid, obscenely obese slobs. Even the Statue of Liberty is depicted as an overly fat woman holding a hamburger.If it's the best cartoon French can make, competition don't need to worry."
78,The Triplets of Belleville,5,26 August 2008,Very unusual and clever but also not particularly pleasant viewing,"When I saw this film, I really wanted to love it. After all, I adore French films as well as animation so I really thought I'd found an excellent film for me. At first, I was quite happy, as the animation style and quality were very nice. I particularly liked the quirky way that people were drawn as well as the nice muted colors. There was also a funny and odd sensibility about the film that made me smile....for a while. Then, I noticed that unfortunately the film never really achieved anything. It just went on and on with practically no dialog (which is fine) and a story that just seemed to drag (which isn't so fine). In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the film seemed very happy at its own cleverness and never really tried to come up with an interesting story or one you could show to children. In fact, the film is exceptionally dark and rather cruel at times--with a plot that late in the film resembles the brilliant independent film, 13 TZAMETI. However, 13 TZAMETI is a film no child would watch nor would any sane parent let them watch this ultra-dark film--while unsuspecting parents might naturally assume that since THE TRIPLETS is a cartoon that it's a kids' movie. Despite a few clever touches here and there, this is certainly not a kids film. Nor, now that I think about it, is THE TRIPLETS a film for even the average viewer. Dark, quirky and with a plot that, at times, is practically non-existent, I just couldn't get into this film and found myself amazingly bored. Pretty and interesting but just not particularly pleasant viewing."
79,The Triplets of Belleville,7,22 July 2004,"interesting, sublime, acid?","Just finishing the movie, I seem to find a hard time remarking on it. Breathtakingly beautiful, stunning visuals, but I found it weak in plot. Did I mind the basically silent film? No, I found that amazing. Did I hate the anti-American sub plots? No, I loved them. Actually I found more humor in that then anything else in the movie, just plan entertainment. I will probably change my mind in the morning, but it seems like something I should have watched when I was 15 and messing around with acid, something like ' The wall '. I don't know, just seems like I would get more out of it on an altered state. Shucks that I know now what that stuff does to you, and won't be able to see it in the way I see it should be watched...great though 7/10..."
80,The Triplets of Belleville,6,9 February 2004,M'eh....,"I don't remember ever being so underwhelmed by a movie that was as universally acclaimed as this movie.  Don't get me wrong.  The animation is, at times, stunning and the characters are very engaging.  It's also obvious that there was a lot of thought put into every little aspect of the film. It's just that the overall vibe I got from the movie was one of self-importance.  Instead of simply telling an interesting story (which this movie has got in spades), there are too many detours into pretention.  The literal transformations and representations in the movie made me roll my eyes more than once (i.e.: old men literally turn into monkeys while leering over a showgirl, a Fred Estaire-esque dancer is literally eaten by his dancing shoes, a pile of excrement is in the shape of Mickey Mouse's head...)  I think this is the reason that Pixar is by far the leader of the animation world.  You never feel that they've got anything to prove.  They simply tell a story in the best way possible.  Pixar is smart without trying to wear that ingenuity on their sleeve.  This is a trait that would have served ""Triplets"" well.  The story and the characters are well drawn (literally and figuratively), however, their charm is undermined by the film's overwhelming need to be smart and quirky.  Next time, just tell the story."
81,The Triplets of Belleville,,4 January 2004,A Very Strange Animated Trip and the Slowest 80 Minutes,"""The Triplets of Belleville"" is a very different kind of animated movie that is not conventional in any way.  My sister, brother-in-law, and I are all fans of animated movies, but clearly not this kind.  We saw this movie at Manhattan's Lincoln Plaza, and for sure, there wasn't a single youngster there, so naturally this was not made for children in mind.   The film was conceived and directed by Sylvain Chomet.  The drawings are from the old-fashioned Disney pen-and-ink mainly from ""101 Dalmations"" in an age of computer-animated films, the sensibilities are borrowed from those of the Betty Boop cartoons and some classic Tex Avery cartoons, and there is a surprising amount of pervesity a la Ralph Bakshi (always remember that the name Bakshi means ""no kids cartoons) such as a topless dancer and animal cruelty, which I'll get to later.   As for this slow-moving 80 minute movie, to make this long story short, it is about an orphan raised by his doting grandmother named Madame Souza who gives him a bicycle and then trains and feeds him rigorously enought to compete in the Tour de France races, and naming him Champion.  Once there, a tired Champion walks into a truck driven by two men both drawn to resemble the Men in Black.  These men work for the French Mafia and kidnap Champion all the way to Belleville for the Mafia's own version of the Tour De France, where they bet on Champion and two other victims for self-profit in a gambling hall.  When Madame Souza learns about this, she and her dog, Bruno, leaves Paris and enters Belleville, where she encounters her favorite dance hall trio a la the Andrews Sisters from the 1930's, now haggard old crones, and Madame Souza, the triplets, and the dog search everywhere for Champion.   Now what makes this movie so strange?  This movie first begins with the triplets singing and dancing, and in the middle of the act, Josephine Baker comes in and dances topless, and Fred Astaire comes in and dances, only to be eaten alive by his shoes.  As for the town of Belleville, it is a strange metropolis that looks like New York, with many fat denizens, and their Statue of Liberty resembles a fat man eating a hamburger, thus making fun of the obese.  The Triplets live in a squalid fly-infested apartment and live solely on an all-frog diet, blowing up all the frogs at a nearby swamp and cooking them to death.  Also the animal cruelty comes in as well as the treatment of frogs where Madame Souza is seen riding on her dog.  I would also like to add that my sister and I kept looking at our watch, although the movie is short. What makes it slow is that there is minimal action, minimal dialogue that almost plays like a silent movie and has only one line uttered (Remember when mime Marcel Marceau had the only speaking part in Mel Brooks' ""Silent Movie?""), one song and dance number sung in French, and one has to figure out the plot through its actions.  The two interesting parts in this movie were where Madame Souza blows her whistle to rescue Champion from the race, and the French Mafia, the coolest mafia who upstages all the bland main characters.  I liked how they all wore oversized shoulder-pads, looked like the Men in Black, lit cigarettes stylishly, and walked to ominous music.  Other than the Mafia, forget it!"
82,The Triplets of Belleville,6,19 June 2003,"Great drawings but a bit slow, for another generation maybe","The movie is slow to get to the point and would be appreciated best by people around 50-60. You need to know France after the World War II and the feeling of the Tour de France, ""Yvette a l'accordeon"", the mafia guys like ""armoires a glace"", the banana outfit of Josephine, the tap dancer, and so many more details. The music is great, drawings are great. It is like a good artistic comic. It is kind of a slow dark movie but it shows that with motivation you can go over the limits and of course the turtle still gets to the end of the race. This movie is in shades of grey. That's probably why I liked it. No black and white feelings, just life. Of course it has to be simplified since there is almost no word spoken."
83,The Triplets of Belleville,8,25 November 2017,A hilarious callback to silent films,"This was the final movie I had received from my brother as a gift. As usual, we spent time today viewing it. I came into this movie not knowing what to expect at all, considering the DVD case had an awkward focus. Anyway, what lies inside?One thing inside is a story that offers a minuscule quantity of darkness (there is one scene that is genuinely horrifying while most of the others are either surreal or just strange), some action at the end, and highly effective humor that emulates those of 40's and 50's cartoons (think Tom & Jerry or Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies style slapstick). Going on with the humor, it also incorporates more contemporary visual gags such as a noticeable but not distractingly high amount of gross-out. It all comes with just sporadic dialogue, but is paced and conveyed in a manner that the plot is easier to understand than other films with infrequent voicing (one of the reasons why I wasn't overly pleased with The Red Turtle). The eponymous Triplets, while not the main characters, are indeed the true stars of this movie, for they provide the most memorable ideas in how Madame Souza learns about their lifestyle and contribute to the humor during the action segment at the end. While Mme Souza, Champion, and Bruno are indeed the focus very early on, and do have an interesting story, I honestly felt that the Triplets were the characters who made this movie; after all, they are The Triplets of Belleville. The animation features mostly hand-drawn environments that are interspersed with cel-shaded objects and CGI effects, including the characters in the Tour de France scene. It works exquisitely as a style combination and marvelously enhances the visual gags such as Belleville's counterpart of the Statue of Liberty. There is the music too, which isn't too memorable but is undeniably catchy and, conceptually, is ear candy. The Triplets' music reminds me a lot of the occasional street bands we get in the Loop, as they use scrap to play a type of music only the stone-brained could ignore. Frankly, it was a pristine connection to have.If you enjoy French animation, movies that are on the opposite side of the character dialogue spectrum than Planes, 30's to 40's style movies, or even animation in general, I'm sure there is something in this film that will make you walk out pleased. Granted it isn't too ambitious, but probably reservation was the best thing for this movie considering how its setting was like that IRL. I enjoyed it, and you might too."
84,The Triplets of Belleville,9,5 August 2017,Animals being animals for a change.,"One of the best films I've seen in a while, certainly far outshines other animation features witnessed of late. True animal characteristics for a change. Hugely imaginative, great entertainment, had me laughing out-loud. Three thumbs up!PS: I've gone off frog soup."
85,The Triplets of Belleville,10,27 December 2016,What an amazing film,"A fantastic film, which makes you feel depressed, and feel nostalgia. Amazing and straight forward story, minimalistic yet realistic animation, which critiques the lives' of the modern man, with deep meanings and many references to the life in the 50's. The caricatures of the mafia, and the over caring grandmother are hilarious. The movie also is very depressing. If you watch it till the end, you instantly have a feeling in your stomach, especially after the last scene. The deterioration of the house, is also extremely saddening, and you really root for the characters, mostly for the granny. I recommend you watch it and be prepared for an emotional roller coaster."
86,The Triplets of Belleville,7,8 December 2015,Beautifully ugly,"Madame Souza and her grandson used to watch the singing Triplets of Belleville on TV. She raises her orphaned grandson by herself and encourages him to be a great cyclist. He enters the Tour de France. He and others are kidnapped and shipped to a criminal boss who runs his own tour with stationary bikes. Souza and their overweight dog Bruno follow the ship to Belleville where they are befriended by the eccentric frog-eating Triplets of Belleville. While performing with the Triplets at a nightclub, Bruno sniffs out his owner's scent on the mob boss.I love the unique ugly style that is done so beautifully. It's wonderfully weird and surreal. I don't think the story moves fast enough. There is a lack of urgency at times. There is more than one dream sequence for the dog. This is an unique vision but the slower scenes get a bit repetitive. The lack of dialog is another part of that uniqueness."
87,The Triplets of Belleville,9,30 April 2015,How do I begin?,"I remember the first time I watched this movie, it was with my parents when I was around 10 or 11, and I remember thinking, ""what the hell just happened?"" and you may too, after the first time. This largely wordless animation comes from the great Sylvain Chomet, a brilliant animator who's only other full length movie is The Illusionist, which is just as good and should be checked out if you like this one. To summarize, this film is pretty far out there in obscurity, most people I've asked about have never heard about it, and it's pretty easy to see why. The film is chock full of bizarre quirks and weird happenings, I won't deny it, and the character models are incredibly ugly and deformed, but you have to agree there is some level of charm to them, and the setting is beautiful. I could gush about this movie for hours, but please give it a shot, its something else."
88,The Triplets of Belleville,8,7 April 2015,"A Catchy, Rock-Solid Animated Adventure That Hearkens Back to the Moods and Methods of Yesteryear","Quirky, standout French animation about a boy, his grandmother, his dream of competing in the Tour de France, and his kidnapping midway through the race. Somewhere along the way, they latch onto a trio of retired songstresses (the titular triplets) and from there, the ride grooves to a catchy, incessant makeshift beat. A free-flowing adventure in every sense, it's never half as serious as the premise seems to imply - even when the crew is dodging bullets in New York aboard the equivalent of a parade float. The artwork is wonderful; organic and over-exaggerated in the very best ways, and all-too willing to poke fun at its own eccentricities. Stylish, funny and emotive, with a colorful soul and a restless spirit, I was especially impressed by its ability to convey the story without a shred of essential dialog. No subtitles necessary, just enjoy the show."
89,The Triplets of Belleville,9,15 December 2014,"Inventive, beautiful and hilarious","Belleville Rendezvous is the debut feature film from French animator Sylvain Chomet. Like its equally impressive follow-up, The Illusionist, it's a highly original and beautiful piece of work. Its story tells of a boy and his grandmother Madame Souza who live in the French countryside. One day she buys him a bicycle and it becomes his obsession. Fast forward a few years and he is competing in the Tour de France but is kidnapped by mysterious Mafia types and taken to the city of Belleville to be used as part of an elaborate gambling scheme. Madame Souza and Champion's faithful dog Bruno set off to rescue him.There are two things that make this film an absolute delight  its wonderfully inventive and quite beautiful artwork and its extremely effective sense of humour. The animation is consistently wonderful and the backdrops gorgeous. It feels so very French and incredibly authentic; it has a real organic feeling to it. The characters which populate this world are brilliantly rendered too. The relationship between Madame Souza and her grandson Champion is genuinely heart-warming, while both generate many laughs  especially funny to me was Madame Souza blowing her whistle at the mechanic who fixes her vehicle in order for him to up his pace. But funniest of all is Bruno, who has to be the all-time best animated dog ever; what makes him so good is that despite being a cartoon, he actually behaves hilariously realistically dog-like throughout. We follow his daily routines and, again, he is entirely believable and lovable. Once we arrive in the big city we encounter The Triplettes of Belleville and the gangsters; the former are an unforgettable trio of eccentric tall old ladies who in one highlight perform a musical routine purely using household items, while the gangsters are very original too, with the box-like heavies and rodent-faced engineer being particularly good. Even peripheral characters are greatly amusing, such as the fawning waiter who literally bends over backwards for his customers! The humour throughout, is inspired and the world created a fantastically original one.I think you would be hard pressed to find another animated film that combines visual invention, artistic beauty, musical innovation and laugh-out-loud humour as effectively as Belleville Rendezvous. It's a real joy."
90,The Triplets of Belleville,9,30 November 2014,In defense of the Triplets of Belleville,"I loved this animated feature. Often to get a feel for divergent viewpoints I read the reviews from people who ""hated it"". One reviewer said that it was ""anti-American"" and the only indication I found that America may have been involved was the brief appearance of an obese statue of Liberty holding a green hamburger skyward. Americans Josephine Baker and Fred Astaire seemed to have gotten the better of by tuxedo-ed monkeys and carnivorous shoes respectively, to be sure, but clearly jazz is something that the French seem to be more enamored of than we Americans. I didn't find that insulting at all, just delightfully goofy much like the old black and white Betty Boop cartoons.Bruno the dog was worth the price of admission. What a wonderfully goofy dog and a very dog-like dog at that, doing dog-like things such as scrambling upstairs to bark at passing trains. And the dog's dream sequences? Just amazing. You didn't need the dogs to talk nor the humans either, to get the gist of things.The grandmother was really the star of the show, very resourceful and determined. She morphs into his trainer as he grows up and propels him relentlessly following behind him on her tricycle and blowing her whistle. She does her own thing and in her own way and does not take kindly to being helped across the street by any presumptuous boy scouts. She also has unexpected musical abilities as it turns out.There were some things that were a bit strange, but then one of the strengths of animated films is its ability to lapse into surrealism, after all things don't HAVE to make sense all the time do they?Needless to say the strangest characters of all were the triplets. Three old ladies living together in a disreputable part of Belleville next to the elevated trains (at which Bruno finds endless fascination barking). The old ladies are unquestionably strange but the take home lesson is that even though you may be eccentric and like to use hand grenades to catch frogs in the lagoon, you still can have a good heart.In short what some people consider weird, is to me just an offbeat sense of humor. In a word delightful. People who hated this feature really need to grow a sense of humor."
91,The Triplets of Belleville,9,14 September 2014,Wonderfully weird: grandma the indomitable,"For me this film represented tradition. Tradition of animation, French and American cultural traditions, the tradition that gives you a purpose in life, but then becomes oppressive and finally corrupted by money.A film done in 2003, it presents a style of animation that is reminiscent of early Disney, but more grotesque. None of the characters are even remotely beautiful and the world is shown as consumerist, crowded with ugly people, polluted by industry and corrupted by human nature. The story, while funny, is irrelevant; instead the details are the ones that count. I loved the ""origin story"" of the train barking and tiny details that pop up all over the film: the boyscout, the Disney castle fireworks thing, the unstoppable ""mémè"" and many more.Bottom line: almost devoid of meaningful dialogue, this piece of artistic animation works on many levels at once. It is not a children cartoon, nor is it some easy film to be watched with hamburgers and French fries (even if, based on the story, it seems to me to be the perfect menu for watching it). I loved it and hated it at the same time and now, writing the review, I feel haunted by the images. You should watch this."
92,The Triplets of Belleville,6,20 January 2014,Peculiar...,"The first time I saw this movie, I was in high school and it was the first foreign film I had ever seen. As there was hardly any dialogue, I was able to focus on the story-line, as well as on the details of the animation. I found the animation to be highly surreal and similar to the style of caricatures. This movie was hard for me to watch because I didn't know where to focus my eyes, due to the fact that I had never seen anything like it before. While it's not a movie that I want to watch again, it is great for everyone to see at least once. It is a very creative film, with many assets, it is just not for me. However, I very much enjoyed seeing a foreign perspective on the US, not something I see often!"
93,The Triplets of Belleville,10,5 November 2013,10 years later,"For 10 years ago this animated movie had been released.This is a movie about a woman, her son and a dog.Not much is said through the movie, but you get some strange songs and whistles instead.The boy grows up to be a Tour De France star, but some American gangsters kidnaps that boy.That makes the woman and the dog sail to America.We see a parody of steam punk technology America with overweight people, large cars and burgers.The woman is teaming up with three older ladies that chases down the villains.At the climax cars are blown up under a chase through the city.If you are in love with Paris, parodies on America and strange European movies I recommend this.There are things for action movie and classic cartoon fans too with the wild chases in this movie.Japan are having Miyazaki, America Disney and France a cartoon likes this.If you hunger for more delicate French speaking animation a lot had been released last decade.10/10"
94,The Triplets of Belleville,9,29 March 2013,"Lovely link to ""Strangers in Good Company""","Loved this movie for years and just saw a 1990 Canadian Indie - ""Strangers in Good Company"" - that obviously inspired some of the title characters. The older film portrays eight woman who get stranded in the Canadian outback for several days. Several of them dance... and catch frogs! And at least two of them look just like the triplets. Nice. Recall that Triplets includes a Montreal/New York blended city on this side of the pond. Both films also celebrate the spirit of older women. I believe Triplets was dedicated to the grandmothers like the one who is a hero in the movie. And of course the Triplets themselves are faded stars from perhaps the 1930s."
95,The Triplets of Belleville,9,22 January 2012,That song was stuck in my head for days...,"From its opening sequence The Triplets of Belleville is a hyperkinetic riot, a near-wordless stream of action and animation that is simply a pleasure to watch. It's not an unmitigated, unrealistic joy -- the setting is distinctly grimy, and there's the general feeling of a lost golden era in distant, hazy memory.But in the end, the cloudy surroundings only make the joy of the film more powerful. The Triplets of Belleville is ultimately a cry to reclaim that raw joy we see so often in the pop culture of days gone by, that maybe didn't ever exist in reality, but perhaps if we try hard enough, life can be joyous again for the first time. That the plot is insubstantial and the denouement non-existent seems to only make the film more energetic, as it dispatches with all the unpleasant formalities to get down to what, it suggests, cinema should be: unfettered fun."
96,The Triplets of Belleville,10,21 September 2010,A feast,"Visually it's full of surprises but it's just the great advantage of animation over traditional cinema: you can add so much more details. It's also rich by some mixing of techniques and the use of different drawing styles. But even without this, the drawings of the main style are purely amazing (there is especially, but definitely not as sole example, a fantastic perspective from above during the Tour de France's climbing of the Mont Ventoux). And musically of course, it's another of these film feasts I enjoy. I cheated, I have to admit, as I know the soundtrack since its release. And am a fan from the first hearing. This musical aspect obviously helped the film to conquer me, but it's really not the only reason. First the music is not just a background, it's a secondary theme (or the real main one, skillfully hidden behind the excuse of finding Champion back). So it is really a plus to listen to it with the images in front of you (especially when the Triplets and Souza are playing together). Second, at the beginning it's full of loneliness and misery, and consequently sad. But around the Tour de France, it turns in a burlesque thing (though there is still loneliness and misery I think). Among other things the burlesque comes from a brilliant exploitation of reciprocal stereotypes about France and America (French are alcohol sponges eating frogs and American are fat, essentially). It's then keeping you laughing, out loud, very much out loud, as efficiently as a clown. And this is definitely the talent of a story, not of a soundtrack"
97,The Triplets of Belleville,9,1 August 2010,A delightful animation with almost no dialogue,"This French animation is very different to any other animated film I can think of, in many ways it felt like an extended version of early cartoon; the story is told through sound and pictures with almost no dialogue. From a young age Champion has dreamt of competed in the Tour de France and his grandmother helps him train until one day his dream comes true, unfortunately he is one of three riders who get kidnapped by the French Mafia. Aided by trusted hound Bruno Grandma sets off to rescue him even though this entails following a ship across an ocean in a pedello. Once across the sea she can't afford any food but as she sits playing a tune on a broken bicycle wheel she is met by the Triplets of Belleville, a strange cabaret act. She lives with these women until Brono finds the scent of Champion and they mount a raid on the theatre where Champion and the two other riders are being forced to ride in a strange simulated cycle race.This film was a visual treat from start to finish and demonstrated that dialogue isn't required to tell a story. The animation is great in a mostly retro style although there is some good CGI mixed in too. There are some good laugh out loud moments such as when one of the triplets goes frog hunting by throwing a grenade into the water. At no point in this film did I feel bored and the story was easy to follow even without dialogue."
98,The Triplets of Belleville,10,29 July 2010,Fantastic,"You've seen this, right? I mean, you have seen it? Just checking. Because I only saw it the other day. No-one had ever told me. I don't say there was any big conspiracy against me; they just all assumed I knew. So I'm just checking you know, in case you only find out about it later and you're cross.Someone had tried to tell me recently, actually, but I just curled my lip and thought, 'Huh, I bet it's not that good.' Because most things, I find, are rubbish. And that's actually a good attitude with which to start to watch a film. It saves on disappointment, and the rare occasions when you're startled out of it the surprise adds to the joy. So I'll try not to build this up too much. And I don't want to give anything away. Just... watch it.This must be a universal work of art. There must be Afghan warlords who love this. This is the real thing. If you work or aspire to work in a creative field, the chances are you'll watch it and think, 'I want to do something like that, I must try harder,' with a happy gratitude innocent of any jealousy.It's at once classic and completely original. It's often hilarious. It's inventive and refreshing. It's... the necessary words get overused until they're meaningless. This deserves them."
99,The Triplets of Belleville,10,28 July 2010,A drop of elegance,"This movie is a summary of elegance, sweetness and truth. With an old style drawing and a perfect soundtrack, it describes with just one story, the story of all us.Its pretty much a silent film: you can watch it in the original language even if you don't know the french. You need just to follow the drawing and the music.And you can find yourself in each character: a little piece of yourself. The dream of the children, who grow up with the same dream. The old and strong mother. The three actresses, and their sad happiness. You can find yourself even in the dog. With his simple life. And his simple problem.Like all us."
100,The Triplets of Belleville,8,27 July 2010,"Make it a point to rendez-vous with Belleville Rendez-Vous, a magnificent French animation which bites off and successfully chews an array of content and ideas.","Watching Belleville Rendez-Vous is an extraordinary experience, a film rich in imagery and a many number of memorable visuals; a harrowing tale of kidnap and rescue; a very funny comedy; an animation, first and foremost, which further still blurs the boundaries between surrealism and pained degrees of realism; a musical; a film about a family unit striving to get by and, perhaps most jarring, a border-line silent film, a film in which the characters communicate by way of hand signals and gestures informing others of what they mean. Not for one second does this international effort, although from the pen and mind of Frenchman Sylvain Chomet, feel disparate; misguided nor inconsistent, perfectly blending every element; every pastiche; every reference and every tone it takes on with everything else so as to create one of the animated films of the last dozen or so years. In a year in which Finding Nemo won more plaudits and box office return, and was at least similar thematically in its covering of a concerned parent doing their utmost to rescue a taken family member, The Belleville Rendez-Vous isn't scared of what it wants to be and shows more bravery and verve whilst maintaining a darker, grimmer, more adult overall sense. Kidnapp and the bond a parent might have with their youngsters are mature themes, here explored under the correct canopy rather than the rather childish, colour strewn, easy going lark Finding Nemo was. Pardoning the pun, this film blows Finding Nemo out of the water.The film's mind-games begin early, with what looks like a short cartoon; here is a short piece full of Dali inspired imagery and uncanny characters adopting obscure characteristics doing some rather inhuman things. At the forefront are three young and wide eyed women dancing and singing, in perfect tandem, a song linked to the title. One of the film's minor joys is discovering, much later on, that these three women were in fact real; further toying with the audience without for a second alienating them. Up until this point, however, the film will revolve around elderly woman Madame Souza and her orphaned grandson named Champion; someone whom maintains a downcast state for most of the time before things perk up when a puppy they name Bruno is bought and later still when grandma buys him a bicycle.If the mock-cartoon was supposed to represent this extravagant and razzmatazz laden world full of energy; colour and vibrancy a million miles away from those that were watching it, then the switching off of the television as a more down-to-Earth life in a rural space in a small home shared by two people that kicks in is clear in its establishing how detached the locales are from one another. Here are people with problems; grieving and living under humbling conditions, so when one of them unwittingly lands in this razzmatazz fuelled world we feel they're punching above their weight and that sense of scale in who it is they're dealing with is effectively put across. Additionally, I think it's deliberate from Chomet that we align ourselves with the canine character of Bruno, from the early stages and pretty much throughout, having been dropped headfirst into this strange existence of limited dialogue with no fixed continuity in the animation of these characters.In having Bruno manoeuvre his way around the film in a more relaxed manner, using his joints more freely compared to everyone else, we note his behaviour and the manner of his actions in comparison to the limited others whom almost always resemble human-beings but don't act and react like human-beings in their robotic characteristics. Likewise, Bruno's attitudes as to what's around him on certain occasions makes him seem more aware of everything as the human characters idly and robotically proceed, with Bruno's reaction to most things in the film echoing our own. Focusing on his dreams as everyone else sleeps aids in humanising him further. The annual Tour de France bicycle race is the scene for the film to kick into another gear, the taking of Champion and the consequent setting out of rescuing the boy; a quest signified in both its inception and the immense magnitude of the task by a stunning sequence-come-shot of a huge boat sailing off into the horizon followed by a pedalo dwelling character trying to circumnavigate the large waves and tail it. The film's chief elements and attitudes in regards to its realism and the sheer sense of its content are systematically addressed in the house-rules for the purchasing of a pedalo acting as great comedy followed by this immense sequence of border-line Gothic horror as waves sweep and thunder crashes with the fact the pedalo can keep up with the liner at all.Everyone arrives in the city of Belleville, a strange hybridisation of contemporary New York City with 1950s Paris in which almost everyone is overweight. This place is corrupt and smutty, going a long way in destroying the earlier myth of it being an exciting and off-the-wall locale in which strange and magical things happened and success was around most corners. The film is a masterclass in animation, even the little things such as the anti-American slants arriving in good humour without being overly offensive, especially, I read, that of the targeting of Disney - no doubt reactionary in the providing of the supporting protagonists of 1989's The Little Mermaid with a specifically French chef, or even the miscalculated Americanisation of the chief Arabic characters in 1992's Aladdin. Finding Nemo is what you might watch with your kids, but when they're out of your life for a short time, Belleville Rendez-Vous is the one you watch for yourself."
101,The Triplets of Belleville,10,13 June 2010,Brilliant animation style and storytelling,"""The Triplets of Bellevue"", 2003, is well worth a watch by any animation or film buff. Nominated for two Academy Awards, including Best Animated Feature, it was an official selection at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was very well received.This film definitely has a style all it's own, not Japanese anime or Disney style animation. I'd describe it as, a highly stylized French style. Highly original and imaginative, it's easily one of the best animated films I've ever seen. Except for some computer enhanced action scenes, the animation is done the good, old fashioned way: hand drawn and hand painted.The simple story concerns the kidnapping of a Tour De France cyclist and the pursuit by his mother and family dog to rescue him. The animation is highly stylized, with character features exaggerated. All the main characters are well written and developed, with genuine personalities and back stories. Sometimes weird and dark, the film is always a visual and storytelling treat from beginning to end."
102,The Triplets of Belleville,9,27 April 2010,Unique and delightful- a French jewel of animation,"The Triplets of Belleville(or Belleville Rendez-vous as it is called in the UK) is something that is unique and delightful. It is ambitious most certainly, and the plot does have the occasional longueur, but I couldn't have be spellbound by the beautiful, unique visual animation style and the sensual title song ""Belleville Rendez-vous"". Asides from the animation and the music, it has some effortless slapstick(more visual than in the dialogue) and it is quirky and nostalgic, and it is this that gives the film its charm almost on its own. And of course I liked the characters, the grandson who is kidnapped from the Tour De France, the sinister gangsters, the club-footed but kindly grandmother and the pudgy but somewhat adorable dog. The set pieces involved here are splendid, highlights being the newsreel opening, the ocean crossing, the dinner with the Belleville triplets and the climatic chase. Overall, unique and delightful, definitely recommended. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
103,The Triplets of Belleville,10,12 December 2009,Eminence!,"OK, the first time I saw this movie was at one of our national TV-s called ""Cinemania"" which provides us with quite an entertainment. But I just couldn't trust my eyes on what I was able to see... Something with twisted narrative, implicit, kinda weird... I have never seen anything like it! First couple of times I wasn't able to watch it from the only beginning, but I managed to get the movie at last and see it ""full-scale"". It is an animated movie that left a huge and burning impression on me, giving me some new reasons to consider an animated movie ""more artistic"" than the generic movie. Such an imagination, such power of human mind manipulativeness... Perfect! I guess the French have that incredible narrative abilities. Is it because the lack of it in the bare beginning of the film itself? Lumier? (even if there was no narrative) Melies? :D I recommend it to absolutely everyone! Thank you!"
104,The Triplets of Belleville,10,10 June 2009,Animation: A Universal Language,"There are few things more satisfying than watching a film that totally blows your mind. The Triplets of Belleville has done that to me. At first, I noticed that the film had no subtitles. For a foreign movie to have no subtitles, the first thought is that something it wrong. But then I realized there were no subtitles because nobody talks, or at least nothing of importance. I was completely and utterly satisfied with this film. The animation is original and looks spectacular. The story is bizarre and outlandish, but it keeps you locked in. I think having nobody talk makes you pay more attention because every action or detail on screen is of vital importance to the story. Had Finding Nemo not come out that same year this would have own the Oscar for Animated Feature Film, no doubt. Bravo!"
105,The Triplets of Belleville,10,28 April 2009,French jewel in the rough,"This animated film is truly a piece of minimalistic art.Darkly funny, original, bizarre, moving and satirical, it tells the story of a selfless grandmother and her obese dog to free her 'champion' grandson from the clutches of the Mafia. Through very minimal use of dialogue (mostly in television and radio commentaries)and a plot that is more concerned with characters' interactions with their environment than with complicated stories and adventures, this film still manages to slide like a hyperdermic needle right under the skin of society in two very different countries - namely France and the USA. The animation in itself is unique, resembling especially harsh political caricatures more than anything else. The humour is mostly delivered visually, and will appeal to lovers of dark, satirical comedy. There are few crude jokes or slapstick here - this is one of those rare comedies that treats the audience as thinking beings. Also, this film will certainly offend some viewers through its harsh stereotyping and shameless exposure of the problems of society. But in an eye-opening way, nonetheless.However, amidst the humour there is a prevailing sense of the repetitiveness of life; of giving up hope for a better place. From the dog that barks at every train to the simulated biking course to the identical Mafia agents, the atmosphere is that of lives going about in circles, never reaching any kind of destination. And the drab browns and greys of the cityscapes make them seem like some dreary, ongoing dream. But through this darkness glimmer rays of hope and resourcefulness: the ability to eek out a meaningful life under these circumstances.All in all, do yourself a favour - ignore the negative criticism (most of it caused by the lack of a complicated plot - but the film more than makes up for this in other aspects), and give this unique film a chance."
106,The Triplets of Belleville,10,15 March 2009,Excellent Film,"The Triplets of Belleville is more than a film, it is an experience that tests the senses and stretches the mind. It encourages the viewer to imagine a world not seen in reality. A film created with true genius and a passion for the surreal. The soundtrack features a unique blend that mixes sounds from multiple decades and cultures to create an audio experience unlike any other. The characters featured in the film reflect real-life experiences and people with a surrealist twist. Overall a true gem in international film. I give it two thumbs up. Hands down, everyone should see this film. A real-life viewer, Michael G stated after seeing this film, ""I have a new respect for the surreal that I never had before, I see the world differently now. I see the potential each thing in our world has in its surreal form."" he also found the soundtrack very entertaining. The lack of dialogue in the film makes unique. The animation speaks for the characters and brings new life to our world. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested and willing to experience something new and truly remarkable."
107,The Triplets of Belleville,9,18 March 2008,Quotes,"I think the quotes in this IMDb entry are not only the most famous quotes but are the only dialog in the movie.Madame Souza: Is that it, then? Is it over, do you think? What have you got to say to Grandma? The Triplets of Belleville: Swinging Belleville rendevouz Marathon dancing, doop-de-doo Voodoo,can-can, balais, taboo in Belleville swinging rendevouz. Madame Souza: Is that it, then? Is it over, do you think? What have you got to say to Grandma? Champion: I think that's probably it. It's over, Grandma.The above are the quotes. I have to keep typing until I reach 10 lines. Otherwise it will not let me submit this."
108,The Triplets of Belleville,,25 February 2008,"oui, c'est Frog-lickin' bon","This unusual French animation seems to divide its audience right down the middle, and it is easy to understand why some people may not be impressed with what its creators have attempted to do. Its quirky style is strangely detached, leaving the viewer with no real sympathy for the main characters because of their lack of emotion. And yet, while I strongly felt this unappealing side to the film it still fascinated me and I felt compelled to see it through to the end just to see what bizarre developments were to come.People marvel at how realistic computer-generated animation films are these days, but this striving for realism usually leaves no room for charm, which is something this film does possess  even if it is a little on the quirky side. The characters are all caricatures, some humorous, others strangely haunting (the cyclist is the most doleful character I have ever seen in a film) and others, such as Grandma's faithful pooch, are simply there for comic effect, but it's always an absorbing mix  and any film which exercises both the writer's and the audiences imagination has to be worthy of praise."
109,The Triplets of Belleville,8,25 April 2007,"Toe-Tapping Triplets, but maybe a touch too trippy","Those Belleville Triplets are soooo cool. The part of the story you expect to be the main event from the start ends up playing second fiddle to the rest of the story, and I still have that title tune in my head a day after watching it and suspect I will for a while yet.The only reason I didn't rate this higher than 8 was due to the build-up to the end jumping into a universe with less rigid physical laws than the rest of the movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not stupidly inconsistent and I'm not someone who needs their movies to obey all the natural laws - god, Tom and Jerry cartoons wouldn't be much fun if I did, but the ""that wouldn't happen quite so easily"" thought did pop up and interrupt my enjoyment for a fraction of a second every now and then towards the end. The laws of the world they were in appeared to be stretched a bit rather than broken completely.Don't let my misgivings stop you looking out for it though, I really enjoyed this movie and after renting it would almost consider buying it. It has lots of very memorable moments, and even if you're not a fan of foreign subtitled movies I wouldn't worry so much as there isn't that much talking going on to hear anyway, it's all there on screen in their faces and actions for you to read anyway."
110,The Triplets of Belleville,9,6 March 2007,Another French Innovation after Minimal Invasive Surgery .,"This film is remarkable for its innovation and uniqueness in presentation and its wonderful music.With so many successful examples of animated films from Japanese ,Hollywood and Disney, Tripletes can still stood out and impressed viewers to wonder what else can still be created out of the imaginative world of cartoons and animation.The film is funny, sensational and imaginative. The hero of the story, the Grandma, did all possible and impossible tasks for the interest of her grandson, as all grandmas will do in the real world.There's only one flaw which I don't like in this film: using Bruno as the car tyre, which is not too humane.The French are a strange and innovative race. They've invented the world's fastest plane, minimal invasive surgery. Now they have started a new trend in animation.Well done!"
111,The Triplets of Belleville,10,31 July 2006,Incredible! A genuinely original animated feature,"This is a feature which can be watched once, and twice, and then again.Every time one views this gem, one sees something more.To a certain extent, it's a silent movie. It is also: a radical statement/exploration of what it is to be French; a study about obsession; an indication of just what it means to be human; and, given the characters, exactly how one copes with adversity and ageing.The triplets are not necessarily the centre of the action. However, they certainly represent the notion of women ageing disgracefully.And there's the rub. All the men, except the riders, the entrants in the Tour de France, are either obese (everyone within the city) or threatening figures. It's the WOMEN who are the attractive figures: not because of their gender, but because of their humanity. Frogs will never be the same.Bruno. What can one say about a CGI dog? Well... Bruno is exceptional and a REAL dog!!! Everything Bruno is seen to do, is exactly what a real pooch would do.The settings/backgrounds are the most intimate, stylish and interesting I think that I've ever seen encapsulated within an 'animated' feature.Loved it and loved it some more. 10/10"
112,The Triplets of Belleville,9,29 July 2006,gorgeous,"This film has so much going for it - the shapes are wonderfully exaggerated but convey such a real depiction of each character with the sharpest of observation, for example the gaunt muscularness of Champion and the barrel like stomach of Bruno. Yet Sylvain Chomet makes these features, which some might find repellent, really endearing and as a result all the details are strewn together to create a really vivid portrayal of people. I really liked the fact that the good people are just as unattractive as the bad people in their appearance but it is their actions that define them and not their appearances. You accept the characters with far more warmth because they are human as well and not a one dimensional paragon, which we are so used to nowadays when we watch an animation. The fact that there was minimal dialogue also made the animation more vivid and powerful in conveying these ideas. The subtlety blew my mind and I am defos buying it."
113,The Triplets of Belleville,10,15 May 2006,simply yet indescribably twisted yet brilliant,"As Chomet himself mentions in the featurette on the DVD, when someone tells a story using the medium of animation they can twist and exaggerate reality to a fairly limitless degree. His dedication to doing just that is both evident and grand. It may well be the single most beautiful animated feature i have seen. It's certainly the most unique. Rich with European caricature and intensely downbeat, the Triplets of Belleville the sort of story that rides the edge of depressing boredom but is too deeply moving and downright charming to ever make me think of stopping watching. In fact, when i first saw it I watched it twice in a row. The captivating emotion and very real physical intensity encases an altogether very odd little tale which itself incorporates some truly flabbergasting concepts. And wherever reality is twisted, exaggerated, or simply ignored, it is a glorious celebration of the universe that is animated cinema. You'll notice I haven't said anything at all about the actual story, or any of it's wealth of intriguing characters. And don't get me started on the music! Just watch it."
114,The Triplets of Belleville,7,3 March 2006,Visually Audacious Animation Provides Nice Twist to an Odd Rescue Tale,"Visual invention is certainly abundant in writer-director Sylvain Chomet's bizarre tale involving the kidnapping of Champion, a Tour de France cyclist by some square-shouldered gangsters and the ensuing rescue by his clubfooted grandmother, Madame Souza, and their overstuffed dog, Bruno. What makes this 2003 film the most audacious of animated features is a fervent style that goes directly against the current CGI trend by using traditional hand drawings with a minimum of computer work. Whereas sleek CGI films like ""Shrek"" and ""The Incredibles"" go for realism in almost an extreme fashion, Chomet goes in the opposite direction creating a sophisticated, surrealistic world with plenty of idiosyncratic detail. His visual style reminds me of the work of cartoonist Charles Bragg who exaggerates facial features but maintains a relatable humanism to his characters, and there are also traces of Mad magazine's expert caricature work and the old WWII-era Warner Brothers cartoons.The story is mainly dialogue-free (except for some incidental asides and music), and consequently, the images carry the plot line. It opens with an intentionally scratchy, black-and-white musical number meant to show the triplets of the title in their prime thirty years prior with period-authentic performances by Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt, banana-festooned Josephine Baker and shoe-attacked Fred Astaire. From there, the film moves to the main characters, the kidnapping and the eventual Atlantic crossing to Belleville, an elaborate city that looks like it was built like the Tower of Babel. There, Madame Souza and Bruno meet the triplets, now old hags who live in a cockroach-infested tenement and eat half-dead frogs for all three meals. They all get involved in finding the gangsters and rescuing Champion. It's all done with impressive technique, although the pacing sometimes lags, especially at the beginning when the mood is being established. The other problem is that Champion is not developed as a character, and consequently, his rescue lacks a certain emotional catharsis for the viewer.Regardless, most of the images are stunning, in particular, the nook-and-cranny detail of Belleville (apparently a conglomeration of New York, Paris and Montreal), the Tour cycling sequence over the mountains and the breathtaking ocean crossing scene. The finale has a surprisingly violent element for a cartoon, but it doesn't distract from the fanciful nature of the tale. There is an informative 15-minute, making-of featurette which explains the creative process in cursory detail, as well as another short that shows Chomet explaining his drawing technique. Three scenes allow the creators to explain their genesis with commentary in French with English subtitles. A video of the catchy ""Belleville Rendez-Vous"" is also included. While not really a family film, this is an animated treat for those tiring of the more commercial Pixar and Dreamworks product."
115,The Triplets of Belleville,10,12 February 2006,Magical,"I watched this film only because a friend in the next village lent it to me and said it was good. I would never have picked it up by choice looking at the synopsis on the back of the jacket. But what a mistake that could have been had I never seen it! As has already been said, it puts Disney to shame, not just for its artistic and technical excellence, which by itself is a redoubtable feat. But this film just oozes atmosphere. You're not a spectator, you become an unwitting participant in the drama. It really is a terrific film. You need to know NO French at all to follow it and it is truly a film for all ages in spite of the naked boobies in the first few minutes! The soundtrack ""Les Triplettes de Belleville"" is very, very catchy! I will watch this film again and again. Go and watch it yourself and be captivated as I was - you'll be glad you did!"
116,The Triplets of Belleville,8,21 January 2006,Entrancing,"I originally decided to watch this film after seeing the song nomination at the Oscar awards. I was fascinated by the beating of bicycles and random furniture during the performance and couldn't imagine how it could have gotten nominated (although the song was catchy).But from the moment I started watching,I was transfixed. Hardly a word spoken in the movie, but compelling action and characters throughout. The dog was absolutely precious.There are truly few animated features that I would recommend to adults, but this is one of them! Bravo!"
117,The Triplets of Belleville,,9 January 2006,Beautiful,"Fascinating beautiful animated film that really shows what animation is capable of; creating worlds and people unlike any seen in the real world, and then give them life. Practically no dialogue is uttered, but the wonderful character animation does that it's never missed. Fantastic design work (weird bending people made of lines with swung in them that makes the Genie seem all conservative, and equally funny and weird angular people), great use of sounds and music, and a constantly surprising, touching and hilarious story (which resembled Spirited Away in it's dreamy progression and sudden jumps)... can't think of anything bad to say? They even integrated CGI and hand drawn animation beautifully."
118,The Triplets of Belleville,8,24 December 2005,Refreshingly original!,"This movie is unusual and refreshingly original. It shows that animated movies can really be a form of art and a great medium to tell a story with. The movie is highly unusual in terms of style and story. The movie has a refreshing and original own visual style and a story that is quite ridicules but at the same time charming and intriguing.The character animation and the animation in general are magnificent and truly original. All of the character have an unique and odd over-the-top and stereotypical look. The characters are really what makes this movie so much fun to watch. The look of the movie is very refreshing and are totally different from any other animated movie.Especially to those who don't like or are accustomed to reading subtitles, don't let the French language scare you of. The movie doesn't have any spoken lines and in theory you can watch this movie with the sound of (although you won't be able then to hear those catchy great tunes). The movie its visuals really tell the story on its own and it makes the unusual and odd story a treat to follow, also thanks to the charming suiting music and songs.But the story really isn't the most important element of the movie. It really are the visuals and characters that make this movie an unique viewing experience with some unforgettable characters and moments in it.I really enjoyed this movie and I'm truly looking forward to new Sylvain Chomet animated projects.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
119,The Triplets of Belleville,9,5 December 2005,Animated Relaxation on a Stick,"Whilst the paper-thin plot may annoy some viewers, the crunchy amphibians may revolt others (you'll see..), this film shines in its simplicity. It doesn't TRY to be deep (there may be hidden meanings wrapped around umpteen parts of the film, there may not, frankly I'm always too busy enjoying it to care), it just entertains and strips away the office-induced headaches and stress.It's good to know that there's something heart-warming, attention-grabbing and homely in a film, yet it demands so little from you. You just fire it up, lay back and melt into the couch.Other aspects of the film have been probed to death by scores of other reviewers. So, I'll leave it at this: try it if you want something different, it really doesn't demand you think differently, just be in the mood to relax. Don't take preconceptions of the film being this or that, just sit and watch it, empty your head."
120,The Triplets of Belleville,9,9 November 2005,The best french film ever.,"The title says it all. Despite being a homage to silent films with the only sound being a truly cinematic soundtrack, the animation is full of character and should be a remainder to Disney Corp. how to create real movies with charm, rather then empty 3-D shells. The film follows the heroic quest of Madame Souza and her quest with dog, Bruno, to find missing a cyclist before the Tour De France. As a result she heads for Belleville. The intricate animation of handrawn pictures is magnificent and the caricatures of people are greatly exaggerated to humorous effect, this universe created to fantastic and blows apart anything Disney and Pixar have ever dream ed of creating."
121,The Triplets of Belleville,10,6 November 2005,"Beautifully Rendered, Told, Whimsical Off-Beat Story","With the predictably sunny approach to what goes today for most feature animation, thank god for Miyazaki (Spirited Away) and the director of this extraordinary piece of animation. This feature is not aimed specifically at kids nor does it talk down to anyone. This is a beautifully rendered film using traditional cel animation as well as digital 2-D and 3-D animation. The main characters are detailed, layered and wonderful, including the marvelous characterization of Bruno, the dog. No, Bruno is not an anthropomorphic talking dog, it is a real dog with a real dog personality and quirks.This feature constantly caught me off-guard, surprising me with its wonderfully quirky characterizations as well as imagery. If you are fan of animation, this feature is a must. If you are not one for most animation, you might want to give this sophisticated piece of animation a try. The main song is extremely toe-tapping and is a hoot.I don't think I can recommend this one more highly."
122,The Triplets of Belleville,9,1 November 2005,One of my favorite 2D animated movies,"This movie has some of the most creative and unique character concepts I have ever seen in a 2D animated movie. I remember the first time I saw it I was in my 2D animation class and the teacher popped it in for us to watch if we wanted and I said ""nah, I'm running behind"" but I did look up to see what it's style was and was amazed at the unique character designs. From the blocky mobsters to the snooty waiter who literally bends backwards, this movie was all together original (especially compared to the modern anime look which is taking over everything giving little room for creative freedom). The backgrounds (some painted and some 3D like the characters) are also breath taking. As for the story, I enjoyed that as well. I love to see writers and animators take the challenge of a silent film, however it is slow, but I myself like slow movies in my collection for times I feel a little more mellow. I do however understand many people do not like slow movies and want to be on the edge of their seat the entire time, so if you are this kind of person I would say this movie may not be for you. Once again I would like to state I think the art alone makes this film a 9 out of 10, and I hope to see more originality out of 2D animated movies!"
123,The Triplets of Belleville,9,7 September 2005,Not Like the Others,"Wonderfully weird and endearing, this unabashed adventure hits all the marks. It's visually captivating like few other animated films and manages to tell a tidy tale without the aid of dialogue (for the most part). In my experience with the film , young children (age 6 or so) will have a hard time getting over the fact that the characters don't talk. Older kids (9 and up) will love the action and unique drawings.The film's texture reminded me of Dick Tracy minus the supercharged colors. In an era when animated films are almost always surefire box-office hits despite a lack of ingenuity, Triplets of Belleville dared to be different and it's paid off with a handsome and captivating piece of art. My kids never suggested seeing this in the theater but loved it when we rented it."
124,The Triplets of Belleville,8,7 December 2004,Different versions?,"I've just seen the movie in Cape Town about 3 months after seeing it on French TV. I am almost sure the version on the TV was longer and had a sequence of scenes while the son/grandson was growing up and training to be a cyclist. Does anyone know if there is more than one version?I loved the movie, particularly for the beautiful renderings and comically exaggerated drawings. My only gripes were the pace of the movie, which seemed uniform and the cyclists were too one-dimensional. The best scene has to be the triplets and grandmother making music with household objects in the nightclub...or perhaps the ocean crossing on the pedal boat."
125,The Triplets of Belleville,8,15 October 2004,surrealistic piece of art,This movie is just beautiful blend of so many things I can hardly count them all. Let's try:It has classic animation and it has 3D animation. It has scenic music and it has classic music. It has comedy. It has parody and it has political satire. It has drama and adventure. It has action and violence. It has melancholy. It has musical and crime. It has well-portrayed characters and it has even a plot. Every single thing in it is exaggerated to no end. It's original and it has whole lot of gimmicks for those keen-eyed.If I was to criticize something then it would be one or two somewhat outdated gags and not so lasting impression. But in overall I recommend it to anyone ready for some witty humor.8/10
126,The Triplets of Belleville,7,28 September 2004,"Entertaining, but not much more than that","'Les Triplettes de Belleville' is a simple exercise in style, notable especially for its expressive use of sound and its grotesque (even repulsive) design. Given that there's almost no dialogue, it's surprising how well Sylvain Chomet keeps our interest. He mainly does this by creating two lovingly detailed characterizations--the serious, doting, and (we suspect) under-appreciated grandma, Madame Souza, and the wonderful dog Bruno, one of the most believable movie canines in recent memory. Beyond that, there's not much to this film--it ultimately reminds us of the dark toybox films of Jean-Pierre Jeunet; like them, it's very pretty and consistently entertaining, but we sometimes wish it had something more than visual ideas in its head. 7 out of 10."
127,The Triplets of Belleville,,17 September 2004,Triplets - Aeon Flux Link?,"There seems to be a lot of commonality between the animation style in this movie and in the old MTV show Aeon Flux. This seems to be most evident in looking at the lines of some of the animated characters - especially the triplets, the bicyclists, the waiters in the restaurant scene, and the frogs. They are kind of over-elongated and spindly, much like most of the animated figures in Aeon Flux. Also, there is very little dialogue in both.Looking at the credits of both, Triplets and Aeon Flux though, I couldn't find any credits in animation or production in common. Perhaps the animators came from the same school of training or something, but I have no idea how to research that. Does anyone know if there is any link between the two?"
128,The Triplets of Belleville,,15 September 2004,interesting political commentary,"I have read through all of the comments, however, am I the only one that saw the different levels of psychology going on in this film. It draws not only on Fleisher and other animation pioneers, but on Freud, and Jung as well. 3 different levels of dreamscape are detected. The bicycle race with Lance Armstrong winning, the stereotyped NYC belleville, with ""hambougouis"" served on every corner including in the raised arm of a bloated miss liberty.... no money no hambougouis! The bicycle machine is a commentary on the media machine. The three racheted racers are the steppers on a varactor. Those old enough remember when there were only 3 TV channels... the comment is that the mob runs the movie business, and that the mouseman who oils the gears under the bicycle movie machine... the driver of this cinema machine is a charature of Walt Disney himself.... look again! This movie has more levels than Le Eiffel Tower!"
129,The Triplets of Belleville,,4 August 2004,Good fun,"It's very rare that an animated feature length movie not from Disney or Hollywood makes it to a cinema here and this slightly underground, rather idiosyncratic one is a treat, particularly if you like something quirky. The settings reflect where the production companies were based, very French and French-Canadian (although there are scenes in Belleville obviously based on New York).  There's lots of humour and little send-ups, the French of themselves and North Americans.  I loved the ""Voiture Balais"" or sweeping vehicle (a 1947 Citroen van) in the Tour de France and the stretched version of the Citroen 2cv cars that the mafia in Belleville get around in."
130,The Triplets of Belleville,7,3 August 2004,"Imaginative, original and fun little movie","Belleville Rendez-Vous sticks out from most other films mostly because of it's complete lack of dialogue (save a couple of songs/announcements). This is very admirable of the movie, because despite this; it is still able to tell a story, and tell a story well. And that is an admirable quality when your film has no verbal communication in it. However, because of this the film does limit itself to what it can do with the story, as verbal communication is obviously a big part of most films; this is epitomised by one point in the movie when the film can't portray 'no', without the character saying ""no"".I don't really like animation to be honest, but every now and again, a film from a genre/style that I don't really like comes out, and I like it. This is one of those films. Animation is well known for being a children's medium of film, and this isn't unwarranted as many children's films are animated pictures. This film, however, I would say is not suitable for children, or at least not young children. The film features more than a few rather shocking images, for animation; such as a cold blooded killing, a topless dancer and a prostitute...in action. Things like this are what sets Belleville Rendez-Vous apart from kid's animated features. And in my opinion, it's to this movie's credit.The plot of the film, like a lot of animated movies, is secondary to it's absurd visuals, but regardless; it follows the story of a grandmother and her fat dog who team up with a trio of female singers to rescue her son; a skinny, big nosed, tour de France participant that is kidnapped by the mafia. The film plays out like an adventure themed acid trip, as along the way our heroines encounter no end of imaginative and colourful characters and scenarios. The plot is very simply played, which is mostly due to the fact that the only it can further itself is through visuals, due to the lack of verbal communication.Overall, Belleville Rendez-Vous is an imaginative, inventive and original piece of art; what it lacks in fine plot details and character depth, it makes up for with great imagery and an abundant sense of fun. I therefore recommend this film to anyone, that wants to see something a little different."
131,The Triplets of Belleville,10,25 July 2004,C'est Magnifique! (minor spoilers),"'Les Triplettes de Belleville' is one of the best movies I've seen all year, and one of the greatest animation films I've seen ever! So surreal, so sarcastic, it's a great time.Those familiar with the work of Ralph Bakshi, director of animated films like 'American Pop,' 'Hey Good Lookin,' and 'Heavy Traffic,' won't find the animated style (or story) to be quite so weird and surrealistic as a good Bakshi film ('American Pop' being Bakshi's best). Although, Bakshi's films, as far as story quality, are much darker, and often dramatic while Les Triplettes of Bellville is obviously a light-hearted comedy.The movie centers around the Tour de France. Our main character is pretty much Madame Souza, grandmother of a bicycle champion. She's a lovable little character, an incredibly short, stout woman with orthopedic shoes and a lazy eye. It's quite comical to watch her ride on a tricycle around town blowing her whistle as she trains her grandson for the race. He, who is not at all an appealing character to look at, with his large nose and face like a sullen animal, a waste like Aeon Flux, and huge leg muscles. He never speaks, and rarely expresses emotion. A to the mix, a fat female dog (I thought it was a pregnant dog the way it was always fretting) with little chicken legs named Bruno, who shares in the adventures. (I love their little three story house, with the train track built as close to it as possible just short of knocking the damn structure over).While at the Tour de France, Madam Souza and another guy's car is sabotaged by some suits in the French mafia. These are two of the most bizarre characters I've ever seen, with large boxy suits of matte black. When they stand next to each other, they look like Siamese twins, and they tend to blend in a lot. They're headed by a short fat guy with a large know looks like a French Super Mario. They kidnap some of the racers who straggled behind, and absconded to Bellville, where they intend to use them for sport--stationary bike racing, which I suppose is a more sophisticated alternative to the poor European working-class's cock fighting (just say no!) and bare knuckle boxing. Madam Souza and Bruno the trusty hound have only minimal clues of the whereabouts of her grandson, only knowing that he is somewhere in Belleville. And that's where our lovely Tripplettes enter the picture. Classic French burlesque singers they were in the past, but now the three aging singers live in an old apartment building somewhere in the slums (though they don't make it very 'slumming' on the inside) on the outskirts of Bellville. They befriend little Madam Souza and Bruno, and eventually, help her in her adventure to save her grandson from the grips of the French mob. I absolutely love the chase scene at the end because it seems like they used the most comical way to stop their mobster adversaries from catching up to them. It was fantastic!I absolutely recommend 'Les Triplettes de Belleville.' If you're of an American audience like me, you'll probably be grateful for something so fresh and new to come around within recent years (Hollywood produces an awful lot of trash and sometimes, independent makers do too). I love the music (those Triplettes can practically play downbeat and they can make an instrument with nearly anything they've got), the weird animation (look at the French waiter for example, or the little rat-faced henchmen, and the stupid boyscout), and the great times that Madam Souza, Bruno, and the Triplettes share. It's a great movie all around. And the perfect part is that there is no real dialogue to screw any of that up.If you watch the DVD version, which is beautiful, you get the option of the Belleville Rendez-vous music video, which is incredibly strange, but nonetheless, has quite an interesting technique that pays homage to silent era black and white movies. It's so goofy! So have yourself a rendez-vous with Madam Souza, Bruno, and the Triplettes of Belleville!"
132,The Triplets of Belleville,,17 July 2004,Ingenious,"Minds of few ingenious men converge to produce a work of utmost quality. ""The Triplets of Belleville"" is without doubt one of the most creative animated features to date. It is both weird and realistic. Weird for it's unique, surrealistic characters. You have plenty of them to choose from: gangsters with rectangular shoulders, obese inhabitants of Belleville, with an awkwardly walking French waiter apparently stealing the show. Realistic for it's genuinely portrayed relationship between grandma and her grandson (to say nothing of the dog). Characters that you instantly sympathize with. The plain story is accompanied by strikingly original music; However,  the simplicity of the plot is misleading. If you are not attentive enough some details might go unnoticed. In spite of the fact that some of those details are quite subordinate to the plot they are a worthy gift to an attentive viewer. Things are not spelled out and as a matter of fact the movie is dialogue free what makes it universal destroying the annoying barriers of dubbing. In essence, why use words when facial expressions deliver messages that no words could possibly convey. The animated feature may not be exactly suitable for children and exaggerated caricatures might be offensive to some but the only scene that falls short to the rest, in my humble opinion, is somewhat extended car chase scene which nevertheless does not at all spoil the overall delightful impression of an inimitable masterpiece."
133,The Triplets of Belleville,,12 July 2004,When Disney meets Tati,"A must.78 minutes of Paradise.For a movie nut,like me,it's a quiz about cinema.You have 3 Cruellas inside,mostly naughty and crazy and a lot of Jacques Tati.If this was not enough it's also a delicious irony about his own french identity-the big red nose of the wine drinkers,or the compulsive-like frog-eating-and about the American junk food-everyone in Belleville is so fat. A little bit about Tati.Champion is Francois from ""Jour de Fete"",you can see a poster of ""Les vacances de monsieur Hulot"" on the wall and also,the dumb or hum like speech is hundred percent tatiesque.Chomet seems to speak in an easy going fluid way this kind of language,and that's why this film is a glorious moment of cinema.If I have to choose one minute from this movie,I would choose the trip on the see with Mozart's Kyrie as a soundtrack."
134,The Triplets of Belleville,9,17 June 2004,Souza's love for Champion,"I enjoy this movie for all the reasons others have offered here. The beautiful rolling sea, the music, Bruno in all his dogness, the detail of Paris growing up around their home, the witty play on Euro and French Canadian and U.S. culture. What I admired most was the completely believable portrayal of Souza's love for Champion. I am struck that this is a movie about love. The concern the animators achieve in Souza's expressive cartoon eyes and face is a miracle. We see her trying and trying to make him happy as a child, through the piano, and then through Bruno. We see her satisfied delight at his delight in his new tricycle. When he is grown, she, elderly, hobbling, and without money, devises ways to help him train using what she has around the house. The loving look on her face after he's fallen asleep on his bike after dinner. Her kiss goodnight when she tucks him in. To see her cross the sea, navigate the unfamiliar city, stare down speeding cars, eat river frog soup--she does it with a kind of adorable grandmotherly aplomb that comes from doting on her only grandchild and having no choice but to do what she has to do to help him. One of the great grandmother characters in all moviedom."
135,The Triplets of Belleville,,8 June 2004,OMG,"This movie was the best yet the music made it so words weren't needed and the characters were so unique (sept. for the dog he reminded me of my own) they did such a wonderful job. i immediately went out and got 300 people that i know to sit down and watch it in an amphitheater with me. most results were good the rest were great never have i seen a better movie. the first time i watched it i was confused for i didn't understand what was going on. but then i watched it again and i notice things i hadn't before. the tilted room, the rat and horse noises, and all the very little details that are hidden within the movie. i loved it so much i want to say I WANT TO BE TWISTED LIKE THE TRIPLETS FROM BELLVILLE!!!!!"
136,The Triplets of Belleville,,18 May 2004,"Funny and wonderfully, playfully weird-Son Fantastique!","The animation in ""Triplettes"" is clearly the work of brilliant consortium. The drawn art work layers smoothly and adds to the visual spectacle with strong images while not jolting the audience.The story is simple but the characters are surreal. The tone a is mixture of the best dry continental tongue in cheek humor, slapstick gags and visual absurdity.We see the resolve of a grandmother (who must be near a hundred years old) to free her kidnapped grandson. The dreams of a dog fixated on trains are revealed to us and well as the memories of the retired scat singing Triplettes. Frogs are blown into the air as well as the gangsters who seem to come most commonly in snap-together sets of three.I mentioned that the story-line is simple; indeed it is so simple to follow that subtitles are not needed. The action flows in clear visual strings of information that a few words of French here and there need no translation.The above being said, WHY did Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment think it fit to issue the DVD with out even the option of watching this great film in its original form? You can watch the DVD in English or Spanish, nothing else!I am insulted and angry by this travesty. If they really believe that the American movie watching public is such a bunch of Ya-Hoos they can't figure out how to set the language of a DVD then maybe they should get out of the US foreign film market.Specialize in monster-truck films or something but leave the fine work of movies like this, if not alone, then at least available as an option. The DVD was a disappointment and left a very bad taste in my mouth."
137,The Triplets of Belleville,,14 May 2004,Fantastic film - do not miss.,"This film is so smooth, well written and executed that it's amazing it didn't get wider release. The humor is at times extremely subtle and at others, very broad and even slapstick. The art is amazing - the use of CG is unobtrusive, the characters are beautifully and stylistically drawn, the sound is spot-on. The animation is far from ""clunky"" - it's quite deliberate and smooth - but it's not as vivid or vibrant as other animated pieces. The caricatures (non- principals) in particular are beautifully drawn and animated. That there's no dialog makes no difference; you love these characters almost immediately.  Will kids like it, being a ""cartoon""? Possibly, although it has a more mature target audience, IMHO - especially these days where everyone wants everything explained and pre-digested for them."
138,The Triplets of Belleville,,13 May 2004,A truly wonderful film,"I thought that this was a truly wonderful film, on many levels.The animation is outstanding, truly art (but not arty).The characterization is amusing and whimsical but with a light touch and yet with a depth that would put many of your average films to shame.The story too is very humorous and it kept my attention throughout.Yes it may be eccentric, but it is also an absolute joy to watch, full of finely honed wit  I recommend this film very highly."
139,The Triplets of Belleville,,3 May 2004,ONE OF THE KIND,"This one is really the one of the kind.I can't even describe the kind.But it sets a new style that words can't tell.It's a french movie but not in totally in European way.Although that's for sure that no one but an European can do this work.    It's hard to tell which character's story this is.There are a trio swing group,a grandmother,and a grandson,and also their dog.By examining each character you can see different points of view,new aspects of the movie.It's even true for the dog.The story is so simple but the beauty lies in details.Like the evolution of the train passing by the house or the thin bodies of the triples who eating frogs as everyone around is fat due to eating burgers.    The screenplay doesn't just put the situation in front of the the watcher as it is.It builds a background,tells how things started,shows where they happen.So we know where we are from and where we are going.And we easily accept the world things happening.Because doesn't try to judge it,just it as it is and leave the decision to us.Besides it's not that different from our world.But I think it doesn't really take any risk,I mean it just shows the sides it wants.We can't totally describe the whole place.But it gives the wave of atmosphere as we all know Bellivelle.    And there's something to be said about animations.The style is not that kind we're used to.And it really can put the audience off the movie.As the Japan animation and their style with sharp lines get the favor of most of us,it's a real bet to think this can work in most of Europe and U.S.A..And I should say that there's nearly no speech.But animations are so successful about telling the story that you can think that if there were words,they would be burdens.There isn't a clear and clean vision,and it has some kind of dark side.But after all these the total of the elements;story,details,music,make you think like that's the only way to do this one.That was what I mean when I said it's not in totally European way.Maybe not using a specific.well-known way but telling what it has in mind clearly;from story to details.    The music is really interesting.Because of the fact that the triples are swing singers,you may hope beautiful songs.But these are more than that.I can't definitely claim that the songs are awesome but they are really intersting.Lyrics,enstruments...nothimg familiar to MTV generation.I don't think the song that got a nomination for Oscars deserved it but it sure deserves some attention.    This animation movie has one thing in common with Japan animation style:It's not for kids.Maybe it seems sweet,funny but details like killing the frogs with dynamites... I don't think Chomet designed this for kids.Except children I don't think Bellivelle will hurt anyone in mind.Of course it seems as a strange way to make this kind of animation for big guys,but I bet it would be stranger if this was a real movie.     I can't suggest this movie to everyone.It dances in a thin line.There are a lot of fans of this movie out there.As a fan of American story-telling style.I only can say that I liked it.I'm not a fan,I can't even say that I may watch it again.But at least the attention to get into this movie will identify if you're a movie fan or just a watcher.I can't say this for every movie,especially for an European movie,but Belleville deserves it."
140,The Triplets of Belleville,,4 April 2004,Tres bien!,"Here's proof that there's more to cartooning than Disney.  Hey, I liked Finding Nemo, but there is simply no comparison.  The Triplettes of Belleville is one of the most creative, visually challenging, entertaining and funny movies I've seen in a long, long time.  The idiosyncratic detail of every character (especially the dog) is amazing and laugh out loud funny. Belleville the city is a miracle of the imagination.  I'll never look at another bicyclist in Central Park without hearing the tweet, tweet of grandma's whistle and the squeak, squeak of her tricycle wheels!  You can't go wrong -- there's even a chase scene!  Let's face it, the Oscar givers got it all wrong . . . again."
141,The Triplets of Belleville,8,12 March 2004,Agreeably weird,"When I was a kid watching cartoons, I always preferred the old Bugs Bunny, Popeye and Mickey Mouse shorts to anything made for TV.  This was partly because--until very recently--the quality of TV animation just didn't measure up to the stuff made for movie theaters.  But a bigger reason was that the older cartoons were so much more inventive, featuring all sorts of weird gadgets, whacked out booby traps, surreal sight gags, oddball music, and strange characters who were not always cute; and there was rarely a lesson to be learned at the end.  ""The Triplets of Belleville"" is a new movie that hearkens back to that kind of cartoon without slavishly aping the old style (remember the ""Roger Rabbit"" shorts that ran in front of Disney's live-action movies in the early '90's?).In the prologue, we are introduced to Madame Souza and her grandson, a tubby little boy named Champion.  When Champion gets a scrawny little puppy named Bruno for his birthday, he is disappointed.  Madame Souza is at a loss as to why until she is cleaning under his bed and finds a scrapbook devoted to the Tour de France.  So she gives him a tricycle, and the boy is overjoyed.The film fast-forwards several years.  Champion is now an absurdly skinny man with equally absurdly muscular legs.  Bruno is now fat and always barks at the Paris Metro train that runs past his window.  And we learn that Madame Souza has devised a very unorthodox training regimen for Champion that needs to bee seen to be believed, because he is about to compete in the Tour de France.  She is also working on figuring out how to use a bicycle wheel as a musical instrument, since she is so incompetent on the piano.During the tour itself, Champion and two other cyclists are kidnapped by a pair of square-shouldered thugs and put on a trans-Atlantic ship.  Madame Souza and Bruno are minutes too late to rescue Champion, so instead they follow the ship across the ocean (how they do it is a testament to the endurance and determination of 2-dimensional grandmothers and dogs) to the city of Belleville, which looks suspiciously like New York, only more baroque.Once Madame Souza lands in Belleville, she quickly finds herself lost and penniless.  Under a bridge in a run-down neighborhood, she plunks out a tune on a discarded bicycle wheel, which attracts the Triplets of Belleville, a singing trio popular back in the '30's (and one of Madame Souza's favorites) who have fallen on hard times.  The sisters take her in and eventually make her part of their musical show.As for Champion, we learn he was kidnapped because his skills as a cyclist will help power a machine that the French Mafia--I'm sorry, but I can't explain it simply.  Suffice it to say it's all very strange.In fact, this whole movie is very strange, which is why I liked it.  The humor owes much to Charlie Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" and to Terry Gilliam's work with Monty Python.  What little dialog there is rates so low as far as the story is concerned that the film's American distributors wisely chose not to translate it into English except for one line at the beginning and two lines at the end.A word of warning to parents.  This film is not for pre-school kids. There is a lot of gross-out humor, such as the Triplets' steady diet of frogs and a close-up of a hooker's unshorn armpit hair.  Also there is a caricature of Josephine Baker dancing topless.Although ""The Triplets of Belleville"" lacks the customary warmth one associates with animated films, it's combination of traditional cell animation, computer animation and live action make it a new benchmark by which future cartoons will be judged.  Maybe not as great as ""Snow White"" or ""Toy Story"", but a fitting companion to such unconventional cartoons as ""Yellow Submarine"" or ""The Phantom Tollbooth"".  8 out of 10."
142,The Triplets of Belleville,,25 February 2004,Perspective,"For those of us who like to see Arnold kill 5 people in the first 30 seconds of a movie, Triplets moves too slowly.  For those of us who don't need instant satisfaction, this is a beautiful and strange film.  Typically French in that you can't connect all the image streams to the plot, but that's what gives it the charm it has.  The distorted images and the score contribute to its grace, and one should just go with the flow and not question the significance of the imagery.  It truly is very subtle at points.  Something to see more than once, so you can appreciate the sight gags.  I still laugh out loud when I think of the dog barking at the trains."
143,The Triplets of Belleville,,21 February 2004,for something different,"okay, so it's not the most revolutionizing thing in the world. But that doesn't automatically qualify it as the biggest dissapointment ever because despite it's flaws, Triplet's overwhelmingly still an innovative movie, and entertaining when approached w/out overwhelming and outlandish expectations.But it's faaaaaaaaarrrrrrr different than it's fellow Oscar nominees.  I'm going to disregard Brother Bear for a moment (my apologies) and just compare the other two movies in the Oscar category of Best Animated Film. Both deserve to be nominated, both push the genre of animation, but in different ways.  While Finding Nemo discovered a new way to animate, Triplets definately pushed the envelope on how to use animation.  It is one of the few animated films to rely primarily on visuals.  Nemo is a verbally driven movie with a stunning backdrop, one that certainly deserves to be recognized.  But with Triplets, the visual IS the dialogue.  You learn more from one look, one gesture than the minimalist amount of dialogue.  The deadpan attitudes of Souza and Champion in the face of bizarre situations makes the characters that more effective, much more effective if they were to express their ambivilence verbally. Nor would the social satire be nearly as witty or effective if put into lines spoken by someone (e.g.-the visual of ""Hollyfood"" is much more effective than if someone said, ""Ya know, these guys eat so much, they might as well change it to 'hollyfood'"")It's the same thing when it comes to characterization.  Again, Nemo uses dialogue to enhance and define characterization while Triplets uses the visual.  Does that mean that many of the characters in Triplets are outlandish and cartoonish? Yes. But it's an animated feature, it IS allowed to be a suspension of reality (even now that the focus is on hyper-real digital animation).And yes, this isn't a movie that one can sit back, watch, and blank out from time to time, nor is it a family movie.  One has to pay attention and god forbid, think.  Which is okay every once in awhile, right? Yeah, it's not going to be one of the best, or most innovated films out there, but there are elements that are truly great and should be appreciated, as any change of pace is.And what's wrong with something different?"
144,The Triplets of Belleville,8,21 February 2004,Interesting; different; worthwhile,"""The Triplets of Belleville""Essentially, I agree with ""Bob the moo""'s review (on 30Dec03).The movie contains a number of minor little pearls which capture a bit of life in an absolutely charming way and I found the movie worth it for those. For example, Bruno (the family dog) was especially well-captured -- his dreams, his behaviors; also the groveling maitre d', etc.The movie (IMO) is somewhat in the Japanese animé style -- some backgrounds (e.g., the sea) are beautifully painted while the characters are in a more simplistic cartoon style. But it's animé with a very idiosyncratic, French flavor. Many people on the streets are Tweedle-dum/Tweedle-dee in shape (round) or gigantically obese. Ocean going ships which, in real life, would have a length 8X their height, in the movie are foreshortened so their heights are perhaps 1½X their lengths. The welded plates of their hulls, painted and rusting, are realistically rendered.Viewing it gave me the impression that, while Computer Animation (as in ""Nemo"") is good, it's not the ONLY valid approach to animation. Some impressions become stronger when made in the traditional animated approach. Artistically, movies need both.The storyline is not strong or logical but it does provide the string on which the pearls are strung.A grandmother is raising her grandson and we first see them when the boy is about five years old. A photo of a young man and woman, standing together beside their bicycles, is on the wall over his bed and we presume they're the boy's dead parents.Grandmother searches to find something to interest him and she finds bicycling is the way. She dedicates both of their lives to training him for bike racing. And it's while riding his bike that the boy then -- and as a young man -- seems serene and comfortable. The young man and two other bike racers are kidnapped by a Mafia, taken to a large city, and put in slavery biking in a rigged race on which other gangsters bet. Grandmother and Bruno follow them and are befriended by the elderly Triplettes who help them restore grandmother, grandson, and dog.What's the point of it? The emotional effect of the surrealistic artistic distortion and the capturing of the little truths and fantasies."
145,The Triplets of Belleville,8,21 February 2004,Just Splendid,"I finally got a look at this little animated gem, and I fell in love with it. The plot is very simple (but not stupid) and easy to follow (there is very little dialogue), the animation is quite unique, and the characters are great. The ending was rather ordinary, but it really doesn't take away from the film.                                                                       8/10. I also recommend the soundtrack."
146,The Triplets of Belleville,7,21 February 2004,Unlike Anything You've Ever Seen,"The first I time heard of ""The Triplets of Belleville,"" I heard that it would be ""Finding Nemo""'s only competition at the Oscars for Best Animated Feature Film.  Immediately, I was pumped.  Could another bizarre, excellent animated movie like ""Spirited Away"" win an Oscar?Yet ""The Triplets of Belleville,"" sadly, falls far from excellence.  First of all, this movie has very, very little dialogue.  However, I didn't mind that in itself.  What I feel should've made up for the silence is music. Movies without much dialogue need a very strong score, and although the bits of music played are well-composed, much more was needed to carry the movie. Also, I thought the story was weak, and merely an excuse for some creative animation.  Finally, the movie, I felt, did not flow well.  Some unnecessary parts of the movie are extremely slow, while others seem to go quickly that should have more time to fully develop.Nevertheless, this movie has its good aspects.  First, the animation is incredible, bizarre, and unique.  The ""caricature-esque"" people, places, and objects, make you uncomfortable in a weird sort of way, which, I believe, is a good thing for animation to do.  Plus, there's much time to concentrate on the animation with the lack of dialogue.  Also, I enjoyed the foreshadowing that takes place in the movie.  It's sort of hard to catch on to, but once you realize where it was, you see how brilliant the subliminal predictions are.  Finally, I enjoyed the director's strange sense of comedy.  While others may not find this movie funny at all, I found several moments caused me to laugh uncontrollably.In conclusion, if you like to see bizarre movies and enjoy some thinking outside the box, then you'll probably enjoy this movie.  However, it definitely has its flaws.Final Grade: B."
147,The Triplets of Belleville,9,18 February 2004,"A gorgeous, hilarious feast","I simply cannot say enough good things about this film, so I'll try to stick to the highest of the high points.Bruno, the dog, may well be the film's crowning achievement, for he is the truest cartoon representation of a dog I think I have ever seen. I especially love how for Bruno, finding Champion equals getting fed.The Triplets are beyond hilarious. I was fortunate to be the first one in the theater to realize what the fishing sister was about to do, so the other folks there had to put up with a few seconds of my uncontrollable laughter before they got it. I was, however, just as confused as anybody by the way the sisters refused to allow Mme. Souza to touch anything in their apartment, but when the payoff came later, I was in stitches.I even caught what I think were a few movie-geek in-jokes. Before the movie, one of the previews was mis-projected because the wrong lens was in place, and when ""Triplets"" first started, I was very afraid that the projectionist had somehow managed again to get the wrong lens, because the picture was very obviously ""window-boxed,"" meaning that there was a large portion of unlit screen visible to both sides of the image. However, we soon learn that we are watching a TV screen, and as the view pulls back from the tube, the full widescreen picture fills the screen. That's the setup. At the end of the film, we are again watching people watching TV, only this time, the image on the TV screen is a letterboxed presentation of a widescreen image. Very nice bookend.Original grade: 8 out of 10: very good, something, I'll want to see again.Revised grade (3/7/2012): 9 out of 10. Excellent. Worth seeing again and again."
148,The Triplets of Belleville,8,18 February 2004,Brilliant subtle sensory overload,"An animated co production from France-Canada and Belgium, The Triplets of Belleville tells the story of a champion cyclist who is kidnapped by an underworld crime syndicate during the Tour de France.  The grandmother and her trusty dog Bruno who raised and nurtured the kid go on an adventure to rescue her son, along with the help of three former triplets who sang and danced in the roaring twenties.However, this simple story line is not what draws the viewer in to its greatness, it is the world in which this story plays out that is a slight jolt to the senses in the most wonderful way.  The animation is filed with slow plodding but memorable characters, the dog particularly has to be on of the most realistic animals I have ever seen animated.  The backgrounds are LITTERED with detail and references; proportions of characters are completely `out of WACK' with the rest of their bodies.  The cyclists have drumsticks for legs, a grandma wears one giant platform shoe, the gangsters are menacingly and stupidly square.  It's quite ingenious, and I don't think I have seen animation like this ever.  The characters feel, look, and particularly the movements are what keeps you watching and glued to the screen as you anticipate what kind of freak oddity you may see next.There is little dialogue in the film, and to some degree I think that is done on purpose.  For the most part you really are suppose to absorb the crazy world these characters inhabit, such as the cities that stretch to teetering heights beyond the clouds, crowds of fat characters, and a delightful restaurant atmosphere that has the most memorable maitre d'.It's very difficult to put into words what this film is.  There is so much subtle sensory overload (if I could use no other word) that it is hard to keep track of everything.  But what emerges is a sense of playfulness and sly mockery of just about everything you can imagine.  It really is a great piece of eye candy and humorous adventure.  Definitely a must see.Rating 8 out of 10"
149,The Triplets of Belleville,10,15 February 2004,Puts American animated movies to shame.,"I loved this movie. My husband loved this movie. Friends that we ran into in the theater lobby as we were leaving loved this movie. From the sound of the applause after the credits (when was the last time you heard an audience applauding a movie?), the rest of the 80%-filled house loved this movie. This was a 6:00 p.m. showing on Valentine's Day, only one kid in the audience, about 10 years old, who was thoroughly absorbed throughout (he was sitting directly in front of me). Everyone else was 40-plus years of age; there is a market for movies for the over-30 crowd (are you listening, Hollywood?). There is no spoken dialogue in this French animated feature, but if I hadn't just told you, you probably wouldn't have realized. The animation is a visual feast. The opening sequence is a cinematic amuse bouche. Toward the end of it, a musical number, I wondered how, if, they were going to sustain that level of energy and innovation throughout the rest of the movie. The novelty of the animators' homage to Hollywood's golden era style of cartooning was so very clever. But was that to be it? Then surprise, the pantemporal story moves us to an entirely new and original cartoon form. It is in this new cartoon style that the present day storyline unfolds and we are introduced to our protagonist. Grandma. What a woman! How much better a world it would be had we all had such a gentle, dedicated and attentive parent. Throughout the rest of the movie, we are treated to yet other animators' artistic cartoon styles, seamlessly integrated into the story from the perspective of the characters. The dog's dreams are perfect extensions of his waking activities. For those who haven't seen this movie yet, I don't want to give any of these gems away and ruin it for you. There are just so many wonderful throwaway sight gags, such as how the grandmother's solution to the flat tire dilemma turns out.The plot is time-honored simplicity. It is the classic girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl gets boy and they live happily ever after. Only in ""Triplets of Belleville"", grandma loves boy, boy loves bicycle racing (pedaling, really), dog loves he-who-feeds-him (the boy), grandma (and dog) lose boy (to gangster types for underground sports betting events - think Christopher Walken in ""The Deer Hunter""). Grandma and dog set out on journey to recover boy, where along the way they meet up with supporting characters, the Triplets of Belleville among them (think geriatric French Andrews Sisters by way of the asylum in ""King of Hearts""). What makes this movie stand out is how the art, animation and music provide sumptuous detail to the story. As in most great art, there is a touch of the political and this movie doesn't fail to deliver in the coin of animation's realm. The urban development over the years around (and up against) the grandmother's house. There were moments of sheer genius in this movie due to the animators being keen observers of the world around them. We laughed, we ""awwwwww""ed, we got a little verklempt a couple of times (lumps in our throats). And I'm getting a whistle.P.S. You must stay through to the end of the credits. It ain't over 'til it's over."
150,The Triplets of Belleville,,13 February 2004,Great Little Masterpiece,"Great fun , its nice to see an inspired film now and then and this one was a little work of art. Most of the mainstream are too numb to appreciate it , I was glad I could see it  in an art house theater and sit amidst a small crowd of people like it was my own private screening."
151,The Triplets of Belleville,,9 February 2004,I hope this is only the first of many....,"I will see ""Triplets of Belleville"" again, because there's so much to it. Visually, it is a jewel.  And the characters are some of the best I've ever seen animated--the obsequious maitre-d' is absolutely amazing--I've been around a couple, and he's not really all that overdone.  I don't know what to say about cartoon characters like these--I almost expected a couple of minutes of outtakes and blunders at the end, because there were times I almost forgot that someone had drawn them.  What they do and how they look has nothing to do with a realistic style of portrayal, yet you get the feel that in order to make this film they did a lot of research on the people they were portraying.  Each character is very human (or dog), from the tiniest smile on Champion's face, to Madame's eyes behind her glasses, to the low-decibel whine of Bruno's frustrations.  And the triplets are stunning, both in the opening and later, when they are again performing. It's so hard to know what to say--I am still sort of reeling from the experience.  It's sort of like living through a storm at sea--no one will know what you are talking about until they have experienced it for themselves. See it.  Just see it."
152,The Triplets of Belleville,8,11 February 2004,"Quirky, beautiful and thought provoking","I find it hard to describe this wonderful treasure. It skewers so many of our beliefs, it turns our world upside down, even the music is apropos and insane at the same time (Mozart's Kyrie on a turbulent sea). The dog, I burst out laughing every time the dog raced to bark at the train and had these wild dreams where he was on the train and the passengers behind a window of a house barked at him, loved the huge dog plotting his manoeuvre to claim a tiny space on a small bed. Enchanting this whole wonderful crazy film. Club footed Grandma, did I mention her, dedicated trainer of world champion cyclists, and of course the Triplets. Our whole world is sent up in this. 8 out of 10, if there was any fault it occurred when the action moved to the ""New World"", New York, Montreal, who cares, and slowed some while Grandma sought her grandson. A rare and wonderful treat. The frogs. Who could forget them. I need to see this again, there is just so much to take in."
153,The Triplets of Belleville,,9 February 2004,This film is the most imaginative lampoon of 2 societies in at least a decade.,"When does strange become entertaining? When does satire become art? When does cartoon eclipse film? It all happens in writer/director Sylvain Chomet's French Canadian `The Triplets of Belleville.' Bypass your Burton (Tim, that is) and discover that this film is the most imaginative lampoon of 2 societies in at least a decade, maybe forever.The French live on a diet of frogs; Americans eat anything.  The French love bicycling (Think Tour de France); Americans love to watch them loving it. Both the French and the Americans are prone to exploit the culture for fun and profit. The plot is simple compared with the mise en scene. Grandma pursues crooks who have abducted her bicycle-racing grandson for gambling purposes.  The Triplets will be instrumental in helping grandma look for him.  Along the way we'll see Frenchmen dynamiting for frogs and Americans adoring a voluptuous, overweight Statue of Liberty.Chomat and company have layered so much pop-culture in with sociological profiling in `Triplets' that one must see the film several times to catch all the cross references (e.g., Don't miss the framed poster of `Mr. Hulot's Holiday,' the auto licenses expressing `In Vino Veritas,' or the frog-sicle!). The look is unique: a hand-drawn, digital combination of `Betty Boop,' `Felix the Cat,' and `Return of the King.'  The jazz score delivers the right tone of hip and haste. The style is more `South Park' than `Toy Story.'  If it were a documentary it would remind you of `Capturing the Friedmans' and ""American Splendor.""Have those witty French framed a narrative skewering American culture's ravenous profit mongering and egregious eating?  Yes, but it does fry the French as well. Although there is almost no dialogue, there is something for any imagination that tips like grandma's house to the left."
154,The Triplets of Belleville,8,9 February 2004,Fabulously Different,"I adore this film. From the first moment I heard the quirky opening title when I watched the preview, to the moment Mdme. Souza asked her grandson if it was over, I was hooked. I love every part of the little animated, soon to be classic. Taking from the old days of animation, the story combines adorable characters (Mdme. Souza reminds me so much of my grandma!), amazing animation, a dark, broody style and story line with moments of great comedy. Particularly funny to me was a short clip where Mdme. Souza plays the piano for the Triplettes, breaking into a nearly unrecognizable medley of traditional Portuguese songs. Just listening to that took me home. This breaks the boundaries of animated movies that are common in todays marketplace, bringing together a distinct vision and mesh of cultures and styles that is beyond anything we've seen in recent years.9/10 Highly recommended!!!"
155,The Triplets of Belleville,,1 February 2004,An amazing achievement!,"One reviewer commented that this film lacks joy. I found abundant joy; first, from my sides aching at the absolute hilarity of every scene, and second, in finding a truly original animated movie; neither glossed-over, white-bread Disney nor soulless cookie-cutter Anime. Life in the city is expressed as colorless; but the devotion of each character to one another is delightful. I can handle jokes of fat Americans; I particularly enjoyed the image of the man with Mickey Mouse and a ""sucker""; not to mention ""HollyFood"". The best comedy is rooted in the truth, and, to be fair, the French are insulted as well. This is a must-see for all of those who appreciate unconventional cinema and a good laugh. Also, the animation is groundbreaking, and at times, breathtaking."
156,The Triplets of Belleville,7,28 January 2004,"Excelent style, weird story and...","And one small thing I didn't like, the car chase scene. But let's take the story from the start.A young boy receives a bicycle and a dog for his birthday as a present from his granny and many years later he is ready for the Tour de France. The poor lad finds himself in a sinister plot of illegal cyclist races and the French Mafia in the New World... Only his poor old grandma can save him now!The story unfolds through a unique animation style and characters with exaggerated appearances. The artist has a unique way of putting across all the feelings and thoughts of each and every one of those cartoons.The plot is not at weird as the 1998 Old Lady and the Pigeons but it is certainly told the same weird way.All in all it is a great film. I liked it a lot and I will watch it again and again just to absorb the strong images of the weird old ladies and their musical appliances..."
157,The Triplets of Belleville,8,11 January 2004,Clever comedy and just plain fun to watch,"I went to go see this film having heard nothing about it before buying my ticket. That said, I can't speak to whether it lives up to any particular hype, but I thoroughly enjoyed it throughout. More than anything, I was impressed by how clearly this story was told using almost nothing but visuals. This might not sound like a big deal, but it really is...there's a very nice balance struck here, in that the viewer is intrigued by plot points that have yet to be explained but not confused by tons of hanging threads. This kind of tension is hard to maintain when one has the luxury of dialogue, so achieving it with a more or less non-verbal film is quite cool. Finally, I say ""clever"" comedy since this is a very nice example of a film that feels complete because almost everything we see onscreen becomes a small part of the larger story structure. Very little gets thrown away in this film, and the closer you watch, the more you notice how many small details were left for the viewer to find by him or herself. That kind of care makes a movie like this a treasure hunt for the audience, and as such, I would highly recommend it. Is it European? Yes. Is it different? Yes. Is it the sign of a new wave of animation which will turn the world on it's ear? I doubt it. But it's well done start-to-finish, and that alone makes it worth checking out."
158,The Triplets of Belleville,8,17 January 2004,Not For Everyone but Brilliant,"This is a simple story turned inside out and upside down. It is the result of too many sweets before bedtime; or a bad ham sandwich. I'll never eat frog legs after this! You stare at the screen, mouth agape, and try to take it all in. You can't. It's surreal cinema at it's best. You wouldn't want a steady diet of this but until now you haven't even had that option. Can't stop humming that damned tune."
159,The Triplets of Belleville,,5 January 2004,"I wanted to love it, but I'll settle for liking it","Not quite sure what brought this one up short.  Normally I'm a total sucker for this sort of thing, but Triplets never quite connected for me.  Many of the characters (especially champion) seemed to have no personality whatsoever, and the rest were precisely one dimensional.  Grandmother > stalwart and measured, no matter how big or small the problem is.  The triplets = whimsical.  The fact that 15 minutes into the movie you knew exactly how everyone was going to react to every situation sucked the life out of it."
160,The Triplets of Belleville,,12 January 2004,hypnotic,"I think that I was just Svengali'd. I went to see ""Les Triplettes de Belleville"" yesterday, and for the rest of the day I found myself having these bizarre little mini blackouts. I'm convinced that the film hypnotized me. It's quirky pacing, and cryptic imagery seems to have gotten the better of my fragile psyche.  It feels like I'm living the Manchurian Candidate, I did enjoy the film on certain level and I would recommend it to others however, I would caution  people who are easily hypnotized or highly impressionable to stay away."
161,The Triplets of Belleville,,11 January 2004,A Visually Wild Tribute to Older Women,"I went to see ""Les Triplettes de Belleville"" on the recommendation of my 19-year-old son, so was delighted to find that it is an exuberant, imaginative tribute to older women, not a group usually saluted in animation or comic book art, from which creator Sylvain Chomet, doing his first feature-length animation, hails, or in the early work of Ralph Bakshi, that this film otherwise reminds me of.  All the characters and landscapes are absurdly exaggerated caricatures that are also endearing, from French chanteuses eating frogs to urban development run amuck as commuter trains just miss old houses at full speed.  Virtually dialogue-free, the film salutes Chomet's cinematic comic influences, such as Jacques Tati, with visual tributes. The story, charming as it is of a grandmother's devotion to her grandson and determination to rescue him from kidnapping gangsters, is helped enormously by Benoît Charest's disjointedly jazzy score and especially by the eponymous singing group's signature song ""Belleville Rendez-Vous"" by Mathieu Chedid (available in both French and English on the soundtrack album)."
162,The Triplets of Belleville,,25 December 2003,And The Tadpoles jumped Over The Moon,"When you watch a film, wherein a saucepanful of dried,cooked tadpoles, transforms into the moon, you can expect the weird and wonderful. It is both, but is not the complete film it might have been. An almost silent, French animated adventure, I wondered if Walt Disney wasn't so much turning in his grave, than being reincarnated as a boggle-eyed henchman, as there is a passing resemblance to the 'French Mafia' villains. Actually they looked like Boycie from 'Only fools and horses' but I wasn't going to mention that. This is possibly the strangest animation I've seen but I'm not a regular in his field. I'm a 'Finding Nemo'/'Peter Pan' sort of person - you know, the clown fish who never wants to grow up. Here, watching this, I wondered if I was coming or coming, and I'm not being rude. Some of the ideas reminded me of Monty Python mixed with 'Wacky Races', mixed with about a hundred other memories. The film does run out of steam, I thought, when the kidnapping of the cyclist gets underway, but never ceases to hold some interest. I did guess that there would be some reason why the fridge was empty; newspapers could not be read; and the hoover left redundant, but a lot of the visual punchlines were unexpected, especially the tyre substitute. I think I'll stick to 'Nemo' but this is very watchable, although not quite the classic some have made it out to be. My favourite character was the waiter. A creation of genius (although my imagination saw John Cleese serving Mr Creosote!)7/10."
163,The Triplets of Belleville,,1 December 2003,Different and bizarre but definitely entertaining,"If you only think of Disney and Pixar when you think of feature length animated films, look elsewhere.  However, if you're a big fan of old Tex Avery cartoons or enjoy absurdity for absurdity's sake you'll love TOB. Yes, the pace, narrative and lack of dialogue makes it unconventional viewing, but it succeeds nonetheless.  Probably deserves multiple viewings to appreciate everything that's going on."
164,The Triplets of Belleville,8,27 November 2003,"Sweet, quirky and delightful","This beautifully rendered film is a perfect way to while away a chilly autumn afternoon. It creates a universe where the bizarre is natural and believable, and where human values, even scatological ones, are honored and redeemed. Plus, that off-kilter music is a real gem. I can only hope that someone like Kid Loco or Dimitri of Paris gets his hands on those tapes and makes a masterpiece of turntablist art out of its haunting harmonies."
165,The Triplets of Belleville,,20 November 2003,Awesome. DO NOT MISS THIS WINNER!!,"Awesome and then some!! Such an enjoyable film. When I saw it the audience burst into spontaneous applause over the end credits and I joined them.I've never seen a movie with so many jokes per square inch. And stunningly drawn with a terrific soundtrack too. Loved it.Maybe, it's only 9/10 for me rather than the full ten because the Belleville (New York? Montreal?) section is a bit less inventive for me than the earlier Paris section. In the Paris part I just loved the shot of the house pushed skew so the railway viaduct could pass through. But in New York/Belleville we've got the joke that all New Yorkers are fat pigs, we don't need it again. And the fact that the building is the HQ of French Wine and has two giant wine bottles on the roof isn't that hilarious as gags go. A friend has tried to persuade me that the slowing of the pace and the thinning of the gag-rate is deliberate but I'm not convinced.Having said that, the Belleville section has the frog-harvest-by-grenade great joke and best of all, the dried tadpoles making popcorn!!! And then the pan of ""popcorn"" effortlessly and pointlessly becoming the moon. Lovely stuff, genius even.Btw, the film here in the UK is called ""Belleville Rendezvous"". Why?? Wouldn't we understand the word Triplet(tte)s?? Surely the director has the right to decide his film's title??"
166,The Triplets of Belleville,,18 October 2003,You shouldn't miss it,"It's a long time I didn't see a great animation movie. It doesn't constantly catch your attention, I think it's also due to the the fact that very few words are spoken (three or four in the whole movie), but the soundtrack is fantastic, the characters really funny (strange but cute -it resembled me Bruno Bozzetto style, sometimes), and the animation is SUPERB, with a wise conjunction between traditional 2d and some 3d animation (but the first, standing out in the fluid motion and beautiful colours, is the one that I appreciated mostly). If you like animation you shouldn't miss it."
167,The Triplets of Belleville,,8 October 2003,"Great film, DO NOT MISS IT.","This is not a tribute to Jacques Tati. It is facile to assume that it is just because a poster of Monsieur Hulots Holiday appears briefly and that there is little dialogue. It is, however a unique and delightful film combining charm, artistry and Gallic quirkiness. If it owes any homage it would be to the slightly surreal films of Fernandel. Marvellous characterisation, makes current disney efforts look jaded. A real MUST SEE."
168,The Triplets of Belleville,,20 August 2003,Fantastic!,Saw this at the 2003 Edinburgh International Film Festival. Was blown away by the great storyline and fantastic animation. Both the traditional 2D and the 3D animation was superb with lots of interesting in-jokes the the background to keep you looking. Recommended to anyone at all interested in animation.
169,The Triplets of Belleville,7,24 July 2003,I want a grandmother like that!,"Lovely film, and since I am usually not that much into animated cartoons, that means a lot! Little Champion, who lives with his grandmother, is absolutely adorable, as is his nana, who stands solidly behind him no matter what. With the aid of formerly famous trio singers 'les triplettes de Belleville', who lead somewhat strange lives when it comes to housekeeping and food, she saves him from the French mafia. You should probably see it twice to capture all the visual details. There are a lot of references to the 'stereotypical French'. Do wait until the end of the closing credits!"
170,The Triplets of Belleville,8,26 June 2003,a UFO...,"this is by far one of the most surprising movie I have seen in a long time...First, its style is unique, the animation techniques are used in a very clever way, giving the movie a mixed look not seen onto the screen: from the 1920's black and white opening which at first looks misplaced, until you understand the genius behind placing 80 years old humour in the opening, later some scenes are given a unique ""Belgian's strip"" (its not quite comics) touch, by the end you will see one of the most surprising car chase ever (a Limousine version of the old Citroen 2cv...). But all this is just about the look of the picture...When you come to characters, you realize everybody depicted there is a caricature: small Frenchies with big red wine-filled noses, fat americans, stupid boy scout, mafia bodyguards, and let's not forget the (fantastic, hilarous, marvelous) doggie.. this one is a blast... you even get to see Mickey Mouse himself if you really pay attention... but let's say ""in a not very respectfull posture""... yep the message is clear, the mouse is not the movie maker's favorite animated character... I would say that most of what is shown is a caricature of what you usually see on the bigscreen...But above everything else, you have the storyline, what to say about it ? don't know... the writer had the genius to tell a story without a single line of dialogue (sometimes you can hear someone's speaking but it's more part of the soundtrack...) but it deserves the movie very well, there is no *need* of diaogue there, situations are clear enough to understand what is going on. So what is the plot ? beleive me it is twisted... and better unspoiled...There is one warning though: this is not the politically correct childish garbage you take the kids to, this is an adult feature, some scenes are quite unadapted to children, and that makes the movie great !"
171,The Triplets of Belleville,1,13 May 2009,Absolutely the Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,"For almost 40 years, the worst movie I had ever seen was ""Billyjack,"" followed by the second worst movie, ""Return of Billyjack."" Frankly, I was feeling a bit old, a bit behind the times, a bit out of it, for not being able to update the top of my ""Worst Movie List"" with a more current selection.But then along came ""The Triplets of Belleville,"" a film that is so unremittingly ugly and bleak and just horrible that I still have flashbacks to watching it.First Question - What do the filmmakers have against poor Josephine Baker? Big lips, Big breasts, Big banana skirt all flapping together while she sings off-key; I can't think of a more cruel and insulting and just plain inaccurate caricature of a talented performer.Second Question - Why does the Grandmother bother to rescue the Grandson? His life at home didn't seem any better than being a captive racer for rich people. He still has to be in this movie after all.Yuck!"
172,The Triplets of Belleville,2,8 February 2004,Amongst one of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"I feel very alone right now. I have just seen the movie and I found it absolutely horrendous, and I realise that I am about the only person who thinks this.Granted, the animation is incredibly original and novel, but beyond that (i.e. the first 10 minutes) I found no redeeming features in the film. The characters are grotesque, and not even in an amusing way: the characterisation is so one dimensional that I felt no empathy with any of them. The storyline is frankly bizarre: don't talk to me about neo-surrealism, it's a completely silly plot."
173,The Triplets of Belleville,1,26 December 2005,Awful film,"I hate this movie. I watched it in my English lesson, and I was so bored. My friend actually fell asleep during it. The animation was very dodgy. The boy's legs were an odd shape. He aged while his grandmother didn't. The dog was really fat and looked nothing like a dog. The characters hardly spoke, and when they did it did nothing to help the movie. The lack of speech made the movie hard to understand. The plot was not very interesting anyway, and hardly any of it made any sense. I didn't know why people did what they did. It was a waste of an English lesson. I recommend not viewing this movie, unless you want to be seriously bored and confused. No-one else in my class liked it and I give it 1 out of 10."
174,The Triplets of Belleville,3,13 November 2004,Tedious and depressing,"Triplettes has an intriguing style that makes it reasonable to expect that the movie itself will be funny and imaginative, but such is not the case. I don't think animation has to be humorous, but if it is trying to be humorous and failing miserable then there's a real problem. Most of Triplettes gags fall, and the occasional ones that don't tend to just be mildly amusing.The film is also remarkably depressing for something that is filled with attempts at humor. Everything about this is grim and lifeless, with characters who have no personality but just grind through their lives with a single-minded, passionless determination. The story is slight and takes forever to tell, leaving lots of room for the movie's myriad failed attempts at humor. After about an hour I couldn't take it anymore and fast-forwarded through the rest of the movie to see what happened, but I'm still not sure and honestly I don't much care. I have no idea why so many people here are raving about this, it's really painful."
175,The Triplets of Belleville,1,31 March 2004,Torture,"Do not watch this movie. If you have a choice between watching this or picking lint out of your navel, go for the lint. The pace of T de B movie is slow and painful. You are forced to watch simple things (like pedaling a bike) go on...and on...and on. There is no dialog, and nothing redeems the characters annoying, plodding behavior. The music in this movie perfectly captures the movie's spirit: annoying and unengaging. The only reason I didn't walk out is the glowing reviews of people who must have never seen anything more interesting than paint drying before. Actually, paint would have been more fun to watch. I'd write more about how terrible this movie is, but I can't stand to think about it any more."
176,The Triplets of Belleville,5,27 January 2005,"I'll grant that it's a work of art, but certainly not for everyone.","When I looked up this movie on the IMDb the first thing I saw was a review by someone praising Triplets of Belleville as a work of art, which it undoubtedly is. On the other hand, the same review called it captivating, which it's not. At all. I recently returned from being on vacation for 6 weeks, during which time I watched countless movies and yet was itching to get home to where I had movie passes at Hollywood and Blockbuster. During my entire vacation my girlfriend was constantly trying to get me to watch Triplets of Belleville, and I was wildly uninterested just because I'm not a huge fan of animated movies, for the most part, and just the look of the animation made it look not very interesting to me.Not a very good reason for not being interested in a movie, by judging it by its cover, but it turns out that I was right. I think Triplets is an interesting accomplishment in that it tries something different (or at least far less commonplace) by telling its entire story without a single line of dialogue other than what is occasionally sung in songs. The story concerns a grandmother who's son has been kidnapped during the Tour de France, along with a couple of other cyclists who did not make it through the race, and she and her dog Bruno set off for America to rescue him.The film garnered a couple of Academy Award nominations, such as Best Animated Feature (a futile nomination, as it was nominated alongside Finding Nemo, and we all know that artistry is no match for popularity in the Oscars) and Best Song for the routine that the Triplets perform in the film, which is one of the few elements that I found to be pretty charming. I guess I shouldn't say that, because the movie does have a lot of charm, but it's shrouded in what is often obscure artistry that I found a bit confusing and not very entertaining, which is even more odd since I'm something of an amateur marathon cyclist myself.I understand if you think I'm shallow, I certainly thought that people who called the animated short film Bunny (included on the Ice Age DVD) shallow or confusing astounded me to no end, but when I was watching Triplets I was reminded of those odd cartoons that come on TV late at night. Triplets of Belleville would have been a perfect show to show on adult swim, which we can thank for such hilarious cartoons as Aquateen Hungerforce and Family Guy, but as a full length feature film I found it to be stretched a bit thin."
177,The Triplets of Belleville,2,19 July 2016,Quite possibly the most boring thing since watching paint dry,"I have two problems with this movie. First, as my title indicates, it is boring. It is ungodly, irredeemably boring. There were times in the movie where I had to fast forward as I couldn't take the nothing that was going on. They seem to not like speaking too much in this film so a lot of the film is bathed in awkward silence with barely any music, which only punctuates how flat and boring it is. I mean, yeah the finale was...okay, but that doesn't excuse over an hour of nothing.The second biggest thing is the animation. Dear god is this film ugly. Yeah, I know it's stylized, but that does not excuse the fact that the style is UGLY. Just because you MEANT it to be ugly, doesn't make it any less ugly. The characters are bland, and as they hardly talk they are made even MORE bland, and the backgrounds don't help with their surreal blandness.This is one of those movies where when you are watching you go 'man...I could be doing something else right now' and that is the number one sin a movie can possibly make. Questioning why you are watching it.Is it the most painful and horrible animated movie ever? ...no, it's just ungodly boring. I don't care how different it is, or how it took a chance, or how surreal it is. If it is boring, it's still boring no matter what kind of bow you put on it. Not for kids, not for teens, not for adults...I would say the only time you should watch this movie is if you are an art student and need a film to write a report on. Other than that...give this one a skip."
178,The Triplets of Belleville,1,4 July 2016,One of the most repulsive things I've ever seen.,"I watched this movie in French class last year. Not a single person in my class liked it. It was foul and disgusting, but not in the sense of something like vomit. It was more of a ""get out of my face"" kind. It's just such an ugly film I wish I could give it a 0. I've watched it in both French and English, and neither was a pleasant experience. I know somebody who said it was their favorite animated film, and nobody there knew about the film, except me. We were arguing, but he couldn't really say anything against what I was saying other than ""It was supposed to be like that."" I would say it was boring or it was ugly, but he wouldn't listen. It's not odd or charming like a Miyazaki film. It's ugly and repulsive like Batman Returns."
179,The Triplets of Belleville,,24 July 2011,Analysis of Imagery,"Madame Souza's Super Powers Two scenes are analyzed here form a brilliant short film about a Grandmothers journey to getting her grandson to the Tour de France bicycle race and eventually saving him after he is kidnapped by a group of mob men. In the first scene, the tiny kitchen looks even smaller with the over the top clutter that fills it. Along the walls: plates, tea sets, wine bottles, a bike frame, pots, and pans all line wooden board panels. An antique, rusty record player stands in a corner. In the opposite corner, a full trash bin accompanies an aged steel heater. The already overcrowded walls hold picture frames that tilt to one side. In the center of the room above a round kitchen table, there is a brittle light fixture. The light sways back and forth lighting the room with dull light bulbs. Madame Souza is standing on top of her table. The old woman is elf- sized and plump. She hovers over her grandson, Champion, who is on his hands and knees on top of the table too. His feet dangle over the edge of the table as she vigorously scrubs his shoulders after a long day of bike riding. Champion's eyes are closed. His back arches with hunched shoulders. As the night grows, the scene ends Madame dragging the giant to bed. Later in the film, the second scene is positioned mountainside during the Tour de France race. The driver and Madame Souza have pulled over on the side of the road due to a tire malfunction. Madame Souza is standing with one foot forward supporting her body as she leans over the older man that drives her van. She has both hands on her rounded hips, and constantly blows a whistle cradled in her mouth. With furrowed eyebrows, the driver bends over- focused on trying to fix the popped tire. She is anxious to get back on the road to keep track of her grandson during the race. In both of these images from Les Triplettes de Belleville, Sylvain Chomet portrays a distinct gender role switch- empowering the female role and diminishing the dominant male perception. The two scenes are in direction toward a group of outer-directed consumers. Many people have very set views of the male and female roles in our society. Both of these scenes portray a reversed dominance in the traditional view of leadership by a male and following logic from the female. While Madame Souza stands in her kitchen with Champion, she is above him, even though he is three times her size. Her gaze is looking downward onto Champion. His eyes are closed. His body in a prayer position with his shoulders arching down. He shows reverence to his grandmother as she scrubs his back. Similarly, Madame stands a whole head above the the truck driver when they are on the side of the mountain. Both of her eyes are looking through her nose at the old man. Obediently, he looks down at the task that Madame is urging he finishes. Her nose points upward in a posh shrewdness. The driver keeps his head below his shoulders in compliance with her orders. In both scenes however, the angle of the camera is at eyelevel. This angle gives the viewer a rhetorical perspective of equality with the characters, therefore creating equilibrium between the audience and characters. In the kitchen scene with Champion and Madame Souza, we are overwhelmed with a feeling of clutter and chaos. In traditional views, the role a woman is to keep and maintain the house. This observation includes the idea of keeping the home clean and neat at all time- at least to try. Madame Souza does not show this characteristic. Her objective is inclined to training and coaching Champion for the race. The imagery of ""coaching"" replicates in the second seen with the driver as well. Normally the word ""coach"" associates itself with a male. However, Madame Souza takes the role of the coach and blows the whistle at the old man in this scene. Chomet uses color and specific detail in the animation to represent the ideas intended for a parallel audience. The driver is wearing scruffy overalls that infer is a lower class worker. Madame Souza wears worn out clothes, a sweater that has patches on her elbows. The colors and wardrobe of the cartoons evoke an idea that they belong to a lower middle class group. The detail by Chomet effectively demonstrates his point of view concerning the female role in the film. She and her assistants in the film are the ""heroes."" Throughout the film, Madame Souza carries a tremendous character of leadership, which completely contradicts our view of an elderly woman in society today. She exceeds the role of a woman demonstrating: power, will, nurture, and protection for her loved ones. I believe this short film is inspiring to try the hardest one can at any given point and time in life. The grandma instructs no one should give up no matter how tough any situation may seem. The human anatomy is only flesh and bones. The soul is the strength and will that comes from within."
180,The Triplets of Belleville,6,21 September 2008,Mediocre,"The film is far too long, at 90 minutes. It could have been greatly heightened by being cut in ½, or preferably to 1/3 its length. It suffers from what much of silent films suffer from, in retrospect. The propulsion of the narrative by broad sweeping gestures is innately heightening, condensing, therefore many of the scenes later on, in the film, become mere recapitulations of earlier scenes whose points were made. Such concision invites imbuement, not explanation, & while the purpose of the tale is never explained, too many needless little bits of exposition are- such as Bruno's dream, or the montage showing the extended oddities of the triplets, since, just 1 look at them, & 1 instance adequately set them up as weirdos we feel something for. Many critics have pointed out that the film has many layers of throwaway references & tweaks- be it comments on Hollywood & organized crime's financial connections, to pot shots taken at Walt Disney, to homages to obscure cartoon stars of the Great Depression. These may all be true, & heighten the film to its lovers, but to impartial tastes they tend to distract from the overall thrust of the film, which has many virtues- focus not being 1 of them.As for the DVD, there are requisite making of films & a commentary, but anyone expecting any deeper explication of the film itself will be disappointed. Yet, that's a good thing for, flawed as it is, The Triplets Of Belleville deserves accolades for at least trying to be something unique. That it won an Oscar for it is more of a comment on what its competition lacked than what it possessed. Which may be, in retrospect, the very point of Madame Souza's devotion to her grandson, & why so many people connected with it."
181,The Triplets of Belleville,6,19 April 2008,"Boring, but with some nice ideas.....","This film has some clever ideas, and you can tell that it is a French cartoon. It has a distinctly Gallic feel to it.The animation is very well done, and the overall tone of the piece is interesting, and very anti-Disney.The music is okay, but nothing special. Personally, Jazz is my least favourite musical genre, therefore my opinion on the soundtrack will probably differ from other people's.My problem is that the film drags and drags. Towards the end, I felt like fast-forwarding it to the credits, as the slow pace made me feel tired.This film is definitely worth watching. I just don't believe it's worth watching twice."
182,The Triplets of Belleville,10,23 June 2005,"Sylvain Chomet's ""The Triplets of Belleville""  has a Latvian connection","French director Sylvain Chomet's ""The Triplets of Belleville,"" one of three Academy Award nominees for best animated film, has a Latvian connection, Latvian state television reports. The Latvian company Rija Films was one of four animation studios that worked on the movie, doing what is known as ""tweening"" between distinct images. Formed in 1995, Rija Films has been involved in a number of well-known local projects, including the 1990 animation and CD-ROM ""Velnini"" (Little Devils) and the 2001 animation ""Vai Riga jau gatava?"" (The National Hero), according to the Web site of the National Film Centre. The studio is run by Vilnis Kalnaellis. Rija Films was chosen for the work because of budgetary reasons, ""Triplets"" Art Director Evgeni Tomov said in an interview with AnimWatch, an online journal. Another latest example of co-operation in this field is ""Kirikou et la Sorciere"" done by Latvian animation company ""Rija""."
183,The Triplets of Belleville,9,24 May 2005,One of the most beautiful movies you'll see this year,"Words cannot describe the charm of this movie; it has to be seen. Whether or not you're an animation buff (but even more so if you are), the beauty of Sylvain Chomet's 'Les Triplets De Belleville' is near irresistible. Forget the story; forget the French oddball humor, the vast cultural references, and the gorgeous jazzy music. These are all great - but they're not for everyone's taste, and that I can understand. The animation, though, the characters and the locations are beautiful beyond words. The facial expressions and the movements of the characters are grotesquely over-the-top - and yet are unbelievably convincing. Each of the characters is a fantastic work by itself with a very unique personality, from Champion (as child and adult), his grandmother and of course the wonderful triplets themselves, right down to the dog, Bruno - who is in fact one of the most charming characters in the movie; as well as every single one of the one-shot characters, like the bulky, oafish boy scout, or the mouse-faced, stuffed-nosed mechanic. Not one of them is placed without thought and consideration. Every facial expression is considered and carefully used. The backgrounds, too, are deliberately planned and created, right down to the coloring - notice the vast difference in colors between the nostalgia of Champion's childhood, to modern day Paris, to the summery brightness of the Tour de France, to the bustling modernism of Belleville. Belleville itself is one of the most important creations of this movie, being - as Chomet describes it - a fusion of New York, Paris and Montreal, and in his hands it comes to full life. The use of computer animation is soft and subtle, and blends wonderfully into the film; even in the few scenes when it takes over the classic animation, it still combines well.I honestly feel that to say too much about 'Les Triplets' would be a waste; if you've seen even a few minutes of it, you know what I'm talking about. If you didn't, go and watch it as soon as possible. It's one of the most beautiful movies you'll see this year."
184,The Triplets of Belleville,7,29 March 2005,"Fat Americans are a reality, not anti-American propaganda","The film has some hilarious scenes, and although the main idea is not always clear, it is nevertheless enjoyable. I must emphasize that the film didn't have anti-American propaganda. I don't think showing the reality is doing negative propaganda. The reality of the US (not America, because America is the whole continent) is that of a decadent culture filled with fat greedy people with no self-respect for themselves. People who have replaced religion, for the TV set. This obviously doesn't apply to everyone, but that's the common image most strangers have. What freedom can you have when you're obsessed with food and think in nothing different from pleasure and leisure? Hence, i don't think saying the truth is doing anti-American propaganda."
185,The Triplets of Belleville,9,11 December 2004,"Characters are portrayed excellently, dialogue would ruin it","This movie has a unique sense of honesty. About life of a dog, son and grandmother. The support the grandmother gives, the notes, pictures and diary of the son and how they developed over twenty odd years. The significant things each of the three's lives.Very simple, but not a dull, storyline. Events and character-developments conveyed very effectively and effortlessly with pictures (some telling a thousand words).Nothing is fancy, no blockbuster type of decisions were made, like young cast or beautiful females or any heroic features. This is just simple, funny and very natural entertainment. Warning! It is not a blockbuster type movie. There is no heroic action or exaggerated drama involved. Just enjoy it!! Note: In my opinion a deaf person would also enjoy this movie."

187,The Triplets of Belleville,,5 December 2004,Brilliant and Eccentric,"I love the film-making sensibility of the writer/director of this film. In most films that come out of Hollywood, you don't give a damn about any of the characters. Not because they are good or bad, but because they are cardboard and boring. In this film, you will truly empathize with the sad little trio of characters (the grandma, the grandson, and the bloodhound).There are so many parts in this film that just blow your mind, where you say, ""What was that all about?"" Like the Belleville sisters who are hooked on eating frogs in a variety of disgusting dishes. The director creates his own unique vision without coming off as self indulgent. The whole thing is brilliant."
188,The Triplets of Belleville,10,28 November 2004,Gets better after each viewing,"When I first saw The Triplets of Belleville, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. I was certainly impressed with the use of 2D and 3D animation, and the overall weirdness kept me interested. Then I saw it again and again, until it finally got to the point that I couldn't get enough of it.Sylvain Chomet has clearly put a lot of work into this movie and it shows throughout the entire movie. Even as strange as the characters and the animation is, it still looks very believable, and the bizarre humor shines beautifully. All I can say us the character, Bruno the dog, stole quite a few scenes with his hatred of trains, particularly the scene where they were eating frogs for dinner.In all I have to say this is a great movie, although I wouldn't recommend this for kids. A few scenes might not be appropriate and I doubt many would have the patients or the ability to understand it completely. But it is a must for animation buffs."
189,The Triplets of Belleville,,17 November 2004,Makes Disney look amateurish,"Quel joy! (I never studied French to my regret--Latin/Spanish here) Not since my first Disney film which I saw as a wee tot with my mother in the old Guild Theatre have I been so mezmerized! In such a copycat world, this is surely a treat for the eyes and the ears. Not only did I enjoy the animation, but I have not stopped humming and prancing about my apartment (thank God I have shades)to the snap-fingered jazzy theme score. Such a delightful feast for the senses. I always wondered what it must have felt like to have seen the first silent movie and be enthralled by the visual feast in front of you. This kind of entertainment is what it's all about--celebrating creativity and life with a true insight and gift of seeing into what is most human and real in all of us, warts included."
190,The Triplets of Belleville,10,9 October 2004,"unique and creative animation and mystique, a surprise treat","Les Triplettes de Belleville provides unique and creative animation and mystique, a surprise treat with a characteristic European flair. The caricatures of French life, cycling, and culture of the 1930's combine to create an ambiance that has not been done before in film. Punctuated with humor and irony, this animation is a must-see for young and old alike, especially for those with an interest in those visions of life that extend beyond the Hollywood silver screen. The film not only appeals on a general level, but also for bicycling aficionados. Les Triplettes de Belleville is highly recommended for those who enjoy fresh animation, musical history and dry witty humor. Ironically, there's hardly a spoken word in the entire film-- the film simply works on a visual and musical level."
191,The Triplets of Belleville,10,3 September 2004,Les Triplettes de Belleville,"Let me start by saying that this is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen, right up there with ""Nightmare before Christmas"" and ""Spirited away"". But let me also say that it's a movie very liable to get a lot of hate. But not from me. I totally connected with it. Even more, I wish I had this movie around when I was a kid.Many people grow up and forget how it was to be a kid. So, some kids are dumb and like saccharine-filled stories filled with politically correct humour. But most are not. There's an essential cruelty to being a little kid. Everyone underestimates your opinions, keeps secrets from you and looks at you tenderly even while you're thinking of different ways your grandma could choke on a muffin. Very few people remember that sort of thing. Roald Dahl and Tim Burton comes to mind. And the director of this wonderful film.It's hard to describe the experience of watching it, really. It's practically a silent animation movie with a very deadpan, ""Pink Panther"" meets Saki comedy vibe. It doesn't try to meet expectations and all. It just does whatever it wants. Bare tits and exploding frogs are all over the place, sharing space with more tender and innocent jokes and the natural appeal of the expertly drawn characters. There's a very dreamlike sense in the way events happen. The three old hags of the title, the boy who rides a bycicle, the grandma and her dog, the gangsters, they are all creatures that seem to be imagined by a young kid who doesn't understand the world, or understands it too much for its own good. Sometimes a naive person can do a wonderful cynic.Just watch it. Not all movies are made to talk about them. This one eludes commentary. It is what it is, and it's perhaps one of the most brilliant achievements of the new millennium."
192,The Triplets of Belleville,6,27 June 2004,Interesting,"This movie was unique, odd, and interesting. It had some funny parts, and the Belleville Rendezvous song is very good and catchy. The animation was entertaining. However, it was not realistic at all, which is okay, but it, in my opinion, is lacking a little in the plot. It's so weird that its hard to understand it in full, which isolated me from the movie. There were a number of scenes where it was really difficult to understand (spoiler ahead), especially the last scene when the boy (as an old man) says, ""I know what to say to you Grandma, Its the end"" or something like that. I did not understand what he meant, and when I don't understand the end, then I really don't understand the movie. How the movie is made makes it impossible, or at least very difficult to understand.It's not the greatest movie in the least, but its worth seeing because of its creativity, animation, comedyAlmost too weird to rate, but here's my rating: 6/10"
193,The Triplets of Belleville,,15 June 2004,Great,"I am not an animation connoisseur, but I thought the animation in this movie was very entertaining. The exaggerations did speak volumes and I chose not to be offended that Belleville looked remarkably like New York and that all the citizens were giant and obese. I thought the dark-eyed and morose child Champion was eloquent along with his exaggerated body when he became a Tour de France competitor. Mdme. Souza's tall shoe was comical, her constantly misdirected eye and the little clink it made when she adjusted her glasses was a detail that lent her character. The ship that took the Tour competitors off to Belleville was also amusing, and it's hugeness an indication of things to come. The titular triplets were an absolute scream.Everything about them was just crazy and wonderful. I loved their outfits in the opening cabaret. I loved the one sister's edema-puffed ankles slopping over her pumps and that they all wore mouldy old stoles. The thing with the frogs was hilarious. The best part about the movie, though, was the music. I had to have the soundtrack after I saw the movie. Some of the best music I've ever heard.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. You don't notice there is no dialog. Well, after a while you don't notice. I suppose about 10 minutes into the movie, I did think, ""I guess there's no dialog."" But after that, I didn't think about it again. I just enjoyed the heck out of the movie."
194,The Triplets of Belleville,,23 May 2004,"Quirky, yet compelling","Just rented this.. it was really quirky, quite unusual, yet funny. There must be some great minds behind this movie, I saw I think 11 different and interesting :D ways to take out French Mafia cars... The plot is brought forth amazingly, seeing as there is no INTENTIONAL dialogue in the movie aside from 2 lines at the end. There's lots of symbolism in the movie that's worth understanding when you get it. Also, look for various visual Easter Eggs, such as when the Mafia is holding the betting event onthe three bikers and the movie screen, one biker is shot by a henchman. The smoke coming from the henchman's gun, at the top of the screen, takes the form of a dead man's face. The various metaphors in the movie, such as the bikers making various horse noises, suggesting that they are being worked like horses. All in all, the weirdness was ""unweirded"" when you think and understand everything."
195,The Triplets of Belleville,6,6 March 2004,It's good...I just didn't get into it  (**1/2),"A highly bizarre, surreal animated film from France, this is the largely wordless story of a sullen bicycle racer named Champion who is kidnapped by some shady thugs and brought to the giant metropolis of Belleville, and of his caring grandmother and dog, Bruno, who come to rescue him.
The critics are raving over this interesting little movie, but while I could certainly appreciate its creativity and incredible visual beauty (when it isn't focusing on grotesque characters or filth), it just didn't really sustain my interest. I love to be immersed in other worlds, though, and the world in this movie (""surreal"" doesn't quite do it justice) truly is something to behold, so I'm glad I saw it. I also loved Bruno and the grandmother (who is quite the tough little lady), and the great featured song. A totally worthy movie in many ways, it just didn't quite do it for me."
196,The Triplets of Belleville,6,23 February 2004,visual smorgasbord,"It will be hard to describe in one paragraph what The Triplets of Bellville actually is, much less what happens.  I will try to start with basics.  It is a French cartoon that does not lend itself to any of the major animated movie categories (Disney, Pixar, Anime).  Its opening sequence feels like one of the original cartoons from the 20's, like say Steamboat Willie, then the animation turns into a wild impressionistic style where ordinary things are out of proportion and discolored.  The story involves the Tour de France, The American Mob, an overweight dog, no understandable dialogue, and lots of frogs.  To get a little bit better idea of this one, try checking out the trailer at www.apple.com/trailers/sony/thetripletsofbellville.html. 	I see lots and lots of movies and it is not very often when I go into one and within ten minutes of the movie starting, know exactly where it is going and how it is going to end.  In this aspect, Triplets, was quite refreshing. I was not even sure where it went after it was over.  The mind boggling animation flick had elements that were magical, some that borderline disgusting, but unfortunately on the whole was pretty boring (especially considering its quaint run time of only 80 minutes).  It feels like everything you are seeing on the screen is highly allegorical, but the images come so fast that your brain almost blocks off the plot.  I appreciated the originality, but the visual smorgasbord that is The Triplets of Belleville ended up being overwhelming (but not in a good way, more of a `my brain hurts' way).Overall Grade 6 out of 10"
197,The Triplets of Belleville,10,17 February 2004,Stunning,"This film is perhaps the most perfect fusion of traditional cell animation and modern computer animation that I have seen in cinemas to date.  The characters are rich and delightful, each one beautifully stylized and uniquely personified.  The story is highly entertaining and easy to understand due to the sparing use of dialog... if any.  Highly recommended for fans of animation and anyone else."
198,The Triplets of Belleville,10,14 February 2004,AMAZING,"I must start by saying that I do not believe that I possess the words to describe the beauty that is this movie. The visuals are no less than stunning. The detail in each and every character is breathtaking. The motion and sound make for an experience to get lost in. This is not your average animated movie by any stretch of the imagination. The dialogue is minimal, to say the least. The story is touching, and if you pay attention, you will easily follow it as it takes you from A to B to C. As a dog owner, I must say I was also impressed with the dog. At some point, someone involved with this story had a dog, as the dog did everything my dogs do.I encourage everyone to see this movie. But stay through the credits! And not just for the terrific music!"
199,The Triplets of Belleville,10,28 January 2004,Crazy and brilliant,"This is the most entertaining movie I've seen in a long time. I laughed so hard during the opening scene I thought I was going to pee my pants.The art in this movie is ultra stylized, yet certain things are hyper realistic. The sounds, for example, have a rich, organic feel unlike any other animation I've seen. The visual atmosphere is highly immersing as well. In the scene of an old woman brushing her teeth, you can just about feel the post-shower steam wafting into the theater.There are so many other things I could say about this movie, but don't have the time. Overall, I would strongly recommend this film to anyone I know. Of course, you have to like weird, ultra imaginative stories and art (everyone I know). But if you don't like having your brain warped and tickled, and if you can't imagine experimenting with a refrigerator as a musical instrument, or if you are basically just uncomfortable with anything other than a mainstream American blockbuster (preceded by one of those heart-warming ""Football Town"" Coke commercials), perhaps you're better off skipping this one.Tips: 1) Stay until after the credits for a cute little scene. 2) if you are so inclined (which i am only rarely), you might want to have a quick smoke before going into the theater. You'll thank me."
200,The Triplets of Belleville,10,31 January 2004,Vive l'Animation!,"Hand-drawn animation may be faltering while computer animation flourishes, but the old 2D standby is still capable of producing true greatness.  One example of this is ""The Triplets of Belleville.""  Created by Sylvain Chomet of France, it takes us into a strange and wonderful world.  The characters are amazing to behold, to the squat clubfooted Mme. Souza to the identical square-shouldered gangsters.  The opening sequence is especially good, paying tribute to the animation style of the 1920's.  This feature is paired with the short ""Destino,"" born of a collaboration between Walt Disney and Salvador Dali.  The surreal beauty of the short is excellently matched with ""Belleville.""  So, I'd say that even though 3d animation is still a force to be reckoned with today, with gems like ""Belleville,"" don't count 2D animation out!"
201,The Triplets of Belleville,10,31 January 2004,Wow!,"La vérité est dans le vin! Superb animated movie. The music is catchy. The animation is beyond great. What a good way to spend 13$ at the movie. Sylvain Chomet has created a little gem. You gotta love the old lady with the whistle! And Bruno the dog, dreaming again! And New York disguise as Belleville, etc. The Triplettes is pure fun to watch. Enjoy!Out of 100, I gave it 88. That's good for ***½ out of ****.Seen in Toronto, at the AMC Kennedy Commons, on January 31st, 2004."
202,The Triplets of Belleville,10,18 January 2004,"Very Black Surreal Comedy, not Warm as Finding Nemo","The Film is Very Black, that's why it's French! Only some creators of Movies can not use the same Formula over and over like 'Finding Nemo', this has a very different path. This movies wasn't made for money or for how many Children can fit into the cinema. This for Mature, Arty Movie Lovers or likes the 1940's era."
203,The Triplets of Belleville,9,27 January 2004,great drawings!,This is a superb work that combines some computer animation that never really takes over the great hand drawings! One has to see this movie more than once to examine details that are beautifully drawn everywhere. Portuguese grandma goes from France to an imaginary US to save her son. Favorite scene: her chasing the ship in the ocean while in a pedaling boat. Superb music and atmosphere. Great for everyone to watch. I expected something from the grandson but unfortunately he hasn't been given personality. Story could have been more resolved. Nevertheless 9/10
204,The Triplets of Belleville,10,28 December 2003,Charming albeit a bit odd,"Wonderful animation.  Creative storyline, rather strange.  Good for older 8 Plus children.  In fact seems a bit like a child's film.  Very pleasing tale for adults involving a devoted grandmother, dog and her grandson in the tour de France in a way you would not have thought possible."
205,The Triplets of Belleville,10,1 December 2003,Can one be in love with a film?,"""Triplettes"" made me very happy and it's very hard to dissect happiness. It is the most original film of the year. Although there is a plot of sorts: an indomitable French Grandma with a clubfoot and her obese dog try to find her grandson who has been kidnapped from the Tour de France, this is a non-linear movie. Perspectives shift on whims. A pot of boiled tadpoles are transforms into the moon.
The characters are all designed with extraordinary panache. They can express the most insouciant human emotions and melt away to nothing in the next instant. The jokes and are rapid -fire and the wit is delectable.Some art references: Tomi Ungerer, whole schools of sardonic European pre-WWII painters, Cocteau, Botero and the early masters of 20s and 30s cartoons, including early Mickey Mouse and Max Fleischer. The relentless movement of the film is underlined by Django Reinhardt-like, unsentimental hot jazz.There are very few recognizable words of either French or English. The dog has all the ""lines,"" and he's very, very good."
206,The Triplets of Belleville,10,30 November 2003,"Best Animated Movie of 2003 (along with ""Finding Nemo"")","This movie is a pure gem! The only bad thing about it is that it's too short! It has a strange, beautiful, strongly addictive poetry that stays with you for a while after you see it. The characters (Mme Souza, Bruno the dog) move you from the very beginning, the art direction is unbelievable, the music is great. I can't wait to see it again!"
207,The Triplets of Belleville,10,28 November 2003,Truly wonderful and heartwarmingly amusing,"This is one of the best films of recent times ( I include all genres here) . Witty, visually stunning and a great story to boot! I urge you to see this film if you can or buy/rent it when it's released on the home market. You will not be disappointed."
208,The Triplets of Belleville,10,26 November 2003,Wonderful and quirky,"I saw this film without subtitles and it didn't need any. It passes the classic criterion for good storytelling: you don't NEED words. The characters look bizarre and that by itself is refreshing.
Disney itself is faltering because they're retreading the same basic plot over and over again, even taking a classic like Hunchback and forcing it into the Disney mold with dismal results. Chomet's animation and Miyazake are the new vanguard of animation. Miyazake is fearless who he targets his animation to (not necessarily kids; but kids love him anyway) and Chomet makes his characters individuals. Strange, yes, but following their own logic, ultimately sensible people. Pixar has taken the crown from Disney, but aside from their humor and the fact they do computer animation, I don't see much stylistic difference with Pixar and Disney. In fact, their alliance infected Pixar with Disney's sensibility and with each movie they become more like clones, often with the same weaknesses. Chomet brings something very different. He makes his characters melancholic, as if sad because their legs are oversized or their bellies are too big to move conveniently. They aren't the saucer-sized sad-eyed-variety, but the misshapen-to-the-point-of-being-handicapped-variety.  They're long-suffering characters with few words, as if they know actions are more important.
They also seemed determined in whatever they do, heroic or, given their sad air, quixotic, like the grandma with her rescue and the secret agents with their evil work. Despite their weird appearance, this sadness makes them more realistic. Because of their determination, clashes are often about mundane, everyday matters, yet they turn apocalyptic. Also his humor is sly. I like his climax, on how he turned the tables on the bad guys.I wouldn't hesitate to show this to MY kids, give them a break from the usual Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks tasteless pap. This, along with Miyazake, so they learn to care about the earth.I would rate this one, 10/10"
209,The Triplets of Belleville,9,24 November 2003,Eccentric and engaging,"I do hope you get the chance to see this eccentric and engaging film.  I'm not a movie animation freak and the animation was completely different and more interesting to me, than any mainstream ones I've seen. It's charm lies in its gallic setting and ethos. It may seem slower-moving than many mainstream titles, but that just gives time to build the characters and the richness of the settings.  It is full of subtle, gentle humour but never sugary-sweet.  The characters are wonderful -especially the women and the dog, who should get an Oscar!I had read rave reviews over here before I went but wasn't sure if I would like it - I did - it was fantastic - surreal, clever and different."
210,The Triplets of Belleville,8,2 November 2003,great,"Without giving away any details, I have a feeling that this will not be shown in the US. Those who saw it will understand, those who haven't should see it for the not so subtle commentary on a French artist's perception of Americans. I was lucky enough to catch it in Europe and was treated to a visual triumph. Although drawn out at times (some would say too many times), the humor and originality of the film made up for the shortcomings. Mainstream animation in the US seems stale to me and I really wish that animation festivals and screenings would have a bigger presence here. If they do, I hope that ""Triplettes"" is the first one to be shown. I would certainly see it again."
211,The Triplets of Belleville,6,3 October 2003,Aestheticly pleasing and entertaining animation,"A visually pleasing and interesting film, with lots of nods to film classics. The humour is simple and a little slapstic, but there is nothing wrong with that. There are also a lot of very subtle jokes in the artwork that make the whole thing pleasing(Watch for the skull in a puff of cigarette smoke, among others). For those worrying that the film is french, there is hardly a word of french in it and the graphics are easily descriptive enough to tell the story."
212,The Triplets of Belleville,10,27 September 2003,Here is a unique voice,"Yes I know, sometimes you don't go and see a film because it has been recommended too much, but do go and see it, I laughed and laughed, and I was stunned by the fantastic style, the beautiful drawings, though there are some ugly people and an ugly dog in this picture, and I was constantly surprised. . You can tell that this creator is a Jacques Tati fan, the way people are mimicked, and the way sound is used, there is also a small piece from a Tati film used as a prop in this one.  I have given it all the stars I could."
213,The Triplets of Belleville,1,20 February 2004,Horrible Film,"I felt as if I were at a cartoon made for gifted children and I wasn't gifted.  One could sense there was clever social comment in the film--I just couldn't figure out what it was.  It wasn't funny.  Every five minutes I looked at my watch and wanted to get the heck out of there.  If you are a pretentious pseudo-intellectual who can make sense out of the bizzare, this is the film you have been waiting for!  If not, don't waste your time."
214,The Triplets of Belleville,2,3 January 2004,More typical garbage from France,"Like most French made as of late that are not based on the works of Dumas, Hugo, Moliere etc... this film is total and the huundreds of other French films that by the the will of the gods do not make it state side, Les Triplettes de Belleville tries to present the viewer with a number of ""think about this topics"" such as fate, love, devotion etc... however as fine as this sounds, they are presented in the most obvious, simplistic and utterly mundane ways ever, so poor is the exectution of this that a two year old child would be able to fully rationalize and understand these concepts. The story is nothing spectacular either, and is written in typical ambiguously esoteric Amelieish fashion, i.e. I am esoteric to be esoteric, so love me or hate me I dont care, I am french. Personally, I'm utterly sick of these types of films, and can we get off the god damn caricatures, from De Gaulle to Eddie Merckx to similarities between the main character and Goscinnys early works, this has just gotten absurd. But moving onward; and I consider this to be the films last and saving grace, the animation is truly spectacular and unique in every fashion (minus the caricatures and the blatant stabs at the Italians, and Americans, these two nationailites were not portrayed in the kindest, yes some stereotypical french country folk were put in for a quick laugh, but I did not find the constant stabs at the americans and Italians amusing), nonetheless, ohter animations, such as the city, the birds eye views, the disproportion of certain objects to others, etc... etc... was inetersting, but that's about it.Now if you're in a French Film mood, dont waste your money on this, go rent Delicatessen, or Le PLacard, or The Dinner Game, and just say no to ambiguously esoteric french crap.
Cheers,"
215,The Triplets of Belleville,6,26 December 2003,Weird animation,"'Les Triplettes de Belleville' is all about the weird animations. It is not about the story, not about the characters and even not about its humor. The humor, again, is something you will only find in the animations.For some the style of the animation is enough to really like this movie. I can understand that, it something I have never seen before. I also liked that part but I need something more to really completely like a movie. There is some fun in the story but there is a good possibility I could come up with something like that.Whether you will like this movie is completely unpredictable. It is definitely worth watching because it is different in so many ways. So go and see it for a new experience and may be you like it."
216,The Triplets of Belleville,10,14 February 2004,The Triplets of Belleville: 10/10,"It's amazing that a film like The Triplets of Belleville would even be released here in America. Not only is it a foreign film, it's animated, and most of all, it has huge anti-American overtones. They make fun of American movies, they make fun of New York, they make fun of our loose morals, and most of all, they make fun of America's huge obesity problem. Therefore, I'm surprised that the MPAA even let it into the country, what with their censorship masquerading as the MPAA ratings. But I digress. Luckily, it got in here, and is not only nominated for two Oscars, but turns out to be one of the weirdest movies every created, and a spectacular one at that.The original plot has Champion, a lonely boy living in a prison-like house with his grandmother and his dog Bruno. He dreams of racing in the Tour de France, and he does. However, he's kidnapped by the French mafia for reasons known later. It's up to his grandmother, Bruno, and the title characters (who are former stars) to save him.This film is quite possible the most unique film ever to be seen. Not only is the plot original, but so are the visuals. There's a mix of animated characters and some real things in there, and it's all amazing to look at. Although I can barely draw a stick figure, I can imagine that it's a lot easier to draw fat people than skinny people, hence why almost every character is outrageously humongous. Of course, that's also a reference to how fat America is, which I'll get to later. The characters were all oddly drawn, but each had their own distinct personality. Even the dog had its own feelings. The individuality of each separate character was amazing, each had its own flaws and characteristics, and with such a short movie, it was great to see that. To make the movie even more original, there is barely any dialogue in the entire movie. To convey a story like this is amazing.The Triplets of Belleville also has scathing humor. When Champion is taken to Bellevile, a hellish, New York-ish place, there's a Statue of Liberty-type statue that is extremely fat and has a hamburger. The best one is simply a t-shirt that says ""I &#9829; Big"" on it. It also plays on the clichés of American cinema, particularly action movies, where the bad guys never hit the good guys, and anything that can explode will. Sometimes it's good to see things from another's perspective.From the first frame, which is the Belleville triplets singing, you're captivated into this all-to-familiar world of quirkiness and fat people. It's an experience you truly need to see to believe.My rating: 10/10Rated PG-13 for images involving sensuality, violence and crude humor."
217,The Triplets of Belleville,3,13 June 2004,Yick!,"I am so disappointed with this film, I can hardly describe it. I was looking forward to a quaint, fun, nicely animated film with some flavor to it. Alas, it's just pure garbage, and I can't really describe it as anything other. I'm mortified that anyone would recommend this piece, it really has nothing going for it. The animation is worse than 10 year old television cartoons, the plot basically doesn't exist, there is only one song in the whole film and it is both not very good and is never even played full through once, the characters are never fleshed out, the pace seventy thousand times slower than ""plodding"", making the movie seem like it's eight hours long even though it's less than 90 minutes, the jokes aren't funny, lots of scenes that appear to be intended as comedic are sickeningly gross and disgusting, you don't get a sense of evil or villainy from the ""bad guys"", nor a sense of positive effect from the ""good guys"".......... It's just plain out awful."
218,The Triplets of Belleville,5,30 December 2007,"Well done, but insincere","France, the late 1950s. When her grandson, a bicycle rider at the tour de France is kidnapped, Madame Souza, a onetime nightclub singer during the times of Josephine Baker, has to rescue him with the help of the family dog from the hands of some American gangsters. While this (almost silent) animated film shows a good hand at storytelling and is technically proficient, I came out of the theater without liking it much. I wasn't sure why and it would take time to articulate my feelings toward it. Basically, the problem with it is that its nostalgia toward an old France is patently fake: the director wasn't even born during the time the movie takes place. (I found the same phony nostalgia in a much worse film, Amelie). Let's also compare the triplettes with a movie made during the late fifties: Jacques Tati's Mon Oncle. While Tati also laments the passing of old France and the coming of a new aseptic France, his feelings are heartfelt. And he does this with sincere humor, and without falling into the miserabilism of this animated feature."
219,The Triplets of Belleville,7,23 September 2005,What does it need to get information on IMDb??,"I send a comment to IMDb about a scene, where we see the Triplettes house for the first time. When they walk up the stairs, you can see through the door to a toilet. In the toilet you can see the leavings - and they have the shape of Mickey Mouse. I send it to IMDb as a trivia, telling them I think its a funny and almost hidden comment in the movie - but they rejected it and wrote that it was obvious to viewers of the film. It's not - have you seen it? In the trivia for the film you can read that ""the film is without words"" - isn't that obvious to??So I just have that feeling that it's not possible to write to IMDb with funny facts about films - but at the same time I think its some of the great things about IMDb - to be able to read strange information about films.Do you have that kind of troubles too?"
220,The Triplets of Belleville,5,18 March 2005,Style Over Substance,"I'm a fan of many French films, in particular Goddard and the Antoine Doniel films. I watched this film with an open mind, and enjoyed the amazing animation that it offered. What it did not offer, however, was a story. I found myself at times watching animation that, if there had been a good story tied to it, I would have been enthralled. However, I just found myself asking ""what purpose does this serve?"" The lack of dialog really hurt the film, in my opinion. There are many silent films and dialog-free films that use the lack of dialog to their advantage. With this film, however, it felt like the filmmaker forgot to include dialog, instead of cleverly omitting it.There are some people who will look at the film's strangeness, ""frenchness"", awards, and animation, and say that it is great. I can't help seeing the flaws, and feeling unexcited after watching it. I would love to see a movie like this again, but with a much better story attached to the great animation."
221,The Triplets of Belleville,,10 August 2004,Racist Caricatures?,"I enjoyed a lot of this feature, particularly the expressive and stylish motion of the characters. I found many images and ideas quite beautiful. Nevertheless, I was a little disturbed by a faint undercurrent of xenophobia. I remember one criticism of Amelie when it first came out being that it came off as a bit fascist, given that a lot of it seems to aspire to portray an essence of French or Parisian identity, but that its world is totally purged of any people of color, in sharp contrast to modern France. Does ""Triplettes"" have a similar flavor? The one black character in is a slightly bug-eyed mostly-naked African woman in the opening cabaret sequence doing tricks with her breasts. I didn't know what to think: on the one hand, her portrayal didn't seem that out of place in a film full of bodily distortions. On the other hand, that particular portrayal has a pretty sick history of dehumanizing images that accompanied inhuman treatment in the U.S. I guess it would be fair for Chomet not to know that much about U.S. history. But wouldn't a vague awareness be appropriate given the level of reactionary racism brewing in France with Jean-Marie Le Pen gaining so much support? I'm also not sure how much I trust Chomet - in one of the special features on the DVD, he was demonstrating character development with a pencil and sketchpad. He drew a thick-lipped, basketball-dribbling man who I guess was supposed to be an African-American. He then talked about how the Triplettes themselves were modeled after ""African"" people, who he said have a special way of moving. He kept talking about ""African"" people, but stopped himself at one point and said ""or, you know, like an American black guy."" Despite being drawn as exaggerated caricatures, some of the white characters in his film grew and acquired a little depth over time. I can't help but wonder if he might just have a two-dimensional view in life of all black people, of no matter what nationality. I'm interested in hearing other reactions."
222,The Triplets of Belleville,10,12 March 2004,grrrreat!,"an excellent film. the triplets of belleville is a wonderful movie...yes...yes it is. it's not a lie...it's not a trick...it's a fine french cartoon. i highly suggest going to see it!! i saw this movie tonight, and in case anyone looks at this, i will highly recommend it. the animation is really awesome, and there is hardly any talking in the movie. it kept my attention the whole time, and i was pretty worried that with no talking at all that it was going to get boring..but that isn't the case at all. the funniest thing about this movie is the fact that it blatently makes fun of american obesity. it's very clever...so see it! :)"
223,The Triplets of Belleville,,7 March 2004,Pretty racist but otherwise great,"Although Les triplettes de Belleville is extremely well-made andenjoyable, I couldn't help finding it too stereotypical and almostracist.  There are a lot of cultural references and winks that arefunny (Mabassine, Dupond et Dupont, etc.) but most of the humoris pretty much poking fun at other cultures.  To begin with themonkeys jumping on Josephine Baker. But it hits it target the mostwhen France is reduced to frogs, wine, and the tour de France,and the US is reduced to obesity and hamburgers (but I somehowfelt it was harsher towards France). This did not prevent me fromenjoying the movie, because it is really well-made, yet I wasuncomfortable about the stereotypes.  I find this especiallydisappointing because Canada claims itself to be so tolerant, butit really acts the opposite way."
224,The Triplets of Belleville,10,1 March 2004,In Dreams,"Only pretentious film critics use words like ""wonderful,"" and ""fabulous."" And I may be guilty of it, myself.  But in this case-- I can think of no other words.The PICTURES tell the story.  No dialogue, but the universal concept of images, like in dreams.  And the story is so simple... nothing to explain, nothing to debate about.  This happens, that happens, and then that happens. It's charming, it's witty, and it's musical.  It's a silent film of the 21st century, showing what IS important to a truly great film, and leaving out what is not.Not the kind of thing that rakes in beaucoup-bucks at the U.S. box office, but it's CLEVER, it's ORIGINAL... and it's touching.So I guess I know some other words after all."
225,The Triplets of Belleville,9,13 February 2004,"Out of the way, Nemo","No matter what the Academy has to say, this movie beats the crap out of Nemo. Despite a few glaring physics problems, such as a car rolling down a hill Slinkey style, this movie was amazing. More amazing still is it's ability to convey American stereotypes without being too offensive, and at the same time, pointing out problems with the french society as well. A good indicator that this film is good: America hates France. This movie makes fun of America. It gets nominated for the American Oscars. I mean, come on, its gotta be good."
226,The Triplets of Belleville,10,1 February 2004,Delightfully Different,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS I have seen a great deal of films in the past year but there are few  that could rival my enjoyment of 'Bellville Rendezvous'.The images are a joy to behold and more than make the film worth watching on their own. Inparticular the stick legged dog Bruno and the square-shouldered mafia henchmen are marvellous creations. This film is also evidence that a film does not necessarily need dialogue for characterization and for the audience to become involved with them.It is not just the visuals though. The title song will leave you humming it for hours on end. I am sure that the plot will seem to some people weak and tedious but there is more intelligence in the plot here then any Matrix sequel you show me. It is exactly how far-fetched the animation, plot and characters are that sets this film apart and how character traits that are so simple but funny to begin with that prove significant in the final chase. Madame Souza's mismatched feet is just one example of this.But possibly the greatest moment in this masterpiece is when the mafia henchmen leave their inferior bosses to be blown up at the start of the escape. So many villains in films escape to safety by the fact their henchmen nobodies sacrifice their lives. But by the henchmen putting their own safety before their boss's and leaving them to die is just what these people would do in reality. It is a true reflection of human nature.So maybe it isn't so far-fetched after all. Genius"
227,The Triplets of Belleville,10,13 October 2003,what a movie...,"Really a great experience, a story that run from the country to the biggest cities, through the mountains and the ocean, with a very little use of the word. The paintings (because every frame is a painting) are simply astounding, and the characters are unique. Please take time to spent on this movie, and possibly more than a vision."
228,The Triplets of Belleville,10,15 September 2003,An astonishing Franco-Weirdo journey,"Please be aware, no amount of description can describe theweirdness or wonderfullness of Belleville Rendevous. You simplyhave to go and see it and experience what must be the mostremarkable animated film of the year (even including 'SpiritedAway'). The different animation styles are blended togetherseamlessly and the whole feature is powered by a uniquelyFrench visual style. It's very, very rare that one goes to the cinema and is literally leftspeechless by what one is seeing. However, I can honestly saythat one scene in Belleville Rendevous achieved this. One actuallyhas the sense - so, so rare in contemporary cinema - of notknowing what is going to happen next."
229,The Triplets of Belleville,4,8 October 2010,Great music but a rather poor story line.,"The music is great and certain parts are wonderful such as the characters of the Grandmother and dog. Unfortunately the other characters are poorly developed. The storyline is also rather dark and to be quite honest rather pointless. The kidnapped racers are not developed as characters and come off as rather simple people who accept being victims. Some reviewers have commented on this film being an antidote to the Pixar films that now dominate. I think that is nonsense. This film has great music and the old style animation is charming but that is not an excuse for such a negative story line and creating a child character who becomes an adult but appears to be, quite honestly, a moron. My sympathy to the grandmother but not to the film or filmmakers."
230,The Triplets of Belleville,,30 December 2003,Interesting and different but not as great as the hype makes it out to be,"Madame Souza raises her son to become a top cyclist with his eyes of the Tour De France.  On a small race, she is following her son in the medical wagon at the very rear of the race when she and the medic find several abandoned cycles without riders - including her son's.  Seeing a mysterious wagon boarding a ship, Madame Souza and her dog Bruno give chase to the big city.  They enlist the help of an aged musical troupe called the Belleville Sisters and uncover a sinister game of death for rich criminals.Different can quite often mean innovative, cutting edge and so on. Sometimes it can just mean different - not better or worse than the norm. This film is very different and is a little better for being quirky and not the usual sort of thing I'd see when I go to the cinema to watch animation. Some reviews on this page have (no offence) gone done the road of `it's different, it's European, therefore it's great - take that Disney!'  Some reviews have given good reasons for their opinions but it is easy to fall into this trap.For me, the quirkiness of the film in terms of content and animation was a plus, although it didn't deliberately jump up and down and cry `look at me, I'm different' or wear it too much on it's sleeve.  The animation is quite funny - like an exaggerated version of reality, and it works pretty well. The plot is good despite the fact that there was very little in the way of dialogue (in fact none that I understood since what little there was, was in French).  The plot managed to have a dark edge to it whilst still keeping a silly sense of humour at points as well.Even if I didn't totally understand all the characters, they were all quite interesting.  The sisters of the title were not that good and their whole concept was lost on me.  However the central two characters of Madame Souza and her dog were pretty good and it was them that I went along with.  The bad guy caricatures were funny and well animated and they were OK for a cartoon.Overall this is very different from animation that I have seen recently. The plot is OK but it does struggle at times, even though the running time is pretty short.  The start and the end are strongest with the middle bit with the sisters not really gripping me at all.  However the film is amusing in a quirky way and is worth seeing."
231,The Triplets of Belleville,1,1 June 2008,Not worth any amount of time or money,"This was possibly the stupidest film/movie I have ever seen in my life for several reasons. This movie, yes ""academy awards winning"" as it may be, doesn't mean it's actually a good film. The animation was horrible, the plot was horrific, and everything else was as retarded as can be. Someone compared the music to Andrew Llotd Webber??????? I do not think so. Andrew Lloyd Webber is pure genius and his songs are absolutely astonishing. The music in this movie was awful. I have never before in my life seen a worse film. If you are thinking about watching this movie, DO NOT unless you are brain dead or stupid. That's the only way anyone could ever enjoy this movie ever. I say that with great risks because my best friend, my other friend, and my best friends mother love this movie. But that is still true. I love stupid humor and such, but this wasn't even good humor. DON'T WATSE YOUR TIME!!!!"
232,The Triplets of Belleville,5,24 November 2003,It is SLOOOW,"It is sooo slow, you'll wonder how you can reach the end. The idea would have been good with a teeeeny bit of rhythm. All the coups de theatre that you may find are wasted, since there is virtually no screenplay. This seems to be the biggest problem for people outside Disney (or Dreamworks). They have ideas, but do not know how to tell stories. Last but not least: the graphics. Weird is good, but if you go too far it becomes weird for weird's sake. Disappointing."
233,The Triplets of Belleville,3,29 April 2006,"Cartoon narrates Grandmere's efforts to rescue her beloved bicycliste, with the help of an aged singing trio and a fat dog.","I don't understand why the ""Triplettes"" received such rave reviews from the critics, and one of the NYTimes top ten for the year. I was disappointed when I finally saw it. Yes, the art work is interesting, but the movie has a depressing subtext on France. Note: Perhaps what follows is a ""spoiler."" But most obviously, first, the frogs the trio catch and eat are ambiguous, especially when you recall that ""frogs"" was slang during the trio's heyday for the French. And the American trio catch and eat the frogs. Second, the Tour de France is the country's greatest sport, but its athletes are depicted as not just dedicated but automatons with no initiative. All the initiative is Mme. Souza, and her creator says that ""Souza"" and/or the character are inspired by a Portuguese--not a French grandmere. Third, the opening depictions of the black dancer, probably after Josephine Baker, are insulting. No one in the US would ever make such a cartoon of black people. Fourth, using the dog as a wheel on Mme. Souza's van would have US animal lovers in an uproar. I would not recommend this cartoon to anyone, and least of all to children."
234,The Triplets of Belleville,4,21 June 2004,Wildly Overrated,"I fully expected to like this movie and was even prepared for a languorous French affair that would take its time in revealing its nuances. Unfortunately, this bleak, uninteresting, and mostly derivative film languishes in an uninteresting/silly plot with ridiculous and simultaneously non-existent character development topped off with a fully boring somehow-required car chase scene that builds upon every trite cliche ever put to film.  The few charming Gaulic moments are far, far outweighed by ponderous pacing and taking-up-time in-jokes (like the dog barking at the train and the grandmother and her horn honking).  So, what is there to recommend in this movie? -- Perhaps the opening sequence with the Triplets doing their Rendezvous number.  After that, I suggest you yank out the DVD and start another movie."
235,The Triplets of Belleville,1,19 August 2011,Awful. A total train wreck that is both a waste of time and money.,"Hate is a strong word yet it applies here as I did hate this film. It was rather boring and just pointless. Anyone who says the animation was top notch and better than most Disney or Pixar stuff is on something. The first part of the movie is done in B&W which looks like something out of a 1940's Merry Melodies cartoon, the rest of the movie is done in color and looks a lot like the animation from the Beatles animated movie ""Yellow Submarine"" with scenery and characters all drawn in weird surreal type images. I found this type of animation to be out of place and really ugly ,not in a bizarre way, just in a cheap way.My other reasons for hating it are virtually no dialog which to some consider that an art form ,sure if you watch an old silent movie but not for a modern work, The characters are all portrayed in caricature or parody too. Americans are all drawn to be obese , Europeans are thin, guys who ride bikes have freakishly large leg muscles etc. I mean can we say contrived here.The Triplets start off as 3 young women singing in the 1920's or 30's , later in the movie they are shown in the present time as 3 old hags who eat frogs and cackle. Their involvement in this really long and drawn out plot of a Tour De France biker getting kidnapped is purely by coincidence. The grandmother blows a whistle incessantly throughout the movie and the Triplets try to sing ,rather badly of course. It's just a train wreck of a movie. Definitely not for kids or for that matter for anyone with decent taste. I'm sorry but I did not find it to be this masterpiece of an art form. If anything it comes across as one long boring bland waste of time and film. Paying 8 dollars for this is a tragedy."
236,The Triplets of Belleville,7,19 February 2009,Belleville Rendez-Vous,"I had heard a lot about this French cartoon, and I identified the Grandma character with it, so when the opportunity came, I wasn't going to miss it. Basically an orphan boy named Champion is kidnapped while cycling in the Tour De France by two sinister mafia gangsters, to be taken across the Atlantic to Belleville. It is up to his club-footed Grandmother, Madame Souza, with her lazy and pudgy dog Bruno, to rescue him. Soon after arriving in Belleville herself, she meets three performing Triplets (named in the alternative film title, The Triplets of Belleville), who not only form a bizarre jazz combo with her included, but help her to rescue Champion from the clutches of the mob. The highlights of the film are the ocean crossing with classic score, the disgusting frog dinner (I'm guessing a mock on one of the French's signature foods), and the jazzy music sequences with the batty Triplets. The unusual and stylised animation is not only what makes the film very watchable and charming, but it also adds to the film's dark side, the slapstick and throwaway gags are great too. It was number 76 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!"
237,The Triplets of Belleville,7,15 November 2008,The Tripets of Belleville (2003),"The Triplets of Belleville is just as wonderfully bizarre as anything I've seen from Miyazaki. From a visual standpoint, this film is a success. Any scene involving the triplets themselves was inventive and interesting to watch. Also, I was particularly struck by the use of repetition and metronomic rhythm in this film; in most instances it is used to represent the passage of time or a feeling of anxiety the characters themselves are feeling. I, too, was feeling anxious after hearing that clock on the wall for ten minutes. Very effective artistic elements here.However, the plot tends to be paper thin. I was left with the feeling that the plot could have come out of a Cartoon Network half-hour serial. This is actually a common issue I see in animation. It isn't detrimental in an extreme way, as the visuals and emotions conveyed do hold this film up, but I must admit they can't entirely conceal the other elements of the film which may be lacking.It was a pleasure to watch, as are those films I've just mentioned, but still doesn't have substance and depth in order to satisfy me completely as Pixar, Miyazaki, or other animation studio's films tend to do.7/10"
238,The Triplets of Belleville,,23 September 2008,"heartwarming, surreal and possibly one the greatest animated films of our time","at the 2003 academy awards pixar won it's first Oscar for the animated feature finding nemo, don't get me wrong nemo was a great animated film but the triplets of Belleville is beyond the cgi animation formula on so many levels. the film starts out introducing us to us to the triplets of Belleville three musical woman in a satire of classic black and white animation performing their famous musical number "" Belleville rendezvous"" their performance then turns out to be a TV program, the film then centers on an odd old woman named madame souza and her grandson champion. champion is extremely unhappy even his dog Bruno can't cheer him up until his grandma buys him a bicycle, years later madame souza trains champion to compete in the tour De France. one day when champion is racing in the tour De France he and two other cyclists are kidnapped by the french mafia, once souza realizes champion has been kidnapped she and Bruno travel all the way to Belleville ( a satire of new york city) to find champion there they meet the triplets of Belleville who help them to find champion. as you might notice the plot is frankly odd as with the film's spectacular animation and memorable characters. the animation in the film might be disturbing to some viewers, keep in mind this film is not for children as it even surpasses the artwork of Tim Burton himself. each character from Bruno the dog to the french godfather is so uniquely drawn so that every second of this film is new treat for you. one of the most memorable aspect of the film is the music the characters in the film make beautiful sound with news papers, refrigerators vacuum cleaners and more. when i first saw the film I fell in love with it, it's extremely hard to explain what great piece of art this isI highly recommend this beautifully surreal, heartwarmingly odd and to some might call slightly dark to every anime fan, noir lover and those who are just seeking a great animated film to this p.s. just to warn you there is barely any dialouge at all"
239,The Triplets of Belleville,10,10 September 2008,"Demented, Bizarre, You have NEVER seen a film like this!!!","HUGE fan of French Cabaret music here! So when I hear the Triplets of Belleville song performed at the Academy Awards, I know I HAVE to check this out.French independent film... does it get any better than this? NO speaking...or very little, to say the least, which gives the film a very eerie dimension.Don't let the fact that this film is animated throw you. Kids should NOT see this. Not giving anything away, but it IS spooky--if nothing else, the ""thematic"" material might throw a ""young whippersnapper"" off.I rented it a million times and showed it to all my friends during junior and senior year. Have yet to show it to a person who didn't end up falling in love with it as I have.Very strange. Very quirky. I'm not the sort of person to go all out and buy DVDs, but this one is a keeper. If anything, because it's not the obvious American blockbuster, and I have no idea how long a film like this is going to be accessible to us."
240,The Triplets of Belleville,10,25 May 2008,Amazingly questioning...,"I'm very fond of animation movies, being Disney, Ghibli, Pixar, Dreamworks, Aardman or any other good studio.I just watched the Triplets of Belleville and my feeling now is WOW! How could I ignore this one for so long?My problem is: I don't understand exactly why... The characters are ugly and almost disgusting, there is barely any dialog and the two main characters are an old stubborn little woman... and her fat dog! No sexy girl, no stunning special effect (OK a few CGI to animate the sea and a few vehicles), no strong, clever or invincible hero... so what!?Could be because the movie is so rich... in every sense of the term! The whole idea is so incredibly creative, the music, the atmosphere, the monomaniac characters, the repulsive AND charming triplets...All that doesn't make sense... But you CAN'T possibly be untouched by that movie!!!I'll watch it again soon..."
241,The Triplets of Belleville,10,7 May 2008,its so good I thought i was dreaming,when you get the first sight of the imaginative city Belleville you just say wow because words can't describe what you have seen.The characters are so funny and stereotypical like the main characters grandmother who is easily the most caring and expressive person even tough she doesn't talk. the mafia are so funny how spot on they are and the car chase is easily the best one in movie history.the plot is simple and sweet the details are so good it will take you some time before you notice it.I can't just help mentioning that massive dog who barks at trains every time they go past.I love the mood its a type of jazzy feel to it with some amazing musical scores like at the restaurant or the start the music stays with you for a long time if you like something original and well made you will like this but i understand many people wont like this but i think its the best film ever in my opinion
242,The Triplets of Belleville,7,2 December 2006,"THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE (Sylvain Chomet, 2003) ***","This unexpected and highly-acclaimed piece of animation is sufficiently different in style and design to make a good impression but the overall effect is hindered by a dreary plot (competitors in the Tour De France are being abducted by the underworld and forced to take part in clandestine races) and some sagging spots in the script. The main characters, especially the resourceful grandmother, her overgrown dog and the frog-eating titular characters themselves, however, more than make up for these flaws; having said that, the best part of the film are the black-and-white prologue (featuring the sisters' bouncy Oscar-nominated number and a clever Fred Astaire caricature) and the exuberant theater finale capped by a car chase in which our victorious heroes are pursued by a horde of homogeneous henchmen."
243,The Triplets of Belleville,10,25 July 2005,Eees eet over now?  I hope not.,"Well - it's been a long time since I last saw something this good. Fabulous and original animation from some seriously strange European minds. Hauntingly beautiful and very funny - Triplets is like nothing you will have seen before. The story is told almost exclusively with facial expressions, sound and location. Underpinning the whole is a wonderful score from the Elfman - with a bizarre rhythmic complexity that fits the stylized animation perfectly.There's a lot of imagery and movement that gets under your skin - and stays there. The horse noises that the cyclists make I found particularly arresting.....and the way Grandma pushes here specs back on all the time...or the whistle, or the Triplets long gangly arms.....Magic!"
244,The Triplets of Belleville,8,7 July 2005,It's strange but it's good...,"I watched this about a week ago and I then couldn't help myself on writing a review on it.A friend recommended it to me and though I wasn't sure I'd like it I decided I would give it a try.Boy was I surprised.Now I don't usually like animation films but this one was very good and I'm surprised that a few people were disappointed by it.Although there is hardly any talking in it they still managed to pull it off.The animation was very creative and original,the story line was simple but good,and the music by Benoi't Charest was perfect for the movie.This animation BEAT PIXAR by a mile.Give it a try.You might love it.I'ts not perfect but it's very enjoyable.8.2/10"
245,The Triplets of Belleville,7,22 February 2005,Irreverent and amusing French animated feature,"You don't see too many animated films come out of France (you just don't!) but after viewing this strange and original farce you'll come away thinking that maybe they should start thinking seriously about making more. Story is (loosely) about Madame Souza who along with her faithful dog Bruno try to find her grandson who disappears while racing in the Tour de France.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Madame Souza and Bruno eventually become broke during their search but one night they meet the Belleville Triplets who used to be a popular music trio and they take the two in and feed them frogs! With the help of Bruno and his nose they discover that Souza's grandson has been kidnapped by the French mafia and is being used for illegal gambling which entails riding a bicycle.This is directed by Sylvain Chomet who creates an animated film that's chock full of odd scenarios and characters that have to be seen to be believed. Chomet's vision seems to be very nostalgic as we see characters resembling Fred Astaire and Josephine Baker but it's also very musical and there's a scene where the triplets and Madame Souza do a number with nothing but a vacuum cleaner, a refrigerator, a bicycle rim, and a newspaper. With the triplets eating nothing but frogs, Souza and her whistle, and a mafia boss who can barely see over a table Chomet seems like a cross between Terry Gilliam and Ralph Bakshi. Unlike most animated films that try to be mainstream friendly this quiet but utterly unique effort is a visual surprise that shows Chomet as a filmmaker with an incredible eye for esoteric details and I can't think of a better compliment than to say that the most normal character appearing in this film is Bruno the dog."
246,The Triplets of Belleville,10,30 January 2005,An unexpected best animated film amidst the popularity of Japanese anime and CGI animation,"I think this deserves the Oscar trophy better on the Best Animated Feature nomination...well Nemo had it though. This is what i believed as a best contender for popular cartoon movies nowadays amidst the popularity of Japanese anime and Pixar/Dreamworks' CGI toon movies.I hadn't had a good watch again of these type of cartoons other than those Madeline series or those old Sesame Street toon shorts, and this movie had me curious finding it on video...and i was amazed by the old-fashioned style of background drawings, characters, musicals, even the simple plot. Yes, very caricaturish and unrealistic...but that's what cartoons are all about, simply enjoyable for kids and parents alike. Simple, just like watching either Rugrats or Madeline, not much realistic in design. Just a cartoon. There had been an evolution of cartoon enjoyment nowadays, but with this movie, you will feel the same old fun of watching those learning animation features were all about.A must see movie/animated film. Stands true and deserves to being critically acclaimed."
247,The Triplets of Belleville,9,7 January 2005,Goes beyond the boundaries and limitations of language,"To think that I almost missed watching this wonderful movie because it has no close-captioning! But it doesn't need subtitles nor captioning to convey all the emotions of the characters, including Bruno the dog. The animators go beyond the boundaries and limitations of language, making this film truly universally understood by anyone. My absolute favorite was Bruno the dog! What a dog! His eyebrows are so expressive that you know exactly what he is feeling and wanting during the film. His dreams are in glorious canine black and white with themes that revolve around food, his master Champion, and the trains that go by on schedule - and at which Bruno loves to bark at on schedule. The grandmother is the epitome of grandmotherly-love and her huge thick glasses and one short leg do not stand in the way of her seeking to get her beloved grandson Champion back from the kidnappers. The triplets are great wacky characters, eccentric and brave. This animated film is going to stand well in the ""test of time""!"
248,The Triplets of Belleville,9,3 January 2005,Unique and Strange,"This is the weirdest animated film I have ever seen! The beginning of the film prepares you for the strangeness of the movie. At the beginning it opens up black and white with the Triplettes de Belleville singing when they were younger. All these really fat ladies, I mean really obese, come to the show in their limos, and with them they have their husbands or boyfriends. These men are tiny and are being drug by these women. One of these women gets out of the limo by herself and your wondering why she is by herself, and as she is walking in you see that she does have a man, and he is stuck between her butt cheeks. Yeah that's right, that's just a taste of how weird it is.There is no talking between the main characters in the movie. Any talking that does take place is on a TV screen or radio, and that is all in French. This is very effective though because the characters have lots of emotion in how there were drawn, and you can still follow the movie without any trouble.The animation is superb. Everything is drawn so well. Each character is unique and they have a certain feeling to them. All the characters are somewhat exaggerated. They are really fat, skinny, over muscular, or square. This gives some neat humor to it. I like the colors they used to. It was sort of dark, it wasn't overly bright.Unlike many new animated films today, this one is original. I've never seen anything like it. It's not your typical prince saves princess, or animal saves an animal. This animated movie has its own different story.The last thing that I LOVED about it was the music. I loved the opening song that the Triplettes sing. The music throughout it is cool.This is one animated film that will leave you with your jaw hanging open, and you'll be thinking, ""what the heck just happened?"""
249,The Triplets of Belleville,9,2 January 2005,"Enjoyable, but Depressing","Though I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I found it somewhat depressing from the start (I watched this twice within one week). First, there is the fact that Mme. Souza cannot get Champion to talk to her. And she tries so hard to make him happy. Then the house gets pushed aside for progress, which seemed highly unnecessary, they could have built to the side of it. I think the most depressing part was that when Champion finally does speak to his grandmother, she is no longer a part of his life (the end, when he is old. The likelihood of her being alive is just about nil).But I found her character refreshing and funny, from her lazy eye to her short leg.And since the video didn't rely on voices to advance the movie, I enjoyed the sound effects and the music.And as a comment about the frogs and the triplets, I got the impression that they were from France, especially the singing french in an American theater. (btw, my sister's french speaking professor said that most of the french in this movie was gibberish, anyone agree?)"
250,The Triplets of Belleville,10,18 December 2004,Jaw-Droppingly brilliant,"French, no (intelligible) dialog, no subtitles, silly plot. A lame but indefatigable and unflappable grandmother with amblyopia searches for something that will capture the interest of her orphaned grandson. She tries music, a dog, a model train - and finally scores with a tricycle. (The train scores with the dog.)Years later, the boy (and the grandmother and the dog) are training for the Tour de France. He's kidnapped by mobsters to participate in a racing/gambling racket. Grandmother, dog, and some elderly ex-music hall singers save the day.Absolutely astoundingly original characterizations. Mix in some Bach, Josephine Baker, stereotypically mincing head waiter, ""men in black,"" rodent-like technician and a mob boss - not to mention the frogs.... I'm still trying to catch my breath. (Did I mention the obese statue of liberty with the ice cream cone?)"
251,The Triplets of Belleville,9,8 November 2004,Wonderfully unique!,"This is a fantastic little animated movie. The film is so wonderfully French and at the same time so universal and the quirkiness of it is so engaging. What makes it great is firstly the superb animation. It's a mixture of good old fashioned hand drawn stuff and computer work. The drawing of the characters is particularly good with each person extremely exaggerated. The cyclist has enormous and muscular calves while his upper body and face is gaunt. Then there is the fat dog, whose enormous body is perched upon four tiny limbs. All the characters are wonderfully unique and have certain character traits. I just love the animations in this, the characters become extremely likable on an aesthetic level. The film despite its French-ness has no dialogue in it and is entirely told visually and by non-dialogue audio which makes it so enjoyable. It has a great atmosphere because of the animation and the music and the real subtle humour. The dog is particularly funny.Another part that makes the animation great is the way the backdrops are drawn. The film has a really glorious sense of cinematography and the way the lighting of the sets are drawn on is quite wonderful and unlike any other animated film I have seen. The film really does look great. The score is excellent and really gives that great sense of France and gives the film much of its atmosphere.Overall this is a great movie. It's unique and extremely enjoyable. It's a visual feast and a funny little gem of a film. ****"
252,The Triplets of Belleville,9,5 October 2004,Silent films are back in style!,"I was initially drawn to the movie (pardon the bad pun) by the rather interesting looking artwork. I was expecting a high action story with a cyclist thievery plot and shady mob-goings on. But I was in for quite a surprise. Some people may find the movie's pace boring. I thought it was great, but some people may not take kindly to the almost complete lack of dialogue and absence of big action sequences. It is a slow-paced movie that ambles its way along, enthralling us at each new turn of the story. There are many genuinely funny moments, and the music is lots of fun. (I found myself singing the title song days after I returned my rented copy to the video store.) Madame Souza and Bruno are adorable, the big square French mobsters are great, and the crazy waiter is a riot! And you'll never look at a frog the same way again after...well, I won't spoil it for you by telling. Go see it yourself. And be sure to pay careful attention at the opening of the film to spot Django Reinhart, Josephine Baker, and Fred Astaire in animated cameos! (Of course, it figures that a French moviemaker would put a French jazz musician in the open!)"
253,The Triplets of Belleville,,11 September 2004,Rivalry,"My childhood and teen days were immersed in Japanese and American manga and animations therefore, this French production to me though fresh, not of tremendous attraction. Europe in the eyes of the French people is entirely different from that of the Japanese, they have their own features and style.However, I still pick the Japanese ones because the colour used is brighter and more convivial. Who is the current market winner? I guess it should be the Japanese, still. I hope the Europeans would explore this area more thoroughly.What kept me watching from the beginning till the end is the perseverance of Madame Souza. I wish I could have such a granny but I don't want her to rescue me at such senior age. The Mr. Bean-like dialogue (which also means no dialogue) is something interesting. It makes me think if Europeans are able to write dialogue line in lighter entertainment shows. To sum up, it's a warm and lovely story."
254,The Triplets of Belleville,,24 August 2004,Sylvain Chomet's ¡§The Triplets of Belleville¡¨ is the best animated movie I've seen this year.,"The movie is about a grandmother who always dreamed of biking, and is living with her little chubby grandson in a house in France. The boy (no name) was very bored. One day Grandma bought him a puppy!! Then the puppy and the boy were both equally bored. One day Grandma bought them a toy train!! The boy was watching the electronic toy run around the circular track, and Bruno, the puppy, had his tail run over. He was really p***ed at the train. As time passed, Grandma wanted the boy to get into cycling. From chubby to skinny with huge-ass leg muscles, the boy was preparing to compete in the Tour De France. The puppy, from skinny to hella fat, was still barking at trains that passed by on the bridge pushing against the French family¡¦s tall house. Through tough training, the boy became a fit cyclist. While competing in the Tour de France, the boy was kidnapped along with two other competitors by the French Mafia. They were taken in a van, which went onto a ship, and went across the sea to New York. This exciting comedy shows how a determined grandmother, accompanied by her dog and the ¡§Triplets¡¨ fight the Mafia in order to rescue the kidnapped boys. Sylvain Chomet's ¡§The Triplets of Belleville¡¨ is the best animated movie I've seen this year. Many people say that it is an adult animated film, but what they really mean is that little kids might not enjoy it as much. The filming is good, the old ¡§Looney Tunes¡¨ style in black and white in the beginning, then a uniquely drawn touch throughout the rest. The characters are very cute and interesting. There is not much dialogue at all in the whole 80 minutes, so anyone who doesn't know French can still fully enjoy this movie without subtitles. 7.5/10"
255,The Triplets of Belleville,,28 July 2004,Superb animation,"'Belleville Rendez-Vous' was one of those animation that comes along once in a while. The opening cabaret sequence that sent up Disney animation and cabaret shows at the time set the tone for what we could tell was going to be a high class animation.The story line is pretty simple really, grandson is kidnapped by the French mafia during the mountain stage of the tour de france, and grand-ma goes looking for him and meets the eccentric Belleville triplets.There is very little dialouge (in fact, only about one or two instances of it), and I'm glad of that. You certainly don't need dialouge, the animation told it's own story. The characters were brilliant exaggerations of real life, and easily recongisable. Absolutely amazing and adorable."
256,The Triplets of Belleville,,23 July 2004,Embarrassingly bad!,"I can't even begin to describe how boring this movie was.....I literally couldn't wait for it to end, 78 minutes felt like a lifetime. I bought this movie due to the rave reviews, bigged it up to my wife and 2 kids, and then had to sit embarrassed for the final 68 minutes after trying for the first 10 to keep the interest levels up with comments such as ""it'll get better soon"", ""it's just building the plot and characters"" - neither of which happened!And, before you think it, my family are quite ""well-read"" when it comes to animation - my kids love all of Miyazaki's work, so it's not like we are Disney-freaks.The animation is quirky and interesting but that can only carry your interest for a short time, it basically lacks a good storyline or ANY interesting characters.....except maybe the dog (and I am being nice there!). I hoped and prayed for a good plot twist at the end or some really funny/clever/interesting reason why the champion had been kidnapped - I got nothing.Sorry to be so negative about this film but if I hadn't heard so much about it then I would have just shelved it as ""something different, not my taste but hey each to his own"".....but the pretentious clap-trap and hype that surrounded this movie raised my expectations to Princess Mononoke levels then dropped them crashing onto the rocks.Rubbish."
257,The Triplets of Belleville,10,18 June 2004,brilliant,"this is brilliant from start to finish. the soundtrack is great and adds even more depth to this very unique animated film. truly a must for anyone that is hesitant. you will be pleasantly surprised. in the area where i live there were no previews or trailers for the film. i had no idea what the movie was about. i only remember reading somewhere that roger ebert, from the chicago sun times, enjoyed the film. i skipped going to the movie theater to see it, chicken i guess. didn't want to be out $8 bucks for some french cartoon that may or may not be in English. well, i will just say that i should have taken the chance. i would have loved to have heard the soundtrack on the dolby digital in the movie theater. so, to any skeptics, give it a shot. :)"
258,The Triplets of Belleville,8,12 June 2004,Great artistic direction... pity about the rest.,"The first thing that hits you with this movie is the top quality animation. Close to Ghibli. Far better than Disney and all that crap. A good show of how 2d and 3d can be used together seamlessly.The second thing that hits you is the attention to detail in the little gags. The oddly proportioned cyclists. Huge ships and skyscrapers. The dog that barks at every train that goes past. The old woman with her whistle. Its not just that the visuals are great, but every scene is put together so well....Unfortunately. The plot leaves something to be desired. Not that it should be a plot focused film. But they could have done better than this. Maybe it could've made a half hour quirky story. But its a bit of a stretch for 80 minutes. Might even be more exciting on the second viewing, picking out all the small quirks than the first time focussing on an unfocused plot.The grandma was the highlight of the characters by far. The cyclists main feature was his physique, and big nose. The dog had a bunch of unconnected dreams, which seemed to lead to nothing. The triplets were just as drab when not actually singing.The music i found was little more than generic and imitative... I'm sure a lot of the musicians pictured at the start would be turning in their graves, if it was at all possible. Still. At least the music didn't feel the need to overblow the whole film, like Hollywood tend to.Watch this film if you are interested in visual and acoustic direction. But all in all, its hardly a masterpiece. 8/10"
259,The Triplets of Belleville,,1 June 2004,Nothing new for Animation Fans,"While this film is a welcome relief to those who accustomed to Pixar and Disney, it is old hat for people familiar with European style animation. 
In light of that, there are a few good gags.  The style of the drawing is interesting, but not interesting enough to rescue a slow, uninteresting plot populated by undimensional characters. The music is a higlight, bouncy and jazzy in places, slow and moody in other places, always well executed and appropriate to the action.People who are unfamiliar with this style of animation will probably be charmed by the film.  I saw nothing novel about it and fell asleep."
260,The Triplets of Belleville,10,24 May 2004,I absolutely loved this movie!,"I absolutely loved this. That catchy tune. The freaky animation. The bizarre relationship between a determined old woman and her mindless piece of muscle bicyclist son who is kidnapped during the Tour de France is fascinating. I always wanted more.There are about a million kinds of animation used in this, and the fact that they don't blend seamlessly ADDS to its charms. I think it just illustrates the genius of this vision.There's almost no dialogue in the film and by the end you wonder how the heck all the information you know was conveyed to you."
261,The Triplets of Belleville,9,17 May 2004,AWESOME-A WORK OF ART,"I watched this wondering if I would really get into it. I sat there for l l/2 hours and can't remember when I laughed so hard, especially at an animated movie. My personal belief, as much as I LOVED   Finding Nemo, this was the   one that deserved the Academy award. Fresh, original,and so much fun. I love the dog and the train bit, it gets funnier every time instead of tiring because the director is a geneous. The style of animation is so fresh from what we normally see. I recommend this movie it is a step off of the ladder   of normal, into a great 1 l/2 hours. If you rent the dvd, the quality is excellent, the sound and score are so well recorded.I also think that this movie had the song of year, but the politics of the Academy are in full swing these days."
262,The Triplets of Belleville,,10 May 2004,Great WIERD movie,"I loved this flick!!  This movie was so surreal that it was not even FUNNY! I loved the way that kid obsessed with riding his bike.  Once he got into the TOUR DE FRANCE, his legs were soooo huge!!  His faithful grandmother was awesome!!  She never gave up hope.  I was amazed how brainwashed the kid became as the movie went on.  I guess that his mind was just mush after biking so much and so often.  Those gangsters had the most SQUARE shoulders I have ever seen.  I was so shocked to see how that little man had so much pull.  Or what about that cool dog that barked at trains??  That DOG was awesome and had the tiniest little legs!!!!The movie ended well and the fact that there was NO dialogue was very interesting!!!"
263,The Triplets of Belleville,10,1 April 2004,A Breath Of Fresh Air,"Les Triplettes des Belleville is heroic poetry. Poetry because of its' sensibility (sentiment), idea and technique. Why heroic? In fact it consists of a sad story(dreams that never come true) - an orphan kid living together with his grandma in the suburbs, in a house that bends like the tower of Pisa,seemingly falling apart. Cripple Grandma knows she is too old to be of real help in her nephew's education, yet she does all her best in encouraging his natural  talents and hobbies.Then it all turns out into the kid's relishable dream  of winning the Tour de France, and the epopee begins: transatlantic trip, new york, musical, mafia, grotesque. A wonderful story of astonishing imagination and black humour. A proof that even in the harshest conditions there is hope. The certainty that love and devotion come back to you with a boomerang effect. Moreover,Chomet has the brilliant idea of melting drawing and music together - the natural language, the most powerful way of expression . Words lose their mystical and mysterious halo through common utterance. Get ready for a feast of colour and song!"
264,The Triplets of Belleville,10,23 March 2004,just let go and enjoy the ride.... Please.,"Too many persons are writing WAYYYYYY too much into this beautifully executed French comedy - - - look first to the type of film and THEN to the style of its execution.  This would be a tremendous [and very FUNNY] story in the hands of any worthy film craftsman, but by crafting this tale in a drawn environment it takes on an ephemeral and surreal quality that defies the passage of time [on screen and off].  It is a reasonably complex tale at some levels that can be reduced to the raw simplicity of the images on the screen or dissected and extrapolated to be `Anti-U.S.' [???] or whatever. You will enjoy the film MUCH more if you simply let go of ANY preconceptions about what you are going to view and let the story and imagery wash over you.  This is a film that cleans the artistic third eye and refreshes your ideas about the detail present on the screen as a reflection of the worth of the story.  If complexity of images was an ironclad guarantee of story quality then the Massive software alone should be enough to guarantee the little gold statues - fortunately this is not the case.  This is a deceptively simple story [although I would recommend avoiding synopsis before viewing] on paper that takes flight through the images and score and the sheer surprising nature of the images placed before you.  In the same fashion that `Delicatessen' is about; 'a butcher who is slowly eating the tenants in his building', that does not begin to tell you about the film and only viewing that work will impress upon you the urgency and poignant nature of the film.  Triplets is a movie you will not soon forget and should catch yourself laughing out loud in sheer delight in both the images and the ideas.  Too bad that these sort of films are often either dismissed or unfairly categorized [often by people who couldn't even name a non-Disney animated feature or tell you who Rene Laloux was.. Sad.].  I will see it at least once more on the large screen and be there the day the DVD goes on sale.  Highly Reccomended & Safe for Older Kidz."
265,The Triplets of Belleville,10,21 March 2004,"A wonderfully quirky, surreal animated celebration of the heroism of indomitable old people!","Triplettes is one of the most unusual and delightful full-length animated films ever done. It is as quirky in its twists and turns as it could be while still holding together as a coherent story. It is archly funny in the way it establishes personalities for each of its characters without their ever saying much of anything; in fact, the film, while full of sound, has very close to no dialogue.It has a dog named Bruno who can tell time and who is, by turns, a truck tire, a tugboat, and a typical dog, barking at trains - but he is also a dog with a recurring dream of trains, including one sequence in which he is the train passenger and people in a window bark at him as he passes by them. It has large-legged bicycle racers with no upper body to speak of. It has an ancient trio of women performers, one of whom gets supper for all of them by using hand grenades. It has French mafiosi who are triple beings of very sinister aspect (physically reminiscent of the famed Knights who say ""NI!"") who kidnap bicycle racers to enslave them.The film has a fabulous rescue sequence and a subsequent chase scene that is very long, very funny and as fully engaging as any chase scene ever filmed.The heroes of the film are Madame Souza, bicycle racer Champion's grandmother and three ancient and lively old women (the triplettes) who were (and still are) vaudeville performers (as is Madame Souza, incidentally, on a well-tuned bicycle wheel). Madame Souza lets nothing get in the way of her mission, that of rescuing the kidnapped Champion - not a lack of clues (she uses Bruno's scenting ability to pick up the trail), not an ocean, not a 20-minute limit on the paddle-boat she rents, not a diet of frogs, not a bunch of really bad guys, not even a fat boy scout.As my wife said: not many films these days so grandly celebrate older people, not even animated old people.Oh - and the music in the film - both the original music and the adapted music - is simply terrific.One of the best films I've seen - a film done with great love and discipline, and with splendid artistry. It will become a classic."
266,The Triplets of Belleville,9,11 March 2004,yummy,"This movie could have gone on for many more hours and I wouldn't have been bothered.  The look and the sensibilities of Les Triplettes de Belleville are simply perfect to me.  It's got the stately-slow comic setups of a Tati film.  It has a proto-industrial look reminiscent of Jeunet and Caro films that spans from the truly monumental to the most trivial detail.  Some of the characters seem like refugees from a Beckett play while others are painted in gleefully unPC broad strokes. If you're the kind of person who revels in the plot of Brazil, plays fx segments of Blade Runner again and again, have a nearly-spent VHS of Delicatessen, love David Lynch still lifes, and have the Nightmare Before Christmas characters dancing in your head, then this movie may really suit your tastes."
267,The Triplets of Belleville,10,3 March 2004,Disney writers could go take lessons...,"The edge to the animation immediately gets your attention and then the charming little story sucks you in. It's also enhanced by one of those scores that you find yourself humming after movie is over. I thought this was one of the best films I saw this year.  I loved the way the story moved along without dialogue.  I appreciated that the filmmakers realized how important it is to get a viewer's imagination involved rather then to so tediously describe--both visually and in dialogue--to death.
Was Belleville supposed to be America?  The fat Statue of Liberty and the overweight citizenry certainly implied that.Disney writers might want to just swallow pride and go do apprenticeships with these guys."
268,The Triplets of Belleville,9,3 March 2004,Most passing strange,"This is a very bizarre visual and aural experience.  One that animation fans will absolutely love.  I was amazed.  In French and a bit of English and no subtitles!  But then, none are necessary.  Sure-handed storytelling transcends any need for translation.  Big-screen animation takes another leap forward with The Triplets of Belleville, which packs staggering levels of craft and imagination into every last frame. By turns tender and pitch-dark, but always sublimely ridiculous, this trés French concoction was the only real competition for Finding Nemo in this year's animated-feature Oscar race.  Belleville is also a resounding call to shovel that dirt off the grave of hand-drawn animation. The caricature work is ornate and breathlessly bizarre, as if Fellini had come back from the grave and picked up a pencil. But the style and rhythms  almost no dialogue, lots of sound effects and darkly comic set pieces  are more reminiscent of the French filmmaker Jacques Tati. Belleville has the precision and detail of a Tati film, but it's much stranger and more frenetic. Like most great animated films, it takes full advantage of the format's otherworldly potential. Even if it's not your thing, chances are you've never seen anything like it."
269,The Triplets of Belleville,9,25 February 2004,visually enthralling,"There is no dialogue in this film.  Some might see that as a handicap - but the visual elements turn this non-naturalistic approach into a major plus point.  Characters are moulded into caricatures caroonish even for animation, yet somehow completely plausible.  Some sequences are repeated several times with tiny variations (the dog barking at the train near the beginning).  every figure in the film is animated with equal care, and given a visual personality (the cuboid gangsters and the vase-shaped cyclists are great examples).  the only film i've seen recently with this kind of approach is the animé flick Spirited Away (also highly recommended), but the two films are different in mood.at the bottom line, belleville rendezvous/les triplettes... is a light fantasy, and it isn't by any stretch of the imagination a challenging cinematic experience.  it is, however, charming and in its own way enthralling."
270,The Triplets of Belleville,9,26 February 2004,A new entry in my top ten.,"The ""Triplets of Belleville"" isn't just a good movie. It is a great movie, the kind of great movie that makes you think ""I wish the Hollywood Studios would devote some of their resources to producing this kind of art.""I mentioned the word ""art"", which probably conjures up a lot of images of visually stunning stylistic snooze fests devoid of much beyond their film-making art. This is not that kind of art. Yes, the movie is French, and yes it is visually stunning. But the movie transcends language (there is barely any dialogue in the film and it is better because of it). You could literally drop this film almost anywhere in the world with no translation and viewers would understand the entire story. Whats more, they would be interested in the entire story.The story is simple and moves along at a good clip. The film is short (1 hr 22 min), beautiful, engaging, wonderfully scored, and terrific characters.Don't let the fact that the movie is animated and has a simple storyline fool you into thinking this is a children's film (a lot of people reviewing the movie here have made that mistake). This is definitely a film for adults, and any adult with the ability to see, hear and reason should enjoy this film.If you don't, I suggest you take a good step back and ask yourself ""what the hell is wrong with me?"" because the ""Triplets of Belleville"" is a universal and beautiful film.A note to the idiots that think this movie is ""anti-American""... grow up and remove your stupid self-centered myopia glasses. This movie pokes fun at people and stereotypes, not just American people, and if you can't laugh at yourself along with everyone else you are too lame for words."
271,The Triplets of Belleville,,21 February 2004,"innovative, intertaining, tooooo long and drawn out.","A fifteen minute animation, extended into a full length movie...unfortunately. The characters are very good and well illustrated, as are the situtations.  Unfortunately the content does not warrant the length of the film.  It is simply too long and becomes boring."
272,The Triplets of Belleville,,13 February 2004,"Good, could have been GREAT","""Triplets"" is a lot of fun to watch.  Unfortunately, the best part of the movie is the AMAZING first 10 minutes.  It hearkens to the best of 1930's style animation, and I could have watched 90 minutes of variations on what was done in the first 10.  The film then becomes sort of a ""mystery thriller"" where we have to find out what happens to the old lady's grandson. The animation is very original, but the storyline is just okay.  Still, it's worth seeing just for the opening 10 minutes."
273,The Triplets of Belleville,,2 February 2004,Fine for the first 40 minutes,"The Triplets of Belleville has about enough content for 40 minutes, but unfortunately lasts nearly 80. They should have taken a lesson from Nick Park, whose Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave this film particularly resembles. The Wallace and Gromit goodies last only about 30 minutes. Less is more, and restraint is a virtue. The first half of Triplets had a lot of witty inventiveness, and I enjoyed it a lot, but, from the time the mother meets up with the aged triplets, I started squirming and checking my watch. It takes too long to be over. A question: what/where is Belleville, sort of a french fried Manhattan? It has a Statue of Liberty, but European signage (speed limits, etc.) and wall sockets (for the vacuum cleaner)."
274,The Triplets of Belleville,,31 January 2004,What's all the talk about ??????,"I've been reading all sorts of comments on the internet, and consequently IMDB about an animated cartoon film by Sylvain Chomet which would appear to be generating more controversy outside France than within the country itself. Most of the people I know hadn't even heard of the film, those that had, and who had seen it, found it pretty repulsive at at best no more than a minor contribution from France ( or was it French Canada - many of the credits relate to Montréal ) to the present day cinematographic scene. I therefore decided to rent the DVD and watch it for myself ......... the film was overlong, most of the characters were ugly and unattractive, notably the cyclist ""Champion"". There were some humorous moments and the behaviour of the dog was funny at times. I see this work as a very personal expression of its creator. No doubt many viewers will find something to please them but few will like the film as a whole.I read about various accusations levelled at the film being anti-american......... now, I am very good at spotting anti-americanism in France because many French are (stupidly) anti-american, basically because they listen to French State and French Establishment progaganda to this effect without actually going to America themselves to get a personal experience of that country. However, I would sincerely not tax ""Les Triplettes"" of being anti-american as they take off all nationalites and first and foremost the French themselves. "" Le Français Moyen "" is the first to be parodied in the film, and I as an Englishman, found this highly amusing. True, you see some fat americans eating hamburgers, but that is just a minor passing detail, and more time is spent poking fun at typical aspects of the French working class and the Tour de France.My main antipathy with the film is that its characters are so damned ugly - many of the sets are well done and there are some intersting ideas, such as Josephine Baker and Fred Astaire being eaten by his dancing shoes. Also I always laugh when old ladies are involved with gangsters !!My overall impression of the film is mildly positive and I would suggest rather than highly recommend people to see it. But as humour is a very personal thing you just cannot predict its effect on any person in particular. What one can say, is that it will not have a universally resounding success such as a the film ""Nemo"" which itelf contains more universal values."
275,The Triplets of Belleville,9,7 February 2004,More than fun and pretty animation...,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Several hours after viewing `The Triplets of Belleville' it occurs to me how fitting the film's name is.  For it's the three ancient sisters-they take on a mythic quality-who, along with the ferociously determined mother of the kidnapped, tragicomic cyclist, are the heroes of this animated epic. 
`The Triplets of Belleville' is a kind of paean to the strength that often lurks under improbable, aging surfaces.  The `little old lady' that the helpful Boy Scout just can't abandon to cross the street alone (despite numerous whacks from her umbrella), and the three old crones, grotesque, seemingly demented, at first sight pitiful and even repellent-pack quite a whammy and are able to put the `French mafia' (whose presence is a flimsy but acceptable contrivance serving merely to advance the character study that's the real meat of the film) squarely in its place.The night-time routines of the triplets brought back vivid memories from childhood, of aged relatives visited during summer vacations.  The blatant suffering that permeates the film from the first frame to the last, is not exaggerated, and I believe the filmmaker shows unusually deep insight into the seemingly inescapable sadness of the human condition.  If you don't agree, wait and live a few more years.  I think you will come around, eventually, like it or not.I rate this film nine stars, not because it's funny (though it surely is) or well animated (though the animation's marvelous), but because it provides abundant insight and food for thought, under its wild and wacky exterior.  I do like a film that I can continue to gnaw on after I leave the auditorium! (Or that gnaws on me...)"
276,The Triplets of Belleville,8,25 January 2004,Fluid Animation,"Today's adult TV animations such as King of the Hill, South Park and Family Guy have learnt that you can economise on the quality of your drawing if you have a wacky storyline and witty script. Les Triplettes de Belleville does without dialog transcending the script with frame after frame of fluid animation creating its own visual language with style and bold caricatures.The story of the French Wine Mafia abducting contestants in the Tour de France is as bizarre as it is irrelevant. It reminded me of the Coen Brothers' O Brother, Where Art Thou - in that the story is largely a vehicle for a collection of songs and situations for bold graphics. The treat here is the imagination with which every caricature and background is drawn. The film is full of unnecessary detail, such as the reflection of Bruno the dog's belly in a polished tile floor. The film combines traditional hand drawn cell animation with computer graphics, but it is so subtle there were only a few scenes where I could spot that 3D CGI was being used.Almost as impressive is the attention paid to the soundtrack. With almost no dialog, the music and sound effects become all the more prominent. At times it is hard to tell whether the audio track leads the visuals or vice versa.For better animation I could look to Nick Park's A Close Shave and Frédéric Back's The Man Who Planted Trees - and that is about it."
277,The Triplets of Belleville,,31 January 2004,Overrated Jacques Tati wanna-be,"The current French film that critics have ""discovered"" is actually a very boring, predictable re-run of choice aspects of the oeuvre of Jacques Tati and ""Delicatessen"".The drawing style is original and the film's first twenty minutes promise great things, but once the plot is set in motion by the kidnapping of a trio of Tour De Frog cyclists, the rot sets in and predictability follows.Nothing here engages the viewer because the plot is thin as paper and the inevitable climax is ho-hum. There is no jeopardy. The protagonists aren't clever. They simply exist. The resolution has no drama.The Triplets of the title are old, withered dance hall queens we meet in the film's cheerful prologue. As young women they're likable, as old farts they're dull.At a meager seventy-four minutes the film feels interminable."
278,The Triplets of Belleville,9,17 January 2004,Delightful film.  Just sit back and enjoy it!,"Delightful film.  Just sit back and enjoy it!  Great story, wonderful animation and the satire is right on the mark.  I plan to see it again as there is a lot going on that needs further viewing. In addition the filmmakers have created the grandmother that we all desire.  Bon appetit! (Apologies to all the Ranas)."
279,The Triplets of Belleville,10,26 January 2004,Tati meets Django meets...,"OK, I'll make it short. I just watched this anime on my plasma screen. I consider it the most original movie ever created and I am somehow happy it comes from someone else than the usual suspects (Pixar, Dreamworks, Disney...). The picture is flawless, the music is perfect, the story is anti-hero-esque but poetic at most. It Les Triplettes do not get oscarized, I then consider the Oscar as bullsh*t lobby-esque self promotion."
280,The Triplets of Belleville,9,6 January 2004,"Great animation, amusing.","This is one of the best animation movies I've seen since Spirited Away. The Triplets of Belleville is unique in creating a story without using much dialogue. It has fascinating and original animation. The way the movie was made and conveyed was intriguing. Good songs, it's fun and entertaining. Although the actual storyline isn't superb, everything else about it is.The movie overall is to be taken lightly and to be able to laugh at society. I found the hidden messages such as all the fat Americans eating hamburgers to be amusing and humorous. I would definitely recommend this movie so you can judge it for yourself."
281,The Triplets of Belleville,10,5 January 2004,forget disney,"forget disney-style animation, cute creatures, fussy colours etc. this is another world - bizzare, strange, weird and SO charming... sorry - i guess i can´t express how much was i astonished by this animated masterpiece, you have to see and feel it yourselves."
282,The Triplets of Belleville,10,3 January 2004,not your father's animation :-),"we absolutely loved this film. it's completely original, wildly imaginative, beautifully drawn, and one of the wittiest things i've seen in years.  not always politically correct, maybe, but actually that's a plus.  let's hear it for grandma power!"
283,The Triplets of Belleville,10,28 December 2003,Brilliant,"The triplets of Belleville is a story about a child and his grandmother, and the quest for the grandmother to make that child happy.The animation is fantastic. And the music is so good, people came out of the movie theater singing it.(btw, stay till past the credits...)Oh, and if you are seeing this movie in the US (I don't know everywhere else) you'll get a bonus: ""Destino"", a short film made by Disney in France, based on documents of a project between Walt Disney and Salvador Dali, which was shelved at the time."
284,The Triplets of Belleville,10,27 December 2003,Brilliant,"I saw this amazing piece of cinema unknowing of what is was. this was possibly the weirdest film i have ever seen without a doubt. Its kookier than eraserhead and i was unable to even comprehend anything wierder than eraserhead. But, this cinematic masterpeice is possibly the best thing to come out of france since freedom fries."
285,The Triplets of Belleville,10,25 December 2003,"Rich , inspired and wonderful.","Seeing this really opened my eyes.This animated movie touches so many things of other movies and society and makes you laugh at the same time , being ""funny cuz' it's true"".The drawing style is nothing short of amazing.It's really a shame this feature is rather short because it's in one word : Magnificent."
286,The Triplets of Belleville,,4 January 2004,A Very Strange Animated Trip and the Slowest 80 Minutes,"""The Triplets of Belleville"" is a very different kind of animated movie that is not conventional in any way.  My sister, brother-in-law, and I are all fans of animated movies, but clearly not this kind.  We saw this movie at Manhattan's Lincoln Plaza, and for sure, there wasn't a single youngster there, so naturally this was not made for children in mind.   The film was conceived and directed by Sylvain Chomet.  The drawings are from the old-fashioned Disney pen-and-ink mainly from ""101 Dalmations"" in an age of computer-animated films, the sensibilities are borrowed from those of the Betty Boop cartoons and some classic Tex Avery cartoons, and there is a surprising amount of pervesity a la Ralph Bakshi (always remember that the name Bakshi means ""no kids cartoons) such as a topless dancer and animal cruelty, which I'll get to later.   As for this slow-moving 80 minute movie, to make this long story short, it is about an orphan raised by his doting grandmother named Madame Souza who gives him a bicycle and then trains and feeds him rigorously enough to compete in the Tour de France races, and naming him Champion.  Once there, a tired Champion walks into a truck driven by two men both drawn to resemble the Men in Black.  These men work for the French Mafia and kidnap Champion all the way to Belleville for the Mafia's own version of the Tour De France, where they bet on Champion and two other victims for self-profit in a gambling hall.  When Madame Souza learns about this, she and her dog, Bruno, leaves Paris and enters Belleville, where she encounters her favorite dance hall trio a la the Andrews Sisters from the 1930's, now haggard old crones, and Madame Souza, the triplets, and the dog search everywhere for Champion.   Now what makes this movie so strange?  This movie first begins with the triplets singing and dancing, and in the middle of the act, Josephine Baker comes in and dances topless, and Fred Astaire comes in and dances, only to be eaten alive by his shoes.  As for the town of Belleville, it is a strange metropolis that looks like New York, with many fat denizens, and their Statue of Liberty resembles a fat man eating a hamburger, thus making fun of the obese.  The Triplets live in a squalid fly-infested apartment and live solely on an all-frog diet, blowing up all the frogs at a nearby swamp and cooking them to death.  Also the animal cruelty comes in as well as the treatment of frogs where Madame Souza is seen riding on her dog.  I would also like to add that my sister and I kept looking at our watch, although the movie is short. What makes it slow is that there is minimal action, minimal dialogue that almost plays like a silent movie and has only one line uttered (Remember when mime Marcel Marceau had the only speaking part in Mel Brooks' ""Silent Movie?""), one song and dance number sung in French, and one has to figure out the plot through its actions.  The two interesting parts in this movie were where Madame Souza blows her whistle to rescue Champion from the race, and the French Mafia, the coolest mafia who upstages all the bland main characters.  I liked how they all wore oversized shoulder-pads, looked like the Men in Black, lit cigarettes stylishly, and walked to ominous music.  Other than the Mafia, forget it!"
287,The Triplets of Belleville,8,28 December 2003,France 1 Mickey Mouse 0,"'Belleville Rendezvous' is a brilliantly weird piece of animation.  We're all used to visual inventiveness from cartoons, but the surreal nature of the jokes in this (beautifully animated) film take it into another realm, and remind one of how many of even the best cartoons exist within a defined world of certain possibilities - the way that this film combines 'Tom and Jerry'-style jokes with a deeply melancholic world view is astonishingly fresh.  Also remarkable is its pace - the film is put together in the manner of a non-animated feature, reflecting the rhythm of its character's absurd lives as opposed to simply stringing together a direct sequence of gags. Add the film's sly take on the Franco-American cultural rivalry and you have a winner.  If you liked 'Delicatessan', you'll love this."
288,The Triplets of Belleville,9,16 December 2003,Strange and Wonderful,"There were ten or twelve in our party, including my family, and at least four animators and their girlfriends. Finding seats for a group our size was achallenge, even though we got there early, and even though they had movedthe screening into the largest theater at the AFI Fest. It was Sylvain Chomet's ""The Triplets of Belleville,"" and everybody wants to see this flick.
As they damn well should. ""The Triplets of Belleville"" is a great, weird movie. It tells its strange, kidnapping story almost entirely without dialogue, and even though some of the words are presented in English, the humor is all French,soaked through. Most in my party audibly giggled when a scene featured aposter for ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" hanging in the background. The spirit of Jaques Tati is fully alive in ""Triplets,"" although in darker, more surreal, occasionally more vulgar surroundings than Hulot ever hung in. The movie is not overly shy about nudity, or non-functioning toilets, or violent death, or even less Disney- esque elements, such as old people. Damn if this movie isn't populated by abunch of seniors, who are not only eccentric and cranky, with saggy flesh and age spots, but they're also the story's heroes! And if my kids, who laughed and laughed for the whole 80 minutes, are any indication, it would never occur to a child that an animated movie without a fresh-faced princess or a talking animal for a hero was missing something.My only complaint with the picture is a brief, seafaring sequence in the middle in which the animators, for some terrible reason, decided to use digital animation for the water rather than the hand-drawn work that makes the rest of the movie so rich. The pixely sheen of the waves made the scene stick out like acompound fracture, and it just didn't seem at all necessary.Still, it is the animated film of this year, hands-down. Whether it wins the Oscar will depend on how beholden the animation committee feels to step in line with all the hoo-ha over the limp, overrated ""Finding Nemo."" The fact that they gave the award last year to the great ""Spirited Away"" indicates that they know the difference between quality and hype, so there is more than a little hope. Also, nominations for Best Song and Best Score would be not be out of line, although the score may be just a touch too quirky for the Music Branch. They like a lot of strings, those people."
289,The Triplets of Belleville,9,2 November 2003,"Not perfect, but stylishly great","It is hard to comment on movies, which obviously have a bit more to them than simply entertainment value.However, entertainment in this animation, there is. The parody on most any American action movie is there. The clear-cut and excellent drawings are there.This, is art. And an excellent piece of it, in my opinion. There are some things which I object to, on merely subjective basis (the long starting eg.), but that movie is great.Not for the popcorn eating ""find'em, shoot'em"" fan of animations though. The rhythm is slower. Think Paris of '30ies, not New York of '90ies."
290,The Triplets of Belleville,,30 October 2003,see this film. see it now.,"I saw this gorgeous little film yesterday and since have recommended it to every single person i have spoken to. Belleville is wonderful, quirky, weird, hilarious, terrifying, disturbing beautiful. There is no particular aspect of this film i can pinpoint as what makes this film the gem that it is, it just has to be seen to be believed. How Chomet has managed to create such emotion from nothing but(wonderfully disproportioned) drawings i will never know. See this film. See it. Now."
291,The Triplets of Belleville,,10 October 2003,"Weird,Crazy,Nonsensical - A must see","I saw this with a pretty much open mind, i had read a very short review of this in Guardian (i think) - i read things from so many online sources im never sure these days. The review i read was from someone who had taken their girlfriend and spent little time watching it. The film began with Madame Souza and Champion watching a performance on tv. After a few minutes it began to dawn on you just how much work had gone into this film, the animation was brillient, so detailed and every inch packed with interest and intrigue. By about 1/4 way through the film the storyline seemed to have dissapeared, it seemed to make little sense and was very weird - the three old ladies who we see many years before at the start of the film are past eccentric , more creepy and weird. We are introduced to a lot of interesting unique characters in this film and more than a few styles of animation - mainly highly detailed hand drawn with the occasional use of 3 dimensional computer like graphics which all add to the effect as do the many funny little quips and happenings thorughout. - all in all a must see.Chris P from Loosewire.co.ukP.S Stay till the VERY end"
292,The Triplets of Belleville,7,3 October 2003,Enjoyable variation on the animation films menu,"I enjoyed watching this film just because it offered an attractive alternative to what Hollywood had to offer recently. Not that I dislike major animation films like Finding Nemo or Shrek, but this French director Chomet has shown us just how ""the adult"" cartoons should look and sound like. I would describe it as ""no non-sence"" animation: no stupid dialogues, just pure fun. The story-line of this film is not that strong as its visual side though, but this is normally a downside of almost all animation films. And one more thing: Mme Sauza is one of my favorite characters this year. 7/10."
293,The Triplets of Belleville,8,28 September 2003,Reminds me of Heavy Metal comic,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It reminded me of the artwork and storylines featured in the comic Heavy metal (Metal Hurlant) or Raw comix. Unfortunately this comic now features more sex stories as I guess sex sells. I would not be surprised if Choumet was a contributor. My only criticism was the over long chase at the end but most masterpieces are flawed.
294,The Triplets of Belleville,9,17 September 2003,Praise God for french-speaking wierdos,"Fab, wierd, crazy.  I wish my grandmas had been that cool.  Go watch this for lots of extremely well designed animation,a totally loopy bunch of old women and a crazy dog. I absolutely loved it.  I would highly recommend it for a hour or so of relaxation."
295,The Triplets of Belleville,9,13 September 2003,Another piece of great animation,"It is very nice to see that Pixar, Myazaki, Amstrong are not alone in the world of amazing animations, and it is even better that one is really different from the others. I don't think one has to understand about France culture a lot to get the animation. The symbolisms of the movie are very clear. The story is simple, and better, it does not have any dialogs, all are conveyed through the excellent caracters expressions, music, movements, and sounds. All characters are really funny, specially the dog. This film is not targeted to any specific age, I reckon everybody who loves a different, creative, innovative piece of art, will love this movie. 9 / 10"
296,The Triplets of Belleville,10,10 September 2003,"A unique, ingenious, hilarious, gorgeously-animated feature","I got to see ""Triplets of Belleville"" at the Telluride Film Festival, where it was screened along with ""Destino,"" the recently completed Dali/Disney collaboration based on sketches and storyboards that are nearly sixty years old.  A lot of folks went to the screening just to see Destino.  It was OK, sort of a montage of various Dali images that blend into each other. ""Triplets,"" however, turned out to be one of the finest animated features I've ever seen, and I've been a rabid fan  of just about all types of animation since I was in diapers.The combination of the film's exquisite artwork and the gentle humor of the story kept me completely enthralled for the whole running time.  The story is about a tight-knit little family consisting of a fanatically devoted young cyclist, his shrewlike but determined mother, and the increasingly bloated family dog.  To say that sight gags abound would be an understatement.  While the character design and backgrounds are substantially more intricate and the animation more fluid, the visual style is reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's cartoons in Monty Python And The Holy Grail, etc.  Every character's features are dramatically exaggerated, from the protagonist's massive, Gallic nose, and swollen biker's calves, to the dog's 400:1 torso-to-leg proportions.  The mobster goon squad that collects overheated bikers during the Big Race (to be installed in a bizarre, underground gambling-oriented exhibit) are particularly hilarious--essentially a pair of giant, black, fedora-sporting monoliths a la 2001.  Two of them frequently link up and trot down ill-lit hallways like modular furniture come to life.  An appropriately goofball approach to physics accompanies these characters and the wacky spaces they frequent. The story has some creepy edges, but it remains very warm and light-hearted (in an intelligent, non-sappy way) all the way through.  And the music is terrific!It was announced at the screening that ""Triplets"" has been picked up by Sony Pictures Classics, which is very good news.  Here's hoping this wonderful film finds as wide as possible distribution in the US and elsewhere, and I'm already anticipating the DVD release.  It would be great to hear a commentary from or see interviews with the French/Canadian/Belgian crew behind this one.  Great job, guys (and gals).  Can't wait for your next project!"
297,The Triplets of Belleville,,9 September 2003,Half a spoonful of sugar,"Weird and wonderful, this Gallic animation strikes a rare balance between innocent charm and wry observation. It is playful and sweetly humourous, yet has a sinister edge, and blurs the distinction between adult- and child-oriented entertainment. The bottom-up perspective that the viewer is afforded (with little dialogue, and an absence of explanatory narrative) determines that, no-matter your age, you will perceive the film as an enraptured child might, feeling your way through a semi-coherent world. This impression is strengthened by the comically exaggerated features and motions that characterise the sumptuous artistry of the animation. Chomet combines a classic look and feel with modern techniques to establish an original style, rich in detail. He succeeds in crafting a touching tale and lovable characters without resorting to the industry-standard templates. Watch out for references to the Fleischer Studios (especially the jazz-flavoured Betty Boop), and to the house of mouse - you won't find anything as joyfully eccentric as this emerging from the latter."
298,The Triplets of Belleville,,4 September 2003,See it and join the cult,"If good films make a statement this one has statement written all over it. You come out laughing and the images keep returning. The dog that dreams people bark at it, the ice lolly frogs, the undefeatable granny playing jazz on a cycle wheel, the ocean liners that go upwards for ever, the hoods with their black shoulders like boxes.It's the story of the creation of a tour de France cyclist and how he is kidnapped and rescued from a fate worse than death. So are you any the wiser? Of course not. It's one of those experiences that sends you out of the movie theatre feeling ""I have to tell someone about this."" and you will. But they won't understand either!It's a full length cartoon, with addictive jazz that will generate a healthy secondary market in CDs. Much much better than your average action movie and adult in a way that has nothing to do with acres of flesh.See it soon."
299,The Triplets of Belleville,,8 June 2003,Disney Beware,"I have seen this film at the International Animation film  Festival of Annecy, France. I was completely blown away by it. The visual style of the film is simply never before seen. It's 3D effects are blended in beautifully with the 2D animation. At the end of the film, the audience gave the director a standing ovation and thundering applause for the entire duration of the closing credits. He stood there completely speechless. 'Les Triplettes de Belleville' is truly the strangest and best feature length animated film I've seen in a long, long time. If you're into animation, you should really go see it!"
300,The Triplets of Belleville,,22 December 2003,Viva La France!,TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE (2003) **** French filmmaker Sylvian Chomet's wonderful animation valentine to the classic old school animation of Max Fleischer et al has its own wickedly gorgeous/grotesque caricature look about it in this highly inventive cartoon about a doting club-footed grandma whose over-protective love for her bicycling grandson (literally named Champion) finds her attempting to save him from nefarious kidnappers who abscond with the athlete and only her faithful overweight dog Bruno and the vaudevillian title act (think the witches from Macbeth meeting The Andrews Sisters) helping her only leads to some truly funny and sweetly nutty adventures in the process. Unique in its execution and a nearly silent movie the film is one of the year's absolute treasures.
301,The Triplets of Belleville,,18 December 2003,a worthless resource of ridiculousness,"other than the smelly subject of good vs. evil; this movie was not cheesy, reason being that nothing in the movie made sense. and in a a way this non-senseness is really wrong. we were a party of four and all four of us wondered why people were laughing at a dog walking down the stairs. all throughout the movie people were laughing at similar situations making us wonder what was wrong with us.the animation in this movie was of no significant value. All I remember was that it had pale colors... Again; the plot was *nonsense* to a point where you didn't expect anything from the movie anymore.I see people are comparing it to Spirited Away which makes me sad, because I went to this movie with high expectations and I was waiting it to be over after 10 minutes, but I watched Spirited Away by chance and was amazed by it. This movie is about good vs. evil which Spirited Away did not bother touching...Honestly, this movie does not try to be anything and it looks as if it is produced as a joke.The soundtrack was the only thing that was allright about the movie but it cannot do anything to save the things I have witnessed happen. I have never felt this bad about a movie and I cannot beleive the positive reviews here. I do not know much about *the French comedy* or how hard it is to create an animation like this but I just hope i wont pay to see another movie like this. i signed up to imdb just to write this review."
