0,The Aristocats,,26 March 2001,Superb Visual Style and Humor in one of Disney's best!,"Complaints from previous commentators that ""the pencil marks show"" in the animated art shows that they miss the point entirely. The visual style is deliberately similar to what was used in '101 Dalmatians' with the characters having a deliberately sketchy look--an art style used to great effect in this and several other Disney movies. Far from being ""weak animation"", this is one of the very best works produced by the Disney artists. The color is superb, the humor is constant and the mere fact that the storyline bears a resemblance to the 'Dalmatians' plot does nothing to weaken the film. Upon release, it was an enormous success and has made even more money in subsequent theatrical revivals. Viewers who make comments about the art work, don't seem to realize that the ""sketchy"" look was what the artists sought--it has nothing whatsoever to do with careless art work. All the voices are extremely well done--Eva Gabor as the Duchess and Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley are perfect. The slapstick comedy involving the bumbling butler and the dogs is priceless! This is another great Disney film that children and adults can enjoy equally."
1,The Aristocats,8,22 September 2000,Snoop Dogg loves The Aristocats,"No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm. Plus, everything moves at a relaxed pace, and even the villain isn't all that scary. It's perfect for the younger set while not being so sappy that adults can't like it. If Snoop was here, I'm sure he would say the same thing. Yeah. Dig those CRAZY cats, man."
2,The Aristocats,9,1 September 2004,Everybody wants to be a cat!,"AristoCats is such a terrific Disney classic that I just loved so much as a kid. Still to this day I can't resist watching it, it's just such a wonderful and charming film with great animation and lovely songs. I really miss the animation films like AristoCats, they had perfect voices not to mention the hand drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family. AristoCats is also very witty and clever, the story was just so wonderful. This film is just beyond irresistible, I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano learning the appecio's, lol, it was just so cute with the piano playing and painting.Douchess and her kittens are very pampered in their huge mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like they were her children. But when the lady feels it's time to make her will, she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler. The butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and abondons them in the middle of no where. Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat by the name of Thomas O'Malley, they head back home to their lady, but learn the coolness of being a skat cat.The AristoCats is just a perfect Disney movie that I feel is a bit over looked. I would always highly recommend this movie for kids or families, it could be enjoyed by anyone. The songs and story is just memorable. I will always join in for the movies best song ""Everybody wants to be a cat"", such a great tune. I also love those dogs that guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned, they were just so cute. This is a terrific film, please watch it, you won't be disappointed.9/10"
3,The Aristocats,10,8 May 2006,A great underrated Disney classic.,"Set in Paris in the year 1910, a retired old rich opera singer decides to give her fortune away to her beautiful cat Duchess ( voiced by Eva Gabor) and her kittens, but the jealous butler Edgar comes up with a plan as he kidnaps the cats and leaves them in the countryside. Luckily for them with the help of a streetwise and independent tomcat named Thomas O'Malley ( voiced by Phil Harris) helps them get home especially meeting some of his good friends like the swinging' Scat Cat ( voiced by Scatman Crothers) and try to foil Edgar's plans.Very entertaining and edgy post-Walt Disney's death animated movie with a couple of nice jazzy tunes like the memorable ""Everybody wants to be a cat"", good voice acting and some terrific animation for it's time even in these times of computer animation. Not one of the greatest Disney animated movies but a cult Disney animated fave and one of the few gems of it's day that works well, highly recommended."
4,The Aristocats,,27 May 2000,For kids to enjoy. And it's cool!,"> Kids will love this movie, just as they should. But, actually I thought it was cool! The characters and the music (ScatCat rocks) are fantastic to listen to, and the soundtrack is to be recommended.                              An old lady makes her beloved cats the owner of her money, in her will. Her clumsy butler, Edgar, finds this idea very stupid and annoying. And a problem, since he was certain that the money would go to him. So, wise as he is, he decides to get the cats out of the picture, so he can get all the cash. Of course. He grabs them in a rainy night and throw them away in a swamp way outside the city in France.                              Can't be missing in your Disney-collection."
5,The Aristocats,8,25 May 2002,"Not among's Disney's very best, but still enjoyable","The first Disney animated film without the strong involvement of Disney himself, this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (this is, I believe, the only animated Disney film since the 1940's which is NOT based on an earlier book or other work, but is rather an original story). As others have noted, the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in Lady and the Tramp and the kidnapping/journey home story in 101 Dalmatians.But to overcome this flaw, the filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the Disney animated films of the previous 10-15 years: Phil Harris (from The Jungle Book) voicing one of the main characters, follows his duet with Louis Prima in the previous film with another here with Scatman Crothers. The quality visual look of this film is virtually carried over from ""Dalmatians"" (with some nice nods to French Impressionism, it appears), and the villain here (the butler) is strongly reminiscent of the henchmen in that film as well. (This is probably one of Disney's least memorable villains.) The main story goes back and forth between the cats, and the butler's ongoing difficulties with two rural hound dogs (with great voice work by Pat Buttram and George ""Goober"" Lindsey""). The various animal characters are similarly familiar to those who have seen ""Tramp"" and ""Dalmatians."" The cats' owner, while bearing a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother in Sleeping Beauty, bears none of that character's nasty traits and comes across as very warm and generous.The real strength of the film is the voice work; after first going toward the use of mostly familiar actors in The Jungle Book, the tactic is continued strongly here with Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway from The Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor (who would do a very similar character in the later film The Rescuers), as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp. All are excellent here, particularly Harris and Gabor in the leads. The character animation is as excellent as one would expect, showing a variety of emotions well.Smaller children may be upset by a few brief episodes (an escape from the path of a speeding train, a near-drowning by one of the children), but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark manner and are over very quickly. Overall, there's very little of the type of more frightening scenes found in many other Disney classics.One minor oddity is the way some visual aspects of 60's culture are depicted among the jazz-performing cats in supposedly 1910 Paris; one can't help but wonder why the story wasn't set solidly in the present, other than the great deal Paris had changed much of its appearance in the intervening time. It really would have made more sense that way.The songs, while being pleasant and sometimes very enjoyably performed, are not particularly memorable. Nonetheless, the general energy applied here, the excellent voice work and fine animation all contribute to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses. Far from the greatness of classic ""10""s such as Pinocchio or Aladdin, and not quite up to the ""9""s one might give to Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, this is probably a rather marginal 8 of 10; perhaps a 7."
6,The Aristocats,8,23 March 2007,"Sweet, Romantic and Completely Underrated!","This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley. You may recognize his voice, as he also furnished the voice of Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book, and Little John in Disney's Robin Hood. Eva Gabor lends her silky sweet voice to Dutchess.Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, who directed, or worked on, every Disney animated film worth mentioning until his death in 1985.This is among my very favorite of the Disney animated feature films, and belongs in any Disney collection. The 2-Disk Special Edition Is Due Out This Summer (2007).This rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :."
7,The Aristocats,7,4 July 2007,Overlooked?,"The 20th animated Disney classic is often criticized by many people as ""mediocre"" or poor in quality, but it is a good movie.Despite being extremely underrated, it is one of the funniest Disney classics. It is full of hilarious (some of them, hysterical) moments.Edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain but a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favorite Disney villains because he is so funny.Every scene with Edgar and the two stupid hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you'll ever see, especially the one when Edgar drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge, with the dogs chasing him. That is hysterical!But the classic humor doesn't just come from Edgar or the hound dogs. Other characters have their moments as well.About the quality subject, it isn't perfect, but remains on a high level. Even after Walt Disney's death those artists knew how to keep faithful to Walt's spirit and ""The Aristocats"" is one of those examples. They no longer make them like this!As usual, legendary Disney actors voice the characters. In this case, we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram.The characters are generally cool: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and her 3 kittens, the mouse Roquefort, the alley cats, the English geese, the hound dogs and the horse. The human characters are included as well: the eccentric and kind retired Opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, the comic Madame's old lawyer Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself!About the soundtrack, it has some nice and catchy songs such as Thomas O'Malley's theme (but I can't remember its name), ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"" and ""The Aristocats"" (sung by Maurice Chevalier), for example.This movie takes place in Paris (France), in the year of 1910. A classic, often underestimated and forgotten, but worthy."

He co-directed several Disney movies such as Aristocats , Jungle Book , 101 Dalmatians , Peter Pan , Cinderella , Dumbo , among others ."
9,The Aristocats,6,28 September 2013,The Paris Book,"In 1920s France an eccentric Duchess plans to leave her estate to her privileged kitties (Cattingtons?). Her nefarious, Prince Charles-lookalike butler overhears her plans and schemes to have the cats disappeared. He drugs them, for some reason, and dumps them in the countryside. Surely a quick warm up in the oven would have been a more foolproof plan. And why even bother disposing of the cats? Surely getting rid of the Duchess should be his first priority. I mean she could potentially live for another 25 years.Once out in the French countryside they meet up with jiving, self-confident stray Tom (that's an original name for an animated cat) who makes it his mission to take them back to Paris. He's basically a feline Baloo. He's even voiced by Phil Harris. Along the way they meet various characters and eventually confront the Butler who plotted against them.If it sounds familiar that's because it's basically a rewritten version of Disney's Jungle Book. It even has King Louie type of cat. This isn't really a bad thing, but it lacks the necessary spark to make it a classic. The animation is colorful and the period French setting provides some lovely backgrounds. It's just not anything too special, sadly."
10,The Aristocats,,22 July 2004,One of Disney's better features,"The Aristocats is one of my favorite animated movies, but the comparisons between this movie and past Disney classics are reasonable. The dog napping plot of One Hundred and One Dalmatians is adapted to fit the catnapping plot of The Aristocats. O'Malley and Duchess are reconstructions of Lady and the Tramp at heart. But, as long as the end result is just as enjoyable as the past movies, why complain? No matter how the success was achieved, as long as it was achieved. The plot is simple. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is an old millionaires spinster in Paris, 1910. The only other people in her lonely life are her cat, Duchess, and her kittens, Toulouse, Marie and Berlioz, as well as the faithful butler, Edgar. When Madame's lawyer, Georges, comes over to make Madame's will, Edgar overhears her plans. She wants to leave all her belongings to her cats, and at the end of their lifespan, the vast sums of money will go to Edgar. Quite unreasonably, Edgar is infuriated, and drugs and catnaps the kittens and dumps them in the French countryside, miles from home. There they find Thomas O'Malley, an alley cat who helps them back home, mainly because of Duchess.The characterization of O'Malley certainly doesn't seem to have been a problem. Voiced by Phil Harris (Baloo from The Jungle Book), he also acts like the lovable bear and even looks just like you would imagine Baloo to look like, were he transmogrified into a cat. His bunch of jazz cats, led by Scat Cat, are some of the more effective Disney cameo-players. My favorite was the long-haired, blonde English Cat (besides Scat Cat, the rest have no names but clearly distinct nationalities). Roquefort the house-mouse and Frou-Frou the horse have brief roles, but shine in these glimpses. Edgar isn't really the real Disney villain in that he is not evil...he is simply impatient. He is not cruel from the start--his only sin is impatience. If he hadn't known about the will, he would've taken care of the cats as if nothing had happened. One sees his point in a way--what would those cats DO with the money? Madame could have given her estate to Edgar, and the butler would never have abandoned the cats had they not been privileged more than himself. So I like Edgar, in some ways.The story is a mix of other Disney classics. Besides Fantasia--which had NO plot--this was Disney's first shot at writing an original story for an animated feature, and even so they had to take shortcuts. Here are the main plot elements repeated: 1) Villain-pet naps-animals-for-personal-gain from One Hundred and One Dalmatians. 2) Pampered-pet-learns-of-life-on-streets-through-streetwise-friend from Lady and the Tramp. It also borrows a little bit from Chuck Jones and Abe Levitow's Gay Purr-ee (1962). The plot is berated for being too shallow, but I don't see how it can be with so many elements of faultless classics. Again, as in the first paragraph: If the audience enjoys a story, it doesn't matter how the story developed.The animation, so often blasted for being lazy and flawed, can never be seen the same way by everyone. It's solely a matter of opinion. The animation isn't bad, like television cartoons: it's a different style, radically different from, say, Sleeping Beauty. If that great fairy tale were portrayed by such animation, it would be the greatest failure in history; the same way, the sketchy, loose, carefree style of The Aristocats is perfect to tell that kind of story with those characters. Sleeping Beauty needed to be immaculate, as near to photography as could be; The Aristocats is the most cartoony of Disney animated features.The Aristocats will always have an advantage over many films in my book. It was one of the few movies my dad saw in theater, so I was exposed to it more than several other movies. Besides that, it has always been one of Disney's more enjoyable features, more fun than most. It doesn't aim for the realism and drama of Bambi. It's just wholesome entertainment.9/10"
11,The Aristocats,10,21 October 2003,Soooo romantic!!!,"Since cats have nine lives, I'll give you nine reasons to see this movie:* The kittens Berlioz and Toulouse playing the piano together (so unbelievably cute!) * The car-chasing dogs Napoleon and Lafayette * Toulouse jumping like electrified every time he wants to be like a tough alley cat * Marie sighing romantically while alley cat O'Malley seduces her mom * Scat Cat and his jazz band, singing ""ev'rybody wants to be a cat"" * Stupid but proper and nice English geese Amelia and Abigail who make the cats walk like geese * O'Malley obtaining the ""magic carpet"" which puts the Cheshire cat to shame * Roquefort the brave mouse's journey to ask help from alley cats * Edgar the butler chase scenes and transition from a nice guy to an insane cat hater due to cat riddance plan gone bad"
12,The Aristocats,9,27 February 2009,One of the better Disney movies after the Jungle Book,"The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all, Everybody wants to be a Cat is a classic and the title song is brilliantly sung by Gigi's Maurice Chavelier. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.(a good thing)The plot(about a greedy butler and a fortune, reminds me of Bailey's Billions) was a little unoriginal, but worked very well, and the script was really funny, especially the fights between the kittens. They remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. My favourite scene was the chase of Edgar with the two dogs, who were always fighting about who was the leader. The voice talents were a delight, most notably Phil Harris, whom I recognised from the Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor, from the Rescuers. The supporting characters, namely Scat Cat, were also well done. In conclusion, a really pleasant film, that is definitely underrated. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
13,The Aristocats,6,27 May 2013,Struggles to stand out amongst Disney's more accomplished classics,"In 1910 Paris, a cat named Duchess (Eva Gabor) lives comfortably in a mansion with her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin), and her wealthy owner Madame Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley). Madame writes her will along with her eccentric lawyer, and decides to leave her vast wealth to her beloved cats. Her dedicated butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) overhears this, and, outraged at being left out of the will, kidnaps the cats and leaves them stranded in the countryside. Frightened and alone, they come across a charming drifter cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who teaches the privileged cats about the joys of being a wanderer.Apart from the obvious similarities to Disney's previous efforts, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and 101 Dalmatians (1961), there are two things about The Aristocats that troubled me. The first is the plot, that paints clumsy butler Edgar as the villain. Of course, dumping a family of cats in the countryside to die isn't the nicest thing to do, but after hearing the woman he's dedicated his life to leave her fortune to a bunch of f*****g cats, you can kind of sympathise with the poor guy. The other is the ending, that sees (spoiler ahead!) lovable tramp O'Malley welcomed into the aristocracy - shiny collar and all - because it seems the upper classes just won't have any individuality in their midst.This was the final film Walt Disney greenlit before his death in 1966, and one that had five of Disney's so-called Nine Old Men on animating duties. It could be seen as one the final 'classic' animated films that Disney produced before they experienced a difficult decade or so, and it does retain that warm, familiar feeling that the likes of Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) lacked (although they are certainly considered amongst Disney's best achievements). The songs are wonderful, particularly the standout Everybody Wants To Be a Cat, headed by Scatman Crothers and featuring one of Disney's funniest casually- racist characters. Yet the similarities to other, better Disney classics damage the film, and apart from the beautiful, hand-drawn animation and top-tapping tunes, The Aristocats struggles to stand out.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
14,The Aristocats,4,2 July 2010,As Dispirited as it is Dispiriting,"There are days when I am convinced that the Universe knows deep down what is best for me. This was most recently evidenced when the VCR ate my copy of Aristocats and promptly died, thus taking my retrospective project hostage. Now whether it was the toxic nature of the film that killed the player or the independent actions of the player to commit such a noble act on behalf of my senses, who can really say? Nevertheless, I managed to overcome all obstacles to bare my mind one more time to the spiraling saga of the ""lost years"" of Disney.Frankly, Aristocats seems a step back (if there can be one) from its predecessors. The animation is even more scratchy: pencil lines streak the characters with unprecedented gusto. Madame holds the unfortunate distinction of being one of the ugliest drawn characters Disney has ever spewed out, though none of her costars are beauty queens by a long shot. The only really successful character is Georges because his scratchy, wavering persona works in harmony with the style.The story is a shambles as well. I can't even give the film a heads up for being in Paris, for there's nothing remotely Parisian about it with the exception of the title sequence showcasing Maurice Chevallier (who by his presence makes that the best sequence of the whole film and nothing even happens during it). It's as if all the faults of the Jungle Book were given a shot of heroin and told to run with it. Jazzy music a few decades too early and enough beatnik to make me wonder if Woodstock was happening around the corner. Everybody wants to be a cat was so terribly out of context- the strobe-lights, drum kits, scatting, drug references and occasionally raunchy (for Disney) lyrics were jarring and unpleasant on the palette. We cannot even get away from cloying child characters, though thankfully, we respect the human- animal interaction boundaries this time. I have to say the only things remotely charming in this film were the odious comic relief in the form of the country dogs and, to a lesser extent, the British geese. Two things that had absolutely nothing to do with the story, but were obvious fillers since the producers saw what was essential could in no way stand on its own.If you can't have interesting leads or music or a good plot, the least you can do is offer up an entertaining foe. However, Edgar is undeniably the worst villain in the Disney canon- not remotely clever enough to be a believable menace. Seriously- his math and reasoning aren't even junior high level, he decides to kill the cats before the benefactor even dies (therefore not only not speeding up his inheritance a minute, but also allowing her the opportunity to adopt even younger cats) and he drugs them when they would have trusted him enough to let him stuff him in a sack (as he actually DID in the last act). To top it off, he's not a serious physical threat or, especially condemning, remotely funny. Even Robin Hood managed to scrape up a villain who could do one of those!Not to say that there are no redeeming qualities. Though Everybody Wants to Be a Cat bugs me in context, it is not entirely offensive to the ears and is quite catchy. Eva Gabor and Phil Harris are great, though they were both better in other Disney roles- him as Baloo and her as Miss Bianca. Maurice Chevallier coats the opening with his characteristic lovable frenchiness- the one place that takes advantage of the Parisian setting. Speaking of settings, though the character animation was quite hideous, the backgrounds were lovely- especially at times where they became almost soggy and washed out. It is, after all, still Disney.Everybody, even manic Disneylovers, has a certain film they unleash all their scorn and frustration on. Aristocats is mine, partly because its ugly and lackluster in the long line of progressively uglier and lacklust(ier) films, but mostly because by this point it seemed like they just didn't care. Previous efforts has been misguided and faltered in some way or another, but never had there been such an obvious abandonment before, though I'll reserve my judgement on the after a while yet.Quote of the film: Uncle Waldo- ""Prime Country Goose A la Provencale, stuffed with chestnuts""...? ""And basted in white wine."" Hic! O'Malley- Basted? He's been marinated in it!"
15,The Aristocats,6,18 October 2006,DIG THESE CATS...and all that JAZZ!,"The ''The AristoCats'' was one of the first Disney's movies that I watched as a child. Five days ago, I had the opportunity of watching this movie again in a friend's house, and I could pay more attention about the story and the similarities that this movie has with ''The Lady and the Tramp'' and also ''101 dalmatians''. The ''Lady and the Tramp'' similarity is pretty obvious: The fact that Duchess is a high society cat, identical as ''Lady'' and O'Malley is from the streets like Tramp, as well as the last scene where all the cats are together as a family and Adelaide takes a picture of them together. From the ''101 dalmatians'', The delivery van in ''The Aristocats'' is similar to the moving van in ''101 Dalmatians'', as well as the pets being stolen for the pet napper's benefit and Napoleon, a dog that seems very similar to another dog from ''101 Dalmatians''.The story is a little bit silly, in the sense of Adelaide leaving all her money to her cats a little bit ridiculous, but since it is a cartoon made for kids, we should not judge it so much. And a very cool thing: everything is hand-drawn!The plot: In 1910 France,a retired opera singer Adelaide Bonfamille, is a very rich woman who lives in a mansion with her cats( Duchess and her three kittens Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse) and her butler called Edgar. One day, when Adelaide wants to settle her will with her lawyer, she decides to leave all her money to her cats, since she doesn't have family.The problem is that Edgar hears that,and wanting the fortune for himself, he decides to get a rid of the cats, leaving them away from their home. Edgar's plan is not totally successful, since he is attacked by dogs, but he lets Duchess and the kittens in the middle of nowhere. When Duchess meets a friendly stray cat named Thomas O'Malley,a romance between them begins, and also a journey, since Thomas will help Duchess and her kittens at any cost to go back to their home."
16,The Aristocats,10,13 May 2011,A Must See Film. Witty. Charming.,"Perhaps one of the most underrated of all Disney films.The butler overhears madame's conversation of leaving everything in her will to her cats, but only after they are gone he will receive everything she possesses, not willing to wait this long he decides to dispense of the cats. After waking under a bridge from what they thought was a horrible nightmare, they realise it wasn't but they set off to get back to their madame which is some distance away. They quickly bump into a unfamiliar but charming alley cat who guides them to their destination, meeting some amusing characters along the way.All the characters and voices are simply fantastic, while the movie is surprisingly witty throughout, with a character for everyone to love and relate to. There are funny quotes throughout the film and even matched by great songs which you will be humming hours after seeing the film."
17,The Aristocats,,9 October 1999,Disney's Weakest Animated Feature,"There could be some debate as to which of the Walt Disney Company's weakest animated films, Robin Hood and Aristocats is the worst.  For me, I vote for this film, The Aristocats.  At least Robin Hood had a few moments of fine verbal wit, at least one good song and wonderful character designs that has inspired a generation of furry fans to their own creations.The Aristocats, however offers nothing like that.  Its plot is a feline mishmash rip-off of One Hundred and One Dalmations and Lady and The Tramp, both infinitely superior films to this effort. The main villian, Edgar the Butler, has none of the suave and menace of Cruella De Vil.  As with the film, he continually pulls his punches as to the harm he intends to his victims and comes off as a wimp and a one note character.  As John Grant notes in ""The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney Animated Characters"", unlike Cruella De Vil, whose goals are relatively reasonable in a twisted fashion; Edgar is simply too stupid and short sighted to realize that he would be sure to have guaranteed job security as the cats' caretaker before he inevitably inherits the fortune himself.  Thus his whole rationale comes off as greedy stupidity to gain something that will be effectively his, albeitwith some responsiblities, sooner than the will would suggest.  If a good film often needs a good antagonist, then this films fails to deliver on that requirement.  Instead, he comes as if played by a respected actor stumbling about desperately trying to make the best of a bad role in a pathetic script.Also damaging the film is the clear artistic laziness.  Phil Harris' character is simply Baloo of the Jungle Book transplanted as a cat and numerous animation cycles (reused animation sequences) are prevalent in the film from 101 Dalmations to name at least one.  That is far below the artist standards Walt Disney demanded and the story is not strong enough to compensate for the cheapened animation as in 101 with its cycles.In short, while this film may be entertaining for kids;  adult fans of animation shouldn't waste their time."
18,The Aristocats,9,6 February 2013,One of Disney's good animated works,"This is apparently the last film project to be approved by Mr. Walt Disney and I think he would have been proud of it because even after his death they knew how to remain faithful to his style. This thanks to the Nine Old Men and their long experience with ""Uncle Walt"".The movie is utterly charming although, I have to admit, it isn't perfect and it also has a silly side to it. The silly side is the fact that the cats are going to heir Madame's fortune. I mean, what use animals would have of money? No matter how clever they are, animals are animals. They don't know what money is and they don't understand the concept of money.Having that said, Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is a loving, kind-hearted eccentric old lady and if you don't take the mentioned silly side of the film too seriously (and it's important not to), it makes for a very rewarding movie experience.Many characters are great fun. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is not only a very nice old lady but also funny. The very elderly and eccentric lawyer Georges Hautecourt is truly amusing, I wish more elderly people could be as playful as him. The butler Edgar is much fun either, except when he goes crazy and his intentions become darker at the ending. The hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are so stupid that they are hilarious. Uncle Waldo is unquestionably one of the most hilarious characters  despite his short role, he is such a delight. Roquefort (the mouse) and Frou Frou (the horse) are funny in their own way.The movie has high-quality artwork, originality, great lines and delightful voices from the acting business such as Roddy Maude-Roxby, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Charles Lane, Sterling Holloway, Vitto Scotti, Paul Winchell, Pat Buttram, Bill Thompson and Thurl Ravenscroft.Title in Portugal: 'Os Aristogatos'."
19,The Aristocats,,23 October 2002,One of Walt Disney Pictures weakest and worst animated films ever,"The legendary Walt Disney himself had accepted the production of the screenplay for this feeble 1970 animated film for release at his studio but he died before he could get a chance to supervise its production. Some of the animators and script editors were probably lost without him and the end result is a supremely weak film with boring characters, not so catchy jazz songs and a convoulted and implausible plot. This mix of several earlier Walt Disney Pictures animated films loses focus and doesn't stand in the same league as the studio's animated classics. Not the worst of Walt Disney Pictures or of animated films but nowhere even close to among the best or even decent either."
20,The Aristocats,5,4 October 2017,Boring.,"The older I get, the more I realise how boring and lazy this Disney feature. I am not saying that it is plain bad, but it really is forgettable. The only thing about it I really enjoyed was the ""Everybody Wants to Be a Cat"" scene and Thomas O'Malley's song. Okay, when Edgar meets these dogs, things get a little exciting, but that's it. It also has one of Disney's most dull and forgettable villains in the greedy butler Edgar. Not to talk about the many of the other side characters, which are merely shown one time in the film and then oddly appears at the very end to sing ""Everybody..."". Not that the characters are all just bad or unlikeable, they are just forgettable. I felt bored by listening to their voices.Definitely not one of my favorite Disney features."
21,The Aristocats,,29 August 2016,The alley cats rock,"The Ariosto cats is a hilarious tale about a cat named Maria along with her kittens who are kidnapped by the butler and now must make it home with the help of an alley cat named o'mallyIn a lot of ways it reminds me of 101 Dalmatians from art work, animals being involved with worried owners, the butler and he even crashed his mo pad in a river.This cation seems to mix a few genres successfully. The two cats fall in love Paris style. Comedy from the hi-jinks the butler will go to get the animals only to fail. Drama from being ripped away from their elderly lonely owner and horror at what lengths human nature will go. The music is enchanting from classical romantic synthetic music to back street jamboree.The voice work had real talent like Phil Harris and Eva Harbor who provide great life, pose and unique charm to the roles.Not the best Disney feature ever made, but its a great way to kill an hour.6/10"
22,The Aristocats,6,27 April 2016,The end of Walt's legacy.,"Enjoyable for what it is, ""The AristoCrats"" simply for me brings back memories of seeing it when it first came out. I recalled the rather pretentious butler, Edgar, the kindly madame (who still looked like Cinderella's step-mother even if she was sweet), the fatherless kittens of ""Duchess"" and all the other assorted animals who came in and out of the slight story-two pranksterish country hounds, two overly helpful but ultimately bossy geese, a suspicious horse, a lovable mouse, and of course the various alley cats of all backgrounds who had a penchant for Le Jazz Hot. Seen 46 years later, it took me back to the small neighborhood theater that my parents dropped my siblings and I off at for 90 minutes while they went grocery shopping, and the line-up of Disney re-releases, this one being in first run and the others accompanying it as part of a children's matinée theater festival.Sweet sounding Eva Gabor is the lovable and classy Duchess whose three kittens look as if they could all have had different dads. Where the father is never is explained, and when Phil Harris joins their group after nasty Edgar dumps the cat family in the French countryside, it is obvious that Gabor has romance on her mind with this new potential Popsicle. Edgar has overheard Madame indicate that her money will go to her cats with him as executor, and in order to get his hands on her money faster decides to dispose of the cat family. With his tiny little hat popping off his huge, fat head every time his motorcycle has a back-fire, Edgar takes them out of Paris, looses them thanks to the chasing of the hound dogs, and must return when he realizes that there is evidence which could expose his plot. By this time, the cats are on their way back to Paris with the help of the very Irish Harris, and they meet up with his pals, led by Scatman Crothers' ""Scat Cat"" who leads a bunch of alley cats in the big musical number ""Everybody Wants to Be a Cat"".Going from pooh bear to tiny house mouse, Sterling Holloway is a lovable little rodent who is good friends with the classy felines and goes out of his way to find them and expose the nasty Edgar. He even risks being eaten, and that makes him perhaps the most endearing of all the non-cat animals. ""Beverly Hillbillies"" co-star Nancy Kulp's voice is recognizable as the horse whom Edgar naively confesses his scheme to, and there are other familiar voices as well. Disney as a studio would continue to make animated films over the next decade, and other than just being moderate hits, nothing of great importance would come along until they decided to musicalize some children's classics. But as Disney's last personally supervised animated film, ""The AristoCats"" was a footnote after 33 years of feature films that the master had his finger on. Every great Disney film needs a great villain, and in the case of the pompous Edgar, he's more of a comic buffoon than a truly evil human. He certainly gets his come-uppance, but he's basically just a gay version of Cruella de Vil from ""101 Dalmations"" and not really all that threatening when compared to the Wicked Queen, Wicked Stepmother, Malificent or later scary villains like Ursula, Jafar and Hades. This probably plays better for children than it does adults, being rather silly and juvenile in spots, but does have a few adult references that might go over the heads of pre-teen children yet be picked up instantly by grown-ups. It was great going down memory lane again with one of the few Disney animated films that I saw during its initial run, but I believe that this won't be on my repeat viewing list."
23,The Aristocats,8,30 April 2014,Charming for most kids but a few jarring notes for adults,"This is a pretty well-crafted film for the young and uncritical watcher, full of amusing characters, and with a villain who is not particularly scary or evil; he's almost just a victim of circumstances. I'm glad that so many people have enjoyed this film without reservations and remember it fondly. Coming to a first viewing as an adult, there were points that gave me pause.For a story set in France there seem to be rather few characters who sound French-- but I suppose the idea is that American children will more readily connect with familiar accents. Eva Gabor's elegantly Continental Duchess seems right at home, but somehow her kittens turned out pure USA. Well, these aren't the things that matter to kids.It's too bad that the period setting wasn't developed further; the music in many period pieces is inoffensively anachronistic, but putting jazz into 1910, at the height of the ragtime era, seems like a wasted opportunity. It wouldn't have been too hard to concoct a fun gang of cats who played snappy rags.Giving the 'hepcats' identities largely through nationality isn't so bad (again, not many French in this Paris), but the 'Chinese' cat?!! I know other reviewers must have commented on this notorious racial faux pas. 'Shun Gon' appears to be a Siamese, but with the squinty eyes, buck teeth and broken English more typical of a wartime anti-Japanese propaganda cartoon. He even plays piano with chopsticks, just in case we hadn't already gotten the joke about those quaint, funny Far-East types. Evidently at the Disney studio, even in 1970, all Asians were alike-- and were caricatures. How could any major organization based in California be so oblivious to the presence and feelings of the many Chinese, Japanese and Thai Californians, not to mention those living elsewhere? For shame! At least 'Shun Gon' has little closeup screen time, though his lyrics in ""Everybody Wants to Be a Cat"" are memorably lame orientalisms: ""Shanghai, Hong Kong, Egg Foo Yong! Hya ha ha ha ha ha! Fortune cookie always wrong! Hya ha ha!"" Well, enough about that.As an animated feature rather than a cartoon, the world of ""The Aristocats"" largely functions close to the real laws of physics, so it seemed a startling departure when the overtaxed piano at Scat Cat's jam session falls through the floor, and then each successive floor below before coming to rest. I hope that was a deserted building! (with a harp in it?) Who'd be repairing the damage? Luckily O'Malley would soon be moving out.Then there's dear Madame; she seems to have become unhinged by her experiences, for at the end she announces her intention of taking in EVERY STRAY CAT IN Paris. Yes, but-- Well, just picture it! And spaying/neutering wasn't the custom then; surplus kittens were simply put into a sack and drowned. But of course Madame wouldn't permit that. One tries to imagine the scene a few years hence...But still, for the young and uncritical watcher this is a film to enjoy. Why spoil it with too much grownup reality?"
24,The Aristocats,7,8 December 2013,A Cat's Tale!,"Walt Disney finally produced(before his untimely death) this delightful animated feature film that focuses on cats, as a rich Madame living in Paris in the early 20th century intends to leave her fortune to her beloved cat Duchess and her three kittens. Unfortunately, her greedy butler finds out about it, and so decides to ""catnap"" them, in order that he can inherit her wealth by default, but doesn't count on stray cat Thomas O'Malley to come to the rescue, along with his other animal friends, and give Edgar the butler the kick in the pants he deserves... Most appealing film that cat lovers will especially appreciate. True, the plot isn't that original or inspired, but filled with such good characters and songs like ""Everybody Want's To Be A Cat"" that it is of little consequence."
25,The Aristocats,7,5 November 2013,Amour,"The 1970's began and many classics got born that decade.Disney had Aristocats one of the many clips the Disney special here in Denmmark shows every Christmas.There are many memorable jazz era songs.Paris looks splendid as in reality.The usual evil butler are some of the highlights.Duchess and her kittens must go back to Paris after being taken away by the butler.Too much cuteness is the con of the movie.It's not any Fantasia, but just some lively and lighthearted entertainment.But if you and your family wants some animated entertainment for the weekend buy this movie.7/10"
26,The Aristocats,7,7 July 2013,"For the dog lovers we've got Lady & The Tramp,for the cat lovers we've got this and Oliver & Company","The Aristocrats is Disney's 20th Animated Disney Cannon from the House Of Mouse and tells the tale of a débutante who pretty well off as she has a cat called Duchess(voiced by Eva Gabor)who goes missing along with her three kittens as their owner's evil butler wants to dispose of them so that he can get the money(yeah you could say he is related to Cruella De Vil in a way). Along the way and Duchess meets a charming ladies man called Thomas O Malley(Phil Harris who I think voiced Babloo in The Jungle Book back in 1966 the year Walt Disney died)an alley cat who stumbles across Duchess and her three kittens and together the three go back to Paris to find Duchess's owner again.So do I like this movie; well the music is pretty similar to the 2009 49th Animated flick The Princess & The Frog which has jazz music too but that was set in 1920s New Orleans,The Aristocrats was set in Paris 1910(yeah JAZZ music in Paris; I had no idea that Jazz music was in Paris France till this came out).Overall I found this movie to be good. Is it the best animated movie of all time NO,but is it a timeless classic YES it is,but its not my personal favourite. So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10.The music: 4/5 The Plot: 3/5 (cause it reminded me of the cat version of Lady & The Tramp). Voice Acting: 4/5"
27,The Aristocats,7,29 April 2013,The AristoCats,"A Paris-setting Disney traditional animation from 1970, THE ARISTOCATS does present a foreign-looking style of a 2-dimensional continental outlook and tell us a not-so-adventurous little vignette of a fairytale, a personification of animals (cats, dogs, a rat, a horse and geese), the story is about a gentrified quartet of pet cats (a mother with her three offering), who are outcast into the wild by a reprobate butler since they are in his way to inheritance of a wealthy Madame (the pets' owner). Soon they will meet their alleycat counterpart, a very gentleman-like one (male, of course), they enjoy a stint of adventures and a great big band revelry, then return home and sabotage the butler's scheme, easy and simple. Running within a succinct 78 minutes, this animation epitomises nearly every trademark of Disney, a children-prone narrative, an illuminating storyline, adorably main characters with quirky sidekicks, cartoony villains and most significantly an unerringly happy ending. But what's more conspicuous in this Walt Disney's last output is the music renditions, French chanson led by Maurice Chevalier's title song from the opening credits, marches with classical-adaptive show tunes and bookends with a Jazz-infused razzle-dazzle, all is done in nifty set pieces and nimble workmanship. Also the benign caricatures of bourgeois French (for example, the mother cat keeps claiming they're more than pets to their Madame, who will be totally alone in the world without them, although it may be the truth, but her tone of snobbish does niggle me quite a bit) and gormless British (the twin geese and their uncle) are simultaneously entertaining and cringeworthy. The voice cast is mellifluously solid, my own pick is Scatman Holloway's Scat Cat (a reincarnation and tribute of Louis Armstrong), while the action sequences between the butler and the two bandit dogs (Napoleon and Lafayette) are the high moment of the film, idiotic, yes, but masterfully concocted and slickly edited nonetheless, which nowadays has been substituted by grandiose spectacles in the mainstream animation branch. So, for me ruefully it has been too late to watch this film for the first time at my awkward adult age, it is pure fun but the aftertaste is also fun-sized, no soul-searching commentary could be extracted, after all, it is a bona fide Disney fare, it you dig the franchise, for sure you will like it."
28,The Aristocats,,28 December 2012,Entertaining 1970s vintage Disney animated movie set in Paris.,"I got this one on Blu-ray from my public library. It is entertaining fluff, essentially a series of cartoon-like scenes to support the central story of a family of aristocratic cats in a wealthy Paris family. It was good to hear the familiar voices of such old-time stars as Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Scatman Crothers, and ventriloquist Paul Winchell.The family of cats live with their elderly owner who is re-writing her will. The old faithful butler overhears part of the conversation with her lawyer, on her death the whole estate will go to her cats, and after they die then the butler will inherit everything.The butler cannot stand the thought of waiting 12 years for them to die, plus their ""nine lives"", so this being a Disney movie, he plots to have them disappear to the countryside, and then he will be the sole heir.Most of the movie is their road trip of sorts, assisted by a nice male alley cat, back to Paris and their mansion. Along the way they get into a number of close calls. Meanwhile the butler has to go back to the drop point to retrieve his hat and umbrella, clues that could lead the police to him.Fun to see this ""blast from the past""."
29,The Aristocats,6,2 December 2012,Purr-ty good,"Yet another pleasant if less than original Disney animation family entertainment, with instead of 101 Dalmatians we get four cute cats (plus one) on the run, trying to escape the machinations of a nefarious butler who sees his way to a rich inheritance blocked by his rich mistress's preference for her cats over him.The déjà-vu feelings kick in even more with the familiar Disney vocal talents of Phil (Baloo) Harris, Eva Gabor and even Scatman Crothers taking prominence, plus even the background music has shades of ""Baby Elephant Walk"" and ""The Pink Panther"" at times, while themain ""rough with the smooth"" romance of O'Malley the alley-cat and posh-paws Duchess looks back to the studio's own ""The Lady And The Tramp"".As ever there are cute scenes involving the three kittens and a friendly mouse, some entertaining chase scenes, a nick-of-time rescue and of course a happy ending. The music is fine, especially the two big tunes ""O'Malley The Alley-Cat"" and ""Everybody Wants To Be A Cat"", which gets a full jazz work-out courtesy of Crothers and band. There's even a touch of topical psychedelic colouring at one point.The animation is mostly fine, especially the depiction of famous Parisian landmarks although I detected some issues with speech-synchronisation. But yet again, Disney studios prove themselves purveyors of pleasant animated feature-fun, even if I wouldn't rank ""The Aristocats"" as best in show."
30,The Aristocats,,11 January 2000,For kids to enjoy. And it's cool!,"> Kids will love this movie, just as they should. But, actually I thought it was cool! The characters and the music (ScatCat rocks) are fantastic to listen to, and the soundtrack is to be recommended.An old lady makes her beloved cats the owner of her money, in her will. Her clumsy butler, Edgar, finds this idea very stupid and annoying. And a problem, since he was certain that the money would go to him. So, wise as he is, he decides to get the cats out of the picture, so he can get all the cash. Of course. He grabs them in a rainy night and throw them away in a swamp way outside the city in France.Can't be missing in your Disney-collection."
31,The Aristocats,4,19 October 2007,"Fine Disney animation at odds with slapstick treatment, mundane script...","A French feline and her three kittens are cat-napped by the scheming butler of a wealthy Parisian Madame; enter a ""hep cat"" from the wrong side of the tracks. 1962's independently-produced ""Gay Purr-ee"" was groovier, and Disney's own ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""101 Dalmatians"" covered this ground (with dogs) with much more spirit--not to mention better songs--so ""The Aristocats"" was already second-best on three counts: story, presentation and music. The movie is at odds with itself over how far to go with its comedy: at one point, the butler on his motorcycle drives into the base of a windmill and moves the structure a few feet before crashing through the other side. It's Saturday morning TV slapstick, lumpy with comic relief that might only tickle indiscriminating children. ** from ****"
32,The Aristocats,5,8 April 2010,Not one of the better Disney animation efforts...,"The Aristocats...not very entertaining for adults, although the kids may like it...and that's most likely what Disney folk had in mind. This one is very lame and lacks spark and imagination. Un-inspired...and un-inspiring. The animation..and the backgrounds..are almost completely run of the mill. The plot...predictable. You've seen it all before..and heard it before. But even a fairly decent cast can't elevate this up from being anything more than a piece of Disney tripe, and it's way below par in overall quality to its other out-pourings. I found it extremely boring. Recommended for the kiddies, perhaps...if you are an adult, find a good book to read instead."
33,The Aristocats,10,10 June 2012,Such an adorable film,"This movie was just so unbelievably adorable! All the characters from this film were just so cute and endearing, I loved them all. The animated movies done by the Disney company during the sixties and the seventies were both cute and funny (And quite underrated as well) and this movie wasn't the exception, being one of my favorite movies from all the time. It was incredibly enjoyable from beginning to end.The animation was quite good, with beautiful sceneries and a pleasant character design. It also have catchy songs and nice music. All those qualities are enough to make this film a delightful experience for the whole family.An underrated classic film from Disney, that deserves way more appreciation and love."
34,The Aristocats,7,6 October 2017,fun and light old school,"It's pre-war Paris. Duchess is a well groomed cat with three kittens; Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse. Man servant Edgar overhears their loving elderly owner Madame Adelaide Bonfamille changing her will. She plans to leave her estate to the cats with Edgar as her heir after the cats' death. He decides to abandon the cats in the country. Stray cat Thomas O'Malley falls for Duchess and leads the family back to Paris.The song and music is big band and jazzy. It's the waning years of old school Disney animation. It is fun and light but lacks any long-lasting drama. The old school feel fits the time period and setting of the story. It doesn't have the big iconic tune although a couple of them are pretty catchy. The cats are cute. Edgar is a functional villain but the movie needs a more immediate villain in the middle while he is separated from the cats. There should be an animal villain hunting the family to heighten the drama. There is a stretch between being abandoned and returning to face Edgar where the movie lacks any tension. In any case, the movie has a good nature light fluffiness that is quite appealing."
35,The Aristocats,6,15 March 2016,Everybody Wants to be a Cat.,"The Aristocats (1970): Dir: Wolfgang Reitherman / Voices: Eva Gabor, Phil Harris, Scatman Crothers, Sterling Holloway, Roddy Maude-Roxby: Animation about class and a family of cats left with a Paris estate by their millionaires owner. Edgar the greedy butler doesn't much care for this news so he kidnaps the feline family and abandons them in the country. Duchess the feline mother and her three daring children are eventually joined by an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley. Simple plot and very undemanding with a slapstick violent climax common in these films. One must question the mental stability of a person who leaves her estate to animals. Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman with dazzling colorful animation. Eva Gabor voices Duchess, whom like any mother cares for her children and their safety. Phil Harris voices Thomas O'Malley who is a rather simple character with an uplifting attitude that churns romantic vibes at Duchess. Scatman Crothers voices Scat Cat who leads his Jazz playing band of cats that sing ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat."" He will be recruited by O'Malley to fight against Edgar. Sterling Holloway voices a loyal mouse whom assists the cats. Roddy Maude-Roxby voices the villain butler Edgar who provides some humour with his downfall. Simplistic and flat yet colorful Disney animation about family with wit, charm and a touch of class. Score: 6 / 10"
36,The Aristocats,8,1 March 2016,Sweet without being to saccharine and romantic without being too mawkish,"NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Lizz Rutter for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It."" Disney's The Aristocats is such a charming, almost compelling story that I wished the narrative didn't need to interrupt itself so sporadically with jazz-fueled musical numbers amongst not only cats, but dogs and a variety of other animals. The musical interjections, that push this Disney film over the edge into being a full-blown musical like most of their films in this respective era, unfortunately disrupts the magic these feline characters manage to conjure up when they are just trying to sift their way through their poor circumstance.The result, as one can expect, is a film that you say ""aww"" to over a dozen times and a film that has you either tapping your foot or rocking your legs in melodic harmony with the music. The Aristocats is a simplistic story, concerning a wealthy woman named Madame Adelaide (voiced by Hermione Baddeley) in 1910 Paris that has just signed a will granting her lavish estate to her cat Dutchess (Eva Gabor) and her three kittens. This move greatly upsets her jealous, hot-headed English butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), who has slaved away at serving Madame Adelaide for years and has ostensibly gotten nothing in return. As a result, Edgar conjures up a plan to get rid of the cats so when Adelaide dies, he can inherit the estate. He rounds up the four cats and throws them into the street, where the four homebody felines must learn to survive in order to be reconnected with their Madame.On the long, rainy, and uncertain road back home, Duchess meets a gentle feral cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who has been living off the land for many years. O'Malley is kind to Duchess, as he recognizes their predicament, but most important to note is how well he responds to her kittens, playing with them and assisting them whenever they need it. Both him and Duchess strike up an affable relationship as the gang tries to get back home, but not without a few musical numbers slowing them down along the way.The Aristocats, in a strange way, could almost be seen as a parable for single parent-dating or ""getting back out there,"" especially for a woman who has children, which is no easy process. The film showcases such a challenge with admirable conviction and a willingness to have long stretches without musical numbers or any kind of distractions in order to allow this relationship to build. For an animated film in the modern day, even some of the best ones stamped with the Disney or Disney Pixar approval can't help but feel a bit scatterbrained in some sense, stepping over their toes to try and cover all the bases in subplots, character relations, and cause-and-effect relationships that are questionably worthy of being a focus in said film.The Aristocats was birthed in a time when animation took a more relaxed and reserved approach, which is why we could see Duchess, O'Malley, and Duchess's kittens do everything from hop aboard a train to meet two snobby swans in a river below a bridge. This kind of fluid, real-time focus on the characters makes the process and narrative development all the more natural. Of course, the film cuts back to Madame Adelaide desperately trying to find her cats, along with Edgar's conniving plan to make sure the furry beasts will never come home, and the jazzy musical numbers occasionally get in the way of a film that's already extremely short (a mere seventy-eight minutes). However, nothing truly distracts from The Aristocats being simple, effervescent entertainment with a plethora of fun characters, a timely moral, and, okay, some pretty catchy jazz numbers as well.Voiced by: Edna Gabor, Phil Harris, Hermione Baddeley, and Roddy Maude-Roxby. Directed by: Wolfgang Reitherman."
37,The Aristocats,9,14 October 2015,Great Moarls and Great Movie,"The movie, ""The AristoCats"", is a fantastic movie for your young one to watch when you just need sometime off. Not only will the love the characters, the setting, and the many animals, it also builds up good ideas in their minds. It gives the idea of staying mentally strong, compatibility with others, and resilience against difficult situations. The cats are drugged, and then thrown out into the river left to drown. With all this hardship, Duchess, the mother cat, keeps her ducks in a row and makes sure that her family is safe. She keeps herself strong and gives to others who are important to her. Her family and her own welfare is the most important thing to her. This could have effect on your children, building the mentality that it is important to stay strong when the going gets rough.Our little family they will need to trust others to keep themselves safe. Of course, we don't want your kid running off with a stranger when they are lost, but it may be a way to talk to your kids about talking to strangers. This little family of cats, each and everyone, must be resilient against their hardship. They all have to show compassion and strength towards each other to keep everyone together. By keeping themselves strong, they keep each other strong."
38,The Aristocats,9,14 October 2015,The Aristocats,"The movie The Aristocats is great movie. Its the theme is mostly adventure. There is the mom Duchess with her three little children Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz. Edgar the butler, makes them fall asleep with some medicine. Then proceeds to take them away but in the process drops them trying to escape some dogs. The basket of cats falls near a stream by the bridge. Once awoken they hid in the basket, while it rains. I'm the morning they meet Thomas O'Malley. He agreed to help them get to Paris. Other than helping them, Tomas saved the children a few times from being left behind, drowned, or falling off of something. When they were getting close to Paris they started liking each other more. Duchess was sad she could not bring him but Madame would be worried. My analysis is that this is an perfect example of how good is at work in this greedy world. It also gives an example of that a very kind person would help. But in real life there are very few people that would do that. Most people would be like the butler and throw the kittens out just so they could inherit some money. It an example of the trials of life. The cats have to go thought some complicated stuff to get to Paris but they also make some great memories. I really think this is a good movie it has a lot of hidden messages that different people will get out of it. It's so kind how some they meat would help them and show them parts of the world they haven't seen"
39,The Aristocats,7,28 February 2015,Not the usual Disney instant classic.,"Think: feline version of LADY and the TRAMP. Usual entertaining Disney animation feature; but not the instant classic as so many during Walt Disney's lifetime. (I believe this is the first completed feature following his death.) Grand, beautiful and pampered pussy Duchess(Eva Gabor)leaves all her earthly possessions to her three kittens in her will.(Duchess might have really made the rounds by looking at her three different looking offspring.) A clause states whats left of the fortune goes to the butler Edgar(Roddy Maude-Roxby)in the event the cats don't survive. Greedy Edgar dumps them out in the country in hopes they will never find their way back home. But coming to their aid is alley cat Thomas O'Malley(Phil Harris).ARISTOCATS is family fun with high quality cinematography and directed by Wolfgang Reitherman. Maurice Chevalier sings the title song. And Harris sings a tune called ""Thomas O'Malley Cat"". A diverse group of actors lend their voices to supplement the cast: Sterling Holloway, Pat Buttram, Nancy Culp, George Lindsay, Scatman Crothers, Lord Tim Hudson and Hermoine Baddeley."

They have to find their way back home to Paris with the help of an alley cat named O'Malley.At the beginning of the movie, I was thinking that the animation was not as good in this one compared to some of the earlier ones.There were some great characters and some really funny moments. My favourite characters were Napoleon & Lafayette. They were funny.Some of the voice talents were recognisable instantly. Phil Harris & Sterling Holloway were the main 2 that I recognised straight away. Phil has done a lot of Disney voices... but i think his most famous was Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book. Sterling has also done a lot of voices, but I think his most famous is Winnie the Pooh.I also really like Pat Buttram's voice... he has done a few voices and every time I recognise his voice and it makes me laugh.The songs in this film are OK... they are not really as catchy as some of the other classic songs. But they got my feet tapping.I will give this film 6 out of 10.It is a good movie, but there was not really anything memorable in it. It felt like it was missing some of the Disney magic that is critical in a Disney Classic.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204"
42,The Aristocats,,20 October 2011,A funny video with music and entertainment,"Another great Disney classic, with animals and humans interacting in funny ways. And of course the plot, which involved missing cats! Wouldn't you know... the butler did it! What a surprise, haha. It's so stereotypical. I loved the humor presented, the indication throughout the movie that the alley cat fell in love with the mother cat... the kids interactions with them and the geese I thought were annoying actually. But then the uncle who was drunk came along and was amusing. I liked those dogs who did their best to stop the butler on several occasions, and of course the alley cats who played the fun music.This is one of those types of movies where there's no swearing or sex and it's just a fun family classic. It's too bad that the movies these days are quite opposite.Rated 7/10."
43,The Aristocats,,12 October 2011,Everybody - in this movie - wants to be a cat!,"I think that this is based on a French story but I know neither the title nor the story itself.Never before in this world have I ever seen such a loved and overprotected family of cats! Their wealthy owner is a former opera singer and she is almost never seen not holding and obsessing over them wherever she is! She can never stop cuddling them - even while dancing with an admirer! ""Meow, meow!"" they should say (in English ""put me down, woman!""). She is madly obsessed with her cats and it doesn't end there... she even inherits her will to the cats! What would they benefit from lots and lots of money, being pets? It isn't just Madame who has this burning obsession of the cats; there's Frou-Frou the horse and even a MOUSE, for heaven's sake! Those cats are treated like and are regarded as royalty! Now I think people are too hard on the film's 'villain' Edgar the butler; he is overjoyed to hear that Madame will inherit her fortune to him - until he hears that the cats will get the money first and and poor Edgar is dismayed, especially knowing he'll die long before the family does. Like I said, how will a fortune benefit cats? He plans to catnap them and later drown them - how could he turn the idea down when it's so easy to accomplish?! Even if it is done out of greed? He doesn't drown them thanks to the antics of a duo of hound dogs and so begins the classy Duchess and her three fiery kittens' adventure as they find their way back home. Along the way, they meet Abraham de Lasey Guisuppe Casey Thomas O'Malley, a lovable alley-cat who falls tail over heels for Duchess, two well-to-do English geese whose constant hysterical laughter never fails to cheer me up on a blue day and Abraham de Lacey Giusppe Casey Thomas O'Malley's best friend Scat Cat and his gang of alley-cats. What will Edgar do when he is dismayed to find that the cats managed to return home? You'll have to watch and find out because this movie is fun and vivacious! Full of sentiment, laughter, adventure and jazzy music... ""I'm ready maestraw!"" Ha ha, I find that so funny. The female kitten Marie says it and it's just such an iconic quote.Certified U and suitable for children of all ages with no violence, sex/nudity or bad language - 100% clean!I'm the reviewer! I'll decide when the it's the end of the review... it's the end of the review! Ha ha!"
44,The Aristocats,8,20 January 2011,A Little Film with Huge Hopes to Please Anyone,"The film's story is very simple. A retired singing woman decides that when she dies, she will give her enormous fortune to her cats. Her butler Edgar isn't too happy with this and he cat naps the cats and leaves them in a ditch. A wise street cat later helps Dutchess and her small kittens to get back home safely. Nice and sound..... Not if Edgar can help it XD.Definitely one of my favorite Disney films. All the acting voices are well done, the story is short and sweet and the atmosphere of the film's premise is good at times as it changes.I've always got a favorite character in a Disney film and mine would be Edgar because he's a smart idiot who has been triggered to being a victim of not getting the enormous fortune. People see him as a villain but I see him as something else. He's greedy.All sums up. 8.3/10"
45,The Aristocats,,27 August 2006,"Problematic, But It's Still a Delight","The death of Walt Disney was the end of an era in the history of the animation medium. With the success of ""The Jungle Book"" in the fall of 1967, Disney was confident to keep going with animation. Animation was on its way out by the late 1960s, as Disney was regarded as ""kid's stuff"", and adults didn't want to attend an animated feature because they considered it an equivalent of a childish Saturday morning cartoon.""The Aristocats"", the first post-Walt animated feature, shows that Disney decided to make animated films and make money, regardless of the quality. This element also plagued other Disney animated films of the era (with the exception of ""The Rescuers""). It wouldn't turn around until animation made its comeback in the mid-to-late 1980s.""The Aristocats""'s plot takes from ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" and tries to wade through its runtime. Fortunately, it's entertaining and delightful to watch, but it's no masterpiece.The butler of an aging woman named Madame Bonfamille worries that he will die before he inherits her fortune. In her will, it is stated that he shall look after her cats (Duchess and her kittens, Berlioz, Toulouse and Marie) until they die, and then he'll inherit the fortune. So he decides to drug the cats and dump them in the countryside.Duchess and kittens meet Thomas O'Malley (a happy-go-lucky alley cat played by Phil Harris), and from there, they go on an adventure back to Madame's mansion. Cue the ""Lady and the Tramp""/""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" similarities.The best scenes are when the gang meets Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers) and his gang of musical alley cats. The ""Everybody Wants To Be A Cat"" is the best sequence in the film, and it becomes a colorful jazzy explosion. Afterwards, it's a rushed race to the finish.""The Aristocats"" is fun to watch, but it's no masterpiece. The story is very weak, and the animation is solid but not anything special. It's a film that lack ambition or confidence, but it's sure to entertain the younger set. For adults and animation historians, it's a weak film.An 8.2 out of 10."
46,The Aristocats,,1 November 2000,"Weak, but kinda cool","Try watching this not as a ""Disney cartoon"" but on a slightly different level, and it's got some brilliant stuff. Very weak plotwise, and dragged out a little too long, but Duchess is by far the most sophisticated Disney mother animal I've ever seen. She's a swinging single, nobody's pushover, flirty and not quite maternal - not nearly as naive as Lady/Perdita. Some of the dialogue is quite funny, especially that of Edgar the Butler. The scene with Uncle Waldo (the drunk goose) was one of the funniest I've seen in a ""children's"" cartoon."
47,The Aristocats,5,26 October 2010,Disney's Death Knell,"Following Walt Disney's death, the studio was left rather lost as to  how to proceed. Though Disney relied on many deeply talented story  artists, concept artists, animators, and the like, his input had been  so tightly woven into the storytelling in Disney's work that merely his  shifting focus to other projects had caused the films to suffer.  Following his death, all the producers and director Wolfgang Reitherman  could think to do was imitate what had worked in the past.  Thus, we have The Aristocats, a straight lift of story elements from  101 Dalmations and The Lady and the Tramp that forgot to steal any of  the heart or innovation from either. The story, detailing the exploits  of a bunch of cats who just want to laze about and inherit a lot of  money for doing nothing, is unique for one reason alone. Though there  are many Disney movies in which the villain is more likable than the  protagonist, The Aristocats is the only one that made actively root for  the villain for purely moral reasons. See, Edgar, our ""villainous""  Butler, tries to do away with the cats some old hag is going to leave  all her money to so that he, the man who worked under the crazy witch  his entire life, can get some goddamn compensation. A  slapstick-triggered hitch in his plan causes the cats to be left by a  river bank instead, whereupon they jump into action and immediately  whine and cloy for a while until Phil Harris comes by and gets them to  actually do something.  And then there's lots of lame episodes with forgettable side characters  that I barely remember that mainly serve to pad out the thin plot to  feature length. Such fun moments are fine when the character is  actually entertaining, but, alas there's very little of that here  (though Scatman Crothers is always fun to watch...er, hear). The songs  by the normally exemplary Sherman Bros. are fine, but I struggle to  recall even one lyric or melody as I type this out. Anyway, Edgar gets  shipped off to Timbuktu, Phil Harris gets groomed into an aristocrat  because there's no room for individuality in the upper classes, and we  leave wanting to trample those annoying cats into the ground on our way  out.  Perhaps it isn't an AWFUL film, but it's so hard to care for the  characters we're supposed to fret for that what transpires basically  leaves us feeling like robotic husks that'll pump money into the Disney  machine even if the actual auteur himself is long gone.  Despite my indifference to the project as a whole, I was surprised to  find a few points that worked. Edgar, for all his bumbling and lack of  intimidating qualities, is great fun as a character, with some  ingenious comic animation by Milt Kahl (those who consider him a cold,  technical animator should look at this neglected piece that really  shows off the man's sense of humor). I can't help wondering whether the  story would have worked a lot better from his point of view. Kahl also  animates the Lawyer character, who doesn't get much screen time but  steals every scene he's in. Unfortunately, the other Disney animators  don't impress as much. Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas, for all their  genius, really worked best when they had a good concept for a character  they could sink their teeth into. Their work here is technically adept,  but as empty as the prissy, vapid cats they're forced to work with.  There's really not much else to say. It's a safe, commercial work from  a studio trying to gather itself together after Disney's death.  Producers with far less vision began to grab hold of the animators,  cutting corners and cobbling together hackneyed concepts that would  make a buck and nothing else. There's not the amount of rampant copied  animation that there would be in the next Disney project, but the  opening credits (in which animation from the body is reused for no  reason other than cost cutting) is a grim sign of things to come.  I think it's around this point that American animation essentially dies  for years, and Disney's next project wouldn't help a bit."
48,The Aristocats,1,8 May 2016,"When Aristocats was made, Uncle Walt certainly turned in the grave.","I'll receive many fingers down, but I need to say that this is by far the worst traditional Disney animation ever. ""Oliver & Company"" (1988) and ""The Black Cauldron""(1985) seems like a ""Spirited Away"" in the side of Aristocats.The only good and inspired thing about Aristocats is the musical sequence ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"". Only this. Let's look at the rest:The characters are awfully dull. O'Malley is just a cat version of Tramp. Duchess is a sympathetic character though, but only she can't save the movie. The animation is just terrible, full of recycled scenes, and low quality xerography, compared with ""101 Dalmatians"" (1961) and ""Jungle Book""(1967). ""Robin Hood""(1973) also had a poor animation, but compensated this with a more entertaining and funny story to follow. But what's the story of Aristocats? It's a rip-off of ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""101 Dalmatians"" version cats. The plot is dull, full of random and unbearably tedious moments, like Edgar being chased by generic dogs, and the group of cats talking with annoying geese, that not even a child with 7 years would have the patience to finish watching. Do you remember Cruella Devil, a woman who wanted to kill 99 puppies Dalmatians for wear their skin? Yes, she's a true villain. But in Aristocats, we have Edgar, the most dumb villain I've ever seen in my life. Why the heck Edgar decided get rid of the cats BEFORE Madame Bonfamille die? And why the heck he gave sleeping pills to cats and went to a other place, when he simply could arrest all cats in a bag and drown them? With these questions, we can see how Edgar is a dumb villain and how fragile and nonsense is the script of this film."
49,The Aristocats,7,2 March 2008,The main characters are lot like people - only they are cats...,"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film. It mentions alcohol*, shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack ""tresspassing"" humans and it shows a male cat called (Abraham Delacy Gieuseppe Casi Thomas) O' Malley, fancying a female cat, in a surprisingly human and adult way.As a cartoon film - or just a film in general, I feel this is pretty good quality - the storyline and characters are especially good. The film (in general) is set in France and you meet a family of cats - the mother Duchess and her kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. You also meet the kind (rich) old woman who adores the cats, the butler Edgar and an old man (who has CLEARLY lost his marbles) called George. The kind old woman discusses her will with George and Edgar overhears that what he receives from the will he will have after the cats have it. He is INCREDIBLY cross with this - and has an evil scheme in mind...A very cute film for every age - enjoy ""Aristocats""!*Not including ""Basil the Great Mouse Detective"" and a few others maybe which I cannot think of at the moment."
50,The Aristocats,10,6 December 2007,Charming,"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. The characters are quite well-cast as well. I love listening to Eva Gabor's velvety voice, and there are so many others that are familiar from childhood and also fit the characters so well. It's really a movie about love, tolerance, good manners, and faithfulness. Who doesn't want their kids exposed to these values? It is a movie that I don't mind watching over and over, unlike Happy Feet where I couldn't watch the whole thing even once because it was so irritating. I wish production companies would move toward making movies more like this one."
51,The Aristocats,3,22 February 2008,Probably One of Disney's Worst Features,"This movie is disappointing on so many levels. Much like the more recent Ratatouille, it seems to be a children's film hijacked and saddled with a slew of themes and environments better suited for octogenarians. Even in 1970, I doubt there were many 5 year olds who ached for jazz-loving bohemian cats in belle epoch Paris. It is immediately apparent that the Disney folks (on their own for the first time since Walt croaked) were lost - it takes almost 8 or 9 minutes for ANYTHING even remotely interesting to a child to occur. A five year old will be ready to leave before the disc has been spinning more than a few minutes. And it never goes anywhere. It never really tugs your heartstrings and instead wallows in this strange slapstick humor that undermines the drama. Perhaps most disappointing is the quality of the animation. It sports a rough look - almost like they just took practice sheets and frantically turned them into cels. You can practically see the pencil lines appearing. Animation-wise, it's God-awful."
52,The Aristocats,,3 August 2015,Inferior mixture,"What would you get if you took both Lady and the Tramp and 101 Dalmatians, smashed them together and made it about cats to avoid being completely obvious about it. In a word, this movie. It has the pampered household pet meeting a scamp, it has animals being stolen for lucrative purposes, it has chases and hiding, it has a romantic moonlit night... it basically has all the good parts from both films, but because they're so obviously borrowed, you can't really get into it.The film has its upsides, though, certainly. It's a Disney film after all. The music for one is pretty sweet, with jazzy tunes and one true classic in Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat. Plus, the two main characters, Duchess and O'Malley, while painfully similar to Lady and the Tramp, are at least interesting to follow, whereas the three children have no personalities of their own, aside from one of them being a female.Furthermore, the film's plot is full of holes, the villain is one of the least interesting Disney villains I've ever seen, the film is nothing more than a sequence of uninteresting side characters met one after another, the conclusion has no stages and as a whole it simply lacks effort.The Aristocats is perfectly fine as a children's film. It's not offensive in any way, the animation is nice, the music is nice and there's no reason why your kids wouldn't love it. But, it's one of the few Disney films you cannot really sit through as an adult without any difficulty, especially if you've seen the two films it rips off."
53,The Aristocats,6,23 November 2014,Pretty Bland,"With the help of a smooth talking tomcat (Phil Harris), a family of Parisian felines set to inherit a fortune from their owner try to make it back home after a jealous butler kidnaps them and leaves them in the country.This film may have been great in its day, but it just does not hold up well. The plot is pretty basic (almost non-existent), the characters are just average, with the male lead being incredibly sexist (and the female lead somehow enjoying it). The father of the kittens is never explained, and leads the viewer to imagine the horrible circumstances that lead to their birth...The music is alright, and the voice talent is very good (with many returning for the superior ""Rescuers""). There is never a bad time for Scatman Crothers. But the film does not age that great, and if it were to be remade would require quite the makeover for Thomas O'Malley."
54,The Aristocats,6,17 May 2014,The beginning of the fall,"After Walt Disney's death from cancer in 1966, his studio had no clue what to do with itself. The unfortunate result of this confusion was the first film of the Disney Dark Age (1970-1988), The Aristocats (1970).Outside of Maurice Chevalier's song over the opening credits and the psychedelic insanity of ""Everybody Wants to be A Cat,"" this film is forgettable. The story feels like a retooled version of 101 Dalmatians (1961) with less interesting characters. And while Dalmatians possessed one of the greatest Disney villains of all time in Cruella, The Aristocats features what may be the worst Disney villain ever, Edgar the butler. The animation is poor, with every frame reeking of cheapness.An unpopular opinion to be sure, but there it is. And it's coming from someone who enjoyed the film as a child, showing that not all childhood favorites hold up. Unlike the other Disney films, this one really does look down on its audience, pandering to the kids every single moment."
55,The Aristocats,7,23 October 2013,"Upscale Disney movie, with a touch of romance.","This is the final full-length animated feature film that was given the nod from Walt Disney. A family of Parisian cats are set to inherit the fortune of a wealthy Madame, but was kidnapped by a jealous butler, who left the cats in the countryside. Trying to find their way back home, the family of four encounter an adventurous alley cat, who tries to help them return home and reclaim their fortune.The setting is very upscale, as aristocracy is emphasized in this film. The animation is not as colorful or vibrant as earlier Disney films, and the plot and story are not as exciting or intriguing; it has a slow, lazy feel and pace to it. But, there are some nice action scenes, including the part where the animals confront the butler. The romance between the Thomas O'Malley and Duchess cat characters have some great chemistry. My favorite scene is the ""Everybody Wants To Be A Cat"" song sequence - very catchy, jazzy and swinging of a performance! Overall, more of a slightly above average Disney film, but still a nice one for the family.Grade B"
56,The Aristocats,7,10 October 2013,"""It isn't Beethoven, mama, but it sure bounces!""","Berlioz said it right! Though this movie was not-by any means-the best movie Disney has come out with, it definitely had a sort of bounce to it that kept me until the end- even going to the extents of making me consider watching it again! Though the story line was rather linear and predictable, the events that transpired along the way, coupled with a lovable set of characters and some great tunes, kept things lively. However, if I was rating this movie for its characters and music alone, I'd have given it more then 7/10. The only real drawbacks to this otherwise wonderful film can be found in two main areas: The animation and the mediocre child singers. The animation was a bit sketchy throughout the movie, especially when it came to moments of action and close ups. I am aware, however, that this was originally created in the 70s, a time when the traditional, hand- drawn methods were prevalent. This does not excuse the artists behind the less than satisfactory performance, however, especially when it's compared to the stellar performance, say, of the Fox and the Hound and Bambi.Moving onDisney has a good reputation for some pretty amazing child singers, so I was disappointed by the ones in The Aristocats. Sure, they were excellent voice actors, but the same praise cannot be given to their singing, butchered further by the lower quality audio recordings of the time period. With that in mind, however, the adult singers in the movie were ear candy. But now, onto the good stuff!Maybe it was because of their diverse accents, but I must admit, each and every character, whether they be primary, secondary, or just tagging along for the ride, were portrayed amazingly. Though the majority of these characters were cut-and-paste stereotypes, their dialogue kept them afloat. With that in mind, however, there is some racial stereotyping, so if you're easily offended, don't watch this movie! Normally, I dislike static characters, but because their script was so cleaver and natural, I found myself laughing at their clichés instead of weeping, which is a good thing! Secondly, the music-heavily inspired by swing and jazz-was exceptional, and the song 'Everybody Wants to be a Cat' will most defiantly be stuck in my head for days to come. The overtures and subtle orchestral pieces residing or bridging each scene-living up to Disney's unprecedented standards-were top notch as well!And that concludes it! Enjoy, folks, and be cool.'If there be animals inside, expect a review!'~Mike"
57,The Aristocats,5,28 April 2013,1st out of 8 in the Dark Era,"Three years after the gigantic hit ""The Jungle Book"", Walt Disney's final green-lit animated movie was released, called ""The Aristocats"". This movie is the beginning of the era where the quality and impact of the animated films went downhill, known as the ""Dark Era"".The story is very basic. An aristocratic cat owner is planning her will and writes that all of her kittens will receive her money. The butler overheads this and kidnaps the cats to put them in the middle of nowhere. The cats then have to return home.The characters aren't annoying, but they are extremely boring and cutesy. Duchess is the classy, sophisticated mother cat, Thomas is the suave charmer and an alley cat, Duchess' children each have a talent; the red one can paint, the black one can play jazz music, and the white girl kitten can sing and is exactly like her mother. Edgar is the silliest villain to come out of Disney. The characters could have been extremely likable, but there is not enough time for their personalities to show and expand on.This soundtrack also has a jazz-like theme to it. Most of the songs are not that memorable, except for ""Everybody Wants to be A Cat"", which is a fun, catchy song. The title song does not really stand out, and ""Scales and Appegios"" is a cute song.Th xerography in this movie looks really bad. You see the sketch marks on every frame, and they don't even try to clean up and polish the sketchiness. Some of the characters movements Re very choppy, and the entire film looks extremely cheap. This is one of WDAS weakest animated films, but not the worst.With thin and boring plot and characters, one memorable song, and bad animation, this is one of the weaker movies in the canon. Adults and kids have a big chance of getting bored, but if you want a cutesy kids movie, this one you might like."
58,The Aristocats,10,2 February 2013,Wolfgang Reitherman's masterpiece,"When it comes to Disney animation, everybody has one favourite, and while often that boils down to the ""classic"" films like Bambi or Snow White, mine's from a later era: Aristocats, the best of Wolfgang Reitherman's works for Disney in my opinion. He did other enjoyable films like ""Jungle Book"", ""101 Dalmatians"" or ""Robin Hood"", but somehow Aristocats is the most enjoyable, even if it's very simple. It just works: We have cute kittens, we have a love story like in ""Lady and the Tramp"" in Duchesse and Tom O'Malley, we have a Mouse seeking the help of a gang of street-cats, we have two English geese on their Euro-trip, we have a delightfully inapt villain and two ferocious (if old) dogs, and we have a lot of really good songs and music and playful animation. There's simply nothing not to like about this film, and it's as fun to watch as an adult as it was when I was small and saw it on the big screen. And that's the biggest compliment I can make to this masterwork!"
59,The Aristocats,,5 January 2013,Another Disney Classic,"The AristoCats (1970) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Another charming winner from Disney about a mother cat and her three kittens who are kidnapped and placed in the country when the butler realizes that their rich owner has left her fortune the felines and not him. Out in the country the cats come across another one known as O'Malley who plans to help them get back to their owner. THE ARISTOCATS is without question a very fun, action packed and all around good time. This here is certainly the studio at their very best as we get just about everything that one could hope for. I think what makes this film so successful are the characters and their vocal performers. I really thought the O'Malley cat was a terrific character and certainly the most memorable in the picture. I really loved his street toughness and actor Phil Harris did a tremendous job at bringing him to life. The character is just so charming that you can't help but love him. The same is true for the mother Duchess and the vocal work by Eva Gabor. Scatman Crothers is also very memorable in his role as Scat Cat. The songs 'Thomas O'Malley Cat' and ""Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' are both extremely entertaining as well. The animation is wonderful, as you'd expect, and the film has a very fast pace thanks to the wonderful little adventure that the cats are on."
60,The Aristocats,6,4 July 2012,Me-OW!,"It seems like most people on this site really love this film. I really don't want to diss it, but to me there are some really great elements but they are overcome by the film's major flaws.I loved the vocal characterizations. Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, George Lindsey, Pat Buttram, Sterling Holloway, the women who did the geese, all outstanding. The animation is terrific. The journey from the country back to Paris is a series of wonderful scenes. I wish they'd concentrated more on that part.The biggest problem with the film is the villain, Edgar. Yes, he is amusing. But that's not the villain's role. Edgar is clearly playing the usual role of the villain's sidekick or goofy henchman. The villain is supposed to be something of a challenge to defeat and a real threat. Edgar is neither. So Thomas O'Malley is left with little to defeat. A hero can only be as good as the villain is bad and Edgar is too goofy to be a real threat.The Sherman Brothers also let us down. After a promising opening with Maurice Chavalier (did anyone sing this after seeing the movie? Most Sherman Brothers songs audience go home singing) we get nothing memorable. Even the ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"" is sadly, flat. Perhaps if Louis Armstrong had actually done the role of Scat Cat he might have turned it into something but instead Scatman Crothers is given the unenviable task of replacing Satchmo. As anyone, he falls short of the goal.The script also lets the Aristocats down at the oddest times. The scene where Edgar tries to get rid of the cats and faces off with Napoleon and Lafayette plays like a Warner cartoon, not Disney. There is no sense of danger or real threat to the cats. Compare this to the horror of Pinochio finding himself turning into a donkey on Pleasure Island. Then what should be a heartwarming scene where Dutchess and the kittens are reunited with their mistress is skipped entirely. That should have been a great moment in the film, instead its a hole.Again, there's much to like about this film but I think ""The AristoCats"" severely missed Walt who I can't help but think would have demanded more and made changes to bring out more of the heart and the danger that would have made this a real adventure instead of just a animated cat film for kids."
61,The Aristocats,10,23 March 2011,For me the best Disney animation,"I don't think there has been an animated movie I have seen that much as the Aristocats. I have always been a cat loving person so that probably was the reason that I enjoyed it in the first place. But there is so much to like about this gem. The graphics are in no way comparable to today's standards but that doesn't hamper the movie in any way. The story is good, the characters are very entertaining (all of them without any exception) and not to forget there is so much funny scenes in it (the scenes with the dogs and butler Edgar are hilarious!). I really can't think of a single thing that would devalue the movie in any way. For me it is perfect, so I must give it the perfect score."
62,The Aristocats,7,15 April 2008,Hard not to like,"After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak. The animation and backgrounds are a bit scratchy in places, typical of Disney's 70s films, but it does have a rustic, old fashioned charm about it.The Aristocats strongest points are the characters, the music and the humour. The music is very memorable - try getting 'Everybody Wants To Be A Cat' out your head in a hurry! The songs are written by the Sherman Brothers, who also did the music for The Jungle Book. There was one song called 'She Never Felt Alone' that was going to be in the film, but sadly didn't make it into the final feature. It is a shame, because I think it would have fit in very well.The characters are unforgettable. Thomas O'Malley is voiced by Phil Harris, and is basically Baloo in a feline form. Eva Gabor gives Duchess this warm and maternal feel and the kitten's voices actually sound like children, and not an actor imitating the voice of a child. The secondary characters are here by the dozen and yet you still end up understanding their personalities. Edgar, the 'villainous' butler plays a similar role to Cruella De Vil, but he's more comical than scary, often ending up in funny situations. Even though he's the bad guy, he's still lovable all the same.The two British geese - Abigail and Amelia really had me cracking up, along with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like the dogs, who tend to argue over who is 'the leader.' I could go on, but I won't spoil it. But I can tell you, The Aristocats is funny and will entertain everyone without having to resort to rudimentary toilet humour.The bottom line - The Aristocats might not be Disney's crowning achievement, or even their strongest film from the 70s (that award is a tie between The Rescuers and The Many Adventures of Whinnie the Pooh). But it is an enjoyable romp and is sure to entertain. If you are looking for a dazzling work of art, you might be better off watching Bambi. But if you want a fun night in, The Aristocats is the way to go. It is a charming and lovable film and it's impossible to dislike. Enjoy! (And besides, it's good to have a film where cats aren't seen as the villains)."
63,The Aristocats,10,18 April 2005,The Best Traditionally Animated Film Ever!,"This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story. But this is a respectable second, immediately followed by The Lady and the Tramp.Just see it and enjoy what one of the cinema's greatest achievements. And by the by, I'm not a little kid, this is for the older audiences wanting to recapture their childhood. An absolute must!"
64,The Aristocats,10,23 August 2004,I Love Those Cats,"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old.  Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with.  I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano.  In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much.  All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw.  The Ally cat had a great voice!My favorite part of the movie is when the kittens are playing the piano. That part is adorable.  I also enjoy their journey home.  It's incredible. This is one of the best Disney films I ever saw and one of my favorites. Everyone should see it.  I give this film 10/10 stars."
65,The Aristocats,10,18 May 2003,It's a charming animated motion picture especially for cat lovers.,"I really enjoyed this movie and I usually don't like animated pictures. But I thought the cats were appealing and the story line was charming. There is a good song called ""Everybody wants to be a cat,"" that is a lot of fun. It has some comic moments and is an interesting adventure. I think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this film."
66,The Aristocats,,10 February 2003,Pretty Good Background Art,The primary characters and action are often upstaged by the quality of the background art. There is a not-so-subtle ethnic stereotype in the first appearance of Scat Cat's band; watch the drummer.
67,The Aristocats,10,18 June 2001,"This is Disney's best, but most underrated movie.","This is Disney's best movie.  It delivers to all audiences but it especially delivers to its target audience, children.  It has graceful innocence, fantastic voices, great humour, and tremendous music.  It is simple and it is simply wonderful.  Maurice Chevalier and Phil Harris...please, how amazing."
68,The Aristocats,4,9 November 2005,VERY Cute but poor story,"The Aristocats is a cute Disney animation with irresistible cartoon kittens, but this film suffers from a poor storyline. Not even the cute kittens can save this film from the poor storyline. The characters are also not as memorable (and the plot not as satisfying) as other Disney films. Most of my impression of this film is from the eyes of an adult. (I wanted to but never had the opportunity to see this film when I was younger, although I probably *would have* loved it because it featured cats - instead of dogs.) Children may like it, but if you're expecting a very good storyline and terrific film, you will be disappointed. Still...those cartoon kittens *are* cute."
69,The Aristocats,9,31 July 2013,Perhaps the best Disney film from the 1970s,"I saw this film when it was re-released in the cinema when I was a child and I really enjoyed it then. In fact, I still enjoy it as an adult.Like most Disney films from the 1960s to 1980s, the animation style is sketchy and often flickery, in spite of it being smoother when the cat band members walk in silhouette towards the end of 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat' while the backgrounds are beautifully drawn, especially the interior of Madam's mansion, the surroundings of Paris and the countryside, although the backgrounds at night are not quite as colourful as the ones I've already mentioned. The character designs are generally detailed but Roquefort was the most simplistic of them all. As for the music, most of the songs were catchy and memorable, particularly 'The Aristocats (along with the simple opening sequence),' 'Scales and Arpeggios,' 'Thomas O'Malley' and 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat,' while the background music was authentic in some parts and jazzy in others. The storyline is unique to other Disney films since nobody dies and it is not quite as bittersweet as some of Disney's earlier efforts (e.g. 'Dumbo') but it contains humour such as Edgar's use of the phrase, ""straight from the horse's mouth"" much to Frou-Frou's annoyance and the ending between Napoleon and Lafayette and the sentiment of the romance between Duchess and Thomas O'Malley. I also liked the transitions between the scenes where Duchess is concerned about Madam getting worried about her and the kittens and Madam discovering their disappearance in one scene and looking out of the window all forlorn in another. Edgar is a bumbling villain if not as sinister as the likes of Ursula, Jafar and Cruella DeVill, Madam is caring, Duchess is a doting mother, Berlioz and Toulouse are boisterous (I loved Toulouse's commando-type jumping actions) and Marie is adorable. The geese are amusing as well and Thomas is suave. I also liked the voice acting and the play fight scene between the kittens.Overall, this is a rather fun romp from the Disney Classics canon with very catchy music, appealing characters and a witty, sharp and sometimes moving storyline. 9/10."
70,The Aristocats,9,5 October 2012,The Aristocats,"This is what I got to say, this is the most creative movie title I've ever heard of. Instead of aristocrats you get aristocats. +25 for creative movie titleThe characters are well developed and funny. Thomas O'Malley is the tramp and Duchess is the lady. Is it Lady and the Tramp with cats? Most likely no, but I enjoy those star crossed lovers. Edgar is hilarious, not sinister, but not lame at all. The kittens are adorable and a great source for comic relief. The other animals are witty and funny. +20 for characters!The animation style is different from what Disney usually does, but I'll take it. It looks cool and choppy in a neat way! After Walt Disney passed away (I wish he was alive so their could be no Disney channel or those dumb CGI films that are not tangled), you don't expect perfection because he's not on the worker's butts making this movie perfect. Well this movie doesn't need to be perfect unlike Snow White and Cinderella, but it's just the way I like it. +21 for animationThe plot is simple, but excellent. Rich cats learning how to survive in the real world. They should do this to celebrities; that would be genius! The Aristocats has an enjoyable storyline. +23 for the story25+20+21+23=90 right? A 9/10 yes indeed!"
71,The Aristocats,8,21 September 2012,"I'm the reviewer, I say when the film is good ... it's good ...","What was with Walt Disney and cats: they are wicked and vengeful in ""Pluto's Judgment Day"", innocent and playful in ""The Three Orphan Kittens"" and ""Pinocchio"", but then you got Lucifer in ""Cinderella"" and the Siamese Cats in ""Lady and the Tramp"". Maybe it's not surprising coming up from an artist whose most iconic creation is a mouse well, whatever was between Walt Disney and cats, it thankfully ended when he approved the making of ""The AristoCats"" (he unfortunately wouldn't live up to see the film).And that's how the first film made after Walt Disney's death featured an all cats' cast, in an animal-centred world in the same vein than the previous ""Jungle Book"". Yet, despite their lasting popularity, ""The Aristocats"", ""Robin Hood"", ""The Rescuers"" or ""The Fox and the Hound"" were hardly masterpieces. Indeed, there is a reason why people talked of a Disney Renaissance in 1989 when ""The Little Mermaid"" was released. ""The AristoCats"" is entertaining and fun but it was still carrying the mark of the 60's, with that sort of sketchy animation that reminds more of an elaborated story board than a complete cartoon.Is the rough look distracting? Yes, when it does remind that Golden Age is over, that no movie would ever equal in beauty such treasures as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" or ""Pinocchio"" (or even ""Lady and the Tramp"") and maybe no, because on its own, it gives a sort of artistic touch and originality that remain pleasant to the eyes. The fact that the story takes place in Paris, circa 1910, seems to fit the draft look, as Paris must have been the most drawn town in the world. The sketches are amusedly displayed during the opening credits sequence, just like for ""Robin Hood"" three years later. This kind of experiment is risky but works if you have a good story.The story: an old aristocratic woman, Madame de Bonnefamille, decided to leave her fortune to her female cat Duchess and her three kittens Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse, If anything happened to them, Edgar, the butler would inherit the fortune. Hearing the conversation between his mistress and her lawyer, Edgar reveals his true villainous face and decides to get rid of the cats. The film is based on a true story but borrows more plot elements from other Disney classics, a villain motivated by greed although not as wicked and evil as Cruella De Vil, the romance between Duchess and Thomas O'Malley, in fact, the whole picture plays like a feline version of ""Lady and the Tramp"" with the jazzy and swingy mood of ""The Jungle Book"".However, the deja-vu feeling operates more on the technical aspect. Many sequences notably the party with the alley cats is like shot-by-shot retaken from ""The Jungle Book""'s monkey part and the dance in ""Robin Hood"", Lady Cluck and Little John's duo is exactly like King Louie and Baloo, and Marian has the same dance movements than Marie. These lazy bits of drawings stroke me when I was a kid, now, I don't pay much attention to it, probably distracted by the memory of Uma Thurman swaying her hips like Marie during the twist dance contest in ""Pulp Fiction"" (if only for having inspired the iconic scene, ""The AristoCats"" deserved to exist). And while I'm writing, I have the catchy 'Everybody wants to be a cat' sung by Scatman Crothers in mind and the extraordinary piano falling through the building's floors and I feel like I should be more enthusiastic.Like every Disney classic, ""The AristoCats"" has a great deal of music, starting with the opening songs sung by Maurice Chevalier. I'm not familiar with all his work, but I know he's an eternal icon of the famous 'Gay Paris', (in the cheerful meaning) with his boater hat and eternal smile, he embodied this French joie de vivre and it would have been an unforgettable omission not to have him sing for ""The AristoCats"" (he sings in the French version, 'naturellement') . He died in 1972, but I hope his hardcore fans have a soft spot for his last but significant contribution to the film industry. And this is I guess- the secret of ""The Aristocats"", its appeal relies more on the little details than the story itself, without peripheral characters, the film would have probably drown in its own cuteness.And that's why even a cat-themed film needed dogs. It's a masterstroke to have inserted Napoleon and Lafayette, one of the craziest and most endearing pairing from any Disney film. Both would be featured in two extraordinary chase scenes involving poor Edgar. When the first chase next to the old mill starts, it's the first bit of action of the film and a classic slapstick moment (with a clever allusion to ""Mary Poppins""), your trust on the film is reinforced, at the second chase, its comical repetition at best. Such simple things are essential because they establish the difference between a good film and a great film. ""The Fox and the Hound"" had a screwball chase moment too, but it involved serious characters while the goofy ones were stuck in a lousy worm-catching subplot. Comic relieves ask for exuberance, over the top and hilarious moments. Lafayette and Napoleon elevate ""The AristoCats"" into its classic status despite minor flaws.Besides, they contributes to one of the most original and memorable Disney films' endings, when the two dogs starts howling in a sort of discotheque ambiance and realizing it's the end, Napoleon solemnly declares  ""Wait a minute. I'm the leader, I say when it's the end.  (and after it bumps into his head)  it's the end"". If ""The Aristocats"" is a plate with the music as dressing, well, take Napoleon and LaFayette as the salt and pepper that gives the film all its flavor. Having said that, ""Bon Appétit""!"
72,The Aristocats,10,3 September 2009,My favorite of the Disney classics.,"The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too. I'd be devastated of some old bag who I'd been working with for so many years just decides to give her will to the cats. I'd of killed them also. I don't even like cats, so I wouldn't give a damn. I think that The Aristorcats is so funny and cute. There are many characters that are hilarious, like Edgar. The Aristorcats is my favorite of the Disney classics, and that's final. The Cat's out of the bag.The Aristorcats: ****/****"
73,The Aristocats,,14 January 2009,Not Everybody Wants to Be a Cat !,"It's enjoyable for sure, but not that enjoyable though. I think Disney studio lived its most critical moments at the 1970s. Maybe at the 1980s the live movies made some success but the cartoon waited till the start of the 1990s to rise again in a new golden age. So (The AristoCats - 1970) was just the beginning of a decline, or it was what this great studio used to present in that era between 2 great phases.As a cartoon it got few exceptional moments. I loved when the kidnapper's car was escaping through Paris's streets at night; that was the top of this movie's artistic personality. Some (and not all) of the songs were memorable such as ""Everybody Wants to Be a Cat""; at the 2000s Disney included it as one of its best songs at one album had ""When You Wish upon Star"", or ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"". (Phil Harris) owned the vocal performance as (O'Malley) this is the best coarse voice you can ever hear. (Maurice Chevalier) who came from his retirement added a real value to it despite being here just for singing the title song at the opening credits.But on the other hand, it's not that cinematic. It lacked so many thrilling, touching moments, and it's not that engaging as a whole. I believe that comes originally from how the AristoCats was intended as a two-part, live-action installment of the TV series (Disneyland - 1954). Not to mention that the case is similar to ""The Lady and The Tramp"" too, so the TV's feel and the loser comparison in the back of your head make the efficiency weak. Moreover I couldn't understand why it took place in Paris in the first place ? It even not based on some original story to be obligated by its events ?!Overall it didn't perfectly utilize the bunch of nice characters it had, nor bring some good comic situations out of them as guest stars in a road movie. The romantic feel wasn't solid, and the action was poor. The scene in which the evil butler was trying to bring back his things from the 2 sleepy dogs aside from being the most boring moment, it can summarize the routine and the slack personality of this movie. All the time you must have had the feeling that it had been produced by another studio. The certain touch of glamour or proficiency is surely taken. It's an evening for kids, ordinary in a bad sense, and not like what this very studio used to dazzle us decades before. As the last animated feature to be approved by Walt Disney and the studio's first animated feature to be completed after his death ; it's not the end of an era, it's the start of lower one."
74,The Aristocats,7,11 January 2009,Funny if not as preaching entertaining Disney picture,"A group of cats look to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler.The Aristocats is regarded as one of Walt Disney's finest 2D animations with its charming script and cool characters, but it doesn't quite have the magic that created Snow White or the Jungle Book.The slow opening will have younger viewers raising their eyebrows but once the cats become established into the story does the fun and entertainment begin.The young cats create the most enjoyment with a charming young hearted rivalry, the special kind of bonding any brother or sister of any age can associate with.Not the funniest Disney picture out there but there are some great comic moments, especially involving the Cats and the Dogs. The representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing.The story, after the boring beginning, is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family film should be. There are hardly any lapses and no dull moments. The journey to find home is interesting and you get a sense of exploring, not to mention two very strange British swans.With Disney, you always get a strong meaningful message. With the Jungle Book it is where you belong, with Beauty and the Beast you explore the importance of inner beauty. However with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing. The film has the importance and relevance of home but is not cemented enough; it seems very far fetched and irrelevant.My sister and I found it very strange watching this as some of the central characters were voiced by the Jungle Book cast.Despite the bad beginning and the confusion of its preaching message, this is a consistently fun family film with a good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to."
75,The Aristocats,9,21 July 2007,A Super Cute Movie SPOILERS,This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T Dutchess and the kittens love music.They have to practice the piano everyday.But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. Them Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into song. With the song everybody wants to be a cat. Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!
76,The Aristocats,10,22 March 2007,One of Disney's Finest!,"The Aristocats is absolutely a true Disney Classic! Don't let the sweet, playful cats fool you into thinking the movie's for the little ones. Everyone will enjoy it. One of the movie's best qualities is the characters. Their drawn beautifully and have memorable personalities, brilliantly portrayed by their actors. Phil Harris' voice is classic as the smooth-talking, alley-cat Thomas O'Malley. Eva Gabor's sweet, soft-spoken, accented voice is a perfect fit for the refined Dutchess. The kittens, while voiced by less famous people, definitely don't fall short; their voices to enhance their characters, from prissy Marie, too tough-guy Toulose, to musical Berlioz. Napoleon and Laffayette are hysterical.This movie is a musical jam-packed with catchy songs. ""Thomas O'Malley"" and the instant classic "" Everybody Wants to Be a Cat"" are timeless songs with swinging lyrics and rhythm. The animation is remarkable, ranging from beautiful French countryside, to eye-popping , jazzy dance scenes. The script is perfectly executed, balancing Dutchess' sweetness with Thomas' wit.The Aristocats is nothing short of a classic! Ten Stars!"
77,The Aristocats,10,24 December 2006,Charming!,"Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them. When Edgar sees them arriving home, he is furious, and starts to mail them to Timbucktu. But Thomas' friends arrive to help save the day. The wealthy lady decides to leave her home for every alley cat in Paris.This is a charming film. The songs, including ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"", are lively and upbeat. The voice cast is excellent, with Eva Gabor(who would later play Miss Bianca in Disney's THE RESCUERS films) as Duchess, Phil Harris(Baloo in THE JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in ROBIN HOOD) as Thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters. Supposedly Walt Disney, before he died in 1966, gave the go-ahead to this film. Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10."
78,The Aristocats,7,23 September 2006,Everybody Wants To Be A Cat,"Plot in a nutshell - Duchess (voice of Eva Gabor) is the well polished single mother cat of three little kittens. When their owner, the wealthy elderly woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out she decides to write up her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, which will then go to her butler Edgar when the cats pass on. Edgar overhears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything before him, and plots to destroy Duchess and her kittens; he drops sleeping pills in their supper one night and then leaves them stranded in the French countryside. Out of their element, Duchess and her kittens befriend a street smart stray cat known as Thomas O'Malley (voice of Phil Harris who did the voice of the big bear Balloo in the Jungle Book); after making a pass at Duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, O'Malley decides to escort them back home, with Duchess genuinely falling for O'Malley as the usual codependent surrogate family bond develops; chaos and mayhem ensues, culminating in a violent clash between O'Malley, his brother cats from the streets and Edgar. Also features appearances by British geese, American southern hound dogs (what they were doing in France is anyone's guess), a mouse who sounds a lot like the rabbit from ""Alice In Wonderland"" (he was in fact voiced by the same guy who voiced Winnie the Pooh) and a horse. Sometimes slow paced but still enjoyable Disney venture. Features the memorable ""Everybody Wants To Be A Cat"" musical piece sung by the late Scatman Crothers (better known to 1980s fans as the voice of Jazz on Transformers). Of course, if this was being made now, it would probably be a dark social commentary on class division represented by the divide between well bred & well fed Duchess and the street born O'Malley."
79,The Aristocats,10,1 August 2006,"Mee-ouch if a dog person! Just kidding, this is good!!!!!","Disney and Friends continue their hard work in animation with the cat version of ""101 Dalmatians,"" the 1970 classic film ""The Aristocats."" It's a movie about cool cats!!!!! Now, although I am giving this a ten, I am more inclined towards dogs rather than cats, and I like dog movies the most, but this movie's good, too; it's old Disney for everyone!!!!!This played once on the just-destroyed Disney Channel in late 2002. While an old thing was being shown, the damage had been done already (LOL), but I managed to still enjoy the movie anyway. Sure, it was nice, but I wouldn't say that it is the Disney movie on the top of my list. ""The Aristocats"" has big musical numbers; one being ""Everybody!!!!! Everybody!!!!!"" with the cats changing colors!!!!! That'll make you want to get up and dance!!!!!10/10"
80,The Aristocats,10,4 July 2006,Amazing,"Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart. My favorite part is the song and dance number with all of the strays and Thomas O'Malley. The writers/producers/director completely nailed this one.....yeah, nailed it to the wall.xoxo~Wolly~xoxo"
81,The Aristocats,8,13 September 2004,"Not the best, but not the worst...","I have to say, out of Disney's roster, Aristocats is not the best they've ever done. However, it certainly isn't the worst. The story is shallow at best, and only two tiny components stand to redeem the movie.The first is the music. I'd say the musical numbers draw more entertainment than the bulk of the film, as I can still enjoy them, even though I am beyond a juvenile age where anything colorful and loud can occupy me.The second is the pair of farmdogs. Those two are more colorful, more interesting characters than any of the cats in the movie. They give the movie an occasional comedic break it needs from time to time.Overall, I'd recommend this movie if you're trying to keep a six-year-old's attention on one thing for an hour. But as far as quality entertainment, I would recommend an older Disney film like Pinnochio, or Snow White."
82,The Aristocats,,29 February 2004,Best Disney cartoon of the '70s.,"A jazzy, lively Disney offering, The Aristocats is one of the better animated movies from the '70s (a decade during which Disney cartoons as a rule seemed to take a dip in quality). It may have a disappointingly shallow plot, but in other departments this is a delightful movie. The animation is superb, the songs are catchy, and the voice-overs are just right.A wealthy Parisian lady meets her attorney to make her will. She instructs him that she wishes to leave her entire fortune to her beloved pet cats: Duchess, Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse. Unfortunately, the lady's scheming butler Edgar overhears her making the will. He kidnaps the cats and abandons them miles from Paris - hoping that, with them out of the way, he will inherit his ladyship's fortune. The cats are found by charismatic alleycat Thomas O'Malley (voiced by the incomparable Phil Harris), who leads them back to Paris and safety.This is a unique Disney movie, made so by its psychedelic sequences and a villain who is more a bumbling, misguided scoundrel than a traditional, ""boo-hiss"" pantomime-style baddie. The other characters are quite memorable too (besides the cats there's a sleuthing mouse, a bunch of jazz-playing alleycats, two prim and proper English geese, a posh horse, and a jelly-legged 90 year old attorney). All in all, The Aristocats is a splendid way to pass a little time."
83,The Aristocats,10,30 April 1999,The coolest movie ever about cats!,"Although you can see some of the pencil lines in this flick, it is still by far one of my favorite Disney flicks.  I especially like Toulose!!  I love that little guy!  I dig the music!  The love the cats have for Madam is wonderful.  I love the geese sisters!  If you haven't ever watched this...I recommend it!"
84,The Aristocats,7,20 June 2005,The Aristocats,"I remember seeing this Walt Disney Pictures film as a kid, and I was looking forward to seeing it again to see what I'd think, from director Wolfgang Reitherman (One Hundred and One Dalmatians, The Jungle Book). Basically, set in 1910 Paris, pampered house-cat Duchess (The Rescuers' Eva Gabor) and her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin) are loved by their owner Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley). However, when greedy butler Edgar Balthazar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) hears that they will inherit her fortune when she is gone, he kidnaps the cats and leaves them stranded in the countryside. They need to find their way, and they have street-wise, smooth-talking alley cat Thomas O'Malley (The Jungle Book's Phil Harris) to help them. While Thomas, Duchess and the kittens hang out with the likes of Scat Cat (The Shining's Scatman Crothers) and his gang, Edgar is trying to retrace his steps and make sure no-one finds incriminating evidence. When Edgar eventually catches the cats returning home, it is up to Roquefort the mouse (Winnie the Pooh's Sterling Holloway) to get O'Malley and his gang to help. In the end, Egdar gets himself trapped inside a trunk heading to Timbuktu, Africa, and O'Malley gets to stay with Duchess and the kittens. Also starring Monica Evans as Abigail Gabble and Carole Shelley as Amelia Gabble. The animation is reasonable, but it Harris that makes this a real treat, he is just as he was being Baloo, and his co-star Gabor is a good voice too. It also that memorable jazzy song by Harris and Crothers, ""Everybody Wants To Be a Cat"" that makes it worth a viewing, it is a fun cartoon adventure. Very good!"
85,The Aristocats,5,15 August 2006,If you don't love this movie you probably deserve to die.,"I'm joking again. I actually would encourage people to dislike this film. I find it average at best. As a Disney picture, it's a shameless rip-off of ""101 Dalmations"" - only instead of dogs, it's with cats. ""AristoCATS"" -- ha, ha! How clever I wonder how long it took them to come up with that one.Basically the Disney formula is in place - animals on the run from a deranged weirdo who has a strange obsession with animals and wants them dead. In this case it's the butler of a rich woman who has left her estate and belongings to the possession of her cat upon death. The butler decides to get rid of the cat and her new kittens and then have himself be put in the will. It's actually rather dark because he kidnaps the cats and plans for them to die in the wild, but they meet up with a street cat who teaches them the ways of the ""real world."" If you think this plot is incredibly stupid and far-fetched then you are probably right. But as a children's film you can hardly blame it for being utterly nonsensical and not bearing any sense of reality.If you are a Disney enthusiast you will find something to enjoy here. Some of the musical performances are fun. But it's not a remarkable film or one that is particularly memorable from Disney's canon."
86,The Aristocats,10,3 August 2016,"Very good, this movie deserves greater public attention.","When a very rich Parisian lady decides to leave all her assets to her cats, her jealous butler decides to make them disappear so he could have it all. Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, it features a soundtrack composed by George Bruns.We are probably facing one of the most underrated films of Disney Studios. It has a simple script, based on an inheritance dispute between a butler and a family of cats. The voice actors are good and the work of designers is great. The use of softer tones, combined with a firm but discreet pencil, make it very elegant and charming. The film has some important moral messages: the union of the family, as well as help to those in peril, are values ​​visible in the way the cats help each other. On the other hand, the adverse consequences that the butler suffers show the children the punishment for his envy and greed. In the film, the ""dating"" between Duchess and O'Malley recalls the dating scenes made twenty years earlier for ""The Lady and the Tramp"".One of the most appreciated features of this film is the soundtrack, which contains a number of interesting musical moments, from the song of Siamese cats to the song that kittens sing at the piano. But the most striking piece is ""Everybody wants to be a cat."" It comes near the climax and it's a very fun jazz, played by the stray cats."
87,The Aristocats,7,1 May 2016,"Even I, a person who has little experience with cats, want to be a cat","The AristoCats is just another movie that offers a mix of charm, entertainment, and some dull, boring moments. Officially the first film of the Dark Age, there is plenty to go around for music, characters (interesting to see Duchess have a Hungarian accent, courtesy of Eva Gabor), and a workable, understandable amount of intentionally cute scenes. Despite that, there are still plenty of flaws in the story execution, in a way that my interest was swiftly dropping as a casual movie attender (I had to force myself to go through all of it as a critic). I personally found the timing of the re-engagement moments to be quite precise, with the sometimes hilarious antics of Lafayette and Napoleon hitting at the moment that I was about to get up. I might consider it a style, featuring several ups and downs to initially make the audience want to leave, but then transforming into psychological captivation. I was somewhat annoyed by this, though the movie is overall worth a viewing. It might not be suitable for those who despise cats (like Angry Grandpa), so be warned."
88,The Aristocats,9,20 March 2016,Surprisingly enjoyable Disney animated film for kids,"I'm not a Disney movie fan. If I see a Disney cartoon movie on the shelf, I will probably give it a skip and not watch it. So, it was very surprising that I decided to watch it for free on the television on the Disney channel. I'm only 11 turning 12, and I was a bit immature, just like any other person in between 10 and 14, however anyway, my parents wanted to watch it, and I thought, hey, why don't I? So, I watched it with my parents. Not being a fan of cats, I would of expected it to be terrible. But surprisingly, no! I have no idea why I liked it, I just did! It's one of those movies where you can't explain why you like it, but you seem to like it anyway. The movie was just really good! Although I rated it a 9/10, I actually think it should have a 8.1/10. A good classic movie, I guess. Great movie for kids. I'm settling on 8.1/10."
89,The Aristocats,8,14 February 2016,"Disney's ""Cat"" Movie !","First saw the movie in 1972 when it was released in French Canada (the Parisian french version fits very well, with France's voice celebrities Roger Carel and Claude Bertrand among the cast...). I enjoyed it then... and still today enjoyed it so fully...Greedy butler Edgar tries to get rid of her mistress' cats to have their inheritance, however, a clever mouse, two dogs, English Goose sisters, a horse and a charming alley cat with his band of jazz cats save the day for Duchess and her kittens.Great Disney fare for all. And if you love cats, you'll fall in love with Paris and the French countryside settings. And enjoy the gags and the songs...Everybody wants to be a cat here... You'll love it !"
90,The Aristocats,6,25 August 2014,Kids will love it,"Kids will love it, but adults might find it so-so. Not anywhere near as good as Wolfgang Reitherman's previous movie, The Jungle Book. Story is quite basic, even dull at times. Music is okay but not great. Certainly not in The Jungle Book's league.This said, it has many sweet moments. It is shortish - 70 minutes long.Animation is also different to The Jungle Book, though this is not necessarily a bad thing. Here the animations seem more like water colour paintings than cartoons, which gives the movie a more artistic impression. With Paris as the setting, it works well.Voice performances are good, and well-cast. Phil Harris, who played Baloo in The Jungle Book, is back, as O'Malley The Alley Cat, and does a great job."
91,The Aristocats,9,21 January 2012,Possibly one of the best Disney films ever.,"This is a film that is incredibly underrated. At the tender age of two, I went through a fanatical phase of watching The Aristocats again and again, at least twice a day; a craze that still makes sense to me now. This is an incredibly simple storyline that works wonders with both kids and adults, and I was shocked to learn that it was only given 6.9 on this website (IMDB), rated lower than The Fox and the Hound, which is nowhere near as brilliant (despite still being good). Although some of the elements hark back to previous Disney hits, the ideas (for the most part) remain original and very enjoyable. Phil Harris, who also lends his dulcet tones to Little John in Robin Hood, and Baloo the Bear in The Jungle Book, plays the classic low-born hero in this romantic journey of self-discovery and fighting to get back home. It is also very funny, with the three main comedy characters (Napoleon, Lafayette and Roquefort) being excellently distributed throughout the film. In addition to this, the evil character, in this case a resentful butler, is not too scary, and has just the right balance of maliciousness and humour. The addition of swing to the ensemble makes this a film that few can rival. The originality of Cats (universally cute creatures) in Paris (a centre of romance and culture) is unrivalled. 'Everybody wants to be a cat'? After that, I certainly do!"
92,The Aristocats,4,2 July 2010,"Nowhere as good as it may seem,","I thought that The AristoCats was gonna be a good original type of Disney animation,it turned out to be nowhere as good as I thought,it was around 90 minutes long and it feels really short and the storyline doesn't really go anywhere.A wealthy old lady decides to make her death will and leaves her fortune to her beloved cats and in case anything happens to them the fortune will go to her butler,but the butler is furious and decides to get rid of the cats and hides them nowhere close for them to find the mansion,the four cats then meet a stray cat called Tomas O Meilly and he helps them out."
93,The Aristocats,9,20 November 2009,Hugely Underrated,"I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind. The music is superb - my disabled son always insists that I lift him up and dance with him to ""Everybody wants to be Cat"" this says it all. And ""Thomas O'Malley"" is just as enjoyable.I'm not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats! And yes, it does take a few of its cues from ""101 Dalmations"", and maybe ""The Lady and the Tramp"" (It's been a long time since I've seen that, so I'm not going to compare them), and while ""101 Dalmations"" is better in some ways, for me ""The Aristocats"" is far more enjoyable. Isn't that what these films are about? Apart from ""Peter Pan"" (now that is a 10/10 film), this is my favourite Disney film. My 7 year-old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it, so you can't ask much more of a family film.Superb!"
94,The Aristocats,8,18 July 2009,"A fun, cute and entertaining Cat-Classic","""The Aristocats"" is classic Disney at it's best. It's not considered as the ultimate Disney classic along side the more well-known Disney-films, but it's a well-made and fun film that certainly deserves to be a Disney classic. ""Aristocats"" is certainly a sure kids-pleaser, cause it has all the components for a fun kids film. I'll liked it very much as a kid. I'm not sure if this film is a sure pleaser to the adults, who could watch Disney classics for the nostalgia sake, but I still enjoy this film as an young adult.Storywise, ""Aristocats"" may not be so complex or innovative, but it doesn't matter. This film was made on that period where the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and wise versa, which ""Aristocats"" certainly shows. The characters make the film; they're all likable, fun, have great lines and have a great interaction with each other. The voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley and etc). A misconception could have been the dogs Napoleon and Lafayette, since they're showstoppers and haven't so much to do with the actual story, but fortunately they're fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold.""Aristocats"" is both entertaining and cute, but it's also a very funny cartoon. The animation style and look fits perfectly for the film's French surroundings (especially the city of Paris looks greats). The character animation and design is great. And the songs are really catchy too. My favorite is ""Scale and Arpeggios"", but the title song is a cute song, along with ""Thomas O'Malley Cat"" and the memorable show-stopper ""Everybody Want's To Be A Cat"". And the score by George Burns is a perfect fit for the film funny and emotional situations.Overall, ""Aristocats"" is in my opinion the best Disney cartoon from the 70's and it's a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered. So what you're waiting for? Do your self a favor and share this Disney classic with your kids. It deserves to be in their memories."
95,The Aristocats,7,15 January 2009,"THE ARISTOCATS (Wolfgang Reitherman, 1970) ***","Walt Disney's 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself (he died in late 1966) and is not generally considered to be among their very best output. The main problem is that, on the surface, the film seems merely to be the feline version of either LADY AND THE TRAMP (1955) or 101 DALMATIONS (1961) both of which are certainly more beloved by fans Even so, being both an animation and cat lover, I dug this reasonably bouncy concoction in which a pampered female cat (voiced by Eva Gabor) and her three little kittens are thrown out onto the streets of Paris by a wealthy lady (Hermione Baddeley)'s greedy butler. Luckily, they meet a streetwise alley cat (Phil Harris) who guides them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by a feline jazz band (led by Scatman Crothers) and two helpful and amiably dopey dogs; meanwhile at home, Edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow feline pets. Legendary entertainer Maurice Chevalier was whisked back from retirement to sing the title song (which includes a verse in French) and Scatman's band indulge in a breezy number ""Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat""."
96,The Aristocats,9,23 November 2008,"Cats, humor, jazz and a hilarious Villain.","When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings. One of the best scene contains him being chased by the two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon. The score is great and like in ""the Jungle Book"" you have scenes that is almost ""musical"" in the sense that the story doesn't progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves via dance. And of course we like, that the score is quite Jazzy.And of course it's not only me but also my children who love this one.Regards Simon"
97,The Aristocats,7,17 June 2008,Cool animation,"Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse. As always, it's really the voices rather than the animation that are the heart of the Disney magic: Phil Harris is brilliant as O'Malley, Eva Gabor as Duchess is... well... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most memorable turns are by Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who turn the old hounds Napoleon and Lafayette into a couple of bumbling Southern-fried rednecks. Their scenes with Edgar, and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his cool-dude band, are classic. Most striking about seeing The Aristocats now is how deeply Disney's style of animation has changed since this was at the cutting edge in 1970. Perhaps the nostalgic, dated feel are just a result of being plonked down in Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are fussier (a pity) and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than in more recent efforts such as Aladdin."
98,The Aristocats,7,11 January 2008,Everybody wants to be a cat,"Following the release of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),' Walt Disney Productions has continued to produce quality animated feature-length children's film, many of which I still haven't had the pleasure of seeing. 'The AristoCats (1970),' directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, was the twentieth film in Disney's official canon, and is a romantic musical comedy revolving around a family of aristocratic cats living in Paris, France in 1910. In the mansion of the elderly Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (voiced by Hermione Baddeley), her loving feline pets  including Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens  are the most important residents. When the bumbling butler, Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), learns that the cats stand to inherit the old lady's entire fortune, he sets about disposing of the pets, dumping them in the countryside far from the big city. Lost and confused, Duchess and her children strike up an acquaintance with a sweet-talking alley cat, Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who agrees to show them the way home.Animation-wise, 'The AristoCats' isn't anything particularly notable, with much earlier Disney films such as 'Snow White' and 'Fantasia (1940),' demonstrating a similar, or even superior, visual style. However, the story is interesting and exciting  particularly for younger audiences, I'll wager  and the musical numbers {which I wish were more numerous} are terrific. For the sake of trivia, I'll name my two favourite songs as ""Thomas O'Malley Cat"" and ""Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat,"" the latter of which is a psychedelic throwback to the late 60s, with a swinging jazz band and delirious flashing colours, led by a trendy feline called the Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers). The family's journey back to Paris is eventful and adventurous, and we meet such friendly characters as Amelia and Abigail Gabble {two talkative geese}, Uncle Waldo {the pair's drunken relative}, Georges Hautecourt {Madam Bonfamille's ancient but sprightly lawyer} and Napoleon and Lafayette {two dim-witted hound dogs with a hunger for the butler's rump}."
99,The Aristocats,7,24 March 2006,Enjoyable; great voice cast,"I have seen this movie only once, several years ago. But I remember liking it a lot.**Spoilers ahead** An old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats. Her butler hears this and plots to get rid of the cats so he can have the fortune. He puts knockout drops in their milk. When they wake up, they find themselves miles away. They must journey back to their house before it is too late. With the help of an independent-minded tomcat and other animal accomplices, while evading the butler and foiling his plan.Could have been better, but it also could have been a lot worse.My Score: 7/10."
100,The Aristocats,6,19 August 2005,Not entirely worthy of the Disney moniker,"The Aristocats is at once arguably one of the last great Disney animated features. It too can be seen as a harbinger of the likes of Fritz The Cat. However aside from O'Malley's swooning for a hit of that ""sweet stuff,"" and his off screen roll in the hay with Duchess punctuated with ""what a finale!"" this film lags behind its predecessors both narratively and artistically. There is some very nice background art. The animation style is often just above a pencil test and while it aesthetically hearkens to 101 Dalmations, there's no real over-stylized flamboyance or flair that Dalmations toyed with so beautifully. While the two hounds are culturally out of place (hobo southerners in the middle of the French countryside?) they do demonstrate some of the best animation in the film, with nice attention to volumes and follow through of movement. There is otherwise some rather untidy treatment of ink and paint here, and not just that which could be chalked up to a matter of style but rather, well just sloppy. A couple walk cycles have the characters so against-the-animation-rules gliding along, completely ignoring the rhythm of their gate. The musical numbers seem more of an excuse to have fun on screen than serving to carry the narrative along in any meaningful or for that matter, useful way."
101,The Aristocats,9,17 February 2004,Cute & fluffy film.,"Engaging characters, nice animation, dynamite songs...all this and cute kitties, too. There's a lot of excellent humor, but no real menace, so don't worry about your little ones. The two farm dogs steal the show, even though they only appear in two scenes. The artwork has a linear quality that may put off some people, but I find it charming."
102,The Aristocats,,15 January 2003,fun for the whole family,"This is one of the best disney classics around.  I liked it so much I named one of my cats O'Malley!  The music and animation were great.  Also classic disney voices like Phil Harris along with great actors' voices Eva Gabor and Scatman Crothers make it even more enjoyable.  I have read some of the other reviews for this and I just don't get how anyone wouldn't like this.  It turned out some of disney's most well known classic songs (everybody wants to be a cat, the o'malley song) just to name a few.  It is much better than the overblown animation movies today, they actually had people draw the stills, not computer animation.  Again a great Disney CLASSIC!!!!!!!!"
103,The Aristocats,,6 July 2002,Truly Offensive,"This is perhaps Disney's weakest effort. Nothing about this film is spectacular and the animation is the worst I've ever seen. This film was made back in the days when Disney was trying to short cut the animation process. And the result shows - The Aristocats is one of the poorest looking Disney films. The songs are unremarkable and the characters, well, they are cats so how worse can it get? Skip this one, you'll thank me later (I'm still trying to figure out myself what made me buy this film)."
