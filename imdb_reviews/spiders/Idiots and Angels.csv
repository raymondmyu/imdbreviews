0,Idiots and Angels,8,25 June 2008,A serious accomplishment.,"Idiots and Angels is a film by long time animator and Oscar nominee Bill Plympton. The film is completely without dialogue, relying on characters actions and fantasies to tell the story. It opens with our anti-hero 'Angel' waking up, shaving, showering and having his breakfast. He drives through the bustling traffic and blows up a car that takes his parking space, then heads to a seedy bar. The bar is populated by the surly landlord, his beautiful, neglected wife and a rather rotund woman sitting in the corner. Angel orders a drink and puffs away on his cigarettes until a cocoon in his hair suddenly gives birth to a butterfly. In their own way each character expresses how they feel - The landlord wants to capture the butterfly and use it to generate business, the fat lady wants to have the natural beauty of the thing and be worshiped by men, the wife would like to soar above the heavens on it's back. Angel? He wants to smash it. Angel is a bad man and his routine is simple: drink, sell guns and smoke cigarettes.One morning he wakes up to discover two small bones sticking out of his back which he manages to cut off with his razor, but the bones are persistent and have soon grown into fully functioning wings. Visiting a back doctor with ideas of his own and delusions of fame, Angel flees and finds himself literally being forced by the wings to do good and to change his ways. While his 'friends' initially humiliate him for his new abnormality, they soon grow envious and decide they want some for themselves.Idiots and Angels is a beautiful animation with striking imagery and a unique ability to change it's tone and message in a heartbeat. What starts off as a comment on banality turns into a noir-ish thriller then transforms into a morality tale before surging head on into romance. It's also a superhero film. And a comedy. Just as the animation morphs with wildly inventive transitions so does the story and pace. Plymton has an excellent eye for imaginative and outrageous imagery and often one is uncertain if what we are seeing is really happening or just in the characters mind, for instance one scene has Angel riding the landlord's wife around the bar like a horse while Tom Wait's sings in the background. The soundtrack as well as the visuals has a lot to do, essentially making up one half of the experience and it just shines with some great choices of both classical and contemporary pieces.Basically I think everyone should see this film. It's a serious accomplishment and I think that Plympton should win his first long deserved Oscar for it. I first became aware of his work when I tuned into late night television aged fifteen and had my mind blown by 'I Married a Strange Person!', his surreal 1997 feature. With Idiots and Angels he has kept the same humour and outrageousness and built on the style to add a heavy emotional air that made me begin to really care about the characters and their fate."
1,Idiots and Angels,,19 December 2010,Bill Plympton returns to form after 'Hair High',"Bill Plympton is a workhorse. Most of his animations are produced virtually alone... hunched over his drawing board for years at a time. And yet he loves doing it... and that enthusiasm comes across in his work. There's a lot of life to his best animations, which retain the scratchy lines of the coloured pencils he uses to fill them in. Plympton started as a caricaturist and the characters he draws have that exaggerated quality to them. He's also endearingly filthy. There's some very funny cartoons on 'Bill's Dirty Shorts'... one of which is a date told from the inside of a woman's mouth. And, no, it's not a sausage that she's eating at the end of the animation.Plympton's last movie 'Hair High' was very disappointing. It had occasional elements of his sleazy sense of humour (including a chicken with a rampant erection), but focused more on a 50s' love story. Another problem was that the animation was much more cell based. The scratchy pencil lines were largely gone, replaced by flatter paints. This is the problem with so many animations. For all of people's gushing over Pixar's stuff they have - amongst a bunch of problems - very little artistry to the animation. There's something dead about CGI animation. Going back to Tex Avery and Chuck Jones, to Will Eisner and comic books, so much of the power of cartoons is the way they exaggerate reality. The distorted faces, the ""pops"" as characters contort to get the emotion across. It's not that far removed from expressionist art. The image portrays the emotion of the character and the animator. Plympton's pencil style gives his animation a grubby and lively feel, a full representation of what he's into.Thankfully 'Idiots and Angels' returns to the pencil drawn style, and with it comes a lot of energy. There's also moments of his trademark sleaze... from the initial joke about the lead guy having (what we think is) a hard-on. The same guy also has sexual fantasies over the cleaner at his local bar, wrapping his body around her and licking as he goes.But 'Idiots and Angels' is much more of - well - an art movie. 'I Married A Strange Person' is pure filth... and hilarious for it. But 'Idiots and Angels' is a full-blown story. A guy - previously an evil gun-runner and hit-man - grows wings. He tries to tie them down, but they always break free. He tries to saw them off, but they grow back. And as they grow, they start controlling him. Knocking his hand away as he reaches for a tit. Getting him to return money from a robbery. Forcing him to rescue people. Eventually, they help him fall in love with the cleaner. And through all that, there's just enough sleaze and violence to ensure the sappy side of the movie doesn't become cloying.'Idiots and Angels' creeps up on you. I was pretty convinced in the first 20 minutes that it wasn't going to be good. It's initially slow, and there are very few gags to ease the pacing. But, as with all of Plympton's ""real"" work, the beauty of the pictures draws you along and - in this case - results in a fascinating story. No character in the movie talks (aside from the odd incoherent grumble) and 'Idiots and Angels' plays like a clever, silent movie. There's some lovely transitions from image to image using animation. The water from a shower morphs into a running tap then milk pouring... all to quickly get across the idea of the morning routine. There is music - including a couple of great old tracks from Tom Waits - and it all gives the movie a dreamlike feel. And that feel makes complete sense with the way the story progresses.I did prefer 'I Married A Strange Person' because it's immense fun. But, if you're in the right contemplative mood, 'Idiots and Angels' has a hell of a lot going for it. And, of course, it's just nice to see a little art return to animation."
2,Idiots and Angels,10,25 March 2009,Plympton's Best Feature By A Mile,"While I have long enjoyed Bill Plympton's short films, I have been left cold by his features. That is until Idiots and Angels came along.The movie is completely free of dialogue and this combined with Bill Plympton's trademark surreal images gives the movie hypnotic quality. I have to say, after all the fuss that was made about the first 30 minutes of the mediocre Wall-E, you would think an animated movie that is without any dialogue at would be declared the greatest thing since sliced bread by the movie going public. Who knows? That may happen, but I doubt it.I'm pretty sure this movie is only playing festivals right now, but, if you have a chance to check it out I highly recommend that you do so."
3,Idiots and Angels,9,20 January 2012,Pretty good,"I always liked the work of the animator Bill Plympton. His shorts (And his movies as well) are not only funny and imaginative (In a very twisted way) but also beautiful to look at: In all his works, Plympton manages to turn the most ordinary things from life into something unpredictable and fascinating, and ""Idiots and Angels"" isn't the exception.While the premise of this film (A selfish and abusive man who grows a pair of wings that forces him to be nice against his will) seems like some sort of moral fable, it is actually much more than that: As always Bill Plympton avoid any kind of clichés or forced messages, instead of that, he exploits all the strangeness that the plot could have. And that's why the film works so well: It's bizarre, twisted and filled with lots of dark comedyBut it is also immensely enjoyable, being able to exploit all the craziness and impossible situations that only could be done in the animated medium.Even when ""Idiots and Angels"" isn't my favorite film from Bill Plympton, it is still a pretty good film, with great animation and music, interesting characters and many impressive scenes. I highly recommend it, especially to those viewers who like strange and surreal films.9/10"
4,Idiots and Angels,10,11 February 2012,Absolutely stunning,"It's always an amazing and thrilling experience to come across art that hits you with its' depth.I tried to watch the film when I was tired and looking to have something on as I slept, and something wouldn't allow me to. I'm glad I waited until I was awake and alert the next day to see this.I've always believed that great work can't easily fit into a genre, and this is one of them.I highly recommend for those that don't seek explosions and loud noises as entertainment, but something that captures the attention.The story is crazy. So much is being said that it's almost overwhelming.Well done."
5,Idiots and Angels,8,28 February 2009,On the wings of Plympton,"If you're new to Plympton world you may be not at home with the language, but I'm sure you'll fall into it throughout the first 20 minutes or so. The fact is I left the cinema with a lot of words in my mind only to learn soon after that the movie is in fact wordless. It didn't feel like that at all. The images are so expressive that the story is perfectly conveyed by their sharp meaning... Illusory as ever Plympton delves ever more deeper and clearer through the imaginary of the human psyche. This is humanity in a nutshell if you will. Plympton takes its pulse on the world along with some great music that further compliments the drawings' edge... Plympton has matured to become a refined groundbreaking animator that will mark cinematic animation for years to come."
6,Idiots and Angels,,7 October 2010,Brilliant!,"""Bill Plympton amazes and amuses yet again in his latest feature animation. I kept thinking, while watching the movie unfold, that I was seeing things I'd never seen before...a marvelous mixture of black humor, otherworldly wonder, and pathos. On one level it's a nonstop stream of sight gags which are ingenious and hilarious. But much more than that, they build and build to create a river of escalating tension and action that gushes into a sea of astonishment, ending with an interesting twist, setting up new ideas to imagine after the movie ends.Bill Plympton's work is utterly one-of-a-kind, so I would advise anyone who likes exploring strange new worlds to run and see this one."""
7,Idiots and Angels,7,23 November 2009,"Good animation, good story, good storytelling","It's good to see a different animation. It's well produced, with good shots. Although it has no dialogs, you don't miss them: the movie has a quite good soundtrack, added to the sound design, makes up a good substitute for possible character conversations. The colors and drawings match the story pretty well. The story, although nothing outstanding, is original and develops fine. The beginning of the movie is slow, telling the usual day-to-day of the main character. He has a boring life, and he's a mean person. Then his life changes, and the film gets more dynamic, up to a point where you don't see time passing by. As the movie evolves, so does the character. First his life get some action, then his personality moves off the common selfishness, as if his experiences were enriching his soul. The quality of the animation is far from the best I've seen, but its other characteristics definitely outweigh that."
8,Idiots and Angels,6,4 May 2008,A Lot to Look At,"In the unit on Self in the Intro Philosophy course that I teach, we talk about the difficulties of imagining the cognition of lesser species, because all animals besides humans don't think in words. This is loosely analogous to seeing a Bill Plympton film, devoid of dialogue as all his works are. For the first 20 minutes, I am enthralled, but by a half an hour in, the continually morphing figures and the animated viscera blur into a soupy blend it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain focus on. I spend the last half of the film slipping in and out of consciousness, enjoying what I see and not all that fussed about missing out on the continuity, because what there is tying the various scenes together is almost entirely subjective anyway.In a way, Plympton's works are immensely impressive, giving one an effect akin to witnessing a 90-minute Salvador Dali painting continually in flux before your eyes. The man undoubtedly has a fertile imagination. Limiting yourself to images only, how do you even plan out a storyline? Does he write out the stories in words and then draw pictures to match the ideas? Or does he just block them out in image-form only? Does he say to himself: ""Ok, then the guy morphs into an ant and the ant envisions himself dancing with the lady in the bar, and then the bar turns into a skip being tossed about on the ocean, and then we pan back and we see that the ocean is just inside the man's head""? Or does he just draw it without any explanation and see where it takes him? Perhaps, though, to paraphrase Kierkegaard (or was it Dick Van Patten?), ""to define him is to negate him"". Just enjoy the visuals - it's a fun ride."
9,Idiots and Angels,,30 September 2011,"It Was Alright, Boring The Last Half","Thought it would be much better since lots of people say that this is his best film, its not that it was a bad story or anything, its just after seeing his other films I found that this one wasn't as visually impressive or had many memorable scenes in it as his others, I liked the first half better than the last half. I was bored in the last half, perhaps no dialogue helped play in that part don't know I don't know it just felt like the movie could of done more.There are lots of greatly drawn scenes, and I love his art style just like all his other films but in the end this one was more boring than all his films"
