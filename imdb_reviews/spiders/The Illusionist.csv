0,The Illusionist,10,6 February 2011,Animated Simplicity,"Simplicity is a very interesting word that is defined in many ways. ""The Illusionist"" is a film that is synonymous with this word and is a visual representation of the art of simplicity. Nominated for every major best Animated Feature Film award including a 2011 Oscar Nomination birth, ""The Illusionist"" is more than just one of the best-animated films of the year. Will it win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film? Probably not just because ""Toy Story 3"" went on a record breaking spree within the animation genre, however, ""The Illusionist"" is just as good as ""Toy Story 3"" if not a little better. The film is based off of a script written in the late 1950s by a French, mime, actor, and director named Jacques Tati, but was forgotten about until Director Syvain Chomet picked up the script and ran with it producing an 80 minute animated masterpiece. The film follows the travels of a French Illusionist from town to town looking for work while performing his artistic magician craft in small shows. However, his profession is lost within the changing entertainment era causing him to lose hope, until one day while traveling in Scotland he met a young girl named Alice. Alice changes his life with her belief that he is actually a real magician seeing through the illusion of magic and personifying it into being. The Illusionist becomes a father or grandfather figure to her as they grow together down very separate paths.The simplicity of the film goes hand in hand with the authenticity and depth of the very easy to watch story. The animation is 2D brilliance with every image on the screen having deeper meaning of some sort. The film uses its filmatic space avoiding lulls and capturing the viewer's attention with its very short run time. This is achieved by the craft of Director Chomet who has created a picture that is so well done it does not even feel like its animated. This can be attributed to cinematography used with the animation. A camera seems as if it is filming the film almost as an alternative reality in a medium that would not of been as effective if it had not been animated. Authenticity is evident even with the minimal dialogue acting a throwback to a simpler era; silent film. It does not rely on its dialogue at all spreading it few and far between, however, when there is dialogue it is true to the setting and the nature of the film. It is in French and guess what? There aren't any annoying subtitles.For some viewers the fact that the film is in French and that there aren't subtitles (I bet the DVD/Blu-Ray will have the option) it may be very frustrating. Also, this is not necessarily a kids movie. Kids will enjoy the magic behind ""The Illusionist"", but will not appreciate it as much as adults because of the immense amount of symbolism in the film.Contemporary film seems to be all about glamor, special effects, and money leading to the creation of hit or miss films. However, film as an art is much simpler than that, which is a metaphor that resonates within the must see film ""The Illusionist"". Remember simplicity, simplicity, simplicity."
1,The Illusionist,9,6 February 2011,You won't find a 2010 movie more visually beautiful than this one.,"Based on an unpublished script by Jacques Tati, The Illusionist follows a magician named Tatischeff, a man whose art form of illusion is dying. He begins taking any job that comes along his way, and even while in Scotland, is accompanied by a young girl named Alice. Tatischeff and Alice develop a sort of father/daughter bond, and Tatischeff ponders his own life as well.The film is directed by Sylvain Chomet, the man probably best known for his 2003 animated art-house feature The Triplets of Belleville. One thing that I simply adore about The Illusionist is that Chomet follows closely to the phrase ""Actions speak louder than words."" The film's dialogue is minimal, and for it's storytelling relies almost entirely on animation, body language, and a simple, but beautiful musical score written by Chomet himself.This isn't even mentioning the animation style itself. I've seen many 2010 movies, but The Illusionist is easily the most gorgeous. The characters are given fluid and realistic movements, and the ambient surroundings of the city and hillsides are outstanding examples of art-direction. I practically had to suppress the tears (And no, I'm not kidding).You may find a movie you like better than The Illusionist, but frankly, I don't think you'll be able to find a SINGLE. DAMN. MOVIE. more beautiful than this one.I give it ***1/2 out of ****"
2,The Illusionist,,20 February 2010,La magie de Monsieur Tati,"All my scepticism was futile, thank God! This animated charmer really oozes Tati's peculiar brand of character comedy from every single pore.Yes, the story is more sentimental and streamlined than the master's original efforts, but Tati's central issues (such as old-fashioned life-styles and values confronted by modern technology), his eye for detail, his pleasantly reserved humanity and his wonderful sense for comedic timing and subtle gags are all left intact by the careful makers of this gem. And the rendering of the Hulot character with all his distinctive mannerisms is a joy to behold.Plus, it's good to see beautiful hand-drawn animation for a change (with sparse use of CGI techniques.) 8 out of 10 querulous white rabbits"
3,The Illusionist,8,3 September 2010,a different experience,"Sylvain Choment's latest film adapts a script by Jacques Tati. The film's unique style is only being shown in forty cinemas across the UK, its box office status falling behind the animated Pixar hit Toy Story 3.Those who are followers of Tati's work or loved Belleville Rendez-vous will inevitably be drawn to such as personal piece. As will those seeking out a different experience from Disney, Pixar and even Studio Ghibli animation. This film, however, may confuse or bore those who are looking for the usual Hollywood narrative. It is a shame the detail of this touching story will be overlooked by so many. KH"
4,The Illusionist,,24 August 2011,Artistic animation laced with subtle sadness,"This is the great L'illusionniste, not the Neil Burger/Jessica Biel/Ed Norton version. While I thought the ill-timed The Prestige competitor was entertaining, it's not even in the same film-making universe. For those of you who are not familiar with Sylvain Chomet's work with The Triplets of Bellville, he showed his live action skill directing that bizarre segment of Paris Je T'Aime involving mimes and the Eiffel Tower.The story is quite simple: a traveling magician finds himself in Scotland performing in a small town. A girl sees his magic and believes it is real. She follows him to Edinburgh all the while believing that the gifts, money, and food he provides for the both of them are fabricated out of thin air. The original story was written by Jacques Tati, a French mime, director, and actor from the mid 1900s. It is a love letter from him to one of his children, but it is unclear whether the story is written to his first child abandoned in infancy or to his other child with whom he never spent enough time. Either way, there is evident a sense of melancholy and guilt in the magician's care of the girl. He sneaks out to a night job to afford to buy her the coat, dress, and shoes she desires; he always produces her spending money with a magical flourish; and he never tells her to her face that she shouldn't believe everything she sees.On one hand, you want to hate the girl  she latches on to the magician and seems so naive and even greedy at some points. On the other hand, the magician chose to keep up the illusion (ooooooh!) and never exposes her to the harshness of the world. It's not until he believes she has someone to care for her that heSPOILER ALERT HEREdisappears and leaves a note that simply says ""Magicians don't exist.""I first saw this film in January at a fairly crowded art theater. Young, old, artistic, and not were all there. When the film's last scene closed, and the credits began to roll, there wasn't a sound in the theater. Nobody spoke, nobody got up to rush out like they normally do. We all just sat there in silence, unsure of how to feel. I was sad, inspired, resentful, and had a lump in my throat. Few films have that impact on me and fewer make me run out to see the movie again. I think the biggest problem (only in that it leaves you a bit confused emotionally) is a lack of closure. Nothing really changes  we don't get to see how the girl reacts to the truth. The magician moves on with his life and career, seemingly untouched by the brief time with the girl. We want a happy ending, a kiss, a death, anything to leave us without an open end to wonder about on the way home.I have not even begun to talk about the beauty of the film. Character design was excellent, from the Brit-pop band to the angry little bunny that makes me laugh every time. More than ever, it makes me long to visit Scotland, the homeland, so I can see Edinburgh firsthand. The artistry of the film is only outdone by the subtle sadness of the story told without any real dialog.This film is instantly one of my favorites. See it in theaters, see it on DVD. See it."
5,The Illusionist,10,22 May 2011,Masterpiece,"Sylvain Chomet's long-awaited follow-up to The Triplets of Belleville adapts an unfilmed screenplay by French master Jacques Tati. Chomet's film doesn't feel much like a Tati film, though - it's very much a Chomet film. But that's okay. I wouldn't want some poor director to feel he has to ape another filmmaker's style. The Illusionist follows a vaudeville magician, modelled after Tati (and called Tatischeff, which was Tati's real last name). He's old, and his world is starting to fade. He leaves France for an extended tour of Britain. Eventually he finds his way to a remote Scottish island, where he meets up with a young woman, Alice. When Tatischeff leaves the island, the girl coyly follows him, and he pretty much adopts her. The two go to Edinburgh (or a fictionalized, Edinburgh-like city) and Tatischeff gets a regular job at a theater (and another at a gas station, secretly, at night) so he can provide the girl with the beautiful clothes she desires (having existed in squalor on the island, she has never seen dresses as beautiful as she does in the city).The biggest resemblance that it bears to Tati's films, besides the Tati caricature at its center, is the fleeting, impossible romance between the man and the girl. All four of the M. Hulot films contain this element to one degree or another. In The Illusionist, the relationship falls somewhere between the analogous romances in M. Hulot's Holiday and Mon Oncle. In Mon Oncle, there is a teenage girl who has a crush on M. Hulot, but he knows he's far too old for her and treats her in an avuncular fashion. In M. Hulot's Holiday, he is quite a bit older than the blonde, who is frequently bothered by boys her own age, but at least he has a chance. In The Illusionist, Tatischeff is an old man. He does love the girl. He can keep her, but can never have her. She essentially isn't any different than his rabbit - living its life in a cage. When it's free, it's only going to bite his finger when he gets too close.The film does not contain much in the way of the grotesque oddities that fueled The Triplets of Belleville. It is much subtler, gentler, and more beautiful. It has a grace all its own. It can be very funny when it wishes. Chomet has obviously spent years on this film, and it looks spectacular. Even if he had made only The Triplets of Belleville, his reputation amongst cinematic animators would be secure, but The Illusionist puts him very near the top of the list of the greatest who ever lived."
6,The Illusionist,7,18 July 2010,Charm over content.,"It was my great privilege to be invited to the world premiere of Sylvain Chomet's follow up to Belleville Rendez-Vous.Set in Edinburgh and produced by an old pal of mine, Bob Last, I had very high expectations indeed. Not least because it is not every day that one of the world's most beautiful cities (my own) would be caught in artful majesty for years to come. And indeed it was. Edinburgh is a real star of this charming but very slight movie.The city shimmers throughout, but the story sadly does not. It reminded me of a novel by Irish writer, William Trevor, called Felicia's Journey in which a young girl is taken into the trust of an older man. In that book (and subsequent film starring Bob Hoskins) and this, there is a slight air of seediness. (That's maybe going too far in the case of The Illusionist but the comparison was palpable for me.) Why the protection? What are the man's motives? I found it mildly uncomfortable. The fact is, in neither case are the intentions, apparently, anything more than protective; but somehow the feeling persists in both that all may not be as it seems.Belleville Rendez-Vous arrived on the film scene like a bolt from the blue. This, sadly, suffers from that difficult second film syndrome. It oozes class and charm from every pore. It looks sublime. But the story (a Jaques Tati cast off) fails to deliver. It simply does not have the muscle to sustain 90 minutes of screen time.A real shame because it has a great deal of merit.Heart? 8/10.Head? 6/10"
7,The Illusionist,10,21 October 2010,"Delicate but vibrant, hand-carved charmer","The long-awaited follow-up to Belleville Rendez-Vous is out at last, and director Sylvain Chomet must be the number one in a field of one, when it comes to contenders for making a long-lost Jaques Tati script into a feature-length animation.The underlying premise of the story here is the same as in all Tati's films: Old is Good, New is Bad. Variety theatre conjurer Monsieur Taticheff is one of the last of the old troupers as TV and rock 'n' roll kill off music hall in the late 1950s. In search of gigs, he takes his grumpy old rabbit and leaves Paris for London, then heads north to the Scottish isles and finally Edinburgh. Along the way he is joined by bored and lonely little Alice, who believes his tricks are the real thing. He has to take on menial jobs to keep up the illusion of magically producing yet more gifts for her.The Paris, London, countryside and Edinburgh of the Fifties are lovingly recreated in charming detail, always bathed in the warm light of nostalgia, and all people - and even the animals - are extreme caricatures while being totally sympatico. The hand-drawn, hand-carved feel of the whole film is greatly added to by some amazing special effects, and not surprisingly with Chomet, there is some genuine magic tucked in there, too. There's just too much in almost every scene to grasp at one sitting, from the crowded country pub to the busy, aerial views of Edinburgh and, like Belleville, it will bear several return visits. It's a truly fantastic ode to the theatre, pre-motorway Britain, Jaques Tati himself and the bitter-sweet meaning of life."
8,The Illusionist,6,17 June 2010,Visual feast or tourism commercial?,"Silent-ish - albeit with the odd, annoyingly generic multi-lingual aside (think that irritating 'Nichole? Papa? Citroen advert) - animated film about a 1950's magician's voyage from Paris to Edinburgh via the Scottish Islands and Highlands. The struggle to find and retain work in a dying craft is beautifully depicted, especially in the final moving sequences when he leaves his rabbit on Salisbury Crags, and a poignant note for his young hanger-on saying 'there are no magicians'. It looks great - as other reviews have said, a real love-letter to Edinburgh in particular, although it veered into 'tourism TV advert' territory rather too much for my liking. The strength is in the beautifully-nuanced period detail. However, some of the farcical vignettes were clichéd and rather dull, and the lack of dialogue meant that the limited storyline failed to hold my attention at times. But I can see why it was chosen to open EIFF this year, and it's a definite feast for the eyes."
9,The Illusionist,9,15 June 2010,A beautiful film,"This is the opening film at this year's Edinburgh International Film Festival and I was lucky enough to see it today with my delegate pass. It's an animated film by Slyvain Chomet. The film did well at Berlin Film Festival earlier this year and I predict it will do very well at Edinburgh this year as well. Briefly the film is about a French magician struggling with his trade, who meets a young Scottish girl. They travel to Edinburgh together and explore the city. I don't want to say too much more than that for anyone reading who wasn't seen the film. Things I loved about the film were that there was barely any dialogue, most things said were in either french or Gaelic and I understand neither, yet I understood the whole film. This is because visually the story is told through actions not words. It's masterfully told this way and beautifully drawn,The visuals were just stunning. I live in Edinburgh where most of the film is set and it made me want to get out and enjoy the city. The drawings aren't always geographically accurate but this doesn't matter. That doesn't affect the film, I just happened to notice because I live here.I loved the subtle humour in some of the backgrounds. Your eye was skilfully drawn to the right places by use of colour placement. A warm glow behind the main character may link to a flyer stuck to the wall. The main character will then walk to pick up this flyer. This was brilliant.On the downside I thought that towards the end the story began to lag a little, maybe just being a tad too long. Other than this there was little I did not like. The ending though when it came brought me to the verge of tears, it was that beautiful. I urge everyone to go see this film when it comes out, or in EIFF if you can get tickets."
10,The Illusionist,7,16 June 2010,Beautifully made but plot lacking colour.,"When I went to go see this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival there was a big buzz surrounding it. People were enthralled that a movie would focus so much on the city, but did it do Edinburgh justice?A few minutes into the movie Edinburgh comes into picture. Set in the 1950's we see a quiet and very quaint Edinburgh. It features heavily on many of the monuments still present today and I love the way we see the architecture unaffected by modern builds. It made me wish I lived back then. The 3D shot that encapsulates all of Edinburgh in one go, is mind-blowing. However, as much as I loved seeing Edinburgh in the wonderful rich colours of detail, I was disappointed by the rather gloomy feel to the movie. Yes, it has its charming moments, especially with the merry, drunk Scotsman character, but much of the side plots and main plots I feel are a tad melancholy which in turn, sobered my experience of the film. The little dialogue (mainly in French and Gaelic; I don't understand either) is pretty easy to follow, but during the end of the film I was left cold when I misunderstood small phrases. It did frustrate me a little, but it led me to interpret the film differently, giving an ambiguous feel to an overall very charming and impressive piece of animation."
11,The Illusionist,7,2 February 2011,I was expecting more.,"""The Illusionist"" was good, but I don't see what the great reviews were about. (I agree with a previous writer who compared all the glowing reviews to ""The Emperor's New Clothes."") The animation was, indeed, subtle and exquisite, but I couldn't get into the story. Maybe the story itself was too subtle for me. Maybe I expected too much, since I thought ""The Triplets of Belleville"" (same director; hand-drawn animation) was one of the best movies I had ever seen.I felt no connection with either the man or the girl. The other characters popped in and out so quickly that they were almost forgettable. And the ending was unsatisfying.If I had seen this first, it would not have prompted me to see 'The Triplets of Belleville'.NOTE: This is NOT a movie for children."
12,The Illusionist,6,21 June 2010,Broken Enchantments,"Since the post-WWII wave of neo-realism, filmmakers have been exploring the beauty within the recesses of the urban landscape. The Italians had Rome's 'any space whatever'; the French New Wave caressed Paris; Woody penned his love letter to Manhattan, Spike wrote his to Brooklyn; Jean-Pierre did Montmartre; John Hughes did Chicago; and now with 'L'illsionniste' Sylvain Chomet has Edinburgh. The film is, indeed, bestowed with loving detail upon Scotland's capitol. Sadly, the narrative providing the means for discovering the city imparts a final impression of cold disillusionment that starkly contrasts with the city that I've come to know in the last three years.Chomet tells the story of an aging slight-of-hand magician -- a cartoon of an already cartoonish M. Hulot -- who takes his outdated stage act from Paris to Scotland's Hebrides isles. His magic and kindness inspires a naïve young maiden to tag-along with him and the two find themselves in Edinburgh. The remainder of the film is a coming-of-age story for both characters: a slowly paced, melancholy journey of economic hardship and broken enchantments. The city crushes the magic and mystery of life, leaving the viewer with an acute sense of doomed mortality.Of course, glimpses of brilliance can be found. The animation medium befits the Jacques Tati character as well as Edinburgh itself, and Chomet's restrained style teases out the occasional smile from the ordinary moments of life. Unfortunately what is missing is the very thing I love most about the city: its people. Edinburgh is a city of extraordinary people and heritage. It seems then, that though Chomet's heartfelt intention was to show off the city he calls home, he failed to recognise its most remarkable asset. It's the people that give life to Edinburgh and without this city of endless stone does indeed seem cold. Had Chomet focused more on the characters' interactions with the residents as opposed to themselves, I think the film would have better communicated a stirring sense of hope and quiet pride that would have left the viewer with a greater desire for and appreciation of the city of Edinburgh."
13,The Illusionist,10,12 May 2011,Magical and beautiful,"After just having perused some of the most obnoxious and idiotic ""reviews"" for this film, one just has to speak up. Two fools on here actually go so far as to imply the film has overtones that make them uncomfortable, namely an older man and younger woman. This, of course, says more about the ""reviewers"" than anything on view in the film; note to ""reviewers:"" get a life or seek help.Then you have the Tati acolytes who think they know everything and decry the film just because someone else had the temerity to make it. Then you have the just plain ignorant, with several people talking about how long the ninety minute film is. Note to ignorant: Sans credits, the film runs seventy-two minutes. The most horrible films have drooling, rabid ""reviewers"" crying ""A neglected gem!"" about films that should be deposited in a trash can. But for this? This they decry. Unbelievable. I'm not going to say much about the film because it should be discovered. It is a film of magic, it is a film of beauty, it is a film of small moments, it is a film that will ultimately be considered a masterpiece and these selfsame anonymous ""reviewers"" will jump on the bandwagon and blithely forget what they originally said. See it. Sylvain Chomet is the real deal."
14,The Illusionist,8,26 May 2011,Agree With Most Of The People Here,"I pretty much had the same opinion of this film as most of the reviewers here on IMDb. I loved the incredible, stunning visuals but thought the story was so-so.You'd be hard-pressed to find a prettier animated film, especially when viewed on Blu-Ray. The artwork in here is simply jaw-dropping, scene after scene. I just wish the story had been as much fun as Sylvan Chomet's previous effort, ""The Triplets Of Belleville."" This story is kind of drab - the opposite of the beautiful drawings, under the art direction of Bjame Hansen.For you adults that would like a serious, almost melodramatic story in a different genre (animation), this film should be extremely appealing.For the artwork alone, I found it worthwhile watching."
15,The Illusionist,10,11 April 2011,Beautiful film,"The semantics of the titular character's table-side note can be disseminated and reassembled however the viewer chooses, but The Illusionist a dedication to the idea that ""magic""...""illusions"" are inescapable. Subsequently the people who perform them do exist.At various points illusions are shown which are neither controlled or ""performed"" as such. The Illusionist's rabbit ""disappearing"" into the soup is a good example of this; another: the Illusionist pretends, or is misunderstood as an auto-mechanic, but none-the-less performs his assigned task; another: Alice gradually dressing-up and impressing a past analogue of herself; another: the subversion of the scream-inducing alpha-male rock band into effeminate go-go dancers. If we're to carry this notion further into film clearly this ""note"" (and if you want, the entire father-daughter relationship) is simply another ruse...an unintentional machination devised for her to be happy. His eventual collapse into a ""magical decline"" (due to his dying art-form and the dilution of its grandeur) and his final denial as a magician all culminates in her happiness. It is an exact analogue to the Illusionist's having removed Alice's stale red jacket to reveal a prettier white one.Not only this but as we leave the apartment the window blows open and creates a fluttering mass of shadowy uncertainty on the wall; Alice and her boyfriend are purposefully depicted in bright colors against a sea of umbrellas; the lights dim, but do not ""blacken"", the ventriloquist's puppet in the shop window; and most importantly, the TVs still shine light in the closed down shop.Finally then, The Illusionist and Chomet (as magic and magician) perform their final trick on us: a child loses their small pencil in the train car, and as the Illusionist picks it up he pairs it with his own longer pencil and makes them disappear into his sleeve. Here he has a choice to make the child's pencil magically lengthen...but instead returns the very same smaller one. The same prop is replaced, through illusion, with the same prop. Likewise, the relationship of a father with his daughter is gradually replaced with a stronger, mutual one (compare the voyeuristic peering of the Illusionist as he comes home drunk with Alice's first kiss in the rain). The ""same"" is disappeared by ""different"" and returned as the ""same"", magic replaced by stronger magic. Or if you prefer...reality itself."
16,The Illusionist,6,21 August 2010,Magic Moments,"Perhaps I should begin by stating that I have not seen Belleville Rendez-vous, have never had any real desire to do so and whilst I have seen a couple of Jacques Tati films he is someone I can take or leave. I checked out The Illusionist on the basis of what amounted to several Rave reviews plus, many of which made a point of mentioning the hand-drawn animation rather than cgi, plus the knowledge that the film touched on vaudeville in Paris in the 1950s. I didn't expect it to eclipse Clouzot's Quai des Orfevres which dealt with French Music Hall in the 1940s or Paris,'36, which did the same for the 1930s and the Popular Front but it is a subject in which I am interested so I checked it out. Whilst I am not prepared to endorse the 'rave' reviews in the National Press I did find it well made and moving with an incredible attention to detail."
17,The Illusionist,1,3 August 2010,Failing to walk in the footsteps of a genius.,"Despite its good intentions, with its original touching story adapted from the influential comic master Jacques Tati, this animated film may well alienate much of its audience with its melancholy slow pace. With the changing of time the once famous illusionist who is the hero of the movie is forced, in the late 1950's, to leave the theatres of Paris to find new opportunities elsewhere as one generation is gradually replaced by more modern, fresher emerging artists. Thus the once famous out of luck magician, who is no longer young or in fashion is found, after an unsuccessful stint in London, settling in a small Scottish village ... There, he meets Alice, a young woman who will change his life by breaking his solitude when a surrogate father daughter relationship (although at times it could be anything) evolves between the two strangers.From a hopeful opening the movie thereafter is guilty of plunging the viewer into deep lethargy, which ultimately turns into an indifference towards ether of two the main protagonists. What develops for much of the remainder of the movie is a near silent drawn out trudge punctuated by the most ridiculous take on Gaelic whose sole achievement is to accentuate its own irritation to the audience. Unfortunately after an hour the craftsmanship of The Illusionists visuals are not enough to draw a meaningful response to its intended sad conclusion other than being grateful that your own suffering has thankfully ended.In conclusion The Illusionist falls far short of the promised masterpiece that was expected from almost a decade in production and illustrates the limitations of Sylvan Chomet as a noteworthy features Director."
18,The Illusionist,3,29 August 2010,"Beautifully drawn but sentimental, ponderous and pointless","I was looking forward to this film, but was sadly disappointed. In common with Chaplain and many others, Tati fell into the pathos trap later in his career. Long drawn out, deeply unfunny routines, holding up what is essentially a non-story, do not a movie make. The only reason for the three stars is that the animation itself is undeniably wonderful. But as with 3-D and Dolby surround, it's only there to serve the story, which frankly bored me to death. A middle aged failure bewildered by modernity is a frequent theme of comedy performers, and they nearly all make you want to hit them over the head and plead with them to stop asking for our pity. This film was an exercise in animation, nothing more. The cloying, unending melancholy has nothing to brighten it or change direction. In essence, nothing happens. My companion liked it, saying it was a slice of real life, but I would argue that animation isn't about real life, and it certainly isn't enough to justify the money spent on it. If you want to see a great animated film, watch Toy Story 3. This is like a painting, a lovely adornment, but don't expect to laugh, cry or be moved, it's too predictable and empty. Sorry Jacques, sorry everyone, this one missed by a mile."
19,The Illusionist,6,17 June 2011,"A melancholy, visually interesting and bitter-sweet film.","A film by French film maker Sylvain Chomet, who also directed The Triplets of Bellville. It is a wonderfully delicate film, visually it provides a lot of interest and is particularly relevant to those who know the city of Edinburgh in which a large portion of the film is set.As an animated film, The Illusionist has the feeling of being children's film, however the film has an extreme dearth of dialogue, with only a few spoken lines, which are not all in English. Nor is the film action packed or concerning a character to whom children will readily relate. Like the opening scene of ""Up"" The Illusionist conveys the arc of life and the melancholy of old age, an issue most children will find it hard to understand. From an adult point of view this is a bitter-sweet, beautiful film.In 1950s France, magician Tatischeff is finding it increasingly difficult to make a living as his style of entertainment goes out of fashion. Tatischeff travels across Europe looking for a home for his act, and picks up orphan Alice along the way, finally settling in Edinburgh.The film has some comic moments, Tatischeff's uncooperative rabbit who resents being pulled out of a hat, provides one such moment, although these are tinged with the melancholy which runs throughout the film.The film's story is linked with the life and work of Jacques Tati, though how closely is widely debated. The debate and the elements of Tati's life which are said to inspire the story adds an extra level of depth and interest to the film.The calm and serene beauty of the film, with little action, virtually no dialogue and a soundtrack which lulls you into a dreamlike state the film verges on dull and soporific. While the overwhelming sadness which runs throughout the film causes a sense of woe, leaving you contemplating the message of the film."
20,The Illusionist,3,20 August 2010,Lacking magic,"Having seen it tonight I was left disappointed and I can't understand the acclaim this movie has been getting from the press for what is a very dull movie that fails to make an emotional connection. Although trying to visually mimic 1960's Disney, The Illusionist falls dramatically short once the spell of the odd animation gem is no longer suffice to save the tediously told story. Something more appropriate to watch in the background at home on Boxing Day whilst you read a book occasionally raising your head for the few visual highlights. Not a classic and not the best animated movie of the year which so far has to be How to Train your Dragon or Toy Story 3 with the later superbly depicting the emotions of coming of age and the passing of time that The Illusionist fails to deliver."
21,The Illusionist,,20 August 2010,Realism within a magical animation of exceptional beauty,"Life is hard and sometimes beautiful - this fact is a theme that runs through the beautiful animation called The Illusionist. Let's get the following fact straight; the animation is so beautiful it leaves one in awe. In an age of computer Pixar type stories that drown one's senses in garish images and voiceovers from Hollywood celebrities - The Illusionist is pure and and unadulterated. Enough has been said about the story on this site and the story is poignant and deeply felt by the director and aptly conveyed to the audience. It is not boring at all - but it takes its time to show you the pain of life and the beauty of kindness and continuing hope through the gesture of love and sharing. Remember all you cynics who judge the actions of the old man - it was the young girl who pursued HIM. Why? Because she saw his love and she saw it as a way to escape her misery and drudgery. There was nothing seedy in their connection at all. The backdrop of Scotland and Edinburgh was magical and true. Edinburgh is a magnificent dark old city where is rains MOST of the time. The black rock and imposing buildings were marvellously drawn and gave an immense depth to the story. What a fantastic place to set this story of pain and joy, reward and loss....the idea that Edinburgh was in any way insulted by this story is ludicrous. It was a celebration of Edinburgh's contrasts and the light of the city in rain or sun, night or day. It was a direct message to the range of human emotions that humans feel day by day. The magician had suffered great loss in his life, but it did not make him bitter or cruel; it made him kind and giving and even when he had invested so much love in the girl for no motive other than to GIVE; he was ready to give her the moment to pursue her youthful dreams of young love. As in all experiences of life - love and relationships are transient and the Illusionist shows this very well. The final scenes are sad because they deal with the fact that in life we cannot always have what we want or need. The Illusionist departs and the young couple are left walking along a rainy street in Edinburgh - the nature of young love is to see hope and light in everything; for those times of new love it is hard to see that life teaches one hard lessons. The road is long and can be at times beautiful and many times not. The Illusionist is one of the most beautiful stories to emerge in modern animation for a very long time."
22,The Illusionist,3,13 September 2010,Comic moments squandered,"I was intrigued by the idea of this film - an animated adaptation of a script written in 1956 by French physical comedian and director Jacques Tati.Jacques Tati knew how to mix the sentimental with the comic. He had a wonderful sense of physical comedy, based on the close observation of human behaviour, and subtle, beautifully timed physical reactions. His on screen character was awkward but likable, often intensely interested in the people around him, but usually missing the point.This kind of comedy is a difficult thing to pull of in an animated film, and, unfortunately, The Illusionist generally fails to deliver on the laughs that appeared to have been written into the script.I think the central problem is the medium. Despite the painstaking realism and beauty of the backgrounds, the characters who perform comic actions are look and move like traditional ""funny"" characters. It's an easy trap to fall into, but it ruins the comedy. The comic vignettes in Tati's films usually involve characters who take themselves seriously but are funny to others. In the Illusionist, they are presented as ""wacky"" characters with exaggerated features and movements. Instead of being an absurd version of everyday behaviour, the comedy is reduced to a very tame version of cartoon slapstick.The Illusionist, the ""Tati"" character, watches the antics around him with a kind of dumbfounded depression, very different from the lively, affable character we're used to in the Tati films - although I couldn't help thinking that this might be how Tati himself might look if he were watching this adaptation of his script. Instead of being inquisitive, and involved in the action, he seems to stand around blandly watching the hilarity of others. There are one or two exceptions. A scene where the main character gets a part-time job in a garage came close, and there's a perfect Tati moment later in the film where the character tries to ascend a staircase without stepping on the cleaner who is scrubbing the steps. But these moments were rare. Time and again, scenes that might have been hilarious are trampled over, and turned into Saturday morning slapstick or ironic pathos. The comedy is squandered.It might be argued that this is more a tragedy than a comedy. But even here the emotional coldness of the main character makes him hard to relate to. He seems to have few passions or goals, beyond earning enough money to feed himself. There is a relationship between him and his female companion, but again the emotions run cool, and it is not clear why we should care about it. It becomes a tiring film about a tired man.This film is about looks. It is not a film that seems to like people or derive any pleasure from watching them. The heavy use of wide angles give a cool, analytical feel, very different from the warm humanity of Tati films. The stars of this film are the city of Edinburgh, the sky, the sea, and the weather."
23,The Illusionist,1,19 August 2010,A subterfuge of lies surround this film...,"The precise reason Chomet has wilfully chosen to misinterpret and pervert the true nature of Tati's original script, thus diluting and undermining its validity, is unclear. But in so doing, preposterously in this observers opinion, by attempting to re-write the personal details of a private life, weaving in similes that flimsily echo the personal journey that he (Chomet) has shared with his own daughter throughout the creative process merely serves to provide a smokescreen, a cheap conjurer's trick, neatly drawing attention away from what lies at the central core of the l'Illusionniste; a far deeper, intrinsically more compelling story that Chomet has stubbornly, and for whatever reason, completely failed to grasp. And now, all these years on, it seems somehow perverse and downright degrading that a young woman, abandoned in youth, is now once again in her dotage, but not just by her father (as if this is not bad enough), but by the slanted agenda's of individuals and estates who seek to embroider the separate strands of their own lives into the Jaques Tati myth at the expense of those biologically tied.http:// www.guardian.co.uk/ world/2010/ jan/31/ jacques-tati-lost-film-family-illusionnisteRemove spaces in link to work."
24,The Illusionist,5,16 June 2010,Nice and sad and almost boring all along,"It took 7 years for Sylvain Chomet to come up with a new animation feature. This already is something that builds up expectations very high. And for all the beautiful animation skills on display, Les Triplettes de Belleville was, above all, an heavily dark story with only light touches that served merely as stinging irony.So what was I expecting in the Illusionnist? Not much. The visual/technical brilliance is here, the images are beautiful. That's all I was sure to get. Unfortunately the gloomy atmosphere is still dominating yet it's more melancholy than dehumanization.THAT WHICH WE NAME STYLE I really think Sylvain Chomet, for all his technical talent, is over-rated. European critics are too pleased with gloomy stories and clean-cut and raw style: that's enough for them to praise an auteur. Although it's great to market a picture where there is no dialogue, Chomet is not Chaplin, and not even Tati. And Tati struggled to stay creative, half of his films are boring while the other half are masterpieces. Whith Chomet half of his movies are beautiful (the visual part) and the other half is dead-boring (the story, the characters).So Chomet is only technically good and the critics have inflated his visual pessimism into Great Art. The worst in it is that he had 7 years to think he was really good and now I don't see how 2010 audiences will be cooed into admiring a flat backward-looking movie.PS the 3D aerial Edinburgh shot is totally out of place and a lame waste of money"
25,The Illusionist,4,21 February 2011,Very Slow and Ultimately Unsatisfying,"I would not have heard about this film if it did not earn one of only three slots in the race for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. Previously, Oscar favorably introduced me to the fantastic ""The Secret of Kells"" via a surprise nomination last year. So I felt sure I also wanted to watch this film as well.First comment would definitely be the look. The artwork had a very old and even faded feel to them. The characters themselves were not drawn in an attractive or memorable way. Second, the dialog, if you can call it that, was nothing more than indistinct mumbling in a foreign language with no subtitles. This was basically a silent film, as the story was told more by actions and not words. With these two characteristics alone, you know that this film would not really appeal to younger viewers who have grown up only knowing about the bright colors, cute characters and sassy dialogs of Disney and Pixar. Which brings us to the story. The titular ""Illusionist"" is a lonely old vaudeville-style magician who travels around getting whatever gig he can get, from dingy theaters to house parties just to earn his living. Once in a remote Scottish village, he he impresses a young servant girl by ""magically"" giving her a pair of red shoes. Fascinated, the girl packs up and follows him, joining him to his next gig in the city. She would wish for something (like a stylish coat or stiletto shoes she sees in store windows) and he would try to preserve the illusion of magic by ""conjuring"" it up (even if it means taking up odd jobs on the side). Of course, you simply know he can't keep up this arrangement for very long.The whole movie is about an hour and 15 minutes long, but I think it would have worked better as a short film. The feeling of loneliness and melancholy pervades the whole film from beginning to end. The humorous bits are very few and far between, and sometimes too black for comfort. Ultimately, the very slow pace, turgid storytelling, lame comedy and lackluster presentation makes this ultimately unsatisfying. I felt it did not do anything new or exciting to the field of film animation that would make it deserving of that coveted 3rd slot in the Oscar shortlist."
26,The Illusionist,8,9 February 2011,The Power of Images Over Words,"With The Illusionist on the Oscar race, perhaps it's a good time to finally review it. I've never seen a movie by Jacques Tati and I wonder how much that has affected my complete enjoyment of this movie, which is based on an original screenplay by him and whose protagonist, the magician Tatischeff, is patterned after his mannerisms and physical appearance. Although this dimension of the movie will elude me until I discover the Tati's work, I can still say that Sylvain Chomet's The Illusionist is one of the best movies of 2010.I've been thinking about it since I saw it, in the last days of December, trying to understand what makes it so incredible; the movie took me for a roller-coaster of emotions and the finale broke my heart. And it did it with economy and subtlety. Perhaps the greatest trick this movie plays is being so simple. It has no dialogue, no famous actors loaning their voices to the characters. Its quality is intangible, impossible to pinpoint.Tatischeff, a travelling French illusionist in the '50s, plies his trade all over Europe, going, always with his irascible rabbit, wherever people will hire him to perform his magic tricks. Business isn't doing very well, though, because of new competing forms of entertainment  in one hilarious sequence Chomet shows the illusionist having to wait on the backstage for a Beatles-inspired rock band to finish their act before he can get on stage. There's a feeling of an era fading away in this movie; a running theme is the demise of the old vaudeville performers: magicians, clowns, puppeteers, acrobats, etc., living in cheap hotels, unemployed, prone to suicide and alcoholism. Tatischeff belongs to a breed that wanes mentally and emotionally before dying physically.Finding it harder and harder to go, he finds a new reason to live when he meets Alice, a maid working at a Scottish hotel. He takes her under her wing and takes her with her in his travels. Chomet makes it pretty clear that nothing sexual goes on between the two. Their relationship is of a father taking care of a daughter. For her he sacrifices everything he has to make her happy. In the end he even sacrifices his magic tricks and sense of wonder. He gets jobs to support her but his ineptitude for anything practical becomes apparent in many humorous gags. He tries to combine magic with advertising only for his love for magic to wither. As he becomes disillusioned, Alice grows into an independent woman who finds happiness without him. She seems to get more out of him that he out of her. He doesn't judge or blame her. His sacrifices, which can't be explained with mere altruism, finally make sense in the end.Chomet's animated movie creates and develops in 80 minutes and without words two unique personalities that we grow attached to immediately. There's something wrong when an emotionless, exposition-heavy movie like Inception gets nominated for Best Original Screenplay and this movie, told only with the strength of images, doesn't. It was David Mamet who said that ""a good film script should be able to do completely without dialogue."" The Illusionist does just that and creates two characters I considered more real and cared more for than a few flesh and blood characters from Christopher Nolan's 148-minute-long movie.However has watched Chomet's The Triplets of Belleville knows that this French animator continues to work with old-fashioned hand-drawn animation and that he mixes it with a personal style that oscillates between the poetic and the bizarre. Chomet is not a slave to realism but nevertheless his incursions into the nostalgic and the melancholy reveal fascinating nuances about the human condition, touching upon guilt, self-punishment and the need for redemption.There's little more to say except that, Biutiful and Shutter Island notwithstanding, The Illusionist has the year's most heartbreaking ending. The ending, after an hour of humour and human sentiments, is a punch in the gut, a relentless attack on the wonder and imagination that make our lives more bearable. I withstood the hopeless bleakness of Biutiful, I sympathised with DiCaprio's need to punish himself in Shutter Island. But how can one cope with a movie that, hiding behind an innocent old-fashioned animation style, contains this horrifying conclusion: 'Magicians don't exist.' This is a card Tatischeff writes for Alice in the movie's final moments. A movie  of all things a movie, and animated to boot  saying this is like a cruel joke of vicious cynicism.We all go through life suspecting this may be true, pushing it back into the recesses of our mind like thoughts about death, but when we speak it out loud the world suddenly becomes a dreary and colourless and unbearable place. Who would want to live in a world without magicians? Why live at all? If they don't exist, and I don't mean just magicians in the restricted sense, but all those magicians who invent stories, write books, make movies, all those wonderful entertainers who, in their own way, have something of the old vaudeville and traditional forms of entertainment; if they don't exist, I repeat, if there's no one to make our lives more special and bearable through tricks and illusions then what is life? And what's it good for? Is it just pain and misery, like Biutiful wants us to believe? Although heartbroken Tatischeff may believe that, Sylvain Chomet, a great magician in his own right, proves, with this movie, the opposite. Magicians exist and The Illusionist is one of the most beautiful and elegant magic tricks played on audiences in a long time."
27,The Illusionist,9,28 June 2010,Sylvain Chomet's love letter to Edinburgh,"Sylvain Chomet's feature The Illusionist is another strikingly beautiful animated work. Like Belleville Rendezvous before it, this film features a slightly downbeat but amusing narrative and likable characters. The world they live in is by turns grotesque and beautiful. Like the earlier film, there is virtually no dialogue either, usually just half-heard snapshots of words. The story instead is told via the actions of the characters. Perhaps unsurprisingly the narrative is very simple. But the beauty of this film is not in the storyline but in the details. It's in the gorgeously atmospheric settings, the melancholic characters and the frequent moments of quirky humour. The Illusionist is another triumph for this wonderful French animator.The film is set for the most part in Scotland. And the mysterious misty Highland scenery coupled with the medieval and Georgian beauty of Edinburgh are perfect subject matter for Chomet's style of art. There has always been an enigmatic element of the sublime to this artists work, and the Scottish setting fits him like a glove. It's truly a love letter  especially  to the grand old town of Edinburgh. But the film is more than an aesthetically beautiful exercise, as there are a number of memorable characters and a definite emotional core. This viewer had a lump in his throat at the end, although admittedly the story pleasing does finish on a happy and hopeful note.In summary, The Illusionist is a beautiful and melancholic film about the coming-of-age of a young girl and the end-of-an-era for a type of entertainer. Fabulous stuff."
28,The Illusionist,7,29 March 2011,Delightful yet slightly depressing,"The Illusionist is a strangle little animated feature from France that is quite different from anything i have seen for a long time. Beautifully animated with some delightful sound affects to back it up . This the story of an Illusionist and his friendship with a young girl. This is not a children's film yet there is nothing in it to stop children watching it , i just think it's too dark for kids to enjoy. There is very little dialogue in this film because it relies totally on the brilliant animation. Movement are over exaggerated and the characters are of all shapes and sizes. It reminded me a little of some of the animation i saw on TV in the 70's and A Christmas Carol is one of those cartoons that spring to mind. I really like the first 45 minutes of this but i have to admit the final half left me a little cold. Once the novelty of the movie died off the story took over and the end was slightly depressing and a bit of a damp squib but I'm sure a lot of people will love this simply because it's so different."
29,The Illusionist,10,22 March 2011,The Best Motion Picture of 2010,"I've never been to Scotland, but I will be there, thanks to this film. This is what Cinema should be like, no dialogue, no storytelling, no plot, but the flow of intra-atomic magic. Yes, magicians do exist, and Sylvian Chomet is one of them. No illusion here, only the pure magic. It is not simply about the rural and urban sets, but how Chomet makes us move around them. The backgrounds are rarely static, we have characters moving around the city and then we simply leave the characters on the street and continue our journey through the city ourselves, the background becomes the foreground, the city becomes the character. Simply outstanding animation, brilliant and beautiful. Chomet designs most of his characters himself, and boy, are we in luck. This is when he gets a real cartoonist, every single character including the 'extra's has a soul behind their fantastical features, every single one of them looks like Chomet has put his horcruxes into them. They simply awaken the desire in me to collect them, like Pokemon creatures. And just when you think this is about the mesmerizing visual experience, you realize that the film is already inside you, you never noticed it entering, but it is there, filling you with the sensation only exclusively moving pictures can produce.Chomet is the Exupery of Animation and I am off to the streets now."
30,The Illusionist,1,10 February 2011,This is the only film I can recall that I wish didn't exist.,"At least in terms of the cinema, a screening of Jacques Tati's ""Playtime"" at Chicago's Siskel Film Center in 2008 stands as one of the highs of my life. It wasn't the first time I'd watched it, but as they, it was the first time I really saw it. As an added bonus, Jonathan Rosenbaum led a discussion following the feature. Having read Criterion's DVD's liner notes, I was well aware of the film's financial difficulties as well as Tati's increasing frustration with Monsieur Hulot, his alter ego and most widely recognized character. His masterpiece is populated with fake-Hulots that toy with the audience, but that is only the tip of the iceberg. Rosenbaum explained that while working with Tati, the director shared a draft screenplay where Hulot was killed off in the opening moments. Hulot was the past and he was a forward thinker. Though the character returned in ""Trafic"", it was primarily a means to acquire financing.So how is it that nearly thirty years after the man's death, audiences worldwide are applauding Sylvain Chomet's animated Hulot dead ringer? Since viewing the film last night I've thought of little else. Last night I walked into a small, crowded theater with a fond remembrance for Chomet's ""Triplets of Belleville"". I remembered that ""Triplets"" drew liberally from Tati's sense of humor, but was very much a standalone piece. I had not read a single review, but I knew the film was based on one of Tati's un-produced screenplays. Though primarily set in the UK, the film's locations are similar to those of Tati's first three films (""Mon Oncle's"" modernist home excluded). Those films remain popular favorites on account of their gentle humor and the way they permit audiences to quiver with nostalgia for that storybook, whitewashed Europe that has never been glimpsed with open eyes. Please note, I do not believe Tati intended them to serve as simple nostalgia trips. His gaze is far more detached and observational. Why else would he opt to fore go anything but long shots? He never intended to force any specific interpretation of his films. He presents (an admittedly meticulously constructed) life as he saw it. The audience can draw their own conclusions.It is also crucial to recall that though he plays him on screen, Hulot is not Tati. A descendant of Russian nobility, the director was not an anachronistic airhead, but a serious artist who was both intrigued and concerned by the pace and pressures of modernity. As indicated above, the director grew increasingly frustrated by the public's fancy for Hulot. Though the character frequently does all he can to cling to old ways, his role, like his world, diminished as Tati's films grew increasingly experimental. ""Confusion"", his final screenplay (the one Mr. Rosenbaum referred to), was an examination of a futuristic city where every waking moment was devoted to communication, advertisement, and alienating technology. This was a man with his eyes on 2011, not 1958.It is painfully obvious that were he alive today, Tati would not be interested in producing ""The Illusionist"". As I will reveal below, he had personal reason for writing the script, but as presented by Chomet the film stands as a calculated attempt to lure the sorts of people who came to Tati's work through Mr.Bean or romantic references in films like ""High Fidelity"" and ""Unfaithful"". My gut reaction was confirmed by the smug, attention seeking laughter and wistful sighs during the film's saccharine moments. Tati's mise en scene (and Chomet's approximation of it) is composed so that each viewing is different for each audience member. Even astute viewers are likely to miss details after repeat viewings. In ""Playtime"", you can practically invent your own narrative each time because, without central characters to limit you, you can follow whoever you like over the course of two hours. The unfortunate side effect of such attention to detail being that certain audience members opt to chuckle loudly at random moments in an effort to suggest that they've spotted something you missed. Perhaps they did, but that's no justification for Todd Phillips' style guffaws every time someone spots a modestly amusing bit.Chomet's film has its merits. It's a beautiful combination of 2D and 3D animation. He also manages to tell a story with little dialogue. My appreciation ends there. As is the case with copyright law, sweat of the brow or attention to detail is simply not enough. Though labeled as such, this is not a fitting tribute to Tati. It ignores everything that comprised the man's work during the last thirty years of his life.Bluntly, Tati would never have set the camera so close to his subjects. He would not have produced a film where the bulk of the shots only concern one character or group. He would not have turned to the past just to hook audiences. His work was always set in the present. His magician would not have drawn so closely on Hulot's trademarks. He would not have taken kindly to way the film draws on heavily on the quirks of ""Amélie"" (or worse, Jeunet's subsequent ""A Very Long Engagement"") to characterize the surrogate daughter.That this film came to fruition at all is justification for any artist to consider burning their manuscripts on their deathbed. And then I came home. And then I read up on the film's history. And then I got mad.I'm well aware that when analyzing art of any sort, it is often advisable to let the work stand on its own. How else has Polanski maintained a career? In the case of ""The Illusionist"", I just can't look at it objectively. This is on par with Courtney Love's peddling of Cobain's private journals. Please refer to Roger Ebert's link below for the entirety of the story communicated by Tati's grandson.h t t p ://tinyurl.com/4pjr3vj"
31,The Illusionist,4,25 March 2011,Sorry to say it: beautiful but just plain dull,"The animation was technically superb, the characters well drawn (no pun intended), the scenery and settings were well chosen.But this doesn't compensate for the fact that the story is dull, clichéd, mostly predictable and above all it's boring to the extent that it took me three days to sit through it because I simply lost interest in these cardboard cutout characters.I see that most of the reviews are from people who live in Edinburgh and attended the IEFF premier. I can definitely understand the ratings given that the film is beautiful and set in the place where you live. I'm always swayed to give high ratings to films that depict Prague in the best possible light so have no complaints there.I'm no fan of the MTV generation's three second attention span, and no fan of Michael Bay's assault on the senses type malarkey, but this film has no real substance. Its view on life harks back to a time where nuance and gentility were revered and admired, so although we would all (well me for a start) would love this to still be the case, it just isn't.So for fans of escapism with a looong attention span and a love for Tati and Edinburgh, then this will probably work for you.For me it was overlong, largely boring, facile and ultimately dull.Cheers, Will"
32,The Illusionist,3,30 May 2011,Beautiful art; depressing outcome,"This is more of an opinion, because previous posts did a great job of reviewing this movie. The great: beautiful artwork and animation. I loved the water-color look of the scenes. The good: individual scenes of magic and characters (such as the acrobats--very cute). Bad: Picking the rabbit up by the ears (a well-known no-no), the relationship between the magician and the gold-digging girl, and the ending. My husband is a professional magician, and he laments the lack of popularity for the craft in our area; however, a real magician constantly improves his work, adds to his illusions, and never, never gives up. This movie made the magician seem like he didn't really care that much about his profession. He was able to work sometimes, so he should not have given up. For a movie we looked forward to seeing for quite a while, we were very disappointed and kind of depressed."
33,The Illusionist,7,30 August 2010,JB Priestley would approve,"If you are familiar with JB Priestley's novel ""The Good Companions"" you will recognise the story arc. The Illusionist (magician) is condemned to suffer the decline in his brand of entertainment after years of hard graft. At times, this film hardly seems like animation, so authentic is the feel. Edinburgh, of course, is depicted in the most glorious water colour tones. A joy to see landmarks so lovingly reproduced. The two main characters have all the attributes the BelleVue Rendezvous crew know how to show. Delightful. You even get the tantalising sight of the Scotsman's kilt flying in the air - just enough to suggest what might be under there - as happens in real life. It's a shame there aren't more humorous takes like this as the overall story is very morose. BelleVue was very uplifting whereas this is quite depressing - despite the great art and production qualities. The story is a little 'off', not quite hitting the sweet spot and too thin to account for the massive five year effort taken in producing it. Worthy, beautiful and 10 minutes too long. Something to savour alone."
34,The Illusionist,9,20 August 2010,Absorbing,"I really enjoyed this and found it absorbing. Edinburgh looks great and it certainly captures the old unreconstructed dark Edinburgh of yesteryear before all the urban renewal.Apart from the animation and backgrounds the beauty of the film lies in its wistfulness and elegiac quality, what it doesn't say and the questions it raises - why did the girl go away with the illusionist? Does she think he really is magic or is she a cynical parasite? I loved the laird - his joie de vivre! and what a lovely touch that Tati's Mon Oncle was playing at The Cameo picture house near the end - I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this.I have read a few reviews where people had lumps in throats/tears in eyes at the end but the only time I felt that was when he released the rabbit. Thank goodness it managed to survive and integrate (touch of fantasy there though of course)."
35,The Illusionist,2,18 October 2011,Thoughtful. Slow. Plodding. Boring. Disappointing.,"We rented this for our family to watch on a quiet Sunday evening. Before the end of the movie 3 of 4 children had wandered away as well as Dad. This show is a complete dud for children. Don't bother. For adults, it's slightly more entertaining. It has a way of making you curious as to what will happen next. Don't mistake curious for excitement, comedy, drama or anything other than a wondering feeling about how it will all end. The temptation to jump to the final scenes is strong.The clerks at Blockbuster recommended it for a family. They must have not liked us or something."
36,The Illusionist,9,6 September 2010,Beautiful. Gentle pacing of a bittersweet story.,"Saw this at the weekend. A beautiful tale of the two main characters, set in a Scottish countryside view that has not been seen for many years.Gorgeous colours and a delicate mix of hand drawn and CGI animation.However what I enjoyed was the subtext story of the fine (and often stark) comparisons made between the old cultures (Music hall) and the new cultures (Pop Music, TV). Gloriously encapsulated in the scene where Illusionist is made to wait for the ""popular beat combo"" to finish before his performance. That small scene, for me, is a metaphor for the rest of the film - demonstrating the dying of one culture and excitement and emergence of another culture.What I love about these types of films - is the plot is not predicable. There are several unexpected scenes that are thrown up in the development of the story. The night-time garage worker scene/sub-plot story is a fine case in point.The ""bedsit/nomadic"" lifestyle of ""performing artists"" is also clearly shown and again reinforces the dying genre of the performing artists - the linear shots of the shop window with decreasing price items really emphasises this.Just a deliciously framed and delivered film. A+"
37,The Illusionist,5,27 April 2013,"Visually lovely, but lacking solid story","I must admit my cinematic prejudice up front: I prefer the faster pace of most American films. Having seen 'Belleville,' I was prepared for a) a visual masterpiece of hand-made animation, and b) the glacial tempo and somber mood of 'The Illutionist.' The characters mumble their way through a plot stretched so thin it becomes tedious. The minute details of travel, hotel rooms, and the streets of Scotland's capital are rendered so beautifully it almost makes up for the melancholy and ultimately deflating story. And I have to add, in all honesty, that many French films I've seen do not seem to know how to complete themselves, with awkward and abrupt endings that leave me dissatisfied. So it is with this film: lovely to look at, but little happens to engage my yearning for robust storytelling."
38,The Illusionist,,1 November 2011,A gorgeous painting,"This is a beautiful film insofar as each and every scene is a work of art. A visual treat for the eye, one to be brought out and savored from time to time. The story is nothing special, The late M. Tati (under his real name of Tatischeff) is...an animated M. Hulot. Tati films are trying at best, but at the same time fascinating as we watch the inept M. Tati stumble about, always out of step with his surroundings. As the Illusionist he is M. Hulot in the persona of an aging magician who, along with his contemporaries, finds less and less work in the '50s as vaudeville writhes in its death throes while rock and roll takes center stage. A ventriloquist has to pawn his dummy (which the pawnbroker can't even sell, finally offering it free to no takers). A clown nearly commits suicide, and M. Tatischeff finally gives up everything, frees his rabbit, and travels off into the sunset. There is a tender (almost) love story throughout the film, but it's a love destined never to flower as life goes its course. The real star of the film is, again, the scenery. It is perfect, every scene a masterpiece down to the slightest detail. Supposedly this is in three languages with no subtitles, but as in M. Hulot's other misadventures, you can't understand 94% of what anyone says anyhow. You don't need to and you aren't intended to. As in a topnotch silent film, facial expressions, body language and gestures impart a perfect understanding to every action throughout the film. Slow, yes, but all the more time to savor the wonderful and colorful backgrounds. A film to keep on the shelf for yearly viewing."
39,The Illusionist,8,16 October 2011,An engaging and beautifully animated film from a script by Jaques Tati,"I had heard quite a lot of praise for this one when it came out and so it found its way onto 'The List'. When it aired on TV this week it was time to cross it off and enjoy this engaging and quite charming animation. There is a lot to admire about this film, but I will fill you in on that after this very brief summary.In the late 1950's many old music hall acts found it much harder to find work; with the arrival of TV and rock and roll, the world was changing. One of the victims of these changes is the main character of this film, The Illusionist. Finding it hard to find work in his native Paris he crosses the English Channel and looks for employment in London. There he meets a wealthy Scottish man who books him to entertain at a small pub in the Western Isles of Scotland. He goes down well and whilst there he befriends a girl, Alice. She is so taken with him that when time came for him to leave; she stowed away and went with him. Making their way to Edinburgh, this unlikely pair begins a series of adventures that will change the world for both of them. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police will be confiscating that rabbit I keep in my hat.Made in a silent movie style, there is very much reliance on the visuals to convey the story. It didn't always quite come off (for me), but it was beautiful to look at and quite an engaging and gentle, if slightly bittersweet, story. As there was no dialogue, as such, I won't do my usual round up of the acting talent this time. Instead I'll hand out praise to the animators, sadly too numerous to mention here, who did a really great job (IMO), so hats off to those guys.If you're in the mood for a gentle Comedy/Drama that won't stretch your grey cells too much then I can highly recommend this one. Adding to the enjoyment is a lovely musical score by Sylvain Chomet which really sets the tone and suits the visuals really well. The only thing, I found, that let it down was the fact that the plot did get a little confused in the middle, but it does sort itself out again by the end. I loved the rather aggressive rabbit, a great piece of observational comedy. Over all, if you're in the mood Recommended.My Score: 7.7/10.IMDb Score: 7.6/10 (based on 9,728 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 90/100 (based on 116 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."
40,The Illusionist,7,21 April 2011,The Illusionist,"From the makers and the director of Belleville Rendez-Vous, Sylvain Chomet, there was a mention of this new cartoon film on Film 2010 with Jonathan Ross, and it looked like something I should see, so I did. Basically set in the 1950's, Tatischeff The Illusionist (Jean-Claude Donda, when he talks) is one of a dying breed of stage entertainers who performs as a magician with simple tricks involving rabbits, flowers and stuff. His thunder is being stolen from the more popular stage acts such as the emerging pop groups, rock stars and singers, and this means he has to accept any work he can, no matter how small and how many people watching him. He accepts work in the big theatres with only a couple of people in the audience, run down theatres, garden parties, bars and other obscure places. One person who enjoys and admires Tatischeff's illusions is young female fan and cleaning girl Alice (Eilidh Rankin, when she talks), and she follows him all the way while he looks for work in Edinburgh, Scotland. He does enjoy her company and knows that she is not very fortunate with her fortunes, so with the little work he gets he provides her with whatever she wants or needs, including a new shoes and fur coat. Tatischeff finds little odd jobs such as cleaning cars, and he also performs every night in a run down hotel with other fading performers, including a lonely ventriloquist, a depressed and suicidal clown, and a trio of twin acrobats. Over time it is apparent that he may have changed Alice as a person, and not all in the good way, she believes all his tricks are real magic and he can't bring himself to tell her it is all just illusions. In the end Tatischeff moves on back to Europe, leaving a message for Alice saying ""Magicians do not exist"" but she seems to have moved on at the same time finding a boyfriend, looking longingly at a photo we never get to see. The animation, old-styled but distinctive, has some good highlights, there is minimal dialogue it is almost silent apart from the sound effects, it is an unusual story with both light and dark moments, it is slight but in moments interesting animated drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Very good!"
41,The Illusionist,,28 November 2013,Momento Mori,"""The Illusionist"" works best if one is familiar with the life and work of French mime, comedian and director Jacques Tati. Tati, responsible for such films as ""Mon Oncle"" and ""Play Time"", died in 1982. After his death, one of his unproduced scripts surfaced. This script was originally dedicated to Tati's estranged daughter, whom the elderly man wished to reconnect with.Bringing Tati's script to life, decades after its author's death, is director Sylvain Chomet. A French animator, Chomet shifts Tati's story from Czechoslovaki to Scotland, and embalms it in a tone of melancholia. His plot? A veteran magician, Tati, notices that interest in his profession is slowly dying. In an attempt to prolong his career, Tati moves from Europe to Scotland, where he performs for drunks and louts. Here he meets Alice, a young girl who believes Tati to be a practitioner of genuine magic. Whilst Chomet's film tells Tati's straightforward tale of a man symbolically reconnecting with his daughter, it also goes further. It reincarnates Tati, not as his famous alter ego Monsieur Hulot, but as the ""literal"" Jacques Tati, now fragile, vulnerable and ageing. Chomet also replicates the style and tone of Tati's films, not only as homage, but as eulogy. The film then climaxes with the lights going off in magic parlours and theatre houses, an era dying and perhaps entire art-forms with it (hand drawn animation, silent comedy etc).Unlike most contemporary animated features, ""The Illusionist"" is slow, tranquil and bathed in existential ennui. The film recalls Altman's ""A Prairie Home Companion"", Chomet portraying Scotland as a world of cold exteriors and warm interiors, the latter lit only by communal bands of artists. Elsewhere Chomet paints the contemporary world as being jaded and desensitised to art. His film is filled with shunned divas, scorned ventriloquists, dying vaudeville actors and clowns being beaten to the point of death. ""Magicians do not exist,"" characters say, their lines typifying a culture which no longer believes in the power of art, let alone shared, human experience, certain social and moral rituals having being supplanted by ""progress"". For Chomet, reality is unbearable. And reality without foot-soldiers like Tati is only worse.8/10 - Worth two viewings. See Chaplin's ""Limelight""."
42,The Illusionist,10,18 March 2013,Melancholic,"Oh man, what a beautiful little movie - full of heart, laughter, charm and sadness. Since I watched Triplets of Belleville I've been bewitched by Sylvain Chomet's brand of simplistic beauty. Like the silent movies of the past, his movies are so character-driven to the point that language isn't even a barrier; in fact most of his characters don't even speak, their actions and body language do all the talking. The Illusionist tells the story of a once-great magician from Paris who's stuck in a rut while the world around him has changed and become cynical; people are more interested in rock bands than magic. He travels to Britain in the hopes of plying his trade, but he finds that Britain is much the same as France; his is a dying art. He travels north to remote areas of Scotland where he finds some people are still amused by his tricks and he befriends a young girl who eventually accompanies him on his travels. Eventually the magician and the girl reach Edinburgh, where he tries to scratch out a living by performing magic where and when he can and doing odd jobs on the side. The characters are so deep and rich, the animation and settings are so moody and atmospheric, more emotion and life comes through from 5 minutes of The Illusionist than 1 hour of most CG animated movies out there just now. As the movie shows animated scenes of 1959 Edinburgh (incredibly accurate depictions by the way), I'm nearly brought to tears as they remind me of home. Despite the magician's efforts to remain positive and cheerful, ultimately life and the world moving on breaks him down and his performer friends. When the magician departs Edinburgh, he leaves the young girl without saying goodbye; it has to be one of the most heart-wrenching scenes that I've seen for quite some time."
43,The Illusionist,,19 May 2011,Magical. Maudlin. Mercurial,"Sylvain Croment's latest genius, as a film, adapted to a superb and touching script by Jacque Tati is like growing up too quickly, realizing the magic of the time has ended, and reality begins. I loved this film, but I have to admit it really leaves the viewer in a melancholy snare for a while, that is until the emotions are rung out and there is the realization this live of the Illusionist is not an ending, but a beginning, just as it is for Alice. Albeit the 'Triplets' movie is such a dichotomy of subject matter compared to this latest Croment invention, there really can be no comparison. Sure, we still have the brilliance of Croment's artwork, pulled into the scenery as though we were also one of his brush strokes, but this time around we learn important life lessons, or else relearn them. In this case, the illusionist doest not exist in the old way but must find a new way to survive in a world of competitive flash and glitter; fast and shallow times in other words. No, this film is not like the marvel of Pixar and similar others. This film is a personal narrative of a whole new kind, and one that should be watched for its animated beauty and captivating story, even a tinge of sadness that comes with the turf. Thank you, both of you, for giving us another gift to hold in our hearts for an eternity."
44,The Illusionist,2,30 November 2010,The Emperor is Naked,"This movie could have been a cute 2 minute short. Unfortunately it is an hour and a half long. This is the film equivalent of ""The Emperor's New Clothes."" Reviewers are giving it great reviews because they are pretentious and afraid to look stupid by giving it a bad review. Well I'm here to tell you that the Emperor is naked! This movie's only real illusion is that it will make an hour and a half feel like a day and a half. Yes, it has some charm, but charm can't carry an entire movie. I really wanted to see this because I've heard rumors that this could get an Oscar nomination for best animated feature. If this gets a nomination over a quality film like ""Tangled"" I will be furious. ""Tangled"" has charm, but it also is very entertaining. This movie is boring! It feels like a student film. It is as if they didn't bother to find actors who can speak English, so the English speakers just mumble. My friend said it was like Charlie Brown's teacher voiced all the roles. Charlie Brown's teacher is charming for the few seconds of dialogue we hear from her, but imagine that through an entire movie! And the story - are we kidding here? A CHILD moves in with an older man and he starts buying her pretty clothes, taking care of her, etc. I felt like I was watching a pedophile's dream. Are we meant to think the relationship is okay because the child initiates it? The adult needs to tell the child that this is inappropriate! Did you ever want to see an animated movie where a clown attempts suicide or children beat up an adult? Then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie! Believe me: The EMPEROR IS NAKED!!!!!!!"
45,The Illusionist,6,26 December 2010,"Visually impressive, but hampered by slight script","When I reviewed French animator Sylvain Chomet's earlier film, Triplets of Belleville on IMDb three years ago, I wrote that while the movie has some visual virtues, the film strike me as an inferior imitation of Jacques Tati's brilliant comedic films of the 1950s. What I didn't knew then was that Chomet's later project would be an animated version of a never produced script by Tati brought to him by Tati's daughter (Tati died in 1982). In the late 1950s a middle aged, somewhat pathetic French magician called Tatischeff (who is obviously modeled after Tati himself) tours small venues throughout Britain. In a remote Scottish village, she founds a girl who works as a maid in the hotel where he is staying that comes to believe Tatischeff to be a real magician. She decides to move with him on his tour, following him to Edinburgh. The movie is mildly charming but very slight. There is a good visual recreation of late 1950s Britain, but the movie lacks the humor and wit of, for instance, Mon Oncle or Mr. Hulot's Holiday. I probably smiled once in all of the movie. The visual gags are uninspiring (maybe because in his films, Tati would not put them in the script but elaborate them later in the production). Regarding the script, there is never given a believable reason why the girl would leave her job to follow the magician. And what about the idea of an older man sharing a hotel room with a non-related and seemingly underage girl. Wouldn't in real life (and more so in the 1950s) the hotel called the police on suspicions of pedophilia? Perhaps one of the reasons that Tati never put this screenplay into production was because he acknowledged that the script was very weak. Still, it's not an altogether bad movie, it's only somewhat disappointing after being tied with Tati's name."
46,The Illusionist,10,5 March 2011,"Stunning, one of the best of the year","I am a fan of animated movies, and I loved The Illusionist. I even liked it more than the wonderful Triplets of Belleville, while the latter had a more succinct story perhaps, the charm is there in both. Whereas Triplets of Belleville has it The Illusionist epitomises it. The dialogue is very minimal, and while people may find the story slight in an infuriating way, I think the slightness worked and in the film's favour.While the characters are good and the interaction between them touching, the pace suitably elegiac and Chomet's direction superb, the visuals and music are the strongest elements of The Illusionist. The music is beautiful and powerful, and really gives a certain emotional resonance to each scene. And the visuals are just gorgeous, old fashioned yes but very beautiful and distinctive. I loved how Scotland is portrayed as a land of innocence and magic, while the period detail is immaculate, the colours have a unique stylistic look to them and the characters move well. What blew me away animation wise were the landscapes, which were stunningly realised.Overall, a stunning animated film and for me one of the best films of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
47,The Illusionist,3,20 February 2011,"Insincere to its source, at times grotesque","I enjoy Jacques Tati's movies, so I have had my doubts about this animated version of his character. However, the rainy weekend finally drove me into a theater to see The Illusionist, Sylvain Chomet's homage, based on a controversial, unproduced scenario by Tati. Set in 1959 in a rainy Edinburgh, the story feels like it is from a different era, one in which indoor plumbing & electric light bulbs are temperamental novelties. Tati appears as Tatischeff, a music hall magician increasingly marginalized in the modern world. He finds himself supporting a young woman, Alice, who is drawn to him for his acts of kindness. The animators have convincingly recreated Jacques Tati's teetering walk, awkward movements & slow-witted timing. With its preponderance of long shots, multilingual mumbling in place of dialogue, & clash of the traditional & the modern, the movie mimics a Tati production. I just wish it were funny.The cityscapes & dilapidated yet cozy settings are depicted lovingly, & the film has a hand-drawn look mixed with CGI. However, I found it disconcerting on many levels. Uncaring fates are meted out to all the elderly characters. Grotesque caricatures, such as a blob of a soprano in a viking helmet, inhabit the film's corners. The cartoon Tati runs into a movie theater & sees footage of the real Tati in Mon Oncle. The relationship between Tatischeff & Alice, for whom the older man may have fatherly feelings, romantic feelings or neither, made me uncomfortable. She is so stupid that when she hooks up with a handsome young man at the end, I did not think the young man lucky."
48,The Illusionist,,21 July 2011,between bad and very bad,"Being a fan of Chomet and having loved The Triplets of Belleville, and being not a fan of any Disney-Animation since the release of Snow White, but not being a fanatic since friends of mine who did watch The Illusionist before me had warned me about the bleakness of the movie, I think I watched the movie not expecting an instant classic. Here is what's wrong with the movie and I am keeping it short: - the story! There is no story! A young and selfish girl meets an old and tired man that knows a few tricks as a magician, but is definitely done when it comes to having a career. Then young and selfish girl meets young man. That's it. That's the story. There is no interaction between him and her, no sexual tension or innuendo, hardly any absurdities, no development in the characters ( with the exception of the rabbit). - the animation. Well, I could forgive Chomet for telling a pathetic story, but then he would have to deliver in his animation. I watched the show on DVD and I clearly recall the advertisement: a far scream from Disney-Studio! The real thing! Oh really? After 15 minutes watching the show, I paused the movie and said to my spouse that there is no way that what we see is true animation, but computer animated, or CGI. To my surprise, my spouse figured that out before me. And she was the one that got me originally to watch The Triplets of Belleville. But this movie is no comparison. And maybe it shouldn't be compared. I am OK with that. So why should I watch a rather depressing movie which to me is the opposite of beautiful, that was promised as true animation which to me is the opposite of CGI. And I can live with watching CGI. I loved Ratatouille, a great story, about french self-indulgence...."
49,The Illusionist,8,28 February 2011,"Bravo, Chomet! Encore.","People complain that nothing happens in this movie. As far as people living out their daily routines and engaging in minor encounters is 'nothing', nothing ever happens in any of Tati's film. I do not understand why so many Tati fans are so disparaging of this film. Perhaps their expectations were nothing short of a great commercial success followed by a Tati revival?This film is no betrayal, it fits in perfectly with the body of Tati's work. It is criticized for being overly sentimental. While it is sentimental, it is not overly so, and the same can be said of any of Tati's films, which all have a sentimental yearning for the simple life in the face of encroaching modernization. If this doesn't appeal to audiences in 2010s, then that's neither the fault of Tati nor of Chomet. The Illusionist is wonderful conceived and executed. Each still is a work of art, and all of it, true to both Chomet and Tati, resists the 'in-your-face' approach of the modern world and the modern film. If you want noise and pace, watch Toy Story 3. Personally, I'd rather watch the Illusionist for a second time."
50,The Illusionist,6,14 February 2011,There's something comforting and rewarding about a nice movie to fall asleep to!,"'THE ILLUSIONIST': Three Stars (Out of Five) A French animated film, one of the three films nominated for best animated film at this year's Oscars (alongside 'TOY STORY 3' and 'HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON'). It's written and directed by Sylvain Chomet, who also performed the same duties on 2003's 'THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE' (which was also a best animated film Academy Award nominee). The film is about an unemployed French illusionist who forms a special bond with a young woman who believes he is a real magician. It's adapted from a 1956 screenplay by French director, actor and mime Jacques Tati. It's believed that he wrote it as a 'love letter' to his oldest daughter and intended to make it a live action film co-starring her but died before ever doing so. It was passed on to Chomet by caretakers of his work and he modeled the lead character in the film after Tati.The film tells the story of a French illusionist, in the 50's, who is continually running out of work wherever he goes and finding it harder and harder to impress an audience, who is much more entertained by the young rock bands of the times. He travels to Scotland looking for work and at a tavern gig there he meets a young woman who believes he is in fact a real magician. He takes her with him as he moves on and continues to try to impress her with magic acts, including buying her expensive gifts that he can't afford. As time goes on he gets broker and broker and feels the burden of trying to maintain the magic with his devoted fan.The movie has very little dialogue and what few lines there is are all in French with no subtitles. It moves at a deliberately slow pace, excruciatingly slow at some points. The showing I saw at Darkside Cinema had multiple people around me falling asleep and walking out. If I had not taken a caffeine pill at the beginning of the movie I probably would have been dozing off as well. It is definitely a slow and somewhat dull movie but it's breathtaking to watch at times and quite lovable and charming. The animation is quirky and nostalgic as well. Those are all reasons enough to see the film in my opinion. I'd rank it about the same as 'TRIPTLETS OF BELLEVILLE', which I found myself dozing off during the first couple times I attempted to watch as well. There is something comforting and rewarding about a nice movie to fall asleep to in my opinion though (like these films). The movie probably would have worked much better as a series of shorts where it didn't have to stretch the viewer's attention span so much but as a film it still has it's benefits.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDOVPaC9JIk"
51,The Illusionist,8,9 February 2011,Delightful French Film,The Illusionist is a delightful film following an end of an era Illusionist music hall act. The real treat is the 'illusionist' of the art work of the cartoonist who have produced this magical film. Anybody who has grown up reading Herge's TinTin will appreciate the quality in the detail of this production.There is the sub-plot of a girl growing up which adds to the charm of the film also some tears as well as this pulls at your heart strings.In this day and age The Illusionist is a rear treat as it pure charm wrapped in bountiful artwork of the town & country of Scotland.A film that will linger in the mind long after it has finished.
52,The Illusionist,8,24 December 2016,"The story of its production is much more interesting, but very well animated","If you have seen Les Triplettes de Belleville, then you will instantly recognize the animation and the style. Even the story. The same rabid capitalism of the '50s, the bleak vision of a life that is clearly worse, but somehow feels more colorful than the present.The story of the production of the film is interesting, too: Wikipedia explains how it is based on a script written by Jacques Tati in order to reconcile with his estranged daughter.But there is a major difference. In Triplettes there is a clear goal of saving the kidnapped bicycle rider, but in L'illusionist there is no goal, just rampant disillusionment (pardon the pun). The ending is not satisfying anybody, with the main character having learned nothing and the silly country girl just having moved from her Scottish village to the big city.Bottom line: I liked the animation, but the story left me with a bitter taste, part nostalgia, part melancholy and part stale alcohol and cigarette ash."
53,The Illusionist,,26 May 2016,beautiful,"almost an rehabilitation of animation. warm, soft, delicate, touching. the animation of a beautiful grace, convincing message, charming characters, the old fashion animation. so, a revelation. because it propose a small story about kindness, sacrifice, joy and meaning of life. nothing new. nothing complicated. only a trip across images from past with the desire to reinvent the value of old virtues. an artist and a meeting. and the flavor of Bernard Tati's films. crumbs from movies with Charlot. and the smile with its bitter nuances. The Illusionist is only a challenge. for remind. for rediscover. for understand. or for to dream. because it has the precious gift to be pure story. not spectacular. not surprising. only modest tribute to the art of a great director. and window to a world who could seems be lost."
54,The Illusionist,10,12 May 2016,Simply Beautiful,"Words cannot express how beautiful this film is, both in visuals and in content.I watched it, stupidly expecting a live action film, but what I got... Well, it's difficult to describe.The animation is the best I've ever seen, I have no idea how they did it, but so often you have to remind yourself that it's not real despite the fact that the art work is stylised.Each shot contains details that only add to the story, and each shot is like a work of art.This is a beautiful film, watch it as soon as you possibly can."
55,The Illusionist,3,10 May 2016,The only sleeping aid you need,"This film is only 1hr 20min long but it felt like I'd been sat watching it all day. Talk about dull. Yes, the animation is pretty and it's nice to look at but that's just about the only thing going for it.It moves at a tediously slow pace, taking an eternity for any kind of development in the storyline. Perhaps this is because they needed to pad out such a shallow story to make it into a movie? It could have been over and done with in 15 minutes, instead the viewer is made to sit through one pointless scene after another and then another...I found myself dozing off 2 or 3 times during the film, and as soon as it finished I was out like a light. Anybody who can stay awake after watching this can consider it an achievement."
56,The Illusionist,7,31 December 2015,melancholy with sparks of light comedy,"In 1959 Paris, Tatischeff's old magic tricks with his vicious chubby white rabbit are not exciting the crowds anymore. He is slowly losing jobs and working in worst venues. Performing in London, he accepts an invitation to a remote Scottish island. He befriends Alice. He moves on to Edinburgh and is followed by Alice who thinks he possesses real magic.There is a melancholy feel throughout this movie punctuated by moments of charming light comedy. The magician's world is slowly fading away. It does take something out of you. The animation is old fashion. It is very touching and full of lost. This is a sad poignant movie."
57,The Illusionist,7,14 December 2015,Simple narrative yet  visual treat.,"Chomet seems to have nailed his style from the days The Triplets of Belleville.He captures Scotland, in particular Edinburgh, so well that memories of walking around Arthur's Seat and the quirky characters found at the fringe festivals came flooding back.The artistry is truly beautiful with mostly hand-drawn animations and limited use of CGI techniques; but the color work, the color work is sublime.Storywise though, it's charming yet a little too melancholic for my tastes but Tati's comedic nuances and the attention to detail had me favor this over Belleville."
58,The Illusionist,9,21 August 2015,"Superb animation, almost a masterpiece.","Just like everyone else, I consider the animation to be absolutely perfect. The film is so wonderfully French, while the colors and environments makes me think of environments in Pelle Svanslös (a Swedish film which is much better than you might think).The film is also beautiful in the way that it is not aware that it is a movie - the actions takes place and you just happen to look at it. They are not trying to entertain you, they simply live their lives.What prevents the film from perfection is that the lack of speech feels forced (to some extent). It's really wonderful that they speak so little, but in some cases it feels unnatural and strange that no one utters any words. It's like the movie gave itself a rule not to speak, a rule that should rather have been a guideline."
59,The Illusionist,8,5 August 2015,Tatis heritage well transmitted into a animated film,"Famous french director Jacques Tati (1907-1982) wrote the script for this animated film for his daughter who also died in 2001. An aged magician finds himself struggling in a modern world, where the old fashioned varieté artists have more and more trouble to find work in order to survive. He's not a man of many words but with a great heart who's trying his luck in Edinburgh, Scotland. This lovely movie was directed by the guys who made ""Les Triplettes de Belleville"". The story is intense and I have to say there is a lot of sadness and hopelessness, although always represented in a charming ""french"" way. The only similar anime must be ""Die Letzten Glühwürmchen"". This is a fine approach to Tati's work, whose movies have this interesting relationship between the muteness of the main characters, the eye for details, society and the social interaction between different people. Interesting and entertaining for all ages. 8/10"
60,The Illusionist,9,28 April 2015,"Visually arresting film with a minimalist plot, with more atmosphere than story","This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Feature, losing to Toy Story 3. There will be spoilers ahead:This film uses a script written by Jacques Tati and adapted by Sylvain Chomet. The film displays the strengths/weaknesses of Chomet's other works (Exactly what constitutes a strength or a weakness is variable, depending on the eye of the beholder). The plot is minimal, with just the barest sketch of a story. A stage magician, practicing a craft which is dying out in the late 1950s, finds himself reduced to playing backwater towns and smaller venues, meeting a very naive young girl named Alice in one inn in Scotland. When he leaves, she follows him without his knowledge, popping up on a train, where the magician decides on the spur of the moment to take the girl under his wing.They take a room at a rundown boarding house for lower rung stage acts. The magician sees his opportunities to be a stage act dry up and takes other, less appealing and more degrading work to support them until the girl meets a young man and the two part company and begin separate chapters in their life story. That's the story.Doesn't sound like much, does it? Except that Chomet makes up for the sketchy plot here by his attention to detail in the visual look of the film and the magnificent characterizations of even the most minor characters. The magician's rabbit is enormous and rather ill-tempered, the magician himself (modeled after Tati) is stiff and formal, charming and distant. The girl is industrious and calculating, full of dreams and desires and at the start of her life, filled with hope.Various characters pop up and drop out of the film. The drunken host in a kilt shows up a few times, a popular, noisy and rather silly rock band crosses paths with the magician a couple of times in the film and the down and out stage acts, particularly a trio of acrobats constantly in motion, provide some humor and pathos here and there.The film is visually gorgeous and shows a lot of attention to detail. A train crosses a river on a bridge and you see it's reflection in the water as a waterfowl takes flight. Lights shining through windows cast light and shadow on the interior of rooms and characters. The colors are striking and lush when they should be or dingy and washed out when it's appropriate. It's an animator's film in some ways. It's beautifully executed. The character designs are the type Chomet characteristically uses. Watch through the end of the credits, as there's a nice little scene at the end.This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray and both look very good, with Blu Ray getting a slight edge. This film is most definitely worth seeing. Most Recommended."
61,The Illusionist,10,23 April 2015,This film...,"This animated film is outstanding, i cant see anything wrong with it. I'm inspired by this world that was created for us. Everyone must see this movie. My first love as i watched this movie was the animation, i saw this film on my film class at school, and as it ended there were different positions on liking or disliking the film, i was impressed by my classmates opinions, at first they said that this film contained simple animation. My face fell off, I've seen every animated movie bye Mr. Chomet and i can say this was his most detailed animated movie yet, every frame is so detailed and neat. The quality of the animation was the reason i was so interested at the beginning of the illusionist. The way Jacques moved was so brilliant, off course later i realized that hist movement was based on a real human being. I don't want to ruin this movie for you, i just want to say that this movie brought my most humble and sensitive side."
62,The Illusionist,10,28 March 2015,"It might be a dying art-form, but it's not dead yet","As much as hand-drawn animation is being supplanted by computer animation, there are still artists who know the power of the art form and give us beautiful images that go along with great stories. Sylvain Chomet (LES TRIPLETTES DE BELLEVILLE) has done just that with THE ILLUSIONIST (aka L'ILLUSIONNISTE, and not to be confused with the 2006 Edward Norton film). The story is rather simple. It is about an out-of-work French magician/illusionist who goes to Scotland and meets this young woman who is convinced that his ""magic"" is real. Over the course of the film, you see a friendship develop between them as his livelihood becomes less viable as a means of support and she comes into her own as a woman. Aiming for subtlety, there is hardly any dialogue (intelligible dialogue, at least) and the images are the primary driver of the story. It's also quite touching and heartfelt. You really feel for this aging man who sees the life he's built for himself as a magician grow smaller and smaller as people now go to the music halls to see rock bands instead of illusionists, ventriloquists and clowns. By the same token, the woman has to discover that the ""magic"" isn't what it appears to be and, in a sense, grow up. From a technical standpoint, the animation was just beautiful and a sight to behold. Sylvain Chomet has a very distinctive, impressionistic approach to character design that makes each frame look like it could be a watercolor painting. Also worth mentioning is that the film is based on an unpublished script by Jacques Tati. Although I've yet to see anything by him, the comedic sensibility on display here makes me want to do so really soon. When all is said and done, THE ILLUSIONIST is a mature, wonderfully animated film with plenty of humor and heart that every animation fan should see."
63,The Illusionist,8,27 August 2014,Could have been better,"This is one of those movies I don't know what to say about. Visually, it's one of the most beautiful animated features I've seen, it's a masterpiece for the eyes and its animation is exquisite. The plot is beautiful and sentimental but I felt it was a little pointless.This is a good film, but it's disappointing. It tells a story flawlessly without almost any words but it can't avoid being boring sometimes and senseless. The adult animation genre really has better things to offer, but I'm sure that only a few can be is as deep and cute as this movie. Remember: This is NOT for kids."
64,The Illusionist,9,11 April 2014,Magician,"I recall the scene where Alice reads a note left for her by the Illusionist and the note said - ""The magician does not exist"" - I believe that is correct. And for me this is what the entire story is about.The Illusionist did all he could to make Alice happy and as long as she was poorly dressed she was happy to cater to the Illusionist and the other lot of washed up performers living in that apartment building. But when the Illusionist gives her too much it all becomes magic to her. The Illusionist is working himself to death to keep the magic in her life. Then the handsome guy across the street gets her attention - more magic in her life.The other performers are sad and hopeless, all the magic is gone in their lives and the Illusionist cannot be the magic in Alice's life. She still see's the magic in her life but the magician does not exist! His note fails to open her eyes - her life now is an illusion."
65,The Illusionist,10,8 February 2014,Romantic french art at its best,"""L'Illusioniste"" is a hand-drawn animation guaranteed to touch your heart in a highly infant, childish manner. The film's photography is simply stunning, kept simple but full of emotion in every line and color combination. Europe is comically portrayed in its stereotypes and particular habits and cultures.The storyline is touching, portraying the hard life of those who pursuit a living through the ways of art. The silver lining, though, is brightly highlighted, as the main character gets to travel through lots of places, as well as meeting new people. Parental love is later introduced, when the magician allows a little child to embark on his journey through Europe.Highly recommended, L'Illusioniste is a masterpiece that will bring your mind back to the early years of your childhood."
66,The Illusionist,10,6 January 2014,The movie that should have won the Oscar,"This is the animated film that should have won the Oscar it was nominated for in 2011. Unfortunately, the jury chose for -yet another- Pixar blockbuster, not for the originality and poetry of Sylvain Chomet's film. This is an unfair world, but so be it: I am convinced Chomet will get the Oscar some day, if he can keep the level of the Illusionist: a breathtakingly beautiful movie, the best of all animation I have ever seen on the big screen. The rhythm is different from the video-clip-like rhythm of most animation films these days; instead, the slower pace draws our attention on every single significant detail that we would otherwise be unaware of. The references to Jacques Tati as story writer are smoothly integrated. The backgrounds and characters are wonderfully drawn and typical of Chomet's scrupulously detailed and often half romantic, half realist style. I highly recommend this movie to be seen on a big screen, if possible in a theater, for it really deserved to be tasted like a ""grand cru"", a top ranked French wine."
67,The Illusionist,8,25 November 2013,Insignificantly Small Moments,"I've lost count on how many times I've seen ""Les Triplettes de Belleville"" (2003). Chomet's sense of beauty as well as of humor are matchlessly cinematic, which is one of the reasons I think he fares so well without allowing dialogue to dictate too much. (It's great, then, to see how he utilizes speech  mostly it's either incomprehensible mumbo jumbo or phonetically mimicking a language, or then it's only few words here and there that are used in the most ordinary situations, carrying little weight.)On the other hand, I don't care for Tati too much at all. For this reason I was very interested to see how this would turn out, since much of this is meant to be his as much as Chomet's.This is a great film, measured by any possible standard. The inexplicable sense of loss, not of death but of time passing, the present fading, an era changing, it's all here. Chomet says so much in so little, and he's at his best here not only in the strokes of surrealism, the insignificantly small moments that resume from time to time; not only these are great, but the actual moments of silence are a wonder. The shot of the empty room and the play of light is his finest moment, and a perfect summa of not only the film but, to some extent, Tati's career, as well, or an account of it, at least.Nowadays we might be tempted to see this as an allegory for the demise of hand-drawn animation. Considering it's Tati's script, that's hardly the case, and I think the film is much richer for it if we see it as a depiction of the demise of silent comedy  when seeing this film let's remember Chaplin, Lloyd and Keaton, and what they did. And indeed, remember Tati, too."
68,The Illusionist,8,23 August 2013,One of the most unique and overlooked animated films ever,"I heard of this film when I read TheLittleSongbird's review of it and she gave it a slightly more favourable review for it than mine. I watched the trailer and upon browsing my LoveFilm Player iPad app, I saw that this film could be viewed instantly. After having watched it, I was more satisfied with it than the trailer in spite of some aspects not meeting my expectations (most notably the rare use of dialogue, which I was expecting more of).The storyline is pretty basic where a French illusionist/magician flees France to travel to Scotland and befriends a young woman who cleans the pub he performs at. His tricks were a delight to see and some of them raised a chuckle. The vehicles and characters' clothing truly depicted the film's 1950s setting as well as some rock-and-roll music. Some of the character animation was a tad flickery and sudden, but it had an outstanding look and I liked their body language and gestures as methods of communication that surpass the dialogue, which is sparse and hard to decipher at times. Further to the rock-and-roll music, the majority of the background music had hints of beauty, charm and authenticity but one or two pieces were used more than once, which made it slightly repetitive at times and the opera singer looked clichéd with her Viking-style hat. Nevertheless, the sound effects were realistic. The backgrounds were beautiful. While those set in the streets of Scotland were intricate, the rural ones were more straightforwardly designed. There are some intense and poignant moments as well such as a man attempting to hang himself until a knock on the door prevents him from doing so and the ending where the magician leaves Scotland and the lights in the street switch off from building to building until the theatre switches off its lights. Overall, this rare find was worth a look with its character designs, backgrounds and music as its brightest spots. 8/10."
69,The Illusionist,9,11 May 2013,Jacques Tati animated to perfection,"I bought this DVD a few months ago, and as things happened didn't get to see it until yesterday. It's a brilliant piece of animation that's not only based on a Jacques Tati script, but practically has him casted at the lead. To be more precise the aging magician leading the story is an animated incarnation of Tati's Mr. Hulot. The animated character moves like him speaks like him (that is hardly ever) and even thinks like him. For any fun of Tati this is simply sheer magic. The story itself is not the most original, but the way it's being told is so wonderful it feels like an original. It's definitely a bit of animation with a soul. Both comic and moving like most of the great comedians are. If you have the opportunity - don't miss this one."
70,The Illusionist,9,10 April 2013,Reflects the society,"It is a great animated film in my mind. Firstly, many people said that the characters in this film were not drawn in a modern, detailed way. Well, I disagree as the director of this film Sylvain Chomet said that he wants to present this film in a old-fashioned way due to the original idea came from the great Jacques Tati (who was once a great actor). Tati's daughter sent the script to the producer, and so we now are able to enjoy this lovely film based on an idea from 1956. I think maybe we appreciate the fact that the producer wants the film to stand out of thousands of modern Dreamwork, Pixor animated films. Besides Sylvain Chomet thought that 3D animate is becoming more and more common and all animated films seem the same. If this film is made using the same technique, then the children nowadays will not able to define which are good films. Scondly, I know this is a sad film in a sense but it actually reflects the society. Some people showed their unsatisfied feeling towards the film because of this. Sometimes sad feelings crate a much stronger image inside the brain than a happy forever and after.... Anyways, this is a FANTASTIC MAGNIFICENT animated film. Please enjoy it rather than picking on it.『Magicians do not exist』"
71,The Illusionist,8,7 December 2012,Jacques Tati,"An amazing anime from France that pays tribute to the genius of one of the innovators of the comic genre in that country, Jacques Tati. The great man had an uncanny sense of how to stage his pictures. His humor was not slapstick, but a subtle kind of witty intelligent approached that worked well in his work.Sylvain Chomet celebrates the great Tati in his own way in a film worthy of his subject, who is presented as a model for the story being told. The old illusionist at the center of this story has seen better times. Totally ignored in his own country the magician packs his gear in search of greater opportunities and lands in England, where alas, he finds more or less the same atmosphere about the dying art he left behind.Suffice it to say the original screenplay was written by Mr. Tati himself. It must have been a project not realized by the director. M. Chomet gave the animated film a treatment which would have made Jacques Tati proud. The animation is one of the best things for this genre that came out of France in recent memory and worth a viewing by admirers of Tati."
72,The Illusionist,7,8 September 2012,This is a decent film,"This movie took the approach of films such as up and Amelie; movies which carry a strong emphasis on human connection. This picture gives us an intimate glance into the most subtle eccentricities of people and unconventional relationships, allowing us to see beauty in these most simple things. The soundtrack was reminiscent of Disney's Up, and the them was also similar; an unusual friendship between an older man and a young girl. Given the minimal amount of dialogue, the viewer can focus more on the small intricacies of the film; the visuals, the music, and the nearly constant awkward humanness of the characters. It's a good movie for a rainy, contemplative day."
73,The Illusionist,8,9 February 2011,"My 364rd Review: Langrous, almost meditative take on the death of the pre-TV world","Based on a Tati script, L'Illusionist is a beautiful take on the lost world of the 1950s before every home had a television. The Illusionist is invited to Scotland and there befriends a Scottish lass and together they go to Edinburgh.For this reviewer this is a film about a dying world, from the simple furnishings to the empty theaters it charts a transition for a gentle world to the pop world and does so wryly.Beautifully crafted the skill in the rotorscope work or the simpler techniques adds much to the charm.Yes, the plot is too simplistic, but that's not the point; both Fêtes Du Jour and Les Vacances Du Monsieur Hulot are plot less too - it's the observation and recognition of the melancholy of the human condition that counts here.Some will be bored by this, others will appreciate it more as art than film - and on that basis it really is rather beautiful.We loved its slow languorous pace and poetic elegiac take on love and the theater. An interesting film that deserves to be seen."
74,The Illusionist,9,8 February 2011,Spoiler,"This movie looks very good and the music and pacing create a very thoughtful quality; a bittersweet melancholic feel is how I might describe it. I thought the visual quality was stunning, the music really good and the way that there is almost no dialogue unique. All of this allows the film maker to make a movie of images and visual tones. The theater manager thought that the screen-play was about his deep depression, not knowing who why he was a film maker etc. One of the last scenes is quite telling -- there are no magicians. Was he saying that all movie making fails to create real illusion?I would recommend the movie."
75,The Illusionist,7,6 February 2011,Magicians Do Exist,"Greetings again from the darkness. While this animated feature absolutely stands on its own, a little background makes it even more interesting.Jacques Tati is legendary among cinephiles. He is responsible for a small, but fascinating clump of films that span 25+ years. His best known are ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" and ""Mon Oncle"", the latter of which makes a quick appearance in this film. Tati wrote the original script in the 1950's just prior to his career exploding in popularity. Tati originally intended the script to be filmed as a live action production, but he died in 1982 without ever getting around to making the film. Instead, his daughter held onto the script and eventually gave it to filmmaker Sylvain Chomet, who is responsible for the fantastic animated film ""The Triplets of Belleville"".Mr. Chomet's animated version is quite the tribute to Tatis. The lead character shares not only Tatis' birth name (Tatischeff) but also his look and mannerisms. He is a technically adept magician whose time has come and gone ... his sly skills and popularity replaced by the obnoxious noise of rock stars. He is now confined to run down music halls and finally a department store showroom window. A true relic on display ... ironically hocking the hottest items of the day.Along the way ""down"" he meets a girl who seems to worship what magic he has left. She cooks and cleans and caters to him. Her attention leads him to spend what little money he has on buying her new shoes and clothes. A sad spectacle played out in real life entirely too many times. The girl's presence does give him a reason to go on ... if for no other reason that to keep up with her whims.Of course, nothing last forever. Neither the magician, nor the girl's adoration. The details of Edinburgh and the characters are a tribute to both the Tatis script and the brilliant eye of Chomet. It is a rather sad and bleak story told with a most unusual pace and nearly no dialogue. The characters movements and the beautiful score leave little doubt what is occurring with each character and in each scene. This is wonderful animated filmmaking and it certainly deserves it's Oscar nomination."
76,The Illusionist,9,14 September 2010,"Great film, though different from its predecessor","I wasn't sure what to expect relative to ""The Triplets of Belleville"", but this film did not disappoint. While the animation style is very similar, the feel of the film is completely different. Though the plot is indeed simple, it did not feel boring or oversimplified to me, and instead created a soft, bittersweet and slightly melancholic feeling at the end.The film is incredibly artistic and detailed, and provides food for thought and reflection even after it's over. An additional, deeper theme is the fact that in this film, Tati was also trying to show a little bit of his relationship with his daughter, and explain everything he couldn't while she was alive.Overall, this is a masterpiece, though the emphasis is on feelings rather than pure logical thought and plot complexity."
77,The Illusionist,10,11 February 2011,"Breathtaking animation, and attention to detail. Blown away!!!","WOW!!! The artwork, design, pacing and microscopic attention to detail in both look and movement is incredible. From the city scapes of 1950s Paris, London and Edinborough, to the interiors of damp theatres and guest house rooms is so incredible its untrue. I'm a huge fan of Chomets other masterpiece, triplets of Belleville and was looking forward to this follow up. It is a film that if you blink you will miss something beautiful.The storyline is a little vague and has that french film feel, where not much happens but it captures your attention. It isn't as adventurous as Bellville, or as funny, but it swaps it for artistry. A few more humorous moments would have helped the pacing, and having a film set in Scotland without dialogue is a little jarring, especially when Scotland is characteristic of its accent. But these are minor ish flaws in a stunning film. I hope Chomet is working on another masterpiece, but hopefully he will bring back some of Bellvilles humour and quirkiness, but with illusionists craftsmanship."
78,The Illusionist,10,25 November 2010,Un Petit Bijou,"Tati is alive.What a wonderful feeling to see one of the great artists of Cinema alive again.This is the magic of Cinema.It is one of these movies that you cannot speak about .Just Excellent. Nothing is going on ,there are no dialog ,yet there are a simple story. The story is visual and stunning. If you are a fan of ""Playtime"" you will love it ,if not -PLEASE watch ""Playtime""1967 .I think that is wonderful to see that different directors throughout the world reach the visual philosophy of nothingness .To watch Tati is almost like to watch Ozu. For me personally-ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER!Critical responseRotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 90% based on reviews from 114 critics, and reports a rating average of 8 out of 10. Its critical consensus is that The Illusionist is an ""engrossing love letter to fans of adult animation, The Illusionist offers a fine antidote to garish mainstream fare.""In Télérama, Cécile Mury gave the film a rating of four stars out of five. Mury compared it to the director's previous feature film: ""This Illusionist is as tender and contemplative as the Triplets were farcical and uneasy. But we find the oblique look, the talent that is particular of Sylvain Chomet. ... This world of yesterday fleets between realism and poetry."" Christophe Carrière of L'Express was not fully convinced by Chomet's directing, finding the story clever, but ""blunted when Chomet lets himself be submerged by Tati's melancholy, delivering more of a homage to a master than a personal adaption. Nevertheless, it is otherwise a beautiful work, with impeccable graphics and provides some stunning sequences (based on carnivorous rabbit stew ...). One would have liked a little bit more, that's all.""Jonathan Meville of The Scotsman wrote: ""Edinburgh's skyline has never looked so good, and if the city didn't exist it would be hard to believe somewhere so beautiful was real: if locals aren't inspired to take a walk up North Bridge or down Victoria Street after this, they never will be.""Whilst also in The Scotsman Alistair Harkness commented that ""Once you strip away the overwhelming wow factor of the film's design, the absence of strong characterization ensures the end result is bleaker and less affecting than was probably intended"".Tati's biographer, David Bellos, reviewing The Illusionist in Senses of Cinema was highly critical of Chomet's adaptation stating ""the film is a disaster"". ""The great disappointment for me and I think for all viewers is that what Chomet does with the material is well, nothing. The story he tells is no more than the sketchily sentimental plot line of L'Illusionniste. It's really very sad. All that artistry, all that effort, and all that money for this"".Reviewing The Illusionist in The New Yorker, Richard Brody commented ""Sylvain Chomet (The Triplets of Belleville) has directed an animated adaptation of Jacques Tati's 1956 screenplay, with none of Tati's visual wit or wild invention"". ""Chomet reduces Tati's vast and bilious comic vision to cloying sentimentality. The result is a cliché-riddled nostalgia trip. In French, English, and Gaelic"".Roger Ebert in his review wrote, ""However much it conceals the real-life events that inspired it, it lives and breathes on its own, and as an extension of the mysterious whimsy of Tati"". Calling it the ""magically melancholy final act of Jacques Tati's career"", he gave it four stars out of four."
79,The Illusionist,3,4 October 2014,The Sugar Daddy,"A reoccurring theme of my negative reviews is my attack on novelty. Just because a movie has unique, brilliant aspects doesn't make it a great film. It needs to use its assets and ideas to build its plot, world, and characters. It shouldn't go halfway. Yet so many times I've seen films declared as masterpieces when I felt they were hollow. The Illusionist is the best film to display my point. The Illusionist's animation is beautiful, detailed, colorful, and stylized. But when you judge it on writing, The Illusionist is garbage.Yes, The Illusionist lacks dialog, but that doesn't mean elements of plot and character aren't present. These are people, and there is a story to be told. The main character suffers from the problem of the starving artist, following his dream even when the world barely cares. He has an interesting, noble motivation...until he decides to adopt a daughter. I'm sorry, but this character is a complete ditz. She looks like she should be in her tweens or early teens, but has no understanding of the world around her. She believes in the magic of cheap parlor tricks. She seems to have no idea of the illusionist's poverty. Yet he showers her with gifts he could never afford, with no awareness on her part. She's immature, and he only acts as an enabler.The illusionist could have provided her a humble home, with simple pleasures any child can enjoy. He even gets a solid job! After working hours upon hours on odd jobs, he finally finds one where his skills at magic earn him a decent living. Happy ending? Wrong! He finds the job demeaning, and quits! And without enough money to lavish the young girl like she's a princess, he just leaves her with her boyfriend. Hope they don't break up!This is a sacrifice? BS. This is giving up on someone you supposedly love. Its shameless. Its refusing to grow up, and take responsibility for your actions. In real life, he'd be a deadbeat dad. But we are emotional creatures. And with the right visuals, the right music, and the right angle, we can be believe he's some misunderstood genius, who only wants best for his little girl. I could not care, or even respect, these two characters. It doesn't help this film is horribly paced. Its too slow. There's too little plot. There's not enough personality. And I don't hate silent films! Heck, The Triplets of Belleville was fun, and it was by the same directer! It feels like a 2 hour plus sit...and its only 79 minutes long.I love animation. I'm even giving this movie a star for its wonderful beauty. I can't fall for this film's illusion. It sucks."
80,The Illusionist,10,29 July 2013,Magicians don't exist.,"There is a song by Madrugada called 'I'm Life's Wonderful Way of Letting You Down' and this film reminded me of it. The story is a simple enough tale of an aging magician whose career is not far from being over. He finds odd jobs here and there while looking after a girl who followed him to Edinburgh. He takes her in and buys her pretty much anything she wants, mostly clothes. But in the end, he realizes there is no future for them; he isn't her father, nor her mentor and since he has a hard time finding work to support both of them, he decides to leave her in the care of a younger man, with whom she (apparently) fell in love. And that's that.'L'Illusioniste' is also a film to fall in love with, displaying the most beautiful, authentic animations and a story that is as much pure as it is simple. There's some dialogue in it, though hardly any of it is actually audible, but one can easily get the gist of it - it's never complicated. What ís complicated, are the lives of these two people. They live alongside the world and they are more or less forced to live life by the day. As do many other characters in their surroundings, the hotel they stay at isn't called 'Little Joe Hotel' for nothing. It will be clear by now that this is not a very happy film (even though there are plenty of optimistic and humorous touches that will put a smile on your face), but for that I'll refer you to that song title at the beginning of my review...This is an honest tale, both in story and animations, that will slowly but surely get under your skin. It did with me, anyway. Highly recommended, but maybe - probably - not for everyone.10 out of 10."
81,The Illusionist,7,9 December 2012,Beautiful but unfulfilling,"The animation here is really nice; a refreshing change for those of us all too used to CGI offerings from Pixar and others in recent years. It is stylish, charming, and looks beautiful ... obviously a lot of care went into creating this film.Unfortunately, the plot fails to deliver in the way the visuals do. It is a classic story and well told, but the pace is just too slow. Perhaps as a short this would have worked, but at 82 minutes I really struggled to stay focused. The very sparse dialogue (French and Gaelic) is sometimes hard to understand and I realised in discussion afterwards I had misinterpreted some parts of the story for this reason.All in all, this was beautiful to watch but a little disappointing as a whole."
82,The Illusionist,7,6 December 2011,Best elements of French film.,"The animated ""The Illusionist"", not to be confused with the live action Paul Giamatti movie just 4 years older, combines all the elements that occasionally transform French movies into transcendent experiences. The slow, sad, simply story, follows an aging French magician through part of 1959 as he falls in love with a naïve, young Scottish girl for whom he sacrifices what little he has left after a long decline in his career. With nearly no dialogue the impetus falls to the viewer to tell themselves the story. Sylvain Chomet, creator of the now classic ""Triplets of Belleville"" lays out the plot through highly artistic artwork building poignant moments (a scene where Jacques the magician abandons his flesh-eating magic rabbit carries the emotional weight of Bambi's mother's death). Although acceptable for kids the movie does carry some heavy themes including an alcoholic ventriloquist and a suicidal clown; the movie appeals as much to adults as any Pixar feature. Have a glass of chardonnay, relax and let this charming film wash over you."
83,The Illusionist,8,30 May 2011,No Illusions from me,"Sylvain Chomet's film The Illusionist leaped into public awareness when it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. The ""international"" slot seems to be filled every year, with the Irish fantasy The Secret of Kells taking last year's spot. The international film actually won in 2002 when Spirited Away took top prize. Since the Academy is a domestic institution, it isn't surprising that only one international film has won, despite yearly presence of more meaningful foreign pictures.This could be another year where a better film is snubbed for a safer, popular choice. Toy Story 3 has all but taken the Oscar home with its Best Picture nomination, and it is little more than a nostalgia trip. The movie's only ""power"" lies in how willing viewers are to indulge themselves. No ""Best Animated Feature"" should be so lazy. The other possible winner How to Train Your Dragon isn't much more effective. At least it doesn't rely on scourging personal nostalgia instead opting for a generic underdog formula.Neither of these films has as much to offer viewers as The Illusionist, which is the only one of the three that isn't disposable kiddie fodder. Instead of simply presenting age-old characters or ideas, Chomet actually creates a story tailored to the comedy of the late French actor Jacques Tati. Tati revitalized the silent filmmaking physical comedy of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin by playing himself as a bumbling but harmless figure in haphazard situations. His lanky appearance and difficulty doing simple tasks made it difficult to interact with society, which was frequently criticized as being insensitive or arrogant. The protagonist (the titular illusionist) of this particular film is a caricature of Tati himself, and earns a living by performing magic tricks at various venues. His character meets a child at one place and buys a new pair of shoes for her. The girl later follows him to Scotland and the other countries he visits. He settles after a while.The girl helps him maintain a nice apartment, and he buys more presents for her. Their conflicting ideas of proper dinner etiquette, for example, lead to many humorous moments. When he isn't at home, he tries to find new jobs or performs in a local theater to few audiences. Ironically enough, nostalgia is a large part of the movie's narrative. It isn't stated directly, but the aging illusionist has to play in dives and do odd jobs because people have discovered other ways to entertain themselves. Unlike Toy Story 3, the movie doesn't pander to its audience and doesn't require knowledge of earlier films. It instead invokes a wistful, generational anxiety about the changing world. The humor is from the point-of-view of the illusionist and may reveal his personal take on the world around him. He has little dialog to muddle the viewer's opinion. His behavior could have multiple implications.Life goes on and becomes difficult for the illusionist and his adopted daughter. He takes a low-paying job as a security guard just to put food on the table. The girl, now a young woman, spies on her handsome neighbor who takes too long to get the message. He eventually gets it, and the story ends much like it begins, with the illusionist heading into a new town for a gig. Even the animation style subtly recognizes the clash between modernity and melancholy. Most of it is hand-drawn, while long shots of the city are computer generated.Chomet's earlier film The Triplets of Belleville was also nominated for an award. Perhaps his brand name will allow the Academy to end its Pixar streak and regain some of its lost prestige from earlier snubs. The award doesn't matter, but winning may encourage more people to see this film and Tati's work.Recommended"
84,The Illusionist,6,23 October 2011,Great animation but story is boring,"In the beginning of my comment I must say that animation style, technique, colors and drawings are really great. There are different, colorful characters. Especially I liked vehicle animations, they are like flying. I must add that sounds are also very good and musics. There are great background sounds and instrument sounds.Now let's talk about cons. I watched ""le triplets De Belleville"" from same director, it was totally great and entertaining but I cannot say this for this animation. It's some kind of boring and not interesting. It's not catching you like the other one. There is nearly no conversation in the animation. Story is not that good.Finally I can say if you really like animations and especially this style watch it just for this but if you search for other things like story and entertainment don't waste your time with this one."
85,The Illusionist,8,15 May 2011,It's really not intended for kids....but the artistry is quite nice.,"I was very surprised by two things when ""The Illusionist"" began. First, the DVD did not have any French language track. I know the film was actually made in the UK but the folks responsible were French. But, as the film progressed I noticed it did have French and English as well as nonsense language--though it didn't matter much, as there actually was very little dialog. However, I sure would have liked to see the French subtitles as well as English instead of ""Speaking French"" appearing some of the time they spoke in this language--especially since I probably could have understood these subtitles (more or less). Second, the film was from a script by Jacques Tati--the actor made famous by his Mr. Hulot character (who is practically a national institution in France). Apparently, Tati wrote the script and never made the film himself. This is apparent in the lack of dialog and reliance on action and non-verbal characterizations--a Tati trademark. Because of this, the film makers made the leading man look and act a bit like Tati as well.I must admit up front that I am not a particular fan of Tati's films, though I really love French movies. There's just something about his Hulot character that never resonated with me. Perhaps a cartoon inspired by him will be more to my liking. I chose to see this film, actually, because it was one of the nominees for Best Animated Feature for the recent Oscars. Is it good enough and original enough that it should have received the nomination instead of excellent films like ""Despicable Me"", ""Tangled"" or ""Mega-Mind""? That's because in an odd occurrence, only three films were nominated--""Toy Story 3"" (which won), ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""The Illusionist"".Up front, I must stay that it was nice to see a non-CGI animated film nominated. Like Sylvain Chomet's prior famous film, ""The Triplets of Belleville"", this one has a nice unique art style all its own--nothing like a Disney or Miyazaki film. I appreciated the fine line drawings, backgrounds and sepia tones. Also, I think the quality is actually a good bit nicer than ""The Triplets""--showing a nice improvement and evolution in style. It sure looked good. I especially liked the scenes of Edinburgh--it made me remember the times I visited this incredibly lovely city.The plot involves a small-time magician who is touring Scotland circa 1960. He's a nice guy and feels sorry for a maid in one of the Bed & Breaksfasts where he's staying. His acts of kindness towards her convince her to follow him. This is VERY reminiscent of a Chaplin plot--such as ""Modern Times"", ""The Circus"" or ""Limelight""--the older relatively poor guy and the waif-like younger lady. It's all very slow and sweet--the sort of film that would completely bore a child to death. However, it should be pointed out that this was NOT intended as a kids' movie even if it is animated. Few kids would like the pace, the very dark moments (one supporting character is contemplating suicide) or appreciate the struggle between paternal and romantic love between the two characters.I liked ""The Illusionist"" very much (more than a typical Tati film) but must admit that despite its artistry, it was a slow and depressing film in many ways. The grayness of the city, the music and sad plot all conspire to make the viewer feel pretty miserable. This is NOT to say it's a bad film or you should avoid it--just be aware--especially if you yourself are depressed.Now did this film deserve to be one of only three nominees? Yes and no. Yes, as I gave it a 9--it was lovely and different. However, it did seem inexplicable that ""Tangled"" wasn't nominated as well, as its style was also very, very unique--though still a CGI movie. As a result, I really wished the Academy had included this one other nominee as well, though their rules forbade it.By the way, in a cute homage to Tati, in one scene (at the 67 minute mark), the magician is standing outside a theater playing the Tati film ""Mon Oncle""! You even see him enter the place a a brief clip of this Hulot film is seen!"
86,The Illusionist,10,24 April 2011,Holding back the flood...,"I made a mistake. I had been feeling really down lately, so I figured a nice, lighthearted comedy from the director of The Triplets of Belleville would really improve my mood. Instead I felt like killing myself.In a good way, though.It's not depressing, it's bittersweet. Which means it will make you cry, unless you have no soul. The story follows a struggling magician as he tries to care for a transient girl name of Alice, who believes his acts of illusion to be real magic. He tries to take care of her and does his darnedest to keep the illusion alive because, as much as he occasionally tries to protest, he likes the attention and he needs someone to believe in him. The problem is that it's not real, and her faith in him inevitably has to have its awakening, which the two characters protract as long as humanly possible.Which is painful. This is a painful movie to watch, and amongst its lighthearted elements, visual humor, and aching loving for everything that it's doing, is a real fear that its conclusion is reality: there is no such thing as magic. This is backed up by newspapers declaring war, bosses pocketing employee's money, and suicidal clowns. You're just not gonna get the ""Let's make music with a refrigerator!"" feeling you get from Triplets of Belleville. Be forewarned.Alright, but that aside, everything else in this movie is pitch-perfect what it's supposed to be. Mostly hand-drawn style animation with a few bits of digital help, this movie looks gorgeous, especially in its representation of Scotland (which was spot on in some places, I may add), and whereas initial amounts of dialog concerned me that Chomet was dropping both his and Tati's sublime elegance-in-silence, the actual snippets of recorded dialog are as significant in their individual words as Pokemons' name-repeating stands in for real language. If there's anything hard to do in a movie animated or otherwise, it's laying the full brunt of a character's feelings and actions on their faces, and this movie pulls it off.The cards are stacked against this movie. Featuring an older style of animation (more skillful than some of the best-done CG animations of today, and I'm nondenominational as regards animation), not a lot of dialog, a sad and sensitive ending, and foreign produced, it's a very good thing that it managed to get a nomination at least to get that crowd interested in it. Keep in mind, people, that this movie came out the same year that Studio Ghibli announced the possibility of a bankruptcy. It's really easy to see where it gets its negativity from, less extra-cinematic craziness of our current world.--PolarisDiB"
87,The Illusionist,7,19 February 2011,"Sad, but heartfelt and sincere","This is the animated film ""The Illusionist"" not to be confused with the one with Edward Norton in it. While the one with Edward Norton had to do with a mater magician that is the top of the top in his craft, while this animated film is about a broke down magician that is good but isn't amazing enough to make his audience very entertained or intrigued. But he is far from being a incompetent magician. I found it sort of interesting that both films cost $17 million dollars to make though. The animation in this is much more amazing and a breath of fresh air compared to some computer animation. This hand drawn animation is just beautiful especially the visuals and﻿ has so much atmosphere to it. It literally was like seeing a moving artwork or those good drawings from childhood books move. Now this is a animation flick, but it's leaning towards the adult audiences more than child audiences. There is almost no dialogue in this, but the animation is so fluid you can see what is going on and follow the plot clearly. In fact the direction this film goes, it doesn't need dialogue and it's almost impossible to not get what is going on. The plot is basically about a father and daughter like relationship between a old magician and a little girl he met at a pub. The thing is the little girl believes the old magician can do real magic. Now some people claim this film is like a pedophile's dream, but the way and direction of this film didn't seem like that. But a father and daughter like relationship between the two. Plus this type of premise has been done in other films like ""LEON: The Professional"" but I don't see people complaining about that movie. In fact the young girl in this touched the magicians heart by believing in him and he starts to believe in himself. It's a sad film but it's heartfelt and sincere. The context may not be all that amazing, good but just not amazing. Still the animation is just gorgeous to watch and there is so much detail that is in every part of this movie. I can see why some people might be turned off by this animation film. But if you want to see a very detailed and beautiful animation film with a decent context, check this out. On a one negative side, the direction of it just didn't seem like it had to be a animation film. It's not a ambitious animation movie, but still enjoyable.7.6/10"

I suffer the same thing, which i relate to this movie. Art is a wonderful thing, everybody enjoys it, but nobody knows the pain which players suffer. Today all technology surrounds the world with big actors and visual effects, but nobody respects a joker or a gymnastic player, who are melting their body, mind and soul to entertain people. People please wake up, at least spend a second to honor them.I give perfect 10/10. Unforgettable film for me, which last till my death."
90,The Illusionist,,7 January 2011,the trick,"There are some awkward things that the market laws and peculiarities make happen once in a while. This is a film that belongs in the pocket of animation followers, not mainstream animation, in the tradition of the great studios, but animation in the more meditative tradition of the once called fine arts. Animation as a form worth by its own materialization. In other words, the drawings are worth simply for existing, we can appreciate such a film for the flavour of its own world, as much as we can appreciate a sketch of Michelangelo regardless of the whatever he is showing. The particular basic skills of each creative leader goes nearly untouched to the screen where we watch the film. That's what makes me look for author animation once in a while: the visual worlds are visceral and direct, as if the film was being drawn at the same time you watch them. Chomet is a filmmaker whose personal world is worth visiting. His meditative approach is fully aligned with the narratives he chooses. Here that meditation found a perfect set in the rainy hills of Edinburgh, a city i've never visited but which i imagine must be much rougher than this one we have on film. the narrative begins with the magician wandering through different places, different countries, until he finds the one city that suits the mood the filmmaker wants to tell.The self-reference is clear here: Chomet is the magician. The Tati double is for the people that surround him as Chomet is to us the audiences. You think the trick is about the rabbit and the hat? No, the trick is about the tricker. You think the story is about Tati's script? No, the story is about what Chomet does with it. The master self-reflexive stroke here is, of course, the moment when our animated magician gets in a theatre to find a projection of Tati's Mon Oncle going on. The distance, metaphorical and visual, between animation and the live-action film we get on screen accounts for the semiotic importance of this bit. The fact that we get to see the animated and the real Tati on the same frame accounts for the will Chomet had to make us compare both.Much has been said about this Tati connection, how it gives birth to the animated character, and how it mimics Tati in his approach. I don't make much of it, at least not in the terms that generally people have been putting into it. Tati certainly en forms the character, and inspires the moves, but the puppeteer is Chomet, not Tati. What we see are his moves, not Tati's. And the pace, and visual narrative, all that belongs to Chomet's world. But we are lead into believing we will watch Tati coming our of the grave. That's the trick, that's the illusion.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
91,The Illusionist,7,24 October 2010,Animated Tati,"I'm not an avid fan of Tati (haven't seen that many movies he made either, though his style is very distinctive). This animated picture done almost 20 years after he passed along is a tribute to his filmmaking style. Which also means, that fans of Tati will be delighted to watch this (I imagine).I didn't know that walking into the movie, but as the credits started to roll, there it was: Based on ... something Tati had written. And I think it is a very fine homage doing this as an animated movie, capturing not only the feeling of his movies, but also the characters. The small jokes and everything else. There is (of course) not that much dialogue (though most was in french and another language), plus it might have the funniest bunny since Monty Pythons Holy Grail movie ..."
92,The Illusionist,1,27 February 2011,Dumb arrogance,"As much as i enjoy Chomet's films, i have to say that he is not short of arrogance. In the 'special features' section of the 'Illusionist' DVD, he vehemently slags off 'Scottish Enterprise' for not supporting him in his plan to establish his studio in Edinburgh. In fact, 'Scottish Enterprise' gave a thumbs-up to Chomet's request and offered him 'premises' on the 'outskirts' of Edinburgh, but Chomet rejected the support, stating that the studio must be based in the centre of Edinburgh. Furthermore, he goes on to slag the quality of students attending Scottish art schools, and blames 'Scottish Enterprise' for him losing out on funding for a previous film, which was eventually made in a London studio. Who does Chomet think he is? He has no right, artistic or otherwise, to expect his demands to be honoured from another country's funding resources. He should be humbled by the initial acceptance from 'Scottish Enterprise'. If i, as a foreigner, requested support from French funding agencies and slated 'them' for not supporting a some of my demands, they would have my head for the 'chop'. Provence can keep Chomet while he continues on his journey to becoming an ungracious, bitter man. Btw, Tati's grandson isn't too happy that Chomet's version claims to be tribute to Tati's letter/script) (to his daughter Helga, hence Tati's personal sensitivity & his prolonged indecision on whether to get 'it' into production), yet the film shreds the Tati's original to pieces."
93,The Illusionist,4,10 April 2013,"Great animation, but not my cup of tea","I really liked ""The Triplets of Belleville"", so I decided to watch this movie. I have to say though, that even when the animation was captivating (beautiful landscapes, and a lot of details), the plot was not in my opinion. Maybe it is because of the fact that it is a semi-silent movie, and those are not my favorites though. The score though was great, it helps to stay focused in the movie, even in the absence of dialogue.I think my main issue, was the sense of hopelessness after watching the movie. As a reviewer in Amazon wrote, when you finish watching the movie, you just feel like ""if you just got punched in the soul"".However, I think if the movie can transmit such strong feelings, it definitely is fulfilling the purpose of transmitting a message.Score (7)"
94,The Illusionist,,10 December 2011,Brilliant,"It is one of my favorites. For its history. For the mixture of salt and honey. For the basic story as a Christmas tree on eve. For the mark of Tati and the form - subtle, delicate and build with crumbs from Chaplin first movies. For the music and pictures, gestures and steps of love. For the pieces of magic and laid of reality. For the description of fall and stripes of hope. For the old fashion style and melancholic script. For the touch of illusion and slices of way. For Edinburgh, station, air of lost place and air of rooms. For rabbit and stores, scenes and depressive clown. For faces of happiness and dust of misery. For the gestures as key to small universes and the words like looks. For the never end and the illusionist as shadow of a world without skin but with great soul."
95,The Illusionist,3,21 May 2011,Not really my kind of thing,"Well, I'm not really into this kind of movie. I don't really get what was the movie trying to tell. I'm sorry to say that. But, really, i don't get it.Why the man agreed to travel with the girl? And who is the girl to her? And one more thing, whose picture that he always looking at? Is it his daughter or his wife? He treated the girl like his lover or something. It's kinda bother me though. Hmm..Also, why did the magician told the girl that magician doesn't exist? Why is he meant by that? Wasn't h a magician himself? What made him said that? There's so many questions in my head right now. Maybe I'm not meant to be watching this kind of movie. :)"
96,The Illusionist,8,11 May 2011,A quiet gem.,"It's been far too long since I've seen a movie with as much charming detail and personality as The Illusionist, an absolutely gorgeous traditionally animated tale about an aging traveling magician and a young companion that he meets and who accompanies him to Edinburgh, Scotland. The art style is wonderful, with memorable, unique-looking characters and beautiful backdrops. The music is great, as well. There's very little dialogue, and much of that is in French. The story is quite easy to follow from the actions and expressions of the character, but this is definitely a movie that will interest older people more than it will younger kids. I highly recommend The Illusionist. It's a bittersweet, lovely movie that was obviously made with a lot of care."
97,The Illusionist,9,21 March 2011,"The Illusionist is an affecting and beautiful film, and it demands additional viewings just to fully appreciate its artistry.","Sylvain Chomet's talent is simply incredible. There are no words to describe The Illusionist, his latest film that is adapted from a Jacques Tati screenplay. In case you are wondering, Tati was one of the great French directors who made his name in the 1950s and 1960s with acclaimed comedies such as Mon Oncle (1958) and Playtime (1967). Combining Tati's sensitive yet humorous observations of society with Chomet's traditional hand-drawn animation, The Illusionist is an affecting and beautiful film, and it demands additional viewings just to fully appreciate its artistry.The Illusionist tells the story of an old, struggling French magician who finds it hard to get anyone to watch him perform tricks. He goes around Europe, trying to earn a living, and chances upon a Scottish girl, Alice, who is enthralled by his illusions, thinking they are real. She follows him to London, where they stay in a small hotel. The magician buys her new clothes and shoes, and she cooks for him soup. A seemingly simple plot slowly builds up, with the help of colorful supporting characters and the picturesque setting, into a heartaching portrait of life in the changing 1950s.While the relationship between the magician and Alice remains integral to the plot, it is the social observation that the film so brilliantly handles that elevates it into something that pierces deep into our hearts. Despite being set in the past, the themes explored by Chomet (and Tati) remain very much relevant today such as the struggle to make ends meet by artists whose works or performances find few admirers. Not coincidentally, Tati's Playtime was a commercial failure and bankrupted him, which probably led him to write The Illusionist, a semi- autobiographical screenplay of sorts in which the magician represented himself.Much of Chomet's film plays out without dialogue. Even audible interactions between characters are intentionally short and vague, almost indiscernible to the naked ear. So it is like Chaplin meets Miyazaki, and I mean it to be a loose description, because The Illusionist is not as fantastical and melodramatic as the works of the great Japanese animator, neither is it as reliant on the physical comedy that Chaplin famously excels in. But let me point out that Chomet's film is most definitely not inferior to either of the artists' best works.The Illusionist is a gem of an animated film, and could possibly have given Toy Story 3 (2010) a run for its money if not for its limited release. It is also as equally deserving of the Oscar as its Pixar counterpart. Because of its late release in Singapore, I will classify Chomet's film as a 2011 picture, and it stands a very good chance to be included in my list of Top 10 Films of 2011. Without doubt, The Illusionist is an absolute must-watch, not only for fans of animation, but for everyone else too.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."
98,The Illusionist,8,20 March 2011,A Nutshell Review: The Illusionist,"Being one of the three finalists in the Best Animated Film category in this year's Oscars will already say something about its pedigree, but alas this happened to be the last hurrah for Toy Story, and an expected win which doesn't really do justice to those it deposed of, especially when they really have qualities to justify snagging that trophy. Still this Sylvain Chomet directed film adaptation off the original screenplay of the famed Jacques Tati is nothing to scoff at, with plenty of heart put into both its storytelling and art that makes this a must watch.The Illusionist tells of the story of a French magician who travels around performing at various venues in Europe, not very popular but always being able to obtain a gig or two to keep himself going. A chance meeting with a Scottish pub owner meant travelling to Scotland to perform there, and during his stay, a meeting with a young woman will become quite the adventure of a lifetime for him, as they move in together, and seriously, I had thought it had a romantic kind of relationship brewing until it unravelled itself to be more paternal, after all he spends a lot of his money on gifts for her, even taking up secondary jobs to sustain the family income as gifts become more elaborate, and his magician gigs becoming less lucrative since venues and a wider demographics have a preference for boy band musicians.Much has been said how this film was Jacques Tati's ode to one of his daughters, and the final scene in the film probably references this more directly. And given such a personal connection put into a story, Sylvain Chomet managed to translate the feelings and emotions successfully to the big screen, even more impressively done without lines of dialogue, opting to reach out more universally through the power of music and moving image, all beautifully drawn with rich details that will serve as a feast for the eyes. You'll be really awestruck at the film's animated recreation of 50s Europe, and the various characters that come to pepper the story both in terms of design and characterization.Only a smattering of words make it, and even then you'll have to get by the various languages and accents used, with Jean-Claude Donda becoming the voice of the French titular character, and Eilidh Rankin voicing the Gaelic Alice whose spoken words in all frankness is difficult to understand. Still, don't let that detract you because the music is set to orchestrate the narrative flow, and the scenes all designed to be emotionally powerful, that you feel for this film more than you need to overtly listen attentive to the sparse words spoken.There's a running subplot that I felt benefited from the subtleness throughout the film, and that's got to do with dying trades that practitioners have to cope with, since their traditional trade is suffering from decreasing popularity, versus the tide of pop culture. There are the singing acrobats and especially heartfelt is that of a ventriloquist who struck up a friendship with Alice, and progressively the tinge of sadness permeates through to the last frame, in tandem with the theme of being neglectful of what we have when something new comes along, as in Alice's attention when a new beau enters her life.Definitely recommended stuff, and do stay tune until the end of the credits for one final coda."
99,The Illusionist,8,24 February 2011,A beautiful film as long as one is ignorant,"""L'Illusioniste,"" is an animated feature based on a Tati script from the 1950's. The film is a melancholy tale of changing times and the illusions created to maintain a sense of normalcy. This review concerns only the film itself. A brief amount of research reveals that this film was created under less than principled circumstances. While the context of creation does color how I feel about the film, this review is an attempt to critique the film divorced from the above bias. In essence, this is a film about the varied emotional nuances associated with inevitable change. As a whole, the film is expertly crafted and is felt more so than viewed.The Illusionist pays homage to the French director Tati. This leads to some interesting assumptions by the filmmakers. First, a familiarity with Tati and his characters is supposed. The illusionist of the story is directly taken from Tati's most famous character. To be honest, I did not know any of this when I watched the film. Reading done after watching the film (regarding the character of Tati) did actually serve to enhance the impact of the film. However, learning of the less than honest representation of this story is assumed to not be known. This is a very dangerous assumption, as understanding the background to the script and this film does in fact lead to a sad disappointment. A second assumption is that narrative ambiguity, i.e. a story open to multiple interpretations, is a positive. On the whole, this is valid. The film works as a piece that challenges the audience to find meaning and insight from various perspectives. That said, the required interaction is somewhat taxing and can occasionally lead to a sense of confusion or worse yet boredom.As the above hints, this film is extremely interpretable. The following points are not easily classed as benefits or faults due to the interpretive nature of the film. One, the majority of the film is without dialog. The burden of story-telling is accomplished through character expression, color choice, music, and shot composition. While this was achieved with a high degree of aesthetic and technical skill, it does lead to one feeling the film rather than viewing it. As such, the ""feeling"" of a film is something that, at least, I am not accustomed to. The experience was enjoyable but also slightly disorienting. Two, the events of the film are commonplace. In essence, this means that very little action occurs. Much of the film is comprised of walks, interactions in a room, or traveling. The choice of mundane action serves to slow the pace of this film. For some, this slow pace may mirror the plodding progression of time that one actually experiences, for others, like myself, the pace was too slow and marked some failure in editing.Taken as an independent work of animation, ""L'Illusioniste,"" is a beautiful and emotion stirring film. The story and characters remain in the viewers mind being slowly analyzed and interpreted. The moral of changing times, while tried and true, is given fresh vigor by the film. Overall, this is an accomplished work that subtly teases the emotions and thoughts of the audience. Although this film does not break new ground, the characteristic storytelling and expert manipulation of emotion make this a film worth seeing.On a personal note, researching the background of this film has some devastating effects. The potential viewer should be forewarned that enjoyment of this film is dependent on a certain degree of ignorance. As such, I do not know if I will recommend this film as it has become a somewhat moral issue for me. In trying to be unbiased, this film deserves a 7.5 of 10 rating. With bias in place, this film easily becomes a 4 of 10."
100,The Illusionist,9,22 February 2011,Hope springs eternal in Tati,"Commentary:A much different motivation existed for making The Illusionist as compared to Toy Story 3, and a hearty thanks for that. Toy Story was created, or improvised really, for big money and mass crowd appeal, The Illusionist to sweetly and gently show to a much smaller and more emotionally appreciative audience the sweet poignancy, melancholy, and raised hopes and lost dreams of life, and that after all of it, in the end we choose to go on, maybe not as great as we dreamed but we go on, in eternal hope that the future will be better in our own personal illusion of existence. A similar hope has kept mankind on this earth for hundreds of millenia when many times in our history it must have seemed to be so much harder than it was worth to continue trying to even win the battle, much less the war.In world travels I am often asked, ""why are Americans so hopeful and think that all life events will always resolve for the best?"" Of course, in reality they do not, anywhere, and this small, beautifully drawn animated film showed that certain life truth so much more sensitively than most live films could, and it also showed well our unceasing innate hope in the face of all that failure and loss. That human maintenance of constant hope within is our wellspring, our place of succor and strength when all seems lost, and I felt that silent message as a reassuring constant throughout the story and consider that gain to be one of the film's top accomplishments, and Tati's as well in his personal way of showing us that truth of life within this personal roman a clef story. The story was written by Tati over 50 years ago, but is still as timeless as on that day, just as human hope is similarly unchanged.It is true that many world societies do not think or feel that their lives will always turn out just fine, and that it is more one heartbreak and disappointment after another.....ask a Eastern European what he thinks in his heart about his constant life struggle. Then, after that, ask an African. This film evoked emotional awareness of those sad and unfair, roll-of-the-dice life situations that we should all be much more thoughtful of and try to do something positive about. Films can and do change lives. Mine, for sure.I also give thanks to this film for its exquisitely crafted, unique and evocative watercolor imagery of world places visited, the perfect and hilarious imitation of the very tall Tati's trademark body-leaning in his chosen direction just before stepping out, the comical and very French exaggeration of the physical aspects of all the characters, and the spot-on sweetness of Tati's gentle and continued innocence unpolluted and unchanged by the disappointments and heartbreaks of life. Tati accepted them as life and went on, as we all must in our own way.This story was a subtle but wonderfully effective enforcement of life's most important message to its many confused and uncomprehending inhabitants. And that is all of us at one time or another."
101,The Illusionist,,14 February 2011,Engaging and emotionally resonant,"The Illusionist is a very sweet, engaging animated film. The screenplay to boot is great, and since it's very minimal on dialogue, it works very much like a silent film. The animation, which is hand drawn, is a treat to behold in this day, and it's very enjoyable and visually stunning. The characters are fully 3-dimensional though. The music score is excellent and provides a lot of what the film needs to carry it- heart. Overall, this is a very good foreign animated film and is certainly among the best of 2010 along with Toy Story 3 and how To Train Your Dragon, and should be seen by any person who enjoys well-made films. Hopefully more films like this are made."
102,The Illusionist,10,14 February 2011,beautiful art film,"My family of four went to see this downtown yesterday, and we all really loved it! Kids, aged 16 and 14, liked it just as much as my wife and I. We'd all enjoyed ""The Triplets of Belleville,"" and ""Mon Oncle,"" and were eager to see something along that line; if you liked those, you'll love ""The Illusionist."" We did not find the plot boring, nor the sometimes sad scenes depressing. The art is really beautiful, the action and movement all amazingly entertaining. If you think the ending is sad, you might want to think again about the many hopeful portents for better lives. The range of emotional moods, dark to light, wet to dry, drunk to sober, serious to silly, make this a most lively and convincingly realistic bit of fantastic film art. Rated PG because there's a lot of smoking and a few pretty grim scenes, I'd say parents of any kid old enough to behave himself at a movie should be glad to enjoy this with polite company of any age over the Age of Reason. Don't bother trying to understand the assorted French, Gaelic & English ""dialogue,"" as this film is showing you that music and visual art are enough to make a great movie!"
