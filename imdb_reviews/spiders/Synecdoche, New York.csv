0,"Synecdoche, New York",10,29 November 2008,One of the Most Deeply Affecting Movies I've Seen in a Long Time,"It's virtually impossible to summarize my feelings on ""Synecdoche, New York."" This astonishing brain teaser from the mind of Charlie Kaufman affected me deeply, probably more than any film I've yet seen this year. I can't say it's necessarily enjoyable, because it's full of uncomfortable, brave truths about what it means to be human, and it goes places most movies don't dare to. But watching it is a bracing experience, and it's encouraging to know that there are still filmmakers willing to use film as a means of challenging their audiences and picking at scabs that most people would prefer to remain solidly in place.I can't begin to tell you what ""Synecdoche, New York"" means, and it wouldn't matter anyway, because I think it will mean different things to different people. A basic summary goes something like this: Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a morose, depressed theatre director who's convinced that fatal diseases are lurking around every blood vessel, and who decides to stage a monstrous, ambitious theatrical work that will leave him remembered after he dies. Soon, the work as he's staging it becomes confused with the life he's living, so that he finds himself directing a version of himself through a story that seems to be made up as it moves along.If this sounds like an act of mental masturbation by a pretentious intellectual with too much time on his hands, rest assured: ""Synecdoche, New York"" is not one of THOSE films. I didn't become impatient with Kaufman or his characters, like I have with some of his previous projects. In fact, this film made me uneasy because of how much of it I DID relate to. The conclusions it draws are that we are all alone in this big universe, life doesn't necessarily have any meaning other than what one brings to it, and there is not a higher power who is going to make sure our passage through the world makes sense. It was a bit of a wake up call to hear these beliefs, beliefs that I happen to share, stated so boldly, for while I'm confident in what I believe, that confidence doesn't make the beliefs themselves any less scary.But depressing and nihilistic as those beliefs might sound, the film is life affirming in its own way. It suggests that too many of us spend too much time trying to make sense of the world and not enough time living in it. We pull back in loneliness and fear when faced with things bigger than ourselves rather than turning to those who can actually help, namely the other human beings with whom we share our time on this planet.""Synecdoche, New York"" will not likely find a big audience, as most people will either not want to work at understanding it or won't like what it has to say. But if you're willing to go into it with an open mind, you might just find yourself amazed.Grade: A+"
1,"Synecdoche, New York",8,20 December 2008,"A thought-provoking, challenging Kaufman experience.","syn⋅ec⋅do⋅che: a figure of speech in which a part is used for the whole or the whole for a part, the special for the general or the general for the special 'Synecdoche, New York' marks Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut. A monumental event on its own right. It is a maddening venture, a staggering project to face life's greatest of mysteries. Kaufman takes us on a soul-searching journey, one that he is taking every bit as much as we. It is a trip unlike any I have ever seen, and to say that I enjoyed it would be a very difficult thing to say. But 'Synecdoche' seems to be pointing towards something very profound, as undecipherable as it may appear. A flawed masterpiece, and a risk Kaufman seems willing to take.There's nothing easy about 'Synecdoche', it is one of the most difficult films I've sat through. It's the sprawling story of one man's life, a tragic life. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a harrowing performance as his character attempts to create a play of realism and honesty. And even as he dives head first into his work, his own life is in a perpetual state of free fall. A wife who leaves him, a daughter out of his life, relationships that crash and burn. His play, inside a warehouse where he has reconstructed New York City for people to live our their ordinary lives, becomes a fruitless and maddening descent into unhappiness and destruction.What is 'Synecdoche' about? Is it one man's search for meaning in the midst of meaninglessness? That in order to appreciate the preciousness of life, we must accept the inherent chaos. Existence is what we make of it, and it is the choices we make that shape and define who we are and the lives we lead. Every choice brings with it a million different consequences, some seen and others that go unnoticed.Kaufman tells us we are one in a world of many. We each play a starring role in the story of our life. People we meet every day, those we know and love. Never will we truly know them, their thoughts, or why they do what they do. And maybe it's not up to us to decipher what we will never understand. We must look inward, not to others, to find peace and insight.If life is a play, the world is our stage. We only have this one shot, no second chances. We try to control our projectories, cast roles that need to be filled. In the end, what does it matter? Will the world miss us when we're gone? Life is what you make of it. 'Synecdoche, New York' dares to search for meaning, reconcile paradoxes to which there are no answers. But that doesn't keep Kaufman from giving it his best, as tedious and heart-wrenching as it may sometimes be.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
2,"Synecdoche, New York",10,5 December 2008,Phenomenal,"To start, let's make it clear that this movie will not be for everyone; I don't think any form of authentic art is. There is no flaw in this truth or in the people who do or do not find themselves moved by the art in question- it just is.I do believe there are people who more intuitively and naturally reflect inward, on death, on life- the meanings of all these things; it is a natural state for them. And I believe there are people as equally blessed and cursed to not think very deeply on these matters. I think this film will find a comfortable home in the hearts of the former. Now, of these ""inner seekers""- I believe you have all variations of folks- those that seek deeply and find beauty, connection, and great joy. There are those seek deeply and find isolation, grief, and deep wells of sadness. There are those who find some semblance of balance between the two. I myself lean more towards connection, and subsequent joy because of that I found this movie to be profoundly moving- on almost a primordial level- and I believe- in a hopeful way. Don't get me wrong, I cried many times during the movie and didn't want to leave the theater when the film was finished. I held back the wells of whatever it was that was welling up in me until I got to my car and then unloaded some body shaking tears. It wasn't sadness, though it was something else. I don't really know yet. One thing I do know is that all of Kaufman's films seem to affect me in this manner. After the initial viewing- I know distinctly how the movie has affected me emotionally- I can FEEL it. I am not capable of defining that feeling, or explaining why that feeling has erupted (it is clear to everyone that his plot and content are generally all over the board and it usually takes several viewings to pull any real intellectual analysis from them)- but I certainly am conscious of something new and fresh happening inside my emotional hard wiring. I find that a phenomenal feat in the face of a sea of art which relies on very standardized ways of pulling it's consumers in emotionally. Do you remember how you felt after Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? I remember walking out and feeling very hopeful about the nature of love- in a whole brand new way. Not in the contrived, standardized Sleepless in Seattle kind of way not to judge that- but there is something amazing about an artist who can make you feel things you are not sure you've felt before. That, to me, is authentic art. This really isn't about valuing one thing more than another- just offering great respect to someone who has taken your mind and heart to places it hasn't been before. It is nice to visit those old comfortable haunts, but this well, like all of Kaufman's films- will take you somewhere entirely new- if you are predisposed to that kind of wandering."
3,"Synecdoche, New York",9,8 November 2008,"to call it a disappointment might almost be a compliment, but I dare you to see it","Note: This works MUCH better on a repeat viewing, practically a masterpiece, and one of the perfectly sad comedies ever made... though the last ten minutes is a slog (perhaps intentionally, as it's near the end of the tunnel... but it's still unbearable).Over the course of my teenage years I've seen Being John Malkovich through Eternal Sunshine (those two the M-word, masterpieces, with Adaptation and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind near-great, and Human Nature a fun minor work), and he's always given something to chew on for the brain. He's an incredible wit, maybe too incredible, like something that could combust with the amount of ideas and ruminations and skill at defining what's important to us as people and what we want out of art. Synecdoche, New York could be seen as his life-summation of what concerns him as a writer. And to call it art is simple, because it is: it is, alongside the something like Inland Empire, the most challenging work to come out of American cinema. To say that either one is flawed may come as something as a given, but for Kaufman it's somewhat more troubling.This is a big film of ideas, crucial, life-affirming (or life-damning) thoughts about love and death and loss and forgiveness and, essentially, the process of trying to recreate and recreate and recreate this. But at the same time the intellect to engage full-tilt by Kaufman the writer, the director couldn't engage me as a viewer emotionally - at least at first. This changed on a second viewing - I'm reminded of Woody Allen's assertion on multiple viewings of 2001 that Kubrick was much ahead of him on what he was doing - but on a first impression I have to wonder, with everything going for Kaufman the satirist, the original, the sad dramatist, what the movie's audience really is. Like the play that is rehearsed for decades that Cotard never brings to his audience, what can one take away from Synecdoche, New York as far as connecting with the characters, or just Cotard?Maybe it reveals something about me just talking about this; indeed this is probably the film of the season, if not just the year (Dark Knight fanatics take note), that you will want to talk about after it ends. As far as puzzling works of art go it's great for a good argument, especially if one is familiar with how Kaufman's work has been leading up to this point. It's not exactly that the film is ever so confusing that one will want to walk out - there is a logic, in a sense, to the life imitating art imitating life imitating art etc etc aspect that makes sense. When Kaufman, as director, makes his film this time about as hopeful as Franz Kafka rewatching the Zapruder film on a loop, even the scenes and moments that *do* feel somewhat powerful emotionally (i.e. Hoffman seeing his daughter in a nudie-booth, or the final scene on the bed with Hoffman and Morton old and in bed with the house, once again, on fire) don't hit their mark - again, at least at first. It's almost as if seeing the film again it becomes deeper, more resonant; like any work of art at another point in one's life, it could change, and if one gives it the chance it does. Certainly the cast makes it worthwhile to watch: Hoffman is what he is, brilliant at transforming physically as age goes by as Caden Cotard, and at delivering subtle moments of humor amid his health-decay; ditto in her own right to Morton, who ranges from bubbly and lustful to anrgy and dejected (Michelle Williams, too, shows this range); even a bit part by Dianne Wiest is appreciated. They all help to give life to what is a big, somber meditation on (quoting Douglas Adams) Life, the Universe, and Everything.And yet, expressing my (initial) disappointment over the length (at 124 minutes it feels twice as long) or the music (did Kaufman order ""kill-myself-piano-tunes-you'll-love off of ebay for this?) or the personal problem of connecting emotionally with some of the characters as they (intentionally) don't really grow, shouldn't, I hope, diminish recommending Synecdoche, New York for anyone who wants something to challenge them, provoke thought and discourse, to engage and disrupt brainwave patterns. Perhaps there should be some disappointment; like life, and the art pulled out of it with pliers, it's not always a pretty sight, especially near the end. But it is a unique journey I was glad to take, and I hope every few years or so to come back to it, and see if it changes me, or if I've changed, since seeing it last."
4,"Synecdoche, New York",10,18 October 2008,Kaufman's Most Ambitious Film,"I got to see a screening of this in Boston, and let me admit to the fact that I consider this film a masterpiece. It is a rare entry into the market: an ambitious film, a gamble that, sadly, makes me question how much success it could garner in the mainstream box-office.Charlie Kaufman, however, is not a screenwriter/director who inherently aims his sights on the box-office or the mainstream (anybody who questions this has to question Being John Malkovich). Instead, his greatest strength is a boundless creativity and insight into the qualities of humanity, and Synecdoche, New York is no exception. Rather, it is the apex of Kaufman at his most insightful, his most ambitious, and (as his directorial debut) his most hauntingly beautiful.The plot itself is a contradiction of simplicity and complexity: to say that it is about Philip Seymour Hoffman trying to put on a larger than life play is an accurate statement, yet it completely fails to capture what Synecdoche, New York tries to convey. It is not a conventional film, but instead it is ambitious: a mixture of conventional narrative and surrealist cinema, one where the beauty of the film does not solely lie upon the plot, but the way every minute quality of the film ties together to form the tapestry.The actors all do their parts brilliantly. I am hard-pressed to find any performance that was weak or, for that matter, standard of the Hollywood formula. Hoffman is brilliant in a role that utilizes his physical and acting gifts, and he takes the character through the spectrum of its possibilities. All the other actors also performed brilliantly, although what struck me as wonderful about the acting choices are that the majority of the actors present are not ""glamorized"" for the screen. Rather, the blemishes, the age, and the imperfections that make them ordinary are ever present in the film, making Synecdoche, New York seem beautiful in a strange, ""dirty"" way. Much like a city, its majesty lies not in grungy street corners or clogged rain gutters, but in the whole image that is comprised of such small, necessary imperfections.And that, ultimately, is why Synecdoche, New York is such an ambitious, beautiful film. It is not a perfectly crafted standard screenplay, nor a perfectly executed piece of cinema. At least, Kaufman's work is not perfect under the current criteria of modern cinema. Synecdoche, New York is a gamble; a mixture of images and music and dialogue and acting that follows Kaufman's heart and his meditations on several ideas: namely, those on life and death and the connections all around us. It is dark yet funny, evocative and haunting. It is perfect in being a work of art that tempts us to find explanation, yet ultimately needs none compared to the feelings they evoke in us.Viewers who are looking to see the difference between ""art"" and ""entertainment"" need only see Synecdoche."
5,"Synecdoche, New York",10,11 October 2008,Brilliant and bizarre!,"What a trip. You can't expect a conventional picture from Charlie Kaufman, but this was super weird! So weird that half the people left the theatre before the end, either confused or offended by what they saw. Poor Charlie witnessed the whole scene and I suspect it really got to him.The film's very much Spike Jonze in style, but grander and more ambitious than Malkovich and Adaptation. The first hour is hilarious, next half an hour is still good and you're struggling not to lose threads, the last half an hour gets really messy and tends to drag a bit. It might be due to Charlie's inexperience as a director, or it might be intentional and a means to express one of the points of the film (futility and dragging of time), or the topics simply grew too difficult to deal with, but it seems to me that the last part could have been made a bit more compact for a stronger impression. Seven to ten minutes less would have helped, if that was possible.Perhaps Jonze would have done a better job in terms of pacing and craftsmanship, but the content is still really strong. The film had been five years in the making and you can feel the issues that Kaufman wanted to address brimming over. Illness, death, transience, love, relationships, passion, devotion, art, theatre, identity, hope, so many topics dealt with in a painfully sincere way. You both laugh and get emotionally affected all the time along with being confused by the twists of the plot and the grotesqueness of the imagery. You get many 'this is so true' moments that you completely identify with and then you suddenly get struck by a completely surreal scene. The film certainly reinforced my impression of Kaufman as a bastard son of Woody Allen and Tom Stoppard.The cast is wonderful. Philip Seymour Hoffman has to be singled out for his magnificent performance. I have never been much of a fan of his and I was somewhat bothered by the idea of him as a lead in the next Kaufman movie. I didn't think he had a presence for that, but did he prove me wrong! Appearing in virtually every scene, the man has carried this film on his shoulders. He has created a completely lovable and ludicrous character and conveyed Kaufman's ideas splendidly.Catherine Keener is as fun and adorable as ever! As a fan, I was really overwhelmed by this experience. I saw it two nights in a row, and spent hours discussing it with friends. The film is a bit difficult to comprehend instantaneously and Kaufman himself insists it requires a second watching. It is an amazing picture, rarely thought-provoking, and I can't wait to see it for the third time."
6,"Synecdoche, New York",10,11 January 2015,Life itself,"Charlie Kauffman's Synecdoche, New York feels impenetrable, abstract, and removed yet I was moved to tears by it all. Why? It felt ""brutally honest"".Set in Schenectady, New York, the film follows Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a neurotic theatre director, as his life disintegrates. As things slip away Caden wins the MacArthur fellowship, and vows to create an original play, a work of ""brutal honesty"". Caden, however, lives in a bubble of his own thoughts, removing himself from his loveless marriage, making connections with those around him cold and awkward, and constantly he is searching for lost time. In his play we see Caden, examine the regrets of his life, and reflect intensely on what he should've said versus what actually happened or what he believed to have happened.Kauffman handles Caden with a great deal of intimacy, allowing for a connection where there should be none, as Caden is so self-absorbed. Camera angles for Caden are nearly always close or portrait, any transitioning shots or establishing shots are also almost exclusively from Caden's point of view. The cinematography and set design mixes magical realism into the movie and gives a dream like quality to everything.After plot and direction, things like acting and pacing become a bit harder to judge. How do you critique an actor that seems to be playing himself? If the pacing is designed to depict life, is the pacing of life intangible? Or is the medium of film unable to fully encapsulate the ""pace"" of life? This is all designed to force a personal response, and I can see people having varying opinions on this film, from boring to engaging and pretentious to being exact. Tone of the film would be generally be considered depressing, but to me there is something life affirming about it, as if to say I am not the only one he feels the human condition so intensely. The closing scene of the film reminds me of a rich life lived, and the absence of this richness is stark and shocking.Thematically there are so many ideas explored in this film. ""Ce n'est pas une pipe"" to how much can artist influence interpretations of his art to what is the human condition and how do you live a good life. Over a week later and I am still trying to warp my opinion to fit round the film.A comic I read recently describes most how the film feels to me: ""Life and death have been in love for longer than words can describe. Life sends countless gifts to death, and death keeps them forever."""
7,"Synecdoche, New York",9,6 November 2012,Trapped in the simulacrum between life and death,"One thing right ahead: Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut is an extremely uncomfortable film. It is likely not to make much sense the first time around, that you are too busy taking it all in and your efforts to understand it get derailed. Many will end up repelled by the experience and don't feel the desire to return to it. Subsequent viewings however should help to value the gargantuan task Kaufman has undertaken and to look forward to further visits to that strange place called ""Synecdoche"". Make no mistake: This is no love story, much less a happy one, not a tale about someone succeeding or get rewarded by any kind of redemption. There are images which seem too trivial to be part of a cinematic masterpiece, and you'll wonder about the surreality of some scenes and the layers upon layers that stack up. But getting into the film and getting out of it again only can be accomplished with difficulty. And that's a good thing.On the surface ""Synecdoche"" is about theater director Caden Cotard (understatedly played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) whose life more and more slips out of his hands and literally rushes by in the film's narrative. An unexpected award gives him the chance to attempt something big, and so he builds a simulacrum, a life-size replica of New York, casting people to play roles in it in order to replace the persons of his life. But the simulacrum is not enough, and while he tries everything and then some in his struggle to find a sure footing, a proof of his existence between life and death, he turns out to be nothing else than the ultimate victim of his limitations. Caden's story is about the loss of himself in the imitations he created, yet miraculously this sad life eventually becomes part of something larger by just fading away. For watchers will notice a deliberately designed circular structure of the film... One could even argue that Caden might just be a character in a film, and longing for a life outside. Up to you! Make sure to watch ""Synecdoche"" more than once. And maybe at some point you'll learn to smile along with this postmodern masterpiece."
8,"Synecdoche, New York",10,19 December 2008,"visionary, personal, deeply affecting","One of the movies Synecdoche brought to mind for me was Bunuel's ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" in which two different actresses play the same character with no explanation of any sort offered within the narrative.It's always refreshing to me to see events in movies occur without the writer/director/actors seeming to feel any need to ""explain it"" to the viewer. As with (m)any other filmmakers who are genuinely engaged with film as a unique art form, it seems quite clear to me at least that Kaufman requires the spectator to meet him on his own wavelength.This is what a significant portion of artists in any medium do: they take the constraints, conventions, and materials of their chosen form very seriously and explore their own perceptions, ideas, and emotions plying the tools of their medium on their own personal terms.At the opposite end of this artistic spectrum is the sort of pandering manipulation of a Spielberg or the painter Thomas Kincaid. Their works are only ""personal"" in the sense that what is most prominently on display in their work is their own desperate personal need to have their intended message ""understood"" (and even experienced) by all spectators in exactly the same way, so that ""the artist"" can in turn feel his own personal worth has been validated by public and critical responses - ""Hah, I must be a great artist, because I succeeded in making you think and feel the exact thing I wanted you to!"" I'll grant that this ""spectrum"" is a very broad one, and I won't discount the work of anyone along it, but that doesn't mean I have to enjoy things I see as technically accomplished hackwork. I don't, and never will. I'll take an artist who refuses to telegraph his ""statement"" to me any day. I prefer works that wash over me, entrance me, and lead me down paths to new or long-buried thoughts and feelings.I feel GREAT after having seen Synecdoche this evening. I laughed, I cried, and I see the world just a little differently now. I feel like a group of people I have never met (Kaufman and the others involved in making this wonderful movie) shared something with me that was very important to them. I wish I could thank them, because I think it takes a great deal of courage to share with others things that are so personally important in such an honest, unapologetic way.I think it also takes a lot of courage for investors to throw millions of dollars at such a personal vision. It gives me hope for humanity that such a thing is possible.The Day the Earth Stood Still gave me a tiny little glimmer of this sort of hope last weekend. But that movie was like a vending machine bag of chips compared to the full-course-meal of Synecdoche New York."
9,"Synecdoche, New York",,21 November 2008,A challenging mess,"""All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players . . .""Synecdoche, New York, like the literary term in its title, might stand for all our lives as director Caden Cotard (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) attempts a gigantic stage construction of to depict his tumultuous life. Hamlet 2 it is notit's a serious attempt by cerebral and creative writer Charlie Kaufman to deal with the muses and mistakes of a life worth noticing, in this case where Caden has won a MacArthur.Caden eventually creates a discursive and massive stage play peopled by ex lovers who help him try to gain meaning out of a sometimes bleak Brecht or Beckett landscape. Kaufman takes us into and out of time and place, characters and ideas, so that to survive the viewing, we must allow him to digress and symbolize to distraction. The recurring motif of a house on the brink of burning down signifies the nearness of insanity and even death.The specter of Death overshadows all else and serves as a catalyst for the artist's grand opus. It also allows him to muse on the meaning of life and the challenges of art, the former leaning toward a pantheistic notion that we are all made up of the people we have loved. Shakespeare's notion of the world as stage is more appropriate here than ever. Artistically Kaufman is more in David Lynch land than anywhere else; I'm comfortable with that although the producers should not wait for the profits to roll in anytime soonit's a challenging mess.Caden Cotard: ""I know how to do it now. There are nearly thirteen million people in the world. None of those people is an extra. They're all the leads of their own stories. They have to be given their due."""
10,"Synecdoche, New York",9,20 September 2008,"Meet my friend, Paranoia","""Synecdoche, New York"" expands on the basic subject themes of all Kaufman's work, but mostly on ""Adaptation"". And it makes ""Adaptation"" look like an exercise for kids compared to this.It's one of the best hypochondriac's film, one of the best films on struggling with paranoia and, in the end, being defeated. It brought in my mind some of Ingmar Bergman's characters and, of course, Woody Allen's, but without the liberating sense of humor. Liberating for the characters, that is. Here there is no salvation for the protagonist- just like in Bergman's case.The film flirts with being a bit pretentious, although it surely pokes fun at nearly all the intellectual blah-blah and clichés one sees all around the art world. So, I guess it rather saves itself that accusation. If it only was 15 minutes shorter, then I wouldn't know what to nag about.It seems that Charlie Kaufman was not afraid to challenge his hip followers, did a difficult to appreciate movie, dark, that really makes your stomach and your brain hurt with with over-activity.It's a great film."
11,"Synecdoche, New York",10,2 November 2008,Simulation Of Simulacra,"In a fit of pretentious grad-school psychobabble I once sarcastically meta-critiqued a fellows students sculpture as being a ""simulation of a simulacra"" Now looking back at it... I don't think I knew what I was talking about, or why having crafted a ""simulation of a simulacra"" would have been a bad thing? After seeing synecdoche new york, I think I now have a tangible example for that expression... and this film is going down as one of my all time favorites! Kaufman & Hoffman are perfect doppelgangers! They certainly complement each other better than Jim Carry, Nicolas Cage or John Malcovich did. Kaufman has illustrated his self-reflexive neurosis in a dark comedic way that has more angst and gravitas than Woody Allen or Michel Gondry. The film was so existential and dark I swear I wanted to cry at the end but was too perplexed. He portrays his life as a play within a play and has created actors to play him self and others to play those playing himself, like a hall of mirrors. There are moments that become so interwoven that even Borges & Baudrillard would have a hard time keeping track of the characters. In certain respects the film reminded me of Shane Carruth's 2004 film Primer, in which the protagonist has multiplied himself into a stupor that he needed to write his own short term crib-notes to figure out what to do next. If you haven't yet seen it .. run don't walk."
12,"Synecdoche, New York",10,3 October 2008,Eternal Exploration of the Meaningful Life,"Rating: A, 98/100, 10/10 Charlie Kaufman explores the depression of Caden Cotard, a playwright/ hypochondriac (Philip Seymour Hoffman). It all stems from his wife (Catherine Keener), but he knows and the audience knows that she is not the cause of all his problems, although she is quite unsettling.We are introduced to Hazel (Samantha Morton), a sweet distraction from his decaying family life. However, his sense of loyalty stands in the way of anything meaningful happening with her.As he grows older, Caden becomes acutely aware of the things that are missing from his life. His focus is on himself, but in his myopic state he cannot identify the problem. So he comes up with the best solution he can. He'll make a play of his life. And in so doing, maybe he'll find out what went wrong. Maybe he'll find out who he is. Maybe he'll only continue to destroy his life.Sammy, the actor who plays Caden in the play, seems to overtake Caden's life and becomes more like Caden than Caden himself could ever be. Lines of fantasy and reality blur as Sammy makes creative choices about the character of Caden that Caden disagrees with. Then, as if that weren't enough, the role mutates to the point where actress Millicent Weems (Dianne Wiest) takes over the role. She becomes Caden's doppelgänger, taking control of Caden's life, when he is unable to cope.The film starts in October, 2005 and continues over forty years into the future. Nothing much changes in the world around the characters. The only thing that is constant is time, spinning out of control. When his grown up daughter, Olive, falsely accuses him of ruining her life, her perception totally skewed, Caden begs to be forgiven in what is a very moving scene.Not to be overlooked is Hope Davis' psychotherapist character. She plays the straight guy, nodding, asking how Caden feels. Oh it feels bad? Good! Her collection of self-help books (all written by her) don't help Caden solve his problems. They are only false remedies that Caden tries, in effort to satisfy him in his life. Caden either projects his health problems onto her, or she has problems of her own (a grotesque blister on her toe that mirrors the boils on Caden's legs).Emily Watson plays an actress that is portraying Hazel's character. To me, she and Samantha Morton are like the same person, the same actress. I only saw their similarities. However, apparently, Charlie Kaufman cast them because of their differences. Also, the characters are supposed to be extremely different. But at first, the overwhelming similarities are often confounding. Emily Watson takes over Hazel's character and acts in ways Hazel would never act, just as Sammy and Millicent overstepped their bounds with the Caden character.What is moving about this movie? Certainly Caden's connection with his daughter, Olive. Certainly his affection for Hazel, the closest thing he has to a soulmate. Yet he always manages to screw things up with her, no matter what. Also, death is explored in this movie, the idea that we're all going to die one day. That everyone is the main character of their own story. That we all have choices.Synecdoche, New York is a gross and weird movie too, different from anything that you'll see this year. That's ultimately why I love it. It attempts to show the truth through all the seemingly unimportant details, yet they are tied together in a nice bow without the movie seeming too perfect. It's offensive to many, the way life is shown, yet I laughed at the things I should have been shocked by.After this film, it almost doesn't make any sense to see any movie by anyone except for Charlie Kaufman. No one has more sense of oneself (and everyone else) and yet no one is more lost and wandering (and boy, I thought I was bad!). Kudos to Kaufman for succeeding yet again, when he could have taken the easy way out and written something more simplistic or less gut-wrenching."
13,"Synecdoche, New York",3,26 May 2009,"Director takes great concept, applies surrealism pro forma, achieves little.","When I saw the trailer for Synecdoche New York I was interested, intrigued and excited. A few hours later, after seeing the film itself, I left the cinema not just disappointed after what seemed like several hours of slow-moving, uninspiring, uninteresting, boring viewing; I was actually annoyed. Annoyed at the money and time I had parted with to sit through such an ultimately pointless experience.The concept behind this film is a grand and exciting one. Theatre director, Caden Cotard, attempts to recreate the world he lives in with a vast cast of actors in a hopeless struggle to make sense of the misfortunes in his life and analyse his own inadequacies. With such a great inspiration and a stellar cast you would think Kaufman would have to try very hard to go wrong, but somewhere along the way he does.In Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich Kaufman showed a great skill for combining strange plots with creative casting and a quirky comic edge to create profound and moving films riddled with symbolism. It is because of these films that his brand of surrealism has become popular and very successful. Synecdoche New York should and could have featured alongside these works as triumphs of the avant-garde. It does not. Kaufman seemed to spend so much energy applying surrealist quirks to the plot that he neglected the fundamental aspects of his film. I never connected with the protagonist or cared enough about his tragically unhappy life to find his story interesting or moving.Had this film lived up to its promising roots I would have spent my time longing for Caden to find some sort of happy conclusion to his struggle. I would have felt sympathy and sorrow when he finally dies. As it was I spent my time longing for any conclusion so I could leave. I felt pity and in the end I was relieved when he died.This may have been forgivable had the message behind the film said something innovative and original. Instead the message behind this waste of time of a motion picture was not to waste your precious life analysing your misfortunes. I wasted two hours of my life watching a highly analytical film effectively telling me not to waste my time because analysis is fruitless! Frankly that message is pointless, hypocritical and uninspired. I may as well have painted ""carpe diem"" on a wall and watched it dry.Moreover, having decided to pass on this unhelpful message, Kaufman's incessant tangents of unrelated surrealism were more distracting and confusing than quirky or interesting. Where there was symbolism to be found I was usually so uninterested that it only served to detract from the core meaning of the film.Maybe I have missed the point or lacked the patience to fully appreciate this film. I have asked myself this several times since seeing it, especially since so many other reviewers seemed to enjoy and admire Kaufman's creation. But no matter how much I reconsider the film I always come to the same conclusion: I wish it had been better. I wish I still had my money. I wish I could get those two hours back.My advice: do not watch Synecdoche New York. Certainly do not pay to watch it. And at all costs avoid trying to pronounce the word Synecdoche!"
14,"Synecdoche, New York",1,26 July 2009,Turgid,"The movie attempts to be deep by wallowing in shallowness, sprinkled with assorted clichés.My interpretation is that the movie is about the last 2 hours of Cotard's boring and lonely existence. This is revealed at the end of the movie as a contrivance to make you think that maybe you missed something earlier in the movie. You might even consider watching the movie a second time to prove to yourself that you ""got"" it.Main character is in the nebulous state between life and death, sleep and wakefulness, and in this dreamlike state, drags us through his remembrance of his life, distorted as it is.As to the cliché's, well, you know, knowledge through suffering, creativity born from torment... too much Xanax makes him cry before during and maybe after sex.I really am not interested in a main character's bowel movements, but this is a recurring motif in the movie.The way time passes is also presented in the most primitive way, characters tell Cotard how much time has passed, that's because watching the movie itself wouldn't reveal this because nothing substantive ever happens. This is a very long and turgid production. At the end you feel as though you have wasted a couple hours, just like the main character wasted his life.Not worth it."
15,"Synecdoche, New York",1,18 December 2009,"Dreadful, just awful","I should have guessed, when the first scene was of Adele wiping Clair's butt and showing the green colored poo to the camera, what I was in for. I love Charlie Kaufman...I love Eternal Sunshine, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. But this movie was morose, self-indulgent and just plain boring.I have a theory that sometimes film makers who have experienced some success create something just terrible, and realize it is terrible, but go through with it anyway, just to see how people react.The sheep in Hollywood often tout these films as ""groundbreaking"", ""courageous"" or ""cutting edge"". They seem unwilling to admit to themselves that such a darling of the movie industry is capable of producing something that is, well, just bad. It's OK...and actually falls right into what Charlie Kaufman has taught us. We are all fallible, sometimes hugely and embarrassingly so. This is Synecdoche.I'm in no way done loving Charlie Kaufman. I'm sure once he ups his dosage again, he'll produce something new that has some redeeming qualities. I'll be waiting and eager to forgive and forget."
16,"Synecdoche, New York",3,26 August 2010,"Jiminy Christmas, this thing sucks.","This movie is like being forced to watch a very ugly naked man take a very, very, very long nap. At the beginning, it's boring and a little odd but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it. As it goes on, however, the boredom turns to frustration as you just want to look away. Then the frustration turns to disgust as every crooked, misshapen aspect imprints itself on your eyes. The disgust shifts into anger at why someone is doing this to you. Finally, the anger dissolves into a bitter, sarcastic resignation that you just have to sit through this inane thing until it's over and you can do something, anything better with your time.Synecdoche, New York is a bunch of surrealistic blather about mortality, control, identity, the creative impulse and I'm sure a bunch of other high minded concepts that the folks who like this joke of a film would be happy to go on and on and on about. Those fans will insistently tell people like me who loathe this movie that we just ""don't get it"". The actual reason I didn't enjoy viewing writer/director Charlie Kaufman disappear up his own butt with this self-indulgent, masturbatory tripe isn't that I don't get it. It's that I don't care, because nothing in Synecdoche, New York is rooted in anything real or substantive or insightful.This fever dream of a story revolves around pudgy Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a guy with a bad haircut who's the director of an undefined theater group. By undefined, I mean it's never clear if he's leading a community theater, a student group, some way-way-way-way-off Broadway production or what. Cotard is also in a desiccated husk of a marriage with Adele (Catherine Keener), an artist who creates paintings the size of stamps. After the movie wastes time giving Caden a lot of obviously metaphorical medical problems, Adle leaves him to go to Berlin and takes their daughter Olive (Sadie Goldstein) with her. Caden then gets a MacArthur ""genius grant"" and uses the money to buy a gigantic warehouse and stage a play that mimic/recreates his own life and the lives of hundreds or thousands of other people. He then spends decades rehearsing that play while a lot of other nonsensical stuff happens, like a guy who inexplicably followed Caden for years showing up to take on the role of Caden in the play.There's also an unconsummated love affair with a woman who lives in a burning house (incompetent metaphor alert!), a consummated one-night stand when Caden is so old he looks like Hugh Hefner having sex with one of his girlfriends one last time before she turns 30 and he loses interest, an intentionally bizarre tangent where Caden's daughter becomes a tattooed lesbian with a terminal disease and an even more intentionally bizarre subplot where Caden begins playing the role in both real life and his play of a cleaning lady named Ellen who works for Adele. When Dianne Wiest shows up at the end of the movie playing an actress who first takes on the cleaning lady role and then replaces Caden as himself in the enormous warehouse play, all you can do is wave the white flag of surrender to the labored, narcissistic eccentricities of Charlie Kaufman.There are a few moments when this film doesn't suck and they're all due to the talented and skillful cast. Their work is even more impressive because they might as well have been reading out of a Lithuanian phone book as acting out the meaningless plot, characterization or dialog of Synecdoche, New York. Emily Watson also takes her top off.Some people may enjoy the sort of deliberately contrived strangeness on display here. I think that when anything can happen in a story, nothing that does happen can have any significance or impact. If it had been revealed at the end of this movie that Caden Cotard was a robot, a hermaphrodite or even his own daughter, it would have made just as much sense as everything else in the film. There's literally NOTHING that would seem wrong, out of place or discordant if it had been stuck in a scene. Caden could have been gang raped by sentient aardvarks, the role of Adele could have been played by an orange tree or the guys from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure could have shown up and I wouldn't have blinked an eye.If that sounds like the sort of thing you'd like, you're welcome to it."
17,"Synecdoche, New York",3,20 December 2009,"I get it, the ideas, laid all out, but jeeze, pour me a cup of coffee while you are at it.","Please note: I will keep my spoilers to one paragraph that will be easily seen. Please read my review until that point if you want to hear a perspective that did not love the film.Synecdoche, NY is a film that, in theory, sounds great, but when shown to an audience ends up dull, patronizing, and repetitive. The ultimate flaw of the movie is the director and the incoherent story telling that takes place. I LOVE Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, and Charlie Kaufman, so I was very excited to sit down a movie involving all three. PSH and Catherine Keener shine, but Kaufman's directing is atrocious.I'm sorry folks, but this movie is simply too confusing to be enjoyed. The idea of the movie is great, but when played out...ugh, it just really shouldn't have been played out. I thought the movie was 4 hours instead of 2 and checked my watch a number of times to see when it would end. There are a number of movies on life and death that do not (literally) require a scene that comes 3/4 of the way through explaining what the hell you have been watching for the last hour and a half.I blame this on the directing and it being the debut of Charlie Kaufman as such. He was too close to the material and therefore couldn't tell what needed to be done to make the movie understandable, let alone enjoyable.Kaufman attempts to weave an epic tale of a (sick?) theater director named Caden that takes us through his entire life. In the final act of his life, the last 40 years, he builds a replica of New York city to work through the issues he has through his life with, gulp, women. Sounds interesting enough, right? It would be if we were ever shown this overarching narrative. Instead we are shown scenes that put together, resemble this topic, but really just confuse the hell out of the viewer.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT.The movie was frustrating, to say the least. I'm not a lazy film viewer, but this one used tricks instead of good direction to tell the story. It was confusing for the sake of confusing, and quirky for the sake of being quirky.For starters, is Caden sick? Of what? Is he terminally ill? My initial impression of the movie was that he was terminally ill given him urinating blood, being frail, having blemishes on his face, and his wife ""fantasizing"" about him dying so she can move on. But then why is he the last to die? I spent half the movie thinking that in the last scene we would figure out he was already dead because of the initial impression of how sick he was. But he lived! Longer than anyone else! Unfortunately, I think this was bad direction and missing scenes. It is the job of the director to explain whats going on in the movie and Kaufman either wasn't up to task or didn't recognize it because he wrote the story.Next, why is the house Hazel purchased on fire? Not only is this stupid, it's never explained. Sure someone here is probably going to chew me a new one because I don't understand metaphors, but here's where I see a problem. The director tried to blend fantasy and reality, but then made everything that occurred ""real."" Having a house that was on fire makes no sense given that even the marriage dream sequence really happened. You can't ask me to suspend reality then punish me for doing so, which the movie did quite often.Caden wins a ""Macarthur grant"" or some fellowship or something. Nowhere does the movie stipulate that this fake grant will allow a man to never produce another play in his life (except his weird 40 year opus that no one gets to enjoy) or have to support himself financially in any meaningful way again. I'd believe a million dollars, tops. How long would that last in New York City? Hmmm. Three years for one person living. But to refurbish an entire warehouse into a replica of the city as well as support the staff and himself until death? COME ON. Kaufman should recognize that this is just utterly ludicrous to believe we should take this ""genius grant"" at face value for not working for 40 years? At least try to explain it with a line or two of dialogue. Christ, you've gone on and on about every other imaginable topic that 2 sentences wouldn't kill you.The time sequencing requires someone to explain what's happening near the end of the movie. That Caden couldn't handle time appropriately and is why there were jumps in years that were not consistent or formulaic. One scene moves the story forward a year. The next, 10 years. But wait, I thought Caden had AIDS, shouldn't he be dead by now? Move the scene to the beginning of the movie! I could go on and on: why would some freak follow Caden around for 17 years? How did Caden have his daughters diary although she left years before she could have written any of it when he was standing in the attic of his old home? All of it put into one movie just makes it...stupid. The last insult was the worst: Caden dies last!!! How in the hell did he outlive everyone? He was pissing blood at the beginning and seeing 5 or 6 doctors a week.I think Kaufman as a writer succeeds in leaps and bounds. But he shouldn't direct his own pieces because it was pretty clear he felt he didn't need to explain much of anything and expected the reader to sit back and allow it to happen. Better luck next time."
18,"Synecdoche, New York",10,21 September 2014,"The Most Depressing, Yet Awe Inspiring Work Only Kaufman Could Execute This Well.","Minor spoilers ahead.Few things come to mind with the idea of Charlie Kaufman directing. It's no doubt his most well-received screenplays have been hailed as the masterpieces they are and if this is what he's capable of as a writer/director, then any expectations there were are met as I was blown away at how ambitious and successful this was as a debut.I could write lines and lines on how Kaufman has decided to tackle almost every aspect of daily life, how we connect and identify through sadness as well as trying to ""answer"" questions that blur between reality and fiction as the movie unfolds. Ailing theatre director Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman), comes off as frequently depressed throughout the majority of his life. Early on he receives a very prestigious grant, removing any financial woe as he begins work on an increasingly elaborate stage production. Where his extreme commitment to realism begins to blur every aspect of his life, including those closest to him and other possibilities of promising relationships.When tackling something so large, Kaufman's script is very admirable. There is a lot I would happily debate as ""fodder"", yet as the film progresses all those little hiccups and moments build towards this big picture that is both extremely subtle and obvious. The small ones I feel safe mentioning is an adults decision whether or not to purchase a house on fire, concerned whether or not it will eventually kill them and how that choice will affect their life then and later. Another tackles the idea of becoming conscious of the anima & animus, to which I initially thought could be interpreted as the subconscious taking over. Even though some of that obviously appears towards the third act, it becomes more utilised as a ""replacement"" for the various characters. All this and more is just the tip of how much really gets across in this movie, all leading to many wonderful interpretations.The last big passage to write is that the acting is fantastic. As much as I said the script dips back and forth between the movie, the visual aspect accompanies all those elements and justifies almost every line. Certain supporting characters drop in and out the picture remaining nothing but background scenes, though many later become leads that really build to this kind of ""unity"" to the depression everyone suffers. I found myself heavily invested in the life of Caden, and I really don't think I would have cared for this character as much as I would have if it wasn't for the astonishing Philip Seymour Hoffman. Playing losers, idiots or troubled people is nothing new for him, yet how he manages to constantly remain refreshing and bring another level of gravitas to every performance, so far this remains my favourite of all his work. Catherine Keener, Hope Davis, Tom Noonan, Samantha Morton, Michelle Williams, Emily Watson and Jennifer Jason Leigh all do absolutely wonderful work.Final Verdict: Easily the best movie of 2008. There are a few films that I truly consider my all time favourites after the year 2000. ""Synecdoche, New York"" had an affect on me only few movies ever had, Oh how I look forward to ageing along with this movie and loving it even more over time. It's a little difficult to follow yet on repeated viewings you will definitely find even more to love and loathe, pay attention to the backgrounds. 10/10."
19,"Synecdoche, New York",10,23 March 2014,Long... Weird... Kind of amazing.,"Synechdoche, New York is nothing if not ambitious. It's about mortality, love, loss, creativity, and fear. It's a 2 hour comedy that doesn't have a single full-out laugh but countless sly observations, from the mundane to the profound.This is an art film, and it makes no apologies for it. It's remarkably confident and does little to explain itself. That alone makes it kind of wonderful.It's challenging. I'd watched the first 20 minutes and had to abandon it because I wasn't ""getting"" it. Catch it with the right set of expectations, though, and it becomes one of those stories that kind of flows around you like a dream. When I went in for a second attempt, it worked a lot better.The length works in the movie's favor. You follow secondary characters from the beginning, and the way their lives unfold (and end) are meaningful (SPOILER: The scene with Caden at Olive's deathbed is a brilliant summation of the gaps between parents and children).It's cinematic absurdism. Pretty accessible as absurdism goes, but it's not going to be for everyone. I ""got"" it, though, and I'm very grateful."
20,"Synecdoche, New York",10,9 February 2014,A masterpiece; a film that needs to be felt to be understood,"Synedoch, New York is one of these great works that makes you feel all the feelings that you refuse to feel, and think all the thoughts that you don't want to think about. A poetic film, a masterpiece that needs to be seen no matter what, existentialism at his best.It may look 'uninteresting' 'dead' 'depressing' if watched only superficially. But as I said in the title, Kaufoman's Magnum Opus(Dare anyone say otherwise!) is an extremely beautiful work, if you are watching it closely. It shows how useless and waste are the attempts of people to let something for the humanity, to be recognized, to be the 'great', while in the reality, we are all little and delusional people. We already do our contribution to the world. Kaufman'question the 'to be remembered' subject, since it's reasons and the main radix(death), with bravery and an impact comparable to Fellini's 8½ and Bob Fosse's All That Jazz.The acting is great, highlight for Philip Seymour Hoffman(we'll miss him), that showed versatility and great range once more, interpreting the protagonist, a sensible, egoist and scared artist since his young years until his old and tired ones. Definitely a great work.This film needs to be seen. It's highly divisive(Don't understand why) so you can very well hate it or simply love it, as I do. I think some people will need more than one watch to fully understand it, but if paid attention to the right things, a first viewing will be enough to get it, and future re-watches will be much more pleasant. A masterpiece, wonderfully crafted, loaded with symbolism and with a powerful message in the end. 9.8/10"
21,"Synecdoche, New York",9,30 July 2013,My rating: 9,"Movie about the director operating scenes of your own life. Our life and my life. Sparse fragments, application of inner spiritual world. How much we are alone and how much we are connected to the others? Loneliness and the constant battle with yourself. The opportunity to be someone else and not yourself. Theory of parallel worlds, self-understanding and personal history. The fragile, the diversities, the special people and the clash in which they encounter the rudeness of profane life.Fear of death mostly. Passed through cuts in the social world due to declining others. Problematical body and its denial. Resignation and obtaining the complete idea, I think.Concluding remarks: a film that is not for everyone. For a long time I thought I would need someone to explain it to me. Making life itself. Film that depress, that is hopeless, strange, difficult. Watch it or do not watch it.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/"
22,"Synecdoche, New York",10,24 June 2009,"Synecdoche, New York is the most amazing movie I have ever seen.","Granted, I am young, I haven't seen every movie ever made. But as far as I know, this is the best. It was absolutely and completely heart breaking. I was so moved by this title I cried for a half an hour after it was over. Charlie Kaufman continues to prove himself as a visionary. Philip Seymour Hoffman shook something inside of me, as he is known to do. It was brilliant. Everything about it is perfect.That having been said, I will never watch this movie again.Before you take that the wrong way, consider Antonin Artaud's concept of the Theatre of Cruelty. It's the idea that someone should not be entertained by theatre, but changed by it. I am a different person after witnessing this masterpiece. I'm truly not looking at things the same way.But it isn't a pleasant experience. It's a vital one.I can't really bring myself to tell you any more about this film, because I feel like any synopsis of the plot would be an injustice (and, well, really, really difficult for me). But I urge you to watch this one. You WILL be effected."
23,"Synecdoche, New York",10,17 January 2015,A true masterpiece of a movie. Kauffman presents one of the most mind boggling and life changing movies I have ever seen,"This movie appealed to me in so many ways. For movie goers who like to pay close attention to details and really delve deep into the various layers, themes and meaning of the film, this movie outstandingly surprises. After my first watch I say there jaw dropped for a good 5 minutes before replaying it for the 2nd then 3rd until I eventually went off to think about the movie for the next week. Thought the week after first seeing this movie I totaled up to seeing it 6 times as well as countless hours researching and discussing the movie with other fans and confused viewers. Needless to say, Synecdoche provided one of the most meaningful and life changing experiences I have ever found in a movie and will most definitely be re-watched and thought off throughout the rest of my life. To the heart of this amazing experience is the writing of Charlie Kauffman. Upon watching this movie I had only heard of his great works such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich, but nothing could of prepared me for the amount of sophistication and care presented through the writing of this film. Now having seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (don't worry the rest are on my watch list) I can fully understand the talent Charlie Kauffman has with his ability to deliver a story that can deliver meaning on various different levels. Kaufman provides one of the most original concepts I have ever seen in all movies I have seen from him and never have I experienced a predictable moment. Throughout watching movies like this rather then feeling as if you can predict what will happen, you feel as though you are riding along Kauffman's roller coaster; as he takes you exactly where he wants, for specific reasons. Through Kauffman's talented stories he also presents some of the most riveting and interesting characters I have seen on film. Each character in Synechdoche has a purpose and is cleverly contrasted or portrayed in a certain way to force the audience to see exactly as Kauffman wants them to see. Kauffman also rewards those who pay attention to detail. Each scene has various attributes that allows the audience to pause and play to take in the incredible amount of detail placed in each scene. For example, one of my favorite scenes (not a spoiler, it's the first scene) is within the opening breakfast scene whereas Caden (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) performs his normal breakfast routine. Throughout this scene it not only introduces the main characters but provides a key concept that is shown throughout the movie. This being that Time is slipping through Caden's fingers with or without him even noticing. This is cleverly done by that breakfast scene taking place over more than a year. This is a subtle trick and can only be seen if you carefully look at the various dates presented throughout the scene. It is this eye for detail and careful placement done by Kauffman that forces this movie to stand out for me. Kauffman through Synechdoche New York presents one of the most thrilling and original screenplays I have ever seen.Another big point worth noticing is the high level of acting presented throughout. Phillip Seymour Hoffman already is known as a great actor but this would be up there with one of his greatest performances. Hoffman also takes the character of Caden into great detail and presents to the audience an amazing performance in which the audience is able to understand the effects of the events happening to his character. This also applies to the other actors in the movie and I couldn't see one weak role. Each actor performed their character superbly and the movie was significantly better because of that. Although I'm giving this movie an easy 10/10 I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. The slow pace and mind boggling surrealist nature of the movie is understandably repulsive to mainstream viewing. But that being said I still see this as one of my favorite movies of all time with one of the most compelling, deep and truly fantastic movie I have ever seen."
24,"Synecdoche, New York",1,1 November 2010,"Horrible, long, and fairly depressing","The best thing I can say is that Philip Seymour Hoffman did a great job at acting in this hopeless and depressing mess. More than once I wished it was over, but I kept hoping it would get better. It was very convoluted and confusing. Is he dreaming? Is it really happening? How can that be true? Lots of jumping around on the time-line. Depressing and strange mixtures of subject matter - illness, breakups, fire, sex, death. The only part that made me feel comforted was seeing Dianne Wiest, an actress that I recognized from other, happier movies. The speech by the priest near the end was fairly moving (though morose), however, ultimately I felt this was an utter waste of 2 1/2 hours of my life. I wish I had a toothbrush that could scrub it out of my mind."
25,"Synecdoche, New York",1,4 March 2009,"If you want the gratuitous ugliness of life, do something unpleasant instead.","Synecdoche, New York, ripped me off. It's not the dollar-fifty I paid at the discount theater to which I'm referring. See, generally speaking a director (or any kind of artist, for that matter) makes one of two choices. I feel Charlie Kaufman lied to me about the choice he made. Choice one is that the director makes a movie intended to make me happy. Pretty images, cute dialogue, and a happy ending to wrap it all up. You know, like most of the movies you and I and everyone likes. Choice two is the hard one. The artist portrays something ugly or unpleasant, but hopes that in so doing he will give me something I value: make me think or feel in a new way. Charlie Kaufman portrayed the less pleasant emotions of everyday people: loneliness, hopelessness, confusion, the dull fear of death. He did it using the intentionally confusing formula that seemed fresh and challenging in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich, in which the viewer must tease out reality from fantasy. Now it just seems like busywork from a one trick pony. And he did it in ways that were intentionally unappealing. A few things, such as the anachronistic, dingy hospital scenes, I might like to describe as artfully ugly. Mostly I would describe this movie as gratuitously ugly. But the main problem with Kaufman's effort is that he thought making a movie unpleasant in unusual ways WAS the point. He forgot to give me anything to make me feel that the uncomfortable two-hour-four-minute journey I made with him was worth taking. The main character is a hypochondriac, and Kaufman portrayed this fear by showing me a whole bunch of tolerable-but-disgusting real and imagined scenes of his health and his body. I was tricked into believing that cringing through these ugly scenes would give me some sort of payoff in the end. Instead I was left with some vague, trite morals at the end. All the world's a stage, or something. Loneliness sucks, or something. People are all different or all the same, or something. Don't be self-indulgent, or something. Everybody's confused about what they should do in life and wishes there were answers, or something. Admittedly, the above could be considered Underlying Themes. If kidnapped by sadistic high school English teachers, I could probably write a five-paragraph essay on the Underlying Themes in Synecdoche, New York. So I'm sure that nothing I can say could potentially make Kaufman believe that this wasn't a ""deep"" movie. But to the best of my knowledge, Kaufman isn't a philosopher and unless I'm missing something he didn't say anything new about these themes. Sure, it's hard to say anything that's truly new. But what a ""deep"" movie can do is provoke self-exploration. When I go to a movie that provokes me in a certain way, I find myself wanting to discuss those themes with my friends afterward, and they usually find themselves wanting to do the same. After watching Synecdoche, New York, my friend and I found ourselves simply wanting to purge ourselves of the images of Caden's blood, fecal matter, skin diseases, and gum surgery by talking about hair products. I guess if I wanted to defend this movie, I'd say it portrays the reality of how ugly life can be sometimes. But it doesn't add any wisdom to that dialogue, so I'd rather be reminded of the ugliness of life by doing something more productive. Like standing in the DMV line."
26,"Synecdoche, New York",6,24 October 2008,The Living Theater Of Charlie Kaufman,"It was bound to happen. The brilliant writer of ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" made his directorial debut. Interesting, yes, without question, but self conscious to the point of distraction. Kaufman's mind with all its implications is a the center of this dream colored by illness and paranoia. Strange echoes of Julian Beck and Luis Bunuel made the experience rather gripping but I must confess I felt the need to run home and take a long shower after the film and read something funny, I selected Alan Bennet's ""Uncommon Reader"" It worked. I may even go again to see this Charlie Kaufman film with its unpronounceable title. I guess that even that is on purpose, so we all can refer to it as Charlie Kaufman's movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman is great, as usual. This time I also felt his body odor. Yuck! I remember Hoffman's dirty fingernails even when he was playing Truman Capote so I presume that is the actor's trait and not the character's, although, here, the filth that he exudes matches perfectly his story. Catherine Keener and Emily Watson are also superb but Samantha Morton, once again, got me completely. I will advise you to see it, at your own risk."
27,"Synecdoche, New York",1,9 April 2009,Do Not See This Film!!!,"In all my 53 years I can honestly say is the worst movie that I have ever had the misfortune to watch. And I have seen a LOT of stinkers.If you have ever had a weird dream where nothing makes any sense, awoke, wrote everything that you could remember about it down, waited until you were 99 years old, senile, on your deathbed, and for your last act on earth, made it into a screenplay, cast it with chimpanzees, had it directed by baboons, and filmed it.... It would make more sense than this movie.This movie has made me insane.There, I am insane now."
28,"Synecdoche, New York",10,28 September 2009,"The meaning of life, with all its futility, role-playing, broken hearts, and loneliness","Synecdoche, New York (2008)If you take the events of this movie as seriously as its main character, played with brilliance by Philip Seymour Hoffman, it could be a life changer. At times baffling, at times draining, the plot is never as absurd as it might seem on the surface. And it really does make enough sense in practical terms to make you deal with the implications on philosophical ones--the meaning of life, your life. The characters--and I use the word flexibly--are so convincing you are quickly sucked into their lives. Once the movie has you in its grips, it starts to coil and unwind, never letting go.Synecdoche, New York survives all the hoops it creates for its own logic and cohesion (including it's title) by being most of all very human. The characters are gritty and as alive and believable as Schenectady, New York, the paradigm used for these ordinary, real people, people you learn to worry about and trust even as they begin to do completely improbable things. The roles everyone plays are at first their own lives, with the layer of a play within a movie. But then people begin to take on a given theatrical role for the rest of their lives, and this real-life theater gets confused with real-life life to the point that it isn't about keeping them straight. It's about realizing there is no difference--there is nothing to keep straight. And what happens? Everyone succumbs, of course--to that last act we can't avoid. And as people die, the sadness grows, not only for them, but for us, for me and for whoever you are sitting next to, because that's where this finally hits. Beautifully.We all play roles, have lives, watch things grow and crumble out of our control, persevere anyway, get older in the process, fall in love over and over, and then die anyway. When Hoffman says in a kind of a sweeping wonder to a woman he loves, toward the end, ""What are we doing?"" it should break your heart, or make you panic. If you are the type to give this sort of thing any thought. I remember asking a bunch of friends over time, ten years ago, whether they thought much about death and dying--we were in our 30s and 40s, I guess--and the range of answers was amazing. Some a little, one a lot, and a couple people shook their heads and said, not at all. One was even a little amazed. Why would you do that? I laugh now at myself because the opposite is too easily true for me, and Hoffman's character likewise thinks of nothing else. Every little sign of change and decay in his body means he's soon going to be dead. And though that isn't literally true (he lives a little longer) it is of course true soon enough, for all of us. The point is, what do you do meanwhile?Or, for writer director Charles Kaufman, no matter what you do meanwhile, it won't be enough. It won't even be truly yours, but instead a series of reactions and accommodations. Kaufman has some kind of genius for finding the convolutions of reality, making them bend into surrealist existential problems, and keeping them funny and poignant and pertinent all the while. He wrote Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich, and this is his first role as director.And he knows about role-playing. An amazing movie. The word, synecdoche, is a technical (rhetorical) term meaning the linguistic substitution of a part for the whole, and it comes from Greek theater, or from the the study of Greek theater. A simple example is calling an assassin a ""hired gun."" Applied to this movie, besides the obvious substitution of an actor for a real person, it might imply all kinds of things about reducing what we are to what we can identify about ourselves, and about how we are just bits of the larger world. But we are, for ourselves, the defining bits. We are the world. It's all we have. And really, what are we doing?"
29,"Synecdoche, New York",10,5 December 2008,See this film!!!!!,"The most exciting aspect of Synecdoche, New York is that Charlie Kaufman is attempting greatness. The only real criticism you could level at this movie is that Kaufman tries to do too much. One should never fault a filmmaker for too much ambition. This is a first film by an untested director. For a freshman effort it is absolutely stunning in it's bravery and refusal to placate a mediocre, consumer audience. This movie is unabashedly an art film first and an entertainment second. You must meet the work halfway and join Kaufman on his spiraling, absurdist journey. In an era of artistic timidity this movie is like a cleansing breath of fresh air. Charlie Kaufman is not afraid to explore topics that most other filmmakers would rather not touch. I sense an almost Bunuel influence in Kaufman's obsession at pushing bodily decay in the audience's face. Make no mistake, this film is about mortality and the end of life. A light, date night at the movies this ain't! If you want to watch a true work of art that you can really engage with intellectually then you should definitely watch this picture. When Charlie Kaufman introduced the film at the Toronto Film Festival he described it as a conversation between himself and the viewer. That description is very apt. The piece has the exhilarating feel of a late night college bull session. It is a movie about everything and is not afraid to ponder the big questions while still employing a great deal of subversive and wry humor. If you like movies that take real chances than you should watch this picture. If you enjoyed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich, you will savor this film as Kaufman going for broke. This movie is like a cinematic Rorschach test. To really enjoy this film you must have a high tolerance for metaphor and symbolism. Kaufman constantly plays with the narrative to bring forth subtext. This is a movie that cannot even be deciphered in one viewing. There is an accumulation of detail in this movie that is staggering. I defy the most eagle-eyed viewer to catch all the important details the first time they view it. This film is such a rich construction and the constantly roving eye of the camera mirrors the anxiety of the protagonist as well as the anxiousness of the viewer as one tries to take it all in. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's minimalist performance as Caden Cotard will be unfairly derided in some circles as lazy. These unfortunate critics are not paying attention. Hoffman's character is so ground down by life that he barely has the energy to lift his head. His character is really just a fulcrum that other less neurotic characters spin around. The more Cotard tries to dramatize his life, the less sense it makes to him. Time ravages his body as he keeps trying to encapsulate the whole of his experience in a massive work of art. The whole movie is about an act of creation. Cotard's need to make sense of his life through art mirrors the audience's need to understand Kaufman's complex layers of symbolism. Kaufmann is doing the most important job of an artist. He is asking questions without providing the answers. It is left to the audience to figure out what, if any, grand statement is being made by the piece. When the movie ended, the strongest feeling I came away with was one of melancholy tempered by a certain sense of hope as well. Kaufman is a secret romantic and that ultimately is what I love about him. As bleak and full of despair as things become within the narrative, the movie is ultimately comforting. The main character finds solace in another character that was not previously important to him. The final truth is that there is no truth. The fact that we die is what gives life meaning. As you get older everything is taken from you. Life is simply a transitory process. However, that transitory quality gives it urgency and meaning. There is real resonance to be found in our connections with one another. I walked out of this picture in a sort of trance. It is one of the most important and exciting films to have been released this year. This is not a movie that you can like easily, but it is possibly a film that you will come to love. I know it is a film that I will watch many times in an attempt to catch all the small bits of nuance and detail. How wonderful and thrilling it is to discover a work of art that defies easy categorization. What you take from the piece may be entirely different from what I take from it. This fluidity of meaning is it's power and Kaufman's artistic triumph."
30,"Synecdoche, New York",1,10 August 2009,Auteur of 'Being John Malkovich' goes OTT,"A grossly overlong and indulgent playing-out of a conceit (Dict. an elaborate, fanciful metaphor, esp. of a strained or far-fetched nature) might be highly satisfying for a self-obsessed director and his fans, but for those outside the circle it looks megalomaniac and lost. Of course, there's a certain grandeur in ignoring the box-office dictates of Hollywood, and Charlie Kaufman is to be commended for it, particularly for raising the finance, which presumably comes from accountancy write-offs. Being John Malkovich was an outstandingly weird film that worked according to its own rules. It was also short, and focused. Synecdoche is neither, and the mega-project of the mad theatre-director hero sprawls out into the cinema, crushing hope and emptying seats. The lesson of this film is that awards can easily go to creative people's heads and cause them never to work again, which is the fate of Philip Seymour Hoffman's character, Caden Cotard. Sadly, obsession, grandiosity, megalomania and hypochondria are not attractive qualities unless punctured by wit and irony, and Synecdoche does not have such characters to put it into perspective, so the film is just as overblown and barmy as its hero's insane project. One spark of light in the parade of pretentious boredom was watching Samantha Morton stripping naked, until I realised it was Emily Watson, but hey, that's all part of the mixed-up trip in this gargantuan mess of a movie."
31,"Synecdoche, New York",9,25 December 2008,Indescribable like a dream.,"Synecdoche New York - Caden Cotard (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) thinks of  nothing but illness and death. He's a theater director who makes a life  sized version of New York and directs a play that consumes his life to.  He is determined to create a piece of brutal realism and honesty,  something into which he can pour his whole self, and so he gathers an  ensemble cast into an impossibly huge warehouse in Manhattan's theater  district. There are heavy themes of life, death, illness and illusion  and the blend between fantasy and reality. And the timeline condenses  and years go by in blinks, you'll find your head spinning. It is  directed and written by the king of impossible to describe films,  Charlie Kaufman.  The performances are top notch. Hoffman is in fine form as he gives the  literal performance of a lifetime. Cathrine Keener plays his  unsympathetic first wife. Samantha Morton plays his romantic interest.  All of the performances are stellar. I think my favorite parts are when  the ""real"" people begin to fall for the actor versions of their other  halves. It's all so ludicrous and yet so true. Kaufman really does have  a grasp of the hidden ""truth"" within illusion. He's just brilliant. I  loved Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind more than this but that  film was hopelessly romantic and more suited to yours truly.  I get the feeling that I'd need to see this film three or four times  through to get an accurate feel for it. Synecdoche has a quality that  is just indescribable. I was asked by other viewers afterwards what it  was about and I was lost for words. Talking about it is like describing  a painting. You just have to see it. It's like judging a man's life.  The closest thing I can think of that it comes close to is The Truman  Show. I could spend so long describing how I can't describe it. I  didn't strongly like or dislike this film. That's not the point. The  point of Synecdoche is to get one to think, and it succeeds in spades.  It's not emotionally gripping but surprisingly unsentimental. It deals  with the grimmest most widely shared problem (death) yet with wit and  reverence. Synecdoche combines the lack of glamour of reality with  dream-like moments and avant-garde qualities. In fact that's the best  descriptor I can give Synecdoche, it's a dream. It has an engaging  narrative, keeps things going, raises issues, but then you wake up and  go ""What was that?"" Quite unforgettable but hardly for everyone,  Synecdoche, New York gets an A-"
32,"Synecdoche, New York",9,12 March 2009,Touching and true and strange and compelling,"Like others writing about this film, I find it difficult to explain fully the ways I was affected by Kaufman's work. He showed us truth, without the boundaries of reality, by exposing what we are and how we live it, in a vision of real life unencumbered by the artifice of narrative linearity. Sort of.This is a tale of how life is, of what we are all doing in this ridiculous dance, of how shared the experience is, of how beautiful the pain is, of where we find ourselves at the end, which is also the middle and the beginning.Told through the disjunctive story of a theater director who thinks he's dying (but then he is, as we are all, no?) and out of ideas, the film goes on a bendy, twisty, story-in-story path -- similar in some ways to a David Lynch film, except here there IS easily gleanable meaning in the twists -- that lets us see an entire life, many entire lives as they interweave and affect each other.A short speech by a preacher at a funeral late in the movie sums up much of what the point is; I won't ruin it except to say that our lives can only be one thing, even though many opportunities present themselves, and it isn't worth sitting around and waiting.Most importantly, I was so deeply moved by this story... that I don't know what more to say. It makes me want to contact everyone I know and unburden myself to them, tell them how much I love them, etc. Which I won't do, because doing that after a moving film is like drunk-dialing an ex. But it will help me live more fully and honestly. It showed me something real, and goddamnit, that's art.It's not ordinary storytelling, but it's also not as much work as a Peter Greenaway -- so I recommend this to everyone, if they'll suspend their disbelief a little and leave their hearts open."
33,"Synecdoche, New York",10,15 November 2008,"We can dissect all we want, but in the end, it is a pleasure to have an artist like Kaufman in our generation.","It is only fitting that screenwriter Charlie Kaufman would step behind the camera for his directorial debut for this, which seems even more personal than ""Adaptation"". Philip Seymour Hoffman stars as Caden Cotard, a New York playwright who is known for his ambitious set-dressing technique. From the start of the film, it is obvious that Caden is quite obsessive compulsive when it comes to his work and his life. He begins to obsess about his health after a slight head injury.After Caden's production of ""Death Of a Salesmen"", a version where he chose young actors to portray the characters of old age and is congratulated on this choice (another Kaufman allusion to his own work in this very film), he is offered a genius grant. He vows to make his most personal work ever. By this time, his wife and his four-year old girl have taken a ""vacation"" in Germany. Quickly, we learn that as Caden is constantly going to doctors appointments and working on his play which begins to outright reflect reality, that it has been a year since his wife and child have left for Germany. Caden has lost all sense of time. Quick jumps take us only forward in time, and Caden does not seem to understand why.I would prefer at this point to not give too much of the plot details away, because this first act is very typical and humorous Charlie Kaufman writing. He slips in on the audience and gives them a reason to stay, to watch the film develop. Of course, he puts his own subtle ( and not so subtle) pieces of the plot in this first act. But for Kaufman's least accessible work, he has his plot down, he has his points, he has his humor, he has the knack for directing his actors.Everything comes together in a film such as this. As Caden begins to build a replica of his entire life within a warehouse in New York for his play, we see an amazing set come to life with a cast and crew who are obviously dedicated and who believe in the work of Kaufman. Visually, the film is beautiful, but not in the same way as ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"". It is just as, if not more surreal, than any of his previous work. It explores human relationships, the human mind, what life may mean to some people, it plays with gender roles, it's a play within a play within a film within a script within a life within a performance that is Philip Seymour Hoffman who is playing a man who is a reflection of the mind of Charlie Kaufman - and for what it is worth, it doesn't come off as a pretentious work whatsoever.If anything, Kaufman explores the neurosis of the human mind that he may know better than anyone. Having devoted this part of his life simply to writing, it has to be hard not to know your own brain inside out but to develop a parallel theory of paranoia to everything you are sure of in your mind. A human who is neurotic knows they are, unlike many humans who are paranoid schizophrenic who can be oblivious to the fact that they are paranoid, a neurotic human is aware of all times and is battling themselves in every moment of their life. Paranoia is a huge part of this film, but it is not the only aspect of it.The film possesses a jet-black humor to it. All of the jokes are truly funny. It is darker than any of the humor in all of Kaufman's other work, but it works so much better. The entire film works so much better. It is as if Kaufman knew that if he directed this project he could do it like he had visioned all of his other work on screen - but on the other hand, no one would expect this man to have so much confidence in himself, so I can see him doubting himself every second of making this movie. Once again, it is that constant battle. I think Kaufman knew he could make it the way he would want to see it, and that was good by his mind, but then, ""Will other people hate it? No one thinks like I do, I'm just crazy."" Even with that, we can see this film and we can over analyze it if we want and wonder why the artist put this in that or that in there and this person said that line or what does this mean. In the end, we can walk up to Kaufman and ask him, but I do not think he is that kind of artist. His work is open for interpretation. I think that how we reflect on this film, reflects on who we are. Our past experiences make us who we are today, and after we watch a film like this, a work of art, how we feel is a reflection of ourselves. Every response to this review is a reflection of our own personality, our human condition. Every event that has happened to us in the past has conditioned us to some degree to make us who we are today. Think about what you are about to say or do, and then think about who you are and what made you that.There is no need to go into and dissect every piece and every page in and every scene in Kaufman's work. It is a masterpiece to be enjoyed over and over. Every time we watch it in the future, we do not need to have a round table to wonder what everything means. Kaufman is reaching out and trying to convey his mind, his emotions, he is not trying to change his viewers. He is trying to relate, like everyone else."
34,"Synecdoche, New York",6,14 December 2008,Epic Kaufman,"This movie actually reminded me of the many Virginia Woolf books I read for a class a few years ago: a lot of beautiful and carefully considered words are said about life, but they end up getting second in line to the much more obsessive nature of the work and it's more interesting structure. I am sure, ""Synecdoche, New York"" has a lot to say, but I'm not totally sure what it is and find that it's not nearly as important to me as the process. I'm a fan of Charlie Kaufman's style of writing, and years and years of watching experimental, self-reflective, surreal, and wonky mind-twisting works have taught me to take these things at much more face value than others. The issue here is not trying to figure out what is going on, but letting it go where it's going to and being patient with it. Going into this movie, the real thing I was interested in seeing is whether this movie would have an audience of one or an audience of two: would only Charlie Kaufman like this movie, or could I like it too? Many people say that this movie really needed an editor to cut it down, but I'd hate to be the editor asked to do that. ""Well maybe we could get rid of this... wait a minute, was that important? Or maybe... no... well... wait, what about this? Oh wait..."" No, the editing isn't the issue, the issue is that this movie is a pretty miserable experience, and I don't mean that in a bad way because I'm pretty sure misery was what Kaufman was aiming for. This movie is, frankly, epic, and even more trapped inside the head than his other works. It follows the life of a man, Caden, from mid-aged crisis through death in old age, and structures it around all of the people in his life that slowly die or fade away as he gets increasingly removed from reality, trading in his hypochondria for a never-ending play set within a world within a world that endlessly seeks to recreate and re-interpret his feelings of loss and loneliness. However, it is important to note that it is also meant to be funny. You won't laugh aloud, but this movie is not Charlie Kaufman--it's more like a satire of the danger Kaufman sees in what would happen if his wish to invert the famous ""All the world's a stage"" quote were to be fulfilled. If what was on screen truly represented Kaufman's own reality, this movie wouldn't exist; and the only times the movie mentions ""truth"" is once the characters get trapped in a warehouse decidedly removed from the real world.What really lends this movie its cadence (please excuse the pun) is the really harsh and piercing way it abuses time. Caden slowly ages throughout the entire movie, a process turned tantalizing with the knowledge that the movie will end once he finally dies (and anyone who considers this a spoiler will understand how it's not within five minutes after the movie starts). And forced to wait for him to die, the audience gets to deal with the shocks as the people Caden love die before him, revealing a general (and understandable) fear not only of dying but of dying as the last one left alive. As a result, time jumps in sudden and unexpected ways, and Caden loses complete track of it (despite all of the close-ups of images of clocks throughout the movie). His wife leaves him for a month and suddenly has been gone for a year. His daughter grows to maturity before he's fully aware that she's gone. The Play goes 17 years and counting without ever letting out or gaining an audience. And through it all, Caden finds himself still stuck in the two-hour timespan of the movie itself, until he loses his role as director of millions and becomes the actor of one.And it drags. There's no denying that. Unfortunately, I can't really imagine the movie working any other way, so those who actually see it have to be patient with it. There's a lot of singular brilliant moments in the malaise, but it's a murky movie and not very willing to let anyone up for air. The best thing about, though, is that Phillip Seymour Hoffman takes what is the most demanding role ever asked for on film and manages to hold it together. The intensity of the acting and the hoops that man has to jump through to work through all the things the character work through pretty much demand that you watch it all the way through. Too bad very few people are going to end up seeing this one; it's very demanding of the audience as well, and even as a Kaufman film presents a whole new mode of film-making.In the end, this movie made me reconsider my impression of who Charlie Kaufman is as a person. I went into the movie with the assumption that it was about him the way ""Adaptation."" was about him, but whereas it was in some regards, in other ways its impossible that this movie could really represent him. Instead, Caden is, in fact, a post-modern Willy Loman, and one that needs a car-crash to end his suffering but never really gets it. And if your the type of viewer that needs a car-crash to keep a movie interesting, there's not a chance in Hell that you'll make it through this one.--PolarisDiB"
35,"Synecdoche, New York",,23 November 2010,Self indulgent piece made for the satisfaction of the film maker rather than the audience,"INITIAL IMPRESSION:This is the film that the Charlie Kaufman from Adaptation wanted to write.In Adaptation he tries to tell his agent, ""I don't want to cram in sex or guns or car chases, or characters you know, learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. I mean the book isn't like that, and life isn't like that. You know, it just isn't. And I feel very strongly about this."" In addition, about 40 minutes into Adaptation, Charlie Kaufman's character describes himself as self-indulgent, narcissistic, solipsistic and pathetic because he's written himself into his screenplay. It seems like Caden is just him again inside his own screenplay but unlike Adaptation this one has no change or drama or story and people do not succeed in the end.While in Adaptation Charlie Kaufman gave in to McKee and his twin brother Donald, it seems in Synecdoche he's decided to instead make a work of art his way, period. On principle I agree with this decision but feel he took it too far. There's a point at which you can overdo it.WHY I DIDN'T LIKE IT:At first, it's easy to get caught up in the puzzles embedded in Synecodche. Why is the house on fire? Who's writing in the girls' diary? What's the deal with the therapist? You might get the impression that beneath these puzzles, Kaufman is hiding some deep truth. Unfortunately, there's nothing there, and the puzzles are simply distractions.As Kaufman is committed to expressing his own point of view he is therefore unwilling to let the actors express theirs. Like Caden, Kaufman is off in his own head, obsessing over his thoughts without paying attention to the world outside. It seemed like one meaningless scene after meaningless scene. If that was the point then fine, but that is about as entertaining as a movie about the glory of watching paint dry.WHO MAY ENJOY IT:There was one theme that stuck out of the whole film that made me feel like this piece was made for the cynics and for those who agree with the sentiments of the main character. Perhaps because I do not fall into that category I did not form a bond with Synecdoche.Examples of this are when Caden is explaining his vision to the actors and says, ""What was once before you - an exciting, mysterious future - is now behind you. Lived; understood; disappointing. You realize you are not special. You have struggled into existence, and are now slipping silently out of it. This is everyone's experience. Every single one. The specifics hardly matter. Everyone's everyone."" The other was said by the wife to Caden, when under her breath she muttered something like, ""the more you get to know people the more disappointed you are""."
36,"Synecdoche, New York",1,19 April 2009,Probably the worst movie I've ever seen,"I really wanted to like this movie. I loved ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (it's one of my favorite movies of all time), and I've at least found Charlie Kaufman's other movies interesting, if not particularly moving. This one, though... wow. It's hard to know where to begin. This movie is so bad it makes me never want to watch another movie, or, alternatively, it makes me want to make a pile of my favorite movies and force myself to watch them for about a week straight to wash the stench of Synecdoche out of my mind. It's hard to even describe the ways in which this movie is bad, but maybe an analogy will do: it's like having a five-year-old child smear his feces all over your face for two hours, periodically interrupting the process to say ""Isn't this neat?"" with a big grin. There is nothing, literally nothing, to enjoy in this movie. Think about the ways that a movie can be bad. It can be horribly depressing for no particular reason and with no particular moral or worthwhile take-away message. It can be confusing, with a plot that is impossible to follow or make any kind of sense out of. Or it can be annoying, with lots of pseudo-clever gimmicks that don't work. Synecdoche manages to be all three kinds of bad all at once. The actors (all great talents) do what they can with the horrible material, but even they can't save it. I will spare you a plot summary, since it is very unlikely to shed any light on anything whatsoever. Suffice it to say that you probably won't know much more about what is going on in this film at the end than you did at the beginning, but you will be a lot more aggravated.Here's what I think the real point of this movie is: life is precious. Every minute is important. You must live life to the fullest, because one day we will all be dead. And given that this is the case, please do not waste two hours of your precious existence watching this train wreck of a movie. Instead, read a book, go out with friends, fall in love, play with children or animals, spend some time on your favorite hobby, go for a walk in the park. Do _anything_ but watch this movie. Life is too important.For my part, I will watch movies again. But I'm not sure that I'll ever subject myself to a Charlie Kaufman movie again."
37,"Synecdoche, New York",2,8 March 2009,depressing for no reason?,"I'd like to start by saying that I hate writing negative reviews. I try to only praise movies and let the ones that I consider to be terrible drift off on their own. But this movie...It's long, it feels longer than it is, and it goes nowhere. It presents this nihilistic, occasionally comical world populated with multiple versions of the same intentionally inconsistent but somewhat interesting characters. The film had some very good moments...I guess what I really have to complain about is that it never goes anywhere. It feels like nothing fits together and I can't get involved in any of the characters, including Caden because nothing that they do ever leads to anything. I know, I know that he was doomed from the beginning and that that's the focus of the movie, but I just can't care about any of the characters. It's emotionally draining and, with the utmost respect for all the brilliant and talented people that worked on the film, excruciating to watch. I can't possibly recommend this movie to anyone because it is such an emotional drain, and not in a good way.Yes, this review was a little disjointed and kind of flickers around a point without ever really catching fire, but that's intentional. I wrote the review in a way that I think reflects my feel of the movie, so pay attention to that."
38,"Synecdoche, New York",7,17 November 2008,"no conventional score applies to Synecdoche, New York","It is very difficult to conceive of a movie much more complex than synecdoche. Yet, oddly, I have no desire to see it again just so that I might resolve something. Not because I disliked it, but because so many scenes were indelibly imprinted within my mind such that I ""get it"". That is, I ""get it"" as much as can be expected. My first impression as the movie started was that ""dialogue"" was the entertainment. Actually, for this reason (i.e., dialogue), I would see this movie again. However, because the dialogue heightened my awareness of the same, it became easily perceptible when dialogue began to yield its place to various ""prop devices"" as the centerpiece of entertainment. I'm not necessarily using the phrase ""prop devices"" as disapproval because we sometimes present ourselves as silly when we, for example, indicate that such and such should not exist or should be replaced by such and such. In many cases, we would have then simply created ""another movie"". In this case, maybe we should make our own movie. That's when some of us would realize just how difficult it is to actually make one of these things. Some of the devices (literary or cinematographic) used by Kaufman were stunning or spectacular! For example, the ""voice"" of Adele's (Cotard's wife played by Catherine Keener) miniature paintings, and the paintings themselves, were used to great effect. The creation of a ""New York within New York"" presents very interesting and creative cinematography. The work (make-up, costume, and lighting) performed to create the illusion of aging characters is also very well done. And while the seemingly non-stop, nested twists and turns might make one dizzy, it is just this unexpected variety that provided a journey instead of just another movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman continues to deliver. I found his performance to be communicative and almost accessible to the touch, as one is almost unaware that he is acting. This gives us the feeling that we know him. We then become comfortable with him, and finally empathetic.This movie comes at you in layers of interwoven humanness. Every message invited the audience to think about themselves, their families, their lives, their legacy, their meaning, and their relationships. Caden Cotard (main character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) was chronically, and strangely ill. There was a scene where Cotard, after receiving permission from his wife Adele, urinated in a sink while his wife and young daughter were both present in the room (present, but not watching). His urine appeared to be mostly blood yet he offered no reaction at all and simply carried on as if the absurd had become the expected. His sickness seemed to symbolize the loneliness that is concomitant with the very individuality necessary in order to qualify as an autonomous human being. If we die alone, are we in fact alone? Of course, this movie is about much more than that. No doubt, most of the criticism of this movie will be that it is far too ambitious. But what do we want? Do we want movies that only fit within our conventional range of pace, dialogue, boundaries, and cinematography? It seems that conventional movies will continue to appear with great frequency so, they will be readily available, but movies like Synecdoche are rare. Nevertheless, there were quite a few things that I did not like. While Phillip Seymour Hoffman very convincingly depicted the kind of leg tremors that might be caused by neuropathy, I found his enactment of a seizure to be so unconvincing that I actually laughed aloud. Interestingly enough, there was a gentleman one row up and about 10 seats to my right, who clearly did not like my idea of ""funny"".  Although one got the strong impression that the gentleman expected everyone within 200 feet of him to ""synchronize"" with his idea of good comedic timing, as he outscored us all with his use of laughter aloud -- And that is one of the effects of the complexity of this film; that is, though this film might be easily regarded as ""despairing"", there were many funny moments where laughter erupted even while surrounded by loss and brokenness; just like real life. Sometimes, though, brilliance might not be brilliance; sometimes it just might be simple depravity disguised as something intellectual and modern. For example, while I love Tom Noonan's work in most everything he does, I did not like Kaufman's wording of his character's pitch to play Cotard.  Obviously, this ""play"" is not a real play, but a montage of a construct that represents the mind, fears, and philosophies of Cotard. While I would prefer dialogue that allows for the existence of things like intellectualism, the intelligentsia, modernity, and the avant-garde without requirement for homosexual references, don't mistake my preference for a suggestion that anything should be changed in this movie. Since Cotard was not homosexual, parts of the movie seem to suggest it par for the course that all men somehow contend with homosexuality. This is not true. This is the movie that Charlie Kaufman wanted to make. No one can say that it should be anything other than what it is. I doubt that any of us will agree on much regarding this movie, as we don't agree on much regarding life."
39,"Synecdoche, New York",6,14 December 2008,The New Charlie Kaufman: More Ambition and Less Joy,"""Synecdoche, New York"" feels like the work of a man gripped by fear, grief, and a sense that time is running out. The most ambitious of Charlie Kaufman's movies by a long shot, it is also the bleakest. Though Kaufman's work has always had a streak of comic miserablism running through it, his earlier movies are so creative and original that you feel invigorated by watching them. They're consistently delightful, and in the case of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" even profound.""Synecdoche, New York"" certainly aspires to profundity, but it's lost the sense of delight. It follows its protagonist, theater director Caden Cotard, for about forty years of ""one bad thing after another."" The only good thing that happens to him--he wins a MacArthur Genius Grant--turns out to be a curse in disguise, as he feels he must prove himself worthy of the grant, and spends the rest of his life conceiving and rehearsing a massive theater piece that never opens. Rather than engaging with life, he becomes lost in the world that he has created, building an exact replica of New York City inside a New York warehouse. The last part of the movie is a blur of deaths and funerals both real and re-enacted.Philip Seymour Hoffman, perhaps the best sad-sack actor working today, plays Caden. He gives a fearless performance, but he's maybe too passive in the role--not displaying enough of the mad-genius ambition that propels Caden to create such a huge work of art. Catherine Keener, who was so sparky and vibrant in ""Being John Malkovich"", plays Caden's first wife as a glum-faced shrew with awful hair.Brightening things up a bit is Samantha Morton, giving a very charming performance as the guileless box-office girl Hazel. And in a brilliant bit of doubling, Emily Watson plays the actress who plays Hazel in the play-within-the-movie. Hope Davis, in a small role as Caden's therapist, seems to have wandered in from another, less dour Kaufman movie--she'd fit in with the mad scientists of ""Eternal Sunshine."" For me, the scene that encapsulates ""Synecdoche, New York"" shows Caden working on his magnum opus late at night. He has hired thousands of actors and now needs to tell them what their roles are, so he writes short scenarios on pieces of paper and distributes them to his cast the next morning. As the camera pans over the slips of paper, which cover the floor of the warehouse as far as the eye can see, we note that every scenario is sad and depressing: ""You were raped last night."" ""You just lost your job."" Thousands of papers, and not a happy one in the bunch.If the movie took a skeptical attitude toward Caden's belief that only unhappy situations can make for great art, I probably wouldn't have a problem with it. But because the movie, instead, reinforces the idea that depression = genius and genius = depression, my entire belief system rebels against it. People have called ""Synecdoche, New York"" a profound commentary on the life of artists--but if being an artist was always like that, who would ever choose to become one? One could see parallels between Kaufman's life and his protagonist's: like Caden, Kaufman has won a coveted honor, and his first project after winning is deliberately big and ambitious. In my opinion, Kaufman richly deserved his Oscar for the ""Eternal Sunshine"" screenplay. But he won't deserve any more Oscars if he spends the rest of his life self-consciously trying to make Great Art, at the expense of the light and witty touch that is the reason we came to love him in the first place."
40,"Synecdoche, New York",1,25 May 2009,People were leaving the cinema!!!,"In all honesty, this is intellectual snobbery (or robbery). I loved Kaufman's previous scripts, I thought of him as extremely talented, but this film is just a disaster. Egocentric, pointless, boring... I hear people cried and laughed... Personally, I just yawned! In London, people were leaving the cinema, that's to say how captivating this film was (some were snoring too!). If this is Art with a capital A I'll be damned! This is self indulgence, and by a very successful writer that was allowed to do this so-called experimental movie thanks to previous credits. I cannot believe the reviews I read! Once more, we have an example of good cinema reviews versus bad product. Let's see how long it will stay on screen."
41,"Synecdoche, New York",3,24 November 2008,Get me out of this town!!!!!!,"Synecdoche, New York- * out of **** One of the more brilliant minds in Hollywood in terms of creativity is a man named Charlie Kaufman. All his films (""Being John Malkovich"", ""Adapatation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") tell their stories through creative and interesting ways. With 'Synecdoche, New York"" he goes behind the camera to direct his out there screenplay about a man who wants to make his mark on this world before he dies.I tried to love this film, but just couldn't get past how shallow and depressing it is. Kaufman, is known to be just like all this man characters: aloof, awkward, incredibly shy, but brilliant beyond all of that. Too bad the last characteristic didn't show up in this movie. I know what he was trying to accomplish and if he did, it would have been a treat. Instead, he fills the path to his message with so many metaphors that the film comes off as confusing to some and pretentious to others.Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a part of Caden. In the beginning of this film, Caden lives with his unloving wife Adele (Catherine Keener) in Synecdoche, New York. On top of him dying, his wife decides to leave him, taking their daughter and that is when his mission to do something big begins. Since he is a theater director, his plan is to use a huge grant he has just received to purchase a warehouse, and then build a life size replica of New York City. What is going to make this play different though is that it will tell the story of each person living in this pseudo city.Meanwhile, in the real world, Caden struggles with the women in his life: the beautiful but complicated actress Claire (Michelle Williams), his perky assistant Hazel (Samantha Morton), his therapist Madeline (Hope Davis), and Adele's evil sister Maria (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Kaufman definitely has a lot of his plate as for as story goes, but this guy can turn the most boring of situations into art. How does he fare? I believe that Kaufman with his other screenplays was asked to tone it down, because you can clearly see that he is all over the place here; trapped in his own metaphors and irony. There are too many shots that just seem artsy for the sake of being artsy. We never connect to Caden because he is such a cold and uncaring character, besides the point in the film where he sees what has become of his daughter from his first marriage.Then things get out of hand when within the replica of New York City, Caden gets actors to play him and Hazel. Some may find that brilliant or different, I just found it annoying because it was obvious how desperate the movie tries to be different. At least the actor who plays Caden (whose name escapes me) is a very likable character. Though he doesn't say much, you feel more connected to him and are saddened when he exits the film.I know a lot of people will say those who didn't like the movie didn't ""get it"" or appreciate it. For me, I knew what Kaufman was trying to do and say, but he did it in such a overly artistic way that it becomes annoying. There is a fine line between being different and purposely layering your film with laughable metaphors that is becomes snobbish.....you sir, Mr. Kaufman, leaped over that line."
42,"Synecdoche, New York",1,3 July 2010,Just Plain Bad,"I've seen a lot of films in my life and I can truthfully say that this is one of the ten worst, possibly the very worst. Kaufman has made a nice living over the years flying into his belly button. It's been an interesting ride but, with Synecdoche, New York, he has most assuredly jumped the shark.To say that this film was pretentious is an insult to pretentiousness. It is tone deaf, contrived, almost like something Kaufman would do as a gag to see how many people would take it seriously.And yet, this specious, horrid work of cinema does have one piece of real value. It shows that even gifted, capable, creative people can really screw up. To see this, like an amateur golfer seeing a PGA pro botch a shot, gives the rest of us hope. This is not schadenfreude, just a reminder that we aren't so bad after all."
43,"Synecdoche, New York",1,4 March 2009,A Pretentious Waste of Celluloid,"This was an appalling waste of celluloid. It was a forty minute concept, stretched out three times what it should have been. The first 40 minutes, all the points were made - the rest of the time, was nothing but tedium, and the awkwardness of watching generally good actors, shuffling around trying not to look embarrassed. Anyone who thinks this was a deep film, clearly has not seen much Cinema. While 'Being John Malkovich' was reasonably interesting for a while, and 'Spotless Mind' was much the same - a gimmicky concept stretched to yawn length - this particular piece of garbage said more about Kaufman's creative bankruptcy than anything to do with the human condition, or time, loss, or love. It was a colossal waste of everyone's time, naive, and intellectually flatulent. Clearly Kaufman wants to be - who knows? Bergman? Woody Allen? It doesn't matter, because he clearly doesn't have the talent to create conceptually breathtaking cinema stories. If you have never seen quality cinema, then you perhaps might think this is 'deep' - but the truth is, deep down, its utterly shallow. Yes there's some great performances here and there - but so what? Actors are only as good as their material. And this kind of klunky gauche film making, where a US film writer tries to make an 'avant garde' story - comes over as pretentious garbage. Avoid this like the plague, and save a couple of hours of your life."
44,"Synecdoche, New York",10,9 May 2009,Separate the infinity,"Everebody please excuse my English. I just came back form cinema with my mother. Do you think that mother is not the best partner to go with to the cinema? Yeah maybe you are right and maybe I did the best decision in my life. Kaufman explains absolutely nothing and completely everything, you just need to understand what he wanted to tell. After that movie my mum told that it was a stupid movie... I told her fine, I think, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I could not tell her that this is the masterpiece and my favourite movie of all times just to do not hurt her feelings. I do not know if i am able or if i want to explain my attitude to this movie. But Kaufman told us, that everybody has to live as wants, that everybody is his own something called god ( i am atheistic but i need to use this word) after about 100 minutes i realized that Kaufman sits in the cinema with me, and that he before the movie had told me how the movie would end. The last word of this movie for me was absolutely predictable, but i think that is the evidence of understanding. Who says that this movie is sad,depressive absolutely did not understand. please do not worry to write me any reaction I will be pleased. excuseme for my English again Your Michal"
45,"Synecdoche, New York",10,11 November 2008,Glorious despair,"First of all, do yourself a favor and consider not reading any further if you haven't seen this film; anything you know in advance is a spoiler.Now, having only seen it once myself, what follows are the initial thoughts and opinions I have of this confounding masterpiece. It is a challenging movie that demands multiple viewings to be fully understood and appreciated. The primary task at hand on first viewing is just to get through it, to experience all of it, and do your best to take it all in. It's bleak, slow, and brutally honest. It's about sickness, getting old, and dying. And it has some of the most unsexy sex scenes I've ever seen, so don't get too excited by the R rating for nudity with this one.Above all, this is a Charlie Kaufman story as only he could tell it and further affirmation that he is the most important screenwriter of our time. Fans of his past work are in for something vastly different but also comfortably familiar. The absurd humor hearkens back to the gags of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, and the analysis of the creative process functions as it does in ADAPTATION. I especially admire the way Jon Brion's melancholy piano score, reminiscent of his work in ETERNAL SUNSHINE, compliments the moods and tones of Kaufman stories.This is also Kaufman's directorial debut, but I still see him more as a writer than in the encompassing role of filmmaker. Making the move to directing his own script seems more a way of keeping his vision intact and an extension of his writing than the desire to be something more. The results of his new found control are uncompromised Kaufman and a trip deeper into his mind than we've ever gone before. Like his other work, he displays his unmatched ability to tap into the subconscious fears and desires of humanity with his characters. He creates something completely relatable and poignant to viewers, yet all the while existing in a surreal and abstract world.I finally saw Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA for the first time a few weeks before I saw this, and I had similar experiences watching them. Both are epic, dreamlike narratives of an aging man, but more than that was the feeling that what I was seeing was even more of an artistic achievement than I could fully comprehend at the time. In validation of these feelings, both of these films left lasting impressions in my mind, and as more and more time passes, continue to provoke new thought.Charlie Kaufman has produced his most ambitious and original work to date. It follows thematically and stylistically from his other scripts, yet relies less on cleverness and quirk and more on depth and complexity. As a hardworking writer with the insatiable need to challenge himself he is constantly re-imagining the possibilities of film with the goal of arriving at something more truthful to the experience of being human. His life, thoughts, and dreams are his inspiration and influence. SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK transcends the boundaries of cinema and is worthy of endless discussion and debate."
46,"Synecdoche, New York",1,15 November 2008,worst movie of all time,"Puerile, nihilistic, self-indulgent tripe...by the time the torture of this POS was over, I couldn't believe I'd paid for it.Kept waiting for some pay-off, any sliver of insight or meaning...none, just more 2-clever by 1/2 idiocy, the summa of which is the title, trust me, the title is more meaningful than the entirety of the whole ""film"".But wait, there's more! We get to see feces in a toilet, repeatedly, we get to see buxom women throw themselves at a pathetic nebish who cries when women want him...why do they want him? Who knows, it's never explained.Then there's the ooh-so-deep, bong hits in the dorm vision of how everyone is a player on the stage, and we're all just actors. ""All the world's a stage, etc."" Shakespeare said it in one line, this movie takes 2+ hours to labor over the idea and add nothing.Wow, totally craptastic!"
47,"Synecdoche, New York",10,27 March 2017,One of the Most Deeply Haunting Films I Have Ever Seen,"Synecdoche, New York is one of those films that you'll never see anything like for the rest of you're lifetime. Its a haunting, sad and painful story about life and death, the meaning of each of you're choices and many more themes. It's a movie that you're going to have to see 2 or 3 times to fully get a grasp of it's scope, beauty and ambition. Synecdoche, New York's purpose is to show us the raw truth and it never shies away from it taking you to places you've never been before. Although it is not a film that you should watch when you're sad because Synecdoche is probably the saddest and most depressing film I have ever seen it rips you're heart out and makes you swallow it.Charlie Kaufman shows that he is one of the greatest screenwriters of all time delivering maybe his greatest script. There are so many subtle details and subjects in this film that you will probably not see in the first and second viewing. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Caden and gives one of his greatest and most profound performances he has ever given. Kaufman takes us on an emotional rollercoasters taking you from tears to laughs. It's a hard to watch film and the themes stuck with me for months and whenever I watch it I end up always being sad and effected by It's power. The film has one of the most beautiful and heart wrenching soundtracks I have ever heard with some absolutely beautiful scores and songs.Be prepared for the tough content and be very emotional prepared cause as I said it's the saddest film I have ever seen. Although Synecdoche, New York is a film that not everyone will enjoy it is for a certain taste. It is a film that very much spoke to me and connected to me Kaufman's way of building this bizarre world is genius. The themes are profound and some of them are very subtly put there so make sure you get them. This is an absolute gem of a film It is one of the most ambitious films I have ever seen. Kaufman shows off how much of a genius and beautiful storyteller he is with this haunting affecting film which is one of my favourites of all time. 10/10"
48,"Synecdoche, New York",10,24 August 2016,What it feels like to want to make an impact before you die,"Synecdoche, New York is the most complex movie I have ever watched. However, you can still watch and enjoy it for the surface level themes it presents. Which is why many people love this movie, there is no universal interpretation. I saw it as wanting to make an impact on the earth before you leave it forever in death. Quite morbid, which the whole movie is.The script is Charlie Kaufman so of course the whole thing flows beautiful, nothing over stayed it's welcome and it moves in a way that is relevant to one of the themes of the movie which is time.Phillip Seymour Hoffman is Brilliant as always, you get to see this man life and I feel like coming out of the movie, you feel like you've lived a life. You reflect on death and your own life as well. The movie lends itself for self-reflection. Which Charlie Kaufman loves to make us do.Overall, a mind bending movie which I can recommend to people who don't get annoyed when events aren't literal."
49,"Synecdoche, New York",9,12 October 2015,"I've watched you forever, Caden, but you've never really looked at anyone other than yourself.","Sammy has been following Caden Cotard for 20 years of his life, obsessing over every little detail until he can nail down pat the theatre director in his performance. He flits in and out of the initial narrative; blurred in shallow focus, quickly cut away embracing a young Olive, creeping behind red curtains in the dead of night. He is hired immediately and begins his input onto this magnum opus of a project. But things unravel, as they always do in a story about a tortured artist. Sammy begins to date outside the lines of reality and the project. This isn't how it happened. Hazel's actress is British, but she maintains her artistic integrity on set. The simulation is shattered as Sammy tearfully commits suicide. What does Caden shout in futility? I didn't jump! He complains, but of course, didn't he try to do so earlier when confronted with Hazel's new family and life? The compartments of his New York are breaking free. The meaningful order of his stage is comprised. Time is the villain. In that kitchen, sly editing reveals time passing within seconds, but on initial viewing we are like Caden, unable to comprehend this. A series of scenes jumps months to a dental surgery. Has it been a week, or a year, Hazel implores? Is Olive 4, or 11? Caden's physical ailments worsen; seizures, lesions, uncontrollable body parts. Seymour Hoffman is not just a tortured artist in his mind, but physically decaying. Each wheeze, exhausted sigh and ginger step are drenched in melancholy and regret. He requires eye-drops just to cry. This is a great performance, aided by fantastic make-up artistry. Jump back to the first of his obsessions, which turns Adele's studio, a palette of grimy browns and mouldy fish tanky greens into a spotless basement. All with a toothbrush. How long has Caden spent agonising, cleaning and cleaning and cleaning? We see the roots of Ellen here. He mirrors his peers in his own heartbreaking demeanour. Adele's mind is light, carefree, ambitious - she coughs heavily in each scene and this is even continued in Caden's own projections of the future; Keener's wonderfully mundane monologue which turns bleak through the nihilistic lens of Caden and the final fate of lung cancer. But she doesn't dwell on it. Hazel is the same. She inquires about a eternally burning house that will frame her final moment of life, but although nervous, makes a big decision and is able to settle down (for a while at least). No one thinks about the place they will die in when buying their first home. No one except Caden. This is a disturbing and fascinating project, because Caden is swallowed by the inaccuracies of it. He tries to reconstruct life, compartmentalise it, slipping summaries on little notes to the actors, and in doing so only increases its scale. Adele's work grows smaller. The camera blurs the boundaries between reality and simulation; is this a multi-cam setup? Are there walls to the flip-side of this apartment? Shots are mirrored; we turn a corner to reveal the gigantic warehouse setting, and do it again and again. In-world and out critics might call this venture pretentious - I disagree. Maybe that label can be stuck to Caden's usage of youthful actors to play the old, a technique that is never quite explained. Beneath this monolithic New York is genuine emotional ache and suffering, an increasing desperation and spiraling loss of control. He finds romance only in those who are suffering; would Claire be so inclined to f*ck him if she hadn't just been to her mother's funeral? This flaw isn't reconciled until that final peaceful moment amongst the fire with Hazel. He then relinquishes control and finds solace and human connection on the shoulder of a stranger. He knows only now the key to the puzzle of life's futility, after he has spent a lifetime of living trying to decipher it. Goffman's theory of the presentation of the self is relevant here. We morph for different people and settings, to make an impression. The audience laughs, or cheers, or claps, or boos, and we alter our performance to see fit. If lucky, a select few allow us into that backstage area. But of course, it's all a little more complicated than this. Caden tries to simplify it because he is withering, and fast. Why inquire into the reasons his marriages break down? We shall simulate it instead and find out. Synecdoche, New York is an immense film to sit through. There are layers upon layers, details so intricate that repeated viewings are imperative. Some hold crucial meaning, some are to be overlooked. There are some tangents that seem on-the-nose, some jokes that flirt with the ideas of dark humour and some that are just plain ridiculous. In time I could probably indicate extraneous sections that ought to have been cut during editing. Oh, but you could say it's about life and the delusions of an artist, and that is always a messy affair. I'm not sure. I shall watch it again."
50,"Synecdoche, New York",9,31 May 2015,Bizarrely Powerful With A Deeply Moving Supporting Performance,"This is truly an extraordinary film and one of the most imaginative films from a visionary director. Darkly humorous and extremely disturbing, this is a movie that people discuss for years after its first release. Certainly, the meaning of many aspects is not exactly clear and open to interpretation. It wallops one with its existentialist power and descriptive imagery of humanity's innate loneliness. The performances are uniformly excellent but it is Emily Watson who stands out and leaves the strongest impression. There is one scene in particular where she casually stands completely naked and talks to Hoffman about how f---ing seems to sometimes help the loneliness. It is an astoundingly powerful piece of film that is made even more intense by the courage Watson shows in playing it. She is a lovely woman but no longer a quite young one, yet she is unashamed of being a real flesh and blood woman. And she is indeed that. Hauntingly beautiful as real women are, sensual, and yet achingly vulnerable in her brokenness. However, it isn't just her body that's bare, it's her very being, in fact her soul. Breathtaking acting. There is something so profoundly moving, so true, and deeply sad about her and so magnetic in her performance that it is simply unforgettable. The film is worth seeing if for her stunning work alone."
51,"Synecdoche, New York",10,5 November 2014,A perfect masterpiece,"This is a movie that you can watch hundreds of times and still find new subtle meanings and ways to appreciate it. Charlie Kaufman is a genius at what he does and deserved an Academy Awards for this incredibly complex and groundbreaking masterpiece. It is a near or even a perfect movie.The film is complex and should be watched twice. The reason why this should be watched twice is because there are endless details in the movie that are hard to notice the first time you watch it. The film is brutally honest and serves as a great example of a flawless piece of cinema. Moreover, the performances from this incredible cast are as amazing as the movie. Late Philip Seymour Hoffman gave his best performance."
52,"Synecdoche, New York",10,7 September 2014,"Indeed it is exhilarating, but above all it is mind boggling and seriously genius.","Indeed it is exhilarating, but above all it is mind boggling and seriously genius.I am lucky to have seen Charlie Kaufman films. And I love this film as I did many of his other films too. Mind you this film may well boggle the mind literally.Kaufman's earlier films were all about mind and this one is no different in that aspect. Yet, he merely wrote his earlier films but he took the mantle of direction with this one. Thus, this film is much more tough to decipher or even blatantly comprehend. There is lot of symbolism involved as I started to learn more about the film I realize more of it. Example is that the name of the protagonist is Caden Cotard and he feels as if he were dead already and life is a dream. There is in actuality a Cotard delusion. There are many more things that I keep learning as I see this many more times. This is precisely my 5th time I saw and each time I see this there are surprises. Everything is more complicated than I thought. This makes the film interesting and also open for interpretation. Kaufman stands to his quality of writing great films and this stands right up along with his finest works. Acting by Philip Seymour Hoffman is great. He plays Caden Cotard with a comfort and clarity as if he has understood all the complications of the character. This is a great testimony of the capacity and capability if this fine actor and I wish that gets the appreciation he deserves. Catherine Keener does a fine job and is so understated. The performances are very poised in this superlative film. I am still not confident whether I did comprehend the film in the right way or even if there is one way to interpret or not. I can only say this much they I loved this film and will continue to do so. This is a 5/5 for one of the most challenging films ever made. It takes gut and lot of thought to pen it down. Thanks to producers for backing this worthy endeavor. Thanks to Charlie Kaufman above all else."
53,"Synecdoche, New York",10,20 July 2014,Amazing,"Movies have a way of touching people in such a profound way it's almost like they actually happened. Of course, in the case of this film, the story never happened nor will it probably ever happen. But that doesn't really matter. Charlie Kaufman knows exactly how to write a perfect blend of fantasy and reality. He has done it many times before with huge success. Now he's directing with this film and it's extremely well made. Despite the film having a very strange fantasy depth to it (creating a play within a play in a huge scale model of new york), it still doesn't derive from the incredibly real characters we're presented to. You can feel the anguish, pain, loneliness, and love within every scene that the late Philip Seymour Hoffman performs in. Basically every actor and actress in this film is extremely suitable and do a fantastic job. You could almost say this to be an almost story within a story. The whole section where Caden is trying to create art is almost sunk in into the part where Caden is trying to control his relationships. All in all, this film is beautiful. Well written, well directed, well acted, great score, emotional, powerful, and depressing. I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone however. It's for sure different than most movies out there. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't create the same movie magic and incredible stories that Charlie Kaufman has given us for years."
54,"Synecdoche, New York",10,18 June 2014,Philip Seymour Hoffman. An Immortal Actor.,"Philip Seymour Hoffman. An actor par-excellence, who tragically passed away four months back at the age of 46, had a career of only ups, in my opinion. Be it a cameo, a supporting part, or even being a leading-man, Hoffman never failed to astonish us, with his sheer brilliance as an actor. And in 'Synecdoche, New York', Hoffman delivers a tour-de-force performance as a man in search of life. Hoffman dominates the show with a sterling act!'Synecdoche, New York' Synopsis: A theatre director struggles with his work, and the women in his life, as he creates a life-size replica of New York City inside a warehouse as part of his new play.'Synecdoche, New York', written & directed by the magnificent Charlie Kaufman, is tale of life. It has everything. Happiness. Sadness. Struggle. Love. Hate. Jealously. Loss. Death. The protagonist, Caden Cotard, played by Hoffman, experiences every emotion a human-being goes through. Its eventually a tragic story of a man's struggle of dealing with life, but the impact it leaves on its viewer, is tremendous. Kaufman''s Screenplay is saddening, but moving & memorable, as well. Kaufman's Direction, on the other-hand, is simplistic. Cinematography is excellent. Editing is just right. Art Design is fabulous. Make-Up is perfect.Besides Hoffman, its Samantha Morton, who stands out with a terrific performance. Her scenes with Hoffman, are simply brilliant.On the whole, 'Synecdoche, New York' is an effort that cannot be missed! And for Hoffman, Rest In Peace. You Will Always Be Missed!"
55,"Synecdoche, New York",10,20 December 2012,Profoundly confronting,"Synechdoche New York portrays life as experienced by a man in modern individualistic society. Born into mystery and finding no sense of destiny or explicitly evident meaning. The protagonist -an artist- must create his own meaning, his own statement of significance. Time races on as he struggles alone to get to grips with what is happening around him. As he tries to exert control over his circumstances he finds that he increasingly loses control and becomes ever more entrenched in confusion. The consequences of his actions spiral out of our control and he becomes helplessly alienated; caught in the raging white water of relentless accelerating change. As the film progresses, the context of scenes is ambiguous and the chronological progression is baffling, as great swathes of time pass implicitly. This is an ingenious devise to evoke the relentless sense of time slipping away that the protagonist struggles with. By the time the protagonist reaches old age the world has become a more terrifying and confusing place than ever.I found the film intensely emotionally gripping, as so many of the things that all of us fear most and battle with in our lives play out before us in artfully crafted metaphor and achingly raw pathos. Though often comical, this is not a film for the faint of heart, as a mirror is held to us and we are forced to stare into the abyss. Both the casting and the performance of the cast are exceptional in this challenging film. Among Kaufman's work, for me this is undoubtedly his masterpiece. It profoundly resonated with me and I will forever recall how it made me feel. A superb piece of cinema."
56,"Synecdoche, New York",10,3 December 2012,Brilliant and subtle critique of the myth of the self,"This film reminded me of Inland Empire in its incredibly ambitious attempt to present an allegory for the very way people experience life. People often praise Holy Mountain for its all-encompassing attempt to provide a life guide but when placed alongside Synecdoche and Inland it seems about as valuable as the liner notes from a Propagandhi album.In just over two hours Synecdoche does a pretty damn thorough job demystifying the dramas we've been taught to live our lives by and the fictitious notion of the sanctity of the self.The Olive character (his daughter) is a brilliant example of the latter. At the start of the film she is played by a ridiculously cute actress and we see her as a precocious 6 year old. In a sudden turn of events she is taken to Germany by her mother and the next time Philip Seymour Hoffman sees her it is behind a pane of soundproof glass and she is in her twenties, covered in tattoos and dancing nude. The next time he is actually able to speak to her she is in her late 30s, on her deathbed and doesn't even speak English (due to growing up in Germany). It's a brilliant argument against the ""I'm a beautiful and unique snowflake"" argument people hold so dear when thinking of their personality/self. The viewer is obviously incredibly disconcerted by the notion that the filmmaker wants us to believe that the sweet little girl at the start of the film is the same person as this bloated, tattooed, surly German woman. The meaning behind this being that it is not the same person and simply because that individual is still his daughter (biologically) and still has the same name does not mean it's the little girl he knew decades ago.Synecdoche offers the viewer answers unlike Inland Empire which is INCREDIBLY nebulous and really only has answers for individuals both familiar with Lynch's semiotics and with the analytical skills to extrapolate meaning through the application of existentialist/absurdist frameworks. There is a monologue which is delivered by an actor playing a priest (a character of virtually no importance in the film which is very fitting conceptually) that appears towards the end of the film which does a miraculously good job telling the viewer what they've been shown. Actually reminded me a lot of Ondatjee's ""Coming Through Slaughter"" and the whole ""futility of creating signposts in life"" idea.One big difference between Synecdoche and Inland is the ending. Perhaps due to Synecdoche's more overt attempts to provide explanations and answers its ending comes across as being somewhat sad. I can see this being particularly true for people who didn't really grasp or didn't really agree with Kaufman's argument. I find Inland Empire's ending to be incredibly joyous with its metafictional catharsis (two characters from unrelated stories and times inexplicably meeting, embracing and crying in each other's arms). Interestingly enough Synecdoche ends in almost an identical fashion. Hoffman is in the arms of an actor who plays the mother of the character he is currently playing in his own play and he is expressing regret for not fulfilling the promise that character made to her mother. In both instances the characters transcend their roles and unquestionably embody that which the filmmaker has been working towards throughout the film."
57,"Synecdoche, New York",7,18 July 2012,Well...,"To be completely honest, I didn't liked very much this movie aft first.In my opinion, the first part of the movie is incredibly tedious and almost unwatchable (And I could understand perfectly well why so many viewers found this film to be pretentious and boring) I guess that all what happened at the beginning was a necessary introduction of the characters and the story before the things start getting weird, but personally, I could hardly tolerate that part of the movie. It is when the whole deal about the play which imitates the life of the main character begins, I started to find this film interesting. It is from this point than the story turns much more complicated (With many parallels between the fiction and the reality and surreal situations) at the same time; I consider this to be the most fascinating part of the movie, with a very interesting use of symbols and motifs, until a perfectly satisfying conclusion, which fits perfectly with the overall tone of the whole film. The direction style of Charlie Kaufman in this movie is pretty solid, keeping a good level of ambiguity between the reality and the inner world of the protagonist; however, I think that what makes this movie work so well is the excellent performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman, which disregard of the fact that I found his character to be someone likable or not, he made it believable and realistic, with all the virtues and (many) flaws that could define someone as a person. In many ways, I admire Synecdoche, New York as a daring cinematic experiment (such as ""My Winnipeg"" or ""Inland Empire"") though it is very easy to see why the opinions about it tend to be polarizing. But that's precisely the point of making films like this, in order to create something different and unique that could be either loved or hated. My final impression is more in the positive side, but I do admit that this isn't exactly something very easy to watch or enjoy."
58,"Synecdoche, New York",7,28 December 2009,I want my mind back!!! Good movie,"I really wanted to give this movie a higher rating than 7 out of 10, I really did, a movie that was so sublimely filmed, so wonderfully scripted, so delightfully acted! It really deserved an 8-9/10. You really got to know which characters to hate, which characters to love, and which characters to feel sorry for... But the movie was just far too long. It dragged on too much and just got too surreal, and confusing. BUt that is actually what i really enjoyed about the movie, it made you think. It was more about symbolism than what you see on the scree, and this is why I really wish i could find a reason to mark it higher than a 7"
59,"Synecdoche, New York",1,28 May 2009,Kaufman presents a dead bird,"Charlie Kaufman can't tell jokes. Well, so what, you might say; according to some, nor could Shakespeare, and what of that? But then, Shakespeare never wrote a play consisting of nothing but jokes.Of course, Kaufman the writer has been badly let down by Kaufman the director (although no more or less badly than he was let down by Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry, than whom he is at least no less talented)  so it's hard to say where exactly the fault lies; but while watching this film one comes to the slow and dazed realisation that what it's attempting is humour.For example: Caden (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is raging about his daughter's getting a tattoo at an early age. Claire (Michelle Williams) takes off her shirt to reveal that her back is entirely covered by a bright red tattoo of Satan, which she says she got at the same age. Caden, who has been sleeping with Claire for several years: ""Well, I've never seen THAT before."" It's a joke right out of ""The Simpsons""; one can imagine Homer Simpson delivering the same line. The difference is that in ""The Simpsons"" the line would have been funny, and we wouldn't have blinked, sat in puzzlement through whatever happened next (one ceases to care after a while) and perhaps even made it through the closing credits and out into the street before realising that this line was supposed to be funny. Kaufman presents jokes to us the way a cat might present a dead bird, then stalks off to bask in his own cleverness while we're struggling to work out what our reaction is meant to be.Not one of Kaufman's jokes, conceits, or visual touches, not the one-liner about the tattoo, not the unexplained Zeppelin that weaves its way through the scale-model New York tenements, not the miniature portraits you need magnifying glasses to see, not the laboured basic premise of the film, has any impact or life. Anyone can come up with these ideas: philosophy postgrad students are already able to generate thought experiments of this kind by the dozen, and often tell them better. And, alas, the film is like conceptual art. Once I tell you what it's about you might as well not bother to watch it. You've already got the gag. And it's not funny."
60,"Synecdoche, New York",,30 May 2009,I don't understand this film at all,"This film is about a play director who creates an alternate New York in a huge theatre.I probably will never understand why ""Synecdoche, New York"" have such raving reviews and positive comments. To me, ""Synecdoche, New York"" is pointless, confusing and boring. It is overlong and slow, and I had to get up from my seat and exercise in order to stop myself falling asleep. So was Cotard living a dream, or directing a play, or is he delusional? I just do not understand this mess.Maybe the film is full of metaphors or messages, but I did not get a single thing. It surely goes down as one of the most time wasting film I have ever watched."
61,"Synecdoche, New York",4,30 May 2010,Kauffman. Where did you go wrong?,"I have been a huge fan of Charlie Kauffman's work for a long time. Each adventure into his mind has brought forth great wonder and great introspection for me. In Being John Malkovich, he delved into the idea of the human soul. In Adaptation he showed how impossible it is to have originality in your creative endeavours and how life is more outrageous than movie. In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind he let us face how we remain deeply entangled with those who have had so strong an affect on us that we wish it away. And whether or not that is the right thing to do.Which brings us to Synechdoche, New York.There are lessons to be learned throughout the film. Life, death, the roles we play to each other and the lies we tell ourselves. However, these lessons are not trickled in our ear, they are smashed into our brains with a heavy mallet. There is little to no joy in this escapade, no magic or happiness. I understand Hoffman's character is a man who does not feel these emotions but no one else does. The film spits bile at the idea of love being anything more than life's cruelest joke. Kauffman's on screen visions have hardly been cheery watching but they have still been injected with something otherworldly which sometimes filled your heart with warmth. Synechdoche New York does not.I feel this was mainly down to one thing. Charlie Kauffman should stick to writing. It is what he excels at. How a man could turn a film about staging a play of your own life ad infinitum within a giant warehouse into maudlin, pretentious navel gazing is beyond me. The narrative is over-burdened with stories that go nowhere and have no point existing. Kauffman doesn't seem to realise what a great central premise he has and that he should stick to it. His wandering becomes aimless and tiresome well before the halfway mark. This only makes the moments of genius within (of which there are) all the more painful as you feel you should have earned them far before they are given.I feel disappointed beyond reason. What could have blown me away has merely left me feeling cold. I hope the next time I see a Kauffman script on the screen this is not the case, since like I said, I am a fan of his work."
62,"Synecdoche, New York",10,24 October 2008,Absolutely brilliant. A masterpiece.,"Synecdoche, New York is one of those rare movies that make you re-evaluate your life and that can change the way you see the world.The script is sincere, heartfelt and brutal in its uncompromising preoccupation with the most painful elements of our existence. Having said that, the movie is far from depressing and is in fact hilarious. The humor is balanced out by moments of what I can only describe as pure cinematic poetry, the likes of which I haven't seen since, well, since Kaufman's previous film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.The cast is unbelievable; there are so many great actors in this movie, and they all do an incredible job. Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers what in my opinion is the best performance in his career (excluding Capote which I haven't seen and cannot comment on). Samantha Morton and Michelle Williams also stand out among this remarkable ensemble. And Sadie Goldstein, who plays Hoffman's four-year-old daughter, is just so adorable!The score is also phenomenal, and the end credits song was so beautiful it broke my heart.All in all, this movie has had a huge emotional impact on me and is definitely the kind of movie you have to see more than once. I give it my highest possible recommendation."
63,"Synecdoche, New York",9,30 December 2008,"Wry masterwork of the human condition echoes Beckett, Buddhism, other","Roger Ebert felt this strange, darkly humorous, philosophical film justified his departing from conventional review format; i.e., not bothering with synopsizing the plot, naming the characters and who played them, etc.in other words, writing a review like the ones we've been doing here for years. ""Synecdoche"" is Oscar-winning screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut, and the film he's written and directed here is a masterpiece. The odd title incorporates a Greek literary term that means one thing standing, in a turn of phrase, for many; and, as well, a group of like things representing, generically, one. But it's also meant to evoke Schenectady, N.Y., where the action begins with theater director Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman) staging a somewhat chancy, innovative production of Arthur Miller's great ""Death of a Salesman."" (In which, tellingly, Willie Loman as a tragic figure represents a mopey ""everyman,"" while in classical Greek tragedy and its Aristotelian theory, tragic embroilment was supposed to be a monopoly of royalty and the gods. Thus even here, synecdoche is invoked.) Plot: Loosely, a freak plumbing accident leads to medical visits that gradually reveal Caden to be dying ... perhaps ... and of what? ""Can't tell."" He also happens to receive a MacArthur Genius Grant, so, in the wake of his abandonment by his wife Adele (Catherine Keener) with their daughter, Olive, he sets off to do something great, large, monumental with the money. He leases cavernous warehouse space in New York City and sets out to stage his life. Here's where the film really takes off and its thematic vessels start to fruitfully overflow. It seems Caden's fatal disease(s) allow him to live to ripe old age after all, as he outlives his parents and, eventually surveys a life in life and art. Actors are chosen (or successfully nominate themselves) to play himself and his associatesloves, lost loves, their other loves, etc. The one who confidently puts himself forward to play Caden was, if you were paying attention, hovering around at the margins of the scenes earlier in the film. Was he supposed to represent Death? Or, rather, the constantly monitoring consciousnessuniquely human self-consciousness, the inner ""double,"" that isthat raises the question of how authentic we are (""playing ourselves,"" second-guessing, correcting, affecting, posturing, even as we live ourselves)just as Caden keeps chastising one actor to find the medium between how he naturally wants to do something and an overreaction to Caden's direction of how he wants him to do something. The film gets a little preachy, and is certainly didactic, toward the end, when, among other things, Caden points out that one moral is, everyone is the lead in their own ""play,"" the center of their own subjective world, and so no one should be slighted. There is also kind of a counter-existentialist statement of the unknowability of the connections, ""strings,"" our choices have to millions of other events (""events"" rather than ""outcomes,"" because we often can't even trace the causation, if any, and certainly can't predict it). But, in thwarting an attempted suicide in the course of the action, Kaufman veers away from a despondent nihilism with the notion that this life, infinitesimal and tragically sad as it often is, is all we have. Caution: In case you haven't already realized, be careful not to take anything in the film too literally, as Caden's diseases appear to turn out to be a metaphor for universal mortality (not mention the plagues and minor annoyances of organic, physical existence): we're all dying, of course, even as we can never truly, actionably comprehend and believe it. As I watched the film, I wondered how other, younger members of the audience could truly identify with it, with its depiction of the accumulations of losses and disappointments throughout lifeones that I have experienced, such as an adult daughter blaming me for an estrangement engineered by others; the regrets and recriminations that arise from love, possibly true love, tried, trifled with and lost. (Samantha Morton, here at her most beautiful since playing the Earl of Rochester's protegé in the Johnny Depp vehicle ""The Libertine"" reminds us of one of our such wistful, unrequited loves, with her big boobs and disarmingly teasy flirting.) Adele's ridiculously miniaturist paintings offer another symbol of the tininess of our lives and, often, the smallness of our ambitions, cruel pettiness of our actions. Yet from within one of her images comes another synecdoche, of the common humanness of the genders, in spite of their nearly completely alienating, hostility-breeding differences, so that, Tao-like, each contains the seed of the Other, as Caden and Ellen Bascomb/Millicent Weems (Dianne Wiest) metamorphose into one another at the end. One who lost a daughter; one who never had the one once dreamed of. (Robin Weigert, ""Deadwood's"" Calamity Jane, is almost unrecognizable here as Caden's daughter Olive, as an adult and a German, dying of blood poisoning from her full-body tattoo ... serving as a nice stand-in for a hostile fantasy in which my adult daughter could die as a result of her grotesquely large gauge ear hoopsperhaps a friend casting a line on a charter fishing expedition might accidentally hook one and fling her out to sea. Or, wearing her old, weightier, lead-imbued, Chinese-made Goth ear studs, her sense of balance might be altered and she could teeter off the curb into the path of a Greyhound bus.) Anyway, this is a film almost religious in its a-religiousness, its ultimate humanism. It is as if the best of Bergman and Woody Allen (and a soupçon of Alain Resnais, ""Mon Oncle D'Amerique"") rolled into one, chopped up, and arranged through the profound, kaleidoscopic expository genius unique to Kaufman, akin to the involuted forms of his ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Adaptation."" See it."
64,"Synecdoche, New York",,10 December 2008,Death of a Playwright,"I'm thrilled by this film: all the wonderful narrative devices that I find delicious and engaging, and this time turned to have an effect on the viewer that is not to be lost lightly. He's wonderful.But I'm amazed at the writers who seem to have missed the significant structural arc. Without this shape, it is merely a tragedy with an interesting, introspective dialog, annotated by enabled poetic images (like the daughter's death from sick tattoos). Without this shape, its not unlike a ""Love Liza"" mapped into ""State and Main,"" which was a rather easy to read mapping of the ""state"" of the play into the main of life. Without this shape, you loses all the hope, all the rooting in life. You lose, I believe, everything that makes this uniquely useful as a scaffold for a whole new imagination. Without this one thing, you loose the layering all the way down into the soul of the writer, because the layering stops at the screen.The thing I am talking about is ""Death of a Salesman.""If you were Kaufman, indeed any American screenwriter today, one of your touchstones has to be this play. Its important because it opens a new dimension on the internal dialog made visible outside the page. It introduces us to a whole new vocabulary of writing by a writer imposed on an ordinary life in such a way that the writer's life is visible, surfing on the ordinary waves of waking and sleeping.We are presented with a director, Hoffman, staging an unusual ""Death of a Salesman."" He inserts himself in the thing, and the thing (and his body) become the (I should emphasize the singular) synecdoche of the world. Its a matter of his life and entire world being written and directed by himself, constrained by the shape of Lohman. If you step through the play, and layer folded imagination on it (with presumably more skill on the art and music design than Kaufman) you will have this.It makes it matter that it is his first film as director. Also that it is perhaps Hofman's twentieth film in a folded role made large enough by Kaufman as Arthur Miller. Moreover that he compresses the last two acts into a suspended death, one of dense concentration of vitality. The cloud of women that he writes in to surround him is the thing that stellates this layered sky. Its built on a redhead of course, the one who serves as a gateway to his world.Here is one flatting of the plot: A theater director is staging a novel version of ""Salesman,"" working out minute novelties while he enters the play with his life in a way that the entry is explicit. His own life at 31 is characterized by ""why""so he builds a play city around the apartment of his wife (numbered 31Y) who he imagines has left him. ""Imagines"" here is not separate from life, nor the visceral truth of the play. His wife is a similar soul, creating images of her life in a way (extreme miniatures) that requires an engagement of the viewer similar to what this film requires. There's a marriage counselor who has written books that are conflated with the play(s).Its a fantastic construction, ""fantastic"" in both senses. Its as highly structured as ""Irreversible,"" and as literate, as layered as ""Vanya on 42nd st,"" as touching as, say a Tarkovsky. This matters. I don't know yet whether it is among the best two films of 2008.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
65,"Synecdoche, New York",2,18 February 2009,"Kaufman, the director...","SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK is Charlie Kaufman's first film as a director, and his sixth as a screenwriter. Kaufman has supplied us with some of the most delightful mind-benders in recent years, and if not just layered with surrealism they all have a wonderful heart. His latest is another trip into a landscape of oddity, with serious and not so serious questions around life and all it's hidden treasures. Earlier, his film's may have had some unreasoned or unexplainable outcomes, but they've been managed by a fresh breath of air in different directors, most successfully Spike Jonze (and to mention George Clooney and Michael Gondry). This time he takes direction in his own hands, and he puts a characteristic, dirty palette and sets a depressive tone to it, so nobody's to blame Kaufman for resting on his laurels. With the Kaufman foundation, there's everything I love about him, but throughout I got the feeling of Kaufman putting himself in a tight corner during this. His soloing management becomes a knot of unanswered questions, loose ends and mind-trips all too weird to mention. Think about David Lynch, he is a great director, no doubt about that, but make him film a apple, and suddenly it's all a masterpiece. Why? Because it's Lynch, and well, he's probably the single most important and most successful surrealist in cinema history. Kaufman is surely one of the most original screenwriters Hollywood's ever seen, but when handpicking from his own arsenal, all by himself and with nobody to artistically co-operate with, Kaufman goes into overload."
66,"Synecdoche, New York",2,16 January 2009,"I'm sorry, are we talking about the same movie here?","I seem to be in the minority here, but I absolutely hated this movie. And for the life of me I cannot understand why this received an average of 7.9 out of 10 on IMDb. One of the earlier reviews cited this movie ""flirts with pretentiousness"" - well I didn't see any flirting going on; this movie reveled in it. Honestly if there were any good take-home messages about love lost or regret I completely missed them in the sheer ridiculousness of the storyline. The movie was so over-the-top sentimental it really made it unbearable. And the characters were so unlikeable and unbelievable that it just made the movie a complete waste. It's not that I don't appreciate subtlety or poignancy or movies that take a long time to develop - this just was not one of those movies. So if I can convince even one person not to waste his or her time on this snooze fest, I've accomplished something. Avoid this at all costs."
67,"Synecdoche, New York",5,1 December 2009,clever but unsatisfying,"It's hard to know what to say about this one. It starts out as just a bleak movie about a depressed guy with mysterious ailments, and for a good chunk of the movie it looks like that's all there's going to be. Then odd surrealistic elements start popping up and time comes loose from its moorings. And eventually the central concept of the ultimate play is introduced.All this weird stuff is kind of interesting, and kind of intriguing, and there are some really clever ideas mixed into it all, yet the movie seems aimless and far too depressing. Not that depressing is bad, but in a way it doesn't mesh with the surrealism.I think Kaufmann just had too many ideas he wanted to stick in. The central play is a really great idea that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, but I feel it would have worked a lot better if that had been the entire focus; in other words, make a fairly straightforward movie with a weird but almost plausible mechanism rather than pile weirdness on top of weirdness. Kaufmann's goal seems to have been to out-weird his previous screenplays, and he certainly succeeds there, but it just loses focus. And you can argue that a self-indulgent, unfocused movie is perfect when it's about a self-indulgent, unfocused play, but ultimately it seems like Kaufmann is just saying, I'm messed up, the world is messed up, and I'm just going to toss the whole mess at you and let you manage it as best you can.Sure, it's art. But Kaufmann has in the past been great at combining art with entertainment, and here the entertainment has been tossed out in favor of a statement that is never clear. And by making a less entertaining film, Kaufmann has managed to simply highlight where he fails as an artist."
68,"Synecdoche, New York",5,26 October 2009,One weird and incredibly depressive ride; but a failed one,"Well, first, I've got to say, for his first job as director, Charlie Kaufman handled it pretty well, although I'd say he still lacks the ability to know when the pacing is not working. He got some pretty good performances on this film, and handled the whole technical aspects of film pretty well.Sadly, the job should've gone to Spike Jonze, as he would be able to filter out the madness and stick to what a film is supposed to be.Charlie Kaufman seems to be stuck into filming ""meta-fiction"", into adding little bits of witty, nonsensical humorous dialog, surrealism and recursive references (this guy playing this guy who plays this guy, or this guy inside this guy). So this time it's a play inside of a play, going on almost on real time with no purpose. Oh I get it. Clever.But Charlie Kaufman gets lost in it. He leaves the whole ""Adaptation""/""Eternal Sunshine"" reality to go to David Lynch territory here. Now don't get me wrong, I love ""Eraserhead"" and I'm fine with him going a bit surreal or non sensical, but he just throws the absurd on screen for no purpose. He messes with time, with reality, with the main character's disabilities, for no purpose, only to have it there. What was the point of Philip Seymour Hofman not controlling his tears or the way he takes soup? It was there for the kick of it. Because it is ""weird"". There was no clear connection to the whole point, and people are not going to be able to read Mr. Kaufman's mind, and we are not stupid if we cannot ""see it"". The whole film is a justification for the plot and ideas he wants to represent, not the contrary. He forces the whole surreal state into the audience and begs us to buy it, or to try to understand it. It doesn't work that way! Lynch knows it. Kaufman doesn't. Kaufman seems to throw his audience into confusion on purpose. A film should not require two or three viewings to ""get it"", no matter who wrote it or what his purpose was - unless he wanted us to buy more tickets. Or the DVD. But, all in all, the whole idea of what Kaufman meant to do was neat in a way, and buried in a gigantic mess of a film there are a few good messages, good scenes, a solid acting, and some 2 hours of entertainment. I wouldn't say I lost 2 hours of my life seeing this, because it pretty much served its purpose as a film, even though it was sad and depressing as hell - kudos on the whole ""pathos"" thing. But he could do better. I hope he does, when his next movie comes out, maybe 10 years from now, considering how fast he works, or how much work he is in need now to pay his bills."
69,"Synecdoche, New York",4,3 March 2009,"No, Please, This was Too Much!!","I'm giving this film a ""4"" because its a mixture of what is wonderful and brilliant - the acting; and terribly, terribly flawed - the screenplay.I won't mention anything about the plot or the characters except to say that it starts out wonderfully and as most other observers have said, and very strange. Nobody had told me a thing about the film. I just saw that Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in it. Because he is one of the most brilliant actors alive, I will watch anything with him in it. And Hoffman is absolutely brilliant in this.And every other actor and actress turns in wonderful performances. So if you want to see wonderful acting, do go see it.And if you love Macabre, and over-the-edge, unrelenting, merciless, very serious, unforgiving, scene-after-scene of mind-boggling, like I said, strangeness and sadness too, then you won't be disappointed here.Why and who labeled this movie a comedy?You know, I was a performer for 40 years, played lots of cameos in films, have seen hundreds of movies over the years, and I cannot for the life of me figure out how this thing would fit into the category of even ""dark"" or ""black comedy"". (It is more like Polanski's ""The Tenant""). It is absolutely too, too surreal. After a while, you cannot even sympathize with any character anymore because you have been hammered with this steamrolled melange of pathetic situations. But, hey, like I said, if you like Mr. Hoffman, you'll at least appreciate his craft. And the work of the others - Bravo to all.However, the film will leave you, I wager, very unsatisfied."
70,"Synecdoche, New York",5,29 November 2008,"Great directing, but still a disappointing watch","I've been a big fan of Charlie Kaufman's work for awhile. Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, all written by Kaufman, are among my favorite movies. Synecdoche, New York (2008) was not only written by Kaufman, but it was his debut as a director as well, so I had very high hopes....And I really can't say anything bad about the directing of Synecdoche. It looked fantastic, and he got really great performances out of the actors. The real problem with this film is that it makes very little sense.The first half-hour was pretty clear cut and easy to follow. After that the movie got pretty trippy. Time kept jumping forward without the main character realizing it - which might have been explained by these weird medical problems he was having, but they kind of dropped that whole thing halfway through the movie. There were lots of surrealist elements, which I was expecting in a Kaufman movie, but there was no clear understanding of what it all meant. After awhile this film seemed more interested in being like a Russian nesting doll than it did about characters or plot.Now, I'm sure there is some well thought-out meaning behind everything in this movie - meaning only Kaufman himself can fully appreciate. It seems to me that Kaufman had too much involvement in this, and maybe this is why his screenplays have worked so well in the past. He kind of needs somebody else to say to him, ""yeah, this might make sense to you, but nobody else in the world will have any possible chance of grasping meaning out of it."""
71,"Synecdoche, New York",10,7 July 2013,One of the Great American Movies,"There are times when it's difficult to put into words why something has moved you. You might not be able to reason it out. All the same, you've been moved.There are times when an artist, aiming high, will be condemned as pretentious, obscure, smug, too clever by half. Charlie Kaufman knows that for sure, since he puts it into his film. But he aims high anyway. As far as I'm concerned, he's made it to the summit.Mr Kaufman shows us how art can be both affirmation and avoidance of living. Also, that life must end, even if art never does. Not subjects for those whose spotless minds know only sunshine. To those to whom darkness is no stranger, this movie sings out.Harold Pinter said of Samuel Beckett ""He is the most courageous, remorseless writer going,and the more he grinds my nose in the sh-t the more I am grateful to him."" Exactly.You'll note that IMDb won't let me spell out one of Harold Pinter's words in full, which I'm sure would have outraged him. I'm not too pleased about it either. Sometimes you have to tell it like it is. Charlie Kaufman knows that: he put it in his film."
72,"Synecdoche, New York",10,16 February 2012,"This, ladies and gents, is pure art.","I've always admired Charlie Kaufman's work, he has yet to write (or now, direct) a movie that I haven't liked - some more than others, but all very innovative and well done. Philip Seymour Hoffman has truly outdone himself in this epic. I feel that it is his best performance to date - and yes, that includes the much lauded ""Capote"". He was mesmerizing, as was the movie. The way Mr. Kaufman conveyed the nuances of this story through imagery and the manipulation of perceived time (it passes for you, as a viewer, much in the same way it does for Caden Cotard - disorienting in a sense, also tragic) was pure genius. In that way, it parallels Chris Nolan's ""The Prestige"", wherein the movie becomes the magic trick - this movie becomes an extension of Caden Cotard in every sense. Everyone is an extension of his ego/pathos in one way or another.. until he finally realizes, sadly at the end of his life, that ""There are nearly thirteen million people in the world. None of those people is an extra. They're all the leads of their own stories. They have to be given their due. Finally understanding that his pain is only a different flavor of what everyone experiences - this is life.Edit Review Delete Review You wrote"
73,"Synecdoche, New York",10,13 February 2010,Incredibly ambitious yet it succeeds,"As a big fan of Eternal Sunshine and Being John Malkovitch, I saw that one with expectations set incredibly high. Did I come out disappointed? Quite the opposite.Charlie Kaufman delivers what probably is his best movie despite being incredibly ambitious on this project. I can't even fathom what the script must have looked like. He simply filmed the unfilmable.The performances are stellar. And I mean S.T.E.L.L.A.R. Philip Seymour Hoffman nails it. Everything flows effortlessly. The photography assists the story, completing it. It's just brilliant cinematography.I think I'm running out of superlatives here - but this one is a home run, and has just entered by top 10 favorite movies of all time."
74,"Synecdoche, New York",8,20 September 2008,It was funny and deep the way only Kaufman is.,"This movie,the first directing attempt by Kaufman left me speechless.For the 120something minutes I was watching with my mouth wide open.It was funny and deep the way only Kaufman is.Philip Seymour Hoffman was simply amazing.What he tried to do in Being John Malkovich and Adaptation,about the tormenting nature of the artist,as he sees him,or as he sees himself,in this movie is, by far, accomplished.Maybe a bit too long but leaves you with a deep feeling and is interesting till the very end.It is more weird, and sometimes too obviously,than all his other movies put together.This first universe created from Kaufman is very promising and still young.Let's hope for more."
75,"Synecdoche, New York",8,8 December 2009,The Fundamental Loneliness of the Human Condition,"A film that's quite easy to understand once you know what the title gives away.Here's the song that opens the film:There's a place I long to be A certain town that's dear to me Home to Mohawks and G.E. It's called SchenectadyI was born there and I'll die there My first home I hope to buy there Have a kid or at least try there Sweet Schenectady.The play on ""Schenectady"" (where the film is set) and ""Synecdoche"" (a literary device in which parts are taken for the whole) is a simple summary of where this film is headed. It's all about life being lived in ""Synecdoche"".""Synecdoche"": that's where most of us live our lives. Parts for the whole. We count heads when we mean people, we count hands on deck when we mean people on deck. Everyone at any moment is essentially a fragment in another's consciousness. All other people are but fragments of their entire selves, drifting in and out of the landscape of our lives. And turning it about, we too are nothing but fragments in the lives of other people. Our lives are lived in that essential no-man's land between who we are, what we expect ourselves to be, and what others expect of us, and it is in between these three forces that we are shaped, often to extents to beyond the limits of our comprehension. Every few years or so we stand back and try to reassess the directions in which our lives have gone, and we reassess it and reassess it, but we come to no definitive answer to that riddle wrapped in a mystery wrapped in an enigma. Yet, despite all this, we come into the world alone, we leave this world alone. And what happens between does not do anything to detract from that fundamental loneliness.Kaufman's character, Caden Cotard, is an everyman, rather than a representation of an artist per se. He could be you, or me. The film mixes surrealism and realism because what it is the most complete visualization of a frame of mind and a state of being: that fundamental loneliness of the human condition, that we are all faced with. Anything on screen could be real, could be imagined, and is often a fusion between the real and imagined with little regard for either because it does not matter which is which. When Caden sees that stripper thinking it is Olive, is it really Olive? Is it really Olive that's dying on the bed? Do weeks, months or years fly by? Is it all a state of mind or does it really matter? It doesn't. Life is so much lived in the mind anyway. That is the source of its fundamental loneliness.Synecdoche, NY is a VISUALIZATION of this concept and how it plays out on one man's life. That one man is every man, and every man is that one man."
76,"Synecdoche, New York",,19 October 2009,Watered down David F. Wallace,"""Context is key. From that comes the understanding of everything."" - Kenneth Noland Charlie Kaufman's ""Synecdoche, New York"" can be loosely divided into three sections. In the first we're introduced to Caden Cotard, a theatre director who is busy preparing a production of Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman"". Cotard is obsessed with death, the perishability of flesh, diseases, old age and psychological disorders. The name Cotard is itself a reference to ""Cotard's syndrome"", a mental disorder in which the subject believes that he is already dead.So Cotard is a gloomy depressive, part Woody Allen and part an amalgamation of every neurotic character Kaufman's ever written. Played by Philip Hoffman, Caden is a tired man rendered perpetually gloomy by his sheer hyper-sensitivity. As Sharon Lind states in ""Overexcitability and The Gifted"", people with emotional excitability, often artists, manic-depressives or philosophers, ""are acutely aware of their own feelings and of how they are growing and changing, often carrying out inner dialogues and practising self-judgement."" In other words, the truly creative mind is no more than a creature born or pushed towards an abnormal hyper-sensitivity. This deep ""attunment"" then becomes either a blessing or a curse, and is often either channelled into creative endeavours, or numbed via drugs, sex, technology, art, alcohol etc, all of which serve as a means of numbing stimulus. The choice of having Caden stage a production of ""Salesman"" is significant. Miller's play was about a businessman obsessed with attaining greatness, despite the fact that he was wholly untalented. In ""Synecdoche"", however, we have Caden Cotard become a stand in for writer Charlie Kaufman, both artists trying to overcome their respective existential problems by attaining greatness through art. IE - they're both intimately aware of their own mortality (and inconsequentiality) and so seeking to achieve immortality (and fame) through ""great art"". So the first section of ""Synecdoche"" is simply a gloomy rehash of everything directors like Antonioni, Bergman, Wenders and Allen have done before (turn to literature, and such meta-fictional, postmodern crises are even more common - see David Wallace, Chris Ware et al - but of course nobody reads anymore). Kaufman may think he's latched on to some profound human truth, but his paean to suffering will seem limp to anyone who has read a little Satre, Camus, Dostoyevsky or Heidegger. For a film which begins with the line ""I think I'm dying"" and ends with the whisper ""Die"", the picture says surprisingly little about life and death, Kaufman content to simply wallow in despair.A compressed version of Wenders' ""Parix, Texas"", the second section of the film is no better. Caden separates from his wife, has a series of sexual affairs, and attempts to track down his missing daughter. We watch as he buries his pain is sex and vices, but Kaufman never really explores these escapes. Everything is handled with a quirky, very snide tone. Compare this to Solondz's ""Storytelling"" and ""Happiness"" or Tamara Jenkins' ""The Savages"", the later two being better films in which Philip Hoffman essentially plays the same character undergoing the same problems. But it's all outdated existentialism (ie bourgeois nihilism). The kind of white middle-class malaise that Sam Mendes churns out, without much regard for any wider real-life, socio-economic context (ie cause).Luckily the third section of the film deals exclusively with context. This is where Kaufman's playful genius kicks in. Cotard receives a Macarthur Genius Grant and is given funding to create a ""revolutionary theatre experience"" which is brutal in its honesty. ""I won't settle for anything less than the brutal truth!"" he exclaims.And so Caden begins his magnum opus, constructing a vast theatre experience inside a disused warehouse. His play's story is nothing less than a reconstruction of his entire life, and consists of thousands of actors, doppelgangers, huge sets and hundreds of subplots. Gradually the production mutates and overwhelms the source material. Scenes from the play and scenes from life become interchangeable. Actors are hired to play the actors who are hired to play the actors who are hired to play the actors. The play expands, gradually becoming an ever-expanding world, the narrative morphing into a more literate version of Lynch's ""Inland Empire"".Really, what Caden is attempting to create here is a work of art in which every action, every choice, every character, is subject to an unbreakable chain of dramatised causes and effects. ""There are nearly thirteen million people in the world,"" he says, ""None of these people are an extra! They have to be given their due!"" And so Caden wishes to map everything. He wishes to put every gesture, every human being, in proper context, a desire which is of course wholly impossible, as you'd need a work of art that stretched back to the beginning of time and extended far beyond your own death. In contrast, Caden's wife is an artist who focuses on the minute. She is a painter whose paintings gradually become smaller and smaller, focusing on single, seemingly inconsequential details. Significantly, she is happy and successful. Ignorance is bliss, after all, and existential misery stems precisely from the super-awareness of one's place in the universe (ie context).The film ends on a powerful note, Caden's ""ego dying"" such that he ""let's go"" directorial control of his own ""stage-play"" (ie to cease being the ordering force in his life and move on). But what the film does best is show how decision making is timeless. Consider one scene in which a character's decision to buy a house also includes her decision to marry a certain man and die in that same house. She is made wholly accountable for her actions, including those she could not possible foresee in the real world. Kauffman's point: context is truth, but truth is suffering.7.9/10  Though its existential musings are trite, the film's third section is genius. Worth two viewings."
77,"Synecdoche, New York",8,16 March 2009,Fully realized journey of dread,"Navel gazing. Self-indulgent. One is tempted to level both criticisms at Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut. But the film doesn't end its gaze at the navel--it keeps burrowing in deeper, past the lint, through the dermis, and into the bowels of the writer/director. And faulting him for self-indulgence is redundant since the film is clearly a journey into the fevered psyche of Kaufman where we are asked to sort out the details. We are invited to Be John Malko--I mean Charlie Kaufman. We have been let off at the 7 1/2th floor and entered the Kaufman door.Kaufman, of course, scripted ""Being John Malkovich"" and with ""Synecdoche"" he revisits some of the same ontological and phenomenological territory. What is the self? How do I perceive myself, others, and the universe? ""Malkovich,"" however, was buoyant, playful, and wacky and closed with a hopeful coda while ""Synecdoche"" makes a beeline straight for the pain. We will wallow in it with playwright Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Kaufman's doppleganger, and live through a lifetime of regret in two hours. The different tones of the two films has to do in part with directors. Spike Jonze brought a light, inventive touch while Kaufman is just as content to let images sit still for contemplation. Even the visual inventiveness, and this film is not in short supply, does not pop and delight. It causes dread and unease.But this is surely the point. The film begins in a relatively straightforward manner. Cotard is depressed and having difficulties in his marriage to Adele (Catherine Keener). He is anxious about his staging of ""Death of a Salesman"" and has begun a flirtation with the theater's ticket seller (Samantha Morton). The film appears to be a normal domestic drama, but as the minutes pass we know something is slightly off. By the time we visit the house that's always on fire, the film has become completely unmoored from reality as we know it and we have to begun to experience the director's existential dread right alongside of him.The film is endlessly creative but too self-involved to stir most audiences. As with Woody Allen, Kaufman's films appear to be therapy where he works out his issues and neuroses on screen. It has been said that you are everyone in your dreams and Kaufman teases this out in his films to the point where you are also everyone in your waking life and a god as well. It's a solipsistic existence that's finally intensely lonely. The commercial prospects for this were clearly limited. Kaufman breaks free of typical narrative convention and lets his ideas take the lead.""Synecdoche"" is filled with ideas and strong female performers. Catherine Keener, Dianne Weist, Emily Watson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Samantha Morton, Hope Davis, and Michelle Williams all give fascinating performances. It's exciting to see so many accomplished actresses in challenging roles all in one film. The film follows no predictable pattern and continually surprises. It's a fully realized depiction of dread and longing, but not completely convincing in its convictions."
78,"Synecdoche, New York",4,7 April 2009,An Artist's Existential Nightmare,"Lots of praise for this film here, but not enough to convince me to give it a second go. I think this might make the best short film ever, but coming in at 2 hours, it starts to feel like Andy Warhol's ""Raygun"". Kaufman's self-indulgent existential nightmare takes us deep inside his own neurosis, paranoia, and depression. ""Adaptation"" (one of my favorite films) took me far enough already, though. Honest and challenging? Hell yeah! Great performances? Incredible. And some really hilarious moments: the New Yorker kind of high brow sh*t us Indie film folk love. But I guess this kind of ""challenging"" is not for me... maybe if I ever get the courage to watch this hot mess again, I'll challenge myself with a bong rip first. I'm sure Catherine Keener would approve."
79,"Synecdoche, New York",2,1 March 2009,Charlie wants to be an artist.,"Sorry to say that, but I gave up halfway through and walked out. Not angry even, but thoroughly bored and unaffected.You remember Charlie Kaufman? If not, he's that movie screen writer who wrote the scripts for some mildly entertaining flicks, like ""Being John Malkovich"". Now please understand that, when I say mildly entertaining, it's a a huge compliment. Which to me applies to at most 1% of big screen releases coming out of the American studio system.So Kaufman can be entertaining, and he sure made them companies and himself some good money. Great for him you'd think. Turns out though it's not enough. Charlie doesn't want to be just a showman and likely even feels bad about the success he had with what he himself might consider not worth it. No sir, Charlie wants to be an artist, and make that fact unmistakably clear to us.That's for example why this movie takes place in a stage theater setting. Because movies are brainless business, everybody knows that, so it has to be theater, the possibly last stronghold of true artistry in the world of plays and acting. And in this setting, we're supposed to follow a theater director through his struggles while he pursues his artistic dream. And all through the way the film seems to be clamoring ""see, this is important, this is the tough life a true and totally misunderstood artist has and which I, Charlie, actually don't have but would like to because, after all, I too have a desire to feel authentic"". OK, Charlie, I understand that, no need to shout. But frankly, I have a feeling you lack both the talent and depth, no offense meant. Please just be comfortable with being a movie screen writer and proceed with that.So guys, if you're going to sit through this be prepared you gotta listen to Charlie for a while. And try to make sure you don't pay for this, because - in a reasonable world - Charlie should pay you, for lending him your ear, eye, time and attention."
80,"Synecdoche, New York",3,24 November 2008,Life sucks then you die theme at it's most labored and pretentious.,"Films about conflicted artists in free fall can make for some compelling cinema. Fellini and Bergman were masters at conveying this in films such as 8 1/2 and Persona. Sad and distressing as the storyline might be they avoided alienating the audience with stunning visuals and dialogue that contributed to well metered pacing. In this arduous just over two seems like four hour tortured artist tale writer, director Charlie Kaufman drags the audience through one of the biggest downers in ages that is merit-less in every way save for the remarkable performance of Seymour Philip Hoffman as the hapless but revered theatre director with a disastrous personal life, Caden Cotard.As in his previous scripts, the brilliant Being John Malkovich, excellent Adaptation and lame Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kaufman plays head games early and often. Like the deconstructing protagonists in his earlier films he works along two plains: a hazy reality and inside the paranoid terror stricken psyche of his main character. In his previous films comedy relief balanced the absurdity but here it remains buried under excretory obsession (today's comedy staple)and the scrambled ramblings of the joyless Cotard. After an hour of this interminable glumness it is more than evident that Caden is only descending into deeper paranoia where he remains for the rest of the film trying to create a brutally honest work of art and remaining in self denial the whole ride. Wow, what irony.What completes this mess of a film beyond it's confusing storyline and sloppy pretension is the lack of pacing, a murky mise en scene of bland imagery and a steady stream of cold zombie like characters costumed in serious metaphor.I'm sure intellectual elites with their highly evolved insight will probably wax on eloquently about Kaufman's daring, uncompromising artistry, even do a sentence or two on the significance of bowel movements in the film. I prefer Bergman melding faces of Ullman and Anderson and Fellini's circus ring approach to this thing known as the Human Comedy. I'll leave poor Charlie flailing away at attempting to be the edgiest but in turn the grossest kid in the schoolyard. Flush this crap."
81,"Synecdoche, New York",,22 December 2008,The Emperor has no clothes.,"Alright. I love Kaufmann as much as the next guy, but let's get this straight. There is not a single person posting a review here that actually enjoyed this movie, let alone understood it. You all want to say that it moved you, that it was deep, and maybe you've convinced yourself of that. In the same way that you thought Mulholland Drive was an epic piece of cinema. It wasn't. Sometimes, filmmakers get a little lost and can't find their way back, and this is unfortunately the result of that. A better director, and a more objective point of view of the story, would have brought the script down to a more palatable, accessible level that the rest of us can understand. But as it is, it's a complicated script, told in a non-linear and even more complicated manner. I'm sure there were a lot of ass-kissing producers afraid to actually speak up and say ""Uh, I'm not sure I get it."" Great performances and fantastic production design do not a good movie make. Sorry Charlie."
82,"Synecdoche, New York",3,15 June 2009,Imagine If They Castrated David Lynch....,"I'm beginning to think ""Adaptation"" was a fluke. Some of the most absurd, surreal films like ""Brazil"" and ""The Machinist"" are among my favorites. But others like ""The Element of Crime"" and ""Naked Lunch"" I found to be long and annoying. What's the difference between the two groups? What makes a film fascinating instead of tiring? Before I am willing to go through the mental gymnastics the filmmakers must make me a give a crap what happens to the characters. If they do I will follow them to end even if it that end makes no sense at all. I remember when I first saw ""Lost Highway"". I was a bit baffled but still left the theater with a sense of closure. David Lynch created a great sense of mystery at the beginning of that film. And I did feel an affinity with the characters. ""Synecdoche"" failed to make that connection. It's also rambling and could have been more succinct. I was so annoyed that I almost popped it out of the DVD about 1.5 hours into it. Kaufman could easily have lost 30-45 minutes in the cutting room. In the end Kaufman does wrap it up and makes his point very clearly. It's obvious what he's been trying to say. But despite the resolution I don't recommend this film. There are a few a few genuinely witty moments but overall it's a neurotic bummer. The whole next day I felt like my brain needed a shower. Imagine if they castrated David Lynch, loaded him up with Valium and gave him a crew. You'd get something like this."
83,"Synecdoche, New York",6,31 October 2008,both sides are right,"when ""the suits"" have too much say, you get Beverly Hills Chihuahua. when they have too little say, you get Synecdoche, New York.Synecdoche, New York does have all of the weaknesses described by those who hated it.it also has all of the strengths described by those who loved it.personally, there is no way i would miss seeing PSH, Hope Davis, Tom Noonan, Dianne Wiest and an equally superb cast of other players acting their heart out.scenes from this movie will be recurring to me many years from now (especially Hope Davis's role).but, otoh, seeing this film was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, literally as well as figuratively."
84,"Synecdoche, New York",10,24 October 2008,Life-changing,"Not many filmmakers can get me out to see a midnight showing on opening day, but Charlie Kaufman is one.This is a remarkably touching film that explores a life devoted to art, the nobility/delusion of that life, how art and life merge, inform one another. It's about the pace and pathos of life, the battle against loneliness, the beauty of second chances, and so much more.What kind of world do we live in? A world that we construct based on experiences we've had. A world in which our character is defined as much by what other people tell us to think than by our own originality. A world in which other people constantly play us and re-interpret our choices, sometimes right and sometimes wrong. A world that's entirely constructed by us but is based on materials we've picked up along the way.In Kaufman's universe it's the real world that's surreal, that breezes past, that co-opts our children, bastardizes our language. In the real world we get boils on our skin, blood in our gums, tremors in our leg. In the real world therapists finish our sentences for us and our children grow up to be whores. But in the world of art we're healthy, we age gracefully, we have time to construct our ideas, re-interpret our words, look at ourselves from different angles at different times in different places; we're able to study the people we're surrounded with, get them right, eventually. In one way or another these themes permeate all of Kaufman's movies. Malkovich questioned the self -- who's the puppeteer pulling our strings. Adaptation blurred life and art. Eternal Sunshine was about the inevitability of our individual condition despite whatever manipulations we undergo/impose.In Synecdoche, Caden can't seem to master life so he re-creates it, immerses himself in his creation, explores his condition, tries to right wrongs, and traps himself in a world that is actually more free than the one he's escaping. He lives this illusory life while the world crumbles outside. And in the end he becomes a player, playing himself, like others have, taking direction from a higher authority (but who is someone he actually cast... nice comment on religion by Charlie). In the end he's left with an empty shell, like we all are.This is meta-fiction at it's most emotional. Like Nabokov, the best in the literary world, Kaufman's other movies perfect the mechanics of self-reference but stop short of evoking real emotion (except by appreciation of their genius), but this is a work of art that impresses so much on both intellectual and emotional levels. Vlad, Shakespeare, etc. all would have been proud. (BTW, was Caden's moon title idea a reference to ""Pale Fire""?)Charlie deals with love in a more complete and touching way than I think I've ever seen. Caden's real life marriage is heartless, but the right girl has been there all along, waiting with his ticket. Same theme as Eternal Sunshine, second chances, doing what's in your heart despite the inevitable imperfections. It takes time, and more than one opportunity but he's trying, always trying, to get it right, to make things a little better.Few movies actually make you look at the world differently when you leave the theater. This was one for me. Hopefully Charlie will never let anyone else direct his scripts again."
85,"Synecdoche, New York",10,22 October 2008,"Meta-fiction At Its Finest, or: How New Overtook Old, And Old Replaced New","If you loved ""Adaptation"" (and I'm assuming that if you're reading this you did) then you must see ""Synecdoche, New York"". I repeat: you MUST see ""Synecdoche, New York"". The film is a beautiful tale focusing on a dying man who -- after receiving a MacArthur Fellowship Grant -- devotes the remainder of his life to creating a copy of himself, his life, and, ultimately, the world around him in a play to be immortalized. The story may sound straight-forward enough, but, in true Kaufman fashion, is anything but. As the movie progresses, real life and the play begin to blend together, characters playing real people switch, interact with one another, and eventually, the play takes over the main character's real life and begin to direct him. By the end of the plot ""old"" and ""original"" has been replaced by ""new""; and everything ""new"" has been replaced by the ""original"". It is a phenomenal film and I highly recommend it."
86,"Synecdoche, New York",2,31 March 2009,"Overlong, tedious, pretentious - an odd mess.  See 8 1/2 or the BBC's The Singing Detective instead","Stalwart Philip Seymour Hoffman and some of the excellent cast, including Emily Watson and Jennifer Jason Leigh, cannot save this movie from being one of the decade's worse failures. After writing brilliant scripts such as ""Adaptation"" or ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" Charlie Kaufman tries directing and the result is a colossal, self-indulgent mess of a film that cannot engage viewers at an emotional level or make much intellectual sense despite its ambitions.All of Kaufman's earlier themes are here - mind illusions, absurdity of life, fractured unresolved relationships - but this time presented in a boring epic scenario. Hofman plays a regional theater director afflicted by a mental disorder that includes hypochondria, paranoia, and dissociation. Divorce, marriage, work, daily activities are experienced in a dream state. He gets a grant that enables him to create a play about his life transforming a large warehouse into a replica of New York but the process become endless as the play and his life became reflections of each other confusing him, the actors, and needless to say the viewers.Although the film attempts to be a meditation on meaningful themes, such as the transitory nature of life and creating art, its two-hour plus length, poorly-edited pace, and convoluted plot turn it into a boring, meaningless experience. If you want get into the mind of a director, see Fellini's 8 1/2 - a masterpiece for the ages. If you want to experience the feverish imagination of a writer while tortured by illness, see the BBC's mini-series ""The Singing Detective."" These are unforgettable films. ""Synechdoche New York"" is a film probably most viewers would like to soon forget."
87,"Synecdoche, New York",3,30 December 2008,"""Can't say its enjoyable"" is an understatement","Enjoyed and was intrigued by first 30 minutes. After that I've never wished for the death of a protagonist so desperately. His death would mean credits roll, and I could leave. If I hadn't made the mistake of encouraging others to join me, I would have walked. The performances were all solid (except Jennifer Jason Leigh, she once had potential, didn't she?) Loved all the boobs, though. Nothing livens up a bad movie like great knockers. First Samantha Morton in push-up, then Michelle Williams in transparent top then Emily Watson full-sheila,top(It would be needlessly cruel to count PhilSeyHoff's though) Needed hot coffee, shower and nap after this four hour tour de torture. What? It was only two hours? Huh, seemed longer.....much"
88,"Synecdoche, New York",3,8 April 2009,pedestrian at best,"Phenomenal? Some think so. Certainly, ""Loveseedgems"" thinks so, and even goes on to declare this movie ""authentic art."" Those who disagree, I presume, are adjudged artless. And, so I am reminded of walking through a museum containing works of the greatest Dutch and Renaissance masters....alongside a snow shovel. Yes, the ""authentic art"" of an actual snow shovel. And so we have the same thing here. A movie filled with drivel that leads NOWHERE. We are not philosophically challenged by this movie and we are not certainly moved by the people populating it. We are just reminded of the warts and bowel movements and unpleasantness we all have. Nothing more nothing less and certainly, nothing philosophical; nothing Nietzschean; nothing to make you wonder about a broader truth, or a narrower one. If you want great philosophy, read Nietzsche or Kierkegaard. But don't expect to find it in this movie. And, if you want to see a superb rendering of the dark spiral into dementia, see ""A Beautiful Mind"". On a positive note, P.S.Hoffman is truly one of the greatest acting talents in Hollywood today and gives a phenomenal performance in this movie. Too bad the character he's playing is as dislikeable as an old wool sock left out in the rain."
89,"Synecdoche, New York",5,3 December 2008,"200 Words on  Synecdoche, New York","I suppose only truly great filmmakers don't make bad movies. Which leads me to believe that Charlie Kaufman will never truly be considered a great filmmaker. His directorial debut ""Synecdoche, New York"" is far from great. To be totally honest I don't think their was any real sort of plot to this movie. It all came off like a dream, to use a some what bad clichéd description. All I could really gather from it was that Philip Seymour Hoffman's character was trying to run a play that takes place on a life size version of New York City (or maybe a block of New York City). Other then that I was literally wondering what the hell was going on and just who all these people in the film were. I mean there's the death of Hoffman's parents (in the film obviously) and I said out loud in the theater ""Who the hell was he/she?"" Don't get me wrong I like to think about a movie (Hell I'm still trying to figure out most of David Lynch's movies to this day). But sometimes I really wish that filmmakers (especially ones that I enjoy personally). Would do away with the metaphors/philosophy and just say what they really mean and/or have a plot. I mean seriously what the hell was that ""living in a house that's on fire"" really about? That and about a hundred other things that left me wondering. So in closing unless you really like a totally art house style movie with no plot what so ever (and that's just my opinion), don't see ""Synecdoche, New York"" Stick with ""Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind or Being John Malkovich, which are truly great Charlie Kaufman movies."
90,"Synecdoche, New York",10,28 November 2008,Intellectually Satisfactory,"I won't insult the reader by trying to tell what Synecdoche New York is about or what it means--in part because it has so many ideas, comments and interpretations that the more you think on every piece or every aggregate the more you can get from it.I saw this movie in an Art Theater, and my girlfriend and I were initially annoyed by the fact that much of the audience laughed hysterically at moments that were serious. But later we realized that it's because the movie was too challenging for them, and they were uncomfortable.There are movies that are escapist, and that's okay. And there are movies that make you worse for having seen them because they have no redemptive value (Open Water comes to mind).But then there are movies that make you a better human being, smarter, more aware and intellectually challenged.There are a few movies that I have enjoyed spending hours and days reading into them meaning. This movie has elements of other great movies like Youth Without Youth, Jacob's Ladder or Starting Out in the Evening. But it has its own ideas and will let the viewer take its meaning as deeply as he or she is willing.Shallow people will NOT like this S.N.Y. movie. It's a movie that doesn't spoon feed meaning to you. Taken on the surface it has a plot and a straightforward meaning. But treated like a poem that builds concrete correlatives but then branches off and builds on them, this movie will feed your brain."
91,"Synecdoche, New York",1,9 March 2009,What for?,"just watched this movie and without irony want to say: this movie is incredibly TALENTED, precise, touching, caring, piercing, most gigantic in the history of cinematography - picking in one's own sh.t! this unique taste of meaningless tragedy is hard to spit out.No doubt everybody who worked on this movie did a great job! Acting is perfect, the director has made his point. Make-up is perfect! Decorations and graphic effects are perfect.And what is left after all? Why spend these efforts to get such huge can of human crap out of inside and than make this peculiar analysis for such a long time?"
92,"Synecdoche, New York",1,6 August 2009,2 Hrs I Will Never Get Back Again....,"In a nutshell, this film is long-winded, uninteresting and comprises the most insignificant lead character that you just end up wishing would hurry up and die. No offence to Philip Seymour Hoffman, he tries his best to make Caden likable but the script just keeps knocking him back. Throughout the film, i had the recurring inclination to walk out but i just kept hanging on hoping the film would improve - boy was i wrong! I can't believe people are rating this film so highly, it's just complete nonsense. At the end of the film, i had the same feeling that i had at the end of the David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' - what the hell was that all about!?!"
93,"Synecdoche, New York",7,25 February 2014,"In my opinion, this movie is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's finest hour","Coming from the mind of writer/driver Charlie Kaufman, Synecdoche, New York is a very interesting movie. The plot follows an ailing theater director, Caden Cotard (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) as he works on an increasingly elaborate stage production about his life, whose extreme commitment to realism begins to blur the boundaries between fiction and reality due to suffering from numerous physical ailments and growing increasingly alienated from his wife. The film's title is a play on words. Schenectady, New York, where much of the film is set, and the concept of synecdoche, wherein a part of something represents the whole, or vice versa. The movie has this odd concept, that symbolism a lot of the film themes about choosing how to live life. Both Caden and his wife Adele (Catherine Kenner) are artists, and the scale on which both of them work during their lifetime becomes increasingly relevant to the story as the film progresses. Adele works on an extremely small scale, while Caden works on an impossibly large scale. Adele's work getting smaller and smaller, while Caden constructing a full-size replica of New York City in a warehouse, and eventually a warehouse within that warehouse, and so on, continuing in this impossible cycle. In the end, saying to focus more on small tasks, than trying to continue on one impossible big task. The burning house early in the film represented dogmatic choices. Caden buries himself ever deeper into his magnum opus, blurring the line between the world of the play and that of reality by populating the cast and crew with doppelgängers almost like a weird Capgras delusion. Capgras is a disorder where sufferers think family & friends had been replaced by identical imposters. The movie has this William Shakespeare's meta-referential feeling to it, as it portrays a play within a play or mise en abyme. Indeed, the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. Great supporting cast from a lot of great actors like Samantha Morton as Hazel, Tom Noonan as Sammy Barnathan, Caden's double, Emily Watson as Tammy, Hazel's double, Dianne Wiest as Millicent Weems who plays Ellen Bascomb and another of Caden's doubles, Michelle Williams as Claire Keen. In short, when you physically sit down and watch the movie, the beginning of the movie is not actually the beginning. We never see when Caden actually gets the grant in this interpretation. The movie presents itself as being in the 'real world', but without spoiling too much, there are a lot of hints that it isn't. Like Cotard's portrayal of Death of a Salesman, the film use young actors is represented the old and aging. The film mirrors how Phillip Seymour Hoffman's life. He also started in Death of a Salesman in 2012. I have to say, this is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's greatest acting. I really think it mirrors a little bit too much of his real life and how haunted he may had been. Pretty scary performance if you think about it. Sad, to see him gone. RIP. Phillip Seymour Hoffman. While, others choose to live life different with more positive creative uplifting that leads to more success. Caden continues to have little success due to his negative view of life. As the years rapidly pass, the continually expanding warehouse is isolated from the deterioration of the city outside represent depression and finally when the warehouse is left in ruins. It represent death. Even his last name Cotard, references to Cotard delusion, which means one believing to be dead or that one's organs are missing. Caden feels that his male sex organs are missing. Many people have compared the plot to Jungian sexual psychology. Caden feels small compare to Adele's work, mirrors penis envy or sexual inadequacy. He feels that Adele is more of a man that he would ever be. Hints why Caden is always making things bigger and bigger to over top Adele's success. One theory behind this is that we're seeing things from Caden's perspective, so we see him as an ugly failure and see the women in his life, as ideal beauties. He wants to be a woman, or in a way, is a woman. The movie use symbols like paint to mixed themes like homo erotic with incest that many homosexuals wouldn't like. It paints a negative image toward them. Tattoos foreshadows a lot of events in the movie as if Salvador Dali dream imagery painting. We see a flower tattoo wither away. There are tons more symbolism in the film that you just have to find out for yourself. Also check out, the delete scenes about Squishy the Dog. It's too bad it was cut, because this is actually one of the few hopeful symbols. It's a good movie, but way too depressing. It does have powerful disturbing scenes like the masturbating booth, or Ellen's apartment that merits more discussion with smart movie lovers. This movie is not for weak in heart. The film is a mash-up of Meta Fiction, absurdist theater, Freudian, surrealism, recursive reality, post modernism and mind screw into one. Would you expect any less from a Kaufman movie? Charlie is all about leaving his films open to interpretation, and he's gone all out with the obscure nature of Synecdoche. There is no way to dissect 'Synecdoche, New York'. The central narrative, muddy as it is, smart. It's confusing, but it makes you think."
94,"Synecdoche, New York",3,15 June 2010,Pretentious twaddle disguised as art film,"I did not like this film, despite liking ""Being John Malkovich"" very much. It's an intriguing concept, no doubt. The execution was sorely lacking. A confusing mess of a movie, Caden (the protagonist) goes through his completely self-absorbed life and never realizes until the end that the people in his drama are real people and not just supporting actors to his own life.Most people already know this.So we have another masturbatory narrative of an egotistical ""artiste"" who takes a long, (very, very long, seemingly endless) journey into self-discovery, destroying lives all around him, destroying his own life with his endless examination and analysis, his endless picking at scabs, his endless neurosis, until he comes to no great realization at death's door.Truly, I expected better. I did enjoy the burning house, though. That was well done and an apt metaphor for the way so many women strive to become the subject of their own lives live from day to day."
95,"Synecdoche, New York",3,20 April 2009,Boring and Pretentious.,"...and incredibly depressing. If you were hoping for some of the repressed optimism or humor of his other films, forget it. The film crawls at a snail's pace, and its world is populated by characters that don't seem to have any depth to them besides their indifference to one another.""But that's the point!"" Fine. Then this movie's for you.The descent into the weirdness of the film isn't handled well; it just happens, and either you accept it or you don't.""But that's the point!"" Again, fine. Not for me.I don't mind offbeat or unconventional films, but I do mind when they try a little too hard to be unconventional--and in doing so, fail.The acting is offbeat enough to make some of the characters real, and some of the surreal moments work well. But most of them don't.If you're up for a neurotic depression-fest, this one's for you."
96,"Synecdoche, New York",,4 December 2008,"Ugly, depressing and unsettling which is I guess what life is supposed to be","At least forty five minutes too long and carrying at least three extra layers, Synecdoche is a major disappointment.Let's start with the title...what's up wid dat? Every once in awhile, I'll run into someone bragging about how they are a member of Mensa. I guess this means I'm supposed to think they are intelligent and everything that they do is clothed in wisdom beyond the reckoning of chumps like me but yet I'm supposed to be reverent about their platitudes and melancholy.Hello Synecdoche or whatever this thing is called.In other words, a movie that tries this hard to be intelligent comes across as pretentious and ironically shallow.Give me tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow or what a piece of work is man and let's leave it at that."
97,"Synecdoche, New York",10,3 December 2008,sycosis and psychosis,"Synedoche is one of the greatest films I have ever seen in my life. It was so twisted and strange that it makes you begin to question reality. Society has become extremely conditioned and habituated that throwing a curve ball like this movie at our life is detrimental to the existence of our creativity and intelligence. We need people like Charlie Kaufman in our life because it's inspiring and refreshing to know that there are still people that have no fears, people who let their creativity take over. In an interview Kaufman talks about how he was formulating this idea for this film for so long it was just not the right time. I did not take my eyes off the screen once, because I knew if I did I would be so lost. This film was all over the place, there were so many characters, and it was brilliant! Samuel Beckett couldn't even produce a play that Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character thought of. It was like reading a Kafka book; you had no idea what was going to happen next. The movie is so abstract, absurd, and obscure that you don't even know how to feel. I felt so sad and depressed at the end but I couldn't cry or even really be sad- I was just dumbfounded. I couldn't stop thinking about it and I still can't two days later. There is just so much going on and so much I need to say about. That's how this movie makes you feel, and it is the most genius skill Kaufman has. All his movies are so deep and profound that you can't just forget about them. Every single actor in this film did a DYNAMITE performance. There was a New York quality about it that I really appreciated. The set is pseudo New York, but it looks so real, that you forget that they are actually living on set. Everything Hoffman's character perceives it's duplicated in his play. Each character has their own character, a narrative within a narrative but not in the usual way, this was way more bizarre. There is so much emotional depth in this film that your brain and your heart want to explode. I was laughing and sad, and for a film to actually extract that much emotion from me, it gets too thumbs up. I will watch this movie hundreds of times, and I will probably learn something new every time. It is an eternal epic film that will probably be underrated, but it's OK. Ignorant people won't understand it, to understand it; you may need to be a little eccentric and unique yourself."
98,"Synecdoche, New York",6,16 November 2008,A PoMo Compendium,"While ""Synecdoche..."" is a frequently funny, well acted and fascinatingly inventive film to watch (and why I rated it as highly as I did), I find myself dissenting from the adulation it's receiving in so many of the comments here.My chief problem was the detachment from real human emotion created by excessive indulgence in post-modernist devices. Indeed, as others here have pointed out, Kaufmann focuses even more directly on all manner of meta-fictional tricks in this film than in his previous ones. But, for me, that's exactly what prevents the characters' and what they're experiencing, thinking and feeling from connecting with the viewer. I thought after leaving the theater that, as a compendium of post-modernist literary and film techniques and devices, the film is maybe unsurpassed as an example of what PoMo is all about. But not a good example of how those techniques can enhance our engagement with and understanding of human experience.The actual philosophical and psychological ideas the movie deals with were also a little disappointing for me. Exploring the metaphysics of time and human mortality as didactic topics in film and literature have, by now, become overdone to the point of cliché and I didn't find this example to offer much new. As others, have pointed out, the final 30 minutes draws these didactic, conceptual elements out too long and without the interesting, fun, ironic qualities employed earlier in the film.So, while I had fun with all the myriad varieties of intellectual games Kaufmann was throwing at me and I do recommend this movie to those who likewise enjoy such things (along with the excellent acting, cinematography, set designs, etc.), I will caution potential viewers about possibly leaving the theater with an empty feeling from lack of engagement with real human emotion."
99,"Synecdoche, New York",8,13 November 2008,We are all the STAR of our own play,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sure I have struggled to write film comments for a day or two after seeing other movies. And yes, I have seen many films that were left wide open to interpretation, or even purposefully confusing. This is the first time I have waited nearly a week and still felt overwhelmed by what I saw.Charlie Kaufman is an astounding screenwriter. His stories include ""Eternal Sunshine"", ""Being John Malkovich"" and my favorite, ""Adaptation"". The man is brilliant at exploring and exposing the unexplainable human mind. Here, for the first time, he takes on the added duty of director.Synecdoche defined means a part for the whole. This applies to so many pieces of this Kaufman puzzle ... the most obvious being the actual scale model of a section of NYC. But much more importantly, we are provided bits of a person's life and come away with an understanding of the whole. To paraphrase, Kaufman tells us we are each the stars of our play/life. None of us see ourselves as supporting characters. We actually cast the role of the extras through our friends, neighbors, co-workers and lovers. Yet, we remain the star of the show.Make no mistake. This film is complex, intricate and comes at you from all angles with multiple levels and story lines. As a viewer, you must commit and work very hard to keep up. It won't be for everyone, but it is incredibly rewarding for those who invest. This is quite simply a story about life and people ... it is a story about you ... or me. We try to live our dream but no matter our intentions, the impact of others is what makes a life what it is.I will see this one at least a couple of more times and I can't wait to pick up more of what Mr. Kaufman has offered. One negative is that I would have preferred a separate director. I am a firm believer that Mr. Kaufman's work is more accessible if it is interpreted by another artist. The writer prevented the director from making a few revisions and edits. Just a minor quibble. I can't say much about the acting other than it is purely first class throughout. PS Hoffman, Sarah Morton and Catherine Keener are downright amazing and the supporting cast of Tom Noonan, Diane Wiest, Emily Watson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michelle Williams and Hope Davis are top notch.Just remember ... ""you are not special""."
100,"Synecdoche, New York",8,6 January 2010,Valuable in Ways,"This is what I took from the film... It's about artistic pursuits and artistic endeavours, how they are really just re-imagining, trying to find ever new ways to express what you, yourself, are feeling inside. Certain features also suggested that perhaps Kaufman was trying to say that why we become caught up in our art, and new art springs from it, we become so removed from life that ultimately everything in the world seems dreary and dead. With good acting throughout, it tries to cover in film form a lot of the tropes of Finnegans Wake, an open critique of modernism and pretension and a warning against the dangers of over indulging artists as if their production was the point of life. Because, as this film tries to show, art if a representation of life, that is less intense, emotionally, than the real thing. If we get lost in the art, if real life is lost, emotions become meaningless, they're just reactions, without depth or worth."
101,"Synecdoche, New York",3,15 September 2009,Only for Charlie Kaufman fans,"I don't like Charlie Kaufman films. I've tried them all and I always walk out feeling as though I've just watched someone, clearly intelligent, put a story together in such away as to make everything seem off and strange for no other reason than it will make him look more intelligent. That said as Charlie Kaufman movies go this isn't bad, it just never amounts to very much. The plot has a Theater director who is dying rushing to complete his dream theater project set in a life size version of New York City. Its a film about people and identity as characters play other characters and you have to sort out what is and is not real. I kind of see what Kaufman was getting at, but at the same time it didn't strike me as much of anything. Actually I had to watch this twice since the first time I walked out 25 minutes on to do something else and became completely distracted by something away from the TV. When I came back three hours later I realized that UI had walked out on the film. Only a sniggling desire to see how it came out resulted in my watching it to the end. It wasn't bad, but I didn't really need to see it the second time (or the first for that matter) and I've now found myself with a nifty coaster for my drinks. If you like Kaufman movies more power to you everyone else look elsewhere."
102,"Synecdoche, New York",,9 September 2009,art that makes you feel,"Caden Cotard (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is a playwright and family man lost in the sea of his life. In a sense his life is spiraling out of control: he begins to suffer numerous obscure physical ailments; he is tempted by the flirtations of a girl who works at his theater (Samantha Morton); his dissonant marriage to a talented artist (Catherine Keener) turns into a separation that eventually becomes a continental exile; his young daughter is tattooed over a large portion of her body, becomes the muse of a pedophile (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and is deceived (quite graphically) to think that her father abandoned her to pursue homosexual liaisons; and from there the story of Synecdoche, New York becomes exponentially more tragic, complicated and absurd. In the end, Caden is literally caught up in a cataclysmic global apocalypse. But believe it or not, none of this is especially significant to the story. The plot itself exists as a parable, and like all films written by Charlie Kaufman it is awash with symbolism, lunacy, and sorrow.In the midst of all these devastating events, Caden is bestowed a MacArthur Fellowship, which is a large monetary grant dispensed over a period of years for people in any field who show enormous ability and potential. With that funding he assembles a cast and crew in a huge Manhattan warehouse and creates a theatre program that imitates every detail of his life. Stacked compartmentalized sets are built for the play as analogues for his apartment, the street, the city, the real world, and then other sets are made to imitate those sets within sets within sets, etc. He casts an actor as himself, then another as himself directing himself, and others as himself directing himself directing himself and so on. You get the point. He also casts multiple actors for the roles other people have in his life. There is no way to distinguish between the relationships in his real life and the play, because everything is real life, and everything is the play, and he has no idea how to complete either. He hires a cleaning lady as his replacement director and takes on her former job himself, thus not only being merely a character within his play, but actually becoming an actor portraying the life of a role within the play within his life. As the aforementioned apocalypse ensues, bodies are strewn across the bleak desolate landscape of (the world? the play?) and Caden, now infirm, becomes more and more isolated and withdrawn from the process of (life? art?) until he is taking direction on his deathbed from a voice in his ear. Simultaneously, this film is life as an art form and art as a form of life, each carried out ad infinitum.Anyone who has seen anything written by Charlie Kaufman will be familiar with such themes, however I don't think I have ever observed within any other work of fiction such intense sadness as Caden's forty year journey across the last half of his life. The rose petals on his daughter's tattoo wither and fall from her body as she dies cursing him. The woman he has loved for over thirty years dies of smoke inhalation the same night they finally consummate their relationship because she lived for the same amount of time in a perpetually burning house. These mythic elements probably seem bizarre or baroque to most people, but they succeed within the film because Kaufman as writer/director/producer has created an incomparably beautiful and grotesque work of art that above all makes you feel.Most people often use deficient words like ""brilliant"" or ""masterpiece"" to describe great films, and I believe that is because we are too dim to articulate anything substantive about what a film means to us on a deeply personal level. All we dullards are aware of is that we have been moved, and that the mechanism of that movement is totally beyond our stupid, grasping comprehension.Synecdoche, New York is definitely a great film. It contains the best work of all people involved in its making. And although it is great for many reasons, none of the ones I am able to write intelligently about are what actually makes this film what it is. All I can say is that it is great simply because it is, and it means something to me. On the other hand, what the film means is hard to say...I guess it depends on how you feel, or if you can feel at all."
103,"Synecdoche, New York",,30 April 2009,Dazzling and Frustrating,"Charlie Kaufman's film is, like his other scripts (He directed this one as well), full of amazing ideas that, in the end, never quite come together to form a completely successful FILM. In most of the previous adaptations of his scripts (ADAPTATION, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND, ETERNAL SUNSHINE etc) the first half of the film leads to exalted expectations as the concepts are so daring and original, only to be let down by the second halves. With SYNECDOCHE it's a bit of the reverse as the 2nd half of the film is more cohesive than the first.The films are all worthy and successful, just not up to what the premise(s) promise. There's always a Down The Rabbit Hole element to Kaufman's writing where his imagination always gets the better of him. Admirers of his work willingly go along for the ride, but they always strike me as too clever for its own good. And, definitely 'too clever' for the good of the work as a whole.SYNECDOCHE has the added 'problem' that there isn't a second voice in the form of a Director to reign in Kaufman's imagination. So, here we get the lead character's New York daughter turn into a nude German tattoo model. Creative? Yes, but what's the point? (Yes, yes, I know, in part it's symbolic of the character's increasing alienation from his family and his inability to cope with his daughter's maturation etc etc.). The point is, that it's an arbitrary image. The daughter could have morphed into a Spanish Flamenco dancer or an Arab Harem women with little or no difference.Compare Philip Seymour Hoffman's Caden character's inner artistic struggle with that of Marcello Mastroianni's in 8 1/2. Fellini (and his writers such as Tullio Pinelli) were just as creative as Kaufman, but, in 8 1/2 no matter how outlandish and colorful the dreams, visions and memories of Guido were, you never lost sense of the character. In SYNECDOCHE, Caden often becomes a sideshow in his own story (yes, I know that is part of the point).Until Kaufman can dial down his 'imagination' - or, works with a collaborator with a tight tight reign - his films will continue to both dazzle and frustrate."
104,"Synecdoche, New York",6,11 March 2009,The story of a man's last moments of life.,"First off, Hoffman is brilliant. This is real acting; not requiring special F/X to make one a star, and even though for 99% of this movie I was going HUH?, every scene he was in was great. In an interview he basically tells us what the story is about, but you can tell that either he really quite does not know, or he is not supposed to tell. Keener, as usual, is superb as well. Like so few actors, she can say more with a facial expression than an entire page of dialogue. I had to read the blogs about the movie to try and figure out what was going on, and from what I can tell, not too many people could either. The issue that this is Ellen's story totally eludes me, since 1) she does not enter into the story until nearly the end of the picture, and 2) Hoffman's interview. As I was thinking of this movie, and boy will this movie get you thinking if you're the type to mull over a movie, and drifting off to sleep I think I came up with what this movie is about. It is about Caden, but it is the moment before he dies. Know that saying that when you die your life flashes before your eyes? How about when you die your future flashes before your eyes? But in this case some of Caden's past is there as well as that leads us into his final thoughts of what the future would be like. That's how we know he's an Uber hypochondriac, and that his marriage is not going well. This then explains all those weird scenes (the house always on fire, the play that takes 40 years to do, though never gets done, etc.). This also explains the time on the clock(s). Even if you never figure out what is going on, watching Hoffman is worth the time invested."
105,"Synecdoche, New York",8,11 March 2009,"Charlie Kaufman Shows us why ""all the world's a stage""","I just finally got around to seeing Synecdoche, New York and like the complexity of the film, I am filled with a myriad of emotions and ways to express myself which include; beautiful, poignant, boring at times, self indulgent, philosophical, touching, comedic, tragic and lastly sorrow. Like life itself This is the directorial debut of the famed eccentric writer Charlie Kaufman (of Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine...and Adaptation fame). He also wrote this vastly complex character drama of the life of a theater director Caden Cortard, Philip Seymour Hoffman (in another amazing performance) living and working in Schenectady, NY, who at the age of 40 is married with a child, his wife leaves him, taking his only child and with this, he is given the opportunity to create a work of art, which he takes on with full force and it becomes the all consuming piece of his life, which in turn becomes a reflection of his actual life. The film becomes a film, within a film, within a film and becomes even more convoluted and complex as it evolves. I do not want to expound more upon that any further, as it is a piece that needs to be experienced.The incredible ensemble cast also features, Samantha Morton, Catherine Keener, Michelle Williams, Tom Noonan, Emily Watson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Dianne Wiest. No part is thrown away, every performance is visceral and truthful and I really got a sense that everyone knew how they felt about their particular characters and what that meant to them. All in all there are over 80 speaking roles. As with other Kaufman works, the hero is a sullen, depressive who cannot seem to enjoy himself and he gets in his own way. His characters remind me of Woody Allen's characters, just without the laughs. However, there is a very tragicomic scene between Caden and his daughter, that is hysterical in all the wrong ways. It was brilliantly written. The character of Caden is a mess, who throughout the film thinks he is dying as he juggles his life, work and the many women who he loves. We are shown 50 years of his life and the way Kaufman goes through his 50 years, time is fluid and if you are not careful, you will miss many clues. I know I did and will have to see it a again to catch them all. And like many of Kaufman's stories, I found myself getting frustrated as it was moving along, yet as it neared its completion I recognized the genius and can only doff my cap to another profound and highly inventive story by one of the finest in the business today. Indeed Shakespeare was right when he said ""All the world's a stage and we are merely players."" Charlie Kaufman deftly shows us why."
106,"Synecdoche, New York",10,7 March 2017,A Must Watch!,"Charlie Kaufman knocks this one out of the park! However given his track record of such master works as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Adaptation, and Being John Malkivch, this is although not a surprise by any means is probably his best film yet!Synecdoche, New York is a prime example of the power of film. What I mean by this is the Synecdoche, New York (like Kaufmann other works) is not so much a dumb fun blockbuster as it is an interpretive piece of art that begs to be analized. To explain the plot of the film would be an injustice in it of its own right as this film is meant to be what you the viewer sees it as. This is a film that brings several ideas to the table that force you to think of your life in hind sight as well as question your thinking of death. The many themes in the film leave behind sutilties within that beg for interpretation.To say anything else would be to tell you to much. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The themes of life and death have given me hours of contemplation. This is not just a movie, but a complex series of events that create a magnificent art piece.10/10"
107,"Synecdoche, New York",10,10 October 2016,Best Film of All Time,"Upon a single viewing, that is probably not the case.The reason I say this is the best movie ever is because every time I watch this, it feels like a different movie. I don't know if any other movie conveys practically every emotion of what it's like to be alive better than this one. Upon every viewing, I find myself relating to different stages of Caden more. Some of it has to do with growing older. Some of it has to do with love. With work. With friends. With strangers. It has everything, and the way Kaufman presents it is genius. He can't say everything about life because that would take too long. However, he can stuff as many visual metaphors into any given scene so you notice something different each time you watch it. 10/10 Great acting, cinematography, directing, writing."
108,"Synecdoche, New York",10,28 August 2016,"""All the worlds a stage""","This dark comedy is an exploration into the meaning of a life. A director receives an inexhaustible grant to produce a play. The play he produces is an interpretation of life as he experiences it. As his own life begins to fall apart and his health fails and the play grows in size and complexity the lines between reality and fiction disappear. This is a beautiful film and if you persist past the abstractions the odd characters and facts of his strange world without being too unsettled you will be rewarded with a piece that has a lot to say about the futility of life and its subsequent beauty. As a comedy it is similar to ""the nines"", ""being john malkovich"", ""eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" and ""punch drunk love"". This film contains outstanding performances from all, it is beautifully written and will stand the test of time."
109,"Synecdoche, New York",8,5 February 2016,"Depressing, Weird, but Good","This is the type of movie most people will absolutely love or hate. I personally thought this was a great idea that was done pretty well. The beginning is pretty boring as all the characters are introduced and developed. Phillip Seymour Hoffman really kept my interest through the beginning, as he is absolutely brilliant. I am shocked he didn't get more recognition when this came out. I thought this was his best performance, even better than his Oscar win in Capote. The movie is basically about a stage director who has his life fall apart around him as he makes a play that follows his life. He is telling his story through the stage and is directing how his life has gone. Very fascinating idea to say the least. The visuals were great as the crew in the movie builds a model of New York which is used as the stage for the play. Using this stage to play out the ""play within the movie"" made for a fascinating watch.The director did a good job with Synecdoche, New York but was boring at times. The beginning was especially tedious. The character development took a little too long and some of it was unnecessary as it lost my interest. I think the movie could have been a little shorter as parts just didn't add to the fascinating idea at hand.Overall Synecdoche, New York is a good movie that could have been great. Hoffman was the bright light that keeps your attention while the story has time to come out. It is definitely worth a watch. 7/10"
110,"Synecdoche, New York",7,5 July 2015,"An intelligent, yet imperfect art film","This is my first review on IMDb. I don't review movies, but I think that there is a lot that needs to said about this art film. I thought that Synecdoche, New York is intelligent and has a lot of good messages, but it does have its flaws and problems. I will also explain my interpretation of the film. Keep in mind that this my personal opinion both about how good the movie is and about the interpretation.First of all, I think Charlie Kaufman did a great job with the screenplay. He proved himself to be a great writer in earlier movies such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. His directing is also good, as shown by the great performances in the cast, especially from Philip Seymour Hoffman. Also, it has a good message that hasn't really been explored in many movies. I will get into that later in my analysis. Synecdoche also has its humorous moments, especially with his therapist and with the complexity of his theatrical production. The editing was somewhat impressive, but I think that the cinematography and the music were nothing special.My main issues of this film were with the story. I wasn't that interested in the story and I didn't find myself really caring about the characters. I did say that the directing was good, but it wasn't great. It also had some pacing issues, and the movie didn't have a good flow. I thought that this movie was also too long. There were some characters, relationships, and messages that I felt were unnecessary. For example, Claire and Maria were unnecessary characters, and Caden's relationship with Tammy was unnecessary. But in my opinion, the biggest part of the movie that it didn't need was the introduction of Ellen. It was very abrupt and it didn't bring anything new to the movie. So I did not like the ending.The main theme of this movie is the fear of death. The main character Caden is depressed and very afraid of dying. He talks to his therapist about it, he always goes straight to the obituaries when he gets the newspaper, and he always thinks of it when he gets various health problems throughout the movie. Also, death seems to happen all around him (with 5 funerals in the film not including the death of his daughter), but it never happens to him until the end of the movie. This is in contrast with the two women that he loved. His first wife also seemed depressed, but she never really cared about health problems and dying. Hazel was sort of the same. She was bright and lively, much like her burning house on a dull street, and wanted to have fun. In my interpretation, Kaufman is saying that you shouldn't be so scared of dying because you will live a sad life, but don't be completely ignorant of it either, since it could (figuratively) end up killing you (like the fumes of the fire did to hazel).I give the movie a seven out of ten. This rating probably isn't surprising, since that movie has mixed reviews. I might like it more after repeated viewings. As a whole, Synecdoche is like similar art film Birdman, but with as many story problems as Sunshine."
111,"Synecdoche, New York",9,3 October 2014,"""Summary"" on title page is misleading. Expect a series of sad, surreal vignettes rather than a typical story.","Finally watched it. This (great) movie deals with loss, aging, and death. It does so in an extremely psychedelic way. Malkovich, Sunshine, and Adaptation are similar, but Synecdoche is actually the most depressing, the saddest, yet the most brutally honest of these. Kaufman faces the main human fears and pain head-on.The aforementioned summary tells you about a director who is making a play and dealing with women, so you come in expecting a story-driven film. Synecdoche is all about creating a metapsychological experience. The events in and of themselves aren't important - their role is to convey certain universal feelings and conditions. The movie gradually builds up the surreal component, until you are gliding along a series of scenes and characters that are meant to SPEAK TO YOU THROUGH PURE EMOTION. You end up in a state where the on-screen events make no logical sense, but make perfect, and beautiful, if hard and painful, sense emotional.This is a brilliant work. Until you dare face the facts of aging and death, you'll never be able to do anything about it. This movie has the heart to make the viewer look those facts in the (cloudy, teary, frightened) eye.9/10."
112,"Synecdoche, New York",8,22 August 2014,Mind-bogglingly fantastic,"As a film watcher, I always have a sort of ritual I follow for choosing and then watching movies. The step that proceeds right after the movie, is looking up other people's opinions and critics on them, often broadening my own analysis of the movie. And that's what I love about films: they give you something to seek, a kind of objective yet very personal truth about it. This movie doesn't give you that ""truth"", yet it does so in an extremely elegant, yet rough around the edges, manner. And you know what? This film actually made me not care about the truth, but rather about the maze that leads to it. Going through not only an amazing cast, but also a beautiful script, Kauffman leads us through the valley of his own mind. But he guides not by talking and explaining, but solely by images: the burning house, the never-ending warehouse, the role-switching, the seeming civil war going on in that world, and even some green poo, and even the surrealism surrounding the final scene; all carefully placed and shown as a sort of gallery, it makes for a great ride, one that will definitely leave you thinking how beautiful human feelings are."
113,"Synecdoche, New York",,2 November 2013,A singular and entirely unique viewing experience.,"I'm not sure how I feel about this movie. I couldn't tell you if it was entertaining or enjoyable. I can't deconstruct its plot, criticize its direction, or judge its approach. It's hard for me to even articulate my reaction to the film, let alone critique it. So why are there 9 stars attached to this review?If nothing else, I strongly feel that this movie is singular, unique, unlike anything that has been made, and something that can never be remade. In turn, the experience of watching this film is singular, unique, unlike anything that may have been experienced before, and something that can never be replicated. This film could've only been made by this writer/director, at this time in his career, and at this stage in his artistic pursuits. It is wholly his vision; pure, unadulterated, and put to film. Isn't that what true art really is? I feel that the witnessing true art occurs when you experience another's creation that you know is above you. In other words, you know you couldn't have possibly created yourself, and that it probably couldn't have been created by anyone other than the creator himself. It's the experience of seeing something that you can't quite fully wrap your head around when you can't quite conceive of the thought processes of the person who brought it into existence. So you simply watch, almost in a state of awe, and experience the film exactly how it is, and how it was meant to be.Maybe with future viewings I can sort out the minor details like if I was ""entertained"" or if this movie was well made, paced, and constructed by the standards of modern cinema. But these details ultimately don't matter. All that matters is that this film provided me a unique viewing experience one that I have never quite experienced before and one that I don't think I'll ever quite experience again. And it's something I wouldn't trade and certainly won't soon forget."
114,"Synecdoche, New York",8,25 March 2013,Confusing message about the meaning of life,"After hits on earlier films did not expect that Kaufman has so much imagination to create another film that viewers will simply tuck in the film so that the viewer will regret film has an ending. I was wrong.Kaufman throws us another masterpiece that you must look at a few more times to fully understand. At the beginning looks like a movie about a man who has a crisis in marriage, although successful in business and can not promise anything, and during the closing credits seem to let the movie viewer play and watch movie again or to see when the next screening of this film is.Brilliant Hoffman, brilliant directing, original story, the film that honestly recommend it to anyone, although I am aware that not everyone will understand it."
115,"Synecdoche, New York",7,13 August 2012,This will be weird,"Give the writer of Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Adaptation. a chance to both write AND direct a movie? Well, this is going to be, shall we say, different. Charlie Kaufman specializes in weird, trippy mind-benders. In his previous films he benefited from having directors who could rein his scripts in a bit and make some sense of things. In Synecdoche, New York Kaufman is on his own and things get away from him a bit. For as weird as his earlier films may have been there was still coherence in them. In this case when writer Kaufman sees his film go off the deep end director Kaufman isn't able to pull it back. Still an interesting film though. It's incredibly ambitious stuff and enough of it works to forgive the film for by the end trailing off into a confusing haze.The film tells the story of Caden Cotard, a small town New York theater director whose life is falling apart around him. His wife really has no use for him and soon takes off for Germany with the couple's young daughter. Left behind Caden has a disastrous relationship with the woman who mans the box office at his theater. After that he moves on to a disastrous relationship with an actress in his play. Eventually things come back around to that first woman. That still doesn't work. All the while Caden suffers from bizarre physical ailments, his body failing him. And it becomes pretty clear his mind is failing him too. Because when he gets a chance to go to New York City to put on a play there...well, let's just say things get as weird as weird can be.Up to the point Caden leaves for the big city the film has been, by Kaufman standards, rather normal. OK, time seems to move in strange fashion and there's a house which is perpetually on fire. But mostly it's a straightforward tale of Caden hitting rock bottom. Then Kaufman goes all meta on us. The theater company takes up residence in a giant warehouse in which Caden essentially directs them to just go about their lives. His play will be their lives, a celebration of the mundane. But the play grows larger. And larger. And larger. And weirder. And it is never finished. Years go by. Then decades. The line between the world of the play and the real world is blurred. Can we tell what is real anymore? It seems Caden can't. Eventually an actor is hired to play Caden. Does this then require an actor playing the actor playing Caden? There's a play within the play. A warehouse within the warehouse. How many levels deep does this go? Can Caden make any sense of this? Can Kaufman? Can we?To say this all gets a bit messy is an understatement. Relationships become tangled as real people interact with actors playing those real people. For example the actor playing Caden falls for the woman with whom Caden way back when had that first disastrous relationship, Hazel. This revives Caden's feelings for Hazel. But wait, the real Hazel or the actress playing Hazel? And more and more people get added to the play, which by now having grown to monstrous proportions, is obviously never going to be done. It's not a play anymore, it's life. Or is it? Because life is real and this, well this is too bizarre to be real. Will it all finally be neatly explained? No it will not. Kaufman never really ties it together. It's a film which makes you think, which is certainly not a bad thing. But all the thought and effort and attention the audience puts into it is in the end not really rewarded. The film fizzles out. When you look back at it you can't help but think it was too long, too slowly paced. By the time the end comes the drama has up and left. It's a film which was smart and so ambitious but probably too ambitious for its own good. It needed to be reined in a bit to make it really work. Give credit to Philip Seymour Hoffman for a tremendous performance in the incredibly challenging role of Caden. Samantha Morton is fabulous as well in the critical role of Hazel and a wide collection of supporting players round out what is an excellent cast. But no matter how good the performers are if you can't make heads or tails of the story you've got a problem. However flawed that it may be Synecdoche, New York is compelling though. Kaufman aimed big. Really, really big. And he missed the mark by a bit. But what he produced is still smart and thought-provoking even if utterly confusing and somewhat nonsensical. You can see what Kaufman was going for. The fact he didn't quite pull it off doesn't mean he didn't produce a worthwhile film."
116,"Synecdoche, New York",7,14 February 2011,Cotard delusion,"Cotard delusion, also known as Cotard syndrome, is a rare neuropsychiatric disorder in which a person believes, wrongly, they are dead. In many ways people suffering from this strange disease act can look at themselves in a mirror imagining they are a living corpse. This complicated condition is also known as Walking Corpse Syndrome, something that Charlie Kaufman, the creator of 'Synecdoche, New York' probably got his inspiration for this complex film that most people will dismiss as a pretentious attempt for a film. Mr. Kaufman, one of the cleverest men working in the American cinema today, has created a variation on the theme that must have attracted his vivid imagination, translating it into cinematic form.Granted, it is not an easy film to sit through. Most people suggest watching the film more than once before the viewer can make a real assessment at the images that unfold on the screen. No one really knows what is happening to Caden Cotard, a theater director from Schenectedy, New York, in the process of staging his own version of Arthur Miller's masterpiece ""Death of a Salesman"" for a local production. In contrast with the traditional presentation of the play, Caden insists to cast the parts with younger actors, which in his mind makes more sense.Life at home is not exactly a happy one. Caden is married to Adele Lack, a painter of erotic art that works on minimal canvas that are carefully painted using special goggles. They have a young daughter, Olive, who suffers from an unknown condition, excreting green feces. Their married life begins to deteriorate when Caden begins noticing different health problems that baffle the doctors he consults. Every one he sees has a different opinion.After Adele decamps for an exhibit of her work in Berlin, Caden follows, but he encounters her rejection; she wants nothing to do with him, sending her good friend, Maria, to explain her position. When Caden gets back home, he wants to move his theatrical hit to Manhattan. He is given a big warehouse-like space in which to set the play, but it is at this time he gets the idea of involving the company into an epic production, one that will consume the better part of his life, never going anywhere. After all, it is his own life that plays center stage, involving actors that will stand for the real people in Caden Cotard's life.The film is not exactly for everyone, but just because of the strength of the talented players Mr. Kaufman was able to get, it is worth a look by anyone that enjoys films. It will certainly baffle a lot of viewers, but it will reward audiences that want to take a trip guided by the hand of the director. At the center of the film is an amazing portrayal of Caden Cotared by Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of our best actors, bar none. He gives one of the best performances of his career as the complex man suffering from a strange malady. Michelle Williams, Samantha Morton, Catherine Keener, Dianne Wiest, Tom Noonan, Emily Watson, do excellent work. The incredible Hope Davis shines as Madeleine Gravis, the psychiatrist treating the mind of Cotard, while pushing her own overpriced books in the process.As of the moment we write this comment, it appears Mr. Kaufman is not working on anything new, or has written more for the cinema. A loss for serious film goers."
117,"Synecdoche, New York",6,25 June 2010,Truman's show,"Charlie Kaufman's directorial début is as ambitious and odd as would expect from the writer of 'Being John Malkovich'. A playwright rehearses a play about his own life; as the rehearsals go on for ever longer, so the play becomes increasingly a play about it's own rehearsal. It's sort of like 'The Truman Show' only directed by Truman - and full of brilliant low key humour, examples of stunningly cruel (yet understated) human behaviour and random strangeness. Sometimes a sly detail truly makes you gasp - and yet, to make such a self-referential joke as a length of well over two hours is not so funny, and the piece could easily be slammed as self-indulgent and unfocused. For all Kaufman's brilliance, the story is curiously lacking in driving energy, Philip Seymour Hoffman (in the lead role) effectively believes in the imminence of his own death at the start of the film and there he is at the end, 50-odd screen years later and still tediously alive and depressed. There are real flickerings of talent in here; but also signs of a talent overindulged, that has lost interest in structure, narrative or entertainment in favour of an endless loop of repeated mumbles. It's a fascinating failure, but definitely not quite a success."
118,"Synecdoche, New York",7,21 June 2009,Veering close to the end.,"Multiple selves and multiple lives mirrored in the complexity of and constructed by an intense, suffocating interiority of an alternative but somehow parallel world that decays on the outside as our hero decays on the inside. It falls apart and is reconstructed as does he. He constructs new selves at a pace that mirrors ageing and life. It is painful, gentle, prodding and probing. The 'out of control' selves who change and challenge his perception of self, who reveal his inner deceptions and lay them in an outer but protected domain are interesting. The fact that his public do not see but we do is equally interesting as a concept but no more. It challenges and chases your thoughts but sometimes it chases them to the bar, the fridge or the exit. It is too damn long and tortured. 20 minutes needed editing out. The metaphor and in the end, the ultimate synecdoche did not need such over blowing to waft past effectively. Take a cushion, you will need it.."
119,"Synecdoche, New York",,3 June 2009,An interesting movie from the twisted mind of Charlie Kaufman.,"What an unusual movie. I watched it alone on DVD because I know my wife simply does not enjoy this kind of movie. She didn't even enjoy ""Being John Malkovich"" even though that one has a story that is pretty easy to follow.This movie, ""Synecdoche, NY"", has a story that is pretty well impossible to follow. Or, it has a story that is very apparent ... what real life feels like, a sort of mixture of reality and dreams, and impossible to separate the two. It is a play on its setting, Schenectady, NY, which is pronounced almost like ""Synecdoche."" The central figure is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Caden Cotard, a director of stage productions, around 40. He is a family man but we see that the ""honeymoon"" has been over for a while. He gets a very impressive grant, often termed the ""genius grant"", and decides that he must do something important, something very lasting. So he begins to write a script and to build a set and eventually hires hundreds of actors, all to mirror real life. But now ""real life"" has a writer and director, so he has to write them in, and then extend that concept for several layers and you get what amounts to a never ending development. And when you consider it, ""life"" is like that.The story spans 40 to 50 years as Caden develops his stage production but never completes it. His set has become a replica of New York City inside a large warehouse, which by necessity has a replica of the warehouse inside it! A pretty strange story.I enjoyed it at the level of entertainment, and the unusual manner in which Kaufman develops the story. What is it all about? Only Kaufman can answer that, although the critic Ebert has a pretty good explanation of what he thinks it is.Charlie Kaufman, writer of ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" This was his first effort at directing."
120,"Synecdoche, New York",8,6 April 2009,"A brave, interesting, yet flawed film","A brave, interesting, even scary film that I found slightly faltered underneath the weight of its grandiose ideas. While Kauffmans pondering on love, death, loneliness, and the overarching purpose of life were at times startlingly raw and beautiful in their presentation, the films often cryptic main storyline dragged throughout. While I found every scene was necessary, some were not fully developed or prolonged considerably, affecting the overall impact of the film. Not to say that there aren't many many truly brilliant, almost jaw-dropping moments of celluloid here. Hoffman and the entire supporting cast are wonderful in their roles, and the bulk of the dialogue, especially the last monologue, was affecting in how deeply it cuts into our basic human needs and desires. It was fascinating seeing the faux New York grow throughout the film, eventually becoming a truly alternative reality for the protagonist was surreal. In summary, though, I found it to be a challenging film that really wants to get at the core of how we all strive to find/create something truly meaningful out of life that defines our short time here, yet most never find it. In the end, we should live in every moment, and not have any regrets at the end. Its a challenging, mind-bending love/hate film that portrays the joyful, lonely, bleak, and uplifting moments of human existence in all its complex simplicity."
121,"Synecdoche, New York",,22 December 2008,The most dangerous film of the year,"This is a film about Caden Cotard. Caden has mounting health problems and serious relationship problems. Caden gets a letter to enable the funds to craft as big a production as they want. Caden then finds a massive warehouse and, with the group of people who are involved, they build a full-scale model of New York. Then, inside that model, they build the same warehouse in order to build a model of New York inside that. Then inside the second model they build the warehouse that the original model is located in and then build a model of New York inside of that one and so-on and so-on. Basically, it's like one of those Russian dolls where you keep taking the top off and it gets smaller and smaller but there still exists another inside of the one that is much bigger. Or, if you put a mirror in front of another mirror to create an everlasting eternity of infinite mirrors inside mirrors that continuously get smaller and smaller and smaller but continue to exist despite the ones further down being invincible to the naked eye. Anyway, the film's concepts are grounded on the basis of those sorts of circumstances and situations. However, this is all part of Caden's directorial vision of a stage-play that keeps growing larger and larger but will likely never be fully realized. This process will go on for 40 years, during which many many people will die, either form old age or from suicide or from some other means. This film has been growing more and more in my mind each passing day. I only saw it a few days ago, but it's already beginning to affect my life. The problem I have is trying to figure out whether or not it is affecting me in a good way or a bad way. This is a film that has somehow affected my subconscious train of thought in some weird way. It has struck a cord. It has pinched a nerve. In some weird way, this film makes more sense than any other film ever made. Watching this film was like watching the worst nightmare anyone could ever have. There is something profoundly basic about this film. There are moments of incredible sadness, brilliant humor, and genuine horror, and yet these moments will be completely different to all who watch it. Some will laugh hard at scenes that many other people find incredibly heart-wrenching. This film goes from one scene to another with layer upon layer of genuine seriousness inside of ideas that, in theory, are quite satirical. At the base of all of this is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Caden. Caden takes more physical and emotional abuse than any normal human being could ever take. However, the characters who play Caden and the many women that surround Caden are played by separate actors inside of the stage-play and take on many different character choices and arcs, but as the real life people die, it becomes clear that the structure of the idea surrounding the character of Caden, in the play, will not be superficially sound and solid enough for it to work on a genuine level. Caden wants to create something real, but as a result the self-discovery process becomes an unexpectedly rocky road. I know that the film is saying that death is scary, but to get deeper would require more than one viewing. I need to see this movie again. I'm dying to. I'm going to have to own it when it comes out because I feel that this film could teach me something about myself that I don't yet know. I felt like this film may have partly been about me, and I think that Charlie Kaufman, the writer and director of Synecdoche, New York may be a mad genius and may have helped me rediscover my mad genius through this film alone."
122,"Synecdoche, New York",1,30 April 2014,My life is sad now,"This is a film that tries hard to be hard, emotional and 'a real portrayal of human lives' but it is instead the most pretentious, dull, life-destroyingly depressing 2 and ½ hours of film ever made. In the final dragging 40 minutes it tries to make out that it was a planned and beautiful conclusion to a horrible deathly dull life, but in reality it was just the same brain-melting tedium with an emotional soundtrack on repeat. Sadly, I can only guess that that is why half the people reviewing on here think the film must have been brilliant: that an emotional background sound and a few deep-sounding but ultimately pointless speeches convinced people that the boredom they sat through for the last 2 ½ hours was worth it. If you really want to watch this film, search the vicar speech, which is a 4 minute speech about how depressing life is; it sounds like no more than a half-planned, life-hating poem, yet this is by far the best section of the film.This has been the worst film of my life and I feel like I can't bring myself to watch another film again because of it. But I know a lot of you will watch this anyway and weigh up the odds and say ""it can't be that bad"". I am truly sorry for you."
123,"Synecdoche, New York",8,17 November 2008,Synechdoce answers here!!!,"Maybe I'm pretentious, but I feel that I'm one of the only people who understood this film. Synecdoche. Half overwrought forced symbolism and metaphor, half ultimate existential truth. I feel that many of the critiques of this film barely scratch the surface of what Kaufman was getting at because the viewers anchored themselves into the VISUAL ride that had no straight forward through line and was therefore overwhelmingly random and ultimately frustrating; but the story isn't in the visual, it's in the spiritual, and it conferred every truth about the human experience. ""Show don't tell"" : the filmmakers axiom. Maybe the film was self indulgent, but I dare say it was rightly so and HAD to be because the subject matter so all encompassing that the only way to give it an interesting platform and avoid proselytizing was to visualize it to a bizarre extreme.Question 1. Hazel. Didn't she seem desperate to you? Like maybe she's one of those ticking biological clock women who leech onto any seemingly available man in an attempt to fulfill her woman's duty before time runs out. She lives in a burning house. I believe the burning house was a convention that represented time running out on her desire to have a family. Adele and Caden are an ""old"" couple. As we all know marriages grow cold despite genuine love still being present. Adele admitted in therapy that she imagined Caden dying because she wanted a new start. Later in the film I believe Hazel made the comment about us all being on our own and having to continue on our path in search of what ever fulfills us no matter what. Adel, having ended her course with Cotard as a wife owed it to herself to continue on her individual life path. I think Kaufman was saying that marriage is NOT the end all be all that we make it out to be. We don't stop changing, we don't stop yearning and needing to grow. Adele stayed true to herself and kept it moving. Good for her. I think Caden never got over Adele and was somewhere subconsciously hoping and preparing for her return, hence the upkeep of her apartment.With Olive it reminds me of a line of a John Meyer song called ""daughters"". the line goes : 'girls become lovers, who turn in to mothers"". Olive grew up, became aware of her body as all women do, and did with it what she wanted. As a father Caden will never stop seeing his little girl as his little girl, even as he watched her dance naked in a peep show booth covered with tattoos. A comment on general human perspective and how our cemented images of people resist change despite glaring truths before our eyes. There was also a scene where he mentions the tattoos to his new wife and she takes off her shirt revealing a huge back piece. What does he say? "" I've never even seen that before!"" That's because with our lovers as well as any person we're close to, we tend to see them as we want, rarely as they are. Hope Davis, the therapist, seems to have it all under control, seems to have surmounted the psychological and physical struggles us mere mortals endure, not so. She had the same sores on her feet as Cotard alluding to her grappling with the exact same problem. She is Cotard, she just knows how to play her ""part"" better than any of us and pretends to be above it all. I think her books reappear at the end as a reminder that none of us are above it, our exteriors vary but our inner worlds are the exact same. I think the ""real world"" ended after his wife left and he began dealing with his illnesses, that's when he began searching and grasping and all the events metaphoric of his emotional mental journey after that point.As far as the relationships between the characters used as standings for main characters and said main characters, I think it was a comment on how when we move on from one relationship we often seek a literal replacement for what we lost and end up dating someone remarkably similar to the person we just broke up with. Hence Hazel falling for Cotard's stand in."
124,"Synecdoche, New York",7,16 November 2008,"Interesting, but it doesn't work","It's not like Charlie Kaufman has written just great scripts in the past, with Human Nature and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, but I had hoped that, when directing his own script for the first time, he would be able to make the definitive Kaufmanesque artwork. Alas, maybe he needs the structure of another director to rein in his mad ideas. Or perhaps, like Human Nature and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Synecdoche, New York is just a misstep. It's not terrible or anything (and neither are his two other lesser films that I've already mentioned twice), but it just doesn't work. The movie involves a play director (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who gets a genius grant. Always having put on the plays of others, he now decides to write his own play, about his own, miserable life. Not just one part of his life, but his whole life, from birth to death, encompassing every daily event. Soon the play is about a director putting on a play about a director putting on a play. The idea is fascinating. Unfortunately, the execution is poor. Like Adaptation, Synecdoche comes from Charlie Kaufman's inner insecurities. This one is completely internal, and doesn't take place in any recognizable reality. There are bald symbols at every corner, like a house that is perpetually in flames. Kaufman rarely gives any real clues about these symbols, which leads to them being analyzed and then just dismissed as self-indulgence. Kaufman never gave me an in with the picture, so I just never cared about what was going on. And much of the time, Kaufman's sense of humor is lacking. Some of the more jokey material, like the arrogant, self-promoting psychologist played by Hope Davis, gets dropped as the film progresses, right about the time it's becoming pretty funny. I did start to like the movie better when it was dealing with the multi-layered universe Hoffman had put himself in. That mind-bending stuff is quite entertaining."
125,"Synecdoche, New York",1,1 April 2009,"Synecdoche, N.Y. 1/2* Winner of Weirdest Film Yet","I've seen some awful films in my years and this one is way up there. This is artistic brilliance? This is more like artistic nonsense.The 1/2* represents the fine performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman. This man never fails to amaze me. He could make a film wrapped around in toilet tissue and succeed.The problem with this film is that it is weird. Very weird.A man's wife leaves him and takes their 4 year old child to Berlin of all places. He searches for them but never finds them.In the meantime, Hoffman is a director. We find him directing ""Death of A Salesman."" What an appropriate play to be a director. Willie Loman would have gone faster had he seen Synedoche. Then, we see Hoffman directing an autobiographical play about his turbulent life. Hoffman, it is true, pulls out all the various emotional stops in his performance, but the film is over-wrought with preoccupation of illness, death, and general misery and we look into our inner psyche. (You need a psychiatrist for this one.)"
126,"Synecdoche, New York",10,14 April 2009,Extraordinary,"Charlie Kauffman deserves a Nobel Prize for this. Forget the Oscar. He's in a different league here.This is one of those movies that you cannot be ambivalent to unless you're sleepwalking... it has an unmistakable power to force you to think, feel, and process life differently than you're used to. This movie has power. Life as art, art as life, and all of the unknowns which dominate everything man does coupled to all the unrequited moments with their longings and hurts only serve as the matrix for this remarkable and beautiful film. I say ""'only' the matrix"" because beneath the trappings of the superficial are the endless invisible layers: the shadowings, and ""what-ifs"" that comprise the alternate universes within universes surrounding us, the Russian Doll withins the withins receding as fractal images each another within to itself that are the true grist for Kauffman here. This is a deeply introspective work. I can understand how those who are seeking only the eye candy of a fast-paced car chase would not get this movie. Likewise someone who is young and who has not yet experienced those longer currents of wistfulness that can only come with aging may not be able to fully get this movie. If there is one thing vital about aging, it is that richness of depth from long encounter with experience.As personal as this movie is, as it revolves around the protagonist and his relationships, Kauffman holds out that there is a tinge of madness to the introspective vision, and to the creative process. Both his character's name, and a name found on a mailbox are identified mental delusions: one, Cotard, named for a nihilistic sense of decay, one, Capgras, for a disturbing notion that all those near and dear have been replaced with substitutes who although they look the same and act the same are not the originals. Both of these delusional illnesses dominate plot in SNY. From the strange hypochondria he exhibits almost daily, to his psychosomatic manifestations, to his belief that he is losing autonomic functioning and must somehow through biofeedback training use his mind to take over bodily functions, to his concern with his bowels------emerges a portrait of a person extremely neurotically involved with their body, and all that can go wrong. In one scene he urinates and his urine is very dark brown, almost black. Did he imagine this?---or did it happen? We're never sure. All we know is that this is a person who is unsure of being alive on the planet, not comfortable with himself or anyone else. Kauffman lays bare the uncertainties of life as a knife reveals the tissue and blood within the body, and with all the concern one might have when no medical assistance is available for a serious injury. And under all this is that ultimate certainty that the bowels will stop working, the kidneys not filter properly, the cells of the body not replicate as once, and decay set in. His hypochondriac delusions are founded on reality . . . maybe not so delusional after all. And will others ultimately replace those we now know? The lover have a different face, different body? The doctor once fat and Caucasian become thin and Asian? This is how life moves. And Kauffman suggests to us that mental illness is maybe only a state of prescience, of time dislocated from the process of knowing. Everything about this movie has to do with perceptions being skewed toward ultimate uncertainty. Nothing stays the same, is reliable, or can be counted on to be quite as one remembers it or expects it to be based on prior experience, and final earthly wisdom remains just as uncertain. Strangely enough, I was reminded of Stanley Kubrick's 2001 and Keir Dullea's character toward the end, in the French Provincial setting --- I think, after many years, that scene finally makes some sense to me after watching ""Synecdoche, New York."" Just don't ask me to explain how.I love this movie. I believe that a separate award for Kauffman for this movie be given by the Film Industry: genius. It's that good."
127,"Synecdoche, New York",10,4 April 2009,Eternal Sunshine of Charlie Kaufman's Mind,"Charlie Kaufman is my hero. He has been without a doubt one of the best modern writers since the film Being John Malkovich (1999). Now, after his directing debut Synecdoche, New York (2008) which he made based on his own script, I believe that Kaufman has taken the unique position among the best, most creative, ambitious, visually interesting directors of our times. Synecdoche, New York is a fascinating film, deep and profound, dramatic and funny, sophisticated and innovative, complex yet clear. Kaufman was able to gather a dream cast of extremely talented intelligent actors and each of them gave a performance they should be proud of. As a matter of fact I did not expect anything less from the man behind Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). Before I watched the film I knew I would be confused, lost, maybe even infuriated sometimes but it is great to get lost in such incredibly complicated but outstanding work of Art with a capital A. Yes, of course Synecdoche, New York brings to mind the great movies of the past. Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors, Stardust Memory or Deconstructing Harry, which in turn reminds so much of Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries were the first I remember. I also think of Synecdoche as Fellini's 8 1/2 sans Nino Rota's music. So what? All artists come to the point when they have to explore the old but forever burning themes of the human existence on their own. What is life? What is its meaning? How unique every life is? How each of us, every single one is a main hero of our own story and how unique every story is? What is the purpose of Art? Why and how love dies? Is it possible to survive and forget it? Why are we given the short gift of life since we will be inevitable losing the game to the dealer that always wins? Why is our imagination so strong and limitless while our physical weakness is so humiliating and frustrating? All of these questions have been explored and meditated upon since the humankind exists but how original, ambitious, grandiose, profound, tragically optimistic and incredibly sad and sober the first film of Charlie Kaufman is. Bravo to Charlie  first and foremost  and to Philip, and Tom, and Catherine, and Samantha, and Emily, and Dianne, and Jennifer, and Michelle, and Hope, and everyone who have become the part of this mind-blowing cinematic and artistic event. My special thank you goes to Jon Brion, the author of original music for the film."
128,"Synecdoche, New York",10,2 April 2009,Review,"Brilliant. I don't even know where to start. Synecdoche is the craftiest, most sublime, and beautifully poignant movie possibly ever made. It leaves you with a very real sense of what it is to be human, at the same time stripping you of your fantasies and leaving you humbly alone to ponder on it all. The movie starts out in a mash of emotions and disconnectedness from any of the characters but yourself. Part of what is so brilliant about this movie is that you have no idea until almost the very end that you are literally a character in it and that only at that moment you have a clue as to what you've actually been watching. Right out of the gate you quite un-caringly find the main character Caden at the beginning of a confounding illness that threatens his life amidst his rather uninteresting and humiliating string of bad relationships with women. The man is definitively alone as he tries to make sense of his life. Writer, Director Charlie Kaufman works absolute magic as he twists what your watching into exactly what he wants you to feel. Just like Caden, at the beginning we don't care about anyone but our selves, you wonder why your even still watching it. When his first wife leaves for Germany with their daughter we feel the required amount of emotion to drag most of us through to it's end. The movie parallels not only life itself but your experiences watching it, Caden's life, the life of the film, the life of the piece Caden is ignorantly trying to create and your reactions to it. Kaufman plays with your attention, emotion, expectation, curiosity, and very humanity to bring you something akin to the biggest revelation of your life. What is all this human stuff about? What is it to grow old, lonely, degrading, having someone at it's end direct your life right to the point of death itself? It's not till the very end you grasp anything the movie is offering (of which I have left much out), yet when it happens it grips your very soul with a profoundness that has not been previously experienced as a result of any movie. Somehow depressing and consoling it stirs compassion and understanding for your fellow human in a depth not recognized before. F%$king brilliant."
129,"Synecdoche, New York",8,15 November 2008,A folly,"In this behemoth, this collection of characters in search of a story, hip screenwriter Charlie Kaufman delivers a directorial debut of enormous ambition. But while earlier writing-only efforts like 'Being John Malkovich,' 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,' 'Adaptation,' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' are brilliant provocations, this time Kaufman's just enamored of his own fancy. Playing the role of director as well as writer he lacks the perspective or self control needed. The wearying result stars Philip Seymour Hoffman as a depressed schlub theater director called Caden Cotard whose modicum of public recognition doesn't save him from a host of problems, psychological, physical, and marital. And he thinks he's going to die--a thought harped on incessantly that signals the film's other chief weaknesses besides its self-indulgence: its tendentiousness, and, ultimately, its sentimentality. Given a Macarthur ""genius"" award just after his painter wife has taken their little daughter and left him to live in Berlin, protagonist Cotard plunges into a giant, quixotic project that goes on for decades and is never finished. He fashions an outsize stage that's a microcosm of the world--or his world anyway. Perhaps this is the point of using ""synecdoche"" (the rhetorical term for using a part to stand for the whole) in the title. But more likely the word is just a rather childish play on words, since the action's set in Schenectady, and Caden's boxes-within-boxes excess is far from rhetorical elegance: it's not 'synecdoche,' it's a clumsy life-size replica. Kaufman's recreating of Caden Cotard's neurotic, dazed life and his overblown stagecraft gradually emerges as not so much a revelation about the artistic struggle as a compendium of what could be outtakes from every depressed schlub role Hoffman has ever played--all jumbled together without anything to connect them but throwaway displays of cleverness and bizarre, unfunny humor. Despite its ponderousness and ambition, the film never finds a consistent tone.In the first section, which one may long to return to when the tedious repetitions of the theatrical production set in, Caden is suffering a series of Jobian torments and lives in what appears to be a state of justifiable hypochondria. He gets boils, jitters, has a seizure, his pupils don't dilate properly, he's prematurely arthritic, or thinks he is. Worst of all, he's miserably unhappy and afraid of dying. Meanwhile his blithe indifferent wife Adele Lack (Catherine Keener) goes off to Berlin with little Olive (Sadie Goldstein), a child who suffers from green stools, fitting with her name. Caden sees a series of puzzling or bizarre physicians, but just gets more ailments--some of which may be purely psychosomatic. The focus on odious bodily fluids and other disgusting aspects of human decline here is almost (but not quite) worthy of Hieronymous Bosch.Caden has had a critical success with a production of Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesma'n in which the principals are played by young actors--in a self-conscious effort at the Alienation Effect, or to make the audience think about aging. But Adele chides him for not doing something completely his own--thus maliciously opening a Pandora's box of overblown ambition and fanatical verisimilitude, for Caden's effort is to copy everyone he knows. And like computer files, they clone themselves every time they seem to have been canceled out.A number of women resemble Hazel (Samantha Morton), a sweet would-be thespian who buys a house that's perpetually on fire. One of these is Claire Keen (Michelle Williams). Time passes unawares for Caden; Hoffman's makeup shows him getting older by decades. Olive grows up in Berlin as a figure of the local decadent hip culture, covered in tattoos by her best friend, Maria (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who becomes her lesbian lover. Caden's effort to get through to Olive is frustrating and dreamlike. He winds up scrubbing his ex-wife's toilet and kitchen when she's not there. Adele's celebrated paintings, which are said to be marvels of truth and reality, are tiny, and viewers in galleries must wear jeweler's magnifying glasses headsets to walk around and view them. This curious detail is one of many examples of how Kaufman's writing blends the surreal and the comic, and defies the viewer to distinguish between the actual and the dreamed or imagined. Emily Watson and Dianne Wiest round out the interesting female leads, who seem as coldly manipulated as any of Lars von Trier's.Caden's life is marked by a cruel absurdity worthy of the early novels of Nabokovand a smiling Nabokovian doppelgänger appears--Sammy Barnathan (Tom Noonan)--who doesn't resemble Caden at all (he's tall and thin), but qualifies to play him because he has followed him around for 20 years. But Nabokov would have rounded things out elegantly with a mock-detective story finish, is in 'Lolita.' Instead, alas, 'Synecdoche' becomes more and more repetitious and maudlin, the theatrical event Caden is staging becomes increasingly conceptual and uninvolving, and things clunk to a mechanical finish, weighed down by its own ambition, not to mention its tendentiousness and free-floating gloom.This is material that Pirandello explored--thus making it more early modern than post-modern, in fact, though Kaufman often gets the latter label. It also touches on themes that occur in the films of Jacques Rivette. Above all one thinks this whole fantasmagoric production might best have been handled by Fellini. But he already did it, and the result was '8½.' Kaufman hasn't Fellini's visual sense or virtuosity in staging complicated crowd sequences. His actors just pop up awkwardly here and there in clumps.Kaufman and Michel Gondry are two talented cinema artists whose invention needs to be held in check or given a structure, and (surprisingly, perhaps) they collaborated brilliantly in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.' Working on his own as both writer and director in 'The Science of Sleep' and 'Be Kind Rewind,' Gondry grows too whimsical. Here, Kaufman simply has become too self-indulgent, and lacks the passion and empathy of a Werner Herzog in pursuing his quixotic striver."
130,"Synecdoche, New York",,8 January 2012,S.K.E. In Association With Unlikely Story Productions Proudly Present: Philip Seymour Hoffman's poo and wee-wee.,"First we get to watch poo and then wee-wee. Aren't we lucky the director loves us so?The message: don't dwell on death and how long you've got left, but use every moment to live your life to the fullest. (Unsubtle hint: everyone around Hoffman is dying before him. Cle-ver.) Sounds like a Chinese fortune-cookie? Sure does. I've just saved you 2 hours of tedium, unless you'd already made the mistake of thinking this was worth watching just because it was written by the guy who brought us ""Being John Malkovich"". (Well, he also did ""Adaptation"", so his filmography does also warn you.) Yet another pretentious, Oscar-craving, film-critic-pleasing piece of surrealist crap that tortures the viewer for over 120 minutes just so it can make its utterly PREDICTABLE point about life and death. The essential difference between SNY and a Chinese fortune-cookie is that the latter can be read in 3 seconds, while the former lasts for hours. So if you're heading into the DVD store in order to rent this, don't. Go to a Chinese restaurant instead. Come to think of it, it's ironic that a movie that promotes the idea of living life tortures are so much, taking an entire two hours of our own lives.SNY is a wannabe cult drama that descends into its main character's madness and hallucinations far too early on, leaving the increasingly restless viewers with well over an hour to try and survive what are essentially remnants and debris of a plot that goes nowhere after the initial 45 minutes, just so the movie can make its predicable point aka message about life and death, while one funeral follows the next. It's neither funny, nor poignant, but it does get quite boring. Kaufman had made a similar error with ""Eternal Sunshine"" which also has one extremely dull half.The last 75 minutes (i.e. the bulk of the movie) are semi-hallucinatory hogwash that spirals out of control, with time, locations, characters and reality itself all meshing together in one large cauldron of boiling surrealistic pretentious crap which I'd like to call ""Synecdouche"". The film's main theme is rehashed over and over, the middle of the film being stuck in a rut, glued to its own sticky excrement that it had itself ejected all over the filmic canvas. The movie devolves into a one-joke ""comedy"", in which the viewer is supposed to find both humour and intellectual fulfillment in the fact that characters are playing characters that are playing characters that are themselves. Ha-ha hilarious. Monty Python would have turned this unoriginal idea into a 5-minute sketch and then forgotten about it. But here we are with half a movie recycling the some ""joke"" over and over. The last half hour is practically unwatchable. By that point you simply don't care about anyone in the movie - for the very simple reason that nobody is real. At a certain point the viewer has no choice but to completely cease caring anymore about either what happens to the characters or with the non-plot, simply because the border between reality and hallucination become too blurred, and things tend to move in circles rather than developing further. The ""play"" becoming more and more all-encompassing and ever-more characters dying does not constitute ""development""; it merely reflects on the writer (Kaufman) being stuck with a writing block. Yes, we get it. Hoffman, so terrified of dying and so obsessed with disease and physical decay, manages to outlive just about everyone, while decades pass. Sooooo profound. Only half-way through the movie I knew that everyone would die off, leaving Hoffman with the realization that living means not having to oh whatever. I'll leave the ""deeper"" elements of this muddled, failed, awfully monotonous fantasy drama to be analyzed and dissected by those who fell for this 120-minute con-job.But I suppose that surrealism, that magic word we often associate with mostly overrated Euro-trash ""art cinema"", is the one major excuse that the director/writer uses to try and get away with the bulk of the rubbish to be found in SNY. To make matters worse, the dialogue keeps in step with the all-encompassing idiocy hence it too becomes increasingly silly, nearly always lacking in meaning because we really don't even know what exactly it is that is going on anymore - apart from Hoffman still being on mushrooms and everyone dropping off like flies. The obvious and amateurish attempts at profundity fall flat on their faces, much like Hoffman's ""impersonator"" when he so stupidly commits suicide. In the name of art? What a statement. Speaking of which, it's a pity Hoffman's character didn't succeed in jumping off that building. Perhaps that would have ended our suffering sooner.What's with all these sexy women wanting to sleep with Hoffman? The make-up is idiotic too. 17 years pass by and nearly no-one changes noticeably, but then suddenly everyone has tons of make-up glued on to their faces. Duh."
131,"Synecdoche, New York",3,22 June 2009,"Not timeless, Too Modern. A problem.","3 stars for the acting only. This film was overly modern to the point of inauthenticity. The incidental music was emotion provoking in too typical a way throughout the film. Stylistically, Synecdoche felt like a conglomerate copy of quite recent directors like Michel Gondry, Todd Solondz, and Noah Baumbach. I'm not claiming that any of these directors are entirely unique visionaries with exceptional perspectives, but they are such modern examples to mimic. Modern film is becoming a copied copy. Some more straight forward problems with the film include it's tight storyline that loosely unravels into mess and stays there, and that this film was trying to take on too much. I'm not denying that there were a hundred good small ideas within this film, but directly after the viewing, most of them were lost in this modern mess. I don't think this film should be compared to 8 1/2. 8 1/2 feels authentic. To put it another way. If you were to show this film to your father, would he be willing to sit through it?"
132,"Synecdoche, New York",10,28 April 2009,No Man Is An Island,"Synecdoche, New York, is a play on words, as the story takes place is Schenectady, NY. Synecdoche, according to dictionary.com means ""a figure of speech in which a part is used for the whole or the whole for a part, the special for the general or the general for the special"".I know why people won't like this movie, I think, and it makes me disappointed. It is true that Kaufman could use an editor, he is a first time director after all, and is not perfect. There were allot of moments I was repulsed and wanted the movie to end, but then I found myself being sucked back in, the next scene. Few movies can play this kind of continual tug of war of repulsion and attraction as this does, even at the end I wanted/didn't want it to end.Unlike previous Kaufman films there is no discreet ""genre"" mechanism to kick in and explain away the films inconsistencies, there are no sci-fi memory companies, fantastical portals to people's heads, ape-men, or meta-fictional twin brothers with just the right words for the right moment. Instead your left Caden Cotard, a theater director, whose life is slowly deteriorating, until he get's a genius grant and begins the great, true, meaningful work of his life, which is to build replica of New York within a huge abandoned warehouse.""Simulacrum might be a good title"" he says at one point, one of many tiny jokes (like tiny paintings) you will only get for a split second (there's a bus in the fake city, marked as headed to ""Funland"", for another).""Simulacrum"" would be such a good title because almost nothing in this film is the genuine article, the title Synecdoche implies as much. Everyone becomes a character, idealized projection, or distortion in the world of Caden. He reads a diary of his daughter, throughout the film, who hasn't lived with him in years. What he reads is his projection of what she would be writing, which naturally would be about him. This extreme narcissism and melancholic attatchaments(everyone reminds me of her), becomes apparent in the film pretty quickly, the cartoons on the TV in the background, all having a Caden figure, and the re-runs on stage of the moments he's just lived.For me the most beautiful scene(spoiler in next paragraph), is when Caden and Hazel finally move in together into her house that continuously burns but is never consumed...until Caden moves in, and then Hazel dies of smoke inhalation. I don't know if there's been a better metaphor for fantasy, in cinema, I've ever come across. The house is only possible so long as Caden doesn't live inside it! That's why we never see Adele, after she leaves Caden, she appears only as notes, a voice on a tape recorder, her tiny paintings (which you can only see with a magnifying glass; that is to say if you pay Close attention). Though a quick peruse of IMDb, will show how almost every viewer has a different theory for that burning house.You could say, each female character represents a bit of Caden's view of women, and his need to be ""redeemed"" by them; his daughter, his psychologist, his three love interests and eventually the woman comes to replace him as the new Caden, with the exception of his shrink and the New Caden, all reject him at some point (not without good cause). This movie may have more in common with Fellini's ""City Of Women"" than ""8 1/2"".The scenes within the fake city; all revolve around an attempt to tell an honest story, one which includes everyone, every-possible story that could occur, including the story of the creation of the fake city. He includes and re-enacts the story of himself, hiring actors to play himself and the important players in his life, he then has to hire actors to play the actors who become themselves a part of the story in their own right, and on into infinity, until from this germ, he's built an entire world around himself, or a projection of a world.That's not even to start with the other theories that have already started flying around for the ultimate explanation of the movie, which I have heard range from; Caden is God and the theater the imperfect, incomplete world that grows beyond his control, Caden is a suicide in some surreal afterlife of half-complete (like the buildings) thoughts, ""Why did you kill yourself"", ""What?"", ""Why would you kill yourself?""...""Harold Pinter is dead, oh no he just won the Nobel prize"", Caden is having a seizure induced hallucination (he shakes on a bed uncontrollably at one point), but like I said there are no formal ""genre"" mechanisms to let you get comfortable in your knowledge of what to expect next.It's an exhausting movie, very complex and emotionally draining experience, but it is very rewarding (not entertaining). Still, I would have seen again the next day, if I could have. To wax nerd a moment, and quote Samuel R. Delany, ""The General Public is a statistical fiction created by a few exceptional men to make the loneliness of being exceptional a little easier to bear."", that goes as much for audience of an imagined ""everyone"", as it does for Caden's ambitions.My conversation with someone who didn't like it, told me this movie was too long, too confusing, and too depressing. Where I thought it was a bit long, but excellently paced, challenging, funny, and ultimately moving. So to each his own, but if you like movies as more than just entertainment this is probably the first movie this year that really needs to be seen for yourself."""
133,"Synecdoche, New York",9,28 March 2009,"If this film crashes Kaufman's career, it was worth it.","This film was barely given a chance to succeed, but I'm so grateful it was given a chance to be made. Perhaps we can enjoy it all the more knowing that it is so widely unappreciated. There is room for art about exploring our minds and the meaning of life, and this film takes a deep and heart-breakingly beautiful dive into the human psyche and addresses the questions we all deal with when we aren't opting instead to get lost in the distraction of flashing lights. Someone who lacks the patience or interest it takes to understand or appreciate this movie lacks the patience or interest it takes to appreciate and understand themselves. i weep for a nation that only generates $3million for this film at the Box office."
134,"Synecdoche, New York",8,21 March 2009,great ambitions and themes overcome overreaching film-making,"You do have to give the guy credit. When it comes to choosing a theme for his movie, Charlie Kaufman sure doesn't mess around. In fact, he goes straight for the big enchilada, asking how one can find meaning and purpose in a life seemingly devoid of both meaning and purpose. And if it doesn't all work - if Kaufman winds up biting off a bit more than he can chew - well, the effort itself is enough to set his work a notch or two above what most of his film-making contemporaries are putting out these days. The exciting thing about venturing into the mind of Mr. Kaufman is that you can never be entirely certain what you'll find once you're in there. It also goes without saying that you enter such a zone at your own risk. ""Synecdoche, New York,"" his first work as a director, is bound to divide audiences even more strongly than did his previous works as a writer - ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation"" and the superb ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" This is a darkly humorous, wildly surrealistic take on middle age angst - on people who are so consumed by fears about the future that they are unable to live life in the present. Of course, that's a difficult thing to do when the movie is essentially telling us that life is meaningless and that we are all utterly insignificant in the grander scheme of things. Heck, this Kaufman dude makes Ingmar Bergman look like an upbeat dispenser of sunny optimism in comparison.Phillip Seymour Hoffman heads an all-star cast (Catherine Keener, Michelle Williams, Samantha Morton, Hope Davis, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Emily Watson, Diane Wiest, Stanley Krajewski), playing Caden Cotard, a small town theater director who is a raging hypochondriac and who has settled into dull domesticity with his painter wife (Keener) and their four-year-old daughter in fictional Synecdoche, New York. Images of disease and death haunt Caden as he drifts through his days fearing the worst (i.e., a debilitating or fatal illness, a crumbling marriage, failure as a parent, decrepit old age). The movie explores Caden's relationships with various women as he mounts an original theater piece designed to reflect all the major themes of life.Those without an appreciation for the abstract and the absurd may be at a loss as to how to take this film. In a clever conceit, the script accelerates time by almost exponential degrees - emphasizing just how quickly life as we know it passes by. What appear at first blush to be errors in continuity turn out not to be continuity errors at all. Kaufman also takes satirical swipes at the ubiquitous self-help culture, our obsession with medication and death, and the pretentious nature of experimental theater. And for the first half of the movie, it all works splendidly, with the author and his actors expertly drawing us into a world that is both fully recognizable and oddly offbeat simultaneously.Unfortunately, the longer the movie goes on, the more problematic it becomes. As the life on the stage and the life in the world finally merge, the movie becomes so abstracted from reality that we eventually lose touch with the characters. We care about Caden and his problems only up to the point where we can identify with the truths of his existence. Yet, by the later stages of the story, both the character and the movie have become as self-indulgent and pretentious as the very targets they're satirizing. Still, the movie does wend its way to a powerful and touching conclusion, where genuinely great themes are accorded a treatment commensurate with their worth.Hoffman is, as always, outstanding, playing a man who has long since passed away, even though his increasingly imperfect body, for some inexplicable reason, just keeps going on. Keener, Williams and Morton are likewise excellent as the key women in Caden's life.That rare film that is both great and awful in roughly equal measure, ""Synecdoche, New York"" may fall far short of its outrageously ambitious goals, but considering how few movies even have goals of any caliber to fall short of, Kaufman's crazy gamble - for the serious-minded moviegoer at least - is not to be missed."
135,"Synecdoche, New York",10,12 December 2008,Mesmerizing,"After about a half hour, I didn't think I was going to like this film. I was tired and even contemplated leaving the theater. But WOW does this film ever work on you! It beats you up, chews you up and spits you out. I'm guessing Kaufman intentionally lets the first 30 or forty minutes pass with a straightforward and somewhat boring narrative. Quite suddenly there's a piece of unreality - then another - and slowly, very slowly, you realize that SNY's not about a play writer or a particular life but the mind's conception of life. Or perception of life. Or inability to grasp life. Or....row, row, row your boat, life is but a dream. Think Joyce's Ulyssus but instead of a day or two SNY covers about 50 years.In high school an English teacher had us memorize the ""Tomorrow and tomorrow and Tomorrow......."" soliloquy from Macbeth. Seven years later I was an English teacher covering it again. Twenty years later I'm a lawyer with a young English teacher client. She's covering Macbeth...and rather poorly I think. Reciting the soliloquy again I realize that I'm now the same age as Macbeth was when moaning these words and Shakespeare when writing them. And I think I realize that one cannot possibly understand these words unless they've lived as long as Macbeth, Shakespeare and me. There, I finally nailed that soliloquy!No I didn't. I'm likely to read it again when I'm 80 and think I was entirely full of sht when I was 50. What I want to say about Macbeth's soliloquy is what I want to say about SNY. Wait a minute, I mean what I want to say is I'm going to have three or four different takes on the soliloquy and the last will be best. No wrong, they'll all be different takes but they'll be a different me each time. No, wait.............You MUST see this movie!"
136,"Synecdoche, New York",7,20 November 2008,Haunts me the next day.,"Kaufman's work as a writer has always been unusual and fresh. (Adaptation, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Being John Malkovich).This film reaches deep for big ideas about life and death. It is ultimately depressing, but also very ""honest"", whatever that might mean. I feel as I did after seeing Ozu's Tokyo Story which actually changed my view of the world, deepened my feelings for my friends and family.It is a bumpy, rough ride over sharp and course terrain, but here are rare nuggets of insight in this film that make it worth the trip. If you see it, do not expect to be ""entertained"" in the ordinary sense. I can say if you have given much thought to the nature of life and/or your own mortality this is the film for you."
137,"Synecdoche, New York",1,7 January 2018,Drivel from start to finish,"This movie is so appalling I cannot understand how anyone could give it a good review. The cast is impeccable but why, I have to ask, did they agree to be part of something so utterly crass? It is drivel almost from start to finish - actually, I didn't even get to the end..."
138,"Synecdoche, New York",9,3 September 2017,"Smart, postmodern movie, well worth watching","This is a movie about a depressed playwright who receives a ""genius"" grant and tries to justify himself (and his series of failed romantic relationships) by producing the most profound play imaginable. Very funny for smart people (which includes many of us). Basically fantastic and absurd, It also succeeds in being conspicuously postmodern at the same time it satirizes postmodernism. This should not surprise us, since self-reflective irony holds a central position in postmodernism. Not all the absurdism worksa few scenes seem unnecessarily forcedbut what does work is bitterly hilarious. Moreover, I liked it that some of its most profound insights are hidden in throwaway lines and non-climactic scenes. Highly recommended for those who don't require car chases in their movies (not that I've got anything against that)."
139,"Synecdoche, New York",10,2 September 2017,"Its unflinchingly honest but presented in a slightly surreal, dreamlike way.","Its a Charlie Kaufman film (both written and directed) so its not one for casual movie watchers. Its a deep, harsh, unrelenting and real movie about human interactions, death, life ambitions, relationships, the small steps in life that have far reaching consequences and the feelings of doubt and regret that plague us all from time to time. Its unflinchingly honest but presented in a slightly surreal, dreamlike way.If you like other Kaufman films, then you certainly need to see this."
140,"Synecdoche, New York",10,9 August 2017,A profoundly satisfying experience.,"It was a tragedy, watching this life unravel so. I was very moved and wore a frown for days (weeks? months?). I couldn't bring myself to watch it again when it came round on TV, for fear of plunging to the same depths of despair the first experience had inflicted on me. But I did. I now hide behind a big stupid grin. I don't know why the tragedy overshadowed the comedy the first time round but this time the humour really shone through. It's so funny! The attention to detail is incredible. Nothing's left to chance and you won't spot a single incongruity that wasn't intended. Best film I've seen for a good while. A profoundly satisfying experience."
141,"Synecdoche, New York",10,7 August 2017,Love for this film grows exponentially with each viewing.,"Charlie Kaufman is known for is very deep messaging in his very odd stories. He is the most human writer every, he understands what the rules for good story telling is in film and say ""screw those rules, check this out"" and makes a story about literally going into people's minds and being them or living in and deleting their memories. He writes with purpose and Synecdoche has the biggest purpose. Synecdoche, New York is the saddest film, but the most meaningful and connecting. It will make you not only think different, but live different. It is important that you see this movie. Though Synecdoche failed the box office, it is one of the greatest films ever."
142,"Synecdoche, New York",8,5 August 2017,Good Acting and a Unique Story,"Synecdoche, New York is a great film, and I may be a little late throwing in my thoughts here, but here I am anyway.Hoffman is electric and dynamic, as always. His performance is like an onion in that it has many layers and brings me to tears, and when the tears pass I am then left with a large amount of existential dread. All of the supporting cast looks fantastic as well, although in a piece as out there as this one, it seems like you could justify a wide variety of choices outside the norm without having your performance suffer as much as in a generic blockbuster.The story and direction by Kaufman is fantastic. The actors are guided, yet given their own creative space in what seems like a nice balance. The writing, though not always as clear as a general audience would like, is deep and though evoking.The cinematography stands out to me stands out as the weak point of the film, although that does not mean it was bad. It seemed very generic and sort of out of the way, almost impersonal which seems strange when compared to how incredibly personal the performance by Hoffman and story of Kaufman are. If being unnoticed was the goal here, that goal was achieved. The cinematography does not detract from the film at all, but it doesn't add anything either.Overall, one of the better films I've seen, and one of the more inspiring to me as an actor, seeing a performance like this. That being said, you must really be into film to enjoy something like this."
143,"Synecdoche, New York",2,4 August 2017,Plain Frustrating and Bad,"SNY is an amalgamation of touching stimuli of experience that is awfully executed in disarray. Caden is never really alone yet he sees the world with such destitute.The film has elements of great life affirming messages that'll touch people. However, composing a film is like a jigsaw. The pieces once put together should reveal a picture, however distorted the picture may be. This film didn't show me a distorted picture, but rather a picture that had pieces missing and pieces muddled."
144,"Synecdoche, New York",10,11 July 2017,"hyperreality affects the mind, the spirit, and the body","I wouldn't go so far as to call Charlie Kaufman's ""Synecdoche, New York"" one of the greatest movies of its decade, but its intellectual profundity makes it one of the most impressive pieces of work. This story of a theater director whose life is unraveling has so many layers that it's hard to describe. An obvious point is that the movie goes to great lengths to blur fiction and reality, as the protagonist's play begins to look more and more like real life.An important point is that time progresses throughout the movie without the characters stating it, or background objects showing it. The protagonist is shown aging, as is his daughter, while he expands his model city. Interestingly, the warehouse is impossibly large, while his ex-wife's art gets smaller over the course of the movie.Key to the movie is Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance. He plays Caden as a man at the end of his emotional rope, just like Willy Loman (whom Caden plays early on). It's too bad that Hoffman isn't with us anymore. I have no doubt that he would still be playing great roles were he alive today.Plenty of outstanding support comes from the rest of the cast. Catherine Keener, Samantha Morton, Michelle Williams, Tom Noonan, Emily Watson, Hope Davis, Dianne Wiest, and the rest of them show themselves to be some of the finest performers of our era.Basically, any film buff owes it to himself/herself to see this movie."
145,"Synecdoche, New York",,18 June 2017,Sure,"Its so stupid to review this, nothing matters, the background of the people featured in the film is unknown to me, I cannot understand who i s is who, or why does that or that happen, I still doubt the reality of the play, the reality or the truth it can sexist to it, nor the lack of good photography or structure matter, how would it matter? As Aristotle once might have said, something is good if it fulfilled its intention and this... this gets that right, the realization of that thinking is surrounding the words. It's scary. The last song killed me."
146,"Synecdoche, New York",10,15 July 2016,One of the best directorial debuts of all time,"The plot is simply put, Caden Cotard (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a depressed and lonely theatre director who wins a Mcarthur Genius Grant and begins constructing an epic theatre piece based on his life. As his life becomes more tangled and confused, the piece grows and threatens to consume his life.Many of you may read that plot description and say the movie is not about that at all. You would be right. Describing the plot does nothing to communicate the experience of watching this movie. The most accurate way to describe it is it feels like someone's dreams and real life crashing together until you can't tell which is which.Every element of the movie is done to perfection. Every performance is fantastic (Even the kid!) with Philip Seymour Hoffman as the standout star giving one of the best performances of his impressive career. With so many different subtleties in the character's thoughts and feelings being communicated brilliantly. The cinematography is great on it's own, but when considering most of the frames in the movie have to communicate more than simply the focus of the scene the precision of each shot becomes a lot more impressive. The score by Jon Brion is as original and great as always, and Charlie Kaufman's contributions to the lyrics make for yet more to consider in a given scene.And now that I've brought him up, I suppose I should talk about the man behind Synecdoche, New York, Charlie Kaufman. This was Charlie Kaufman's first time directing a movie, however he has done stellar work in the past writing for movies like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Adaptation, and Being John Malkovich. The dreamlike way the story unfolds makes the movie virtually impossible to fully grasp without multiple watches, and having seen the movie many times there are still parts I don't understand. However, it is also clear to me that nothing is random. In fact, it is incredibly impressive the pinpoint precision with which each detail is layed down in relation to everything else. From referencing other works of literature, to naming the characters, to the day's date, and specific reoccurring dialogue quirks, everything has its purpose and everything has its role.I think that Synecdoche, New York is one of the greatest films of all time and is absolutely worth your time, money, and your thoughts. However, it is important to mention that this film is not very accessible. The complexity, and the depressing nature of the movie will frustrate and tire many. Regardless, of whether you love it or hate it, I think most would agree it's at least something worth discussing."
147,"Synecdoche, New York",10,1 July 2016,Let me keep this short. The movie may or may not be depressing.,"I know I was so off put by the reviews here on IMDb because they made me worried that this film might make me deeply depressed. Well I finally watched the film and it's a masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made. Was I depressed? Yeah but only until I realized why. To me this is a movie about what not to do with your life rather than what you are doomed to do. Most of the characters live disappointing lives and that's what this movie is really about, a disappointing life. I think that if you're a very happy person, which I am, this film is a hard pill to swallow but once it's down and you've let it sit for a little while you feel so much better. To me this was a film that validated the decisions I make in my life to let go of the pain and move on strive to find happiness and love. So don't be afraid of the sad reviews. This is a beautiful film that brings me joy to see. Crazy as it seems, it's true."
148,"Synecdoche, New York",10,7 April 2016,A lonely masterpiece,"Synecdoche, New York must be one of the powerful and insightful movies about loneliness, love, life and death I've ever saw. There's too much to think about the human being on this movie which made this movie a little bit hard to watch, and its slow pace (necessary, IMHO) build up more struggle, but it's worth.The casting for this screen is amazing, but the outstanding acting of Philip Seymour Hoffman is the real deal. His character (Caden Cotard) appears on almost every single scene. It's his movie and he carries it right upon his shoulders, and made it fantastic. We can feel his pain, his loneliness. It's too easy to empathize with him. There's too much feeling on it!We knew Kaufman for his previews works (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), but Synecdoche, New York is the first directing work he did. We can see a lot of influence by Jonze and Gondry on the screen, but I think his signature is on the screenplay and, since he wrote it, this dictates the pace of the movie. The cinematography is brilliant and I think his directing was genius. The movie is slow to make us feel it. It has to be hard to watch. Living is hard, dying is hard too. With an outstanding acting and a genius directing, the soundtrack the brings us inside the movie, should be good, right? And it's fantastic. Jon Brion is delicate and passionate. It's a lovely, deep and touching soundtrack, just as good as his Eternal Sunshine work.One of the best and meaningful movies ever made. I know it will be hard to watch, it's a slow movie and too thoughtful, but it's intent to be this way. We need to feel it to love it. We need to feel the loneliness, the love, the life, the death, our meaning. Feel everything, and feel slowly (this way, we can learn with it). A real magnum opus"
149,"Synecdoche, New York",10,22 March 2016,One of my favourite films of all time,"Not only is Charlie Kaufman the best screenwriter working in the business today, he's also made one of the best debut's in cinematic history. To date, he has 2 films to his name (directorial wise: Anomalisa and Synecdoche New York) and both of them I would consider to be pretty flawless. Why? because no matter how many times you watch these films, you will be able to find new meaning. This is something only the best of writers can do.On a surface level of cinema, everything was done to perfection alone: The acting was excellent, the pacing is perfect, the plot is one of the most in depth plots ever, the cinematography is perfect, the framing is amazing... look, it's all perfect okay?So I wont go into to detail about the meanings I found within the plot because it's better left up to the imagination in my opinion, but it's a very personal film to me and I've never related to a film this much.I'd recommend this film as one of the best films ever made and if you like your cinema smart then give this one a go. And don't just take my word for it Roger Ebert (rest in peace) said that this was the best film of the decade."
150,"Synecdoche, New York",7,17 March 2016,"regarding DEATH, Time inconformity, and other infinite games","The idea here is mainly Death, the agony in every one's life is accompanied by sudden moments of mockery even regarding the sources of pain in other characters' lives as well as the main character's life, who finally notices that each other character is not an extra but a main character in his own mind, or world. the idea behind the events were about to express the triviality that lurks in the act of a man trying to portray himself while he is portraying himself, which results in a man sitting painting in front of a tableau, inside the tableau a man is sitting painting in front of a tableau ...etc. As has always been, the idea of death, when it rules, makes every thing looks pale and useless>> as it is. No euphemism is cared for, and no simplification for the mundane is employed."
151,"Synecdoche, New York",6,27 February 2016,highly ambitious,"Theater director Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is physically falling apart. He is working on the play Death of a Salesman with his leading lady Claire Keen (Michelle Williams). His wife Adele Lack (Catherine Keener) goes on a trip with their daughter Olive. Box office girl Hazel (Samantha Morton) keeps flirting with him. He gets a grant and rents out a giant space. He starts building a play where the cast does everyday things. The world inside the giant space starts becoming more real than the real world. Caden and Claire become parents with a girl as reality and fiction become indistinguishable.This is a highly ambitious movie coming from the outsider mind of Charlie Kaufman. The start is pretty slow especially with a depressed Philip Seymour Hoffman. The movie turns very loopy, imaginative and utterly original. This is a movie trying to be life itself. It loses some of its cohesiveness as it tries to be too much. At times, I'm both resigned to not being able to grab hold of the story and interested to see more loopy ideas. I give Kaufman full marks for being unrestrained in his vision but this may need a bit more to make it an accessible watch."
152,"Synecdoche, New York",10,7 January 2016,The miserable tale of one insignificant man,"Perhaps the most intellectually stimulating movie of all time. ""Synecdoche, New York"" is just one of those films that lingers in your mind even after you've seen it, and begs for multiple viewings. The genius of Charlie Kaufman and his heavy attention to the detail is almost reminiscent of past greats such as Stanley Kubrick and Ingmar Bergman. Kaufman is able to craft a movie that is able to apply so greatly to our fears, struggles and faults through the relateable character Caden. The movie explores themes of death, un- fulfillment, and the flow of time itself. Synecdoche, New York constantly has you pausing and pondering what is going on with its erratic timeline and dream like world. The craziness of this movie is not for everyone, I for one had to watch this two times after to feel as though I had the full experience this movie had to offer. However this movie made me think deeply more than any movie ever has done for me, and in the end that is what a movie is seeking out to do. If a movie has made me feel depressed and strangely enlightened as Synecdoche has done than it has succeeded. It would be a crime to rule out the astounding performances, most notably Phillip Seymour Hoffman for the leading role. It would be a crying shame not to note the script that is always able to invoke a sense of mystery and sadness into all speech.All in all it is hard to talk about this movie in a non-spoiling manner, seeing as the whole movie is vastly changing and surprising at every corner, however I will leave you with the statement that even if you find the movie dull or frankly depressing (and it is hard to disagree with the depressing part). It is almost impossible to deny that this movie has not gone to great lengths to make you feel and to make you relate to the story at hand no matter how abstract it is. If you are a fan of thinking outside of the box or simply art films as a whole Charlie Kaufmans masterpiece Synecdoche, New York is a must see."
153,"Synecdoche, New York",6,19 August 2015,"Dark, Gritty and Unsatisfying","Synecdoche, New York (sɪ ˈnɛk də ˌki) is a synecdoche of Schenectady, New York; the city where the film begins. This film is thought provoking in a way that first attracted me to independent/Foreign/art-house cinema and has stirred this veteran film enthusiast to sit down and pen his thoughts for the first time in years. For that, I am grateful.First of all, the film is not great, but it does steep the viewer in a dark and gritty alternate reality and leaves a deep impression. The meaning of the film can be summed up in three quotes:""I will be dying and so will you, and so will everyone here. That's what I want to explore. We're all hurtling towards death, yet here we are for the moment, alive. Each of us knowing we're going to die, each of us secretly believing we won't.""""What was once before you - an exciting, mysterious future - is now behind you. Lived; understood; disappointing. You realize you are not special. You have struggled into existence, and are now slipping silently out of it. This is everyone's experience. Every single one. The specifics hardly matter. Everyone's everyone. So you are Adele, Hazel, Claire, Olive. You are Ellen. All her meager sadnesses are yours; all her loneliness; the gray, straw-like hair; her red raw hands. It's yours. It is time for you to understand this.""""As the people who adore you stop adoring you; as they die; as they move on; as you shed them; as you shed your beauty; your youth; as the world forgets you; as you recognize your transience; as you begin to lose your characteristics one by one; as you learn there is no-one watching you, and there never was, you think only about driving - not coming from any place; not arriving any place. Just driving, counting off time. Now you are here, at 7:43. Now you are here, at 7:44. Now you are...""Kaufman's blend of surrealism and a seemingly 25-to-30-year thread of stream- of consciousness is admirable. As for the surrealism, the film brings to bear the truism that we all see with our emotions. No two people see the same thing the same way. We are, as sentient beings, unable to see purely photographically. In it's surrealism, the film is sometimes comical, sometimes haunting, but always apt. As for the film's attempt at stream-of-consciousness, it lacks sophistication. Considering the film's Demille-esque sized ensemble-cast and the scale of the film's cinematic and rhetorical reach, Kaufman invites comparison with landmark works. And, when compared with the 1927 film Metropolis by Fritz Lang or William Faulkner's novel The Sound and the Fury , Synecdoche, with it's faux- obscurity, simply does not measure up.The dramatic arch of the film effectively supports the premise that ""We're all hurtling towards death, yet here we are for the moment, alive."" However, when Caden is provided the financial means to build an enormous alternate-reality city/movie-set in a huge abandoned dome in Manhattan though funding from a MacArthur Genius Grant, it is difficult to suspend one's disbelief. The grant pays a whopping $625,000. Nice, for sure, but really? Also, the death of most of the cast at the end, whether real or surreal, does not serve the plot but rather seems like a cheap exit strategy from a movie that would otherwise never end. In all, the film steeps the viewer in a dark and gritty alternate reality and leaves a deep impression. However, the film's cloak of art and intellectualism covers a poorly constructed premise. This may be why I had not heard of it for seven years."
154,"Synecdoche, New York",10,19 August 2015,Kaufman on steroids,"Kaufman's first attempt as a director of his own material is unexpectedly confident and the result is truly amazing. The complexity of the story and the way it interweaves real and imitated life borders on post-modernism. Like his main character, Kaufman sets out to make a movie that is going to be brutal in its honesty, leaving no stone unturned. Fortunately, unlike his protagonist, he manages to keep the endeavor from spinning out of control and becoming incomprehensible (David Lynch should take notes). Whether what we see is real or an elaborate dream is intentionally left open to interpretation. There is enough material here to set your brain ablaze trying to dissect it and understand it all."
155,"Synecdoche, New York",10,25 July 2015,It has something for anyone at any time,"There are very few films in which I think everyone should watch. This is one of those pictures. I could probably write a 100 000 word essay on my full and ultimate interpretation and analysis of this film, but I won't. This is truly something you yourself as an individual have to experience and try to get behind for all the little subtleties throughout the film.Charlie Kaufman, the director and writer of this picture, stated that he wanted to make a film that would be different every time you watch it, and that is something I can honestly guarantee you. There are so many underlying themes in the movie that you could probably watch it twice in the same day and get a film that underneath surface level is something completely different. Maybe you view it as a depressing art film analyzing regret and the sorrow it has on people's life. But yet your mother sees the picture as a movie that is just there as random nonsense.The people who hate this movie will not hate it because they interpreted it differently. They will hate it because they do not choose to infer for themselves. This film asks you for a bit of your imagination, and if you give, you're in for something absolutely incredible.A lot of the time I see this marketed as a comedy, And in my perspective, this is anything but. Yet it goes to show that Synecdoche, New York is just what you make it out to be. After all, like what Roger Ebert once said, that not only is this the best film of the decade. This film is about you."
156,"Synecdoche, New York",3,19 July 2015,Well... that's 2 hours of my life I will never get back!,"Let me just say, I am generous on the IMDb with regards to ratings. Therefore I give this film 3/10.I understood what the film was getting at. It studies a man with no concept of time passing, whose life starts to confuse fiction and reality. The film also includes a burning house as, what I believe, to be a metaphor for the general decay of our existence and how we decay from the moment we are born. However, my question is: who comes up with this stuff? Regardless of the subtle undertones, the whole film was bizarre, depressing, boring and thoroughly uninteresting. The first 20 minutes, I grant you were, seemed as if the film may be good. It proceeded to descend further and further into the weird and pointless.By the second half of the film, I found myself constantly looking at the timer to see how long I had left. Just because a film is clever with lots of deeper meaning, it does not make it worth watching. I had to question the sanity of not only the main character, but the others as well. For example, whilst Hoffman's character is developing his production of a replica of New York to be shown as a play of some sort, one of the actor's asks 'When are we going to get an audience? It's been 17 years'. Who in their right mind would stay as part of production for so long without actually having a showing? The lack of logic there was impressive and irritating, even with some deeper meaning.I can genuinely say that I enjoyed Batman & Robin more than this piece of rubbish. I will not be viewing this film a second time."
157,"Synecdoche, New York",10,14 July 2015,A caricaturesque and yet dramatic view of life,"It's been quite some time since a movie has moved me this much, not only cause I see big part of me reflected on the screen (and I think all of us see some of ourselves on this movie), but also for the performances, script and cinematography on this picture.I saw this film cause I'm a huge Phillip Seymour Hoffman fan, but never expected that it would tech me so much. Almost impossible to summarize the film, and I don't intend to, this movie really reflects how most of us spend our lives being afraid of taking risks, of feeling our emotions and of embracing life as it is. And we spend too much time thinking of all the thing s that could go wrong if we live a little, without even being aware of it, and then when we realize what we really wanted to do, how we could've actually been happy and achieved our dreams, it's just too late.This movie is definitely not for everyone, as lots of Charlie Kiffnan's films, but to the people that do like this type of strange, and abstract kind of film, it would be a huge eye opener, punch in the face, live some more kind of thing, without being scared to feel, and not caring about what other people think, what a masterpiece."
158,"Synecdoche, New York",10,24 June 2015,Stunning Performance Piece and Deeply Disturbing,"This director is notorious for the odd but this is such an existential think piece that it qualifies as one of the most challenging, thoughtful films ever made. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent and the entire cast is nothing less than exceptional. One performance in particular is unique in its power and overwhelming in its quiet intensity. Emily Watson is superb in this film and the character she essays is one of the most beautifully realized in the history of cinema. In a lengthy scene in which she plays opposite Hoffman in as if nothing is out of the ordinary, she is completely and utterly nude. It is a brave performance where she is unafraid to exhibit a less than perfect body as a powerful statement in regard to female sexuality. Anyone who experiences this segment of the film can not help but be staggered by its simple beauty and heartbreaking reality. If for no other reason than this single element of the film and Emily Watson's gifted work, Synecdoche, New York deserves your serious consideration."
159,"Synecdoche, New York",9,23 September 2013,Complex intriguing psychological narrative that frays at the end,"Really excellent film, complex intriguing psychological narrative with so many threads that its like a 3 dimensional chess game. The performances are moving and real even though the world the characters live in is full of multiple interconnected realities. The central themes (I will let you discover what they are) are presented in a super original and completely engaging way. I think the film frays in the last act though. It is so hard to hold together all the emotional, narrative and thematic strands. The consequence is a final act that gets somewhat lost and overly long as the story peters out to its profane (as opposed to secular) conclusion. Nonetheless you will probably want to watch it until the very end."
160,"Synecdoche, New York",9,24 July 2013,Titles are tricky...,"A second viewing for me, via BBC, after half a documentary (by R.B. Weide) about Woody Allen, late at night. And, as expected, I liked it even better than the first time. It's really a film that sucks you in, and, in a way, spits you out at the end ('die'). Or maybe it does so more than once throughout the film, because it is at times quite unpleasant how confrontational death, depression and heartache are here put into words and images.The story starts relatively simple as a family drama about two artists (the husband a conservative stage director, the wife a struggling painter) and their daughter (who's poop appears to be green). Soon things start to fall apart for them as a family, but the wife becomes very successful in Europe with her work, leaves her husband and takes their daughter with her. He also succeeds career-wise and wins a prize with which he can finance a new, much bigger project. And so he does, more than ever wanting to make a difference with it. The way story expands there, reminded me a little of the work M.C. Escher: the film becomes a terribly complicated - yet endlessly fascinating - mosaic-like vehicle, where every new detail seems to simply lead back - directly of via detour - to where it began. In the end, the stage director Caden Cotard also ends up just about where he started out, and while his gigantic project collapses, he has one final 'perfect' day with an old love, the box office girl...In some ways, this seemed like an elaboration on 'Being John Malkovich' (for which director Kaufman wrote the script), in which there is also this dark atmosphere of human nature inanely fighting against the ruthlessness of time and chance (and also, in the end, there is this 'guiding voice' inside a person's head), though 'Synecdoche, New York' can very, very well stand on its own.Acting-wise, you can hardly ask for more than this, with Hoffman playing beautifully once again. I also really enjoyed Tom Noonan, and Catherine Keener certainly needs a mention, too, without wanting to deny the rest of the cast their due credit. The enormous arena where a great part of the film takes place is just wonderfully intriguing, but even the smaller and simpler settings (like Hazel's perpetually burning house or even Caden and Adele's house) were done beautifully.One more point out of 10 this time around."
161,"Synecdoche, New York",9,4 July 2013,A movie explores deeply personal feelings about life.,"This is a stark and harrowing interpretation about the meaning of life. The director is trying to explore that nature and meaning of human condition. As a message movie, that is, a movie which strives not only to tell a story but has an underlying philosophical theme, the audience is asked to think about the movie in terms of their own lives. That is, the movie is a consciousness raising experience. The movie's principal character, a stage director, is unhappy with his life and wants to do something that makes a difference. The way he goes about accomplishing that goal is personal, emotionally laden, and self-indulgent so that it is virtually impossible to follow his line of thought - especially since there is more than one line. This adds to the movie's realism which underscores the director's struggle to clearly say something meaningful while struggling to deal with his emotions and disappointments. What is the purpose of living? The movie contains strong performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman and a long and an impressive array of female players, including Catherine Keener and Emily Watson and Michelle Williams."
162,"Synecdoche, New York",9,17 June 2013,"If ""My Dinner With Andre"" were told visually","In one sense, ""Synecdoche, New York"" is about a life lived in theater. On another level, it is about life, the universe, and everything. To that extent it is similar, thematically, to the wonderful ""My Dinner with Andre"" (1981). Yet it is the opposite of that movie in terms of presentation, preferring larger-than-life visuals and grotesque imagery over minimalism, and visualizing its abstract flights of fancy instead of simply describing them. At times Charlie Kaufman's script overreaches. But then, falling short of one's aims is one of the themes of the film. It is darkly funny, well-acted, and just as uncomfortable as it needs to be."
163,"Synecdoche, New York",6,3 January 2013,The Vidiot Reviews,"Synecdoche, New YorkThe difficulty in casting someone to play you in a production of your life is finding an actor with features that match your body dysmorphic image.Luckily, the director in this drama not only found someone to play himself but everyone in his life.After separating from his wife (Catherine Keener), stage director Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman) receives a fellowship, which he uses to finance a navel-gazing piece about his existence as a means to deconstruct it.Going so far as constructing life-sized sets of NYC inside of a warehouse and casting actors to portray him (Tom Noonan) and the women (Samantha Morton, Emily Watson, Dianne Wiest, Michelle Williams) that occupy his self-obsessed life.One man's esoteric exploration into his past transgressions, Synecdoche, New York is writer/director Charlie Kaufman's own inaccessible magus opus. However, the advantage to directing your own biographical stage-play is that you make an excellent understudy. (Yellow Light)vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
164,"Synecdoche, New York",,9 October 2011,"Unusual, but very watchable...","I watched this film on a recommendation, one I picked up online somewhere. After the first few minutes I was wondering just what this crazy film was all about and just why was I bothering with it? I persevered though and it got better, I began to understand the characters and it got better still, if a bit weirder. I'll tell you what I thought about it by the end after this brief summary.Caden Cotard is a playwright and theatre director, he is married to artist, Adele Lack, and they have a daughter, Olive. They live in Synecdoche, upstate New York (hence the title) where Caden is worried about his health. When Adele doesn't come to the opening night of his new play, Caden also begins to suspect things are not quite as stable at home as he thought. Soon after, Adele announces that she is going on a trip to Berlin and she will be taking Olive with her. Caden is somewhat dumbstruck, but continues living in New York. He is awarded a substantial prize for his work and decides to produce a play about his life and the people around him. As time passes he has relationships with several women, Claire Keen, with whom he had another daughter, Arial, and Hazel, who was to play a big part in his future. As he finds premises to put the play on and actors to play the many parts he has in mind the world outside moves on. I really don't want to say too much more, it's quite difficult to put down in words anyway and so I'll leave it here Don't want those Spoiler Police playing the part of the Spoiler Police and chasing me down now.I found this quite a strange film to watch, it has the scale of something like 'Brazil' by Terry Gilliam but also the snappy dialogue and soul searching of something by Woody Allen. All the performances were excellent, in particular Philip Seymour Hoffman as Caden Cotard, he played the role brilliantly. Also worthy of note were; Catherine Keener as Adele Lack, Tom Noonan as Sammy Barnathan, Michelle Williams as Claire Keen, Samantha Morton as Hazel and Dianne Wiest as Ellen Bascomb / Millicent Weems.As I've already said, this is quite a strange film to watch, it blurs the lines between Caden's real life and the life he is trying to portray on the stage. I found it quite refreshing, although it did drag on a bit towards the end. The scope of the film is quite magnificent, it spans several decades, or appears to, and yet Caden never seems to get any closer to finally opening the doors and letting an audience in. I found it quite touching in places but also found it hard to have much sympathy for Caden because all of he woes he brought down upon himself. At the end of the day though, it's well worth a look; it will make you think if nothing else!... Recommended.My Score: 7.1/10.IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 22,876 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 68/100 (based on 175 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."
165,"Synecdoche, New York",10,21 August 2011,A triumph,"A film that somehow makes all of Kaufman's previous works look unambitious in comparison. Muddled up somewhere in this elaborate construct is the story of a life, theorizing about art and simulation, love, death, the creative process, and seemingly just about everything else. Synechdoche, NY takes the form of an inverted bildungsroman, where a normal, relatively productive adult sees his life and the world fall apart around him and journeys into a kind of second childhood, acknowledging his ignorance and impotence. But of course, that normal middle-class life was perhaps not so happy after all -- Caden's body and his life are already frayed around the edges, doomed by the thousand tiny but heartbreaking everyday tragedies. As this malaise grows larger and larger, the film shifts genres from dark comedy to transcendent drama, all with Kaufman's signature string of absurdism running underneath.This is Kaufman's directorial debut, and he doesn't seem like a first-timer at all, creating indelible images with all the confidence required to make a movie like this. He also relies on great performances, most notably by Phillip Seymour Hoffman who captures perfectly the life-worn dreamer that is Caden, but also by the cast of veterans that play the various women that float through Caden's life. A tremendous film, whose divisiveness is only a sign of its greatness, Synechdoche, NY, miraculously fulfils its own grand ambition."
166,"Synecdoche, New York",8,29 May 2011,"Excellent, if a little depressing","Wow, this film is astonishing. Charlie Kaufman, who of course has written some great screenplays has finally outdone himself with this film - which also marks his directing debut. I find it very hard to describe/review the film, as it is quite confusing (but I think I get it) and I don't want to mislead anyone reading this review in terms of what the film is about, but what I will say is that it deals basically with life and death and the meaning of those to things in relation to one another. And all I can say is that through some quite wonderful scenes in the film - these main two themes are visually realised perfectly. Philip Seymour Hoffman is awesome (as is always the case) and the supporting cast ain't bad either. So to conclude, the films great but I've only given it 8* instead of 10* because of the fact that it is not only one of the best films I have seen in recent years, but it's ultimately the most depressing film I ever scene my entire life, which inevitably marks it down a little. Still if it sounds like your bag - go check it out - it's worth it."
167,"Synecdoche, New York",,15 April 2011,Like nothing else I've ever seen,"So what's the purpose of existence? That's the jumping off point for Charlie Kaufman's vivid portrait of a theatre director's obsessive quest for love and truth-in-art; a film that's sprawling and meticulous, brilliant, maddening and desolate. Philip Seymour Hoffman is Caden Cotard, a gifted, complex, unhappy man who may be dying. Winning a ""genius"" grant from an arts board, he proceeds to mount a vast, unstaged, 17-year play about his own life, focusing on his relationships with an idolising actress (Michelle Williams), a cleaner as whom he himself poses (portrayed by an actress played by Dianne Wiest) and the love of his life (Samantha Morton), realised in the play by Emily Watson. Still with me? Oh well. Like the play-within-the-film, Synecdoche, New York is insightful, nightmarish, ambitious, often intelligent, sometimes very funny - though its jokes are largely confined to the opening half - and stuffed with ideas, acute observations and surreal touches. Like having Cotard's cute little daughter Olive become a sexually-aggressive tattooed lesbian nudie-booth dancer who speaks only in German. And having Hoffman claim - as an aside - that there are only 13 million people in the world. There are missteps, largely borne of a slight restlessness that wrenches the movie away from some of its more intriguing scenarios almost as soon as they've begun and moments of self-conscious oddity, but it's difficult to remember a film as bursting with imagination, frustration and human misery. And the acting is phenomenal. It's a shame that Watson is given relatively little to do - as I've said before, she's simply the best actress around - but Hoffman is faultless and Morton just irressistible, continuing to deliver on the remarkable promise she displayed in Sweet and Lowdown and Morvern Callar. At last directing one of his own scripts, Kaufman - the writer of Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Human Nature and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - has created something utterly unique. And really miserable."
168,"Synecdoche, New York",10,27 February 2011,Charlie Kaufman and I Have Little Faith In Humanity,"The fact that Synecdoche doesn't score a perfect 10 on IMDb's star rating system is absolute, incontestable proof that we, as a culture, as a species, are fast approaching a cataclysmic end. You fair and decent citizens that are not of the same mind as me on this issue  those of you who do not know that we are all very soon doomed  are more than entitled to your opinions; your tragically ignorant, depressingly inaccurate opinions. Synecdoche, NY is not only a monumentally remarkable cinematic achievement, a towering tribute to the magic of human thought, but also a poignantly sentimental eulogy to our quickly destructing society.It's difficult, almost impossible, to inform a society that they are on their very last legs. There's so much biological, genetic, instinctual behavior in people that insists on life, that is denying the overwhelming evidence that we are on the verge of annihilation. We are not just passively witnessing, but energetically participating in our own negation. The facts are formidable. The science is impeccable. Our over-sized, extravagant lifestyles are unsustainable. All the best data indicates that civilization is gorging itself as it hurtles towards collapse. There's only so much we can do to prevent this catastrophe, only a limited number of options to grasp at to forestall this morbid fate. But are we choosing any one of these viable, sensible paths? No. Not really. Rather, we are accelerating our irresponsible, destructive, evil ways. We are so f$%@ed.So Charlie Kaufman has got to do SOMETHING with himself amidst this nihilistic mayhem that is American culture. What does he do? He writes and produces and directs a movie that expresses, that embodies, that is material evidence of the revoltingly irrational mentality that is guiding our failing system. He is commenting on not only our preposterous national philosophy but also on our pandemic impotence to save ourselves. Charlie Kaufman, who has written many wonderful films  a couple of the most remarkable I've ever seen  has finally described, very plainly, what's been bothering him all along. The world that he has created in Synecdoche, NY is a desperate, frantic theater stage whose immense scale and minute details he endlessly increases and refines. Contrived perhaps to offer a glimpse of man's formidably powerful capacity to self obsess, this artificial realm is quite impressive, but the result is ultimately a monument to futility. He wants to be positive but his better angels tell him different. There's nothing more to fight for. There's nothing more to defend. The end is near. Game Over...And still, his film is wonderful. It reverberates with humanity, decency, nobility, and intelligence. It's so obviously the product of a mind that is probing and receptive and gentle and generous. In fact, that curiously self reflexive, fixated mind has been the true subject of all his films. The phenomenon of self awareness has always fascinated Charlie and he described his absurd hyper critical condition so masterfully in Being John Malkovich. In The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Charlie wants us to see the error of our ways, to catch ourselves before we fall. And this latest film is a blatant cry for attention, for us to stop and consider just exactly what it is we are discarding so thoughtlessly, so casually. He has fashioned a sort of amplified soapbox from which he implores us to correct our ways. He has contrived a cinematic method that echoes this  like a mighty holler in a vast canyon. It's a dour, broken, self obsessed world he's depicted, and a sadly familiar one at that. But he's also expressed a delicate desire for change, for salvation. You don't actually hear him or anyone else say it so directly, but the sentiment is there. That's the genius of this film. That's the art of this work. That's the bit that made me want to write this review. As morose and morbid as this film appears to be it is actually hilarious. It's sublimely absurd, that image of the minuscule, adorable shipping crates  complete with diminutive shipping labels and stickers  into which Adele (Catherine Keener) packs her postage size paintings. The constantly misunderstood medical diagnoses that Caden (Philip Seymour Hoffman) hears as clinically somber men first state that his various conditions are benign, but then indicate it could be serious, even fatal, but then again, maybe not. Or his mother describing his father's corpse as so frail and withered that they had to stuff his coffin with cotton balls to keep him from rattling around. If these outrageous moments are missed or unappreciated, I can maybe understand someone mistaking this film for an overly serious self indulgent bore. But Charlie is not such a simple, dull man. He never has been in the past and he certainly isn't here. Synecdoche, NY will haunt the consciousness of any truly considerate film goer. Charlie Kaufman's herculean achievement surpasses nearly every standard by which we ascribe superiority to art. It is astounding."
169,"Synecdoche, New York",8,19 January 2011,"Good acting, good production values, good movie.","A theater director, middle aged, is going from bad to worse in terms of health scares which ominously remain non-fatal, his wife is disappointed in him; his little daughter is a spot of sunshine for him. The movie floats ahead in time, months, seasons at a jump, and his ambitious, magnum-opus-feel play (afforded to him by the MacArthur grant he wins) takes on qualities of his own life even as he craves two women in succession. A well-meaning stalker of the protagonist auditions for the role of Caden (the protagonist, played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman), and is accepted. From this point on, Caden's life takes on drastic changes; the loss of his parents in uncomfortable ways, the total degradation his daughter has been led into by a lover of his wife; a breakdown of his second marriage...yet he exists.That, for me, is the point of this movie: you are your own to deal with, and no matter how you wish things were different or regret your mistakes, in the end you have to deal with them alone."
170,"Synecdoche, New York",8,19 January 2011,Celluloid Maze,"Like an IQ test with a strict time limit, Synechdoche, NewYork displaces every valence electron from out of your brain. To keep pace with it in first viewing, you need all that mental energy and more. Charlie Kaufman had already written films like Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind before directing this one. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a theater director called Caden Cotard. But the trick is, he plays not just one person, and Caden Cotard is not played by just one person. To further crash this film out in the linearity graph, so are many other characters played by many others and many others play many others. In some way, the dictionary suggests, this might be the key to the meaning of the word, Synechdoche.It is futile to review this film as to what it is about. A more important review would be of what it takes to see (or sit through) it. I found it thoroughly enjoyable, which meant the problem of ""sitting through"" never bothered. From some of the opinions expressed in various websites, I take it that it was a serious problem for many. Maybe they had popcorn in one hand. It will never work: a combination of popcorn and this film. It is also not a candidate for serious art-house film study, I'd think. At best, like Sherlock Holmes solving his next case, you need to be able to deduce and be absolutely engrossed. There might be clues here and clues there, but unlike Sherlock, be aware that you could be on a completely different case with each clue. Far from an action film it may be, but Syncechdoche is frenetic. The ""twists and turns"" here are not in the narrative as Kaufman plays with time and imagination. Another key to my enjoying the movie could have been the long efforts I put in to read My Name is Red, Orhan Pamuk's famous novel. After months of attempts, I am still only 10% through it. It is not the most straightforward book, but it isn't a cryptic crossword either. For some reason, I simply couldn't get through it in a normal way. And soon after one such attempted read, I switched to Synechdoche and it felt like a more solvable mystery. So maybe you want to try reading Glass Bead Game before watching to just warm yourself up. The ultimate satisfaction of Synechdoche for the viewer would possibly be the different outcomes of reaction after each viewing. A second review would be so much different to the first or the third. That could be the outstanding quality of this film."
171,"Synecdoche, New York",10,20 December 2010,A Must FIlm To Watch Before You Die,"Kauffman,if you ask me, is comparable to Ingmar Burgman, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un_Chien_Andalou)....In all his works Kauffman has only one Subject, ""The Mind"", and only one plot, how the mind negotiates with reality, fantasy, hallucination, Desire and Dreams. ""Being John Malkovich"" ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind."" ""Adaptation."" ""Human Nature"" ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."" all of these movies just kill you piece by piece! how could a screen writer even Imagine to portray something like these, something of such huge magnitude in way so humble and quiet that only YOU can understand them. When I first watched it, I wanted to watch it again, not because it was difficult to comprehend but I felt I didn't grasp everything what he tried to portray , I watched it the third time because I needed to,and another time because I wanted toBadly.The movie was wildly ambitious ,sprawling, awe-inspiring, heartbreaking, frustrating, achingly and achingly Sad.The whole week, I was in a state of transgression, muted by my own conscienceI felt daunted,indicted by every thing I did and was doingand soon did i realize that this not my faddish facet rather a Longtime ""Souvenir"" of my ""post-synecdoche"" time ...... read the rest of it here... www.perfecterrors.blogspot.com"
172,"Synecdoche, New York",8,3 November 2010,Not Recommended (or maybe yes),"this review contains one spoiler, the only possible one i can think of:the title of the film is pronounced /sɪˈnɛkdəkiː/ (see-neck-dock-e). there, end spoilers. after this i can't, for the life of me, think of a way of possibly spoiling the film for you; the plot is relatively easy to explain, the contents of the film aren't.Synecdoche is a theatre piece, and Seymour Phillip Hoffman is currently the best actor our species has, but i discourage you from watching the film (belive me, his career won't be negatively affected), unless you know exactly what you'r getting yourself in already;I don't consider myself dumb, but on this occasion, i was completely overwhelmed. Imagine someone who doesn't like science fiction trying to enjoy Dune, or someone who doesn't like zombie movies enjoy La Horde.If your are in for a really strong, devastatingly strong portrait of human existential drama, go for it, but otherwise, run away, as a ten year old kid would run away from the dentist, as Synecdoche, Ney York is simply too much.my vote, for the film being astounding in its scope yet so impossible to reach, 8/10 (SPH doesn't even register on the scale.. this is way above and beyond anything he's ever done before)"
173,"Synecdoche, New York",,4 July 2010,Caden is mentally ill !,"I think that Synecdoche, New York is a story of a man, Caden Cotard a theater director who lost touch of the real world. Because of his illness that makes him unable to be a proper family-man his wife Adele takes his daughter who suffers anal cancer and leaves for Germany. The main reason that Adele goes to Germany is in order to provide for their daughter 'Alternative' Cancer Treatment which is not approved in the US. Time passes by and Caden becomes lonely, he is depressed, he feels that nobody ever loved him and that leads to psychological illness acts and beliefs were also continuous different kind of ticks appears. His lack of self-confidence and low self-esteem because of his low profile character drives him insane. By not facing the reality, he tries to figure out a reason why Adele abandoned him. He thinks she maybe was a lesbian and had a relationship with Maria, the friend who were smoking pot together. He also believes he was not a man enough for her.So almost everything shown in the film after his wife Adele left, are inside his paranoid imagination. Each person he used to know or saw is dragged inside his mind and becomes reality by his rules. I tend to believe that the figure of Sammy, is his dead father who he also feels guilts for abandoned him to die.Synecdoche, New York is a brilliant movie touching in all senses the human nature of the 21st century society which faces great problems. The final scene in the movie shows the ultimate search of Caden's consolation, for the life he lost. He is not actually old, he hasn't got anything to live for."
174,"Synecdoche, New York",7,29 April 2010,"Interesting, but it did not leave me completely satisfied","The great screenwriter Charlie Kaufman surprised everyone with the ingenious movies Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (let's forget about Human Nature for a moment).By chance or by destiny, they were made by directors whose unique vision complemented Kaufman's exotic sensibility.What result do we have in Synecdoche, New York, in which Kaufman had absolute control on the material, since he did not only write it but also directed it? The answer: interesting, but pretentious and not completely satisfactory.Synecdoche, New York is definitely not an accessible movie.However, the brilliant performances made me to be interested in the movie, and they made the assimilation of the digressions and changes of perspective from the complex story easier for me.I guess that the actors in Hollywood do not receive roles like the ones from this movie too often, something which might explain the ensemble of excellent actors Kaufman recruited, composed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Tom Noonan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Dianne Wiest, Samantha Morton, Michelle Williams, Hope Davis and Emily Watson.I also liked Kaufman's precise direction.However, his work as a screenwriter was not at the same level.I will explain myself.I do not know whether Synecdoche, New York is one of those pretentious and indulgent movies which analyze the mature age on their dysfunctional characters...or if it is a parody of those pretentious and indulgent whims.The point is that is that I could not realize what Kaufman was trying to say.It may sound weird, but I found Synecdoche, New York to be simultaneously interesting, hollow, deep, pretentious and occasionally boring.I liked the experience in general, but I think that with less pretension and more focus, Kaufman would have gotten a better result with this film.I do not know if I can recommend it to everyone, specially to the casual spectator, because this is not a precisely easy movie."
175,"Synecdoche, New York",,4 January 2010,A film about - but not necessarily for - everyone.,"I was once asked by a friend of mine, struggling to see any real substance or point within this film, why it is held with such esteem by certain people.Perhaps, like much of Kaufman's work, this is truly great only on the condition that you believe it succeeded in conveying and capturing the themes presented throughout in a manner that connected with you on a personal level. If you believe it lacked substance or even direction, then there's no real way you'd ever be able to even objectively call it a great film, much less find any meaning or enjoyment out of it.For me it is great because it conveys, in a philosophical yet easy-to-understand way, the fears and anxieties many of us share about life, death, and how meaningless it all appears to be. It's all laid out for us in a blatantly obvious metaphor of life as a play, with each of us playing our own part. It makes a bold and basically impossible attempt to 'give everyone their due' and essentially fails on purpose, highlighting Caden's (and as a result, our) own sense of subjective meaning. We are here and then we die, but it is our own perception of what we experience that ultimately matters and shapes our supposed reality."
176,"Synecdoche, New York",6,22 December 2009,A Mess Of Brilliance,"I guess I am too simple to like this movie. It was too long and we got the drift about 4 hours into the 2 hour movie. I did like the way he played upon the similar looks of the actors playing copies of themselves. The smoke inhalation pay off was also pretty funny. The only thing I have a problem with is the fact that the writer assumes we want to take this trip with him. I loved ""Being John Malkovich"" but this was a brilliant writer's Ishtar. It had all the right elements, all the right stars, but the story was too far reaching to no where. I know he (Kaufman) questions his existence and is somehow trying to find God in all of his black comedies, but he becomes God in this one. Hoffman is always fun to watch but this is a burning house."
177,"Synecdoche, New York",7,20 September 2009,Most Depressing Movie I've Ever Seen,"This is probably the most depressing movie I've ever seen. Most sad movies have at least some sort of hopeful message, or some sort of moment at the end that gives a sense of hope. Not this one. The guy's life is juts one disaster after another. Every moment of happiness is followed by a horrible tragedy. And there is seemingly no end to this poor guy's pain, just further decay as you watch him get older, and you watch the city around him also decay into a slum (a reflection I assume).There is no hope to be found in this movie, and it is almost relentlessly unwatchable as a result. That's not to say it was a bad movie, but I didn't really see what the point of the movie was. Actually, I take that back, there is a bit of a message at the end, I won't spoil it but it definitely reinforces the pointlessness of it all. This is definitely not a movie to see when you're depressed as it will hit you hard, but it will also make you think, which is not a bad thing. It is deeply affecting and quite a breathtaking experience that you will not soon forget.The acting, the visuals, the dialog are all fantastic. It's a very well made movie technically. You could tell that they put 100% in to making this the best work of art they could. But is it a good story? That's up for debate. I'm just not sure the movie had a real message. Or if it did have a message, it certainly wasn't a positive one. Don't watch this movie depressed, it may push you over the edge."
178,"Synecdoche, New York",6,13 September 2009,like a Jackson Pollock...,"I read a Jackson Pollock quote somewhere. When questioned about the purpose of his paintings, he stated - to paraphrase - that you don't feel a need to interrogate why you find a flower bed beautiful, you just recognize it as aesthetically pleasing. The colors of the daffodils act as a visual metaphor, evoking such-and-such emotion. His compositions were similarly fragmented, yet organic. 'Synecdoche, New York' is very rare because Charlie Kaufman had the clout to persuade a major motion picture studio to back this amorphous bolus of emotion. I don't think I've ever been this affected by a film that doesn't make strict narrative sense..."
179,"Synecdoche, New York",9,19 July 2009,"A powerful blow to one's mind, heart and soul.","As all Kaufman works this one is also a strange one and not intended to be liked by everyone. All I can say is it struck me and pierced my soul. In the end I felt as if my heart broke. A really powerful, touching and beautiful story. Love, death, relationships, eternity, meaning of live, parenthood, imagination, art - so many topics! And Charlie somehow managed to cover them all really well. Maybe because they are the same thing after all? This movie may be a dangerous one to someone who's feelings are exposed at the moment. It really makes you think about the insignificance of human existence. If you feel depressed don't watch it. A masterpiece."
180,"Synecdoche, New York",,13 July 2009,The single most powerful film of the decade,"Synecdoche, New York is not for everyone. Of course it is not, and it is one of the most daring, ambitious, and unique films ever made. It is one of those rare films that come almost once every 10 years. Well, here it is. Words cannot explain this plot, or how I feel about it. The writing is powerful, and very challenging. Charlie Kaufman proves with this that he is the most original director working today. In his directorial debut, he refuses to be anything other than difficult, and that is why I loved this film. Even though it is hard to understand all of it, you still get the message that Kaufman makes. Together with the incredible performances from the whole cast (Hoffman is spectacular, Morton is masterful, Keener and Williams are strong), he directs with confidence and majesty. This is one truly powerful film that goes above and beyond. How everything was snubbed at the Oscars, from the acting, direction, writing, to the powerful editing and score I will never know. But this is one true character study that will become an iconic film in the future, I am sure of that. It might just be THE film of the decade, certainly one of the best films ever made. I loved Eternal Sunshine, but I strongly think that this is Kaufman's Masterpiece"
181,"Synecdoche, New York",6,18 May 2009,not THAT good,"Here is Kaufman's first directing effort, and, not surprisingly, a fall-short effort it is. I can understand that some of the painful slowness of the film might have been for purpose, but it just manifested as a big turnoff for me. I ended up too spaced out to take much of anything from this.The state of This is also a very typical first-director's-work-on-their-own-script, since a lot of scenes could have been cut out. And the whole Ouroboros theme is very typical of Kaufman. Brings me back to Adaptation. There is also scant technique, without much separating the parts of the story save Hoffman's makeup.I will say that what message there was, it was good. Very bold meditation on how we live our lives, about the things that we miss because we're too busy focused on a search for meaning.Overall, I think this film is good, but could have been great if left up to a more experienced director. Oh yeah, and I still don't get why Hazel's house is eternally on fire."
182,"Synecdoche, New York",,29 April 2009,"Seen ""Synecdoche, New York"" at CPH:PIX film festival","Wow. I was fearin seeing this movie because I loved adaptation so much and thought I would get disappointed. But boy oh boy was I wrong and did I enjoy it. This is Kaufmans first movie being a director. This is a great character study of man in great pain inside.A great study on writers and the characters they play and maybe on life? OK, thats taking it too far, but it was moving stuff! Philip S Hoffmann is the greatest actor of the modern generation so i was expecting a brilliant perfromance and was not let down, hmmm, maybe he even played it too subtle, am, no, I liked it!!! The movie has some woderfully weird moments, that some dudes might think is pretesious but I just love - like reading a book out loaud on the plane and it happening as he read its. Love those kind of scenes! The movie is downbeat and quite depressing but hey most of Kaufmans films are like this in one way or another, this was along film, but not many fell asleep and were glued to his wonderfully quirky story of a strange egotistical auther. the ending came out of no where, i was wondering how they would end it and I found it very very well done -open to opinion, how i like it.

Independent films are sometimes excellent as this one is, but it requires a lot of work to appreciate the excellence. This will not be for everyone because you can't multitask while watching. It demands your full attention.There is no simple explanation of what is going on. Each person will take what they want from it, and multiple watching will give you more. You may or may not appreciate the fact that writer/director Kaufman appears to say that we are alone in the world; that life's meaning is supplied by you as you deal with loneliness, hopelessness, confusion, and the fear of death; and there is no great truth.So, stop trying to figure out what it all means and live your life.This is truly an ensemble performance. All the actors played brilliantly and the fact that they were displayed with all their imperfections added to the film.Maybe Kaufman tried to do too much with this film. I will leave that to others, as it is the first film of his I have seen."
184,"Synecdoche, New York",10,25 November 2008,A new breed of dark comedy,"Movie of the year, no questions asked. Drills straight into your psyche, scares the f*ck out of you - and I mean scares you psychologically and permanently, none of that jumping in your seat bullshit. Do you fear disease? Do you fear death? Do you fear losing the people you love? Do you fear growing older? Do you fear losing YOURSELF? Watch this movie and watch all of these fears unravel and come true for one man in light speed. Philip Seymour Hoffman is disgustingly perfect as always - and the rest of the cast was chosen correctly as well. Not a single performance is the least bit off kilter. The movie starts moving slow then twists and twists and twists until all of a sudden you don't know where you are and your hair is turning gray. This movie is purely about reality. Living one lifetime. Utterly depressing. Depression causes weight loss. Michelle Williams looks the best she ever has. See it however you can. It's NOT OPTIONAL. This is a NEW BREED of DARK COMEDY. The comedy is so dark, it's NOT FUNNY! MOVIE OF THE YEAR."
185,"Synecdoche, New York",10,7 November 2008,This is brilliant but don't leave your mind at home now that it's spotless.,"I enjoyed this film very much; it reminded me of Kurt Vonnegut, in a way, with characters asking the author/director what is going on and what the plot is about as the author is not only directing the play, he is actually writing and directing their lives; there are other people who play the author too and quite a few people play the same woman in his life as the play he is trying to produce is autobiographical; it has to be, I suppose, if it is real. There were times, I have to confess, when I couldn't tell the difference between Emily Watson and Samantha Morton. There is a lot of talk about the author/director's bowels and we see the terrible colors of his feces and urine and the pustules on his body whilst on the radio there are news items about arthritis and the billion dollar payout by drug companies to patients. The author/director takes handfuls of arthritis pills and as the movie progresses he finds it harder and harder to walk, think in a straight line or even exist. Early on a faucet bursts as he is shaving and a piece of piping cuts his head and he needs stitches; so we can see, throughout the movie, where in time we are, when Charlie Kauffman jumps about, in this non-linear movie, by the progress of the scar and we can also see this by his hair: sometimes he is going bald, sometimes he is bald then suddenly he has a full head of hair; a bit like the hair color of Kate Winslet in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' which changed frequently giving the viewer a clue as to what stage in real time the scenes were actually taking place. Indeed, there is a strong similarity between 'Synecdoche, New York' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' with the same kind of mood music which gave the scenes extra meaning but the greatest thing about this movie is the performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman in the central role of the author/director Caden Cotard; this is a tour de force and puts his Oscar winning performance as Truman Capote to shame. I said it reminded me of Kurt Vonnegut and, indeed, there is a character who appears in the background of early scenes who appears to be stalking Caden Cotard who reminded me of Billy Pilgrim from 'Slaughterhouse Five' and one of the lines in the movie by Samantha Morton, to her date, is 'Do you like Beaver?'This is my impression after seeing the movie once; I suspect I will have to see it again to fully understand it and maybe then I will have a different take  I could be totally wrong."
186,"Synecdoche, New York",10,7 April 2009,"One of the best movies ever made, although very hallucinatory and sad. Will likely induce nightmares, epiphanies, and suicidal thoughts.","That's about it. The movie follows a moment or two every few years in the life of Philip Seymour Hoffman's somewhat tortured playwright. All of the performances in the film were great. The writing here was circular but brilliant. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Charlie Kaufman must do a ton of LSD (in fact I read here that the film was like a bad LSD trip, which I completely agree with). This is an actor's movie, a playwright's movie, but also an easily accessible film for the masses. Warning: this movie is funny and hallucinatory, but also very, very sad. Although there are no suicides in the film, it is definitely not for the potentially suicidal. Seriously. I'd never say that about anything else I've ever seen. Watching this movie is like that Stephen King short story from the 1980s about long-distance space travel wherein a person stays awake (they are supposed to be unconscious and sees EVERYTHING and perceives/experiences eternity, which drives him irrevocably insane: you will never see the world the same way or be the same person again."
187,"Synecdoche, New York",7,15 November 2008,Quite possibly one of the most frightening movies ever made,"I've been a fan of Kaufman's scripts since before most of them were made into halfway decent pop-art by directors who seemed to have some difficulty juggling the writer's magic realism with commercial accessibility. This, being Kaufman's directorial debut, is truly the first Charlie Kaufman film that I can see- -short of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, which seemed to play rather close to the original text--in which I was able to truly lose myself, without the distraction of music by the Strokes or tacky advertorial moments from nowhere. Though far from perfect, Kaufman's effort here is probably the first movie of the year I've seen, perhaps the first in a few years, where I felt myself drifting off, transcending really, coming to a place where even if I didn't fully understand where I was, it didn't matter. Jon Brion's ethereal score, and the sensational acting on everyone's part was a big help, but I think it had more to do with the fact that Kaufman himself seemed to allow himself the same kind of freedom in the creating of said picture.Admittedly, there were times where the film fell flat--namely in the beginning--and some scenes dragged-on needlessly (as though Kaufman found himself a cute joke and decided to stretch it as long as it could go, sometimes even after the elastic had snapped), but overall, by the last half of the film, I was able to let go and allow the writer/director to steer the boat, even when he decided to crash it more than once along the way.Still struggling with whether or not I actually liked the film, I left the theater and stepped into the cinema's corridor to find myself in a state that was mind-boggling and confusing. There were people walking by me saying things I couldn't understand, there were posters up on the walls that were placed there by people I'll never meet. Walking outside the theater, there was construction, more people in mid-conversation milling by, more advertisements placed there before I ever got there, buildings, an entire clockwork world that enmeshed me in some kind of network I couldn't fathom. It's a shame that it might be considered neotenous of me to say, but I can only liken the effect to the peaking one feels on mushrooms. As with the movie, I don't know if I enjoyed the feeling or not, but I can't deny that the horripilation sensation wouldn't go away and stuck with me while I wandered the downtown area in a strange reverie that became more frightening as time went on. I didn't want to call anyone I know to tell them about the experience--just as one sometimes chooses to remain alienated and isolated whilst on mind-altering drugs--and I couldn't tell if I needed a hug or wanted to read a book. It was odd, to be sure, and all I could think was that I was glad I saw the movie alone, I was glad I knew nothing about it before seeing it, and I was glad I had seen it all. Is it a good movie? Hard to say. Definitely not without its flaws. But, as with a serious mind trip, probably something you might want to try at least once. Of course, most people probably won't get it, and those who do may very well end up as existentially frightened as I.Don't worry, I'm better now."
188,"Synecdoche, New York",10,1 March 2009,"The end is built into the beginning  Synecdoche, New York","We all go about our lives creating a world around us. To us, we are the stars of a film; our surroundings are the set; and the people touching our lives supporting players and/or extras. Philip Seymour Hoffman's Caden Cotard watches as the plays he directs onstage succeed and garner praise while the life he lives with wife and daughter falls apart around him. As a God, crafting the activities and molding the characterizations of a cast, his own humanity is lost and hidden behind an insecure and scared shell of a man. We do audition the people we hold dear; they must pass a test before we allow them in our lives. Some go on to play bigger roles while others get fired for not doing their job. We raise our children and build them into what we feel a child should be, shaping them to grow up and succeed. It is all carefully orchestrated in the movie of our life, but until you realize that the extras in your story are the leads in their own, you will never be truly happy. Each one will become more famous and sought after, bringing their show to Broadway and Hollywood, hitching a ride on a new director's coattails, while you stay, stuck and alone, going through the motions in your abandoned back-lot, eternally in Synecdoche, New York.I didn't quite know what to expect when delving into this film. At first, it all seemed pretty much rooted in a reality, a slightly heightened one, but still accessible. Cotard was living a life of convenience with his regretful artist wife Adele, (Catherine Keener), and their annoyingly hyper daughter Olive. We begin to catch glimpses of the deterioration of his surroundings as words start to confuseOphthalmologist sounds like Neurologist which sounds like Urologist; when speaking of suicide, ""How would you do it"" sounds like ""How did you do it"", etcand eventually all footing is lost when Samantha Morton's Hazel buys a house on fire. It appears to be a gag as she speaks of being afraid she might die in the flames, yet as the film continues on, the home is constantly burning, possibly showing her role as devil to Cotard, the ever-alluring vixen he so wants, but can never build the courage to be with.The acting is brilliant across the board, from the large roles to the small. Jennifer Jason Leigh's mysterious Maria becomes a fully fleshed creature, a destructive force in Cotard's life while only being on screen for maybe five total minutes. She takes away his wife and then his daughter, becoming a surrogate for himself in Berlin, the place he was not allowed to follow them to. She, in effect, becomes the first cast member in the life of Caden Cotard; the stand-in for him as he must stay back to work on his MacArthur grant producing masterpiece. The story becomes more and more surreal at this point, Seymour Hoffman's portrayal becoming more eccentric and crazed with nervous ticks and medical problems cropping up one after another. Time begins to fold in on itself as the years pass by, but seem as only days or weeks to him. A wife and child gone for a year yet he only misses them for a week, thinking they will return once the show overseas has completed. The real world and that of his play, reinterpreting it, meld together into one.More and more layers are created as we get Emily Watson cast as Hazel, in the play being written, while the real-life Hazel (Morton) goes on continuing her journey with Hoffman's Caden. Even Cotard himself begins to play the character of Ellen, a housekeeper for the real-life Adele, who then becomes a character cast with Dianne Wiest in the story. Probably my second favorite move by Kaufman, having a character created for a fictional person, to then eventually be played by Caden again, revisiting the role for which he originated, a person who does not exist on any plain whatsoever  genius. I say second favorite, though, because I absolutely loved the character of Tom Noonan's Sammy Barnathan. He is ever-present throughout the entire film, seen in the background, watching intently. From the first scene, standing across the street as Hoffman gets his mail, to the shadowed blur in front of the camera as he creeps out from behind a tree when Hoffman meets his muse in actress Claire, (Michelle Williams), at a park bench. He is always there, watching and waiting, until the time comes that Caden needs an actor to play himself. How can he give notes on his own character if he cannot see what he is doing? The only way to improve is to put him into the elaborate play himself, to watch his insecurities and greed firsthand, to acknowledge the error of his ways. However, he is so vapid and egomaniacal that he becomes jealous of the characters themselves.Only when Wiest's Millicent Weems takes the job of playing the real Cadenthat's right, the REAL Cadendoes he finally get a break to put his whole self into the part of Ellen. He decides to hide inside his own play, all those he loved dead and gone, while Wiest tells him the story of her own life as an actress, eerily similar to his. It all spirals out of control, as Cotard himself can't remember what happened in his past to bring him to where he has ended up. By the time the ending comes, you really won't know if anything you've seen actually happened. However, the final cue, the final note, if you will, given to Hoffman's ""real"" Caden Cotard as Ellen Bascomb, couldn't be more profound in its simplicity. He has needed to be told what to do at every step of his existence, so it is only appropriate that he is told when he can finally take that much-deserved rest."
189,"Synecdoche, New York",8,25 February 2009,Remember part of me is you,"Is this a great movie? Sure. Would I want to see it again anytime soon? Hell no. First of all it's deeply confusing, even by the standards of a Charlie Kaufman movie. It's also exceedingly sad throughout, starting low and going lower, from blue to black to bleak. But most importantly, it's really very long. It feels like a one-hour movie with a two-hour ending, but maybe that's ""because the end is built into the beginning."" An out-of-luck playwright and a henpecked husband, Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffmann) receives a prestigious scholarship, the kind Hoffmann's character in ""The Savages"" never got. Of course money changes everything, and of course it's for the worse. Endowed with the means to live his dream and produce the ultimate drama, Caden embarks on a journey from which he will not return. Working all departments, he is creating something so vast it will eventually swallow everything. Slowly, but irreversibly the production spins out of proportion and control. Scope and set are ever expanding. Casual comments turn into story lines and backdrops into locations. Onlookers and bystanders become part of the play, until everybody is in it and no-one is left to watch. The play becomes Caden's life, until his life is finally nothing but the play. It's the play to end all plays, the true Truman Show, a theater of the world as envisioned by Pedro Calderón himself. Quote Caden in his directorial persona: ""You're in the scene, you're not just filming it."" No doubt this is a masterpiece, but it's also Charlie Kaufman's darkest and most depressing movie to date."

Borderline nails-on-a-chalkboard oddity from 'genius' scribe Charlie Kaufman's equally off-beat mindset (and his directorial debut to boot) about a schlumpy playwright (Hoffman) whose introspection of his failed life in general causes grist for the mill of meta proportions when his deemed MacArthur grant allows him to pursue his ultimate story: a play in real-time about himself!

192,"Synecdoche, New York",7,11 November 2008,Kaufman's 8 ½,"Granted, not as much fun to watch as Fellini's famous quasi-autobiographical opus, but it's essentially the same thing: Man involved in the lively arts hits a creative block while attempting to deal with the women in his life, in realistic and surrealistic episodes of varying degrees covering his entire life.All of Fellini's 8 ½ is here:- the sickness, the women, the creative process, the enormous set, the dreamlike spells of surrealism, the existentialism, the bits of wild humor, the stark drama ... only Kaufman substitutes grit, grime, ugliness, repulsion and paranoia for Fellini's glitz, glamour, beauty, charm and euphoria.It's about a quarter of an hour shorter than 8 ½, but feels twice as long  and there's no Barbara Steele, of course  but Philip Seymour Hoffman and the rest of the cast are fantastic."
193,"Synecdoche, New York",,19 August 2015,Can't figure out why people love it...,"I saw this movie and after about an hour and 5 min I stopped. I have read reviews about this movie, felt like worth watching, but in the end I got too confused over what's going on. Let me just start by saying that I giggled maybe twice during the first hour... Other than that, I can't think of a reason to give this movie a 7.5 rating. Now let me explain what I got all confused about: I could barely knew anything about all the characters involved in the movie, The directing made the film even MORE confusing for me, a lot of things happened but I couldn't care enough for them because the movie was pretty much salad filled with things happening and I found myself asking myself about 5 times: ''W-what ?...'' In conclusion, this movie get a 4/10 rating. While I got all confused and wasn't entertained by this film, I still found myself being able to stay and try to watch until the end."
194,"Synecdoche, New York",10,12 June 2013,10 out of 10 is a rating that I seldom tag to a film. But this film has earned it.,"When I initially watched this movie, I glanced over important details and failed to direct my attention in its entirely to the film. At the time, the editing sequences felt pretty unnatural to a casual cinema viewer like myself, and consequently I couldn't perceive the film for what it was because of a profusion of scanty distractions. However, my second viewing could only be described as an epitome of mass distinction and magnificence. The only adjusting I had done during the viewing was fortifying my intention to focus on what was really going on in the movie. Ultimately, the focus was notably rewarded. I gained a lot of great impressions with this movie. This film is essentially an abbreviated capture of life. Don't be deferred by this movie even if it doesn't settle with your regular tastes. Instead, absorb it as you would anything else. Be awake, observant and you will be more than satisfied."
195,"Synecdoche, New York",9,6 January 2012,"Synecdoche, New York (2008)","Kaufman has always split me down the middle. He's a wonderful writer at times, but sometimes his vision hasn't had the best representation (I found Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind incredibly overrated). Due to the very mixed reviews, I was able to approach this film with no idea of what to expect. At times confusing, at times obvious, but always interesting Synecdoche, New York, is one of the most honest depictions of life put to film. Kaufman handles the complex narrative structure very well. There are some fantastic scenes, where we see a play within a play, and that play reflects more of real life than life itself. Hoffman learns to look at himself but also those around him. Hoffman tries to recreate his own life, but it becomes a never ending process. Perhaps one of the (minor) failures of the film itself. I found this to be touching and truthful, but it certainly isn't going to find universal acclaim."
196,"Synecdoche, New York",10,19 September 2010,Kaufman speaks honestly,"Some people who dislike Synecdoche, New York, consider that this film is self-indulgent and pretentious. Some also describe it as nothing but an artistic masturbation. I reckon that the seemingly uncontrollable surge of symbolism, the inexplicable connection between a symbol and another, and the hazy theme of the film have a major part in generating the negative reception. Nevertheless, the aversive outlook is a misjudgment of the film and could mislead potential viewers. In my opinion, Synecdoche, New York is far from so-called artistic masturbation. In fact, this film is truthful in its narration and delivering of its ideas. It is not trying to be complicated and artsy in order to be complicated and artsy. It is neither a shenanigan from a naughty artist who already has a big name with the object of pleasing himself.Those who have seen and enjoyed Kaufman's previous works can understand that he likes to scrutinize his own mind (and ours in process). We can see how he longs for the understanding of his mind, which he seems to believe holding the key to understanding the world or maybe to coming closer to the truth. This explains the themes he often uses in his works; the concept of soul in Being John Malkovich, the adaptation of the mind to the well-constructed representation of reality in Adaptation, and the meaning of identity and being in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.Unlike in his prior work, Adaptation, Kaufman doesn't try to ""play"" in Synecdoche, New York. I don't refer to his using of his alter egos in Adaptation, but to the way he plays with his ideas (Btw, I love that well-executed playfulness of his in Adaptation). In Synecdoche, New York, he doesn't leave the second half of his script to Donald Kaufman (although that's how he stays faithful to the main theme of Adaptation). He also doesn't bail on ideas he has put forward in order to wrap the ideas with the main idea he intended to make. This time, Kaufman is very patient in exploring and dwelling in his labyrinthine mind without taking a glance at the seduction of his playfulness (maybe a little bit). It is a long and painful road he's taking. However, this road doesn't lead to any certain conclusion. Yet, it is neither a journey into the abyss of nothingness.Synecdoche, New York is purely philosophical but without neglecting the aesthetic value and entertaining elements for audience to enjoy. It seeks to find the ultimate reality by using established philosophical notions (especially post-modernists' ideas about ultimate reality and meaning). Nevertheless, it doesn't merely borrow the notions. It puts them into a test and shows us how they work. It focuses on a process of how the ideas of schools of philosophy emerge. We can see how Caden (powerfully played by Hoffman) tries to recreate reality in order to see and understand the meaning of his life, but more importantly the nature of meaning itself that raises questions such as: can we really hold it with our minds? Is it something that exists only in the horizon of endless ocean? Or does it really exist? Which one is real, meaning or the signifier? Which one is the first, meaning or the thing that represents it? And how can a signifier of certain meaning produce several meanings that generate new meanings in order to repeat the same process? In the end, after bopping around from one metaphysical idea to another (from the belief that a sign constitutes a meaningmetaphysical presenceto the impossible existence of meaning, from the idea about the world that represents nothing but the representation of signs with many layers of signs to the idea about interpolating signifiers into other signifiers that causes the lost of meaning ), this film, in the same perspective with Derrida, asserts that ultimate reality and meaning may exist but to find them is an eternal search.I know that it is reductive to sum up a movie that is emotionally powerful and schools of philosophy that have rich histories and ideas just in a few sentences. And i'm aware that my perspective and short analysis on this film may not be true but it's just one of possible ways to see it. Moreover, these metaphysical and philosophical understandings are useless if one cannot enjoy the film and feel captured by it.However, if you are not familiar with postmodern philosophy you are still able to identify with characters' confusion, agony, and anguish. Synecdoche, New York is so powerful in transferring its dark, gloomy, and mysterious emotions that will leave you with almost unbearable feelings. You will feel exhausted but grateful for it. This film will stay in your head for days. You will feel that this film talks to you in a strange language that you can't fully comprehend. Yet, you are sure that you completely understand it although it is hard for you to articulate your understanding.10/10"

198,"Synecdoche, New York",9,7 June 2010,Beautiful. Art in its purest form.,"Words cannot describe the depths that this movie has reached, not only within the layers of meaning, but within the human soul. This brilliant piece of film MUST receive more than one viewing to fully understand.Taking place in Schenectady, New York, it encircles the latter half of Caden Cotard's life as he attempts to make a theater piece unmatched by any other. He incorporates elements of his own life into the piece, and begins to blur the line between what is real and what is part of his masterpiece.The movie is absolutely surreal. A LOT is for artistic effect, such as an impossibly large warehouse, a burning building that someone lives in, or others. But they all make sense and contribute to the intricate plot in some way.The first time you watch this movie, you will most likely understand very little. However, either watch the film again or spend some time on this board, and it will all come together to form a completely unforgettable cinematic masterpiece."
199,"Synecdoche, New York",10,6 May 2010,Could be the best film I've ever seen,"This was an absolute masterpiece. Charlie Kaufman is what you'd get if you threw Woody Allen, Spike Jonze, and Sam Mendes in a blender. Synecdoche New York is a beautiful, enthralling, grand film that was one of the most phenomenal that I've ever seen.I'm not going to tell you the plot because it is quite simply too much to put into a IMDb review. Very original, and I found myself drawn to all of the characters. That doesn't happen very often these days. Too often we get a 3-D mess, completely without character development or story. So it was good to see a film with a lot of green screen that had good characters and a good story.The acting is great. Hoffman turns in his usual Oscar worthy performance here. We also have Catherine Keener, Samantha Morton, and Michelle Williams as the female leads, all of which outstanding. Besides Hoffman, the two performances I found Oscar worthy were Tom Noonan's and Dianne Wiest's. Noonan is really underrated, he's a great actor and he's one of the best parts of the movie here. I would've loved a 'Best Supporting Actor' nod from the Academy for his role.Words can barely describe how good this film is. It may require multiple viewings, as was the case of some friends of mine. But don't believe the bad reviews here, Synecdoche New York is a great film."
200,"Synecdoche, New York",10,2 January 2010,One of if not THE best cinematic masterpieces ever.,"Having not really understood much of the ""arty"" side of films for a long time i have recently gotten into this genre more and more and must admit i like it a lot, (the title alone is enough to spark interest in even the ""slowest"" of film minds, being a mainstream film buff mostly i class myself as one of the ""slower"" film minds)....Philip Seymour Hoffman plays his role with perfection and delivers a masterpiece of breathtaking performance...backed up with powerful performances by the rest of the cast.Some parts of the film are still a mystery to me i.e the burning house Hazel lives in?....but i'm sure if you look hard enough there is some reference to it. And the relationship between the Ellen character and Caden himself are baffling if not confusing to anyone....but again the links are there if you look hard enough...this is another one of those films you just have to watch several times before all the links fall into place and the movie makes sense. Recently i've watched a couple of movies in the same vein i.e Art-house films and would rate them more than any mainstream big budget movie.All in all a must see for anyone with the foresight to enjoy movies for exactly what they are and not for the flashy special effects or massive leading cast that most movie goers enjoy. Hooray for Charlie Kaufman and the cast for delivering such a wonderful piece."
201,"Synecdoche, New York",7,28 October 2009,Heeeeeers Charlie!,"Charlie Kaufman is a great writer of enjoyable multi-layered movies that try to break with convention and keep the audience on its toes. I found Synecdoche a bit predictable, however, and not up to the level of his best work as a screenwriter.The Woody Allen-like angst ridden hypochondriac male protagonist is becoming a bit of a Kaufman cliché, as is the estrangement of male-female relationships and the difficulty of male-female communication. See Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for more of the same.So, much like Woody Allen, the content of the film is no surprise. It was exactly like I expected. Surely for CK this is a bad thing? He used to be Mr. Originality...I must say that I do agree with other reviewers that the first hour is brilliant and for a while I thought I was going to adore this film. The problem is that the film takes place over decades, and in order to get in as much time change as possible, the messing about with time that occurs at the beginning of the film accelerates to an almost unmanageable degree by the second half of the film, making it disconnected, formulaic and boring. The film is so (intentionally) self-referential that it becomes self-indulgent, mirroring the play Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character Caden is directing to such an extent that it becomes just as pointless, with the ending really too predictable. It is telling that the really ambitious part of the film, then, doesn't really work. Its also really depressing. Depressing and boring is never a good combination, the good will built over the first hour almost gone by the time the credits come to our rescue.The acting, however, is uniformly superb, especially the always great PSF and one of our true British stars, Samantha Morton. Even the girl from Dawson's Creek is pretty good. But I think Charlie needs firstly to get a collaborator to work with who can harness his frankly absurdly prodigious talents as a writer, and secondly stop making films that appear to be about caricatures of himself - maybe I'm wrong but it seems that way, and we've seen it all before. The seven I gave it is as much for trying as anything, but the film falls some way short of its lofty ambitions."
202,"Synecdoche, New York",7,31 May 2009,Brave attempt,"You put your left leg in; You put your left leg out; You put your left leg in; And you shake it all about. You do the Synecdoche and you turn yourself around; That's what it's all about.All said and done, Synecdoche is a valiant attempt at portraying the disintegration of a man's life through his inability to identify and live with his own particular differences. Superficially, it is about a man having a nervous breakdown but it is more than that. The title of the film is a giveaway. Nothing is to be taken 'literally', there are metaphors aplenty and this requires some help to unpick. The action appears to be part dream, part reality. Take that as a hint. Here are the dream directory entries for four visual clues used throughout the film:To dream that a house is on fire indicates that you need to undergo some transformation. If you have recurring dreams of your family house on fire, then it suggests that you are still not ready for the change or that you are fighting against the change.To see a mermaid in your dream signifies the female aspect of yourself that is mysterious and secretive. It may also show a fear of sex. In particular, for a man to dream of a mermaid, it indicates that he is having fears of being drowned by the feminine aspect of his psyche.To dream of an illness in your dream, denotes despair, unpleasant changes, or some emotional breakdown. The illness may be symbolic of your inability to cope with a situation and you see that being ill is an easy way out.To dream that you or others are sick denotes discordance and trouble in your life. It may also signal a part of you that needs to be healed, either physically or mentally. Perhaps you are wallowing in your own self-pity. You need to quit feeling sorry for yourself.Why do I mention mermaids? There aren't any shown but the imagery is there from The Little Mermaid story. Look at the therapist's feet. The therapist writes books that are 'mute' yet 'knowing'.If you have difficulty understanding what this film is about, just stand back. Here is a theatre director who cannot direct his own life. Here is a man who appears to have a gender identity disorder. Here is a man trapped inside his own little world that has no reality outside. Here is a man who tries to create a reality that does not exist. Here is a man looking for an authentic voice  one that turns out to be female. We knew that all along  the tragedy is, it takes him too long to learn."
203,"Synecdoche, New York",7,16 May 2009,Speechless.,"I love Charlie Kaufman's work and I want to express all my admiration once again after seeing his first directed flick. It is so rich and complex that you won't waste your time summarising it. It just leaves you speechless. It is never ending, constantly evolving to a further stage, strong and silent like a wave. You just follow its evolution (That's the right word, I wouldn't talk about ""story"") and get yourself comfortably lost. The reason why my vote is not so high after all is a feeling about an incomplete movie. There is way loads of stuff in it (I think everyone may agree) and it ends up creating a bit of fragmentation. The first half of the movie is realistic while the second is totally surreal (The movie lasts 124 minutes). Probably the first part could have been shorter (Even though most of people say that the ending is too long). In the surreal half of the movie the characters are re-played by look-like actors and it takes too long to assume this new ""dimension"". You feel you cannot make it and, while you are still entertained, you loose satisfaction. It's like plugging in a delay-effect on your guitar, you just can't play the same solo. I know Charlie has been able to do better than that and I am referring to ""Human Nature"" that, despite its complexity, goes along sharp and intriguing to the end. I am sure next one would be better and I know there's gonna be another."
204,"Synecdoche, New York",10,13 May 2009,I really cannot understand what people are nagging about,"I went in yesterday and saw the film and I must say I was truly impressed. I think it was very, very good. I read a lot of comments here and I' m, well, baffled. Some people here say it was chaotic, pretentious, incomprehensible, bloated. And some people also claim that it should have been 15 minutes less. I could not disagree more. When you walk into a film you go with expectations right? Like ""this is the new Kauffman film it has to be... well Kauffman"". I try to go without any. And what happens when that person decides to be completely open and honest with himself and with the audience and articulates this confusion in a very organized way? Well he departs from what is, should we say, ""digestible"" to something entirely different.In this film we see a man that forever tries to understand himself, that tries to discover his identity by being a spectator of his own life. To do this he needs to recreate his entire life piece by piece. This is, well, in my opinion symbolic (and it alludes to the simulacra theory of Baudrillard but that is a totally different subject).When you go to therapy you are required to view yourself from the outside and calmly (and truthfully) manage the situation you are in, really learn by past mistakes and really do what is best for you. This is what Caden tries to do. And if the movie is complicated or unintelligible it's because people are complicated and unintelligible. Is your life a linear storyline? Do your dreams have a linear storyline? Mine doesn't.The fact that he cannot reach self-knowledge is because instead of having the self-confidence to realize what is important and what isn't, he concerns himself with triviality - trying to reach such an accurate representation of his life that he cannot exclude what is unneeded. That is why he never gets any closer to knowing himself. And that is what is tragic about this hero. Because he cannot see the fundamental parts of himself. What it is that makes him this way and what makes him act as he does. So it might take him a little more time than we all want to get to the point (if any). But when you try to articulate your true self do you look at your watch and go ""well that took more time than it SHOULD""? How much time SHOULD it take anyone to understand even a little part of himself? All his life maybe?And finally about all the confusing imagery: Everything around this character is a part of him, or sees it through his own eyes if you will. And his eyes decide to put his face on a cartoon hero and put his wife in the pages of a magazine. Is this real? It is for him. And all this represent some part of Caden. Even the burning house - lol"
205,"Synecdoche, New York",9,7 May 2009,Fascinating look at the human experience.,"""I know how to do it now. There are nearly thirteen million people in the world, and none of those people is an extra. They're all leads in their own stories. They have to be given their due."" Do you remember when you were a kid, or more recently, having to deal with a kid who keeps asking, ""And then...?"", and you attempt to rationally continue answering their questions? Synecdoche, New York is a lot like that.Charlie Kaufman has a reputation as being one of the few really distinctive scribes in Hollywood cinema. His scripts for uncoiling, genre-subverting films like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation put him in a select group (with guys like David Mamet or Quentin Tarantino, for instance) that could be considered auteurs without ever having to saddle up behind a camera. Well, now Kaufman has taken the helmer's plunge with Synecdoche, New York, a meditation on life, change and the nature of self that mixes the wickedly fatalistic surrealism of Songs from the Second Floor with the playful identity-shattering of something like Symbiopsychotaxiplasm.It may be hard for some to believe, but Synecdoche is easily Kaufman's most heartfelt, emotional piece yet, because it delves into the complex contradictions of the human experience the only way it possibly can: through metaphor. Never before have I seen a film that attempted so thoroughly to document and catalogue what it means to be human, to live, to think, to be. The film peers over the edge of existence, and does its best to quantify the record of the lifetime, and every time it peels away a layer, it finds another, altogether different layer underneath. It manages to stay nakedly emotional, almost a direct confession from the soul, as it simultaneously reflects these discrepancies by presenting them completed adorned, couching them in symbols and metaphor that cut much more deeply to the heart of the feeling than a direct, linear path could ever do.The fact that this deals with someone of an artistic persuasion murkens the water even more thoroughly because it adds the responsibility and the desire to enrich the world, something that is within most people, but is set to the forefront here, and just as Kaufman is trying to get to the nitty-gritty of his own nature, his characters are dealing with their own natures, and how that nature deals with other people's natures, especially when THEY are attempting to reflect your natures, and perhaps even wrestle control over something, but...see? This is what happens when you try to lay Synecdoche, New York out lengthwise. It's like an intestine, and it goes all the way to China. In fact, I'm sort of amazed he even figured out a place to stop (and really, that's only because he died, and really, that's only because he was told to die, and really...Kaufman's direction is accomplished and sort of off-puttingly perfect for the material. It has a sort of light darkness, a genial gloom, and any other oxymoronic term you can think of that represents a sort of lifelike melding of happy and sad (strikes and gutters, to quote another brilliant screenwriter). Fittingly, his staging is heartfelt and theatrical in its artificiality, and you sometimes lose sight of what is art and what is life, which I'm sure was intentional. The chronology also jumps around quite a bit. Only forward, sure, but inconsistently, and sometimes very abruptly, and I think it sort of symbolizes another facet of life, how some insignificant things seem to linger in the mind substantially longer than more important things, and there's no rhyme or reason to it, but that's how it goes.The film doesn't need it, since the ethos is at the forefront and the center of the attention, but it has a preposterous, almost dream cast. Hoffman is, as always, a revelation, along with his doppelganger, the supremely underpraised Tom Noonan. s in the lives of many men, the women in Cotard (Hoffman)'s life are the dominant power and focus of the piece, and the feminine cast is absolutely gobsmacking: Catherine Keener, Michelle Williams, Samantha Morton, Hope Davis, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Emily Watson, Dianne Wiest? I mean, good lord. A film like Songs from the Second Floor blew me away because I understood on a fundamental level, even if I couldn't explain it rationally. Synecdoche, New York goes, appropriately, one step deeper. I couldn't tell you what it all means, couldn't lay it out in a term paper, or make it so I could write out a synopsis on Wikipedia, but I see what he's doing, and I feel it in my soul. I can't explain how these women doing their little tango into his thoughts, floating in and out of his life, but I GET what they represent. Of the ladies, the most interesting, the most useful, the most damaging is not always in the forefront, but just...going through, flowing in, floating out, passing through the camera lens of the person we happen to be following, one of the billions with their own story. It's sort of like...what's that word? Oh yeah. Life.Glad to be able to say decisively that I have a clear #2 film of 2008. All year, it's been WALL-E and everyone else, a masterpiece and a litany of overachieving ""good"" movies. I might not be ready to slot Synecdoche into my top 300 just yet, but I'm glad to say that little mechanical bastard's finally got some competition.{Grade: 9/10 (A-) / #2 (of 106) of 2008}"
206,"Synecdoche, New York",10,4 May 2009,Brilliant...,"People have said that this movie is confusing, but for me it resonated profoundly. ""Synecdoche"" connected with me in a way no movie ever has before, and I'm sure that it has also done so with many others because it actually succeeds in depicting the common plight of humanity and our need to create art. We all have something deep inside us that we want to release into the world so that it knows we matter. The problem is, we don't always know what that something is. And then when we finally do get a sense of what it is, we struggle to push it to the surface, but we really don't know what will happen once it gets there. In the end it may not even resemble what we wanted it to, and maybe nobody will understand it at all. But we learn to take that risk because, for some of us, self-expression is what life is all about. We'll let it control us and destroy our physical and psychological well-being because our view of the world may outlive us, and because of that, we ultimately will survive. It's amazing, but somehow this movie gets this point across in its very absurdist way. You realize pretty quickly that the movie does not represent reality. Instead, it is an attempt to meld art and reality together so that you cannot tell where one ends and the other begins. It is a picture of the creative process and the way it clashes with life while capturing a little bit, a synecdoche, of that life. In ""Synecdoche,"" Caden Cotard is possessed by an urge to recreate his life in the form of a stage play. While this urge takes shape inside him, he undergoes various physical ailments, for instance blood in his stools. To me this represents the pain one experiences when attempting to externalize something internal. Caden also suffers a great deal in his personal life, and all this suffering serves to allow him to understand life more intimately that he might be able to say more about it. I happened to read the screenplay of this movie before watching it, as I enjoy reading screenplays for fun. (I hope to write one eventually.) Thus nothing puzzled me when I actually watched the movie. I'm sure I might have had a different experience if I hadn't read the screenplay beforehand. ""Synecdoche, New York"" can be a bit complicated. But is there an easy way to convey the complexities of our lives? An easier way would not be as satisfying, and for me, ""Synecdoche"" was incredibly satisfying. If you have art in your soul, I strongly recommend this movie. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will be mysteriously moved."
207,"Synecdoche, New York",10,25 April 2009,Genius,"This film attacks every ambition in art, in living, and our basic human ideals. In art, someone tries to take something from life, from their knowledge, from their experiences, something personal, and give it form. It's so temporary, and it only gives us so much. But to do all life. To recreate EVERYTHING. Not just a small part of our choosing, but every part. Every life. A movie about Life, and it's loops, and contradictions, and love and hate. Being absolutely alone, but at the turn, being someone else. And finding that being different is only an illusion, as is everything we understand. One of our own design, where everything around us is a reflection of ourselves, and we don't see it, even when it's looking directly in our faces. What this movie tackles, and succeeds in is staggering. Caden, whose work starts out impersonal, doing plays at the local theater, doing his own shallow takes on works not of his own design, is what drives away his wife. His wife, seen both as evil, and sympathetic, is Kadens muse. Someone who's ambitions and truth get smaller, and more generalized. As Caden, who's constantly spurred by her, goes in the opposite direction. He gets bigger, encompasses more, grows. And that eventually leads to our own human unavoidable contradictions. The play starts to loop in on itself. A true representation of reality, done over and over concurrently, is a true turn in what can be seen as surreal. Caden is unsure. In a search for truth, the ones who succeed find that nothing but failure is possible. Faced with such an epic task as recreating what's true, life, Caden gets lost in the one he's living. He wants to search for truth, but he searches within others, asking them to define him. Asking to be told what to do. Being faced with choices, and responsibilities to ones self can be a terrifying concept. And Caden can't handle that truth. He doesn't allow himself much control, not making decisions for himself, by himself. Constantly reflecting onto others, to get an idea of what he wants. The idea of actually being forced to see himself, and what he does to those around him, and what it means, throws Caden completely out of touch. Lost in between what's real, and what he's trying to recreate as real. Towards the end, he takes on the life of the woman he was pretending to be at one time, someone who he projected himself through, not considering the truth behind the identity of Ellen. He lives as she does, with her worries, with her story as his own. And he learns that the significance of something like life is nothing, but at the same time, the same for everyone. That life binds everybody as one, and we separate ourselves, by ourselves. Living without making choices, pure living, like if we never ate the apple. Feeling as we are, without the guilt of wheater or not we failed when freedom to choose became too much of a burden, and we make decisions we don't agree with out of confusion. His time as Ellen is the most important, it killed his ego, and allowed him to live as another, Ellen, not Caden. The other characters were perfectly complimentary. Helen, who made decisions whether she was unsure or not. Someone Caden could admire. Who suffered very similar insecurities, but still moves forward. Adele, his wife, was the perfect foil. Someone who cared more about being happy, and self interest, and was sure of herself. Her small paintings were symbolic of her assurance. Being able to address individual truths, and individual ideals. Sharper and sharper generalizations, one that never reached the inevitable paradox that Caden faces. Single subjects, painted tiny as they can be conceptually understood to be, but still holding true. It's the subject, an individual truth. And only that subject. Sammy, playing a reflection that wants to be something more. He is supposed to be Caden. He knows what Caden knows at first. And is indeed his reflection. Caden, seeing himself separate from himself, begins to change in a way that Sammy starts to be someone different. Sammy can do nothing but reflect, but when Caden begins to act in his own interest, and pursue things without being told to, Sammy snaps. And kills himself. Death can mean so many things. The end of the story that we're all writing, all the time. Our perceptions of it vary to an infinite degree. In here, it's seen simply as the end. Where it means no more than what we assign it. Walking through the streets of dead bodies, Caden, dead in every sense of the word but body. Ego killed, his sense of self completely gone, feels nothing. Death is no longer something to fear, but common place. Not even reflected in his eyes as negative. Just a simple fact of reality. Like the ground he walks on, and that he takes for granted as being there every step he takes. This film is absolute genius. One of the most ambitious films ever written. Ambitious films like 2001, Ikiru, and The Fountain. It tackles our ideas and perceptions themselves. And it follows through brilliantly."
208,"Synecdoche, New York",7,30 March 2009,Misery thrives on company.,"Heavy on the negativism, self loathing, depression and reality crossing the line into mental fantasy. Caden Cotard(Philip Seymour Hoffman) is theatrical director, who finds his life turning to s#@t; too be exact his s#@t is turning colors. His wife(Catherine Keener)leaves him and takes their daughter to Germany. He also struggles with romantic relationships that he feels obligated to. Adding to his troubles, he discovers he is suffering a mysterious degenerative medical condition. He wants to leave his 'mark' on the world before he dies. His death is a dual obsession. Cotard's next project is turning his life into a monumental theater production. He builds a full-scale model of New York City inside a humongous warehouse and fills it with thousands of actors. His new piece is deeply personal and foreboding. Cotard unwittingly is creating his own monster that will swallow him whole.This movie is sad, dark and indulgent. Hoffman is excellent. Others in this cast of thousands: Michelle Williams, Hope Davis, Tom Noonan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Samantha Morton, Emily Watson and Dianne Wiest."
209,"Synecdoche, New York",7,8 February 2009,I guess we see what we choose in this movie,"No point in rehashing the putative plot here - it has been summarized many times above. However, I see this all as a dream that Caden is having, that he is partly living until his wife tells him she is going to Berlin without him and that he is totally immersed in after she tells him this. So many of the scenes can be viewed only as dreamlike (the burning house - cleaning his ex-wife's apartment - ignoring the existence of his second daughter) and make such sense when you see him inventing endings (all unhappy of course) to where his life will go after Adele leaves. Did Death of a Salesman really get rave reviews for his unusual staging? Do you really think that this ""unusual staging"" of an old classic will earn him a MacArthur grant? Or that the approximately one million bucks will allow him to keep running his play in the making about his life and everyman's life for forty years? Or that all these gorgeous women are really throwing themselves at him? I see this as all part of his neurotic processing, in a dreamlike state, of Adele taking a month off? Will she come back or .... let's invent a glamorous life in the art world of Germany for her and make her a superstar artist while we are at it. Let's imagine all of the worst things that could happen to little Olive and play them out in our minds - death by tattoo. Let's pretend that I got a MacArthur grant - she'll be sorry now that all these glamorous women are throwing themselves at me. And look at me - love em and leave em. Let's make this play about the way everyone is a star in his or her own drama - and stage it on a huge, life like scale. And keep replaying scenes over and over in our minds. And don't forget that us neurotic souls always are standing outside ourselves, analyzing and observing ourselves - enter Sammy. Let's get really sick and almost die - that will make her feel guilty. Well, that didn't work - let's move on and just need a cane. And since this is a dream about me and I am fantasizing mostly about Hazel, the two of us can age but everyone else will stay young.OK - maybe you other reviewers didn't see it that way, but it seems we can all agree that it was a movie worth seeing, the acting was terrific, as was the cinematography but that the script should have been edited way down. Even one's own dreams get annoying when they go on way too long and one is obsessively repeating all the things one has already gone through. I am not sure editing the movie would do it - the whole script would have needed it before shooting. Perhaps then it wouldn't just be a elite (elitist?) few who thing they ""get it"" and other very thoughtful folks could find something to hang onto in the movie as well. Especially, let's hope that Mr. Kaufman can learn from what he did right and not so very well in his directorial debut and bring us something tighter with a fuller character next time out. He's not Fellini yet but neither was Fellini when he did his first movie..."
210,"Synecdoche, New York",6,18 January 2009,disappointing,"As an admirer of Kaufman's other work (""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Adaptation""), which I consider excellent and ""Eternal Sunshine"" a film masterpiece, I was greatly disappointed upon seeing ""Synecdoche, NY,"" to which I looked forward. At least at this point in his career, Kaufman needs a director to say ""No"" to, ""change,"" or ""add to"" certain scenes & help him guide the narrative so that it makes sense. I enjoy ambiguity and don't care about lack of clarity upon a first viewing as long as the general narrative makes sense or is understandable on a surface level. Thus, for example, I loved ""Adaptation"" even though I enjoyed only its surface on a first viewing (on a later viewing I recognized that the title also refers to the real not reel Charlie Kaufman's adaptation to Hollywood requirements) and I found Guy Ritchie's ""Revolver"" and ""RockNRolla"" immensely entertaining even though much of the story makes no sense to me on a third viewing of the former and a first viewing of the latter). Maybe a second or third viewing of ""Synecdoche"" will unearth its treasures, but after one viewing on the big screen, all I found was incoherence and perhaps self-indulgence. ""Noble effort but unsatisfying"" is, sadly, my general verdict, at least now; when I see it again on DVD I hope to change my mind."
211,"Synecdoche, New York",9,24 November 2008,Death Be Not Proud,"Synecdoche, New York is a ridiculous, absurd, and funny film. It is a disturbing, scary and depressing film. If you go into it with an open mind, it can be all of these things, sometimes at the same time. Caden Cotard (Phillip Seymour-Hoffman), is a theatre director living in Schenactady, NY. He's directing a regional production of Death of a Salesman with younger actors playing all of the roles. He is vaguely unhappy. His wife, Adele (Catherine Keener) is an artist. She is preparing for a show in Berlin. She ends up taking their 4-yr. old daughter and leaving Caden. He is depressed. He gets a MacArthur fellowship and uses it to rent a warehouse and start up an experimental theatre production involving actors that's going to represent real life by being ""brutal and honest."" He is also sick and going through a constant stream of medical examination that is more Kafka-esquire than sex with Woody Allen. He might be dying. Does that sound boring? Well, it's not. Bizarre things happen, fascinating ideas are explored, wonderful dialogue is spoken, and everything unfolds in a deliberate, steady pace. The less you know about the actual story, the better. This is an incomplete review, because I honestly can't think of way to explain or qualify the experience, except to say that I was completely engaged mentally and emotionally, and left the theatre with a big smile on my face, and my mind reeling."
212,"Synecdoche, New York",,24 November 2008,Post-Modern Experience,"I saw this yesterday and enjoyed it immensely. The huge cast of mostly familiar faces was a revelation as if being seen for the first time. That goes for Tom Noonan, Dianne Weist and especially Samantha Morton. I've seen her before but never has she been this warm and believable as a stock character in a ""movie"". The obsessive reiteration of Caden's vision, to my mind, succeeded in creating a living, breathing work of art. You should see it and judge for yourself. Some people definitely won't like it but watch the performers, keep your eyes and ears open for the little touches (super duper spoiler: the first thing Caden does in the movie is open the morning paper and read the headline: ""Harold Pinter Vindicated at 78"" and says: ""Harold Pinter is dead. No, he won the Nobel Prize."") From that point on enjoy the performances, the production design and the way the story wends its way to the conclusion."
213,"Synecdoche, New York",10,3 August 2009,Great FIlm,"I haven't seen it but I think it's great. As long as it has 3 explosions, it should be great. I always enjoy movies where people move inside the screen. I also like when they say things. I like it when directors name their films different names. This film is great because it's not a different film. Most films are other films. This film had a uniqueness of being different from other film, hence I think it is a terrific film. You should see this film. Most directors, writers, producers, and studios want you to see their films. This film was undoubtedly made to be seen. I don't want to spoil this movie for you because I can't. Most double negatives make sense. I digress. What made this film exceptional was it's willingness to be released to the public. This film was probably one of the rare pieces of work that could be called a masterpiece, but unfortunately, Peter Travers never saw this gem."
214,"Synecdoche, New York",1,28 February 2010,"Please Don't Do it, Please.","As a Fan of the Director Kaufmann and especially the Actor Seymour Hoffmann i was expecting a lot, but what was that? A movie you get depressions after having seen it. A guy, just being alone (while he is having sex with random people), having one bad day after another while the world around him is dying. Kaufmanns way of saying ""Lifes a bitch, then you die"", i guess. But what was lacking in the whole movie, was some kind of warmth, hope or Love!. Depressing from beginning to end. And here is why I really hated it: The worst thing about the movie was that Charlie Kaufmann tried to create some kind Fellini mystical moods , that feeling only a inspiring Artist and Director like Frederico Fellini could create, and thats where Kaufmann totally failed. The one thing Fellini always had in his movies was to give people hope or love even when it was a desperate or dramatic story. Thats what Kaufmann never considered , and it makes the movie empty with all its good acting and his 21 Million Dollars they spent on this film. So 2 hours of watching this makes you feel really empty and depressed."
215,"Synecdoche, New York",4,22 February 2014,The self-absorbed nature of the artist,"(Contains spoilers) A middle-aged theater director watches his life fall apart and documents it on stage, in a single play that remains in rehearsal for decades, i.e. metaphor for the artist working his life out through his work, but it never gets anywhere, he never finds any answers, everything is dissatisfying. As he ages the truth begins to slip through, and his fantasy of why his wife left him, and how much he misses his daughter is replaced by the reality that he had a homosexual affair, that the responsibility is his, and his daughter will never forgive him for abandoning her. Eventually he realizes he is a nobody, becomes tired, and dies. It starts of realistically, with fantasy segments clearly differentiated, then fantasy and reality become indistinguishable, the audience is initially left confused, but with enough confidence in the film to let it play out and deliver the pay off, and it remains engaging till the end. As a metaphor for the egotism and narcissism of a career artist, it would work just fine, but the final song playing out over the end credits rather suggests that this metaphor is supposed to apply to everyone, as if we were all so egotistically engrossed in our own selves, and an atheist to boot. Thankfully, not everyone lives in that kind of world."
216,"Synecdoche, New York",10,11 April 2013,An Emotionally Flesh Searing Performance of Epic Proportions by Watson,"This is a deeply affecting film and a strong cast is highlighted by the most courageous performance by Emily Watson since Breaking the Waves. Watson gives everything to the role of Tammy and it is an emotionally flesh searing performance never before equaled in cinema. To say she takes chances and risks her very essence is an understatement. She is unafraid to have a similar looking actress play opposite her and to do a scene that most women her age would not have the confidence to do. Of course those actors are not Emily Watson and do not share her quiet, natural beauty and her determination to look like a real person. Nor her bravery as an actor. Some may be shocked by the nudity but the point is that she is metaphorically baring her soul to us, opening her heart, and revealing her most profound feelings. The scene I speak of is beautifully done and exceptionally acted, spotlighting once again what a treasure this phenomenally talented actor, Emily Watson, truly is. She has taken a role that would ordinarily be defined as supporting and practically made it the centerpiece of the movie. One can not watch her in this piece and not be touched to the roots of their very being. There is a scene at a wake where she is simply listening to Hoffman talk as she sits next to him on a couch sipping from a bottle of soda. One must watch in wonder as she brings depth and meaning to it. There is something so magical about the way she works that it pulls the audience into the scene with an incredible magnetism. An astonishing performance that makes this motion picture a very special experience. The director does an excellent job with the rest of the cast and his imagination is stunning. Most of all, the way he utilizes Emily Watson shows that for a first time director he has the wisdom to recognize greatness in its purist form. He is working with gold here and allows a gemstone to catch its own light. By so doing, he has given the audience the opportunity of witnessing Emily Watson in one of her most powerful and beautifully realized roles. She is a treasure, a acting Goliath standing astride the Atlantic."
217,"Synecdoche, New York",3,21 June 2012,This film has everything i like about movies but still i don't liked it somehow.,"My favorite movie genre is drama, i love weird and surreal films, i love films about memory loss or illusion or whatever this should be. Mulholland Drive is probably my most favorite movie ever. I liked Memento ...But this somehow feels constantly lacking something, it's very hard to explain for me. I kind of knew what was going on all over the film, and somehow i struggled because i now knew. What does all if it mean? Does he really have affairs with his actresses? Why everybody likes him while he is a total wreck? Or is nothing of it ""real""? Well it's a mix-up of the play and the blurring reality, kind if what i like in Lynch films, but not here for some reason.The Story itself feels like it was just inverted to have as much weirdness as possible put in one movie. There is no evolving, no progress from minute 30 to 90. It's just repeating depressing surreal moments over and over again. We get it he's falling apart.Also i think there is is to unrealistic, who the hell pays someone to build such a play, and who practices there for years with a director who is out of his mind? Somehow i was disappointed with the ending, i have this often lately but somehow i hoped for a happy ending, that he gets his memory back, or at least that something more gets revealed and he comes a little bit to his senses. But that he was that old and that this was hie whole life feels just like ""oh this is not depressing enough lets make it even more depressing as much as we can"".I expected the end to be a more from the final play, unfiltered like it really happened, than just one short scene and i wanted to see at least something more revealed."
218,"Synecdoche, New York",5,19 March 2011,"Not bad, but not good either","I came into this movie expecting to see a play director set up a replica of New York and getting into this meta-reality of what's real and what's not. And the movie does give you that... like an hour into the movie. The first half is just Phillip Seymour Hoffman having weird old person problems like peeing brown urine and skin lesions, and also about him growing slowly more distant from his family. He tries to connect with Claire, a young actress, and Hazel, a box office girl in his theater troupe because he feels so isolated in his life. That's really the whole theme of the movie: being lonely and looking to connect with someone, anyone at all.Half the movie passes before he actually gets the idea to make a play about himself. He hires someone to play himself, the director of the play. Later he hires someone to play Claire, and someone to play Hazel, until everyone in real life has a counter-part playing the part of the original individuals. Then there are actors playing the part of THOSE actors, and still more actors pretending to be the secondary actors, and so on and so forth. The replica of New York is situated in a warehouse, and in that replica there's another, tiny warehouse with yet another replica of New York, and in THAT replica there's yet ANOTHER warehouse with another New York inside, and you get this effect reminiscent of turning 2 mirrors to face each other. When you get to the ending, you'll think to yourself, ""Wait, did that just happen? What... the... heck?""Unfortunately, it takes an hour just to get to the good stuff. It's true the movie wouldn't be complete without the whole depressing setup. You wouldn't understand his motivations for putting the play together if the 1st half didn't establish how lonely and sad he was. I just wish the setup could have been more concise."
219,"Synecdoche, New York",4,20 December 2009,wtf?,"Eccentric Screenwriter has never shied away from developing imaginative & surreal scripts such as ""Being John Malkovich"" & ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". So you would imagine that his directorial film debut would be a cinematic innovative masterpiece. I think not! ""Synecdoche, New York"" is a ridiculous, disoriented narrative that was truly ""cinecsucky"". Sorry Charlie! The film stars Phillip Seymour Hoffman as theatre director Caden Cotard, a repulsive soul who scares away just about every woman in his life. It first starts with his painter wife Adele Lack played by Catherine Keener. Adele surely lacks in empathy but surely not in bluntness. During a marriage counseling session with Caden, she informs their therapist that she would rather have Caden die. Adele does not dial the ""a die le"" button by murdering Caten, but she does leave him to Paris with their daughter Olive. That starts off a chain of Caden relationships with other women that never fall into romantic cadence which includes a box office assistant Hazel (Samantha Morton) and Claire (Michelle Williams) the aspiring actress in his theatre group. Caden's vision is to orchestrate an autobiographical theatre production in a grandiose warehouse by casting other actors to play him and then casting others to play who is portraying him. ""Say what?"" you thinking. My exact sentiments! The first half hour of ""Synecdoche, New York"" is an intriguing character study of a melancholy man going down a personal downward spiral, but when the whole autobiographical theatrical production comes into play, the film drowns itself to movie suicide with nonsensical themes. Kauffman's unpleasant direction and script were Charlie's devils! I am sure Sir Charles will rebound from this; he is too talented. Hey, I am a big fan of Phillip Seymour Hoffman but just about during the 45 minute mark of the movie, I wanted to see less of Seymour. Phillip's monotonous performance made me want to reach for some Phillip's MOM (Milk of Magnesia). I know that last line was silly, just wanted to channel the absurdity of the film into my film review. The supporting cast of the film seemed lost in oblivion, just like the characters they were portraying. Please do not be a part of ""Synecdoche, New York, New York"". This ""big apple"" theatrical-based movie is as rotten as they come! ** Needs Improvement"
220,"Synecdoche, New York",10,9 October 2009,psychologically depleted.,"The first time I watched Synecdoche, New York was a couple months ago with my boyfriend. It was the first Charlie Kaufman film I'd ever seen (and a gateway to his other movies ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Being John Malchovich""); it was definitely the most intense cinematic experience I've had yet. The first time around, it was really hard to follow and I wasn't used to trying to make sense of things that did not. Most of the movies I had been exposed to followed a strict storyline, where all questions were answered and everything made sense. Afterward, I sat frozen with my mouth open and didn't even realize I had been crying. I was overridden with sadness... the kind that keeps you awake and thinking about an empty life and lonely death. The second time I watched it, I wasn't bothered with trying to nail down details or keeping track with the dates. It was like having a memory or dream- some things don't exactly make sense but it doesn't matter because all you need to know is that they exist as a piece of a larger symbol.Synecdoche, New York is gloomy, disappointing, emotionally ravaging, and absolutely beautiful. It is best watched uninterrupted, and if you don't like or understand it at first, give it another shot."
221,"Synecdoche, New York",9,24 May 2009,Almost genius,"Synecdoche, New York is amazing. This is everything a modern film needs to be. Good acting, great cast, and intelligent. It's a film that asks serious questions about the human condition - about the self, the ego, about life, love, and death. What is the importance and role of one single human being is this whole vast mass of existence. It draws on the old philosophical metaphors between life and acting - we are all actors in God's great play, only some of us are trying to do the directing, when really we shouldn't be. It's a film that makes you think for a change. Yes, you will have to use your brain for this one, and for that reason I can understand why some don't and won't like it...If this film is not recognised as a masterpiece now I have a feeling it will be in years to come. The traditional story-line film has been done to death. This is the way forward. A constant stream of consciousness. It does what is one of the hardest things to achieve in film, mimics the real dream-like state. Gone is the continuity and logical process. If you can't get into the dream space this will go over your head, but this is a film that had to be made. The radical has to happen before change can start to take place. Does it sound like I'm being a bit over the top? Please give this film a go...My only fault is that at an epic two hours in length it is a bit overly long and does drag on in places to try to get some ideas across, but with this film it really doesn't matter. Hugely important. Thanks"

223,"Synecdoche, New York",5,30 March 2009,"nicely acted ,seemingly well made BUT a big mess.","Charlie Kaufman a writer of a few weird films both wrote & directed this confusing, uninteresting boring snooze fest.You all will have to read the trivia section to learn what the title means & how to pronounce it.Philip Seymour Hoffman a very fine actor is the star, he is too capable an actor to be in this. Catherin Keener & Diane Weist, who are both very capable are here as well.Let me finish this report with the following.Mr.Kaufman is one of those writers who have a gift for over-writing likePaddy Chayefsky who was also an award wining writer. I did not like most of his work either.By the way I was so bored I shut if off with 20 minutes still to go.Ratings: ** out of 4--60 points out of 100--IMDB 5 out if 10."
224,"Synecdoche, New York",6,26 March 2009,"Synecdoche, New York","Just like all of Kaufman's previous film it had a strong underlying plot that was actually deceptively simple. It had all the things that have made Kaufman's previous films so brilliant, but unfortunately this time it fell apart. Maybe it was because Kaufman himself was the director this time, and was simply not up to the task, or because Synecdoche, New York simply has too much of what made his previous films so great. It has two much whimsy and metaphors and too simple of a basis. Synecdoche, New York is the worst kind of mess. One that just misses brilliance. One that actually has a lot of brilliant in it, but squanders it."
225,"Synecdoche, New York",10,25 March 2009,Amazing,"I must say that this movie really took my breath away. I can usually appreciate a good film, but I have never been so emotional after seeing any movie than I was after seeing this one. I walked out into New York City utterly stunned. For a long time I did not want to watch another film, because I was afraid of getting this out of my head. I was also afraid, however, of seeing this film too many times, and it losing the ability to affect me. There is a lot in the film; it seeps with symbolism. Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut went highly under appreciated. If you like any other Charlie Kaufman films you are bound to enjoy this one. The usual surrealist elements are present, if not over emphasized here. If you like Charlie Kaufman's sense of humor you will enjoy this, but if you want him to explore more than just quirky comedies, you will also enjoy this. I hope that one day this film's appreciation will grow, because it was the best film I saw in 2008."
226,"Synecdoche, New York",7,21 March 2009,"Sometimes maddening, sometimes glorious, or maybe both?","Being John Malcovitch was super-smart, hip and very cynical. This is its maddening cousin: messy, clever and emotional. Eternal Sunshine definitely hinted at a more heart-driven creator, and indeed, this time Kaufman turns inwards.Part of me think he dropped the ball, and I'm quite convinced he feels the same way, there is a lot of reflections on such subjects in this film. Illussions of grandeur, self-pity, but also humor and love.Its a brave film. Not as clinically funny as his two first film. He wears his heart on the sleeve here, even if its a confusing mess (intentienally) of a film that surely will reward patient people greatly on further viewings. Remniscant of classics like 8½, but also of Beckets short-plays ( especially its darkly wonderful brand of humor).Its aptly directed, with a very nice score, by nature its a bit hit and miss, certain scenes are staggering in their confusing and heart-wrenching glory while other passes by unnoticed. Offcouse, different wievers will likely have different favorites.I don't expect a new Kaufman film anytime soon. But i think this is a keeper."
227,"Synecdoche, New York",10,13 March 2009,Maddeningly Impossible to Follow: A Terrific Surrealistic Adventure,"SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK is a firecracker display that sets the audience up for a grand epic of adventures then sputters its lovable way through over two hours of loosely connected views of life as we live it - through the eyes of an increasingly physically disabled director Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Trying to summarize what the story is and does is always as risky task when it comes to Charlie Kaufman films and the audience for this work will be decidedly separated between the love it or hate it division. Kaufman manages to address so many issues (marriage, adultery, joblessness, that thin thread of sanity that keeps actors committed to impossibly complex problematic productions, etc) that keeping up with the nonlinear story line is challenging at best. But with a cast of characters as finely portrayed by actors such as Samantha Morton, Catherine Keener, Hope Davis, Michelle Williams, Jennifer Jason Leigh et al, the whole crazy film works wonders on the imagination. This is pure entertainment for the sake of entertainment and while Caden Cotard does represent Everyman searching for some semblance of meaning in a universe that makes little sense (except that death is inevitable!), it is the process more than the dialogue that makes this film such a pleasure to follow. Charlie Kaufman has done it again....Grady Harp"
228,"Synecdoche, New York",10,13 March 2009,"A difficult, dark, pretentious and hopeless masterpiece","I've finally seen Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York, and jeezus. I thought his Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was trippy. How this film didn't sweep the Oscars I don't understand. Wait, yes I do. It's relentlessly bleakin that Woody Allen 'obsessed-with-death' waybut it's also belly crunch hilarious. I had to stop and rewind a dozen times because I missed things, overcome by a wheezing laughter. There is not a feel good moment in the film and yet it left me strangely uplifted.Charlie Kaufman is a contortionist of the mind. Again, like in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, he stretches and reshapes time (and space, to a degree) until you just have to let go, and yet, a firm narrative structure is always present, never abandoned. It's an amazing feat of screenplay-ism.The film is remarkably cast. Philip Seymour Hoffman is, well, he's one of the best actors working today and he is perfect for the role of representing, on film, the introverted, insecure because he's seen the abyss genius of Charlie Kaufman. His performance is better, ten times better, and funnier, than anything he's done before. Imagine that! Catherine Keener? Has any one ever had a bad word to say about her? The pièce de résistance, however, in a creepyas if it were meant to be but will never happen again but seems like it may have, or should have, been done beforekind of way is Emily Watson playing Samantha Morton. You'll have to see it to understand. If a fifth wall existed, this film would shatter it.Casual movie-goers will find Synecdoche, New York difficult, dark, pretentious and hopeless, but if you like film, if you like writing, if you like artistic commitment, if you like mind-bending hilarity, don't miss it."
229,"Synecdoche, New York",8,10 March 2009,Kaufman in Flesh,"First of all, it would be wrong to term this a 'movie' and treat it as one. It in fact feels more like a painfully honest and revealing conversation with Charlie Kaufman, a conversation that's peppered with debates, disappointments, some interesting revelations and some very mundane ones.It's great to see the amount of freedom Kaufman has for expressing himself, and he really does, just letting out years of frustration and simply enjoying the pleasure of being able to say whatever the hell he wants to, the way he wants to. Kaufman is gloriously self-indulgent and doesn't bother one bit about the viewing audience. He's not bothered if the audience would want to just walk out at any stage, just like they would on a dialogue that they have decided has ceased to engage them anymore. Kaufman's creation is one of those truly rare experiences which if one even chooses to ignore won't matter a jot, as a person will definitely encounter most of the script during the course of one's life anyway, and if one chooses to watch it, well then the experience is just that - life, in all it's strange and surreal uncertainties and complexities, along with our complete and conscious detachment from the fact that we are extraordinarily insignificant in the entire realm of the universe."
230,"Synecdoche, New York",7,10 March 2009,quite a grand film,"Brief description: a character development/analysis film where individual sections are more contextual to the whole. But what is that whole? The movie clobbers this question with the main character and probably entices the viewer to tackle the question for themselves. First time through, the movie seems a bit disjoint, but still pleasant due to the strong acting and I became taken with the development of the characters, their emotions, detachments, and derived meanings- or at least their attempts at meaning. All the while the viewer is all- knowing in the main character's continuing journey, and eventually the journey drags the viewer (hopefully) in along for the ride.Subsequent viewings add nuances in the acting adding to the performance, eventually hoping the viewer tweaks out more meaning or at least enjoyed the ride- (as always, i think viewers need to be in the mood for such a film... i usually am)."
231,"Synecdoche, New York",10,8 March 2009,Simply Genius!,"Sure, this film might remind you of Fellini's Eight and a Half, or maybe you'll find yourself thinking of Bergman's Wild Strawberries. I am sure they were a source of inspiration for Kaufman. But in spite of all this, Synecdoche, New York is the most original American film I've seen in years. I am not going to summarize the content of this movie for that would be idiotic. Suffice to say that this film, as other users have said, is a truly affecting film --actually, is more than a film; it is an experience... and a very affecting one. A work of genius that I will be watching over and over for years to come."
232,"Synecdoche, New York",9,6 March 2009,This film...,"I watch many films. In fact, I even can obsess over ratings, awards, acting capabilities, etc... The minute I started watching SNY, I never thought about anything. This tapped into every part of my mind, and as soon as Dianne's voice-over ""Die..."" hit the screen, I finally noticed I was crying my eyes out. I don't know why, I don't think I ever will. It was the most unexplainable experience of my life. I don't think this will ever happen again, nor have I ever experienced anything like this before... I do not know exactly what to think post-watching SNY.How can a film like this be made? I do not know exactly how to feel about it, but the strange thing is I have no desire to. For some odd reason, I feel like I understand life, death, vision, art... all of that just by allowing myself to become submerged into SNY.I do not plan on watching this film ever again, only because I fear the feeling it gave me now will be lost. This is just... more. That is how I can explain it. I'm sorry if I sound confusing, but it really is impossible to comment on this film."
233,"Synecdoche, New York",,27 February 2009,"critics...they shoot horses, don't they...?","especially those of different colors... a few nights ago i was watching the academy awards...since Hoffman did a movie or two in '08, he was nominated. nothing unusual about that... then the actor on stage starts reciting his praises for Hoffman... it went something like this... 'to go where few actors have gone before...' well. if that applies to Hoffman, it's b/c people like kauffman wrote the book... i'm sorry for you folks who need something with a message. something cohesive. and can't appreciate a beautiful, if not grotesque, collage. then again, it's not easy viewing. not for everyone. it's amazing how many people feel that when they can't understand something, it must be pretentious. or just plain bad...brave for the studio to support such an effort. they KNEW they were going to lose money on THIS one... then again, there were enough people who enjoyed the experience, according to the comments. i hope those who had to do with the process of its making finds some comfort/justification in that..."
234,"Synecdoche, New York",10,4 January 2009,"For the cognoscenti only...that means you!  Yes, you, hiding in the back.","That was wonderful (tearing up)...I don't get it (bemused air). These responses bracketed me as I arose at the end of the credits. Synecdoche is a must see if you enjoy film and are open to a bit of thought at the cinema, but stay away if you expect a Hollywood movie entertainment. Synecdoche is a revelatory simulacrum of the universal human condition for the former, a worthless biopic of a fictional narcissist for the latter. I think it most excellent.Hazel gives us a hint of the philosophical underpinnings of Synecdoche when she mentions to Caden that she is reading The Trial, by Kafka. This theme is reinforced when we reflect on Caden's choice to stage Death of a Salesman and to cast it with young actors. Death must come to all, and even the young must examine this fatal condition of life. Death comes to Josef K. at the early age of 31 because he chooses to fight the imposition of judgment rather than to seek a protraction, an indefinite period of time when he could live out his life without being consumed by his Trial. Caden similarly dies at an early age, as his essence turns to stone for the remainder of his life after Adele leaves him. He is trapped forever in Apartment 31Y.Hazel, in the same scene, deprecates herself as an idiot, bringing to mind (to a predisposed mind, at least) Dostoevsky and, in turn, to his other book, Der Doppelganger. Caden creates a cast of doppelgangers in the play he develops, and, like Golyadkin's double, Caden's double becomes more likable, more of what a successful Caden should be than Caden himself.Caden could have taken to heart Camus' directive: ""But the point is to live."" Hazel and Caden would have been happier for it, but it doesn't happen just by reading the words, a satori must occur, by some undefinable process. It never did happen for Caden. So it goes.But it can happen. It happened for Daniel Miller in Albert Brook's comedy, Defending Your Life. If you despair after seeing Synecdoche, catch DYL on DVD. You'll have a laugh over the horrifying human condition and perhaps can then see Synecdoche again and laugh in the right places."
235,"Synecdoche, New York",5,21 December 2008,"Sincere, but...","I'm addicted to director Charlie Kaufman's work, which is original, amusing, and often deeply expressive. Unlike filmmakers who use devices as quick and easy effects, Kaufman always shows uncommon depth. Synecdoche, New York is the challenging story of a award-winning stage director (Philip Seymour Hoffman) overcome with feelings of his own mortality - and given a windfall to create a totally original work. Despite clear humor, Synecdoche, New York has an overall feeling of melancholy and even despair. Fatalism is almost the equal of honesty in this film, and its grimness is hard to shake off, even after you've left the theater. There's lots to think about, but a lot of it is what we've heard before, and more eloquently. And this is really too bad, because the film's desperate mood is bound to scare potential viewers away. The good news is that it's likely to win an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay."
236,"Synecdoche, New York",7,12 December 2008,a matter of life and ?,"As far as Charlie Kaufman scripts go, this one has the distinction of being both the most ambitious and, paradoxically, the slightest in terms of what he really has to say. All of his films (and he is one whose name on the screenplay makes the film as much his as the director's) ask big questions about life: the meaning of evolution (Human Nature), the essence and power of creativity (Adaptation), memory and romance (Eternal Sunshine), fame and identity (John Malkovich, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.) With Synecdoche, he grapples with all of these themes and, unlike these other great films, comes up short in both entertainment and edification.It's not so much nihilism or existentialism that drives Kaufman's narrative here, as much as incomprehension of what the world really means. In the face of attachment and loss, egomania, sexuality, aging, sickness, and death, the character of Caden is as helpless to believe in an afterlife as he is to form a coherent narrative for his own life. That is why the ending is so extremely unsatisfying. This film has been compared to some of Lynch's later works; nothing could be farther from the truth. David Lynch has a clear vision of the meaning and reality of the ""afterlife"" and has the courage to show that it is both terrifying and supremely important. Kaufman simply shows us that after all that confusion, self-pity, and fear that was Caden's life, death is a FADE TO WHITE. While that may make small-minded people comfortable, and that he died in the arms of a compassionate woman, it is a lie and a cop-out. The soul formerly known as Caden Cotard didn't appear to work a lot of karma out in that particular lifetime. And still has demons of his own creation to face in the bardos. The central character of Caden Cotard lives 90% above the neck, intellectualizing everything, communicating information and his own feelings poorly, to the point of scaring his daughter when he's trying to comfort her. And yet he is looked upon as a creative genius, for his ""bold"" twist on ""Death of a Salesman,"" and pursued by attractive young women for some strange reason. Because he is married he seems to have a moral code but it is weak and relative to the situation. When he begins his magnum opus, the parallel to Fellini's ""8 1/2"" becomes obvious, except that where Mastroianni's sex appeal is potent and his creative crisis sympathetic, Hoffman's is pathetic and would be laughable if Kaufman hadn't lost his sense of humor somewhere in the conception and realization of this film.Kaufman surrounds his alter ego with several of the most talented actresses working today and yet because their characters are living in some desperate reality pursuing their own dimly recognized needs, or in the even more desperate fantasy world generated by Kaufman/Cotard, they do not connect with any truth. Even so, Samantha Morton must be singled out for another brilliant performance, particularly for the way she conveys both youth and old age."
237,"Synecdoche, New York",10,23 November 2008,Humor may not be the best medicine,"I read the comments and just got back from seeing the movie a little while ago. This movie is really about what it means to be alive and a thinking and reasoning being.I admit to being a bit disturbed when people started laughing in the movies. Certain points seem to be comical in nature such as his father's funeral, but I think it was more of a metaphor of how death effects us. In my opinion the part's that seem comical actually have a lot more meaning then people really understood. The director may have been going for humor but I think everything in this movie is so incredibly well thought out that I don't believe in such a dreary setting the director would have just made something to get people to laugh.Even the disease that the main character experience is so interwoven, that is isn't so much as a physical thing as a symbol for our own death of being an individual. I think the director was trying to explain how our youth tells us how we are the center of the world but as we age, that view of us being independent and an island dies piece by piece. His body shutting down had more to do with his realization of just how connected he is to everything. It was as if he as an individual was dying.This movie is very very very philosophical. If you don't like that sort of thing then I would avoid this movie like the plague, and before laughing during the movie I would really recommend trying to understand why the director put that piece of the movie like it was. I think this movie was so thought out that everything has a meaning, the colors, the sounds, the characters. They all have multiple meanings.I probably will need to see this movie a few more times, but if you like post modernism or existentialism I would HIGHLY recommend this movie. I couldn't say it was a 'good' movie because it is a very amazing imitation of life. It just is, and you will probably want to cry by the end of the movie."
238,"Synecdoche, New York",2,6 November 2015,too much freedom or something,"After watching the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and hearing that Charlie Kaufman would finally direct a movie Synecdoche, New York was a must see. I think i don't have to elaborate on that.Then i saw the movie and it was disappointing, to say the least. As if someone took the worst parts of all previous Charlie Kaufman's movies and glued them together in one excruciating mess.Not sure why this happened. Was it Kaufman's ambition to top everything he'd done or producers' demand for a movie with artistic ambition? Either way, Synecdoche, New York is almost painful to watch.The crew offers a fine performance, but within a given framework this didn't help."
239,"Synecdoche, New York",3,1 September 2010,Bad,"this film is merely a rehash of the same masturbatory and shallow ideas that Kaufman always uses. It creaks with artifice and hamhanded plot machinations, and Kaufman is a one trick pony (high concept/low payoff) and the horse only has one leg. His film is obviously derivative of many other works, be they good: The Mirror (whose deep narrative structure is far more subtle and truly dream-like than this film's predictably Byzantine melodramas), Stardust Memories (whose ending pulls out the rug of the film with devastating effect vs. this film's tedious every other minute rug-pulling), 2001: A Space Odyssey, Last Year In Marienbad, Cube; or bad: Mulholland Drive, The Truman Show, The Thirteenth Floor. And the acceleration of the film's narrative, into a trite meta-mish-mash lacking style, but rife with dullness, has only one redeeming feature: it affords a keen observer the opportunity to see how mediocre films miss excellence. Like his fellow filmic perpetual preteen-minded brethren- Tim Burton and Quentin Tarantino- Charlie Kaufman is constitutionally incapable of not making the same film over and again, save for minor details. His puerile tripe is all heart and no brains, sort of like the Scarecrow, from The Wizard Of Oz.yet another better film this one leaches from. Will someone please say cut already?"
240,"Synecdoche, New York",4,28 July 2009,"Impressive experiment by Kaufman, but  one long death wake of depression of a movie.","Another unique Charlie Kaufman creation: NY theater director Hoffmann's life is withering as his health deteriorates, his wife leaves and moves abroad, taking their daughter along. Suddenly a grant allows him to slowly stage his own life as one enormous once-in-an-era play, using actors to play himself and his real-life surrounding fellow humans, in time-lapsing mode... or is that what's really happening? It's naturally no coincidence that Hoffmann's character is staging ""Death of a salesman"" at the beginning, since this IS Kaufman's own paraphrase of the same play, but with his completely unpredictable surreal touches that breaches and blurs the line between stage and screen. As an experiment itself, this is both fascinating and impressive with top acting. As a movie, unfortunately, it's one long, plodding death wake of depression. The dark laughs of the first half become scarcer and scarcer, leaving a most bleak, heavy and claustrophobic load for its audience to carry (and care less and less about) as its protagonist is lead into a fate that is hinted quite early on. It's sort of as if Woody Allen meets David Lynch and shakes hands with Robert Altman - on Valium... Might need and improve by repeated viewings, but for that to happen to me, will take a while! 4 out of 10 from Ozjeppe."
241,"Synecdoche, New York",8,21 December 2008,Nine and a Half,"One of the most exasperating films I have ever seen, SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK had me half wanting to leave the theater while the other half wanted to cheer for the sheer chutzpah of all concerned. Was it brilliant? Was it pretentious? Damned if I know. All I do know is that I stayed with it from beginning to end though many people walked out.In this film life reflects art, art reflects life and truth and illusion are blurred to a point of madness. Though there is no real relation between them, as I watched Kaufman's film, I kept thinking of Fellini's 8 1/2, so since the musical version of that film was called NINE,for me at least, this ends up being NINE 1/2. If you see it, I think you'll see what I mean.Hoffman is good as always, Michelle Williams was marvelous and Catherine Keener was, as always, superb.Don't go expecting an easy ride as you will be frustrated. However, should you go with friends who are film buffs and are ready to spend an hour or two over coffee or a drink battling about a film's merits or lack of same, this film is for you."
242,"Synecdoche, New York",2,5 December 2011,"Um, what?","Commonly referred to as 2008?s most ?challenging? movie largely because critics have a hard time getting ?WTF? published in most media outlets. It largely doesn?t work as an entertainment given its turgid pacing over an unnecessary prolonged 124 minute running time but it is useful in judging the ?BS? factor of people who have seen the film. If you speak with or read someone who claims to have understood the film?s deeper meaning in tropes such as the rapid passage of time and the recurring doppelgangers you can be sure you are dealing with some degree of con artist. Even the normally brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman grows tiresome aping an overweight version of every Woody Allen nebbish, neurotic hypochondriac who somehow still beds attractive younger women. The remainder of the excellent cast (Dianne Wiest, Jennifer Jason Leigh, etc.), like the audience, appears to slog through dialog and situations to dull to make decode this mess worth the effort. For a far better surrealistic look into the mind of writer rent 1991?s Barton Fink from the Coen brothers (?I want to give viewers a Barton Fink moment, I assume you are familiar with these given you are Barton Fink?)."
243,"Synecdoche, New York",4,22 March 2010,Terrible...Avoid!!,"I watched this movie with positive expectations- what a huge disappointment. About one hour was enough- I turned it off (which is rare for me- I nearly always stick it out to the end!) Philip Seymour Hoffman is making a habit of playing these ""loser"" characters, as in The Savages from 2007 (also way over-rated). Actually, I turned that one off, too. The character is preoccupied with his poor health, when he has no one but himself to blame. This is what happens when you get overweight and get no exercise! Deal with! There's nothing memorable about either the characters or the film-making. More Hollywood hype- the machine at work."
244,"Synecdoche, New York",9,22 December 2008,all the world's a stage,"All the world's a stage/ And all the men and women merely playersShakespeare's lines take a different turn in the latest film written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by him in an astounding debut. This is not a perfect film, and Kaufman stories may be loved or hated, but they certainly do not leave viewers indifferent and this is the case here as well. Caden Cotard, the hero of the movie acted by Philip Seymour Hoffman (is he the best actor today? Can more than one Oscar for lead role be awarded to the same person the same year?) is a stage director. He is also a very typical failed middle class American intellectual, he has a family but he cannot keep it, he is involved with several women but he cannot make love to them, he is more neurotic than Woody Allen and he as hypochondriac as you can get, to the extent that he ends by being really sick and crippled of all the maladies that he can imagine. He is however a man of talent, and he wins a big prize that would allow him to put on stage the project of his life. And the project of his life becomes a the stage rendition of his life, in a huge space that recreates the big city, with actors that will play himself and everybody he gets in contact with. Just only that theater characters not only take lives of their own, but they start to interact with reality and the two plans meld and interact in a labyrinth in which stage directors start to direct life, and love is possible between the real and virtual peers, in which stage alter egos die sometime before the real life personas, or they survive their incarnations in reality and continue their existence over death. Some of the final scenes seem to allude that the theater show may continue beyond the real existence. Art transcending life? A possible interpretation of a film and story with too many possible meanings to catch into only one single explanation. As I said this is not a perfect film. I did have the feeling that by the end the characters kind of lost control and repeated themselves without surprises of new messages. Kaufman the scriptwriter plays within a whirlpool of time, and screen months and years sometimes seem to flow in a turbulent manner and certainly do not last equal time. The story starts in 2005 and lasts for about 40 years in the future, well, five to ten years could have been spared. Yet this is such a rich and complex story, with such a fascinating acting (beyond Hoffman watch the superb pair of Samantha Morton and Emily Watson) and obsessing relations building between life and imagination that eventually after viewers leave the cinema theater the show continues in their minds."
245,"Synecdoche, New York",10,11 November 2008,Ceci N'est Pas Une Vie,"Mind-boggling. Socrates said that the unexamined life is not worth living, but what if a life is so given over to self-examination (and self-description) that the process of examination itself is what ends up being chiefly examined? This film, not ""Adaptation"", is the one in which Charlie Kaufman should have named his protagonist ""Charlie Kaufman."" It's a surrealist film about the surrealism inherent in trying to produce ""realism"" in Art.Caden wonders at the idea that his vast theater space might have been used to stage ""King Lear"", and that's an apt question (as well as a production of ""Lear"" I'd pay any amount to see), but he might just as well have wondered about staging ""Hamlet"" there. ""Synecdoche, New York"" is Kaufman's ""Hamlet."" Or perhaps it might best be considered ""Bottom's Play"", because it hath no bottom."
246,"Synecdoche, New York",1,11 October 2015,So how do movies like this get made.,"So let me get this straight, budget $21 million. How does a movie like this ever recoup that sort of money. Obviously I thought it was drivel, but then that was obvious from the one star. They should give the option of no stars surely. If your a liberal Arty type who studies a scribble on a canvas and ""gets it""; oh and takes copious drugs, then you might get something out of it. A normal sane human being; forget it. I lasted about two thirds of the movie, which I'll never get back. This Hoffman guy is no longer with us I believe. I wonder why. It started off normally; a small family, he's a theater director, she a miniature painter, and a small daughter. No great hook there but one continues to watch. Then it hastily become surreal nonsense. There, written enough, you get the idea. Summery, liberal arty type on drugs; you'll no doubt ""get it"". For NORMAL people, I'm trying to save couple hours of your life"
247,"Synecdoche, New York",1,23 February 2015,Sickening Beyond Belief,"Minus 10 out of 10. This is not a movie. It's a hallucination. I was so eager to see this movie that I drove three hours to a special viewing in NYC in 2008. I'm a huge Hoffman fan (at least I was before he overdosed) and count 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' and 'The Savages' as two of my favorites. I also dig crazy mixed up flix like 'Memento.' But this movie Wow. This movie was ultimately so disgusting, vile, pointless and worthless.The first hour is good. We have established characters and a layout for what you anticipate will be a tough but ultimately fulfilling slog. But it turns really bad really fast and when it does, it will likely turn your stomach. So painful to watch. Lacking even a trace of a redemptive quality on any imaginable level. Such a huge disappointment.One critic described the experience as two hours of a five year old smearing dog feces in your face. I would say it was only one hour of this treatment but you get the point.Under no circumstances or state of mind should you watch this movie. You've been warned."
248,"Synecdoche, New York",9,25 May 2017,Box office numbers won't show its class,When a friend of mine suggested this movie to me i was kinda confused about it but when i watched the movie I just thanked my friend the next day. This movie is one of the best example of a postmodern movie. If u r also looking for suggestions the mate just go for it its a worth watching movie. Just go and watch asap!
249,"Synecdoche, New York",10,18 May 2017,A Contemporary Masterpiece,"This film is a masterpiece.Until now I have seen a lot of films from the 21 century all the good blockbusters,all the critical acclaimed,all the Oscar winners and the Palm d'or winners and this is the one and I want to believe that like many other films this one will gain its deserved respect."
250,"Synecdoche, New York",1,21 April 2017,"The Genius of Synecdoche, New York (Part 5)","Hey Guys, Adam Here. I'm sorry I didn't have enough time to put this on tape, but here's the final part of my 'Synecdoche, New York Analysis;' Philip Seymour Hoffman did a good job acting, the makeup effects were pretty good too. In Conclusion, It was a Good Movie and there are lots of references to other things in it."
251,"Synecdoche, New York",10,17 October 2015,This is a movie about you,"Synecdoche is the kind of movie that will absolutely divide audiences. Some will think its a masterpiece, some will think is a pretentious mess. For the better or the worse (depending on whose reading this) Im on the first group. This is by far the best film Kauffman ever wrote and it's only fitting that he directed it. A movie that will haunt you on every decision that you make and you'll realize that you're not as different from the rest as you may think. Whats the movie about? Its hard to describe. You could say its about a man who, over the years, is trying to make his ultimate masterpiece in theatre. But that just an understatement of what happens after the initial problem is presented. This movie is ultimately about life, about decisions, about the way we see the world. Is it depressing? Kind off, but that's no the intention.This movie shows you that every human is a lot more complex that what you think, everyone's got their own story. If you think you cant relate to the characters here, just ask yourself a couple of questions: When was the last time you made a mistake that didn't have an effect until years later? Have you ever been so focused on what you were doing that you didn't notice everything bad around you? Do you sometimes think something happened a couple of months ago when it actually happened years ago? There's no need to touch on cinematography, score, sound or production design, they work. This movie is about its characters, every single one is worth studying. The cast does a fantastic job on making them feel normal. Even with their obvious flaws they make you realize that they are like someone you know. But the movie wont give you easy answers on anything. You'll have to see this multiple times to truly comprehend everything that there is to understand about them."
252,"Synecdoche, New York",3,26 April 2015,Kaufman sinks his boat,"Synecdoche, New York is written by Charlie Kaufman and is also his directorial debut. Its a topsy turvy mess of a film that will leave you baffled and by the end bored.Despite some good performances and set design its unfathomable. The film starts off straightforward enough as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Christine Keener are husband and wife living in an apartment with a young daughter. Hoffman has issues with his health, so does his daughter and it seems the marriage may not be happy as it seems. If you are keen eyed you will notice the newspaper date jumps about in time. A clue that not everything is all it seems, not unusual in a film written by Kaufman.As the film progresses and Keener leaves Hoffman the film gets more confusing and surreal. Hoffman spurns the romantic attention of Samantha Morton and it seems is oblivious to the sexual attraction of his therapist which later in the film is revealed as his latent homosexuality.This is before we get to his staging of his play which drags on for years and become more self indulgent and surreal.I do not mind a trippy film if there was some reward. The film instead just fights its audience. Kaufman the writer needed someone else to direct and rein it in a little and bring some focus."
253,"Synecdoche, New York",5,9 April 2015,"At Last, A Neutral Review of Synecdoche, New York","I think Charlie Kaufman was sincere in his intent and there are valuable nuggets in the movie, but he overloaded the cart. Things that worked well included the contrast between Adele the extreme miniaturist and Caden the omnipotent world-creator. The twists of fate such as Caden beginning the movie on the fast track to an early death but surviving for decades as he built his mystery house.The acting, however, bothered me a lot. Big cast of Hollywood's most actory actors acting at their most actory. It felt at times like a thespian Live Aid concert. Also, for the first time, I noticed Hoffman dealing out one practiced schtick after another. Too many incidents of Stan Laurelesque blubbering I've seen in other Hoffman performances. I know that Hoffman is no longer with us, and regret that, but truly great actors oscillate between outstanding performances and swan dives. No real reputational harm done in this case.In the end, Kaufman ran up against the limits of movies to convey complex artistic and philosophical concepts. Bergman packed a lot of layers and nuances in his movies, but kept things economical when it came to themes. Bergman also worked in an era when it was possible to comfortably make one movie per year over decades, with budgets that enabled financial backers to risk small bets to reap modest rewards. Kaufman did not have the luxury of this kind of penury, and had to place the biggest possible bet on the steepest odds on the green baize. The end result is too much for two hours. Would this have worked better as a high-end cable mini-series?"
254,"Synecdoche, New York",2,8 March 2015,Before this I was a fan of Charlie Kaufman...,"Charlie Kaufman, the genius behind Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, turns his hand to directing his own screenplay, and the result is the longest two hours of your life. It started OK, seeming like a decent emotional drama, but soon unravelled into boring pretentious crap.Charlie Kaufman scripts take a lot of concentration and thinking, and I did my best, but the look-at-me cleverness-for-the-sake-of- cleverness came in so many layers I eventually simply gave up trying to figure it out. Stuck it out to the end, but nothing became clearer.Every now and again there is a sniff of a theme and some coherent plot, and the play-wthin-a-play-within-a-movie-concept was a very original idea, but these are just red herrings and teases. In the end, nothing makes sense.The actors do an admirable job though, and need to be applauded for making sense of the script and direction.Avoid. This will just leave you with a headache, depressed and bored, and with two hours of your life wasted. However, it will change your view of Charlie Kaufman if you are currently a fan of his, as I was."
255,"Synecdoche, New York",1,16 January 2015,...,"All I can simply say, is that I hate this film. I like some artsy films, I love Jacob's Ladder and 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I've never been a fan of Kaufman's work.My biggest issue with the film is that it's a bunch of disgusting fluff made up of obvious and heavy-handed metaphors wrapped in a plot that almost seems to become convoluted just because ""that's how art works, right?"" Kaufman feels like a writer who should be making short films, rather than stretching a concept to it's limit so that it can be released in theatres as something horribly tired and boring.It's main theme seems to be ""don't waste time in life, or worry too much about dying or else you'll never truly live"". However, this is not a new concept and it is delivered particularly poorly here through characters that are both unlikable and unrelatable. The fact that this is so highly rated makes me more depressed than watching the movie did, and that's saying something."
256,"Synecdoche, New York",6,29 March 2014,"Very Surrealistic, but not so entertaining","You would expect a Surrealistic approach from Charlie Kaufman, similar in this case to that of adaptation, but I was too overwhelm.The late great Phillip Seymour Huffman plays a play write who puts on a stage play about his messy life and the production of the play is effected greatly by the production of his life. I think, I think I get the comparison. I thought it was interesting that Huffman's character Caden Cotard chose to make the play as real to his life as possible instead of attempting to make it better than his life. A similar choice made by the main character in Adaption who wanted to adapted the book The Orchid Thief into a movie without falling into the clichés of writing a movie in order to be true to the book. Caden's attempt to adapt a fateful telling of his own life lead to delays in trying to find the right actress to play the women in his life and it seem like he had to change the course of the play every time something new in his life occurs.The Surrealistic stuff was enjoyable but overall the movie was not very entertaining foe me. Maybe next time Charlie should get Spike Jonze to direct and he should stick to writing."
257,"Synecdoche, New York",,28 December 2011,Selfish synecdoches,"Thought doesn't merely reveal but is the thinker and so is every image. This is several things at once. A life-affirming tragedy about the modern nothingness of being. A poem on dying. A wordsmith's wordplay. An essay on presentation. It's palatable as each one but a mess when meshed together.We are involved in coming to understand how the author has selectively framed himself inside the film he enacts as life, many times over, and how life is continuously funneled into fiction wrapping memories. It's meant to be a personal project with big Proustian ambition. The problem is that Kaufman cannot extricate himself from the material. It is a selfish project, in the sense that it is about this man - Kaufman - perceiving himself within a life's work. So the essay is specifically about his removal from the real world that he puzzles to reproduce into fiction. The wordplay is about self-conscious cleverness. The poem is about self-pity. The tragedy is his tragedy.Every image is a thought is the thinker, much more clearly in our case by staging every thought as internal image that he directs. The whole thing begins to work by itself at some point, with him merely tagging along the contours of his own mind under the guidance of an internal narrator.The usual views about art in mind, people will tell you this is an important work of art because it's from and about personal experience and the only value art can have is as as the means of expression. Boring.I want art that is pottery for the soul, sculpted practice, embodiment without personal wallowing that justifies the work. I want open, this is closed."
258,"Synecdoche, New York",6,23 February 2011,Hmmm,"I give this movie a 6/10 on the basis that it is by no means badly made, but is not one I wish to sit through again for any reason; a strange experience, which in itself could perhaps be the best review I can give.Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Caden Cotard, a theatre director whose life is in disarray. With a marriage that appears to be in breakdown, bad dentistry, possibly fatal illness, and an unhealthy fascination with death, he begins to pump all his passion into theatre, deciding to write a play that will be brutal, real, and honest. It is not long at all before he is sucked into the recreation of his own life, which is being assembled in a huge, abandoned warehouse.The film is sprawling with ideas, and confirms Charlie Kaufman, who directs for his first time as well as writes, to be a truly strange mind. If you are familiar with his previous work, you know pretty much what to expect, although even to that I would say you might be surprised by just how odd this is; if you thought ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" was tough, as they say, you ain't seen nothing yet! The offbeat humour in a lot of the dialogue is typical of Kaufman's writing, and the performances cannot be faulted, least of all Hoffman, who does not appear to be able to do wrong. Keener, Williams, Jason Leigh, the list goes on, but everybody in this movie gives a real, thoughtful performance, although one does have to wonder if any of them truly knew where they were going at times.The film's main focus does appear to be on the fact we are all heading for death; it is the one and only certainty. Cotard's obsession with creating and being audience to his own life, having full control as director, is taken to extremes. The movie is full of visual metaphor, and the whole thing is the product of a creator who genuinely does not care if you are keeping up; he asks you to follow his logic and if you can't, it is not his problem. This is both what I admire and what I found annoying about the movie: technically we can see Kaufman's brain fires on all cylinders constantly, and we understand we must try to keep up with the logic. The problem, I found, was that the logic of it all was so twisted, the story curling in on and around itself over and over, actors playing different parts in scenes that repeat to reflect Cotard's own experiences, and the eternal struggle to write anything, which literally never ends, to illustrate his futile attempt to find some self-worth.I have no problem with challenge in cinema, but there must be some sort of catharsis in it all, and I had the issue of not being able to fully grasp onto anything in the film. Yes, scenes are emotional and well played in themselves, but when all sewn together, the humour aside, I found myself lost, and not in an altogether good way. Add to this the film's insistence on being so brutal about our existence, about the loneliness we experience, the inevitability of death, the fact ""everybody is disappointing, the longer you know them"", and that the entire final section of the film brings the weight of these negative ruminations down so heavily, you feel suffocated by the truth of it all, and you have a rather bleak and, I think, convoluted film.I do not deny the sharpness of the writing, nor the brilliance of the performances, and I even admire the fact Kaufman is being ambitious, trying to be completely honest about how he views human existence, not to mention experimenting with the form of cinema, ala Kubrick or Lynch. I do, however, find it tough to say it is completely successful; it is not a film I could properly connect with, or that I would recommend it to anybody.It may be brilliant in some respects, and if offbeat, existentialist drama is your thing it's not a bad film at all, but it is bleak without apology, overlong, and rather bemusing."
259,"Synecdoche, New York",4,12 January 2011,Charlie Kauffman's meta-fictions hit their breaking point,"Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut is an sprawling look at the paradox of translating introversion into expression, and this is by no means an original notion - just look at 8 1/2, Adaptation (written by Kaufman), Barton Fink, Inland Empire etc. etc. (hell, it might as well be its own genre...) Naturally, the product being a jumbled mess just comes with the territory, but I feel that 'Synecdoche' especially lacks the cohesiveness to convey anything more than abstraction - and least of all does it try for profundity. Unfortunately, Kaufman's writing is completely to blame because everything else here is pitch perfect - the casting/acting, the set, the sound editing all complement the ideas and mood throughout the film. What Kaufman needs to learn is that not all ideas are good, and to stick so many of them all so heedlessly into a movie and try to legitimize doing so with the title 'Synecdoche' is an insult to the viewers. I'll just stick with 8 1/2, thank you."
260,"Synecdoche, New York",7,12 December 2010,"Lives up to its ambitious nature, refusing to follow standard boundaries of time, scale and logic","""Synecdoche, New York"" is what could be a classic story of a man, Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman), suffering a mid-life crisis, unable to connect to his wife and daughter, but Charlie Kaufman takes that to extremes and turns it into an almost incomprehensible masterpiece.After his wife, Adele (Catherine Keener), leaves him, Caden starts fixating on his failing body and that death is just around the corner. His play becomes bigger in scope, impossibly so, and his need to get to the truth of himself becomes even harder to reach. One of the brilliant juxtapositions that Kaufman includes is how Caden sees the big picture and Adele sees the small picture. I believe one of the themes (probably one of many) in this film, is the juxtapositions of life. The grandiosity of Caden's play and himself in the play while Caden himself is feeling increasingly lonely and small. And also the insertions of humour in the face of the tragedy of life and death.The film accurately reflects the ambitious scope that Caden's play exhibits in impossible ways, and yet by the end, still tells a simple story of a man suffering a mid-life crisis - except it was told without any boundaries of time, scale or logic. It was supremely executed by the entire cast, especially Hoffman, and I believe it lives up to the MacArthur genius grant that Caden received in the film. ""Synecdoche, New York"" is the type of film that only the crazy genius Charlie Kaufman would attempt to make."
261,"Synecdoche, New York",10,5 June 2010,the mind as a constant obstacle to life,"Synecdoche, NY is a philosophical movie about our existence. Mr. Kaufmann shows us the common denominator of being human through the life of his main protagonist Caden.We all want to live life as happy as we can. But as soon as we start to think we start to produce fears, doubts and insecurities that interfere with our needs. Some of our most important needs are the need to love and to be loved. Happiness - if ever achieved- lasts only for a very short time. Sooner or later you burn out (the burning house). There's also the need to connect with our children and the need to leave something behind after death. Caden fails in all his attempts to fulfill these needs.The most agonizing need seems to be to overcome loneliness. In his lifelong play Caden tries to communicate his life to others. By replaying the most important moments of his life (by other actors) he manages to get outside of himself and to watch his own life trying to understand it and at the same time trying to connect to the outside world (his audience) to overcome his loneliness. After a lifelong analysis through the play he realizes death is the only constant company through life .Besides these capital themes Mr. Kaufmann is also commenting society: our vanity, our preoccupation with diseases in the losing battle to beat mortality and our inability to connect to each other. It's a sad and a funny movie but it's a true movie, like looking in the mirror. What do you want more."
262,"Synecdoche, New York",10,12 May 2010,The Quantum Mechanics of Storytelling,"A film like this could not exist 10, 20, 30, let alone five years ago. It's the concrescence of human intelligence, drama, emotion, and one that I'm eager to see outdone, for my own selfish reasons. Yet I can't imagine it being outdone soon. In this way, I agree with anyone who regards the film as a masterpiece, and think it should be carefully studied by anyone interested in film and/or writing. One would be perfectly justified to use this for critical and scholarly ends (i.e., getting one's PhD in some such relevant field). People to whom I've shown this film want a rational explanation. It's natural to want the linearity, balance, tidy endings and beginnings to which we're conditioned. But thankfully Kaufman is unable to bestow these tired mechanisms, because (I think he recognizes that) stories are unnatural to begin with. Thus, in Synecdoche, New York we're constantly bumping up against conventions of storytelling and film that behave as concrete features in the storyline itself, which goes against all ""rules"" of the game. Literally confusing the audience within the action of the story. Kaufman, like Lynch in Inland Empire, seems to recognize that on film, anything goes, should be able to ""go,"" simply because it IS film.And I like a film that uses its sleights of hand as tangible props. The fake tears is one tiny example. Kaufman is indeed a ""Lens Crafter,"" risking giving his audience pink eye of insight. In my humble opinion, he's the finest writer in Hollywood, if not the world of cinema right now. Is he offering diseased insights? If only dis-eased, then indeed! But back to my friends who want a tidy rational explanation: Ask yourselves if Caden is already dead before we meet him. It may be. If that helps it make sense, sure... think that. After all, many conjecture and some have even died for the cause, namely, does consciousness sputter on for a bit after we die? The fusion of identities is very dreamlike, not to mention the confusion of life/death states, plot lines informed by counter-plot lines, the agony of transience, the affirmation this lends to lovers of life, copulation and sermon peppered by the common interjection, pipes in the house, in your mouth, being right morally and being right.... I'm sorry, friends. There's no way to make the interplay of language and reality and their invisible halves and audience and theater and film and moviegoers and the billions of unacknowledged thoughts of everyone into a tidy movie: unless the movie depicts the lengthy culmination of insight as one flushes away from one's body and into darkness forevermore. Fade to white.Congreve writing Incognita would be so proud. Knowing nothing about Kaufman and his motivation for creating this film, I may like to ask: did you going into this work purposefully challenging yourself to make an ironic, comic, tragic romance? I don't know if I will live long enough to see another story come remotely close to dashing the rules of storytelling so ingeniously and perversely against the silver screen and still make me cry every time I watch. Let alone deconstruct itself before the critic ever has a chance, again and again."
263,"Synecdoche, New York",10,9 March 2010,A New Citizen Kane,"I'm not just throwing around Citizen Kane, because I honestly love it and when I watch it, I feel like the world is more stable. Manic and hard and full of misunderstanding, but stable. That's odd to compare to Synecdoche, NY, which seems to try to deconstruct all stability - yet I think they are about a similar theme and are similar in greatness. I won't go into the details of why I think this because I don't think anyone cares and if you do, you can probably figure it out. But I am amazed this film got made, I think it is fantastic, important, and I can watch it again and again. Sometimes I cry, sometimes I laugh. That's life, eh?"

Caden intimats to his wife that he had some little involvement in Pinter's well-known play ""The dumb waiter"". Death is indeed a recurring motif in this film, with a parade of burial funeral scenes (father, mother and other assortments of people close to the protagonist). Indeed, the ""last word"" of the film is something to the effect that the best play in one in which everybody dies. But death is not the only, nor even the most significant theme in this film.Initially, it would seem that this film is about the live theatre but it really is not, at least not in the sense of two good 2004 (coincidentally) movies ""Being Julia"" and ""The libertine"" (the latter happens to also feature Samantha Morton). Indeed the movie starts with Caden's revitalizing of ""Death of a salesman"" using a young cast, purportedly to enhance the poignancy of the story. The production is so successful that it earns him a prestigious award, a further stimulant to his creative talents, but also a curse of crippling pressure. What follows is a typical Kaufman outlandish satirical fantasy  Cotard launching an insanely huge project of mounting a production in a live-size replica of Manhattan in a gigantic warehouse. The development of this larger-than-life production carried on for 40 year, with endless casting interviews, maddening growth of crew to hundreds and thousands, incessant revisions of script until finally reality and illusion blur into one big surreal hallucination. You can see how such a neat device of a plot serves as a vassal to carry everything and anything the screen writer wants to say.The story actually runs on twin plots. Parallel to the often his frustrating creative endeavour, Caden's private life comprises equally frustrating relationships with several women, all portrayed by actresses of top-notch acting calibre.Playing Adele his equally talented wife (a painter) is Catherine Keener, which immediately brings to mind their earlier corroboration in ""Capote"" (2005). While this character disappears all too quickly as Adele deserts her husband to pursue her own career in Europe, it is a pivotal role. In the young cast of ""Death of a salesman"" mentioned is Claire (played by Michelle Williams who was Ennis' wife in ""Brokeback Mountain"") who becomes Caden's second wife, in a marriage that is no more successful than the first.The most important woman in Ceden's life is actually Hazel, the assistant who secretly admires him. While she goes off to marry and have her own life, she never really leaves him, and indeed comes back into his life, and becomes more symbolic than real. This fascinating character is portrayed by Samantha Morton, one of the best British actresses today (although less of a household name as Mirren and all the rest of them). Completing the list are three relatively minor roles, bit no less noteworthy. Hope Davis plays the eye-catching marriage consultant Madeleine Gravis. Emily Watson, as erotic as you have ever seen her on screen, is a chance encounter Tammy. Finally, veteran Dianne Wiest, in top form as ever, plays a symbolic double-role towards the end when the film has entered deep into the realm of the surreal.In the final analysis, it's all about Caden, a creative genius plagued by neurotic doubts and frustration, as well as depressed by a faltering private life. But this is only the beginning. What Kaufman tries to say in the eccentric piece of cinematic enigma, sometimes obscurely and sometimes less so, can fill volumes."
265,"Synecdoche, New York",10,20 November 2009,A Masterpiece!,"Surrealistic and strange at times, this movie takes the craft into a whole new level of externalizing intra-personal and interpersonal issues. The plot weaves in surprising ways, and yet it all makes profound sense in terms of the inner world of the main character. Philip Seymour Hoffman's protean talents are showcased, along with an excellent supporting cast. Charlie Kaufman, who has written many original and compelling scripts, has outdone himself here, with a film so universal in terms of the human condition. As many geniuses, Mr. Kaufman is probably ahead of his time in ways, and may attract an ""art house"" audience for this film. His ambition and risk taking in this film was a great inspiration, and the contents could be the subject of seminars and interest groups. Funny and tragic, sometimes simultaneously, this movie is a Rosetta Stone for understanding the creative process, human relationships, the cycles of life, achievements and disappointments, and everything encountered on the road of life."

267,"Synecdoche, New York",8,28 October 2009,"An ode to the hopeless, the dry and weary pessimists.","What I got from this strangely unique and abstract film was this exploration of one sad man who is aware of his own mortality but never moves on from his own tragedy. I just find this character very fascinating. He knows of his own death, so he decides to make an impact by making his most honest play - an autobiography that progresses with his life.Then how does a man move on when he constantly witnesses and even directs a repetition of his own life? He reflects and waits for some idea. He waits for some breakthrough. At the same time, he wallows in regret. As a result, his character just stays the same. This film has quite an interesting, albeit bleak, view on life. It was pretty much summed up by the priest's exhortation in the near end. This film, like the play, offers utterly brutal honesty.Even though I don't exactly believe in the fatalistic views of this movie, it did speak to me. And it touched on thoughts that I have had on existence, the eternal, and the infinite.Now this is an incredibly well crafted film, almost labyrinthine. I must also end with the warning. Synecdoche, New York will stress you out, and the thoughts it will bring will stay for awhile."
268,"Synecdoche, New York",10,16 October 2009,Intriguing and very sad hallucination about conditions of contemporary art,"Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche New York is an intriguing film. Most of the many commentators of it seem to wonder at how it relates to real life and death. It does that too, wonderfully  and intriguingly.But what, in my opinion, makes this film absolutely original, not to say absolutely singular, is that it deals in total, box-office-ignoring earnest with the conditions of art. It is not quite certain that the main character is a hypochondriac, growingly depressed and confused theatre director, it could just as well be art itself. All the symptoms this poor man shows could easily be applied to contemporary art in all its different forms, blisters and all.The question Synecdoche seems to put to me is a somewhat juvenile, but nevertheless, or perhaps just therefore, essential one: What can art really express, or be? Can it express, or be, everything, like a totality of something, like a life, or like death, limitlessly  by means that is so much less total, and so much more limited, than what is expressed or meant to be? In this disturbingly hallucinatory film art  theatre producing as it is  grows big as life itself, or even bigger, as it seems to swallow it up bit for bit.Also the title of the film is something to wonder at: Synecdoche  to express something bigger by a smaller part of it  or  to express a smaller part by the whole of it. So wonderfully apt, for once.Whether you relate to life or to art, this is a very, very sad film. How can I feel so excited by it then? Is it because of its truthfulness?"
269,"Synecdoche, New York",6,26 August 2009,Black comedy artwork gets lost in depression,"It seems like somewhere, about an hour into the film, that what began as existential 'comedy', with brilliant satire on daily events and relations, turns too far inward and leaves us with very little other than sadness. I think too much introspection, too much truth, may have gotten the better of a good thing. The first half is filled with a lot of really good moments, one liners and jaw-droppers, a lot of cute and disquieting things. I think there was some shortage of script or something as, after an hour, the story seems to cycle through a lot of similar territory. Instead of a celebration of life, in all it's madness, this movie will leave you depressed about life. I don't think the quirkiness matched up well with the greyness."
270,"Synecdoche, New York",10,19 August 2009,"Crushed Ambition, New Doors","**** (out of 4) By Aaron DumontI'm not sure where to begin on this one. In fact, I'm not sure if I'm really up to writing on it. But after the seventh viewing, I think it's good to take a breath and attempt to let out my feelings on Synecdoche, New York - a Proustian, Godardian, Brechtian meta-masterpiece. This movie is a fantasia of all the colors and sides of human nature. It is a dreamscape, realist, social-satire. It is a perfect humanity-simulation that sets up a hopeless array of hopeful people among life-devouring art the same way T.S. Eliot set up all the world's heroes into a foggy battle in The Waste Land, or how James Joyce set up a group of normal men and women into a gloriously uneventful topographical trek in Ulysses. There are distinctly three acts in Synecdoche, New York, each of them stepping further and further into the universal troubles that keep us all together. The first act starts as an impulsively unsettling, quirky portrait of a family in the midst of death and a disintegrating relationship. The family is alienated. As they continue with life they grow more weary and more worried about what will happen next. The family is surrounded by a series of characters who intertwine in and around the various stories and experiences throughout the film. They are all actors in the play, who then become actors to play them, and then actors to play the actors. As the film sprawls more and more, identity, emotion and humanity become lost in translation and art, which highlights the sad insignificance of all of their eventual, inevitable deaths. This all gets run further down the increasingly hallucinogenic, seemingly endless stretch of the fading human condition and devastation, leading up to the end - a gorgeous culmination of the past events, ideas, themes and styles this movie had meticulously, masterfully shown and constructed. This is the final act. As the end approaches, its nihilist tones contract into an insane, quiet, infinitely devastating humanism that lands the entire multi-dimensional, sprawling, unwieldy metaphysical fantasy / horror / celebration-of -the-mundane -while-being -as-least-mundane -as-possible drama into a full circle. Fade to white, not black. The end is a rebirth that leaves viewers to wonder if the play is finished or not.Mysteries like these are highlighted here. But one thing is certain - as the average life gets snuffed out of memory and existence, the circle of life continues on. This is how real life works, too. And if you can except that, then you can really live your life. A movie that can give you this effect and sentiment should at least be respected. Synecdoche, New York is on an entirely different level. It is an actual masterpiece, one that retains a truly organic, visceral philosophy while letting itself off into dreams, reality, love, hate, myth, loneliness, et cetera. These are new doors, ones that should be experienced."
271,"Synecdoche, New York",8,19 August 2009,Look hard and you'll find the genius,"If you're familiar with Charlie Kaufman's work, then you understand that ""Synecdoche, New York"" is going to tell a story that's abstract, that feels normal but is completely out of the ordinary, and rarely feel like it's making sense. Now that he's directing his own film this time, Kaufman, the brilliant but challenging writer behind ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation,"" has creative control to create yet another layer of bizarre, making this film even harder to understand in one sitting. The truth is that ""Synecdoche"" is a fascinating movie for the small (and ever-shrinking) club of people who like watching movies they don't understand so that they can try and understand them. Anyone who tries hard enough can begin to break down the ideas generating this story, but it's not a film for the passive viewer who wants a traditional story told in a conventional way.The film is about the life of Caden Cotard (Hoffman), an apparently ill middle-aged director who is married and has a six-year-old child that leave him. Feeling lonely and believing he's dying, he receives a grant to work on a play and giant warehouse to stage it in, and he decides he is going to create something that will attempt to make sense of life, namely his, as well as love and death. The combination of his own delusions and the absurdity of that feat -- to create the ultimate work of art accurately reflecting life -- is a good portion of what makes this film so unfathomable yet so fascinating.Left emotionally blindsided by his wife (Catherine Keener), Caden is surrounded by the temptations of the other women he works with (there's not but one male supporting actor) such as the box office secretary who has always loved him (Samantha Morton) and the star of his last production (Michelle Williams), Caden can't make sense of his feelings and uses his art to do it. He does so for years upon years, time jumping forward at strange intervals, revealing more of who Caden really is.Kaufman is all about the visual manifestation of thoughts and ideas, which make his film so abstract. As a director, he does a very nice job of making the film seem like it happens in a natural way despite its absurdities. His scenes are very short and move quickly and there's no map guiding you or leash to pull you along. It's frustrating and deprives you of ever having a truly deep and satisfactory ""aha"" moment, but it also gives you free reign to take from it what you will, even if some parts left you dumbstruck.""Synecdoche"" is a film about the life of a man trying to make a play of his life of him making a play of his life -- to give you a sense of what you're up against watching this film. In that way it is both astute and ultimately meaningless, but unquestionably heartfelt and honest. Kaufman doesn't do this to win creativity points, he does it to find unique ways of exploring and understanding the traditional themes of love and mortality in the hopes of coming across something truly profound. It's exactly what Caden tries to do. Making complete sense of life is futile, but making a concerted effort is art. ~Steven CVisit my site: http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"
272,"Synecdoche, New York",7,19 August 2009,Big,"This is a strange film, which could have easily descended into self indulgence, but magically held its own, probably due to the now superb, (passim), Philip Seymour Hoffman and perhaps to the ever hubba hubba Christine Keener.I myself felt captured by the sadness of a missing daughter, but this evaporated ever so quickly as the film, and the set, mushroomed. No going back. No standing still. A new adventure at every corner.Weird. (I can spell it Nigel), but pretty damn good.Ron (Viewed 26May09)Hi IMDb. This is a filler line. Total boocksll (anag)."
273,"Synecdoche, New York",10,20 July 2009,A difficult meticulous maze made with boldness,"I don't think I can ever really recommend this film except to very select people. This is one of the densest most visionary and well crafted films I've ever seen. There's so much good here that the bad (in my opinion) stands out like a sore thumb and winds up being the only things I can talk clearly about so I'll mention two things that didn't work for me. The flower petal falling off the arm of his daughter at the death scene felt too artsy for arts sake and the house that is perpetually on fire seemed a bit silly and had no real meaning for me in context of the rest of the film. I know the movie is about a man living in a half dream half reality but this movie still has a certain timbre, a feel and those two things felt out of place for me. Considering what the rest of the movie is, just picking 2 things out is pretty extraordinary.I remember when this movie came out and it was getting very lukewarm mixed reviews. I think I read one critic that highly recommended it and the rest, now that I've seen the movie, probably felt in over their head. This is not a movie that can easily be talked about or written about. It's something special for sure. I don't even really understand all of what I saw but I know I felt something very deep from it. There's much to appreciate, the easiest is the visuals which Kauffman does very well. That it feels like you're watching someone going through his very real life but the dreamlike qualities blend in without taking over is an accomplishment. He uses time very well. I often feel like whole years go by and I have no idea what happened in that time and this movie highlights this experience. The story ebbs and flows through different chapters in this character Kaden's life and we see him getting older and older. He's a sad sack and I feel for the guy every step of the way even if I find myself resenting his lack of fortitude and willingness to live joyfully on some level. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is just amazing. The guy is great exposing vulnerability and emotions openly. He's so very good as well as the rest of the cast.I think it's a credit to this film, it being executed so well, that I wound up thinking more about myself watching it than I did about the characters and the storyline. This movie feels like a meditation or exercise of some sort. It's heavy and high minded the way Kauffman presents his visual ideas and lays out the story. I find it very difficult to think of any other films I've seen that have anything closely resembling this film (you know, if you liked ""Die Hard"" you'll love this film ;). I think it could be easy to dismiss it as an art film or disregard it as too confusing. I didn't find it too confusing or overly artsy for arts sake. It's got a lot going on and the emotions I got from watching it were very deep and made me think about my life. It's a very challenging film. I will be watching it again in the future...when I'm ready."
274,"Synecdoche, New York",7,29 May 2009,"Kaufman does it again, this time in the director's seat...","Many label Charlie Kaufman's work as pretentious because it's smart, different, and doesn't follow the average formula that most are accustomed to. Kaufman has written and produced such films as Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, & Being John Malcovich... However his newest project, 'Synecdoche' is his directorial debut. Kaufman proves yet again that he is far from pretentious... he is a genius.In 'Synecdoche', Phillip Seymour Hoffman, one of my personal favorites, plays Caden, a theater director who takes on the challenge of creating his final work of art in a giant warehouse in Manhatten. As he works out the out's and in's his new masterpiece, Caden slowly builds a replica of the city as he knows it inside the warehouse and the play becomes almost a mockery of the lives of his crew and himself and he even casts someone to play himself and they people who are working on set. Meanwhile, Caden deals with on-going, almost self indulgent suffering of the pain from his wife and daughter, Adele & Olive, leaving him to live in Germany. This synopsis merely grazes the deeply moving and complicated plot that makes 'Synecdoche' the insanely original new triumph from Charlie Kaufman.Both Kaufman fans and those who have a deep appreciation for high art cinema will enjoy this film. However, I would imagine that everyone else will loathe it. Synecdoche' is by no means an easy film in any sense. Again this is not your average movie or even your average art film, what we have here is something so original and so daring that it will be unable to be compared to any film and a piece of fine cinema that will last forever."
275,"Synecdoche, New York",9,25 May 2009,perhaps too clever for some not wanting a challenge,"This is a dark, absurd and tragicomical fun-house of a film that requires you to get lost within its interior logic, and wander about in this grand, pathetic and solipsistic, psychological landscape. It requires of the viewer an active and open mind, willing to follow the story wherever it may lead, and able to read the subtle but plentiful clues that are strewn along the way.In this, his directorial debut, Charlie Kaufman has created an epic, uncompromised masterpiece on par with Gilliam's Brazil, Cronenburg's Naked Lunch, or more recently Anthony Hopkin's Slipstream. They are filled with the same blend of dirty realism and magic surrealism that play off each other and make these stories much more than the sum of their parts. Synecdoche, NY is perhaps too clever for some not wanting a challenge, and too heavy for others with weak spines. Let them watch television. The rest of us know that the reward is in the riddle, and the effort is worth the exhaustion."
276,"Synecdoche, New York",5,21 May 2009,Heavy stuff,"Great movie, surrealistic, absurd, some humor. How the theater piece and the real life float into each other at the end of the movie, is magnificently directed. The movie does make someone think about life for sure: we're all little humans with the same issues amongst other little humans... However at moments it looses its tension somewhat, and there are moments the movie gets somewhat repetitive. Cutting some of the scenes perhaps could have done a better job. The movie is an absolute must-see for the Woody Allen and David Lynch fans between us, be it that I miss a little extra humor, now it is rather depressing. Not really a nice entertaining piece to start a night out with your girl friend before going to the disco, prepare yourself for some heavy stuff..."
277,"Synecdoche, New York",9,20 May 2009,Brutal.,"To anyone with the slightest degree of knowledge on modern cinema and its cult leaders for independent, art-infused cinema, Charlie Kaufman is a name that will surely ring synonymous with either a loud breath of despair or a wide-eyed look of awe. Indeed, bar only a few art-house writers and directors who regularly strike it lucky in the realm of the multiplex, Kaufman is quite like no other in his ability to craft works that polarise audience dramatically, regardless of their background and/or conception of film as a medium of art and/or entertainment. To say that his work is without merit however would be a severe underestimation and discredit to the film-maker; while often neglecting to offer viewers a chance at traditional structures, narratives and other forms of cinematic catharsis, Kaufman's work essentially lives or dies on its ability to reach past any disgruntled awkwardness felt by the audience and replace it with an initial splurge of bemusement or stupor soon followed by a cool breeze o revelation over repeated viewings.Having dealt rather firmly and in stark detail through previous films on stories so intertwined and contorted you'd think the projectionist was playing mind-games for a cheap laugh; Kaufman here strives to achieve a similar effect only on a much grander scale. Set against the backdrop of downtown New York where lead character and disillusioned misery personified Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman) soon builds his version of the city within that very city in order to stage a real-time play based around his life and the people he shares his surroundings with; Synecdoche, New York is another one of those cerebral tongue-twisters that Charlie has so far established himself to be rather fond of. Where in previous movies Kaufman has delved into minds of minds, screenplays of screenplays and memories of memoriesthis time he concocts a story that more or less attempts to do all three within a city within a city (within a city, within a city). This somewhat jarring, matryoshka-effect will no doubt leave detractors of the director's work experiencing relapses of yawns and irritated, frequent checks of the watch; and to a certain extent, it is not hard to see even the sternest of fans of either Kaufman of this brand of art-house cinema to be a little dissatisfied too.Yet taken within the context of Synecdoche's multi-layered, disjointed and surreal world bridging the gaps between art, reality and fiction, there lay details that some will find resolve in that others simply won't have the time for. And this is where offering any sort of analysis on a work of this magnitude and scale becomes borderline redundantyou see, much like Kaufman's work here, the experience of being transported to Caden's capsulated reality with all its twists and turns in time and metaphysical space is one that will be purely subjective to most (if not all) viewers. Indeed, there is no denying the ambitious nature of the feature's scope and artistic merit, yet taken as a Saturday night flick just won't do the movie any justice. Synecdoche, New York is a living, breathing and refined account of life, death, love, loss and failure rolled into a convoluted package sent walking to a melancholic melody that never quite reaches its overdue resolve until it's too late. For some audiences, this harsh and bold, daring expression of such elements of life will be welcomed regardless of the movie's aesthetical sense of self-gratification or lack of compassion for everyone else.Yet for all its grandiosity and larger than life, meditative statements on life, the mind and the passing of time in all its enigmatic transiencedespite how impressive the sky line may cast itself upon Cotard's magnum opusthere is no audience to witness any second of it. Instead, the play sneaks on by without causing alarm to anyone but those involved; the mind, running rampant, talking and amusing itself to the point of a deluded sense of nirvana. In this vein, Kaufman's interpretation here never quite moves into geara dress rehearsal depicted over two long hours of introspection and careful examination, Synecdoche, New York only ever seems gratified in pleasing itself. There is no need for an audience, and therefore you are secondary and almost always left to sit on the sidelines to merely appreciate the work as an artistic and multi-layered attempt at something larger than it eventually becomes. And yet, much like Kaufman's similarly rippling, resonant piece Adaptation, New York here is painted in such colours because that's how its centerpiece witnesses it. This is a lonely, bitter, and somewhat enlightened work dimmed by the excess of decay and neurotic chaos that surrounds it. Indeed, not everyone will enjoy the presence of Caden (some might even consider taking an indefinite vacation from him), but some will perhaps love him for what he is. Which admittedly may not be an embodiment of ethereal perfection, but can at least attest to being something else; honest, resonating and brutal. Brutal, brutal, brutal.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"
278,"Synecdoche, New York",7,15 May 2009,"Dizzying, downbeat existential conundrum featuring the Big Apple","A dense but arresting film which is determined to be serious if only in its content. One is tempted to ask whether this film would have been better served had he decided to use a separate director. I would love to know what David O. Russell, the director of I *heart* Huckabees, would have made of this script.In fact my yearning for a separate director goes beyond longing for a sense of perspective on Kaufmann's audacious, downbeat, existentially self-consuming dramatic essay. Watching the film one gets an impression of Kaufmann having used other director's shots to mount his story - nothing flashy or 'patented', just a sense that he'd put himself in the position of some other. Rather like the characters in the story in fact.Philip Seymour Hoffmann earns the Oscar that he did in fact win (via Capote) here. It's just his sort of niche, insecure and lumpen; he doesn't disintegrate so much as mould or melt - his trick is to manage to wring pity from us despite a sense of disgust. The rest of cast is premium and doesn't disappoint. Samantha Morton's Hazel is prima inter pares by virtue of her character.It can't help but be an art-house movie, despite its good humour, something which gets the better of it in the final, metastasising half hour. But it is a wonder of warped-dimensional plotting and food for thought even when you've lost a grip on what's 'actually' going on. 7/10"

In a previous review listed here, rossthejibbs says, ""I guess what I really have to complain about is that it never goes anywhere. It feels like nothing fits together and I can't get involved in any of the characters..."" You're right, but don't know it. That's the ""brutal truth"" that Kaufman is illustrating in this movie about life...with themes of loneliness, regret, and events passing by. His wife Adele saying to him that love is a projection...that no one can really get involved in anyone. Each of us separate beings unsuccessfully trying to connect to each other. The struggle.This film can invoke the viewer to question their own life, regrets, connecting with people, waiting for death, purpose in life.Kaufman isn't brilliant, I don't think anyone is brilliant. He's just focused. And if the viewer is focused, they will understand the movie. You don't have to be spoon-fed a story to make sense of it. How dare Hollywood train us to look at a film a certain way. Die."
280,"Synecdoche, New York",,7 March 2009,Last Film on the Earth,"In Charlie Kaufman's scripts, however different and polyhedral they are, always two things are described: Life as it really is and the image of it we create and display (also called Art). Or maybe this is really one, like two sides of Moebius loop. ""Synecdoche, New York"", Kaufman's Opus magnum for today, brings this loop to it's logical end.Caden Cotard, provincial theater director, after discovering he is affected by strange neural disease, maybe terminal, undergoes self- imposed Kafkaesque trial, as result of which his personality literally goes down in flames. On the verge of it he is starting to reconstruct his life as a stage play, hiring actors to play himself, women he at some point loved or has been loved by and finally falling from Director's chair to mere episodic character who could in fact never exist.Labyrinthine and elaborate, ""Synecdoche"" is perfectly clear at all times, which is marvelous taking into account all the indistinctnesses used to create it. Muffled cues, transient frames, innumerable labels, notes and scraps flying through the screen create Nabokovian experience (""The Real Life of Sebastian Knight"" specifically), also not by accident.In Synecdoche, Kaufman is once again pulling the trick that left us jaw- fallen after Adaptation, but on much greater scale: following the development of the main hero we try and cannot miss how the transformations he undergoes reflect such of the movie and the author himself. The latter is not breaking the fourth wall, but strictly proving no such thing did ever exist.Intricacy is delicacy, but what emotion it aims to create in the viewer's mind? We go through the full spectrum - family happiness, family discord, fear of death, longing of death, but at the end there is none. And concerning the previous paragraph, where does this take us?Having mastered The Love and The Misery, Kaufman himself is in neither. The struggle between the lover and the topologist has ended - the victory is ultimate. The fact it has no taste is ultimately irrelevant. There's nothing more to say... There's nothing more to say."
