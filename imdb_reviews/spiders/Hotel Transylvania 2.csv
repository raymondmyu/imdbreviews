0,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,27 September 2015,Surprised that this film is great indeed for kids and adults too.,"Hotel Transylvania 2 is a 2015 American 3D computer animated fantasy-comedy film. The film is the sequel to the 2012 film Hotel Transylvania.Hotel Transylvania 2 takes place seven years after the first film, with the hotel now open to human guests. Mavis and Johnny have a young son named Dennis, whose lack of any vampire abilities worries his grandfather Dracula. When Mavis and Johnny go on a visit to Johnny's parents, Dracula calls his friends to help him make Dennis a vampire. However, an unexpected visit from Dracula's old-school human-hating dad, Vlad soon turns things upside-down.As an adult,I quite enjoyed watching this excellent movie. If you are looking for real Comedy/Adventure movie with perfect action from start to finish,then you should see this masterpiece movie."
1,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,6 October 2015,Number 1 movie in most countries.,"""Hotel Transylvania"" is truly an excellent family movie with all elements of success included: good script,perfect entertainment,wonderful direction and great comedy.I saw it with my girlfriend after hearing this film has been achieving international success.Honestly ""Hotel Transylvania"" was extremely funny for adults and the movie theater was crowded. People were looking for a real comedy that would make them forget their own problems and the movie was absolutely hilarious from the beginning till the end.The voice acting was stunning and honestly this lovely film is worth seeing for all ages,you will move into another fantastic world for 90 minutes.I am not surprised at all why this movie has been number 1 in most counties around the world.Well Done!."
2,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,6 February 2016,Disappointed..,I am a huge fan of animation.and i liked the previous part very much. So i had high expectations on this movie.but it really disappointed me. I mean the animation quality seemed to be below the standard . The comedy didn't workout as it was planned.some jokes were old and repeatedly Used.conversations seemed to be funny now and then but not to impress a lot Story line is flat.and what was supposed to be a visual treat didn't even end up being An appetizer.believe me when i say i am disappointed in a animation movie. It has all the potential to be a very good sequel but somehow they have managed Make it a average movie with poor story telling. Watch it if you want to kill time otherwise not advised
3,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,5 October 2015,Not As Good As the Original But Fun!,"It is not as good as the original. But it is still very funny. And really shows Adam Sandler who has starred in some flops recently, still has his charm as Dracula.With his girl now grown up and married Mavis to human Johnny. Played respectively by Selena Gomez and Andy Samberg. As they become parents later on to a boy named Dennis. With curly red hair and Dracula hopes he becomes a vampire like his grandfather.In order to prove he is a vampire with his only child and son in law to visit his human grandparents, Dracula and friends like Frankenstein must take off with young Dennis, without Mavis knowing about it.Mavis gets to discover a bit of the outside world along with doing things that she never did like ride a bicycle or drink slur pees. Much to Johnny's amusement.Still it is about accepting people no matter what in their hearts. Not just with words. There is a ""cameo"" with Mel Brooks as Dracula's estranged father. Not as good as the first one but still fun."
4,Hotel Transylvania 2,2,6 July 2016,not good enough,"The second movie, after the very good Hotel Transylvania, disappoints in every way possible. First of all, the time table of the movie is annoyingly messed up. It moves way too quickly and it just feels like you are watching flashes or rather moments from another movie. The main idea is appealing, though the final result doesn't reach the wanted result. The funny moments were few and they are not enough to save the movie. In fact, it makes you think if you are watching a movie or Fifth Harmony's promotion film, as the only moments the movie gets a little interesting is when their songs are on. Even the ending was kind of odd. Where did the kid learn all these moves when moments ago he was a scared baby? Plus, there was no surprise for the final twist. So, 2 out of 10."
5,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,26 September 2015,it's a really funny movie,"Well, many people says this movie sucks but I think they are saying it because Adam Sandler is in the movie but I think this is a good movie, it's funny, is not trying to be something it is not because is not a movie with a super message obviously no, it knows that is just funny, the animation is beautiful, the mayority of the characters are OK but it have some flaws and they are: it have some characters that are in the movie just because they have to be on it but they really unnecessary and boring characters. The opening scenes feel very accelerated and many things pass so fast that you can't pay attention to all of them. I would say that is as good as the first one but I think that isn't better and they are in the same place, none is better than the other. Well I'm going to give it an 8.2 of 10, it's a good movie that is really enjoyable to watch."
6,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,25 September 2015,Still a fun entry but is slightly tainted,"For cartoons, Genndy Tartakovsky has had his hands in and on a lot of peoples' favorite shows. There's something about Tartakovsky's vision of cartoons that breathes life into every movement that is made by them. Tartakovsky made his directorial debut with Hotel Transylvania (2012) and although it was not universally renowned, made people found it to be a fun family movie with a well-developed story, energetic animation and colorful characters. Plus even though it dealt with Halloween related characters, the idea wasn't to scare but make light of the characters and the lore of which they originated from. Here we are with its sequel and although it does keep several elements from the original the same, some things have changed and other parts should have changed. Thankfully, this sequel isn't brought down a whole lot, but it is enough to notice the differences in what should've been focused on more.The story to this installment revolves around Dracula (Adam Sandler) trying to bring out the inner vampire of his hybrid grandson Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) brought upon by newly wedded couple/parents Mavis (Selena Gomez) and Jonathan (Andy Samberg). The reason for this is fearing that if their son has no vampire blood flowing in him anywhere, Mavis would end up leaving the hotel for good. Although the premise isn't as obvious, unfortunately the execution ends up feeling very similar to that of the first (plot wise). Dracula claims he is more open minded now but still clings to his past and tries to hide his true ambitions. In some respects, this particular play out moots the point of the first film altogether. Once Drac accepted Jonathan into his world, he should've been prepared for what came after. It just makes it feel like he didn't learn from before. The writing group for this entry shrunk in size. For the first film, five writers were involved. Here only two were, of which only one of them were from the original five.The one from the original five was Robert Smigel, a writer for multiple Saturday Night Live episodes. The other writer credited for this film was Adam Sandler and unfortunately it shows too. How? Two words, potty humor. Yes, and it sticks out like a soar thumb. Hotel Transylvania (2012) did have some silly moments but none of the comedy required potty humor. That's not to say all of the scenes don't work, but there are scenes where experienced viewers will be able to point out the scenes that Adam Sandler had wrote in. It's just not necessary. Of all problems with this and a familiar plot, that's it. For the moments that don't included immature humor, the rest of the comedy bits are new and contemporary, which is having the characters play off of their own flaws and personalities or trying to have them figure out social media. Drac can't seem to understand that to use a touch screen, you can't have long fingernails. He'll get it I'm sure.There's also new character additions to the cast, which is great although sometimes it can sink a film if it becomes over saturated. All the original characters voiced by Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, David Spade and Steve Buscemi all sound exactly as they should and still play off one another well. Even Keegan-Michael Key who replaces CeeLo Green as Murray from the first film practically sounds the same too. Some of the new voice actors to jump on board or receive more attention are Sadie Sandler as Winnie (one of Wayne's children), Jon Lovitz as a ""phantom of the opera"" type character and the comedy guru himself, Mel Brooks playing Vlad, Dracula's father. It really is nice to see a bunch of new and old voice actors work together though. Plus, a star talent like Brooks isn't wasted either. His appearance isn't as long as everyone else's roles but he comes in at the best time.Again since this production was headed by Tartakovsky, the animation and character designs are nothing but great. The character designs are all unique and have intricate texture detailing. Alan Hawkins who worked as an animator for the first film serves a senior animation supervisor for this entry. Considering his past work being on projects like Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (2009) and Arthur Christmas (2011), Hawkins feels like a great collaborator for Tartakovsky's vision. The film score produced by Devo member Mark Mothersbaugh continues his usual work but again fails to provide his listeners with an actual soundtrack for download. The score itself matches the scenes well and portrays the right emotion but it's weird that Mothersbaugh can provide a score for Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (2009) or The Lego Movie (2014) but can't for these films. Why so selective in distribution?It's not a huge step down from the original but it is noticeable. The sequel does maintain all the character relations and chemistry while adding in new ones like Drac's father voiced by Mel Brooks. It also keeps the same great animation and music. Unfortunately although the premise feels new, the execution is very much parallel to the first film in some ways. Plus with Adam Sandler now active in writing the script, some his childish annoying potty humor got in the recipe as well and it's obvious as all get out."
7,Hotel Transylvania 2,3,28 December 2015,I really enjoyed it before it got problematic. #Spoilers,"Okay, I really enjoyed at least the first half of the movie - it was really entertaining; it was funny and had quite a lot of adult humor. So I completely got the whole keep the families separate from each other ""If the child lives with me, they can live a normal life"". The movie did attempt to address mixed families (interracial families) (white = humans, black = monsters). I could also sense the narrative of homophobia (the child is shamed and is laughed at for liking the ""cake monster"") which was not addressed ONCE.Moreover, what the f*ck is up with the heteronormative story line in the second half of this movie. I can't even put to words my irritation at the fact that every single character was like, ""ooh you got the eyes for that girl wolf"" and sh*t like that. HE IS FIVE! This movie actually made me angry. I was going to rate it 7/10, then 5/10. Final rating: 3/10."
8,Hotel Transylvania 2,9,25 September 2015,"This movie is hilarious, for kids AND for adults!","Just got back from seeing it in theaters, and let me tell you, there were several moments when just the kids would laugh, and moments when just the adults would laugh, and even moments when everybody laughed. This is coming from a guy who doesn't watch a lot of ""kid"" movies, and I can tell Adam Sandler wanted more than just kids to enjoy it, so he threw in child-raising jokes, nipple jokes, and a few other jokes and themes that go right over your average kid's head. And of course there's silliness plentiful for the kiddies to enjoy. If you're reading reviews, you should already be familiar with the plot, which in a nutshell for those who aren't, is basically the two kids from the first one are older and married and have a kid, who the grandfather, Count Dracula, hopes is a Dracula/monster like his own bloodline, but it doesn't seem to be the case. So family relationships are slightly strained in this movie as Dracula wonders if he'll be helping to raise his vampire grandson, or watching his human grandson and human son-in-law and vampire daughter move away and leaving him behind alone in his hotel, to go live with *gasp* HUMANS. So on top of it being hilarious for everybody, there's a lot more to it as well. Obviously if you're a fan of the first Hotel Transylvania, it's a guarantee you'll enjoy this sequel. The style of animation is exaggerated, highly sporadic, like a human gas molecule with ADHD and an IV inserted coffee bag. There is a lot going on in almost every scene, and with the characters behaving so hyper, it may take a couple viewings to take in all in. The humor is quick, very in your face, but welcoming. And trust me, humor is a-plenty. There are a few minor flaws; while tailored to two separate audiences, obviously there will be moments where one side will feel out of place. Either a child will cock their head to the side in puzzlement and maybe laugh but only because the adults are, or an adult will think to themselves ""well that was just weird."" And yes it's mostly a kid's movie so much of everything is easy to swallow. Go see it, even if you don't have kids, it's a fun, easy-going flick that's sure to make you jiggle with joy like Blobby. The characters are fun and diverse as before, humor is constant, and for those sticklers out there (you know who you are), the plot exists and it flows sufficiently enough to follow, and at a reasonable pace. So bust out your popcorn and brain juice, and enjoy this light-hearted comedy."
9,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,30 September 2015,Decent but there is a part that bugs me,"So I just saw Hotel Transylvania 2. And yes, it is funnier and more enjoyable than the first Hotel Transylvania. I just have one complaint. One little thing undermines the entire moral of the film.The whole film is about how it doesn't matter what you are and that those that love you will accept you. The whole film is about how even if he is human Dennis will be accepted. However Mavis gives serious consideration to moving to California and nearly does even though Dennis AND Jonathan clearly want to stay in Transylvania.Here's the spoiler. Toward the end of the film it's revealed that Dennis actually is a vampire. His vampirism emerges when his best friend / possible future romantic interest, the little werewolf girl is in trouble. Here's the problem. The whole film has this ham handed message about acceptance and how it doesn't matter what Dennis is. Yet it does. It really, really does. As soon as things calm down he asks ""Since I'm a vampire does this mean we can stay at the hotel?"" And Mavis says ""Yes."" Just yes. Nothing about how she might have stayed if she had just known and accepted that's what he really wanted. This ""cute"" moment under cuts the entire message of the film.I know that as an adult I'm probably over analyzing but it kind of bothers me because otherwise it's a very sweet and funny film.I actually don't mind Dennis becoming a vampire. That was kind of cute, especially the reason as to how. What bugged me was ""Since I'm a vampire does this mean I can stay ant the hotel?"" and Mavis says ""Yes."" So much for what he is not mattering. What he is should not have anything to do with if they stay at the hotel or not. That undermined everything!Since there are so many complaints about Hotel Transylvania 2 I will give it this one nod of appreciation. I am very grateful that the cartoon Dracula can shapeshift into multiple forms. I miss depictions of Dracula that can become more than just a bat. Little things like that please me."
10,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,26 September 2015,A Satisfying Sequel,"More monster characters, more amusing moments and more exciting parties have upgraded an additional star rating for the hotel this Halloween season. The animation starts off immediately from where it ended previously, progresses in a moderate pacing, filled with numerous hilarious moments though with the usual ridiculous Adam Sandler type of humors, it's not overly used and creates just sufficient amount of laughter. The message about to change and to adapt in order to fit oneself into a new environment is well simplified to cater children's understanding while the eye popping, colorful visual effects together with pop styles emerging into the story are well crafted to make young adults feel like kids. Overall, the sequel is an energetic animation compared to its predecessor, heart-warming and certainly a satisfying family goers movie to enjoy."
11,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,7 October 2015,Drac's pack is back+1,"When I first heard this movie was announced I did not know what to think. The first one was entertaining, witty and brought a new spin the old story of a dad not thinking the ""slacker dude"" is good enough for his daughter. There have been many occasions where sequels either aren't as good as the original or wear out the original concept too much. This movie thankfully does neither of those things. From start to finish this movie feels fresh and unrestricted by the expectations set by the first.If you've seen any of the previews you already know the plot. Johnathan, the human from the first movie, and Mavis, Dracula's own daughter, get married and have a child which they are raising in Dracula's hotel. Count Dracula, proud of his own heritage as a monster, wishes for his grandson becoming a vampire like himself and is concerned when he does not show signs of being a monster. He also wishes to raise him the traditional monster way. This of coarse begins to clash with the human teachings from the other half of his family and cause the conflict of the entire movie. Said conflict is whether or not young Dennis should be raised in the hotel or in the monster-less safe human world. Though this plot sounds like the first one remixed, I feel it is more of a continuation as good sequels should be. The animation is on par if you've seen the first movie, which is not bad. The animation of the first movie was active and full of life and that same attention drawing quality animation is here again. Everything in this movie flows to an unseen rhythm and nothing feels stiff or artificial. That's not saying there aren't a few scenes that are more dynamic then the first movie, because there is, but as a whole if you liked the animation from the first movie you will like it here as well.As far as the characters go everyone is as kooky as they were in the first movie. Adam Sandler's brilliant comedic version of Dracula taking center stage, leading the still funny renditions of classic movie monsters. As Dracula, Sandler is just the right amount of hammy without it being off-putting. Such a performance makes it seem as if the over the top way movie monsters acted in our films was just the ""old way"" of acting for them.The mood and colors used in the movie are a great mix of themes. The moody backdrops with dank dark colors fit the horror movie style the characters in the movie originate from perfectly. Then add some bright colors to mimic the happy comedic tone of the movie. Combining this together you have a brilliant mix of happy and spooky that made both the first movie and this one enjoyable for everyone. When it comes down to it Hotel Transylvania 2 is a heartwarming family movie full of comedy that everyone, whether you're big or small, can enjoy."
12,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,26 September 2015,'Hotel Transylvania 2' is hilarious,"Wildly funny, bursting with energy and capped off with a sweet touch of family love 'Hotel Transylvania 2' brings it home for the audience young and old.Poor Dracula Adam Sandler  voice is very concerned that his grandson Dennis Asher Blinkoff voice isn't showing any signs of becoming a vampire. His concern deepens when he also sees the possibility that his most beloved daughter Mavis Selena Gomez  voice may leave Hotel Transylvania and move into the world of humans. So Dracula puts Jonathon through a monster boot camp when his daughter and son in law take a trip to the human world to visit the human in laws.The entire experience turns into a giant explosive and hilarious event of one cataclysmic disaster after another. Capping it all off is the appearance of great granddad and devoted human hater Vlad Mel Brooks  voice. But in the end Dennis finally shows signs that he is indeed half human and half vampire and there is a very happy birthday celebration that brings humans and monsters together at the Hotel Transylvania.This is a fun movie designed mainly for children but when I watched it I and other adults added significantly to the steady stream of solid laughter. Kudos to Sony Pictures Animation for giving us this somewhat silly but totally enjoyable fantasy film right when our real world seems to be utterly overwhelmed in events and circumstance far more scary that any that might flow form the Hotel Transylvania. Yes, it is a great escape and very much enjoyed. Odds are it won't win an Oscar, but take your kids to see Hotel Transylvania 2 and it will win their hearts and yours as well."
13,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,25 September 2015,Beyond My Imagination,"This movie is most appreciated. My favorite in the movie is the Count Dracula. There were so many creative things put in this. I honestly did not personally like the little boy myself, whereas the Count saw so much in him being his grandson, impressive. It was cute to see the girl with her dad. I don't recall seeing the 1st installment. The father was pretty cool but a little annoying. I guess no little pets in this one save for the hundreds or whatever of the little wolf creatures. I guess the little boy was cute in some ways, save for things like the bulbous red curly hair. He was a little mushy for even if he is a little boy. Anyway, most of what makes this movie what it is is the collective work of all the artists, especially also with the storyboard sequence humor, and the voice of Dracula."
14,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,25 September 2015,"Kids of all ages like this movie. You should go to ""Hotel Transylvania 2"".","Mixed marriages are tough. Couples in such situations have to join their disparate pasts into a life together that works for both of them. Their families and friends who are not used to being around the ""other kind"" may not know how to act in the couple's presence, even if everyone means well. Then there are all sorts of questions about how to raise their children. Should the kids be raised like the mother was raised or like the father? Should the family live closer to the father's family or the mother's? Should children be raised as alive or as the undead? Yup. Life can get pretty tricky when a human and a vampire marry. But watching these conflicts play out is a lot of fun in ""Hotel Transylvania 2"" (PG, 1:29).Returning for the sequel to 2012's animated hit ""Hotel Transylvania"" are director Genndy Tartakovsky, writer Rob Smigel (although gone is writing partner Peter Baynham, replaced for the sequel by Adam Sandler), and most of the voice cast from the original, with the action in the sequel picking up shortly after its predecessor's story ends. Dracula (Adam Sandler), the titular hotel's owner, is glowing like the full moon at the wedding of his vampire daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez) to her human love, Jonathan (Andy Samberg) and Drac's on Cloud 9 (or whichever cloud he was flying through) when he hears the news that Mavis is pregnant with his grandchild. Drac is convinced that the baby will be a vampire. It's impossible to tell whether the infant favors Mavis or Jonathan, but he seems like a fully human toddler.Drac grows increasingly anxious as Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) approaches his fifth birthday (when little vampires' fangs appear), and when Drac learns that Mavis is considering moving out of the hotel and going to live with the humans. Jonathan actually wants to continue living at Hotel Transylvania, where he has started to help out with hotel operations (now that the hotel is accepting human guests), but he reluctantly agrees to take Mavis to visit his parents (Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman) in California. Drac gets them to leave Dennis in his care while they're away. As soon as mom and dad are out of sight, he packs Dennis into his car seat while, Frank (Kevin James), Wayne (Steve Buscemi), Griffin (David Spade), Murray (Keegan-Michael Key) and Blobby (Jonny Solomon) pile in to help with Drac's mission.The vampire, Frankenstein's monster, the werewolf, the invisible man, the mummy and the blob have teamed up to help bring out Dennis' inner vampire-ness. The gang visits some of their old ""haunts"" to teach the kid the tricks of the monster trade, with some pretty funny results. Dennis is enjoying all of this, but Mavis is none too happy when she finds out what her father has been up to and she (literally) flies home to protect her son. As you'd probably guess, his little road trip doesn't exactly help Drac's chances of keeping Mavis, Jonathan and Dennis under his roof. Complicating the situation further is the attendance at Dennis' birthday party by his old-school human-hating great-grandpa Vlad (Mel Brooks).""Hotel Transylvania 2"" appeals to the eyes, the funny bone and the heart. The animation is so detailed that, at times, it almost felt like I was watching a live-action film  and I ""only"" saw it in 2-D! The script is clever, amusing, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. The voice actors are clearly having a good time, as was I, along with the kids and adults sitting around me if their laughter and smiles are any indication. The story's underlying lesson is the importance of accepting others (with your actions AND your attitudes), regardless of their differences. Mavis makes this point clearly when she admonishes Drac, saying, ""Maybe you've let humans into your hotel, dad, but I don't think you've let them into your heart."" Parts of this movie get a little dull, and some of the gags aren't as humorous as they're apparently meant to be, but most of the movie is fresh and fun. My advice is to head to the movies oh, and grab your kids to take them to ""Hotel Transylvania 2"". ""B+"""
15,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,29 May 2016,Pure Entertainment,"Mavis and Johnny get married to each other and are happily living in Hotel Transylvania. Soon Mavis is pregnant and gives birth to the boy Dennis. When he is five years old, his fangs have not grown and Mavis thinks to move to California with Johnny and Dennis to give a chance to the boy to be raised among humans. Dracula asks Johnny to travel with Mavis to the house of his parents in California and convinces her to stay at the hotel. Meanwhile Dracula joins his friends Frank, Wayne, Griffin, Murray and Blobby the Blob and they travel with Dennis to a vampire camp to teach the boy to turn into a vampire so that Mavis and Johnny stay at the hotel. However neither the boy transforms nor his fangs grew. Meanwhile Mavis is delighted with the facilities in supermarket in California and she is sure that moving to California would be the best for her son. What will be Mavis' final decision? ""Hotel Transylvania 2"" is pure entertainment for families, children and adults. The plot has many hilarious gags and most of the situations are very funny. Most of the characters are adorable and even the villain Vlad changes his behavior in the end. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Hotel Transilvânia 2"" (""Hotel Transylvania 2"")"
16,Hotel Transylvania 2,9,7 October 2015,Animation movie that stars Adam Sandler in a comedy that is fun for all ages.,"This movie is definitely very funny. Overall the plot isn't something that is a serious message and IF the audience accepts the fact that they are only going to be getting a funny movie out of Hotel Transylvania, then the experience will be much better. The evolution of Drac's beloved hotel is apparent in this movie. When his grandson enters the setting this changes the dynamic of the movie making it more interesting. The animation in this film is nonetheless, absolutely incredible. I have to hand it to the animation design crew, because in that regard, this movie was something special. The introduction was a little sped up, and the movie itself moves very fast so if you stop to take a pee break, there's a good chance you will definitely get lost in the movie. 9/10 from me.

17,Hotel Transylvania 2,4,4 January 2016,The Vidiot Reviews...,"Hotel Transylvania 2The key to dating Dracula's daughter is making sure to always wear a garlic-flavored condom.Unfortunately, the new dad in this animated movie didn't heed that warning.Unsure if his grandson Dennis will turn out to be a monster like his mother (Selena Gomez) or human like his father (Andy Samberg), Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) and his cronies (Steve Buscemi, Keegan-Michael Key, Kevin James, David Spade) take the tyke for the weekend.But when his father (Mel Brooks) shows up unexpectedly, Drac must keep Dennis' mixed bloodline a secret from the old orthodox bloodsucker.The unwarranted sequel to the mediocre original, HT2 does an inadequate job of establishing any time has past with the newfound parents still resembling teenagers.Furthermore, the jokes failed to have mature as well, making for a dismal revisit all-around.Incidentally, the issue of human/monster hybrid fetuses is going to flip the abortion issue on its ear.

18,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,4 October 2015,Absolutely hilarious!,"This is one of those movies that you watch and you just can't help but come out smiling afterwards about. It's so rib ticklingly funny and it really gets you feeling happy. It's seven years after first movie, Jonathan and Mavis get married, have a kid - little Dennis and gramps the Count Dracula wants him to be a half vampire. The Count tries all sorts of things to bring this side out. I will let you watch to see what happens. The characters are just fantastic, especially Count Dracula, Jonothan and Mavis. You also get a chance to see more of Murray's (mummy) , Griffin (invisible man), Frankenstein and Wayne's (werewolf) personalities in this movie. Love them and they really make you smile. Also funny is Blobby - a green jelly mould. He's so sweet don't know why he's scary but who cares. Loved Jonathan's in laws in this too! The human intake had a great side and the little boy Dennis plus girl werewolf Winnie was a brilliant cute factor. The vampire camp and tower scene is just without doubt brilliant to see. It's got a few scary moments with red eyes and teeth coming at the screen which may scare kids if they are jumpy but otherwise the music and look of the film is spectacular. Loved the flying together moment with Count and Mavis. Such a tender fun father daughter time. I just can't recommend this movie enough but go and see it - It's funny, touching, scary in parts and will leave you smiling for hours. Great for anyone whether young or old"
19,Hotel Transylvania 2,9,26 September 2015,"Loving, Forgiving and Just a Little Bit Crazy!","This animated movie directed by Genndy Tartakosky is truly hilarious and left the audience and me laughing out loud. If you didn't enjoy the original Hotel Transylvania very much, give this sequel another try because I truly believe this movie is much better than the original. By far my favorite character is Dracula (Adam Sandler), because he is such a special character. He is so loving, forgiving and maybe just a little crazy sometimes. This movie makes me want to have a grandfather like him because he is so powerful and loving. A continuous joke is Dracula trying to get used to his cell phone. His fingernails are too long to type with so he is always frustrated with this new technology.The relationship between Dracula and his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez) is so beautiful and memorable. With very exciting news, Mavis is pregnant! It's a boy! The strong bond between baby Dennis and his ""Vampa"" (vampire grandpa) Dracula, is my absolute favorite relationship through this whole movie because their love is so strong even though it is hard for Dracula to accept that his grandson is half human. Dracula is concerned that his grandson hasn't indicated that he is going to be a vampire, so he takes five of his hotel friends to try to scare the fangs out of Dennis. They go on this ridiculous adventure to do whatever it takes to get Dennis's fangs showing. Will Dennis be more like his mother who is a vampire, or stay a human like his father?Adam Sandler puts his own spin on this movie. As co-writer of the screenplay, his goofy short songs pop up throughout the movie. Not only are the song lyrics funny, but they are also relatable and entertaining for the audience because he takes commonly known songs such as twinkle twinkle and alters the words to be slightly inappropriate and silly. The special effects are outstanding and I enjoyed all of the different things they do with the animation. I watched this film in 3D and loved how it makes the characters and settings pop and makes each setting special. In the scene where Dracula leads Dennis and some other monster guests on a crazy adventure, there are so many special effects that it becomes total chaos. The message of this film is that no matter how different someone else is, they could be the best thing that ever happens to you, so love them no matter how different they are. This film really makes me realize how crucial to accept others.The character Blobby, a gelatinous blob, is definitely a crowd pleaser and the younger audiences laughed out loud at his silly antics. The target audience for Hotel Transylvania 2 is anyone who wants to laugh and have a good time. I recommend this movie for ages 5 to 18 because some of the scenes might be a little scary for some young children. I recommend seeing this movie in 3D as well because it is a very cool experience and give it 5 out of 5 stars because this movie is truly hilarious. Reviewed by Lainey A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
20,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,1 October 2015,"Holy Rabies! It's time to once again to check in, at Hotel Transylvania. I think you'll like your stay. Even if it's not as good as you remember it.","This sequel to the 2012 original film is indeed a monster mash, but it's not a graveyard smash for the most part. Still, the animation film is still watchable for a family friendly flick for the Halloween season. Once again, directed by fame animator, Genndy Tartakovsky, Hotel Transylvania 2 tells the story of Dracula (Voiced by Adam Sandler), who has since, been more open-minded with his relationship with human beings, since the last movie. While things are going great on the business side, Dracula is still worried about his family, mostly about his half-vampire, half-human grandson Dennis (Voiced by Asher Blinkoff), because he isn't showing any signs of being a vampire. Since, Dennis hasn't show any signs to be immortal, Dracula's adult daughter, Mavis (Voiced by Selena Gomez) believes that the castle might not to be the best place to raise a human child, so she wants to visits her in-laws place in California with her husband Jonathan (Voiced by Andy Sanberg) to see if that's a good place to relocate. Fearing he'll lose his daughter and grandson, forever, Dracula must tries to push Dennis to his limits, in hope to get his inner monster, out, so Mavis will change her mind. Will Dracula be successful with his attempts or will Dracula have to learn to adapt, that his daughter is all grown up and ready to leave the nest? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie was somewhat disappointing. Yes, it clearly have some positive messages about family unity, tolerance and diversity that children could learn from; but sadly, this animated comedy also lacks the emotional heart, social commentary and funny humor, that really shine in the first movie. The whole deus ex machina ending with Dracula's own father, Vlad (Voiced by Mel Brooks) was very anticlimax and really comes out of nowhere. Mel Brooks was so misused in this. I wish, he had more screen time, than he got. Honestly, the lack of screen time, kinda hurts his bad guy turn good guy role. It wasn't believable, when he does it. How does a prejudiced vampire father, who isn't tolerant of humans, changes his views, he's had of humans for hundreds if not thousands of years in roughly two minutes, because his great-grandson is half-human. Come on, movie! The whole diversity issue between monsters & humans from the first movie was somewhat, the best thing about the first film. I felt that it was really lacking here. I was really hoping, more 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, type of smart humor with Vlad. Honestly, Hotel Transylvania 2 would be, a stronger movie, if it didn't cop out; because it can somewhat relatable to real-life parents. Indeed, one day, your adult children might move out, and make a life of their own. You just have to learn, how to deal with it. It would have been, a very good message for both young & older parents as well as their children. While, the single Tex Avery-influenced animated motion is beautifully well-made & will surely amuse the younger children. Having that message would make this film, so much better. It would had brought back the emotional impact that I love from the first film, between Dracula & Mavis. Another problem about the film, is the lack of the Hotel settling. Yes, most of it, is still placed in Transylvania, but for a film call Hotel Transylvania 2, it really has nothing to do with the hotel, this time. I would love, if the movie add a sub-plot of Dracula trying to have Mavis, be his heir to the family business and forcing her to choose between turning Jonathan & Dennis into immortal vampires by biting them, or to leave them as mortal humans. It would make a more-well-rounded in-depth film. Regards of what ifs, the movie as a whole was entertaining. Some of the humor was funny, but most of it, was meh. I really, could do, without those clean-cut 'Family Guy' style, humorous cut scenes & outlandish pop culture songs interrupts. They really fall flat. Adam Sandler once again, works great as Dracula. You can tell, that he really loves, playing this role. After all, Sandler signed up, for the original film, just to make a movie that, he and his daughter, Sadie can watch, together. You really can tell that Sandler cut down on his man-child toilet-base shtick, just to make this kid-targeted humor film, work. For the most part, it kinda does. Once again, Sandler's film buddies: Kevin James, Steve Buscemi & David Spade, are able to find work, because of his influence in production. The only different, this time, is that Keegan-Michael Key, replacing CeeLo Green as Murray the Mummy, due to previous actor/singer Ceelo Green being arrested, during film production in 2014. In my opinion, Keegan-Michael Key is a lot funnier than CeeLo Green, ever was, in this role. For the rest of the roles, Selena Gomez and Andy Sanberg are still wonderful. I do love their funny sub-story adventure in California. To the film credit, Hotel Transylvania 2 does takes the characters in some new and interesting directions, that I didn't see coming. I do like the odd, sly nods and allusions to old horror movies, with a slight mixer with 21 century technology humor and social media references. While, the necrophilia overtones can be somewhat gross & jarring when thinking too deep about it. The only thing, I really hated about the film, is how it kinda insults 1931's Dracula, by naming the bad guy in the film, Bela. That was really offensive to the fan-based. Overall: While, Hotel Transylvania 2, doesn't reach the same heights as its predecessor, it still somewhat top-notch. A great Halloween treat, worth trick or treating."
21,Hotel Transylvania 2,1,21 December 2015,Very annoying,"The scenario of this animation could be written on the back of a beer mat,so what do you do when you have almost no story to tell ? Quite simple, action films in the same situation tend to add a lot of special effects, but that does not really apply to animation so you just overload the film by speeding up the animations expecting that the result will be funny. Unfortunately fast animation is not synonymous with gags and in this film the gags are lame and repetitive, for instance how many times have we got to see the blob character to absorb somebody ? The first time you may smile but as it is repeated at least three times it looks like they are just filling up. They have a go at jokes when for instance a monster sniffs the mother of - I think Johnny - the monster says ""you smell funny"" the mother replies ""It is called DEODORANT"" and she adds ""He must be European"" the joke being Europeans don't wash and smell bad. It is just insulting and not funny, this is just a crass attempt at a joke.So this film is a nice but empty and not funny animation.Avoid."
22,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,6 October 2015,Hotel Transylvania 2 revision and opinions,"A sequel to Hotel Transylvania, Hotel Transylvania 2 begins with a slow zoom-in on the castle itself. Everything is being thrown around and put together for Jonathan (human) and Mavis's (vampire) wedding. All that matters to Dracula is that his daughter is happy at the hotel that use to only allow monsters to stay, until Jonathan found it in the first movie. Time passes and great news about a baby in the Dracula family is to be born by Mavis. Excited and motivated, Dracula is determined to see Dennis, the baby boy, become a great vampire and carry the legacy of Dracula. The main problem was Dennis didn't have fangs when he was born and he had until five years old to grow them in so he could stay at Hotel Transylvania, because Mavis wanted a human to get human interaction. She thought it wasn't safe with all the monsters around. The story itself is amusing and fun for kids who are into the social world and know the traditional stories of monsters such as: Frankenstein, Dracula, Werewolf, Invisible Man, Mummy and other monsters. An example of the social world being incorporated into the monster world was the desk clerk monsters for the hotel were playing with a picture app on a phone that allows you to disfigure your face or body. Jonathan was innovating the hotel by getting monsters connected through computers and phones since they were now allowing humans to stay at the hotel. There were instances where humans were interacting with the monsters with no problem. For instance, Dracula was taking Dennis out so he could scare the fangs into him at Dark Forest Municipal Park, a place crawling with humans just walking, jogging, or with their pets. Frankenstein tried to scare two girls that were jogging and they flipped out, because it was the popular Frankenstein and they wanted a picture with him. Four-year-old Dennis jumped out right after and said ""boo,"" but only got a pat on the head instead of frightening girls. Dracula was also asked by a man driving a car where him and the girl in the passenger seat could get a ""bite"" to eat, not thinking that it was a blood drinking vampire. Werewolf, or Wayne, was directed to kill something in the forest for food but didn't want to because there were pop tarts now. I'm a fan of animated films and comedy, which the film did well in both. A lot of the scenes incorporated humans and monsters and showed how the dialogue between both was funny. For example, Dracula's new phone given by Jonathan has a GPS with a deep vampire voice. A scene also showed how great Invisible man was at teaching his workout class. The sleeping lullaby that was sung by Dracula was ""suffer, suffer, scream and shout,"" showed an example of the difference in a human lullaby and Dracula's. A lot of cool effects were part of the movie as well since there were monsters. For instance, Dracula could change into a bat and have powers to freeze people or change objects. Another cool effect was showing the pack of werewolves, made by Wayne and his wife Wanda, become a wave that swept through the birthday party decorations and shaving anyone in their way from hip down. Also, Dracula's dad coming to Dennis's fifth birthday party showed nice effects by changing the human in a monster suit to a scary monster with sharp teeth and muscles popping onto the body to scare the fangs out of Dennis.However, everyone's attempt to scare the fangs into Dennis did not work. Dracula's dad's vampire minion hurting Winnie, werewolf girl that Dennis liked, made Dennis's fangs come out. It was followed by a fight between the Hotel Transylvania family and the bundle of vampire minions being crushed. In this fight alone, you get to witness Dennis showing his strength, his bat flying skills, and his ability to freeze people. In the end, scaring the fangs out of Dennis didn't work. Instead, Dennis's want to protect Winnie brought out his fangs. Dracula was so obsessed with Dennis becoming a vampire that he almost forgot he didn't care if Dennis was going to be a human, a vampire, or a unicorn. Regardless of what Dennis became, Dracula would adore and love his grandchild. The grandpa vampire, Vlad, was originally a vampire conservative type of guy but ended up changing his ways and stopping his vampire minion from killing Jonathan. The movie ended in a great way by connecting all the family members together, Jonathan's human family and Dracula's monster family.The only thing I think the movie could improve on was the jumping back and forth of scenes. When Mavis went with Jonathan to visit his family in Santa Cruz, California, it seemed like their stay was brief and the scenes lasted longer than it should have since the focus was on Dennis getting his fangs. I can see why they were sent off though, because it was part of the plan to get the protective mom, Mavis, away so the scaring could happen. Overall the incorporation of humans and monsters comfortably in each scene was great and made the movie enjoyable and family friendly. Some of the animated character's voices were played by Adam Sandler (Dracula), Andy Samberg (Jonathan), Mavis (Selena Gomez), Frankenstein (Kevin James), Werewolf Wayne (Steve Buscemi), Invisible Man Griffin (David Spade), and Mummy Murray (Keegan- Michael Key). The director of Hotel Transylvania 2 is Genndy Tartakovsky and writing credit were given to Adam Sandler and Robert Smigel. I can see why the comedy came so easily since Adam Sandler was in it, and he had some characters who are in a lot of his other movies as well such as Grown Ups and Just Go with It (""Biography,"" IMDb.com). Since the movie was animated, the monsters and their facial expressions made the jokes come to life."
23,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,11 October 2015,Hotel Transylvania 2 (some spoiler ahead),"Today myself,mom and my younger brother were lucky to have seen the preview of this movie before its worldwide release on Friday 16th of October. Hotel Transylvania 2 is the sequel and follow up to the 2012 film of the same name where Dracula this time has made his hotel a welcoming place for humans to stay at. This time around and Mavis and Johnny(voiced by Selena Gomez from Wizards Of Waverly Place and Andy Samberg from That's My Boy)are now married and have a son called Dennis. But Dracula(voiced by Adam Sandler)is happy that Dennis is a human and doesn't care who he is as long as Mavis and Johnny have a healthy boy. Meanwhile Mavis and Johnny take a trip to California for a few days without Dennis and of course this causes some problems along the way as Dracula and his crew are desperate to make Dennis a vampire. So is Dennis a vampire waiting to get his fangs or is he a normal little boy like his father Johnny?Good: The animation in this is just as good as the original film its dark and slightly colourful at the same time. The humor is very good as well as the voice acting and Adam Sandler for me is better at doing voice over work now than his live action films which are how shall I put it boring and crap. So if I were Sandler i'd stick to animation for now on. As for the rest they are all good too. Also I like how the guy that voices the mummy sounds exactly like Cee-Lo Green(as he wasn't available to do the sequel). The music is good as Fifth Harmony's Worth It and the title song I'm In Love With A Monster are great songs but I do prefer Becky G's Monster remix a bit better though to be honest with ya.Bad: Is it me or does this movie feel like a parody of Twilight human falling for a vampire,human has a child who maybe a vampire or not etc. But still though this was very funny and I was glad to have seen this film today.7/10Very good for the kiddies and for those who are die-had fans of horror films(I don't like horror films but surprise surprise I liked this one.Also legendary voice over actor Mel Brooks is in this as Dracula's dad Vlad and of course Dana Carvey from that god awful film Master Of Disguise makes a cameo as Dana the co-coordinator for the vampire camp."
24,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,3 October 2015,Drac's pack is back! (And it's bigger),"When I first heard about Hotel Transylvania 2, I was so exited for this movie, since the first one was a blast.Well it's good, very good (but not exactly)...The film saw us a huge ""evolution"" of Drac's beloved hotel. Now accepting humans, use gadgets and so on. Than his grandson came, The adorable Dennis. With Mavis and Jhonny went to where Jhonny grew up, Drac tries to make Dennis grow his fangs.And that's where the chaos beginThe whole film was very entertaining. Adam Sandler's performance as Dracula is so entertaining, plus he make most of the jokes extremely funny. Than there's his friends: A Frankenstein, a invincible man, a mummy, a werewolf(?) and the laugh maker blob. All of his friends make a fantastic combination of absolute laughter. Plus Dennis relationship with other monsters is adorable and heartwarmingNow i want to talk some bad things: The film couldn't make a more interesting plot. I always wondering why it starts with Drac's fathers visit, A fight between a group of evil vampires, they won and it's done. It's plot is to short and so simple. The film is also quite short. for about 86 minutes, it seems the film doesn't like long stories, it's to short for me.Overall, the film gives a great combination of friendship, cheerful tone, and a great pack of laughter. Looks like the Drac pack they promise were not a disappointmentFINAL SCORE: 7/10"
25,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,14 October 2015,Wow! One of best animated movies of 2015,"Seriously, Hotel Transylvania 2 is outstanding movie. Hotel Transylvania first part was also magnificent and full of funny dose. This movie is full of funny scenes, jokes, dialogue and characters. Directors and animators have done very excellent work to make this film one of the best animated movies of Hollywood! I loved Hotel Transylvania 1 and now its second part is also outstanding as first part. I don't understand why people are giving it negative votes, this movie deserves more than 8 rating of course. Hotel Transylvania 2 is a very good comedy and very enjoyable movie. I suggest you to watch this movie now as it is amazing as it's first part."
26,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,29 September 2015,It's a winner for Adam Sandler!,"When you have Genndy Tartakovsky who created Samurai Jack as the director and Robert Smigel who created the The Ambiguously Gay Duo as one of the writers, it's going to be nothing less than stellar.Looks like Adam Sandler has found his animated franchise following up the decent Hotel Transylvania with a sequel that was funnier that the first. He's not gonna top his fellow Saturday Night Live Alums, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy who hold it down with Shrek, but it's a good hardy laugh.In the sequel, Dracula has more daughter issues when Mavis and her human husband want to movie to sunny California and raise their son Dennis normal. Drac's only hope is if his grandson shows signs of being more monster than human, and with the help of his monster gang he tries to influence the outcome.Though the voice cast was an impressive who's who even in the small parts. Nothing topped Mel Brooks performance as Vlad, Drac's dad, that was my favorite.It's a perfect family picture which means anyone, any age will enjoy it."
27,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,18 October 2015,Dractastic!!!,I have to tell you guys honestly I was really nervous about seeing this movie because it is a sequel and not too many sequels do too good but some do good and this one actually surprised me and did really good because I took my brother and my dad to see it and we laughed a lot in the movie and there was some twists that you and I expect so it is a really funny movie to watch and it's a lot better than the original hotel Transylvania movie plus it had a lot of guest stars in it. I highly recommend that you get Hotel Transylvania two on DVD it has a lot of Halloween we were a lot of monsters to her it would be very funny to watch with your kids on Halloween so it is just very very funny it's just it!!!
28,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,29 September 2015,DHKR: Hotel Transylvania 2,"Short version: if you enjoyed the first one, you'll enjoy this one just as much, if not more so.Long version: Since you asked nicelyI had virtually no opinion on the original Hotel Transylvania. For what it was, it was a cute little movie about monsters that kids could enjoy and adults could at least tolerate. Nothing about it really grinded my gears, nor did it make me see the light of non-Pixar-Dreamworks animated films. It was just a cute movie, through and through. However, when the trailers for the sequel came out, I felt like this one would go the same route as most animated sequels, and the modern tech jargon didn't raise any expectations either. However, after watching the film in its entirety, I was quite surprised that movie not only stood on its own quite well as a fun, cartoonish adventure in the world of monsters, but actually managed to be better then the first one, despite being a rehash.Being a rehash isn't always a bad thing, any fan of Marvel should keep that as creed now a days. Sometimes, a retelling is all you need to make a tolerable sequel. Sure, there is that sort of pillow of comfort of not being any different, but it can explore many different possibilities in the world without the need of lengthy world building. The original Hotel Transylvania had us restrained into, well, Hotel Transylvania. We might've seen one scene near the end where we got to see an airport near Budapest. In HT2, we see more, if only a little bit, for more time. And what we see is affected by the first movie, boasting a little bit of continuity.It's not all just for the adults though. Kids will love the energetic, cartoonish movements of each of the monsters. In one of the biggest strengths the film has, the animation is of pretty good quality and fluid in motion, not to mention creatively designed. These monsters are a blend of that classic style, with a bit of Tiny Toons mixed up, with voice work to match(yes, even the usually annoying child voice of Adam Sandler.). For the fault of its cast, I can at least see that effort was put in, which the earlier Sandler film ""Pixels"" had an unfortunate lack of.If I have any real gripes, it's with the story. As well executed as it is, along with sprinkling a pretty good message, it's still just a rehash of the first movie. Basically, the first movie had Dracula try to keep his daughter from falling in love so she wouldn't leave the hotel, and a message about letting go is implemented. Here, in the sequel, Dracula is trying to awaken his grandson's inner monster...so his daughter won't leave the hotel. Oh, and Mel Brooks is some kind of elder vampire here who has a horde of terrifying looking bat monsters. It's not as cool as it sounds, but it makes one hell of a final act.If you have young kids, or if you were just a fan of the first movie, chances are you will enjoy this for what it is and more so. It's a surprisingly good early Halloween film that's a good time for kids and adults. See it, and probably won't be disappointed."
29,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,30 September 2015,Hotel Transylvania 2 is a good enough sequel to its predecessor,"Before reviewing this sequel to Hotel Transylvania, I looked up my comments on the previous one in which I gave that one an 8. This one was quite funny as well and once again, explores the possible prejudices of the Adam Sandler father vampire character concerning his grandson and the question if he has the same genes. There's also the added voice of Mel Brooks as the great-granddad of the boy he had yet to see and the explanation is provided of why he hadn't seen him or his son for years. Genndy Tartakovsky is once again the director and he provides enough visual humor to keep one entertained. I also liked the relationship between that boy and a girl wolf who likes him. In summary, Hotel Transylvania 2 has enough to keep one entertained."
30,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,25 September 2015,Hotel Transylvania 2 Review,"Now Dracula's (Adam Sandler) Hotel Transylvania is open to humans, things for him are changing for the better. Not everything is going right for him since Dracula is worried that his half-human grandson Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) hasn't yet shown his vampire side. To help with this, Dracula asks his monster friends The Invisible Man (David Spade), The Mummy (Keegan-Michael Key), The Werewolf (Steve Buscemi), and Frankenstein (Kevin James) to help him train Dennis to be a monster while Mavis and Johnny (Selena Gomez and Andy Samberg) are away on vacation. Things for them then get more complicated when Dracula's old-school father Vlad (Mel Brooks) pays an unexpected visit.I am an adult but I'm not afraid to admit that I like to watch animated kids films. Maybe it's because they remind me of my childhood. To me the things that make a good animated film are it sounds it simple but good animation and a good story, not a stupid story that just doesn't make sense. I hate stories that don't make sense because it just makes me feel bad for kids who keep fooling for it. Suffice it to say, this one has both. Like the first film, the animation isn't groundbreaking but I thought it looked good on the theater screen. I saw it in 3D which it gave it some nice touches bringing the monsters and the intricacies of the castle to life but I think it would be just as good without it. I thought the story was better than the first film as it focused more on the family aspect than the hotel itself. The film was more about the Dracula and Mavis relationship which I thought was the secondary focus of the first film. I liked this direction better as I greatly enjoyed the scenes between Dracula, Dennis, and all the other monsters. There are just as many, or maybe more funny moments and one-liners than the first film. There are still funny moments involving the other monsters in the hotel but those are toned down from the first film. The jokes were a little less stupid than the first film but I still found them funny for the most part. I think (and possibly others) that if the film was just more of the same, it would have been quite boring. I didn't think it was. Just like the first film, I thought the voice work was good all around and Dracula was still my favorite character. I also thought he sounded less like an Adam Sandler character than he did in the first film. I thought the film's message wasn't as good as the first but it was still good. When compared to top animated films, this one does not come close but it is still a cute film and an enjoyable experience for both kids and adults alike.Score: 7.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com"
31,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,25 September 2015,Rewarding Craziness,"2012's Hotel Transylvania was kind of a surprise. Though it's still riddled with pop cultural references, but its flavor wondrously resembles to the director's cartoon shows in the 90's which brings visual and comedic nostalgia, in the CG animated form (or it's basically just acknowledging us that this type of animation still exists.) Revisiting the same gang with the same people behind it can be welcoming, maybe a little worrisome when it comes to plotting. The prediction can be somewhat true; the craziness and heart remains, but the narrative is too busy, even without much development, even compared to its predecessor. What exceeds the expectation is the theme it handles is a lot interesting. Overall, it brought enough nuttiness for the fans and brought enough sweetness to everyone else.While the first one was about overcoming the monster's misanthropy, Hotel Transylvania 2 is about trying to accept humans, even though Drac haven't fully let go of his old nature. And the setup starts from Dracula's daughter, Mavis, marrying a human, Jonathan, then transitioned to them having a baby. And the main conflict here is their son not inheriting the vampire gene may lead the couple to live in a normal human town. And just like what the trailer shows, the movie mostly runs with Dracula pushing his grandson to become a vampire, assuming that he may just be a late bloomer. And these scenes don't exactly make a clever narrative, they are basically just one gag to another, while we occasionally see the kid's parents trying to fit in the human world. In spite of still being entertaining and funny, the plot doesn't seem to actually move forward. It's like it's just playing around until it decides to proceed or something. But at times, it's sort of hinting something more heartfelt; like how Mavis feels like she is being somewhat patronized in the human world or how young Dennis is getting tired with Dracula's demands. And it's surprisingly more engaging to watch, even though the gags are already pretty fun.It doesn't go deep, obviously, but it makes up a lot after an almost extravagant extent of punchlines. The animation is still crazy looking which brings distinct appeal within their unhinged facial expressions, energetic movements and freely constructed action. Even for jokes where the punchline is just being awkward (for no particular reason,) it sort of perfectly fits with this type of visual. The humor is best when it is spoken by the animation. The voice acting is still delightful, with Adam Sandler still bringing the heart in Dracula. The rest just gave these already lively animated characters more personalities.Hotel Transylvania 2 is pretty entertaining, despite of not handling any subtle narrative, though I don't think many would be asking for that, but I may be a good suggestion. Maybe the only main disappointment is it's probably not as outrageous as its predecessor. I mean it's not totally restrained, of course, you would definitely still find a lot of crazy animation and wonderfully absurd facial expressions here, but maybe not as insane as the first movie did. I don't know, maybe it's just my expectations of witnessing more images to delightfully laugh at like the scene where Jonny was trying to scare a rat. And even the verbal humor where they were playing charades with the Invisible Man. But again, it's just my expectations. It's still pretty funny. The only worst thing you may find here are the blatant Sony products and I don't exactly know how you can shrug that off. Anyway, the movie still carries a much better message in the end, about being treated fairly, no matter how different you are to others. It shows it well and it seems pretty sincere. If you're not into this type of absurd animation, then at least its final note could make everything up to your viewing."
32,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,26 September 2015,A Rehashing of the First Tale that Is Still Fun,"It's the end of September, and once more a beginning of pumpkin spice lattes, football season, and the transitional movie season as we approach the holidays. This weekend, another animated ""blockbuster"" drops its fangs and sinks itself into the waiting juvenile masses. This vivid description is to serve as an opening for my latest review assignment on Hotel Transylvania 2. While Halloween is still a few weeks off, Adam Sandler and his buddies release their animated sequel in hopes of kicking off October right. Can this franchise keep the same ""spirit"" of fun and humorous, or does it join the list of unimpressive sequels. Read on to find out. The first Hotel Transylvania was cute and family friendly, qualities that number two amplifies to the next level with Dracula's grandson. Dennis is an adorable, big eyed, high- pitched toddler whose innocence leads our ""heroes"" to teach him the old monster ways. The kid himself is cute, This journey is very simplistic, filled with half baked schemes, overused taglines, and some running gags that while funny do eventually get stale at some point (a.k.a the blah blah blah thing). Sandler's team uses their usual bag of tricks to spur up some laughs, many of the ploys entertaining the wave of kids in my showing. However, Sandler's wit seems to come out a little more in the hotel, as his writers poke fun at a number of modern day ""conveniences"" that are more relevant to the audience. Cell phones, social media, even the modern day television icons (i.e. cakey the monster) all are mocked by the lord of darkness at how ridiculous (and overused) these things are. So the humor and cuteness is the same, but what about the story? Much like the humor, the tale of this film has much of the same feeling as its predecessor. Despite the events of the first movie, Dracula still has issues with the whole monster/human racial thing in the movie. The team must have run out of ideas, because a lot of scenes may seem familiar from the first film, especially in terms of Dracula's obsession with keeping Mavis. Yet amidst of the sea of familiarity, the more ""unique"" elements maintain their charm and fit well with rehashed storyline. That is until you get to the grand finale. To me the whole ending sequence was a rushed wrap up that although brought some action, lacked the finesse the movie had. It almost seemed like it was designed to bring a barely mentioned character into the picture, which wasn't necessary. Animation wise the film lives up to the standards the first one set. Drac and the crew fluidly move about the scenes, the voices match the lips, with the exception of the invisible man whose glass just teeter, and visuals are fun and colorful. The lack of new features is a little disappointing, but it was to be expected when you limit yourself to a hotel and pull out all the stops on the first movie. Of course many of your little ones won't care as long as they get to see Drac and the crew do their ridiculous stunts. In terms of voice acting, again nothing new here. Sandler's Transylvanian accent still makes me giggle, and his throaty, over exaggerated cries are still consistent over the last two decades. Gomez has managed to bring back Mavis' modern woman charm, while also adding the emotional touch of an overprotective mother. Kevin James is well Kevin James, a mixture of loud screaming and hushed talking that pales in comparison to how the monster looks. The problem with this movie is that the other characters really don't get much voice time in this picture. Buschemi, Spade, even Samberg felt pushed on the backburner, with Sandler taking most of the dialog in this movie. Not only did this limit the character interactions we enjoyed, but also deprived us of some more diverse comedy. On the plus side, it meant limited time hearing Fran Drescher's voice.Hotel Transylvania 2 has the same fun, family friendly element that charmed many audience members long ago. Not much has changed over the past few years, which isn't a bad thing in a movie like this. However, I would have liked to see a more cohesive and in depth story like the first one to round up the picture. Nevertheless, the younger members will scream in delight with this film, while the older crowd will enjoy the more subtle pokes at popular media. Worth a trip to theater? I'll say yes, just because of the fun adventure, but there really isn't anything ""theater worthy"" of it. My scores are:Animation/Comedy/Family: 8 Movie Overall: 7"
33,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,28 September 2015,Another funny monstrous misadventure,"Mavis(Selena Gomez) and Jonathan(Andy Samberg) finally get married in Hotel Transylvania, after almost a year Mavis learns that she is pregnant. After Mavis gives birth, she and Jonathan try to decide where to live. But Dracula(Adam Sandler) wants them to live at the Hotel, so he and his monster friends try to help the grandkid discover his vampire powers, but the question is, will they? The funny monsters return, it's about has funny has the first one, everybody does there voices well. I can't help but feel that this could be a good prime time comedy, a funny monster animated series could work, anybody remember The Munsters(1966-1968). A good animated film for kids and adults."
34,Hotel Transylvania 2,2,10 March 2016,The sequel does not live up to the original.,I really enjoyed the first film and was so looking forward to this one.But I have to say it's terrible. There is not one funny moment in it. It's filled with every bad cliché in the book. It's filled with tired flat jokes and as a result it's terminally unfunny from start to finish. Such a shame as the original was such fun. Glad I didn't out to go and see it in the cinema as I would have been really annoyed at the waste of good money.Not even Mel Brooks could save this film. Very disappointing.
35,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,26 October 2015,Bleh bleh bleh ... i don't say bleh bleh bleh!,"this movie is hilarious and entertaining . First off this movie imo is more entertaining then then its predecessor .Adam Sandler did a fantastic Dracula voice , seriously the voice cast for this movie was awesome and the fact of the matter is they do a really good job at portraying a good message while keeping you entertained ( unlike inside out) which was depressing afThe character design is superb as well , i love how they made the character design of mavis from selena gomez (shes gorgeous ) .This is the type of movie adults and kids can enjoy together and share a good laugh . and also it deserves to win academy award for best animation of the year since it was the best compared to the other animated movies in 2015 ."
36,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,23 October 2015,Good family fun,"Dracula, daughter Mavis, and non-vampire son-in-law Jonathan are happily managing the hotel full of monsters, as per the end of the original movie. When grandson Dennis is born, Dracula cannot wait for him to manifest his vampiric heritage, but Dennis seems as if he will always be a curly ginger-haired human. Following Mavis saying that she is thinking of moving away from the hotel, Dracula sends her and Jonathan to have a holiday with Jonathan's parents, while he spends time with Dennis, going on a camping trip with him. Chaos ensues.This film strikes me as only existing because its predecessor was so popular  it has a tolerable but entirely predictable story, and is the sort of movie where, if you enjoyed the first one then you'll enjoy this and, if you didn't, you won't. But that is an observation, not a criticism, because this film is pretty funny, albeit often taken at such breakneck speed that the gag has gone before you realised there was a gag there in the first place. The story voice cast do well, and this is a highly enjoyable family film with some heart (albeit the same heart the first film had)."
37,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,25 October 2015,Fun and enjoyable is the sequel to the animated hit.,"The sequel to the hit animated comedy proves it worth the loved it gets as it showcases raw emotion, fun and pop culture all wrap into one.Few sequels in modern film could be better than the first, and Hotel Transylvania 2 is one of those. As it expands instead of developing a new idea that make the this film feel like an adventure with many funny and charming moments. in addition, the story of it replicates modern day civilization as it shows the different points of view from the old and young people. Overall, Hotel Transylvania 2 will delight Kids and adults alike and will please fans at the same time will covert many non fans."
38,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,28 September 2015,Not a bad way to pass an hour,"The original Hotel Transylvania proved a neat little surprise for Sony. Having been stuck in development since 2002, the movie went on to gross 358 million dollars worldwide out of a relatively small budget (for an animated film) of 85 million. So here we are 3 years later and Hotel Transylvania 2 has arrived with the same director and (mostly) the same cast. Now we all know that sequels are a tough nut to crack, the animation genre is filled with unnecessary and bland sequels (Rio 2, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, Cars 2, everything after Shrek 2). But if done right, sequels to animated movies, and sequels in general, can stand on their own as being as good as the original or superior to them (The Toy Story sequels, How to Train Your Dragon 2). Hotel Transylvania 2 is not the latter.The story this time around is that Jonathan and Mavis, the lovers from the first film, are now married and have their own child, named Dennis. Mavis is worried about her son's safety so she and Jonathan venture off to California to look for a new place to raise their boy in. They leave Dennis with Dracula while they leave which, of course, is a bad idea. From there on the story revolves mostly around Dracula and pals trying to bring out the inner monster in Dennis since Dracula sees him being a regular human as a bit of a letdown. So what did I like about this movie? Well the animation is the same as in the last one, that is to say gorgeous but it does look bland in a few places. And the voice cast does pretty well as their characters. There's a joke or gag every minute so that'll definitely keep kids entertained (and maybe bring out a chuckle or two from adults) and surprisingly, there's no fart jokes at all!So the movie does offer a fun time but a gripe I have with the movie is how frantic it is. Characters in the film are constantly one upping themselves in terms of how unbelievably ridiculous they can be to the point where I could barely keep up with what was going on in the frame. I'm sure it's to keep the kids in their seats and interested in the movie but it just felt like too much.My second biggest problem with the film is how forced the third act is. So up until like 3/4ths of the way into the movie I realized that there was no actual antagonist. This isn't a problem of course, films like Inside Out have shown that you don't need villains in animated films. Then the third act rolls around and we finally get an antagonist. He's some sort of bat creature who (SPOILER ALERT) has some sort of thing going on with Dracula's dad, Vlad.Now let me clarify on something here, the advertisements for this movie have made a big point of showing that Dracula's dad is in this movie. The truth is he's in this movie for like 10 minutes tops and does nothing really. He rolls in around the last 30 minutes of the movie.So anyways it's never clarified what the antagonist's relationship is with Vlad. Is he his brother? Cousin? Roommate? It's never mentioned! So he shows up in the last 30 minutes and begins his evil-doing for about 5 minutes. However he doesn't work in the movie because he's not given a set up or does anything that's antagonist worthy. We're given only the vaguest of ideas as to what his evil plan is, if he even had one. And to add into the overall disjointed final act the movie ends with a battle against bat minions that looks like the ending of a Marvel movie. It makes no sense tonally when compared to the rest of the movie.But my biggest problem with this movie is something that plagues a lot of movies today but it particularly troubled me in this movie and that isthe product placement.Every single character in this movie uses a Sony product. Even the monsters! A subplot of this movie is Dracula's inability to use a cellphone and I'd say that about 5 minutes of the movie is devoted to characters using products that prominently feature the Sony logo. This is not acceptable in an animated movie about monsters, if I remember correctly Monsters University didn't have product placement. It's so out of place here that it took me out of the movie.Something else here that troubles me is the missed story opportunities here. So due to the ending of the original Hotel Transylvania, monsters are now accepted everywhere. That boggled my mind, monsters are showing being married to regular human beings and being accepted by the rest of the planet with no mention as to how governments are reacting to this or if people are freaked out.Now I know this might be too much for a kid's movie but wouldn't it have been a lot more interesting of a movie if it was about how the rest of the world reacts to the sudden knowledge that MONSTERS HAVE BEEN LIVING AMONG THEM THE ENTIRE TEAM? So overall Hotel Transylvania 2 is not as good as the original. While the original had a neat story and clever ideas this one seems to be more like a second thought. It's just entertainment for your kids, none of Pixar's adult storytelling is here and that's okay if you're just looking to pass an hour.I'm going to give Hotel Transylvania 2 a C-"
39,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,5 October 2015,The Bride Wore Black (including her lipstick & nails) . . .,". . . in the year's biggest Nerd\Goth social event. ""Vampire, human, unicorn--you're perfect no matter what"" is the primary take-away lesson from HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 2. In this cartoon world, monsters' traditional heartless sadism has been turned inward as self-obsessive masochism, evidenced by their lyrics to the ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" lullaby. If further proof is required of their self-flagellation, picture this: Someone guzzling 80 large Slurpees in 20 minutes. If that doesn't produce enough brain freeze to numb one's neuroses, nothing will. Dracula's daughter, Mavis, seriously ponders defecting to Santa Cruz, CA (mostly because she mistakes it for the stomping grounds of Santa Claws, Transylvanians' second favorite American monster (after the Rifleman). It may take years for Hollywood to have the technology updates necessary to do a live-action remake of this story (especially the tiny Dennisovitch bat with the curly red hair). Globby remains Transylvania's scariest fiend (after Diabetes, of course)."
40,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,5 December 2015,Another story from Hotel Transylvania,"Well, i do have high hopes in this film since i pretty much like the first one. Sadly, it did not meet my expectation. You see, the the trailer was good. You can see all the fun part in the movies and it made you wonder about Dennis, the new character in the movie. It did make me couldn't wait to see this movie. However, it turned out to be a quite ordinary movie without any element of surprise ( the trailer, maybe already told us 80% of the story )Basically, this movie told us the continuation of Hotel Transylvania where Mavies and Jonathan finally got married and had a kid, named Dennis. The kid, looks totally normal just like another mortal kid. The Drac, Dennis grandpa, want to prove ( or should i say, have a high expectation ) that his grandson is also a vampire not just a normal human. The ending itself, was quite disappointing. I thought like "" what? so, that's all? just like that? so, what's the moral of this story?"". The ending doesn't give quite impact and so the story feels flat.It was a fine movie for family, but not the kind of movie that i will highly recommended to watch. The first one is much more better ( and funnier ) than this one."
41,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,24 September 2015,"A typical comedy spectacle, but with surprisingly endearing and witty moments Hotel Transylvania 2 is better than the original and a decent watch for family.","With Disney and Pixar reigning over animation genre, it's hard for other studios to compete against their emotionally engaging tales. Hotel Transylvania 2, while not particularly incredible, is unexpectedly funny and enjoyable. The large cast of fumbling monstrosities and the nocturnal vampire household deliver enough charming wit for a few simple warm laughs.Story follows Drac and friends as they welcome the newest member of the half-man half-vampire family. The boy is clearly a cuddly bait for empathy, in fact many of its adorable gimmicks are built to relate to casual audience. This admittedly might feel cheesy at times since the movie opens up with overly comical tone.However, once it hits the midway point, it warms up pretty well. The odd union between man and vamp is strangely relatable. Mavis is a good character, she's youthful, full of curiosity and also naturally protective of her son. It makes a good contrast against Johnny's family, which is a cynical take on suburban parents. The couple compromises on different often trivial things, and despite being parents they are still exuberant, identifiable to both young and old.Drac and his merry band are vanilla version of monsters. Each of them produces a couple of timely funny gags, so they don't seem crowded. Visual cues help a lot, not only on creating slapstick humor, but also emotional body language which is occasionally interesting when monsters perform them.There's an underlying message of acceptance, a closer touch on prejudice. It's not entirely spectacular but still a strikingly effective analogy. Most of the humor comes from pop culture references and physical jokes. These may seem excessively flashy, but oddly enough, they are whimsically tickling, especially those on second act.Hotel Transylvania 2 is teeming with average family comedy troupes, although it also brings healthy dose of clever quips and cordial value to merit a viewing."
42,Hotel Transylvania 2,4,27 November 2015,"Forced, awkward and disappointing compared to HT1","We loved the first HT, a great surprise and variety of original characters, constant gags, modern visual humour, well timed animation and a well paced film that seems too short as you are taken along for the enjoyable the ride. HT2 on the other hand has been made slightly off, slightly working too hard to be funny, slightly vetted by a parent company like Sony to make sure the research groups are satisfied. All together it's re-designed characters are too glossy and character movement's are way to over-the-top, voices (especially Jonathan's) are oddly different to the original which irritates as he's such a great relatable and pivotal character throughout the first film - but isn't anything more than a wacky waving inflatable arm man in the second and not really required disappointingly. Clearly a Sony film from the overboard product placement, the gags are those 'toilet ideas' that one first thinks of before vetting which unfortunately they made it to final film and the storyline is just a little 'shit'.Blobbly becomes the character you want to see more of (and I'm sure they will make a ""Blobby goes on vacation"" film if once again user testing agrees), and there are a 'few' funny moments (mainly around the jello form of Blobby as with Monster V Aliens, you can't really go wrong with a wobbling speechless character made of jelly), but my 5y/o who loves HT1 walked out stone faced with HT2.Some funny parts but all in all, the redesigned characters take most of the film to get used to, the story is confusing, you are constantly reminded how bad this one is compared to the first when Jonathan is in frame and feels more as if it's a big corporate film made by suits to sell Sony products and possibly for the figurine sales - not worth it if you like the first.Stars: 2/5 - just."
43,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,26 October 2015,Great movie!,"I watched this movie with my girlfriend. She wanted to watch a movie that put her in a happy mood, and Hotel Transylvania 2 was definitely a great choice. She loved the movie, and she was in a much better mood afterwards. I loved the movie also. I loved the comedy, and even though I feel some jokes were slightly yawners, I still had my heavy laughing moments. I do not normally watch animation, but this was one of the better animations that I have seen. I am happy I went to see this movie, and I think it is appropriate for all ages. Even the older people will still find enjoyment in watching this film. The voices were very well done, and super clear. I loved the distinction between the characters and their voices. The cast was a very great selection. Overall, I gave this movie a 7/10. I feel some jokes could have been more clever, and I feel the movie had it's boring parts. But it is a solid 7/10. I feel like it gives a positive message, and I would see it again. Overall, it was a great movie. I recommend it to anyone who is wanting a ""feel good"" film."
44,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,10 October 2015,Just the same as the first movie,"The story did well in taking a new angle on the entire basic premise from the original movie and developed it in a predictable way. But that's just about it for me. Most of the funny things in this movie had already been out in the trailers already, leaving no longer comedic stuff to laugh at unexpectedly. The movie had only the short one-liners left. Also besides Adam Sandler and the rest of the monster crew, the voice acting really need more attention. Selena Gomez as a mom, really? The movie might as well change the voice actor altogether since Selena didn't even bother to add anything to her voice or intonation as her role changes from a kid into a mom. Andy Samberg as someone from SNL also didn't bring a good weight on the comedy as it's expected from him."
45,Hotel Transylvania 2,4,8 February 2016,Terrible compared to the first film,"So disappointed. I loved the original. This is very poor by comparison. It feels like the person who wrote this totally didn't get the charm of the first film. The whole thing has been stripped of any richness. Jonathon in particular has been totally flattened, he's not even one dimensional, he is a dot. Its like some suits somewhere watched the original, missed all the subtlety and sent out a series of half baked 'funny' scenes for focus groups to evaluate. The predictable result is that all the colors of the first film have been added to the same mixing bowl and the sequel is just kind of brown. Unimaginative, boring and sometimes even offensive in it's stupidity. It feels like my granddad watched fight club and scripted a sequel, without the anarchic element or any hint of mental illness because the whole thing went whooooosh over his head."
46,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,4 October 2015,Hotel Transylvania 2 review,"It's a few years after the events in the first film, Johnny and Mavis get married and have a kid named Dennis. I would say pretty funny, a good a story, and good for kids but the ending is why I gave it a 6. It's just wasn't satisfying. A few plot holes and some corny scenes (mostly the end). It wasn't really like the trailer presented it to be. A lot different and some disappointments. Hotel Transylvania is not good or bad or OK. Not as good as the first one. You should probably see the first one if you haven't. You will laugh a lot and enjoy it too. But all in all a funny and nice storyline. It was a good film and I wouldn't call it a must see, but if you can drop by take your kids, friends, or family and see it in your cinema!"
47,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,30 September 2015,"Drac's Pack is back in Hotel Transylvania 2, continuing to scare up colorful animation and comedy","After the several chances Adam Sandler has had with Just Go With It, Jack & Jill, That's My Boy, Blended and Pixels, you would think that Sony would finally cut their ties with the star. Audiences, especially families used to turn in by the flocks to the theater to see Sandler and his friends spin a yarn about an underachiever who uses their cleverness and potty humor to save the day. For a while, he won easily for the kind of audience that was either low brow or willing to let their children watch anything for entertainment. But most people seemed to caught on with how most of his movies are the same scenario with the easy jokes and predictable plot.The one exception to all of this is Hotel Transylvania. The animated monster movie from 2012 still stands in my book as okay, but it is still undeniably a thousand times more creative and funny then any of the live action Sandler films combined. I'd say this has to do more with the very cartoonish style and writing that uses the Happy Madison crew to their advantages. As with most hit animated features, it was inevitable that Hotel Transylvania 2 would come haunting along. Taking place a couple of years after the first movie, Dracula (Played by Adam Sandler) not only sees his daughter Mavis (played by Selena Gomez) and his new son in law human Johnny (played by Andy Samberg) as a beautiful couple, but he has opened up his hotel up for humans. Adjustment have been made to ensure that both the monsters and human guests are equally comfortable, but no preparation could have prepared Dracula for something that he has always wanted; a grandchild. Mavis and Johnny give birth to what seems like a healthy human boy they name Dennis.But that's it; he may just be a human.Dracula still has some human prejudice, refusing to accept that Dennis is just a human, think that he is a ""late bloomer vampire"". The child has until the age of five to get his fangs, but his mother could care less however he turns out to be. When Mavis suggests that she and her family move, Dracula convinces her to visit her in-laws first while he care for Dennis. Dracula, along with the Frankenstein monster (played by Kevin James), the wolf- man (played by Steve Buscemi), the mummy (played by Keegan-Michael Kay), and the invisible man (played by David Spade) all do everything to train Dennis into a true vampire. They may even have to call in Dracula's father Vlad (played by Mel Brooks)The theme of the Hotel Transylvania movies are tolerance; it's all about the acceptance of those that are different in the family and such. As is, Hotel Transylvania 2 continues to boast some terrific, very cartoony animation whose movement is more prominent then most CGI movies. It's dark, but also colorful. You don't get that a lot with anything monster related.The voice acting is also just as good. Sandler feels really invested as Dracula. It may be obviously him as his voice is distinct to tell, but he's having fun with the part, so it's fun to see where he'll roll with it. What turns me off though are the problems I had with the first movie. It's writing, while witty, still seems a tad lazy. They follow through with the story of a child and his vampire genes, plenty of the side plots are never resolved, or at least resolved too fast. Not to mention that Sony really seemed to have a lot of hands of this project by the painful product placements (Visio computers in an animated movie; Really?) and the modern day pop songs.I'll give this six Dracula capes out of ten. I guess my opinion for the sequel is the same as the first, which was okay. I can understand why people would still like these films regardless, and to be honest, is a good way to introduce children to the classic monsters without scaring them too much. Hotel Transylvania seems far from closing, so check in if you even liked the first one a little bit."
48,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,12 October 2015,Kind of like horror-comedy for kids!,"'HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 2': Three Stars (Out of Five)The blockbuster sequel to 2012's hit animated-horror-comedy flick. This one has Dracula (once again voiced by Adam Sandler) trying to raise his half-human/half-vampire grandson, to be a better monster; so his daughter Mavis (once again voiced by Selena Gomez), won't leave him. Andy Samberg, Kevin James, David Spade, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon and Fran Drescher all return to reprise their roles; while Keegan-Michael Key, Mel Brooks, Nick Offerman, Megan Mullally, Dana Carvey and Rob Riggle all join the voice cast. The film was once again directed by Genndy Tartakovsky and co-written by Robert Smigel; Sandler also served as a screenwriter, this time around. I enjoyed it, at least as much as the first one; if not more.The movie begins with the wedding of Count Dracula's (Sandler) daughter, Mavis (Gomez), and her boyfriend Johnny (Samberg); a human she met in the first film. They have a baby, named Dennis (Asher Blinkoff), a year later. By Dennis's 5th birthday, Dracula is getting extremely worried that Dennis isn't going to have any vampire abilities. He's also worried that Mavis will move her family away, from his hotel, to where Johnny grew up; if this is true. Dracula comes up with a plan to bring out the vampire (he hopes) is in Dennis, with the help of his monster friends.I really like the whole monster world; that Smigel, Sandler and Tartakovsky have created with this film series. It allows for a lot of pretty funny gags and jokes; some really dark and disturbing ones at that (especially for a kids' film). Calling these movies horror- comedy, might seem like a stretch to some; but most of the monsters in these films are definitely horror characters (very classic ones at that). This series is kind of like horror-comedy for kids (at a PG level); it's still pretty dark and twisted, at times though. Which is why I like this movie (and the original); it's actually good comedy coming from Sandler, for a change!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0-wDtevNo"
49,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,25 September 2015,Nice Sequel,"I saw ""Hotel Transylvania 2"", starring the voices of Adam Sandler- Pixels, Coneheads; Andy Samberg-Brooklyn Nine-Nine_tv, That's My Boy; Selena Gomez-Aftershock, Spring Breakers and Mel Brooks-Dracula:Dead and Loving It, Spaceballs.This is a sequel to the 2012 animated hit movie. If you remember, in the first one, Adam played Dracula and ran a hotel for monsters-no humans were allowed. Andy, a human, fell for Adam's daughter, Selena, also a vampire. In this installment, Andy and Selena get married and have a son. Adam is now a grandpa! Everyone wants to know, will the baby be a human or monster? Mel shows up as Vlad, Adam's father, also a vampire. A lot of Adam's real life buddies help out in the voice department, including Kevin James, David Spade, Steve Buscemi and Dana Carvey. If you liked the first one, you should enjoy this one, too. It's rated ""PG"" for scary images, action and some rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes. I liked it and I think my grandkids would too, so I would buy it on DVD."
50,Hotel Transylvania 2,3,5 May 2017,Headache-inducing garbage,"I am only writing this review because of the sheer amount of good reviews that I do not understand. With all respect to the wonderful animators and artists who made this movie at least as visually appealing as it is and the animation is absolutely gorgeous, the writing itself is trash. Most of the characters are one-dimensionally annoying and even a redemption scene didn't manage to make them any more likable. How can you have a movie full of cool monsters and make them into boring cheap ""we-so-hip-and-cool-now"" characters I do not fully understand, but that is exactly what happened here. Honestly, if it weren't for the ever-present emphasis on how much cooler and better the modern culture was and all the dancing and flashing lights, I wouldn't be as harsh on this movie as I am, but god was it irritating to watch. Also, the ending totally ruined any message the movie was trying to convey concerning wee Denis and his humanity. Because hey, it doesn't matter who you are, we love you no matter wha- OH THANK GOD, YOU ARE A VAMPIRE AFTER ALL. To sum up: + great animation and the design is unique enough - story, characters, message of this thing, Dracula (yes, he deserves to be mentioned extra. Loved him in the first movie, profoundly hated him in this one)"
51,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,2 April 2017,An unnecessary sequel,"After the events from the first movie, the two love birds become a couple and have a baby boy which seems to be a human. Dracula is not happy with this aspect so he decides to create a diversion by sending the two in a vacation at his parents'. Meanwhile, with the help of his friends, he is determined to show his grandson the life and pleasures of being a monster, hoping that the little one will understand and somehow grow a pair of vampire fangs.This is, unfortunately, one of those sequels which shouldn't have existed in the first place, sparing us from the curiosity of seeing again the Hotel Transylvania universe. Simply put, the plot is simply lame, lacking any interest or complexity, being there just because it had to have one. The focus is now taken away from the two and moved towards Dracula, in his fixist attempt to prove that his grandson is actually a monster. The whole movie ends with a big battle which is meant to complete the child's race but brings a predictable conclusion which fails to bring something that will somehow rescue the movie from its mediocre state. Yes, it is funny and continues the actions from the original movie, but disappoints from every other aspect, making it a sequel you can easily skip.I honestly hope they won't make a third installment, or at least not in this manner."
52,Hotel Transylvania 2,3,31 October 2016,Hotel Human Clichés,"Hotel Transylvania is a hard act to follow. It was a perfect balance of comedy, vulgarity, family & monsters showing why they are 'cool'. Hotel Transylvania 2 however, is a painful hour & 15 minutes of awkward 'human' behaviour, before the last 10 minutes where the predictable outcome happens. Unfortunately a constant influx of pop culture gags doesn't lessen the unpleasant experience of the frustrating narrative. This film is presented from an adults' perspective. Motherhood is BORING for kids. And watching the adults bicker between themselves just makes the taste all that much more bitter. It's as though the adult-animators were creating the film in their own image. Divorced parents, hell-bent on proving how tough being parents is, & needing to put across how proud they are for the terrible job they've done. Yawn.This happened with Despicable Me 2. When they run out of ideas, it becomes a soap opera with pop culture references. Smart phones. Immediately it becomes dated.There is so much you can do in a universe as flexible as these animations. And yet they resort to the tired unimaginative clichés of parenthood & family turmoil. I know they want to appeals to as many people as possible, but that is about money. Not good entertainment.The Grandpa is the only interesting character in this film because he is being honest, sincere, & cool. Everyone else are acting like being humans. It's no fun at all.The sad thing is everyone bought into it. So now they will pimp this franchise out into the typical animation brothel.Quit while you are ahead, unless you are prepared to top what you achieved originally but going balls to the wall.I'd avoid this if I were you, unless you happen to be one of the docile fawning imbeciles littered within this film."
53,Hotel Transylvania 2,4,2 February 2016,The Big Sandler Money Machine Roles On,"All credit to Adam Sandler who has nailed the formula of creating inoffensive brief animated features with public domain characters and big dance numbers at the end. For this second in what one assumes will be a series that continues as long as the box office is there to support it, Sandler reruns the same jokes about The Invisible Man (David Spade), the Wolfman and his many pups and The Blob whose formlessness comes in handy to save the writing when it gets boxed into a corner. The jokes land solidly with Sandler's 9 to 12 year old demographic and there is the same running around screaming and cartoon humor as you see in similar series such as Kung Fu Panda. In short, it's a film that's keep your kids entertained for 90 minutes and that they won't remember the next week."
54,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,28 October 2015,Great family film,This film and the first we went as a family and loved them both anything with Adam and Kevin you know going to be funny just thought the previews or ads gave to much of plot way. There are jokes for old and young My husband and kids kept saying Blair Blair for days The plot is easy fir kids to follow even if not seen first Which I also recommend for the family The cast voices were great choices Hope they do a third We watched it 2d which was still good This is really a must see for kids even the first also we only go the cinema for special films like thisother wise we watch at home. Even if you have no kids take your nieces and nephews or younger cousins but go and see it feel a kid again and have a laugh
55,Hotel Transylvania 2,5,24 November 2015,As Empty as the First.,"Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015): Dir: Genndy Tartakovsky / Voices: Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, Steve Buscemi: Sequel that pretty much stages the same structure as the first film. It is strange to see a film aimed at children feature creatures from films that children should not see. In fact, it seems to attempt to child proof what should remain for older viewers. Simplistic plot has Jonathan and Mavis expecting their first child and her father, Count Dracula goes nuts hoping that his daughter doesn't move to California where his family is from. Dracula hopes that the child is vampire but fears that the kid is a ""late fanger"". While the couple check out California, Dracula gathers up Frankenstein, the Wolfman, Invisible Man, the green blob thing, etc, as well as the kid in hopes of making the kid grow his fangs. They go on a road trip and individually try out their special scare tactics and every one backfires until Dracula takes the kid to a horror camp that is unexpectedly redone for a safer environment. Both films are well animated and have their share of amusing moments but fall short on the target audience. The climax here works especially when Dracula's father arrives on the scene. Adam Sandler voices Dracula who desires the best for his family but is often too overbearing. Selena Gomez voices Mavis who is in awe of California. Andy Samberg voices Jonathan who attempts to help Dracula persuade Mavis to remain in Transylvania to raise their son. Kevin James voices Frankenstein and Steve Buscemi voices the Wolfman. On par with the first film but its fangs are equally hollow. Score: 5 / 10"
56,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,7 November 2015,"The second trip to the Hotel, is just as entertaining as the first.","Hotel Transylvania 2 continues with the story of Dracula(Adam Sandler), his daughter Mavis(Selena Gomez) & her human husband Jonathan(Andy Samberg). After the events of the first film, Mavis & Jonathan get married. After a year, Mavis gives birth to a half human half vampire son, who she names Dennis(Asher Blinkoff). Drac is worried that Dennis, is more human than vampire. He somehow convinces Mavis & Jonathan to take a vacation & leave Dennis behind. Now, Drac with the help of his friends, Frankenstein(Kevin James), Wayne(Steve Buscemi), Griffin(David Spade), Murray(Keegan Michael-Key) & Blobby(Jonny Solomon) will try their best to bring out the monster in little Dennis. This will also convince Mavis & Jonathan to continue staying in the hotel, instead of living a normal life with Jonathan's parents in California. Hotel Transylvania 2 is an extremely entertaining film. The animation is perfect & the 3D is top notch. The humor in the movie is such that, both the kids & the adults will enjoy themselves. Director Genndy Tartakovsky has maintained the quality of Hotel Transylvania(2012), & has added fun new elements to make sure this film, is not just a retread of the first movie. The addition of humans to the hotel, make for some really hilarious situations. The talented voice cast, is the main reason this movie is hysterical. Adam Sandler is brilliant as Dracula. Andy Samberg is outstanding as Jonathan. Selena Gomez is spectacular as Mavis. Kevin James is superb as Frankenstein. Steve Buscemi is awesome as Wayne. David Spade is amazing as Griffin. Keegan Michael-Key is impressive as Murray. Asher Blinkoff is adorable as Dennis. Fran Drescher & Molly Shannon are effective as Eunice & Wanda respectively. Megan Mullally & Nick Offerman are great as Grandma Linda & Grandpa Mike respectively. Mel Brooks is good as Vlad. Hotel Transylvania 2 is a must watch. Go with your whole family & have a blast!"
57,Hotel Transylvania 2,5,30 October 2017,Too stylized,"I watched this movie in 3D, which should be an immersive experience.The animations are done very well, the direction or writing is *very* bad. The movie doesn't flow and feels like it pulled apart another animation movie, made their observations into ""rules and laws"" and recomposed it in fragments. So it turns out to be a mozaïque of something else trying to be something new. It didn't work.The entire movie felt as if they have made a storyboard and had sent these boards slide by slide to the animation department to render the scenes without any transition. And then over-manage the scenes while there isn't any transition. Like a slideshow.Added to this, when two characters interact, the atmosphere is gone. It's usually an empty room, slightly faded in the background. The only moment there is much going on is on the party, but then there is too much chaos to take it all in. While other scene's were rushed in and felt empty. While music felt artificially placed instead of blending away.For example, you have a dialogue character one says something. Expression. second character does a motion and expression in a different scene it seems. Zip back to the first character, says another thing. Slight pauze. Then the other character frowns, in another setting it seems. Back closeup to the first character. It's too, fragmented. And doesn't flow. This movie doesn't flow at all. It's like sitting in an amusementpark ride, and a sensor trips to display a scene of animatronics. The door closes, the animatronics die out. Another opens. Another animatronic.Not even to mention the attempt to put in some stereotypes through voicing. The voicing is so without emotion and so dry. Say line. Stop. Say next line. Stop. The animators on this movie were very wonderful, the others not so much. It was a waste of my time and probably you too."
58,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,16 December 2016,Bad Grandpa...Well sort of.,"This is one of those sequels that is whatever. It's somewhat serviceable but it's very generic, narrow and easily forgettable. They basically tried to milk the premise by dragging out a very simple story with a bunch of slapstick humor and pop culture references. Which a lot of animated sequels tends to do when they are out of ideas but needs to make a certain run time. What makes this movie watchable is the cute factor and the slightly endearing parts (although few) when dealing with the family dynamics. This time around it deals with the two lovers from the previous one getting a child. And most of it revolves around Dracula trying to figure out if his grandchild is also part vampire or not. So they go on a journey to try and bring out the vampire in the child while the parents are away. And while this is going on, the parents which is composed of a female vampire and a male human go around doing human activities while the female vampire is all fascinated by the stuff and activities humans do. I will say, just 5 minutes into this movie I could clearly see where this story was going to go. I even called the ending, which is composed of the kid showing his true identity and the humans and monsters dancing around and celebrating to modern pop music. I say just pass on this one, unless you really want to see the next chapter in this franchise which should have just ended with the first one. It's not a awful movie but it's just another CGI animated movie for kids that is watchable.6/10"
59,Hotel Transylvania 2,5,7 October 2016,Family growing,"Adam Sandler can still reach an audience (there are and were people who did argue otherwise, not unrightfully so). It may be a very young one and it does make sense to watch it with young ones too. It is a lot more fun seeing kids laughing at the most ridiculous things, that can under normal circumstances not be deemed funny.But it works for what it is and while I'd still tell anyone to rather watch a quality animated movie (Big Hero 6, Up, Brave and more), there is always room for something like this. And there has to be even more room for this kind of movie, considering a third one is announced. Whether you like it or actually really love it or not ..."
60,Hotel Transylvania 2,5,24 May 2016,Feels like several TV show episodes strung together,"Hotel Transylvania 1 was disliked by critics for some reason or another. At first, I didn't like the first movie based on appearances; however,it turned out to be a really fun movie. Granted, it was a little too heavy on pop-references at times, but it was fast, funny, and energetic (a kind of movie we haven't had since Warner Brothers animation). And fortunately, the movie also had heart with a strong focus on the main characters.However, this movie is not like the first movie.The most glaring issue with this movie is the pacing... it is bad... but not in an obvious sort of way. What makes this film so strange is that the plot is not consistent and you don't really know what is going on or why things happen. About every 20 minutes it feels like the plot is completely different. Just when I thought the movie was almost over, I realized that there was still 30 minutes left. It truly is confusing how this movie is strung together. Instead of feeling like a coherent adventure, it seems more several short stories strung together. To make things worse, the movie can't focus on a central character to focus on. This, in itself, is pretty annoying. While Dracula is obviously the main character, it constantly shifts who we are following, which means that by the end of the film very few of the characters get proper development or screen time. Dennis (the newcomer) is a fantastically cute kid, and we get hints of the different struggles he is going through; however, he is also an interesting character who is missing a lot of screen-time. The same goes with Mavis and Jonathan. The two don't have a lot of chemistry and I desperately wanted a moment where the two of them could feel at peace with each other. The entire film there is conflict between the two and there is no sense of love. And then there are gags... like the last movie, there are a ton of gags and they are very fast. There were a couple (notably, Mavis biking for the first time) that were really funny, but about 70% of them were very odd. For instance, in one scene, Frankenstein is talking to Dracula and stumbles across his closet and decides to try on Dracula's clothes while Dracula isn't paying attention... I don't get it. What's the joke? Why was that thrown in there? It just doesn't flow, and the movie is full of a lot of moments like this where jokes don't fit the flow of the plot.Now what about the conflict... is it good? Not really, because I feel like a lot of the conflict could've been finished with one good conversation between the main-characters... and that goes for the finale as well. The finale involves a lot of fighting, but it doesn't make sense because all of the action revolves around Dennis not being a vampire... but then he turns out to be a vampire. So then shouldn't the action stop? The conflict has been resolved, but instead it goes into this massive fight of good vs evil or something along those lines. What makes this conflict worse is that this big fight all revolves around the Count's Father who doesn't even show up until Act III. So all of the fighting does't make sense, because Act III is the climax of a story, but then Act III in this movie has its own separate Act I, Act II, and Act III. In short, a TV show episode squeezed in for the finale.All in all the movie isn't horrible. The animation is really fast and clever, and everything is cleverly stylized. However, looks can't save a movie. The main focus of the movie should've been more on the characters, and less on the comedy and constant movement.Oh, and don't get me started on all of the marketing references in this movie. This movie focuses a lot of its time on cell-phones and Sony equipment... a lot of time..."

62,Hotel Transylvania 2,4,17 October 2015,Poor sequel filled with blatant product placement - shame on Sony,"Enjoyed the first movie with the kids. This was overall a pale imitation with a thinner plot and often aimless pace. Kids of course did not notice the difference so much, so I'd suggest this may be one from adults to sit out, if possible.And then there is the advertising: The plot was needlessly suffused with Sony-branded phone/video chat throughout - new depths in product-placement plumbed. Anyone spot the Vaio laptop too?! Ads before the movie I expect, but this was shameless.Oh and I thought Hollywood was done with Jewish caricatures of the 1930's National Socialist genre. I'm surprised the anti-semitic watch groups haven't pickup up on it yet."
63,Hotel Transylvania 2,4,18 October 2015,A bit of a letdown,"Drac. and co. return for the second go around at Transylvania's newest hotspot hotel, but I found the laughs to be curiously absent this time. Mavis and her guy want to take their young son out of Transylvania, and relocate to California, while her father doesn't want them to leave. So he tries to scare the boy into becoming a vampire (I think that sentence should end with a question mark)Once again, the animation looks exceptional, if a bit darker in tone than the previous film, but this time around, there is so much father/ daughter drama that it drowns out a lot of the laughs. Works best in the latter scenes, but its final twist undermines its whole ""accept everyone for who they are"" message.The film's closing credits account for more than eleven minutes of the film's 88 minutes long run time."
64,Hotel Transylvania 2,4,18 October 2015,"Meh , nowhere near the first HT","Just went to watch it with my family and wish I waited for the DVD. The movie is a collection of so-so jokes , the script is not well developed and most of the time relies on recycled jokes. My 7 year old was mildly entertained but my 10 year old was bored , barely smiling really trying to enjoy this movie . Forced laughs are pretty much the signature of Adam Sandler movies and HT2 is pretty much scripted and executed by Mr Sandler who beside the excellent voice for Dracula managed to ruin the movie by adding his style to the script. Last 25-30 minutes where somehow better but not by much. All in all this movie is the typical No 2 , riding on the success of the original movie but not being able to bring anything new to the table. I would suggest to wait for the DVD release instead of dropping almost $80 like I did for a family of 5."
65,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,27 September 2016,"A respectable sequel that provides a fun time, but ultimately lacks anything too special or memorable.","I am never usually too excited for sequels, especially children's animated sequels and Hotel Transylvania was no exception to this. I enjoyed the first movie enough to warrant trying the sequel and ultimately, I'm glad I gave it a go. This movie picks up several years on from the first movie, Dracula's Grandson has been born and as time progresses Dracula's anxiety increases as he fears his Grandson may have human genes as oppose to vampire ones. The world has progressed significantly since the first movie and monsters now live peacefully alongside humans, the fear factor has gone and the divide between the two has largely vanished. The animation is spot on with vibrant colours and crystal clear, beautiful shots. The world that was created in the first movie is just as good second time around and the creativity is just as impressive. All the main characters fit the scene very well and all the supporting extras that fill our screens are designed with great detail and uniqueness. Overall, the visuals are very good, appealing to children as you would expect but I also feel that adults will also appreciate it for how well it is created.A large issue I had with this movie was that the pacing during the first half of the movie was all over the place. We were rushed through his growing up years where I believe much good storytelling could have been provided to add some depth to the movie. Another negative for me was the lower quality of writing/comedy. The first movie had 5 writers on board while the sequel only had 2, with the biggest problem being that one of them was Adam Sandler. Along with Adam Sandler comes the Adam Sandler aspect that I have grown to hate over the past few years: The potty, slapstick humour. Now, it's a kid film, I can appreciate that but some of the potty humour is a little meh as far as I'm concerned. My last real negative was the final scene, the climax scene felt a little lacking as I found the 'villains' to be not that interesting and the overall scene felt very childish and even video game like. I have a feeling that a third movie will be added to this franchise and I fear that will be one too many. The first movie was great, second did a pleasant job of continuing the story but a third isn't necessary. Overall, it's a solid sequel which is worth a viewing if you liked the first movie but expect some more childish scenes and a story-line which doesn't hold up too strongly.6/10"
66,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,8 February 2016,Fun and goofy,"Genndy Tartakovsky wins again with Hotel Transylvania 2. A film that while not as good as its predecessor still manages to warm our hearts up and make them chilly. Hotel Transylvania is a story about family and that theme is pushed further here in this film giving a plot on Johnny and Mavis getting married and then having a child. Throughout the film we see that the child shows no vampire qualities at all. But Dracula keeps on trying to get him to show off those abilities but none show, and so Dracula does not give up as he has to make Dennis a vampire in order to make sure that Mavis sticks around. The characters here are all great. I love Dracula, Mavis and especially Johhny. Adam Sandler and Kevin James transform into these characters for this animated feature. Making it so good and so much fun for all of us to really be able to enjoy. Mel Brooks also is great here and Vlad. Bringing in a big push that the characters have to overcome. This film does suffer from the characters lacking a lot of drive to make them grow. While Dracula has changed a lot from the first film a lot of the other characters feel stagnant and don;t always seem like they have learned a lot from the past. For instance Mavis makes a lot of quick and fast judgments without much thought and says some words that go against the thoughts of the other characters. I know these are character flaws, but there flaws that need to be addressed. The ending is also a bit of a disappointment. Feeling pretty lack luster and dull the ending of this adds nothing of relevance and takes on the more Hollywood approach. Once again not allowing the characters to really grow and change. Overall despite the issues with the film I did like it a lot and because of that it deserves a high score. I just wish a few things could of been done a bit better, but that in no way should take away from the strength of this film."
67,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,27 January 2016,Fun.... but!,"Sandler probably found his niche, just place him in an animated feature about someone stuck in the past trying (not successfully but trying) to accept the modern age. The Sequel plays off the ending of the first movie with the couples now having a son and dear old Sandler trying to be a grandparent that pushes for the old ways to make a come back.over all its a cute movie with fun situations thrown in. the jokes that land are funny and sometimes unexpected. The children in the theater were glued to their seats so always a good thing BUT there are two problems with this movie. some of the tie in music was painfully forced, you could tell they only had it in there for the money... then there's the ending... total sell out ending... if the movie had ended just before then it would have gotten 8 stars from me as a fun time for the family but that ending was such a cup out that it's impossible to forgive.Overall a fun movie for the kids and tolerable for adults. give it a rent over the weekend for the little ones, just keep in mind this is for the kids and not for you."
68,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,2 January 2016,"As others mentioned, only the first 50 minutes are worth","The first 50 minutes are nice to watch, not too scary and kids in the theater where laughing at times. Even for adults it was mildly entertaining and not boring. It has a reasonable pace, and the story catches the attention. At some moments the characters are funny and entertaining.After 50 minutes in the movie, the father of Dracula appears along with some old ugly vampires of his guard. This brings into the movie some scary and uglier elements which I'm not sure are pleasant for small children. Also, from this moment the movie turns into a different story which is less funny and pleasant to look at."
69,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,1 December 2015,"First saw the second,than I saw the first,realized second should have been third.","How is that for a summary? I'll try to explain...so here it is.I liked this movie but saw a lot of flaws especially with montage bits and the stretching of scenes. First act has to many repetitive scenes and the kid's birthdays were a good example of this. Mel Brooks comes way to late in to the movie and has a real lack of strength in his role.The side characters bring the most fun to this movie and Mavis being overprotective for the baby makes her role very annoying and not very sympathetic. Also her telling Drac she is pregnant felt like an ""off""scene but maybe that's something personal.What they should have done, is to let the relationship of Mavis and Jonathan develop more and make it more about monsters and human interacting because I think that is not explored enough in both these movies.Than as a third act you could have gotten the wedding and some of the growing up of the baby to lead as a cliffhanger into the third movie.So...this could have been better than the first ,which I thought, was somewhat better than this.Overall still 2 very enjoyable films, both at least worthy of checking out.Have a bloody good time... (but not to bloody it's still a kiddie flick)"
70,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,21 November 2015,Fun sequel,"It is actually not too long ago that i watched the first ""Hotel Transylvania"" movie and I remember liking it. Same can be said about this second movie. It is a fun watch from start to finish and I laughed quite a bit during this entertaining 90 minutes. The first 5 minutes basically not only span over several years, but also include crucial events like a wedding and even a main character giving birth. Following these events, the movie is basically all about the way the little boy turned out. Is he a vampire or a human? I must say I predicted the outcome very quickly, but it's not a problem at all as it did not take away from the fun. Still the first half was probably better than the second. It became a bit too serious for its own good in terms of the origin in doubt I just mentioned. Also these super-evil creatures that belonged to the great grandfather were slightly over the top in terms of how wicked they were.My favorite part was probably the sequence where the bunch travels in order to show the boy how great it is to be evil. Quite the road trip and amazing fun. I loved the green blob. He was hilarious. And I also liked the Bigfoot references (goalkeeper, audio book). All in all, this may not have the dramatically convincing moments of a Pixar movie, but in terms of humour and comedy it wasn't far behind. The animation was pretty excellent as well. A great watch for young audiences, a good watch for grown-ups. If Tartakovsky and Sandler decide to make a third film, I will certainly give it a watch. I hope it will be as convincing as this second movie. Thumbs up. One of 2015's finest in animation."
71,Hotel Transylvania 2,4,7 October 2015,Went downhill pretty much fast.,"'Hotel Transylvannia 2' is a perfect example of a wasted opportunity. It started out surprisingly good, however, it failed to maintain the fun that it delivered in the first half of the movie.The first-half of this movie was just dumb-fun, it's fun to watch. However, the second-half was just atrocious, t'was almost unwatchable. It felt awkward (at least for me) to watch. It just felt so forced, it was horribly written, and it concluded the worst way one could've ever thought of; it was abysmal.To mention some of the positive things about the movie, I thought that the animation was great, voice acting was nicely done, and its first half, at least, was an improvement over its predecessor's first-half.I'm giving this movie a 4/10."
72,Hotel Transylvania 2,5,11 October 2015,A Shallow Movie Directed Solely at Kids,"Hotel Transylvania 2 is a fun, yet equally silly movie, that amounts to an inconsequential movie directed solely at kids. If you have kids, this is a good movie to take them to, because it's funny and beautifully animated. However, if you hope you'll enjoy the film also, you may be disappointed. The voice cast is good, and some of the characters are well developed, but the film is very silly. The movie lacks a feeling of relevance, because there are no real consequences, and thus lacks any emotional depth. The silly tone makes the film good for little children, and if you liked the first film, you'll likely enjoy this one as well, but those looking for anything other than kids fluff, will be disappointed. In conclusion Hotel Transylvania is funny, sleek, and perfect for small children, but falls flat when it comes to delivering any real emotional depth, and ends up shallow."
73,Hotel Transylvania 2,5,25 September 2015,Animated Adam Sandler Misadventure,"According to the 2012 animated film, Count Dracula ran ""Hotel Transylvania"" as a resort for monsters who wanted to get away from the humans who frighten them. One day, a human boy named Jonathan stumbles upon the existence of this hotel and falls for the Gothic charms of Dracula's daughter Mavis. Being the over-protective dad that he was, single-dad Dracula does everything to keep the two from falling in love.In this sequel, Jonathan and Mavis got married and have a son Dennis. Dracula was very concerned that his grandson Dennis was already turning five, but was not showing any signs of being a vampire. So while Mavis and Jonathan fly to California to visit his parents, Dracula and his wacky gang of monsters bring Dennis to a vampire summer camp, hoping the kid's fangs come out faster.From the poster alone, we already know that this sequel will be a cute juvenile romp with delightful ""monsters"". The story line is reminiscent of other films, like ""Sky High"" or ""The Incredibles,"" about the distress caused by an offspring who apparently did not have the superpowers of his parents. In the first film, the laughs came from Dracula struggling with the problem of his daughter falling in love with a human. In this sequel, it was also Dracula's struggles about this grandson that make this film funny (mildly) more than anything else.Since this is a sequel, the artwork was basically the same as the first one, with most of the characters coming back to reprise their roles. Curiously, the look of the new main character baby Dennis was not at all original. With his full head of wild curly red hair, Dennis looked almost exactly like the baby brothers of Merida in ""Brave."" The design of Great Grandpa Vlad and more so his scary sidekick Bela and his army of ghoulish vampire bats could be the stuff of nightmares for very young kids. The special effect of flames looked very good.Adam Sandler's voice was very apparent as Count Dracula. You can totally imagine him talking in that ""Dracula"" accent. The cast list boasts of an impressive roster of noted comedians past and present who were all able to project their comic personas through their voice work for their characters. Of course, Sandler's usual movie posse is there composed of Kevin James (as Frankenstein), Steve Buscemi (as Werewolf Wayne), and David Spade (as Invisible Man Griffin). Andy Samberg plays the goofy Jonathan opposite teen star Selena Gomez as Mavis. In smaller supporting roles are Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman (as human grandparents Linda and Mike), Dana Carvey (as Camp Counselor Dana), Fran Drescher (as Frankenstein's wife Eunice), and the most esteemed Mel Brooks (as Vlad).This another one of those zany, hyper, and yes, predictable animated films for the juvenile set, ultimately not too memorable. Despite the illustrious cast of comics though, the big laughs in this film are only few and far between. At most, a smile or a little chuckle here and there are all you get. Despite some disturbing scenes of apparent child endangerment in this film, you know this is all done in the spirit of silly fun and nothing bad is really going to happen. 5/10."
74,Hotel Transylvania 2,4,28 October 2015,Adorable Disappointment,"Sequel to the 2012 movie Hotel Transylvania, I went into this movie with hopes of a cute, happy movie. I mean, it's meant and aimed towards children, right? It met all those needs, but the plot could have used some work. The first movie was so great it gave me slightly higher expectations for the second, which was where I went wrong because it's rare a sequel is better than the first. What I expected was for them to slightly focus on the child getting his vampire teeth and then move on to show the rest of their life or something more interesting than watching Dracula try and force his grandchild to be a vampire. Not saying it was all bad, as it was very interesting to see how far the monsters had come technology wise and seeing how accepting they had become of others. The rest of the movie was just so dull with a few funny moments thrown in. There was nothing to it to get me excited to watch the rest of the movie like the first film did. I was excited for it to end, to put it simply. It's not the worst movie by far, and of course it's a kids movie, but come on. If I can guess the ending of the movie before even stepping into the theater, something is wrong."
75,Hotel Transylvania 2,4,24 September 2015,"For a monster animation comedy, Hotel Transylvania 2 has a lot of fangs but no bite.","While the first film didn't raise the bar for animation, screwball humor laced with sight gags and a heartfelt message resulted in ghoulish fun for everyone. With Hotel Transylvania 2, the Drac pack is back for another non-stop adventure, and it tries to be as vibrant and energetic as the first film.Picking up where the first film ended, Hotel Transylvania 2 begins with Mavis (Selena Gomez) and Jonathan's (Andy Samberg) wedding after Dracula (Adam Sandler) has a change of heart. Acceptance over prejudice formed the overbearing message in the first film with Dracula finally embracing Jonathan as his would-be son-in-law, despite the latter being human. It was a sweet but predictable ending to a burlesque farce. Then it happens all over again when Drac becomes a grandpa in this sequel. Fixated that his grandson (who looks exactly like one of the ginger-head kids in Pixar's Brave) isn't showing signs of his vampire heritage, Drac and his undead buddies set out to give the toddler a crash course in becoming a little monster. Meanwhile, Drac's dad Vlad (Mel Brooks) is awakened by all the ruckus and goes bat crazy (pun intended) when he hears that his great-grandson is half human.The film takes another stab at culture shock when Mavis meets her human in-laws (Meet the Parents?), but by this time it's déjà vu for anyone who has seen the previous film. That overcoming discrimination and accepting people as they are is a commendable theme for an animation, but haven't we seen this before? Although well intentioned, the bigger question is whether this message permeates with juvenile thinking. And as expected, thrown into the mix is the crude humor that has become an Adam Sandler insignia. How well this works depends largely on how the first film was received. Call it an encore, but whatever worked in the first film seems to have found its way in this sequel via a rehashed story and that isn't saying much for originality.That said, it doesn't take rocket science to entertain a kid these days. With virtually everyone returning, the best parts are when certain characters are at their slapstick best with zany voice talents from the supporting cast. Unsurprisingly, and since this is a Sandler film, the cast includes Steve Buscemi, David Spade, and Kevin James, all last seen together in Grown Ups. Together, they have what it takes to make kids laugh but I doubt parents and other adults will respond the same way. It's not that Hotel Transylvania 2 is horrible or boring. It's just that this film isn't nearly as intelligent or emotionally powerful as even the most mediocre films from Pixar. And that's saying a lot for a film with plenty of fangs but no bite."
76,Hotel Transylvania 2,5,28 September 2015,Animated Dracula can't wait for grandson to grow up.,"Sony Pictures counting on getting some laughs from viewers of all ages. This time around Adam Sandler gets co-credit for writing. Most of the same voices for characters in the original return. Definitely busy, but how does that relate to being good? It has been five years since Dracula(Sandler)became a grandfather. It was something to endure just to have his daughter Mavis(Serena Gomez) marry a laid-back human, Jonathan(Andy Samberg). Drac is faced with his monster-hotel cohorts still having troubles to accept each others' differences; and the impatient vampire is suffering high anxiety waiting for his grandson, Dennis(Asher Blinkoff), to grow fangs...that is if he has inherited the the right genes. He is sure of it; but he wants to speed up the process.This is mainly just more of the same wisecracks from the original. I'm wondering if this sequel can garner equal popularity and box office haul of the earlier frantic formula.Other recognizable voices featured: Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, Fran Drescher, Dana Carvey, Molly Shannon, Jon Lovitz, Mel Brooks and David Spade."
77,Hotel Transylvania 2,9,3 December 2017,Thumbs up,"I just saw this (2017), and for a senior citizen (& Vlad fan), I got a kick out of it;so many quotable quotes (was it 'OMSatan' or OMDevil'?; I didn't know which way the plot was going but a great ending; looking forward to 2018 production; nice to have stars doing the rolls; I couldn't tell who was who for sure, so went to IMDb; in the meantime, will see if I can find the first of the series. :-} :-} :-} :-}"
78,Hotel Transylvania 2,1,15 March 2017,Sign me up!!!,"My kids want me to see the new sequel (#3) when it comes out. I told them that as long as it has A) a father who can't let go of his daughter, B) an exciting last-minute chase, C) they learn a valuable, maudlin-laced lesson and D) they all sing and dance at the end, and play a pop-song over the credits (oooh, with ""outtakes"" as well), then SIGN ME UP!!! They can use this formula over and OVER again and it will NEVER get old."
79,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,18 November 2016,Should have been higher!!,"Dracula and his friends try to bring out the monster in his half human, half vampire grandson in order to keep Mavis from leaving the hotel. The sequel expanded upon the original the film and it was even funnier than before with that scene that Dracula throws his grandson and waits for him to fly but eventually it never happens or the big showdown in the end was also really cool and i hope that some time in the near future a Hotel Transylvania 3 does happen and shows the kid a bit older going on a adventure with his grandfather and his friends but also with his parents and face some ancient evil or something i don't know maybe even werewolves that are evil and try to take over the world. But anyways it's still one cool film and you won't be disappointed"
80,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,13 November 2016,Hotel Transylvania 2 (2013),"Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015) Starring: Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Keegan- Michael Key, Asher Blinkoff, Fran Drescher, Molly Shannon, Megan Mullally, Nick Offerman, Dana Carvey, Rob Riggle, Mel Brooks, Jonny Solomon, Chris Kattan, Sadie Sandler, Sunny Sandler, Jon Lovitz, and Robert Smigel Directed By: Genndy Tartakovsky Review THEY'RE BACK TO RAISE A LITTLE TERROR Halloween may be over but there's always time for monsters. The first Hotel Transylvania movie was something I saw last minute with my sister back in when it came out in theaters, this sequel I didn't see in theaters. Even though I kind of wanted to considering I actually thought that the first film is probably Adam Sandlers best film in my opinion. This sequel sets up in the Hotel( of course) with Mavis and Johnny getting married. One year after they have a child which they name Dennis. Johnny sets up more human type-activity's in the hotel for Dennis to make it safer for him because he isn't a monster. Dracula sets up a plan to have Mavis and Johnny spend a week in California while Dracula and his friends try to make Dennis a monster. This sequel I thought when the trailer came out was unnecessary. Your probably thinking that too. If so your right but if you liked the first film you should at least give this watch it has some funny moments and the final act is pretty cool. It has the same kind of good acting from the first film and I liked the voice for Vlad whoever he was. I'm giving Hotel Transylvania 2 a three out of five."
81,Hotel Transylvania 2,6,11 November 2016,The sequel cebause of the sequel,"This sequel was really without the humour of part 1. Where in the original the atmosphere was breathtaking, this was just hey, look at how funny us monsters can be like. Lots of jokes for adults only to understand or appreciated. So short slapstick kind of takes but no real story let alone character developing. The kids a was watching this movie with were quiet almost throughout the whole movie except for the end were finally some plot came about. We really loved the characters from the original movie so it was fun to see them again but it was sometimes painful to see all the short jokes I understood went blank on the kids. A solid 6 stars though. Not too shabby for a Friday night."
82,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,23 October 2016,Lightning Almost Hits Twice,"When I was in high school, I started a comic strip called ""Horror Inc."" It was loosely part-""Casper,"" part-""Addams Family"" and part-""Far Side"" as it developed the satirical side of ghost stories and horror movies in general. I developed almost 200 single-panel toons in the series, but I was never able to get it published much less get interest in it for distribution. If it had been animated, it would have been very much like ""Hotel Transylvania"" with an under-appreciated Dracula, a tired Frankenstein Monster, an exhausted Wolfman and a disrespected Mummy surrounded by various unsuccessful horror serial killers bungling their way through a universe where ghosts and zombies struggle to live normal lives. That's why I love ""Hotel Transylvania"" so much; it was a rip- off of my material, but it was a condensed roller coaster ride of it highlighted by the talents of Selena Gomez, Adam Sandler and friends. Sadly, as great as the first movie is, ""Hotel Transylvania 2"" doesn't seem to catch the same creative lightening in a bottle as the first movie, which by itself, didn't really need a sequel unless it was a strong enough script to warrant it. Unfortunately, the plot we get isn't nearly as strong as I would have hoped. In the movie, Dracula's daughter, Mavis has married Jonathan, her first love, and has become a parent herself. (Being a vampire, I don't get how this is possible.) There's some great comedy with Dracula as a grandfather and with Mavis in the real world, but where the movies fails is in repeating much of the same jokes of the first movie. Truth be told, ""Hotel Transylvania 2"" isn't a bad movie; there's a lot of great material in it, but where it drags is in the form of Dennis, Mavis and Jonathan's son as Dracula waits to see if he will be a vampire. The kid isn't funny, he's a plot device, and the movie wastes so much time on him, but there are volumes of new material to be made off the expanded universe of monsters, undead and assorted creatures trying to cohabitate with humans. Some of the better jokes involve giving human frailties and idiosyncrasies to Dracula and the other monsters. Of course, the mere fact that Mavis being undead and Jonathan still being immature makes them very unlikely parents, facts that also interfere and deter from the overall humor of the movie. It would have worked so much better if Mavis and Jonathan were still just dating, and Mavis was just still discovering the real world. Still, there's a lot of humor to appeal to children and youths alike. Sandler shines as Dracula again, as does Gomez, David Spade, Kevin James, Keegan-Michael Key (replacing Cee-Lo Green) in their roles, though Steve Buscemi doesn't have nearly the room he originally had to really explode as he did in the first movie. The animation is just as vivacious as the first, and most of the comedy is equal parts wacky and clever, but the plot just doesn't have the emotional impact as the first. Mel Brooks as Drac's dad is dragged in way too late, which is a shame considering the man's legendary talent. Only Brooks could have yanked this movie out from under Sandler and company, but his material is sadly restrained by the character he plays. ""Hotel Transylvania 2"" is a great follow-up to the first movie, but in this instance, I think there was an obvious missed opportunity to let it excel the original."
83,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,29 September 2016,"Better than the first, and funny as Heaven!","*You have to watch the movie to get the punchline of my subject heading. Suffice to say it's the funniest joke in the movie, one that had me pause the movie so I could belly-laugh for about ten minutes.Nitpicking is a subject in which a person spends too much time looking at the tiny little flaws in the fabric to appreciate the painting. Sometimes I catch myself doing this, and when I do, I try to admit it.But sometimes I'm not picking at the nits. Sometimes I'm wondering why the art has a gigantic hole punched through the canvas that nobody can see.One of the flaws of the first HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA was that it bent the rules it tried to set in such a way as to ignore them completely. The immediate defense to this, I've been told, is that ""It's just a kid's movie."" Technically speaking, ZOOTOPIA is a kid's movie. And it's excellent. And it doesn't break its own rules just to get around corners.The original HOTEL had a vampire girl looking at a sunset and not vaporizing to dust. It had Drac flying for a terribly long time in direct sunlight without exploding into flame. It had Drac make a delivery of Johnny in an impossible quick-fix at the end of the movie. I guess Drac somehow pulled Johnny from the plane without crashing it, and managed to carry him all the way to the castle without burning himself to a crisp. See, if you're going to throw out the rules altogether, don't make any in the first place. If you do make rules in the first place, you have to stick to them, or you destroy the flow of the movie.All that aside, its sequel, HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 2, was a laugh riot. I haven't laughed this much at a movie in a really long time, and I was really happy that I had the chance to see it.It's not perfect. The end scene is as heavy-handed as scenes get, over-the-top cheesy in a tongue-in-cheek slapstick kind of way. Mel Brooks is all but wasted as Vlad, Drac's pop. It's cool that he's there, it's wonderful to hear his voice, but that's all that he gets. I would think a few jokes in his vein of comedy, or maybe some subtle references to his line of movies might have been nice.The story is understandable enough. Mavis wants to try and live the ""normal"" life (though I can't even start to figure out how she would even GO there, what with her being unable to be in sunlight and all). Drac wants Dennis to be a vampire, despite the fact that he so far is only shown to be human. So the conflict is real How do you keep Dennis in Transylvania, while Mavis wants to take him to Humanville?Everything else aside, the reason to watch this movie is to laugh. The plot is thick enough to sustain the jokes, and the jokes are a mile a minute. It's sweet, it's charming, and above all, it's funny. Despite the few moments where you might roll your eyes and look away from the screen, you probably will find yourself looking back anyway, just to make sure you're not missing any of the jokes.This movie qualifies in that rare vein of movies that use the momentum of the first to surpass it, flying by the original to be a very solid, fun movie. I recommend it to anyone looking for a reason to just sit back and laugh."
84,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,7 September 2016,First one was better - still a good one,"The first one was such a big surprise. It goes without saying that this one was also really nice. Lots of laughs even for adults and a really nice script. I loved the animations, keeping a right balance between scary and cheesy. It was a really pleasant movie to watch for a grown up, so I can imagine that kids would definitely love it too. Loved the great vampa figure (no spoiler there) and definitely liked the monsters in this one too. The movie was relaxed, did not drag out too long and again it was filled with action and laughs. I think that this is the last of its kind on the same topic. I guess that if they go out to do a third one, it will have to be on a completely different topic. Having said that, I hope that if the trilogy is completed, it will be with something even more hysterical!"
85,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,9 July 2016,"A hilarious, sweet sequel","This movie starts where the earlier one left off. Johnny(Andy Samberg) and Mavis(Selena Gomez) are finally settled and sharing a great rapport with Dracula(Adam Sandler) and the other monsters in Hotel Transylvania. They have a baby boy Dennis, who is a half human, half vampire. Now, as a grandfather, Drac is desperate to make Dennis into a vampire before he turns 5, in order to keep Mavis in the hotel. The methods he applies to bring out the monster in him is hilarious. Though the other monsters are reluctant, Drac is hell bent to see his grandson's fangs pop out. That is an absolute delight to watch.The film maintains that the monsters are afraid of humans and Drac is a rigid disciplinarian. It also portrays the challenges of the latest technology that the older generation face. All in all, a good sequel and a fun watch for people of all ages:)"
86,Hotel Transylvania 2,5,30 May 2016,"If you liked the first , surely will like this","Hotel Transylvania 2 is much less than its predecessor, it is less fun and funny, the characters are back , plus some new ones, as the father of Dracula , which is pretty cool scene he appears, the voice work continues very good, and the film's story is a bit different from the previous , the soundtrack is good, and the final moments are legal , Dracula 's grandson is kind of boring , I did not get to laugh with him , Dracula this really fun as well as in the first movie , Hotel Transylvania 2 is less than its predecessor, the new characters , taking the father of Dracula , they are bland, and the story of the film is to cool , if you liked the first movie , surely will like this , more if you did not like the first, pass away from that . Note 5.2"
87,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,23 May 2016,"Inferior to the first film, to me though it was much better than expected","The first 'Hotel Transylvania' was surprisingly good, after expecting to dislike it. The sequel has garnered mixed reviews, though a fair few of them have been negative, some thought it was great fun while others disliked it intensely.With me, my opinion is in the former camp. It is less than perfect, could have been much better and is inferior to the first film, but it was much better than expected and was quite enjoyable.Starting with the many good points, the animation is great, vibrantly colourful, vivid, never blocky and meticulously detailed. The character designs, which this reviewer noticed were debits for some people for some people (a few of them deeming them as the ugliest of any animated film in the first, this reviewer personally has seen far worse), are improved here. The soundtrack is very catchy and fits very well.Dialogue is witty and hilarious, avoiding going into distaste and immaturity. And the gags hit more than they miss, coming by thick and fast, the highlights being the enormous tears, the slow getaway and the alternative lullaby. Despite the message being slightly vague, it does give the film some heart and charm. There is also a surprisingly tender moment with Drac flying together with Mavis.'Hotel Transylvania 2's' story is paper-thin and somewhat of a predictable rehash admittedly, but there is still a lot going on that stops it from being dull. Drac is a hugely entertaining main character, and Adam Sandler gives one of his better performances to me since 'Reign Over Me'. The voice work generally is solid, the other standouts being Kevin James (also giving one of his funnier performances of late), Mel Brooks and the ever dependable Steve Buscemi. Most of the characters are nicely done, with the exceptions of one-dimensional Jonathan and annoying Mavis.On the other hand, there are some major debits here. The biggest problem is the rather disastrous last act, which is a cop out and brings down 'Hotel Transylvania 2' more than one notch. It is also contradictory (the message that is), feels like a completely different film, it tries to do far too much making it very bloated and it was really pointless making Dennis a vampire.Jonathan and Mavis are barely developed and are more annoying than engaging, Andy Samburg and Selena Gomez's voice work completely lacks spark. Some of the pacing is a tad too rushed as well, and some of the supporting characters are not developed enough and almost incidental to the plot.Overall, while inferior to the first film 'Hotel Transylvania 2' was much better than expected. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox"
88,Hotel Transylvania 2,5,13 May 2016,Hotel Transylvania 2: An Adult Cartoon with a PG Rating,"First, I do not recommend this film for any children under 17. I cannot imagine that somebody watched this whole picture and rated it as PG unless these types of things are so commonplace in today's children's programming that the raters have quit screening things out because they cannot handle being challenged by so many big-budget film studios. As the stills below show, this picture is extremely well executed, but almost deliberately sets out to give kids that might dare to watch it nightmares.The film is full of jokes like enormous tears dropping like puddles on top of the mother in laws' head is reminiscent of Bugs Bunny Looney Tunes, with similar slapstick hits and shots that might have killed the victim in reality, but fail to cause damage in the cartoons.Fig. 7. Monstrously giant tears dropping on Linda, the groom's mother.Other jokes slide into gay porn. Here Dracula dresses as a nurse and does a seductive rear-end dance as he is fondling the newly born infant. Is it appropriate for children to watch a drag performance? Perhaps so, if we lived in a society that was gender-neutral, but this kind of comedy humiliates and pokes fun at people who might choose to wear drag because in it they feel more truly like themselves. And if we put the drag aside, why is this nurse wearing an extremely tight dress that is coming apart and shows a bit too far up Dracula's more distant leg.Fig. 8. Dracula in drag as a nurse after the birth of his grandson.Then, there are scenes that are suggestive of child pornography. A pack of young wolves eat the fur off a monster's legs. He has red underwear under this fur, as if it is his clothing. The underwear shows an outline of private parts. At least some of the wolves chew on and over the monster's groin to get the fur off. So, they're kind of giving him oral in a giant orgy. The monster isn't in pain from whatever they're doing, and only pretends to be embarrassed and attempts to cover the underwear afterwards. Considering that some young viewers might have been molested, this scene might make them feel as if molestation is normal and funny.Fig. 9. Child werewolves devouring the pants off a monster's body.Then, the kid's grand-grandpa is invited by accident to his fifth birthday party, and when he finds out that his grand-grand-son might not be a vampire, he calls in demons from hell to come and kill all of the guests and destroy the hotel his grandson has worked to build up. Once again, this is a pretty formulaic demon attack in Hollywood movies, but relatives sending demons to massacre everybody in sight is more like an R-rated, extremely violent horror film than a PG cartoon comedy for kids Fig. 10. Demons being attacked by a pack of young werewolves.That being said, and hopefully all kids having left us by now, this is a somewhat funny dark comedy for atheist, nymphomaniac adults. It is almost better than a horror gay porn because all of the characters are very crisp and have dramatic facial features and body language, more so than they would have if this wasn't an animation.However, anybody that is hoping to watch an R-rated slapstick romp will be disappointed by the periodic ""morality lessons"" as characters debate the problems that go with interracial or inter monster-human marriages. The mother, Mavis, orated by Selena Gomez, travels to her husband's California home to determine if they should move there if their son turns out to be human as opposed to a vampire, like his grandpa Dracula hopes. There, the husband's mother, Linda says, ""Oh, Transylvania, it was a fun experience. Mike was afraid he'll get disemboweled and eaten, but I told him, he was just being silly."" To this Mike replies with the formulaic rebuttal for Hollywood comedies, ""No, that was you Linda."" Linda, formulaically looks innocent, and at this point the bell rings. Linda explains as she opens the door: ""You know we have a couple of mixed families in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd invite them over. It might be nice for you guys to talk since you're thinking about moving here."" The first couple that enters is a pretty girl and her odd-looking monster husband and the pretty one recommends the move saying, ""I mean the kids get picked on a little, but it toughens them up."" The normalization of racist violence against outsiders is so normal in American schools that Sandler thought it was a joke that could be the climax of this conversation. Mavis decides after this exchange that moving to California isn't for them. Thus, there is moral preaching, but the lesson is: don't come here Back in Transylvania, Dracula attempts taking his grandson to a vampire camp, and refuses to take his grandson's outstretched hand as everybody else sings in a circle around a fire: ""Even in the sunniest weather,/ Vampires will be friends forever"" Dracula then throws his grandson off a very tall tower and rescues him a second before he would have died from the collision, supposedly as a lesson in kid safety, but somehow chillingly disturbing and depressing to watch.Title: Hotel Transylvania 2 Directed by: Genndy Tartakovsky Writer: Robert Smigel, Adam Sandler Stars: Adam Sandler (Dracula), Andy Samberg (Jonathan), Selena Gomez (Mavis) Genre: Animation; Comedy; Fantasy Rating: PG Running Time: 1 h 29 min Release: 2015"
89,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,25 April 2016,Just As Funny (Or More) Than the First,"Dracula (Adam Sandler) and his friends try to bring out the monster in his half human, half vampire grandson in order to keep Mavis from leaving the hotel.I was a bit startled early on when Mavis is pregnant, and even uses the word ""pregnant"". It seemed out of place in a children's film, even if not offensive. But maybe it was a breath of fresh air? I don't know.Anyway, this movie could have been awful, as we generally expect from sequels. But it wasn't. I think casting Nick Offerman was kind of a waste (he is hardly used), but the humor here is definitely on par with the first film, maybe even passing it. Kakie is great, and Blobby is really the stand out character here.I'm not sure what they were trying to say about the generations, with Dracula attending a dangerous summer camp and modern kids attending ridiculously safe ones. There seems to be this belief that kids today are over-protected and no longer ""free range"". I think that has been exaggerated, and really puts a negative stamp on the youth. But maybe I am reading into the movie too much."
90,Hotel Transylvania 2,5,19 March 2016,Some funny moments with a decent storyline! 5/10,"Review: This movie was a little corny and not as good as the first one but it still had its funny moments. The animation wasn't as detailed as a Pixar movie but Sony used vibrant colours and the various characters flowed pretty well. The fast moving storyline wasn't too bad and the various characters made the film quite interesting but Drac (Adam Sandler), is definitely the star of the film. Now that Drac's daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez) is married to Jonathan (Andy Samberg), they happily live together in Hotel Transylvania and a year after there marriage, Mavis becomes pregnant and gives birth to there sweet little boy, Dennis (Asher Blinkoff). Drac can't wait for his grandson to become a vampire but Mavis wants a normal life for her son, so she goes to Los Angeles with her husband to see they can live there. While there away, Drac takes his grandson through vampire training, with his close monster friends Frank, Murray, Wayne and Griffin but the whole escapade turns out to be a disaster. When they get back to Hotel Transylvania, Mavis finds out about what they were getting up to, so she threatens to leave after Dennis's birthday party. After getting a secret invitation to the party, Drac's dad turns up and he isn't happy that Dennis is half human/half vampire. His trustee right hand man takes matters into his own hands, and kidnaps Dennis so the monsters, vampires and humans join forces to try and find him. When they eventually find him, Drac's dad finally comes to terms with Dennis and he punishes his right hand man and everyone lives happily ever after. A sweet story for the whole family! Personally, I quite enjoyed the movie because there is so much going on, especially in the background of some scenes, so I'm not surprised that it made such a profit at the box office. I was expecting a bit more, after enjoying the first movie but it's still watchable and it's good to see the characters progress in this popular franchise. Enjoyable! Round-Up: Adam Sandlers movies have gone dramatically downhill but this franchise seems to have actually worked. His movies always make a profit, no matter how bad they are, and it's not often that they go straight to DVD. He had a lot of input in this movie, in terms of writing and executive producing, so a lot of the jokes and wit was supplied by him. Gendy Tartakovsky, 46, directed the movie, after directing the first film in this franchise and he also brought you the Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack and 25 episodes of Star Wars: Clone Wars. I honestly think that this movie worked because it was written by established comedians who have been in the comedy game for most of there life's. From an adult point of view, it won't go down as an all time classic but you can watch it with the little kiddies, and chuckle at a few of the crazy scenes. Budget: $80million Worldwide Gross: $470millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/family/comedies voiced by Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Keegan-Michael Key, Molly Shannon, Rob Riggle, Mel Brooks, Chris Kattan and Jon Lovitz. 5/10"
91,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,12 March 2016,Not a bad second movie,"I original wanted to give it a six, but I bumped it up to a seven for several funny scenes which still make me chuckle.It could have been better, but the script still works. There are three serious flaws in the continuity of the movie but that is why it loses three points.Your kids should love this movie and there are enough references for parents to laugh at if they pay attention. The animation is no better or worse than the previous movie. I just wish production companies would get more creative and stop naming stuff ""2"" or ""3"" when they make sequels.7/10"
92,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,4 March 2016,It's vampa time!,"Frankly, I was not thinking of writing a review for this. You know, some animated movies come and go unnoticed, so I believed it would be one of those. In fact, I did not like the first film much, that is the reason to watch it so delayedly and with a minimum expectation. Better late than never, well, I regret for viewing it so late. One of the best animation of 2015, maybe in the top 10 or 15.Well, it was a one liner, like, the daughter wants to move to the human social world thinking that might do good for her son's future. But her father plan to stop her getting away from him and the hotel. So those attempts are the rest of the movie. I liked the movie very much because it was very funny, especially the lines were and its accent, Adam Sandler nailed it.I have said millions of times that I don't know why Americans and critics hate Adam Sandler that much, I don't know about the rest of the world but I kind of like his films. The last few films like 'The Cobbler', 'Pixel', 'Men, Women & Children' and this one were so much better. It did not bring the old Sandler, but brought us a different and new Sandler on screen. He was definitely the main reason for this film's success.Don't just a book by its cover, well, here the cover is the previous installment. The first part was not a must see IMPO, but this is especially for the animated movie fans. PG rated movie, but still it might scare mildly for below 8 kids, only because of the theme. I had a great time with it and expecting it to do the same impact on you as well. And I can't predict the third will be as lucky as this one, lets wait and see.8/10"
93,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,29 February 2016,nice sequel,"Drac (Adam Sandler) is back. His daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) gets married to human Jonathan (Andy Samberg). They have a humany son Dennis. Drac is desperate for him to grow fangs before his 5th birthday. He takes him on a trip to show the ways of monsters while Johnny and Mavis are away to visit his family in California. Mavis loves Cali but Johnny secretly wishes to stay in Transylvania. Drac's trip is problematic since humanization has taken over his childhood world. Mavis invites her vampa Vlad (Mel Brooks) to Dennis' birthday party.This is a nice sequel. It's pretty much the same thing. I love invisible Griffin (David Spade) and his fake invisible girlfriend. The start is a bit rush as the movie pushes Johnny and Mavis' relationship from marriage to pregnancy to a young son. The story doesn't have a villain until the last act. However, it's all fun and Drac's dilemma is a very touching universal story."
94,Hotel Transylvania 2,9,21 January 2016,"Very good animated sequel- hilarious, nice to look at and worth watching in 3D","I saw this back in October with my grandparents in Oceanside in 3D to pass time from my parents and brother going on the beach. I thought the first one was a pretty enjoyable watch, although it had it's flaws with the story and the constant pop culture gags. When I saw it, not only is it thoroughly entertaining, but it's just as good, if not better than the first movie! The visual effects are realistic and breathtaking to see with your eyes, and I recommend watching this in 3D, because it makes the spooky locations look scarier and more life-like, and I even jumped at a few parts. The character animation has a Tex Avery feel with all it's ADHD-paced energy and expressive emotion and exaggerated slapstick. I laughed out loud enough to call this movie hilarious, and even my grandparents agreed it was really funny at times. The voice work is lively, the 3D choreography is a marvel, the visuals are energetic, the humor gets a lot of laughs and the characters are love able and easy to get along with. I have a Blu-Ray 3D player and a 3D TV, so I can be dazzled by the effects all the time(no offense to those who don't, they can still enjoy it just as much in 2D, I just believe the 3D is up there with some of the best I've seen in an animated film yet). The only flaws I have are the predictable story and annoying pop songs."
95,Hotel Transylvania 2,,15 January 2016,Extremely Funny and Highly Entertaining,"Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015) *** (out of 4)Dracula (Adam Sandler) is happy as can be when his daughter gives birth to his grandson. After a couple years of waiting for his grandson's fangs to come out, Dracula decides to teach the boy how to become a monster but his mother insists that perhaps he's more human than anything else.HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA was a cute little movie that was fun to watch once but I must admit that I didn't have the need or desire to watch it a second time. I really wasn't sure what to expect with this sequel but I was downright shocked at how good and funny it was. I watched it with my six-year-old son and I honestly think I laughed more than he did. If you're a fan of monsters and horror movies then you'll certainly enjoy this film no matter how old you are.I was really shocked at how well-written the screenplay was as the story itself is quite good and it certainly has a message to tell about people being different and being treated differently become of that. While the message is there the real success of the film is the comedy, which there are plenty of terrific laughs. I think there were countless funny scenes but some of the highlights include the blob having to ride on the outside of the car as well as the Invisible Man and his ""invisible"" date.The vocal performances were great with Sandler being in great form but so was Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Dana Carvey and even Mel Brooks pops up at the end. As you'd expect the animation is top-notch and I really loved the look of the cast, the various monsters and even the scenes in the ""normal"" California were great. HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 2 is so much better than the original and it was really one of the funniest animated films I've seen in a very long time."
96,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,13 January 2016,I enjoyed the movie,"I read many of the reviews, the negative ones just cause me to shake my head.I don't think you should ever hold one movie up to the next. Take each movie as their own being. Once you do that, you see this movie as it really is.... wonderful.To me, the second is as great as the first. I am so happy to have watched it and I will be purchasing it next to sit along side the first. I found myself laughing at least 4 or 5 times. So much so my husband came in to see what I was watching. I smiled through other parts. And all this from someone who isn't an Adam Sandler fan, but he has found a nice groove in the vampire department."
97,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,7 January 2016,"Excellent film, 10/10 easy, Favorite animated film series.","This film was phenomenal, I was very impressed with everything. The voice actors were perfect, Character development is some of the best I've seen, the was animation was stunning, and the story was at the least hilarious, clever, and touching. It is a film for all ages, it just captures your attention from beginning to end. However I personally enjoyed the first film just a bit more, primarily because I believe the first film had more emotion.None the less, this movie is one of my personal favorites. If you want to see a great movie, you should definitely see this one, and take who ever you want, it's great for everyone. I hope that you see this movie and that Sony Animation continues this film series, and continues their phenomenal work with putting a perfect combination of emotion, humor, dialogue, and action/adventure in their stories. Once again amazing film, and as long as they keep making them, I'll keep watching them."
98,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,6 January 2016,Sandler's back with a family movie that's worth your time,"First I'd like to say that it has been a long time since I've seen the first one, so I'm not going to compare the two movies. On its own the second one left me with a good impression after leaving the theater, having just a few problems, that won't really bother the viewer. The movie tells the story of Count Dracula, voiced bu Adam Sandler, but now from the posture of a grandfather, who has worries about his grandson, who might not inherit the vampire powers. In desperation he attempts to do everything he can to turn him into a vampire (except biting him), but all this without his daughter's knowledge, Mavis, voiced by Selena Gomez. His attempts turn into a total disaster that leads to a series of good laughs. All these laughs heightened with the help of supporting characters, that are very welcomed. Almost all the jokes have cross generational appeal, so not only the children can enjoy the movie. Despite all this the movie has a few minor problems that won't necessarily hurt the viewing of the movie, but some might notice them, like for instance: Jonathan's (voiced by Andy Samberg) and Mavis's story feels a bit underdeveloped and unfinished. Another problem would be a small number of pop culture references, that seemed a bit too up to date and out of the place. All in all the movie is perfect for those who want to watch something with the whole family, from toddlers to the seniors, because there is something for every generation, presenting classic familial issues that some will recognize themselves in them, when seeing the movie. Also, the movie plays as a good return for Sandler, when we take into consideration that he also co-wrote it and that the final product appeals to the whole family."
99,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,28 December 2015,Lots of fun for all the family. And many adorable love moments!,"I loved Hotel Transylvania one, and this one has only improved upon what that movie has started.From starting off as the first movie had left off, we can see how much their life has progressed over time. From meeting, to marriage, to having a young child.The movie contains many adorable scenes too, with the cute girl wolf and their son meeting up, often I found myself d'awing with the children at the movie. It's so touching how they show true love, and how much they will defend each other, no matter what happens to themselves! Nothing like seeing some good true love in a movie, that's also funny, with many jokes both parents and children will get, and also very well animated.I know many people will enjoy this movie, for a long time to come."
100,Hotel Transylvania 2,10,27 December 2015,An unique sequel!,"I loved the first installment! Hotel Transylvania was unique, amazing, entertaining and taught us a lesson, and this type of animated movies are, unfortunately, becoming more rare. This sequel was outstanding, it wasn't a let down, actually it was the opposite, still full of entertainment and the whole movie was a lesson for the problem that society is facing theses days: acceptance. This movie teach you to be yourself, not what others expect you to be, be yourself without fear, without thinking what others might say or think about you. These lessons are precious, because, to me, is what makes animated movies so amazing and special, we need more animated movies that follows this structure, entertaining and at the same time taught us life lessons. I love animated movies, and this one is no different...Don't be afraid of being yourself, accept who you are and you'll find happiness!"
101,Hotel Transylvania 2,9,27 December 2015,Entertaining but not as good as the original,"Hotel Transylvania 2 was great. It had numerous funny moments and interesting plot twists. I really enjoyed watching it. But I don't think that it was as good as the original Hotel Transylvania - but then again, sequels rarely are better than the original. That's not to say that this sequel was bad though, it just didn't quite have the effortless-majestic-hilarity-feel of the first one, if that makes sense. Anyway, overall it was a really enjoyable family movie full of laughs. It was quite engaging, there was never a boring moment. I'd definitely recommend it to those who enjoyed the original Hotel Transylvania."
102,Hotel Transylvania 2,9,25 December 2015,Best Animation Movie,"i really did enjoyed it and laugh especially with family,such an amazing movie with families and when the kid his fangs showed up and start fighting i was like what it was great hah like my own son and they did an amazing job with the story and the surprise appearance of the grand-vampa. they really planned this out, this is the first movie that ever want to watch it again and again without hesitation. really blast movie.hope you all enjoy it as much as i did!!! or at least make it a good opportunity with your children.it talk about hidden idea in it which is about family and how importance is to stick together and stand together no matter what.really educational."

104,Hotel Transylvania 2,9,17 December 2015,A big hearted and insanely funny sequel.,"I loved the first one, so i was more than happy to see a second one, and more than happy i left the theater. The film continues to make the kind of humour the shrek made so popular, pop culture mixed with century old characters and worlds, to make tons of laughs constantly. The film adds another level by once more descontruct thoughts and stereotypes about this characters, which happen to be monsters, and this is where the film makes most of its gags, which are even more than the first one.Its impossible not to laugh the entire movie, as the characters we already know come back better than ever, and new ones join in to make this a huge ensemble of top tier monsters and humans alike, as jonathan's family is now part of the gang. But no matter how funny the film is, the film shines the most with the blend of comedy and very rich drama.The film could have gone in so many clichés directions that is quite a surprise the way they went. This time they leave the hotel most of the film, which leads to grand adventures and there's even more story, with themes like home, being part of a group even if you're different, growing up, being who you are, strict family traditions vs adapting to a new world of possibilities and without limits, in the end its all about being who you are and family values. There's plenty of dance music, comedy, drama, valuable lessons, overall a great film, which can be as entertaining and funny as very big hearted and emotional. Tons of fun all the way. Know bring on the third installment."
105,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,28 November 2015,A Sequel with satisfying result,"More fun, more monsters in this sequel of a hit animated movie. The movie started where it all ended in the first part and comes with a baby in this one. The movie focuses entirely on Dennis who must become a Dracula according to his grandpa Papa Drac. Everyone puts every effort to make his fangs appear while Mavis try to relocate to city. The movie was amusing with brilliant visuals, crazy dialogues and timely comedy. Adam Sandler whose career isn't so fruitful in the last 2-3 years must be bit relaxed now because Its predictable that it will score high in Worldwide Market. It was good as the first one. I am going with 3.5/5 for this family packed animated movie."
106,Hotel Transylvania 2,8,27 November 2015,Autistic Reviewers Opinion On This movie,"Endeavoring to bring a world of monsters to the CGI-animated realm, 2012's ""Hotel Transylvania"" conjured a horror-comedy atmosphere of slapstick, scares, and overall tomfoolery. And there was plenty of bathroom humor to keep younger audiences engaged. Instead of trusting the inherent madness of the plot, director Genndy Tartakovsky elected to keep things crude, souring an otherwise promising Halloween-season adventure with classic ghouls. ""Hotel Transylvania 2"" is the inevitable sequel, and while it suffers from major structural problems, the effort has dialed down the poo-poo, pee-pee gags, trying to engage audiences with a tale of grandfatherly love, trading fart jokes for cute kids and more manic monster shenanigans.Soon after Jonathan (Andy Samberg) and Mavis's (Selena Gomez) wedding, the new bride finds herself pregnant, thrilling her father, Dracula (Adam Sandler). Ready to welcome a new generation of vampire into the family, Dracula is frustrated when the boy, Dennis (Asher Blinkoff), only favors his human side, unable to produce fangs and become a true bloodsucker. Loving his grandchild but desiring a true heir, Dracula sends Mavis and Jonathan off to California on a trip while he attempts to show Dennis the ways of monster life. Joined by Frankenstein's Monster (Kevin James), Wayne (Steve Buscemi), Griffin (David Spade), and Murray (Keegan-Michael Key), Dracula hopes to bring out Dennis's wild side through proper demonstration, ending up at his old summer camp to show the boy how hellions are truly raised. For Mavis, time away from the hotel shows her a side of life she's been missing, considering a move to keep Dennis with his own kind.This is definitely Adam Sandler's best film (and we don't even see his face). What works about this sequel is that it aims the humour at adults and at kids at the same time! Instead of giving us nonstop gags all the time, it gives us a tale of love, trust and acceptance. All of that gets interrupted when Vrad (Dracula's Dad, voiced by the legendary Mel Brooks) comes into the picture and we are really intimidated by his presence. It's not such a bad thing, but it kind of throws away what the first 60 mins style of the film was. It throws us into a very threatening, violent situation.*SPOILERS ALERT* What really ticked me off was the ending. The whole message of the film was ""No matter who you are, whether you are human, vampire or animal"" it is okay to be who you are. And the whole ending changed and was a slap in the face when Drac's grandchild turns into a bat! It was a huge slap in the face considering the fact that the whole movie was to encourage acceptance and love no matter who/what you are.But all in all, this movie provides scares, laughter, love, dramatic tension and well...family! I would have givin' it 4/5 stars, but due to the nature of the ending, I am now giving it 3.5/5 stars. Worth seeing with the whole family!"
107,Hotel Transylvania 2,7,10 November 2015,The Drac is back!,"This time around with a plot that we could have probably seen coming years ere. Okay, so this was the next reasonable thing to do, if you wished to rake in more money from a title that worked well. Genndy waves his magic wand once again, and lo we have yet another sequel to Hotel Transylvania. Also, this fictional hotel is the only place where Adam Sandler seems to be doing fine for himself. (and Madison wink intended) So we have the whole Drac gang back again in Hotel Transylvania 2, which was quite pleasant to watch. Humour was yet again quite mediocre, but at times good and would occasionally throw you into fits of laughter. There are ephemeral humorous frames punched in at some junctures like that of Family Guy's. Some were good, some were meh!The beginning part simply fast forwards to the original plot, and was quite poorly made, until of course, we meet the true hero of the flick  Dennis aka Denisovich, who is part cuteness blended perfectly in with sheer innocence. The mystery as to whether he is a vampire or a normal human being turned out to be the core of the story, and basically steered the flick forward. Obviously Genndy had little in his bag but he still managed to helm it quite beautifully. CGI is good. All the voices were great! That Adam Sandler voice would occasionally do it for you. Frankenstein, Wayne, Griffin, Murray, and Blobby complemented him and made humour even more enjoyable. Watch out for that GPS! It made me want one with that funny voice!"
108,Hotel Transylvania 2,9,30 October 2015,"Great comic action, well done. Totally enjoyable.","Quite a remarkable film. Totally enjoyable. Great laughs were had by all. hahaha. One word for this film was ""Acceptance"". In the beginning, Dracula didn't accepted Dennis being human and as such grew to him and accepted him in the end. hahaahThe plot was quite simple. heheheh. The film starts off with the wedding of Mavis(Gomez) and Jonathan(Samberg). Mavis finds out she's pregnant. And Baby Dennis(Blinkoff) is born. Mavis wants to move to California with Jonathan's HUMAN parents: Linda(Mullaly) and Mike(Offerman). However Dracula(Sandler) don't want this. What with his overprotective mode. hahaah. So Dracula wants to bring out the Vampireness outta of Dennis. As always, Dracula has a plan. hahaah. If Dennis becomes a vampire then he'll want to stay put. hehehe. However trouble further ensues when Mavis(Dracula's Daughter) reveals that she invited Vlad(Brooks) Dracula's father, to the party. Vlad is a very traditionalist ie against Humans full stop. He would even ""suck out their souls"". Vlad wants to scare out the Vampire outta Dennis. So via a teddy bear at Dennis' party, he is attempting to scare Dennis, but it don't work as Dracula actually prevents it. And so Vlad finds out his son Dracula has actually changed and attempts to change. Vlad's followers attempts to take down all humans etc., and Dennis' REAL self comes to being ie a Vampire and attacks the followers."
109,Hotel Transylvania 2,9,5 November 2015,Hilarious! Great film for children and adults,"My husband and I took our 3 year old to see this film a few weeks ago and I already want to go back and see it again. I laughed harder than most children in the audience. There were such great references to old Hollywood monster movies and TV shows that the younger children don't understand yet, but were hilarious. I love the overall concept of the storyline and it wasn't a repeat of the first film. The ability of the writers to poke fun at both a younger parent generation with the first child syndrome of over-protectiveness to the older parent generation seeing no danger because ""that's how I learned"" was spot on. I highly recommend this film to both young children and parents."
