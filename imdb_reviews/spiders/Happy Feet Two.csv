0,Happy Feet Two,7,27 May 2012,Really enjoyable,"First of all I want to say this, I really like animation films and I actually liked this more than the first Happy Feet. The characters felt more developed and they went through a more interesting journey. This film aims to tell to children not to lie and how important the friendship is. However I have been astonished when I have seen rude comments on Happy Feet 2. I think people are being too harsh on this movie. Some critics refused to look deeper because this is not their usual type of child animation film. I am actually shocked while reading some of the scathing reviews. Also, I think people are being too hypercritical because the first Happy Feet won the Oscar. I loved this movie and I found it far superior to Rango, Gnomeo & Juliet and Cars 2. The animation was amazing. In my opinion, it has the best production values and cinematography of any animated film of 2011, I have watched lately. The story is in-depth, layered, complex and much more meaningful than the first Happy Feet. Also, there are significant themes and messages about community, teamwork, bravery, overcoming obstacles and environmentalism. I laughed, cried and felt such empathy for these penguins because this movie has a lot of soul and heart."
1,Happy Feet Two,4,28 January 2012,"Pretty, but all over the place","I watched this today with two of my younger sisters, one of whom regarded the first movie as her ""favorite movie ever"" (before Kung Fu Panda came out) and was really excited for this sequel. As soon as the credits rolled, she commented ""That was... off.""(Spoilers! Spoilers! Spoilers!) First of all I'd say that the visuals were amazing as before, as well as the music and choreography. But the plot... it reminded me of how I used to put my iPod on shuffle and make up stories to go with it. A whole musical number just to calm upset Erik down? A bunch of elephant seals singing while stampeding? I was generally surprised and not sure I should be humored or facepalming at the inclusion of ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" and ""Dragostei Din Tei."" I mean did I really have to get rickrolled by krill?Oh and the krill. I kinda sorta liked the idea, but their almost pointless side-story had me rolling my eyes. The audience we were with seemed to like them, though, and laughed every time they appeared. So I guess YMMV.There were WAY too many accents and half the script was lost on me as I tried to process what each person was saying, having to quickly switch from American to Spanish to Swedish (Romanian?) to Indian, etc.The environmental message was even more heavy-handed this time (tufted puffins apparently all killed off, oils spills, global warming, etc.) I agree we should be concerned with these, but the constant shoving of it in your face makes you numb to the idea. This is coming from an environmentalist.That said, there were a bunch of things that bothered me that PROBABLY wouldn't bother most people. Like why there were African Black-footed Penguins (Africa) and Little Blue Penguins (Australia and New Zealand) living with the Adeles? Or why Mumble is still fuzzy after having almost lost all his down in the first movie. Or why Eric has all of the same markings as his father and is the ONLY blue-eyed penguin aside from his father. Is he retarded too? Did they just run out of character design ideas?All of this, plus the plot not really picking up until about a third of the way through the movie, bothered me... but it was kinda okay. Again, the visuals were great and I very much enjoyed the music. The penguins and other animals were fun to watch and for the most part realistic. I was dancing along to the big dance numbers and thought the reveal of Erik's talent was awesome (even if it sounded like an opera singer inhaling helium).So, sure, if you want something energetic and cute to sit your kids down in front of, be my guest. I might even watch it again, if I can get around the dead plot and nature issues. It's fun and pretty to look at. Just shows what a superficial, visual race we are."
2,Happy Feet Two,7,8 November 2011,Something refreshing and very nice,"I just watched this movie at a close preview in TIFF, Toronto. I really like it, for it brings a fresh wave with it's story, characters and overall look. A lot of animation movies nowadays share quite a similar way of storytelling, and that's where Happy Feet 2 stands out from the crowd. Characters of Matt Damon and Brad Pitt worked out really well. Graphics and effects look really awesome. George Miller commented on the amount and complexity of those effects by saying that their render farms almost crashed in the process. Also I'd like to comment on 3D part of the movie, because it does really work out here, looks beautiful with 3d glasses on - gives real depth, really amazing experience. And I can't say the same for a lot of 3D movies that are out there. I would definitely recommend this movie, for Happy Feet 2 will be interesting for both children and adults."
3,Happy Feet Two,,18 November 2011,A Krilly good film,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film and it did not disappoint. Although Happy Feet Two was not as good as its Oscar-winning predecessor, there were still plenty of toe-tapping moments. I liked the fact that the songs were recognizable. I am sure that L. L. Cool J is just tickled pink that they included his ""Mama Said Knock You Out"". In this film Mumble (Elijah Wood) is all grown up and learning how to be a better father to his son Erik (Ava Acres). Erik was just the cutest little thing and he pulls at your heart-strings right from the beginning. The main story line was a good one, but I think that I found the story between Bill the Krill (Matt Damon) and Will the Krill (Brad Pitt) even more entertaining. Those two had their own thing happening. I liked the way that the writer (George Miller) had two stories going on at the same time and the fact that they blended together in the end was excellent. I think that you have to have a lot going on to keep the attention of kids these days. I did not see this film in 3D, but you could tell by some of the scenes that the price of a 3D ticket might have been worth it for this film. The animation in this film was simply stunning. Animation has come a long way since Casper the Friendly ghost (I'm dating myself, huh?) Anyway, it was great. It was also refreshing to see the development of numerous female characters in this film such as Gloria (Pink) and Carmen (Sofia Vergara). I have to give props to the ladies. Robin William's character, Ramon had me cracking up throughout the film. It is not surprising that Robin really knows how to make his characters stand out since he has done numerous voice projects in the past (Genie in the Aladdin films, Dr. Know in A.I. and Fender in Robots). This film contains numerous life-lessons that I think that the target audience will understand (one person can make a difference, keep your promises, don't run away from home, etc.). If you enjoyed the first Happy Feet, then you will also enjoy this one (just not as much). Anyway, I say put on your dancing shoes, shake a tail feather and go out and see this film. I am giving this film a green light."
4,Happy Feet Two,6,23 November 2011,Extravagant,"Happy Feet is definitely one of those films that doesn't need a sequel but it has a purpose to give us an environmental message and that message became the main plot of this film. But for some reason, it's unnecessary. Extraneous characters like the Krills. There's nothing much to do with this. Just a lot of unnecessary things scattered throughout. The visuals are largely stunning and still has its powerful tone but even with those things, it still falls short.The first Happy Feet movie sets with a powerful tone and an absurd but interesting premise. That was acceptable as a penguin movie. Happy Feet 2 has its similarity with the first one by the father-son relationship. The rest is all about the crisis of the climate change but unnecessary things are happening especially with the two Krills, Will and Bill. They appear like Scrat from the Ice Age series. They are funny though but again, unnecessary.The film itself is also unnecessary. The problem of Mumble's tap dancing was already solved. They lived happily ever after in Antarctica since the ""aliens"" moderated their fishing. The climate change is a really good idea. But after the movie, it feels like it's just another sequel. Well, the movie never fails to its cast. Elijah Wood and Robin Williams did the same thing in the first movie but still good in this sequel. The newbies, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are both fun even though they are playing the most extraneous characters of the film. Pink and Common are good replacements. What happened to Fat Joe? And the last but never the least is Hank Azaria who nearly steals the show.The movie gives some nostalgia and powerful tone from the first movie but it doesn't help at all but the visuals are really stunningly beautiful. Keeps the film large and worth it to the cinema and 3D. Realistic textures to make it look like it's Animal Planet but the elephant seals looks cartoony in some part but it's still good to look at. The songs are decent.There are only two reasons why this exists. Environmental Propaganda and money. It's the 21st Century of Hollywood and they are somewhat running out of ideas. With all of their technology and talented filmmakers, they can make as many unnecessary sequels as they want. The Environmental Message is stuck in the plot but there is nothing wrong with that. Happy Feet 2 is not a bad movie. It's just unnecessary."
5,Happy Feet Two,5,12 November 2011,Every step counts.,"Mumble, The Master of Tap, has a problem because his tiny son, Erik, is choreo-phobic. Reluctant to dance, Erik runs away and encounters The Mighty Sven: a penguin who can fly! Mumble has no hope of competing with this charismatic new role model. But things get worse when the world is shaken by powerful forces. Erik learns of his father's ""guts and grit"" as Mumble brings together the penguin nations and all manner of fabulous creatures-from tiny Krill to giant Elephant Seals, to put things right. -- (C) Warner BrosI thought HAPPY FEET was pretty great. The film was foot-tapping fun and the dark turn it took in the third act, while unexpected, made it edgy and different for me. When a sequel was announced, I thought it seemed unnecessary. How far can you really stretch the premise of penguins who can dance and sing? Apparently, not that far. After viewing the sequel, it very much does seem unnecessary and wholly forgettable within ten minutes after you walk out of the theater, which is disappointing to say the least. Other than this, the main problem with HAPPY FEET 2 is that there aren't that many good musical numbers as compared to the first one. Most of them are pretty mediocre. However, there are probably around three that range from good to great, one of which uses the song ""Under Pressure,"" which is easily the best number in the entire film.Another problem I had was the dark tone of the film. It's a bit TOO dark, if you ask me. You see the younger penguin characters constantly be put in danger which made the film very uncomfortable to watch, and what these characters go through in the film would probably traumatize them for life. The film also suffers from messy storytelling. For example, the subplot with the shrimp characters (voiced by Matt Damon and Brad Pitt) seems to come from nowhere and is out of place from the rest of the film. It also doesn't help that the characters are so damn annoying. As for the 3D, it's put to good use in some places but, overall, it's really unnecessary. The one good thing I can say about the film is the look of it, which is very beautiful. I also liked Pink a lot, who gives a boost for all the musical numbers she sings in, along with Robin Williams, who has a few great jokes up his sleeves.Overall, HAPPY FEET 2 is a disappointment considering that I am a fan of the first film. Director George Miller doesn't seem to have his heart in the right place for this sequel compared to the first film. However, the film is slightly better then CARS 2 if that says anything."
6,Happy Feet Two,10,18 November 2011,Happy Feet 2 Review,"Happy Feet 2 is amazing. As a 12 year-old, I suppose I haven't watched even a total of 30 movies or such to rate this as 10 but in my opinion, Happy Feet 2 is almost as good as the first. It contains the hilarity and also amazing songs, similar to Happy Feet 1. I watched this movie with about 19 of my classmates and two of my teachers as a farewell on our graduation from school. When Erik started singing to the elephant seal, the scene itself was so sad I couldn't help but start crying. And I love those two krill, Bill and Will if I'm not mistaken...One asked the other of they could have children and the other replied that they were both males. Hilarious! My favourite quote ""We're doomed and they're dancing. Unbelievable!"" I recommend this movie to others because I enjoyed, became emotional and had a lot of fun!"
7,Happy Feet Two,,21 November 2011,Chix Chat on Film review: Mumble is still heroic and he's a dad.,"It is very difficult to make an entertaining movie that has a lesson in the consequences of climate change on the Antarctic wildlife, just as it is always hard to live up to the original when you're a sequel. This sequel made the lesson entertaining but the film did not live up to the original. I really enjoyed the original and watched it many times over, I'm not so sure I would do the same with Two. The lesson in Happy Feet was clear cut and the scandalous humans did try to resolve the atrocity of depleting the penguins food source, but in Happy Feet Two nothing was really clear except that the polar icecaps are melting and now the Emperor penguins fully accept song and dance. Mumble (Elijah Wood) and Gloria (P!nk) now have had an egg of their own, and are now parents to Erik (Ava Acres). Mumble is challenged to be a good father and Erik is on a path of self discovery. The role of Gloria is filled nicely, her singing prowess made the opening Rhythm Nation production amazing, it was actually the most outstanding compilation in the entire film and would have been more fitting as the grand finale song. I unlike Catt was not thrilled by the krill, I have yet to figure out what the krill was the point of the krill storyline with Bill the Krill (Matt Damon) and Will the Krill (Brad Pitt) other than to add some big names to the film since Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) and Memphis (Hugh Jackman) did not reprise their roles. I really liked what was happening with Ramon (Robin Williams) in this story, with the whole hatin' on The Mighty Sven (Hank Azaria) while pursuing Carmen (Sofia Vergara), the chase could have been expanded in place of the krill story filler. The movie just seemed to have a number of encounters loosely strung together with no outstanding purpose of it all, unlike the original with the fact that different can be the one thing that saves everybody. Maybe the message of this film was if humans venture to aid the wildlife and we don't succeed, they'll figure out a resolution to their problem themselves. Or when everyone works together to deal with a problem no matter how big or how small you are you can overcome any obstacle. Or maybe I just didn't get the point, which is why this film gets an amber light."
8,Happy Feet Two,10,7 December 2011,Beautiful animation and an enjoyable film,"I really enjoyed Happy Feet Two. The animation is truly amazing, akin to that of avatar if not better. I saw it in 3D which I highly recommend. The scenes with the Krill swarm are truly mesmerising. I found the story a little slow to start off with but once I got into it I really enjoyed it. In particular I found the Will and Bill characters (Damon and Pitt) enjoyable. It was probably not as funny as its predecessor but still makes for an enjoyable movie. I also enjoyed the 80s rock ballads and there is some great singing from Pink. I can't understand why the critics have been so harsh on this film I really enjoyed it and it is worth seeing for the animation alone. Well worth while for the whole family."
9,Happy Feet Two,2,20 November 2011,If I were a kid,"The only thing I liked about the movie was the song and a bit of animation. Rest of it....see to believe it.What I meant was, don't bother. The first movie as better in many ways. Just by looking at the trailer, I had my mind made up not to watch it..not even for free. But there are somebody in your family members who will go against your will and there will be nothing you can do. Thus, I went. Total waste of everything. This movie is not for adults. period. There is tiny story, very little. It felt like it was musical animation with worse dialogs ever. The theme was the same as the first one. No food, child with no talent...... and finally the very child helps other survive."
10,Happy Feet Two,1,6 February 2012,A tribute to the decline of creativity in the movie industry.,"Spoiler Alert -I took my little brother to see this movie in the theater with high hopes, we were both gravely disappointed, he was very sad we didn't go see something else.He fell asleep halfway through, but awoke with grunts of frustration each time the penguins would break into song. The movie really pushed our buttons, and was over all very annoying.I left the theater at the anti climactic ending where they all start singing ""Under Pressure,"" what a terrible movie, I remember the days when movies came with their own songs, like The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.Over all, not worth the money."
11,Happy Feet Two,4,31 January 2012,Ouch...,"The penguins' and the people's feet and vocal cords are starting to hurt - because they tried to tap dance and sing through a movie that had exhausted its potential. The first film told us everything we needed to know about a such a wonderful world. Now unfortunately, this sequel has become so ""been there done that"", it should be changed to ""Unhappy Feet 2""The worst parts: Mumble's son Erik can't sing or dance, but suddenly he sings at the precise moment where a situation seems impossible, and it becomes suddenly possible again. Ramone and Lovelace's characters were made smaller so a new character with no depth could come in action. The specially made songs for the movie (Bridge of Light) made little sense with the movie, despite how beautiful they were. And finally, the whole plot about the unavailability of the fish had already been done before.Overall, I was very disappointed after waiting so long to see the sequel, and finding out that this was all they came up with. Some songs were good, especially Under Pressure and Dragostea Din Tei, but nothing in the movie captured the magic of the first one."
12,Happy Feet Two,4,20 April 2012,Does the original Happy Feet a huge disservice by sharing the name,"Promoting responsibility to children is a great idea, however personification of penguins by having them talk while watching real footage of people eating chicken is a subliminal mind-game. The connection smooths the black and white into a grayish-sick.The subject of the movie is far too deep for the young to understand, and too immature for the adults to enjoy; this movie sits on neither side of the fence, but sort of has a post up the middle! (Unpleasant) The voices and star's voices of Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Pink, etc. is what sold me. The cute pictures of penguins sold my kids, who lost interest after the third song... not at all the first Happy Feet. :( The producers need to do a serious sit-and-think before dragging the incredible first picture through another slaughter by creating a third."
13,Happy Feet Two,,17 November 2011,Happy Feet 2 - Great Family Movie Displaying Happiness and Friendship,"I love this movie. It's about Mumble (Elijah Wood) and Gloria's (Pink) baby penguin named Erik (Ava Acres) who wanders off from all the other penguins. His father, Mumble tries to find him and while he is gone a big iceberg blocks the penguins from going anywhere. Anthony's video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_2LiIaHRbYMy favorite characters are Mumble, Erik and two krill named Will and Bill (Brad Pitt & Matt Damon). I like Mumble because he is really funny and he sometimes gets mad at Erik. I like Erik because he tries to get his father to take more chances and he is almost always happy. I like the two krill because they show how friendships take work. They split up in the movie, get lost and then find each other again and make a stronger friendship.My favorite part of this movie is when Will and Bill start tapping on the ice from underneath - kind of like how Mumble taps on the ice from above. Then, a whole bunch of other krill join in and they light up the ice with all of their tapping. I think this is really cool because it is neat to see all the lights and how they actually do that.The animation and special effects in this movie are really cool. When the krill light up the sea, that is really cool. When some of the ice goes tumbling down the effects of that are really neat. The animation in this movie is awesome. The penguins look very real and they do a good job at making them talk.I recommend this movie for ages two and up. This movie does have a few scary parts that might be frightening for kids younger than two. For example, when one of the elephant seals falls into a big hole his kids get really scared because they think he might get stuck down there forever. That part made me a little nervous. This is a great family movie that shows happiness and friendship. Go out and see this movie when it comes out in theaters on November 18th.Reviewed by Anthony Aranda, age 9, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic"
14,Happy Feet Two,,16 November 2011,A happy kids' film,"Happy Feet Two has all the allegorical animation requirements in one amusing story about a little penguin's growth to self-knowledge and courage, a family that fights for each other, and an entire village of empire penguins determined to survive in the face of a daunting environmental catastrophe.And don't forget the dancing penguin routines, now a part of our cultural memory because who would have ever thought such a conceit would work? In the case of this film, the dancing is central to the survival of the colony, all of which is just metaphor for having imagination and invincible spirit to overcome the odds.The chances for Happy Feet Two being sappy and repetitive were significant, but its ebullient spirit, gifted voices like Robin Williams,' and a creative plot make the penguins an unlikely symbol of intrepid imagination. Anyway, when I hid in a trench in New Zealand to see the little lovelies trundle home as they always do at the same time each day, I was hooked to see an animation renewing our cultural romance with penguins and the beast fable itself."
15,Happy Feet Two,1,4 December 2011,The Single Most Boring Movie I've Ever Seen,"When I saw the trailer for Happy Feet Two, I was surprised to see that it didn't contain any real plot details, and just had a lot of singing penguins. I figured that it was just a teaser trailer, and that the actual movie was sure to be different. It wasn't. When I went to see the movie in theaters, (I walked out of Jack and Jill, and decided to settle with this.) I wondered how the creators were going to make a sequel to Happy Feet work. The answer is simple: They didn't. The first forty minutes or so serves as exposition. Just characters travelling from place to place, meeting new people, then moving on. Despite the dozens of characters that are introduced, only one of them has actual problems: Mumble's son, Eric. He has legitimate problems (confidence issues or something) but the problem is that once Eric's shortcoming's are introduced, they fade into the background and are never brought up again. Meanwhile, two krill break off from their swarm, and spew existentialist blather until they have a lover's spat, split up, then get back together again after a whole lot of screaming and being thrown around by characters who are actually part of the story. That covers the first forty minutes. After that, a huge chunk of ice breaks off of a glacier for no reason addressed on camera, and traps the penguin colony. Maybe it would have been more interesting if all the speaking character's weren't all outside the confinement. But whatever. Some humans show up to dig the penguins out, but a snow storm makes them leave, rendering the last ten minutes of watching them work pointless. Then the penguins try to fly out, thanks to the advice of what is obviously a PUFFIN, which everybody thinks is a penguin. The flying doesn't work, since penguins can't fly no matter how hard they believe in themselves and flap their wings, so in despair, Mumble starts tap dancing, something that was ignored for an entire hour of movie. The rest of the penguins start dancing too, and more and more different species show up to dance the penguins out of their entrapment. This is essentially a half hour long mash-up of songs that were good before penguins started trying to sing them in the wrong octave with an orchestra backing them up. This is interspersed with a horrid solo by Eric. I'm not sure how they achieved their end result, but it sounded like they chipmunked an adult, since Eric's voice sounded bizarre and metallic, and had way too much vibrato for a little kid.The pros: Fantastic animation. I did not see it in 3d, but it strikes me as something that would have looked pretty good in it.The cons"" Everything else. I was bored almost the entire time. The only enjoyment I got out of the experience was seeing the trailer for the Lorax, and laughing about how The Lorax sounded like Frank from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.To recap, do not see this movie. It's dumb, it's pointless, and it's devoid of fun. It's the single most boring movie I've ever sat through."
16,Happy Feet Two,,2 December 2011,What a mess!,"Happy Feet Two is a baffling experience. Here is a movie has enough story elements for nine movies and enough environmental messages to fill a year's-worth of evening news reports. We get messages about the importance of family and friends; messages about the environment; messages about respecting each other; messages about helping each other. We get messages about pitching in, and some tired nonsense about believing in yourself and celebrating out differences. It is also overstuffed with too many characters, which wouldn't be a problem except that nearly all of the characters are penguins who, for the most part, all look alike. That's not good when you have a canvas that is packed with thousands and thousands of them.Let me start with the singing and dancing. The movie opens with a musical medley that includes a cover of Janet Jackson's ""Rhythm Nation"" while thousands of Emperor penguins keep in step and sing in unison. Mixed into the medley is some gospel, some pop music and some hip hop. The basic questions are thus: Why are they singing? Who are they singing to? How much time do they take out of their furious search for food to work on their dance routine? These are the same questions that perplexed me about 2006's Happy Feet. That movie didn't answer my questions and neither does this one.Having revisited Luc Jacquet's wonderful documentary March of the Penguins recently, I have come to fully understand what a difficult and perilous existence the Emperor penguin lives. Think of this: Mother penguin lays an egg that the father penguin has to keep warm while Mother takes a perilous journey across the ice, dodging hungry sea lions in order to get food to bring back home. Papa takes care of the egg and sometimes the temperature drops and the baby inside the egg freezes to death. Added to that is the fact that papa has no idea if mama will ever return home. Based on that set of problems, I would think that keeping their choreography straight might not be on their short list of priorities. If they have to sing, maybe a song like ""Food, Glorious Food"" might seem more appropriate. Even ""Heat Wave"" would do.The story is pretty thin. It involves the penguin Mumbles (voiced by Elijah Wood), the subject of the previous picture, who is now grown up and has a son. His son is named Erik and, like his old man, doesn't have much rhythm which I guess is kind of a problem when you're one of thousands of penguins who need to keep in step, after all, you don't want to ruin the dance routines for whomever might be watching. Erik and a few outcasts travel away from his penguin brothers to find their identity. Out in the ice, they discover another colony of penguins led by a charismatic Swedish Puffin named Sven (voiced by Hank Azaria) whom they all assume is a flying penguin. Sven acts as kind of motivational speaker, especially when the penguins have trouble finding a mate. Actually, Sven is quite creepy. Azaria is a wonderful talent but the character has a kind of creepy clown look about him, and his presence is seen early and often. A little of him goes a long way.While he's gone - you'll love this - his brother and sister penguins become trapped when the shifting glaciers wall them in, leaving them unable to get out to get food. That leads to scenes a mother, father and child penguins teeming and panicking, fearing that they are going to die. Nice, huh? That leads to Mumble, Erik and friends having the join forces with the a group of Elephant Seals (yes, Elephant Seals) to them get their brothers and sisters out of this predicament. Yeah, uh huh. Okay.Added into this milieu is a side-plot involving two krill named Will (Brad Pitt) and Bill (Matt Damon) who are existentialists and also curious to know what lies outside their swarm. They want to venture outside and figure out what lies out in the world just for them. The realization that they are merely food for hungry whales doesn't fill them with joy. What is really perplexing about these two characters - beside the fact that they sing songs that range from Wang Chung to Rick Astley - is their agenda. There's some meager minor hint that they might be a couple, but you're left to wonder why the movie even makes that suggestion. Like Sven, they are creatures outside their element, and also like Sven, a little of them goes a long way.The krill at least distinguish themselves. The penguins, not so much. It is hard to tell one from another, except one that is sporting a sweater. Penguins have tiny eyes and their mouths are beaks so they can't express much there. Their squat bodies aren't exactly able to move around much to accelerate an action scene. They waddle and trying to make them do anything more than that is awkward and weird.The basic message is this: Happy Feet Two is a mess. It can't find a tone, nor a purpose. It meanders from one thing to the next, from one environmental message to the next without much structure or narrative. When the penguins sing, the musical numbers are grating. When they talk, they speak in a kind of PSA format about the environment and friendships and celebrating their differences. What perplexed me is that this is a movie mostly aimed at children, but what are they to take away from this? There are so many messages and so much cacophony thrown at them so thick and fast, why are they going to get from this? It sucks to be a penguin, that's what I got from it. Then again, I got that from March of the Penguins, and I didn't have to listen to Wang Chung to get there."
17,Happy Feet Two,1,5 December 2011,It's only for 5 yrs and below,"The first thing that got my attention was why mumble was somehow un- aged. At the end of happy feet his fluff had gone up to his neck cause you could see the yellow on his chest a bit and now his fluff is back down to his waist!!! surely his fluff would've all been gone by now!! I get that mumble was a little bit slower than everybody else, It was what helped ostracize him aside from his lack of vocal ability and preference for dance, but that doesn't mean that he was a complete abnormality. It also seemed creepy that mumble had a son looking the way he was in the movie. It's like having your older brother as your own father when he eff'ed your mom before he hit puberty. It's very disturbing!Another thing is that the story wasn't really that interesting and feels unconnected. There were funny and slightly interesting bits here and there but they were really not enough to save this one. I actually fell asleep for at least 5 mins in the middle of this movie.We already know that this is a story about singing and dancing penguins but unlike the first one, here they just find every excuse to break into song. It's like every time the writers' would run out of things to write they decide to put in a song or two just to make the movie longer. We also get that Mumble's son would have struggled with his talents just like his father but seriously, OPERA??? OMG!!! When his son started singing, the creepiness level went through the roof for me. I covered my ears as tight as I can and ""mumbled"" till he finished singing.I could go all day long about how bad this film is but I think I've said enough.So, unless you have to take your 5 yr old kid to see this movie... DON'T BOTHER WASTING YOUR TIME... I PROMISE YOU YOU'LL REGRET IT!"
18,Happy Feet Two,10,4 December 2011,From a 5 year old.,"This review is from my 5 year old daughter Cora. We read the reviews here and she wanted to enter her own review. So without further ado....The movie is very very funny. I rate it 10 stars. My favorite part is the dancing baby penguins. They were so cute when they came out with snow all over them and they shook it off. I also thought it was funny when a bird thought he was going to get cooked because he saw one men and two men cooking. He finally gets away and thinks he is a penguin that can fly, but he is really a bird. The penguin thinks he can fly because he believes the bird is a penguin and the bird is flying. I like that the mother penguin and baby penguin had a special signal to call each other."
19,Happy Feet Two,5,19 November 2011,"Well, the penguins are back, for better or for worse...","Somewhere around the 30 minute mark of Happy Feet Two, there's a scene where Gloria, played by Alecia ""Pink"" Moore in lieu of the late Brittany Murphy, sings to her scared baby penguin named Erik a song called ""Bridge of Light"", while he appears trapped on an upper glacier. The lyrics seem to be a hippie anthem about how all you need is love, and how if the world had everyone love each other, and... Well, that, the world wouldn't be a so bad place, like, ya know? At that point, their peace and love causes the northern lights to start. This is where the first thing that popped up in my mind was ""people who thought the first movie was too preachy should best steer clear of THIS.""It only seemed possible from the success of the first movie that a sequel would be released. I mean, after all, despite the fact that it left audiences divided, it became popular and made tons of bucks at the box office. And since Brittany Murphy died, things further went to hell for this sequel. Despite all that... It managed to get made and released... And not much else. I'll admit I loved the first movie. I can understand why it would divide audiences- not everyone favours a global warming message, but I liked it, it had great music, it was super cute, and I absolutely loved it.I was in favour of the inevitable sequel that followed. Tonight I finally saw the sequel... And, it was a mess.If anything, the best way to describe this movie would be rushed. I still find it hard to believe that this movie took 5 years to make... This kind of ""plot"" could have been scraped up in a week, not even, for me. I feel as if they probably felt rushed to find a Brittany Murphy replacement and go from there, to rush the film out. However, there is a fair amount to love in this film. Obviously, I did give the movie a 5/10, so there's a lot to love, right? For one, the charming look is still here. The look has vastly improved from the first movie evidently. The animation looks far better, and the IMAX 3D complimented the graphics perfectly. Every single flake of snow, hair, drop of water can be seen, it's absolutely amazing. In addition, the voice work is admirable too- Matt Damon and Brad Pitt as the skrill, Robin Williams as Lovelace, Hank Azaria as Sven (probably the highlight of the film), Elijah Wood as Mumble, etc. There are a lot of funny moments in the film too, I won't lie. I loved the brief shout outs to the first movie, as well as the ""Loney Goatherd"" yodel to scare the birds away. I will also admit, I LOVED Under Pressure, it was AMAZING. and how it was in tune to the snow falling, was even greater.However, unfortunately it isn't enough to make up for... Um... The rest of this movie.No memorable numbers except for Under Pressure. The first movie had Boogie Wonderland and Somebody to Love. Those were awesome! And all the worse is that it starts off so well with the medley. It makes you believe the film will be just as good as the first. Too bad the film scraps that promise right away.What was the plot?! The movie can't even decide what it was about, which is even bad in the first 40 minutes. At first you think it's going to be a story along the same lines of the first movie, about a youngling in search of his inner dance. Then all of a sudden... It's about global warming... Oh, wait, we must introduce Sven, the flying penguin! Oh, now were trapped in their home land! And the skrill! Who were they and why were they in the movie?! They had no point at all!!!...which marks the perfect point to segue into the film's biggest issue: the movie moves at such a glacial pace (no pun intended), since 3/4 of the film are set in the homeland. This made the movie feel longer than it was, for reasons I cannot put my finger on. I mean, global warming is an issue that is important to be touched upon. However, the film just stays there, and it doesn't work. It ruins what could been a great film. In short, I wish I could love this movie. But... There's too much of too little. Whereas the first movie was a marvel in terms of everything, this film is cute and... cute. I love cute things. I need more than just cute, though. I need enjoyability to go with it. And while this film isn't bad at all, I can't recommend it, for reasons stated above.OVERALL: 5/10THE GOOD: Gorgeously rendered and animated, Happy Feet Two stays cute and delivers on the dancing and cuteness.THE BAD: Cuteness can't make up for its indecisive screenplay, lack of memorable numbers and characters void of emotional connectability."
20,Happy Feet Two,,20 November 2011,Save your money!!,"I went to see this movie with my niece. She's seven, and SHE didn't even like it! Happy Feet 2 drags on for one hour and 40 very long minutes. The plot, and I use that term loosely, is all the penguins at Emperorland become trapped when a glacier slams into their home and traps them. Apparently, glaciers move at lightning fast speed, and none of the penguins were able to see it coming. It's then up to Mumble, Eric, and Eric's two sidekicks to save the day...through dancing of course! Obtaining help from some elephant seals and some other penguins, they all dance enough to dislodge a large section of ice. Then, all the penguins can walk out. Yay! Now they can go seek revenge on all those rotten humans that abandoned them when the blizzard rolled in. Maybe that can be Happy Feet 3 - The Revenge. (Hey, it worked for Jaws...oh, wait...) Here's the main problem with the movie...the problem of the penguins being trapped could have been solved in approximately one minute. Will the Krill falls through a hole in the ice while the penguins are dancing, and the group of krill decide to live underneath that section of ice, because they are safe there. Hmmm...the krill fell through a small hole in the ice. See where I'm going here?? The penguins could have just used their beaks to pick through the ice to make a hole, and then just swim to safety. There ya go. Movie over in five minutes. I also wanted to jab two q-tips in my ears to make myself deaf when Mumble's son is singing to convince the elephant seal to help rescue the penguins. Cheesy isn't a strong enough word...Velveetaey works better. Please save your money."
21,Happy Feet Two,1,11 April 2012,"OK, I get it ... the ice caps are melting.","Not much different from the first. It had penguins. All kinds of penguins. They all danced around and sang a bunch of hit singles. Only this time there is the whole Global Warming undertone.This would be a pretty good film for kids though. Like a two year old or something. You know, if you're the kind of parent that just plops your kid down in front of a TV so they can be babysat by flickering colors and songs.And one of the penguins falls face first in a hole and poops all over the place. Then I was all like ""Did that just happen?"" Trust me, I've seen a penguin poop at Sea World. They were strangely accurate.I hope I didn't ruin the movie for you."
22,Happy Feet Two,5,18 November 2011,Cute is about the only appropriate way to describe it,"There's little rhyme or reason to anything in the ""Happy Feet"" universe. If it sings, dances, looks cute and enhances ethnic diversity, it flies. Except penguins of course  penguins can't fly, everyone knows that. But that doesn't mean they can't creatively problem solve through self-determination, tap-dancing and passionate arias. Okay, so nothing makes sense about ""Happy Feet Two,"" but only a cold soul needs rationalization for adorable singing penguins.Five years after the original, ""Happy Feet Two"" requires no previous knowledge of the original, though it couldn't hurt to be aware that it features penguins apt to break out into any song popular in 2008 or earlier. Mumble (Elijah Wood) has grown up and now has his own social outcast son with no sense of rhythm, Erik (Ava Acres). After the opening dance number ends in embarrassment, Erik and friends Bo and Atticus leave their emperor penguin tribe and head to the tribe of Latino penguins with the silly Ramon (Robin Williams). There they discover Sven (Hank Azaria), the famous flying penguin. When Mumble finds the runaways, they head back home to discover a giant iceberg has trapped their friends and family, effectively cutting off their food supply.The movie's main subplot, the story of two krill who leave their swarm voiced by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, far and away steals the spotlight. The two are hilarious and the writing insanely witty as Will (Pitt) suffers an existential crisis when he realizes he's one of a ""krillion"" bottom- feeders in a huge ocean. He then drags his reluctant friend Bill (Damon) on a quest to defy the food chain. If only the rest of the script could be as clever and snappy rather than leaning on Williams for laughs.As those who've seen the original might remember, real live-action humans are once again involved in this film. These ""aliens,"" as the penguins call them, had ""captured"" Sven and head honcho penguin Lovelace on an oil rig and Lovelace sings some boisterous recitative as to how they escaped. Later on, Lovelace gets the attention of a fishing boat and some human dude comes out to play an electric guitar solo to ""We Are the Champions."" Lovelace's ""plan"" works, as the humans try and rescue the penguins, but they abandon them when a blizzard roles through. Once again, ""humans suck and continuously destroy the natural order of things"" remains part of director/creator George Miller's message.It would be safe to say after two ""Happy Feet"" movies that Miller has a hippie liberal quasi- socialist agenda. After Sven proves he's not what he seems and the flight-determined penguins back off their dream of the impossible, especially poor little Erik, it turns out that the only way they can save these trapped penguins is to generate some karma and solicit the help of other penguin tribes, then all the other species of Antarctica, namely elephant seals, must give of themselves a bit to benefit the whole continent. Meanwhile, it's clear that global warming is the real cause of the problems, but the film never comes out and says it. Brainwashing? Quite possibly.The musical numbers in the film range from fun and catchy to random chaos and so does their positioning within the film. During the final act, the penguins and others manage to sing techno hit ""Dragostea Din Tei,"" as well as ""Rawhide"" and finally ""Under Pressure."" It's like a non-cohesive ""Glee"" episode with penguins. Mix the humans into some of the numbers and you might regret not bringing your hallucinogens to the theater.Visually, the film retains the original's distinctive style of realism with cartoonish features, but it's not nearly as breathtaking as it was back in 2006 as most studios have caught up. Some of the ocean sequences might have been interesting to see in 3D just to see if its that layered depth-of-field kind of 3D and not just the playing to the audience 3D (which there's plenty of).Miller, the writers and the animation team created knew full well that regardless of whether they had an even remotely interesting story, they could cover up just about anything with cute baby animals and singing/dancing. Sadly, naturally or however you feel about it, they're right. The cuteness can't completely disguise the lack of good storytelling, but it does act as a great equalizer. If you find yourself unable to articulate this feathery exercise in musical chairs to others, Warner Bros. will happily give you license to say ""cute"" free or charge.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com"
23,Happy Feet Two,7,17 November 2011,A Nutshell Review: Happy Feet Two,"Happy Feet took home the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year 2007, but that film had everything - song, dance, comedy, drama, romance and of course the feel good factor. One would have thought that success meant a fast-track into getting a sequel out, but it actually took some 5 years before it actually did. George Miller assume the entire directorial responsibility this time round, with the story co-written by Warren Coleman, Paul Livingston and George Miller somewhat making this a little bit darker in tone, with much less comedy, with more of a dark, brooding overtone that hammers home its environmental message.Gone are the colours and the more light hearted moments thanks to the Robin Williams voiced hippy penguin Ramon, who now takes a backseat to just trying his best to romance fellow penguin Carmen (Sofia Vergara), and in comes a terribly overt evangelistic feel with the presence of a new character The Mighty Sven (Hank Azaria), whom the penguins all worship for its flight ability, charisma and glib tongue. It cannot be more pronounced of the intent to show how these characters turn out to be nothing but false prophets, what with his miraculous ability of flight for a penguin, the rote religious preaches and sermons he gives, and not to forget the promise to deliver the emperor penguins from their current environmental plight, starting with the vast plans to provide fish for his new flock.New characters also got introduced to expand the scale of the story now to involve the smallest of life forms with two Krills, Will (Brad Pitt) and Bill (Matt Damon), the former adamant in striking out on his own and to evolve from a non-conformist environment where they swim around and be sitting ducks to larger prey, while the latter is the voice of rational thought, and comfort, joining Will only because he has but one friend. And on the other end of the size spectrum, we have the Leopard Seals with nasty, combative attitudes, whom you'd identify as key to the plot in the third act once Mumble (Elijah Wood) starts to tap his happy feet.Mumble is now all grown up and has a family of his own, with wife Gloria (voiced by the late Brittany Murphy in the earlier film, with singer Pink now taking over) and kid Erik (Ava Acres), a shy little one who neither can sing like his mom or dance like his dad, and becomes the prodigal son taking after his dad, well OK, the co-protagonist of this sequel. Why there's a need to have baby penguins boil down to the simple reason that they're cute, and will draw in the crowds. Much of the plot centres around how Mumble tries to connect with his young son, and finds it terribly tough to do so, but adversity no thanks to the threat faced by the entire Emperor Penguin community left stranded due to shifting ice, provides the opportunity especially when Erik can witness just how innovative and heroic his dad can actually be, compared to his idol Sven. Every boy needs a hero, and it works when one is close by.Like the Ice Age franchise which is still going on strong, the message about saving our environment, and with that the species which are dependent on the preservation of their natural habitat, can't get any more pronounced in this installment, especially with carefully crafted sound design and visuals to warn just how fragile this balance is, through the multiple shots of icy landscapes breaking up at every opportunity. With kids and their parents expected to make a beeline for this film, the target audience's all set in taking home these none too subtle reminders. There's a stoic seriousness in the story, though balanced by both Brad Pitt and Matt Damon's Krill characters being nothing other than comedic fodder with their rapid fire dialogue exchange, and Pitt's Will being one of the most delusional animated characters for some time to come.Some may frown at the religious overtones the narrative tended to dwell onto in the mid- section, and the many song and dance sequences and medleys that really padded up the film to a 100 minutes that felt longer than its runtime, but Happy Feet Two still had enough reserves in its tank to make it a wholesome family entertainer, though a lot more serious in treatment than its predecessor."
24,Happy Feet Two,7,23 February 2012,Does not warrant the poor score,"I was genuinely surprised to log on to IMDb and see such poor reviews of this film.The last Happy Feet started well and just lost all momentum from the point where Mumble was taken into captivity. It became slow and terribly boring.This film on the other hand was a treat. The characters were lovable and IDENTIFIABLE. I cannot grasp how people have such trouble recognising the characters. They make them thin, fat, or with blue eyes so you can tell them apart.The story with Will and Bill the Krill was easy to follow and extremely humorous! This storyline was full of adult humour.Overall the musical numbers weren't as good as Happy Feet 1 but there were more of them, further interspersed throughout the film and more recognisable songs. In Happy Feet 1 the songs dry up towards the middle. I would have liked to see more than just the boogie wonderland piece and this is what this film delivered. Of course there were moral lessons jammed in. Thats exactly how Happy Feet one was but I felt that at least in this film they were slightly less contrived.A very good film, despite all the critics."
25,Happy Feet Two,4,10 March 2012,"Spectacular visuals, a good voice cast and fun song and dance numbers are not enough to save the thin script and charmless and heavy-handed story","I want to start off saying that I liked the first Happy Feet. While it was not perfect, with a final twenty minutes(or so) that felt like a completely different movie, it was gorgeously animated and I loved the songs and choreography. I wasn't expecting the sequel to be as good, but I was not expecting it to be so disappointing either. Is it a terrible movie? I don't think so. The animation like with the first Happy Feet is simply spectacular, especially in the very detailed backgrounds. The characters are really cute looking too, then again I have always had a soft spot for penguins. The songs are also toe-tapping, with the best being Under Pressure, and the choreography dazzles, though I will be honest in saying that the first one in both areas was more memorable.The voice cast do an admirable job, Elijah Wood is suitably humble and Robin Williams is quite good if not as funny but it was Hank Azaria who stole the show. I wasn't so sure though about Pink as Gloria, she didn't do too bad a job but while I can understand why it was a different voice actress as Brittany Murphy had died I found Murphy brought more likability and charm to the character.On the other hand, the script feels thin here, nothing of note stands out, not helped by and the humour with the Krill felt out of place and unfunny to me. The Loney Goatherd yodel scene was the only one that made me smile at least. The characters I didn't like as much, there were too many to emphasize with and few of them charmed me in any way, Mumble is not as cute as he was in the first movie and his son Erik felt like one of those stereotypical ""kid of hero/heroine"" that you'll find in the Disney sequels for example, Lovelace is underused, Gloria is not as likable or as charming and the Krill despite enthusiastic vocal work from Matt Damon and Brad Pitt didn't amuse me in the slightest. In fact the sole bright spot was Sven.The biggest fault though was the story. Granted the story was not the first movie's strong point either, but despite the thin structure and preachy final act it was still cute and grasped my attention. This sequel doesn't do that. It is glacially paced, has next to none of the charm of the first one, is too anti-climatic and worst of all it doesn't seem to know what type of story it wants to be. It relies too much at times on the musical numbers, has a pointless side-story with the Krill and for me the whole story here actually manages to be more heavy-handed than the final act of the first movie.All in all, as much as I did want to like Happy Feet Two(and I am one of those who can understand why some will like it and some won't, likewise with the first), it was a disappointing and unnecessary sequel that has some things to like but has too many glaring flaws that sadly can't be overlooked. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
26,Happy Feet Two,10,10 November 2012,Highly recommended movie for kids and adults,"This is a really nice movie - with lovable characters, great voice (Robin Williams is hilarious as Ramon) acting, good animation and music.The story is sweet, and I have to say my 2 yr old boy can't get enough. I've now seen the beginning of the movie at least 5 times, and it's still enjoyable.No idea why it's only got a 5.8 rating here. I'm giving it a 10 to bump it up a bit.If you've got a young boy, I guarantee he'll love it - and you'll be entertained yourself."
27,Happy Feet Two,9,9 May 2014,Loved it for the main characters,"I only really loved this movie because of the main characters. This does not include Sven, however. I thought the sequel was rather darker than its prequel, but I loved it because of Mumble, Gloria, and Erik. I hated Sven as a character because I just thought he was a waste of the movie. He seems to think he can get everyone's attention in emperor land by making himself a fool! Trying to fly isn't the best way to make friends with an emperor penguin, especially if your a puffin! The elephant seals were very mean and selfish. There were too many other penguins in the story, and not enough of the five amigos! What is up with that?! It was as if the movie was crammed with too many characters. I wished they had focused more on the main ones that were in the first movie. Erik and Mumble were trying to get closer to each other, and I thought it was very touching that little Erik sung to Mumble at the end of the movie. This I thought was the best part! I loved Gloria for her singing talent, and let me say, she seems a bit tougher in this sequel! Mumble even seems a bit tougher also, although I have no idea why his fluff grew back! I love him with his fluff though, so it's no big deal! I thought the messages given were very good, but there were just too many characters in the movie that I didn't care for. Erik is the cutest little penguin you will ever meet! He was why I couldn't stop watching the movie anyway! If only they would have added more scenes with this little penguin, but it seemed as if the movie didn't contain enough of him. I was upset by some of the rude comments about how the music was unnecessary. Well, it just goes to show how nice people are when they judge a spectacular voice that they are jealous of! The music was beyond fantastic in my opinion, and to be honest, I listen to the songs all the time! There was a big chunk missing from the movie, and that was the way beginning. It seemed as if they cut out the beginning in my opinion. I love penguins, so that is why I love both Happy one and Happy Feet two!"
28,Happy Feet Two,8,14 September 2013,A decent follow-up to the first with the usual musical numbers and stunning visuals plus some comical new characters,"I rented this film before renting the first one to see how they compare and this one is on par with the first with some of its aspects better than others.The characters and backgrounds here are just as realistic as those in the first although it's environmental message isn't quite as valuable or memorable as that in the first. While Elijah Wood and Robin Williams reprise their roles as Mumble, Ramon and Lovelace respectively, Pink replaces Brittany Murphy (who sadly passed away in 2009 aged just 32 - RIP) as Gloria, so it is forgivable that Gloria's singing voice differs significantly here from that in the original but it is instantly recognisable. Her song 'Bridge Of Light' (not your average angsty Pink song) to encourage Erik to find more fish for the colony whilst being trapped by a giant iceberg is beautiful as well as the scene that accompanies it. Although it takes place at night, it is more detailed than the 'Somebody To Love' scene from the original and still has the lovely Northern-Lights style effect illuminating the sky. In addition to 'Bridge Of Light,', the best ones were the opening medley of 'Dance And Shout,' a version of 'SexyBack,' 'Ain't Nobody,' 'Do Your Thing' and 'Rhythm Nation' as well as a cute rap from one of the baby penguins; 'Under Pressure' during the climax; 'We Are The Champions (that's three Queen songs performed in the 'Happy Feet' franchise!)'and the amusing sing-songs of 'Dragostea Din Tei' (AKA the 'Mai a hee' song that everyone was singing back in 2004 - oh, the memories!) by Sven and 'Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' and 'Never Gonna Give You Up' by Bill the Krill. Further to the new characters, Erik is adorable but he looks very similar to baby Mumble in the first film and reminds me of a the typical Disney sequel offspring (especially Melody from 'The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea' since she wanted to be a mermaid while Erik wanted to fly like Sven); Sven is a hoot with a distinguishing Swedish accent albeit his involvement with the 'Liar revealed' cliché when he reveals he can fly because he's a puffin, not a penguin; while Will and Bill are comical side characters with a roller-coaster friendship. As for Carmen, she was pretty forgettable apart from being Ramon's love interest but she has a seductive Spanish accent. While Will, Bill and Sven were the funniest characters here, I chuckled when at the beginning of the film Mumble encouraged Erik to dance but Erik refused, Mumble said, ""say why"" to which Erik replied, ""Why."" As with other sequels, there are some elements of this one that are similar to those in the first such as Mumble spoiling the opening musical medley and the inclusion of real humans, this time on a boat to save Sven and Lovelace. The choreography is not as prominent as that in the original but Mumble still executes it perfectly.Overall this is a worthy follow-up to 'Happy Feet' with its character and background designs and musical numbers as its redeeming merits. 8/10."
29,Happy Feet Two,7,30 July 2012,A young penguin finds confidence.,"This is a cheery and positive sequel to the Oscar-winning HAPPY FEET. The acclaimed tap-dancing penguin Mumble(voice of Elijah Wood)and Gloria(voice of Pink)have started a family of their own. Erik(voice of Ava Acres)is a bit shy and lacking confidence because he hasn't found his rhythm and footing among his peers. The young Erik attempts to runaway and places his admiration in The Mighty Sven(voice of Hank Azaria), who can fly. Mumble starts a trek to find his son, while their Antarctic homeland becomes threatened. All is not lost; for it will take the entire Emperor Penguin nation to pull together and dance in unison to save their world...and Erik is proud to be part of the effort. Other voices you may recognize: Sofia Vergara, Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Garcia, Johnny A. Sancez and Brad Pitt. Kudos to director George Miller."
30,Happy Feet Two,10,14 January 2012,Loved Happy Feet 2,I think that this film is criticised too much. I absolutely loved the film and its storyline. I love the character of Mumble and how he is trying to be a good dad which is a real life problem for some men. This film made my Christmas list for 2012 and I cant wait to see again.The Music and dance numbers were fabulous and the actors who portray the voices of the characters were terrific. I love the fact they made a sequel of the film as I wanted more after the first movie. The Kril in this movie were hilarious and the family side for Mumble and Erik made me emotional as it shows a young child who realised that their true hero and role model is their Father.I cant wait to get this film on DVD and give it a 10 out of 10. I love Happy Feet and Happy Feet 2
31,Happy Feet Two,,20 November 2011,Happy Feet Two is... Number Two.,"WARNING: Spoilers.My companion, Stephanie, and I fought our way through the psychotic Breaking Dawn crowd to see Happy Feet Two. After getting into theater number six with tremendous effort, we surveyed our fellow film-goers (all who seemed to be over the age of fifty or under the age of five). Anyway, as we slipped on our obscenely geeky 3D glasses (they have to do something about those, by the way) and the film began, we quickly regretted our decision not to go see Breaking Dawn. Happy Feet Two opened with a large musical number with penguins singing and dancing reminiscent of the first Happy Feet movie. I don't trust movies that start with large musical numbers. They usually are trying to distract you from the lack of plot. But hey. So the movie was basically about Mumble's son, Erik, or something like that The penguins get stuck in a pit because of global warming and they all have to work together to save their lives. If only we had penguins in Washington Also. There was a random puffin bird. But even more random were Bill and Will the Krill, voiced by Matt Damon and Brad Pitt. I can assure you; they had nothing to do with the plot of the movie and were purely comic relief because this ended up being a dark film with heavy environmentalist agenda. Bill and Will were the saving grace of Happy Feet Two. If you rent this movie (because sure as heck don't pay ten bucks to see it), I suggest you fast forward to all the parts with the krill. Forget the doomed, dancing penguins. The main thing bugging me about this movie, besides the crappy musical numbers (although kudos to P!NK), dying polar bears, and Hugo Weaving as a penguin, is Mumble. He hasn't aged since the first movie. He is fluffy and yet has a chick. This is disturbing. Even though is movie sucked and was extremely random, little kids will probably like it. And I have to admit, the baby penguins (especially the one with the accent) are pretty darn cute. The 3D was good...But basically, if you want my advice, don't go see this movie. Don't take your kids. Don't take your dogs. Don't take your mother-in-law. They will have nightmares of drowning polar bears and oily puffins."
32,Happy Feet Two,6,18 November 2011,Tap dancing penguins are back!!!,"George miller gives us a pretty sleek family entertainer with awesome 3D and new characters Will the Krill,Bill the Krill,Atticus and much more.The plot is simple and revolves around Mumble & his kid Erik then there's just nothing all that special or urgent about any of it. The krills reminds the Ice Age's saber-toothed squirrel Scrat hunting for that pesky acorn,yet they did bring some of the funnier moments to the film.And for the music there are several pop remixes, of course, and songstress Pink (as Erik's mom)shows off her vocal chops, even as she reveals a limited acting range.The score, in a lack of imagination, also pilfers the classical music canon (somewhere, Puccini is rolling over in his grave).When it's not singing, the movie just yawns.In a nutshell average movie and easily forgotten."
33,Happy Feet Two,7,29 November 2011,The Story And Characters Are Better Developed Than In The Original,"Interestingly enough, I enjoyed this far more than I did the original ""Happy Feet."" I thought this movie had a much better developed and much more interesting (and even at times exciting) story, I thought that it had characters that overall were also better developed and most impressive was that it avoided the really in your face political message that characterized the first instalment. At the same time it held on to what worked well in the original movie - the superb animation and the good use of songs. The story once again revolves around the colony of Emperor Penguins in Antarctica, and especially around Mumble, the dancing penguin who's now married to Gloria and has a son. While Mumble and son Eric are away, the colony gets trapped by shifting ice and faces starvation if they can't find a way out. Enlisting the help of Ramon's penguin colony, which now includes a little puffin named Sven, and a herd of elephant seals, Mumble sets out to save them.It really did work well. The only think I found a bit awkward was the parallel storyline around Will and Bill - two krill who get separated from their swarm. That seemed an unnecessary addition to the story, and although the movie tried hard, I never thought the krill story fit into the overall story very well. Other than that, though, this was really quite well done, and, since I didn't really care for the first movie, it was a pleasant surprise. (7/10)"
34,Happy Feet Two,7,29 November 2011,Happy Feet Two is almost as entertaining as its predecessor,"Before I review this sequel to Happy Feet, I actually looked at my comments on the previous one to refresh my memory of that one. So once again, Mumble is voiced by Elijah Wood but wife Gloria-previously voiced by the late Brittany Murphy-is now played by Alecia Moore (better known as singer Pink). Robin Williams is also back in his two characters, one of whom has a budding romance with a penguin named Carmen voiced by Sofia Vergara. Among added characters are those of Will and Bill the Krills as enunciated by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon. They don't seem part of the story at first but they will once the climax comes. Just about everyone I mentioned have some amusing and entertaining moments but things don't really pick up until the avalanche scenes come on. As before the highlights are when they dance and sing various pop songs especially when ""Under Pressure"" comes on. So on that note, Happy Feet Two gets a recommendation from me."
35,Happy Feet Two,,4 December 2011,Singing penguins....again,"Admittedly, I did not like the first Happy Feet. Now, there's Happy Feet Two, with more dancing penguins and another story involving one of the penguins. I'm not even going to go into the plot because I run the risk of sounding childish or cliché. I will, however, say that this is one of the most puerile films of the year so far. Nothing in Happy Feet Two works, and I mean nothing. The story is not only childish, but it's also all over the place. The voice actors, led by a very questionably talented cast are awful. Also, just like with my Puss In Boots review, I saw this at a legit I max 3D theater, and the I max added nothing to the film, and the 3D just made the film look worse. This is not to blame the theater for, but the film for. The fact that this is a film about dancing, singing penguins, I guess I should have expected not to have an awesome I max experience, but I at least expected a little something to be added. With all this hate I seem to have for Happy Feet Two, you would think I thought this was a terrible film. With this being said, it's not. Happy Feet Two will certainly amuse its target audience-kids, but it's the parents who'll have to take them to it I'm worried about. No one will accuse Happy Feet Two of being one of the worst films of the year, but even more so, they won't accuse Happy Feet Two of being one of the best films of the year."
36,Happy Feet Two,8,9 December 2011,"Indifferent to the first one, I loved this","I was not first in the queue at the multiplex when Happy Feet came out. Despite being a fan of CGI movies, I'm not a dancing enthusiast and, frankly, I got the joke - dancing penguins, ha ha - without actually seeing the film. Also, much as I like Robin Williams live and in straight roles, I can have enough of him quite quickly when he is voicing animated characters. Anyway, I finally saw it, and it was exactly what I expected - OK, albeit the underlying gag was not sufficient to underpin a feature-length movie.Clearly, I was out of step, because in due course along comes Happy Feet 2. Oh well, I reasoned, hopefully the 3D will be enough to keep me interested.Now it seems that not only was I out of step on Happy Feet 1, I'm also out of step on Happy Feet 2, because I loved it. The dancing is kept to a minimum and such dancing as there is takes place in strict service to the demands of the plot. After what looked as if it was going to be, worryingly, a retread of the first movie (Mumbles' young son Eric is also rhythmically challenged and wanders unhappily away from the Emperor penguins' colony), Eric's terpsichorean shortcomings are overlooked as a) we meet some new characters - specifically an Australian elephant seal and a pair of Krill (voiced wonderfully by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon), and b) a huge iceberg traps the Emperor colony, putting them at risk of starvation. Only Mumbles, Eric, and Eric's two chick friends can (with help) save the day.There is a lot more story here than in the first film, and much of it is very suspenseful. There are some wonderful visuals, some hysterically funny dialogue from the two Krill (Will and Bill Krill - Will is determined to reverse roles and become a carnivorous predator, to the horror of his meek friend Bill), and some inspired moments which choke you up with emotion at the same time as making you laugh. I never thought I would use the adjective ""idotically"" with the noun ""beautiful"", but when a pack of Krill start geometric pulsations of their fluorescence in time to their tap dancing to Under Pressure on the underside of an iceberg, idiotically beautiful is the only way to describe what you are seeing.Oh, and the 3D, while not essential, has some spectacular moments.I loved it."
37,Happy Feet Two,9,26 November 2011,Great movie !,"YYIIHAAA.. great movie. Just as nice as the first version. Children and adults who like animation movies : this is the movie for the X-mas days. Don't miss it. I like my Happy Feet friends on the big screen. But not all the penguins are happy because the ice rock they live on, is melting. There is a funny, virtual, non-profit penguin event to stop the climate crisis so the penguins keep living like they prefer. If you like these animals (on the screen and also alive) and are also worried about the non-natural climate changes ... please enjoy this event : ""Defart"" your penguin with Beans Airways, enjoy the flight,find a good place for your igloo and reserve some space for your friends on the virtual streets in Durban, and enjoy the party at the beach. Enjoy on pissedoffpenguins.com"
38,Happy Feet Two,,18 November 2011,"Man, Can Those Penguins Dance!","Like its predecessor, ""Happy Feet Two"" succeeds by reaching beyond the expectations of an animated family comedy. It's not that there's music; it's that the music is expertly orchestrated and perfectly in sync with the visuals. It's not that there's singing and dancing; it's that both are handled with the care and precision of a professional stage production, and that they're done on a scale large enough that it surpasses amusement and achieves an unexplainable satisfaction. Not bad when you consider that all the dancers are penguins. The animation is spectacular, the Antarctic renderings are superb, the characters are engaging, the plot is both fun and timely, and the voice work is on par with the best cartoon movies. The biggest surprise is the 3D, which is bright enough to see and immersive enough to seem uncanny.If you recall the original film, an emperor penguin named Mumble was ostracized because he could dance but not sing. Since that time, Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood) has not only been accepted by his fellow penguins but has also made dancing itself acceptable. Indeed, the film opens with brilliant display of choreography, with penguins tapping their feet, shaking their tails, and waving their flippers as far as the eye can see. In an ironic twist of fate, Mumble's young son, Erik (voiced by E.G. Daily), lacks the ability to dance and feels out of place. When he and a group of friends ventures to neighboring penguin nation  where we're reintroduced to the sassy Ramon (voiced by Robin Williams)  he witnesses a congregation presided over by the zealous Lovelace (also voiced by Williams) and a new character, a Swedish puffin named The Mighty Sven (voiced by Hank Azaria), who passes himself off as a penguin with the ability to fly.Erik is inspired by Sven and thinks he has finally found his purpose in life. How can Mumble break it to him that penguins cannot actually fly? At the moment, that doesn't much matter; the melting of ice sheets and rapid movement of glaciers has changed the land to such a degree that Mumble's people are trapped. This would include his love, Gloria (voiced by Pink, replacing the late Brittany Murphy). Freeing them depends on the destruction of a massive ice shelf. This will require far more than the assistance of Lovelace and his penguin nation. It will also require elephant seals, including a bully who calls himself The Beach Master (voiced by Richard Carter). How he comes to be in Mumble's service, I leave for you to discover.In an odd and disconnected but no less enjoyable subplot, two krill, known alliteratively as Will and Bill (voiced by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon), have strayed away from their swarm. One of them learns some hard facts about his place on the food chain and is determined to become a fearsome carnivore. Working his way up the ladder, you might say. The other is a neurotic who clings to his friend like a frightened puppy dog. I honestly don't remember which one is which, but to be perfectly honest, I don't think it matters. They're both given some of the film's wittiest lines  as well as a slew of obvious puns that only add to their charm. Their scenes show the best utilization of the 3D process, I suspect they mostly take place underwater. I don't know what it is about underwater shots and their positive effect on 3D. Perhaps it has something to do with the illusion of density, or the fact that air bubbles can come directly into your field of vision.Part of what makes these movies so worthwhile is the effort to make audiences conscious of pressing social issues  such as tolerance, persecution, and individuality  and documented environmental concerns  such as human interference with nature, pollution, and of course, global warming. Director George Miller and his writers are not content to simply pander to children and their families. Yes, they want them to laugh and have a good time, but they also want them to be aware of themselves and of what's going on in the world. In the wrong hands, this would be mistaken as propaganda. If I've given you pause, let me assure you that this movie contains nothing of the sort.""Happy Feet Two"" is above all exuberant entertainment, a song and dance extravaganza with an infectious soundtrack. In this regard, Pink was a wise casting choice. There's more to it than her ability to sing; there's empathy in her voice, an emotional resonance that lets me know her character is not only a mother but also a deeply caring person. Her solo number midway through the film (also included on the first film's soundtrack) signals the appearance of the aurora australis, which is, needless to say, a beautiful sight to behold, especially in 3D. Some have been critical of these movies, but I for one am glad that we have them. They don't follow the rules of the traditional animated movie  no soppy love stories, no mindless comedy bits, no ""playing down"" to the level of the audience. They are, in a word, unique.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
39,Happy Feet Two,2,27 November 2011,bad,it was OK but not the best the ending was good but the beginning was shaky but it was still a good movie i thought it would be better but it was OK i mean it was a good 3d movie but it was bad it was OK but not the best go see Hugo instead of this movie i liked it but not as good as Hugo or the muppets or Winnie the pooh but it was still good but if you are looking for a movie that you will laugh on do not each this movie because there was too much dancing and singing it was not good the first one was better than this one this movie stinks it is not the movie that you would say is good i mean a penguin that can fly that is wearied it was bad i hated this movie i will not see this movie ever again it was horrible i hated more than any movie i have ever seen it was stupid it was a good 3d movie but that is it it was a good IMAX 3d movie but that is it is not good
40,Happy Feet Two,9,14 November 2011,Happy Feet 2.0; Great visuals - state of the art. A darker storyline that adults will love,"The first thing that stood out for me in the movie is the absolute scale of most of the shots, thousands of penguins dancing, with it all feeling natural instead of it looking like a giant copy and paste operation with a bunch of a cloudy and blurry wiggles all over the screen. The penguins seamlessly transform from the documentary penguin visuals we are accustomed to, to the talking penguins. Visually and technically, it's a marvel and the ticket price is worth it for that alone.The first Happy Feet was five years ago and I remember it having a lighthearted feel to it. This new Happy Feet Two movie starts with a foreboding view of earth from space where the ice shelves are cracking off from the south pole. It then moves to a penguin dance to the song ""Rhythm Nation"" that is almost a military march and then to our our new baby penguin protagonist Erik, who is unable to both sing or dance. Gone are the themes of heart-songs and tap dancing. The south pole has become a dangerous ice jungle with calamities and predators at every corner. The themes have changed from individualistic to the nationalistic, the characters from didactic to the cautionary. I think adults will enjoy this change of tone but I don't know how kids will feel about the new dark and non-individualistic themes.The most jarring aspect of the movie is the accents. Some characters have neutral American accents while some have African-American stylings. Sea-elephants have British accents as do some penguins. A different nation of penguins all have Spanish accents. I don't know if there is a method behind all these accents but I can't help but imagine an underlying social or political commentary in the story. Or, it could just be my imagination.Overall, it's a great movie and I suggest you definitely go see it. The ticket price is worth it for the visuals alone. The engaging story and the great singing are just bonus value."
41,Happy Feet Two,3,3 May 2012,Ugh!,"Happy Feet 1 came out and was basically consisting of two plots. One, a penguin trying to fit in, and two humans are evil. As I said in my Happy Feet One review:""Now, let me explain. I love the Earth. I love the creatures. I want us to take care of them. Keep them healthy, happy and strong. Let's learn about them. Understand them.But I also know that humans are not the only cause, if any cause at all, to the problems with the world. I mean, global warming? Really? The message I got from this movie was to never give up even if you are different, and that humans are evil. The first one was okay. But the story was weak. The humans are evil part was just annoying. If you're going to frame us, do it in a clever way.""Now I've changed my views a little since 2010 (when I reviewed it) but I still believe that movies like these are only made for political messages. They are usually negative toward humans and are bias to one side.This movie continues the story of the penguins. Now the rejected one who can dance is a father and his kid is basically trying to figure out what he can do. So we already have a repeated story. Then the kid discovered a penguin who is able to fly somehow (we find out how later on in the movie) and the new penguin wants to fly too. So for half the movie he tries to fly. Meanwhile the penguins are... hmm what would make a good 30-45 minutes of a movie? Oh I know, make the penguins trapped in a hole from the ice. Good idea!So now we have the father penguin and his kids who have to feed their tribe or group or clan or whatever a set of penguins are called. Meanwhile the kids somehow have British accents while the parents do not. What?** MAJOR SPOILER BELOW **Then finally at one point the little penguin discovers that he can sing... well very badly at least. Long story short, father penguin is seeking help and is refused it. The little kid decides to sing a song about how great is father is. It could have been emotional... if the kid's singing wasn't so high pitched and hurt my hears to death! Plus he went into the whole opera style singing and everything, uck!** MAJOR SPOILER ENDS **I'm surprised that the humans didn't do anything much in this movie. I mean, they showed the humans cooking turkeys in their ship (how dare they want to feed themselves), and they come and show up to help the penguins escape, but then they disappear after a snow storm. That's it. Nothing about a human taking a penguin and capturing it to show how evil we are, just boring lame humans cooking food to eat.The plot was better than I though, so I gave it a 3/10. It could have been 4/10 but that singing was terrible (the little kid's, no offense but it hurt my ears) and what's with the kids having British accents? That's just annoying. So in the end, I rate this movie 3/10."
42,Happy Feet Two,8,23 February 2012,worth watching,"not like the first, but also nice.. what i want to say is that the song that sven tells it's from his homeland in Spanish..actually it's in Romanian, from Romania sang by former band ""O-zone"" and the songs name is ""Dragostea din tei"" . you will find it on youtube,google.. i kinda felt offended..they were huge and they should be known as romanians.. they used it without knowing its origins, nothing.. the movie it's great..but i do hope it's the last happy feet.. there's no need for a third one,really! i do like pink's voice though.. i strongly recommend it for all ages.. it's not the usual boring and predictable movie that producers nowadays make.."
43,Happy Feet Two,,20 November 2011,"Less happy feet, but the story still soars","The list containing sequels which were superior or equal to the original films is a short one indeed, and contains such classics as ""Superman II,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Godfather, Part II."" An animated picture from earlier this year, ""Kung Fu Panda 2,"" made this survey and now, the second installment of ""Happy Feet,"" the penguin-centric Oscar-winner for Best Animated Feature in 2006, sneaks aboard, as well.Not better than its predecessor, but certainly right up there, ""Happy Feet 2"" picks up where the last ended and carries the story of Emperor Penguin Mumbles (voice of Elijah Wood) and Gloria (one-time pop star Pink) to new heights, thanks to a plot involving their son, Erik (Ava Acres), and his crazy dream of being only the second penguin to fly.The first, evidently, is Sven (Hank Azaria of ""The Simpson's"" fame), a mysterious character who is rescued by humans and who - in turn - saves the life of Lovelace (Robin Williams) after he views their ""future"" aboard a trawler.We'll leave this future to the viewer, but nevertheless, it imbues the ""mighty"" Sven with a panic attack at the least opportune time. Meanwhile, little Erik and his friends follow the outcast Ramon (Robin Williams, again) - cast away because he was too short to date Emperor girls - to the edge of the ice cap before Mumbles finds them and seeks to lead them home.While in Ramon's territory, they meet the charismatic (and enigmatic) Sven, who re-iterates his saga of just how he learned to fly (""If you will it, it will become you,"" he intones)- but he is hiding a shameful secret. On the way home, Mumbles saves the life of Beachmaster Bryan the Elephant Seal (Richard Carter), but soon discovers his own territory has been made inaccessible because of the collapse of a rogue iceberg.While this is going on, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon (as Will and Bill the Krill) lead the comic relief as a reluctant plankton and his more-than-accommodating partner. And while these scenes almost reach ""Brokeback Mountain""-like intensity, the humor of a tiny shrimp trying to move up on the food chain is often hilarious.As is his final acceptance of his lot in life (""The carnivore is over, my friend."") Because of his ability to make friends - and peace, and because little Erik - who has some anger issues - turns out to have the voice of an angel, Mumbles is able to assemble a group of divergent Antarctic creatures in an attempt to save his flock from starvation.It's all very well done, and the direction from George Miller (""Happy Feet,"" ""Babe: Pig In the City,"" ""Lorenzo's Oil"") is appropriately upbeat. Plus, if you're like me, you just might find yourself singing along to tunes like ""Papa Oo Mow-Mow"" and ""Under Pressure,"" among others.Bad sequels, such as oh, ""The Hangover, Part 2,"" would have been wise to emulate a well-know secret in this regard. Include the same lovable cast members and even the familiar locale, but for gosh sakes, shake up the story and even add a few (hopefully) likable new characters to the mix.This is what ""Kung Fu Panda, 2"" and this feature were able to do, and it shows in a quality finished product."
44,Happy Feet Two,,11 November 2011,The toe-tapping penguins are back- what's not to like?,"Content not to be left out in the cold (pun intended) while we party- animals dance and sing to the infectious beats of Justin Timberlake's 'Sexyback', the toe-tapping Emperor penguins from George Miller's 2006 animated hit 'Happy Feet' are back in the inevitable sequel- yes inevitable, since their maiden visit did make a whopping US$384mil worldwide and steal away the Oscar for Best Animated Film from Pixar. The sequel also sees Miller returning as co-writer and director, and that probably explains the retread of familiar themes from the predecessor.The first movie celebrated difference through our hero Mumble, whose innate talent in tap-dancing and lack thereof in singing made him unlike his peers. Difference is once again the theme of this sequel, as Mumble finds that his son Erik (Elizabeth Daily, who voiced the young Mumble in the first film) is choreophobic and refuses to join the colony which has since embraced dance as a form of celebration. Erik sees no reason to dance, and after an attempt leaves him embarrassed, decides to leave the colony together with Ramon (Robin Williams) to find his place. As with its predecessor, the sequel finds the eccentric Ramon taking the misfit Emperor penguin on a journey of discovery, a journey which leads them to a colony of Adele penguins led by returning Rockhopper penguin Lovelace (also the voice of Robin Williams) and The Mighty Sven (Hank Azaria). Sven's ability to fly has the entire colony in awe, and that includes Erik, who becomes fascinated that penguins can indeed will the ability to take to the skies. We're not quite sure why, but accepting that penguins can fly is somewhat more difficult than accepting penguins that can sing and dance- thankfully, Miller and his co-writers Gary Eck, Warren Coleman and Paul Livingston have a handy explanation for that unusual phenomenon. Nonetheless, they aren't so creative with resolution and once again it is through the fate of the colony that Erik finds his purpose. Food is yet again the colony's problem, as a breakaway ice sheet seals the penguins in on all sides. If you're guessing rescue means teaching the Emperors how to fly, let us reassure you that it is fortunately not so straightforward, but rather a multi-species effort which includes the Adeles, the walruses and the krill underneath the sea- the last of which are really unsuspecting allies in the rescue effort. It's a massive undertaking no doubt, even more so for the animators (led by animation director Rob Coleman) who have truly outdone themselves in terms of scope. One can only imagine the work that must have gone into every detail bringing together so many species and so many individual beings together in one frame, so kudos to the team for their exceptional work. Yet amidst the visual cornucopia, Miller seems to have forgotten about Erik and his supposed coming-of-age journey- and anyone looking for a similarly touching tale as that of Mumble's in 'Happy Feet' will probably be disappointed. Erik's story comes at the expense of a more varied list of characters- besides Ramon and Lovelace, there's also Ramon's brown-eyed love interest Carmen (Sofia Vergara), a brown-skinned elephant seal Bryan (Richard Carter) whom Mumble saves along the way, and two bromantic krill Will (Brad Pitt) and Bill (Matt Damon) who have broken away from their school to find some higher meaning in their tiny existence. In fact, you're likely to come off having a deeper impression of the pair of krill- who are also blessed with some of the best lines- than of our flurry protagonist Erik. And if Erik takes a backseat to the sheer number of characters populating the film, then returning ones such as Gloria (singer Alecia Moore, better known as 'Pink', taking over from the late Brittany Murphy) and Noah the Elder (Hugo Weaving) get even shorter shrift. Ramon also gets less screen time than Williams' other character Lovelace, whose friendship with Sven is explained in a perplexing black-and-white flashback that is told all too quickly and likely to leave one in bewilderment. Speaking of which, humans yet again feature in the sequel, though unlike before, their role here is largely ancillary to the penguins' predicament. But certainly we were never part of the appeal of 'Happy Feet' to begin with- which was undoubtedly the fun of seeing penguins sing and tap- dance. Save for Pink's 'Bridge of Light' which gets a three-minute airing in the film, the former is surprisingly lacklustre- and the medleys of popular hits sung by the chorus of penguins mostly forgettable. Luckily, the tap-dancing (led once again by Savion Glover for Mumble) is just as delightful, especially to catchy tunes such as the Romanian hit song 'Dragostea Din Tei'. Kudos once again to the animation team for their amazing rendition of the dance moves, especially for the finale, where- suffice to say- tap-dancing plays a significant role. The outstanding animation is enough to warrant a recommend to family audiences, and it's safe to say that tap-dancing penguins will still appeal to both adults and kids alike. Yes, if you've loved the first one, you're likely to find much to like about this sequel. Pity however that director George Miller has decided to stick to the tried-and-tested formula of the first movie, which likely explains the similarity in themes and storytelling- though the latter admittedly pales in comparison no thanks to a less than compelling story arc for lead character Erik. It's not likely to repeat the Oscar feat it scored six years ago, but this sequel is not without its charms and those looking for an enjoyable family-friendly animation with its own eco-message to boot will find some toe-tapping fun here."
45,Happy Feet Two,10,10 May 2017,good,Perfect movie it was so good since i'm a 11 year old i approve it they should make a 3 in 2018 i was left with too much questions. 10/10.

Loved it hope you guys love it so i hope to see another one and i have to go to school so Ya in general really good title
46,Happy Feet Two,7,24 October 2016,"Wonderful voices returns, showing us new morals.","A new Happy Feet film? Oh dear, I was really surprised that George Miller, decided to actually make a sequel of the lovely, singing (and dancing) penguins. But can I hate him for that? No way! Happy Feet is one of my all time favorite animated films, so I was defiantly going to watch this. And I gotta say, the movie still leaves a smile on me. This is a spoiler review, so be aware.So Mumble has a son, and we already learn that he is going through some small difficulties, about being different. But that's only in the beginning. Later on, it's like that he had what he needed all along, but it's as if they wanted us to remember, how Mumble was feeling in the first film. I was afraid that they would give us, the same kind of plot from the previous movie. Thankfully, we don't. Erik just needs to find something, that can prove to himself that he does have some talent. And by doing that through the new character, Sven, he leads us to new stories that caught me interested, as we get to see humans again.And now to the other plot of the movie. The penguins of the Emperor Penguin world are stuck, behind a gigantic glacier and they need to get them out of there. By doing so, the movie shows us how the different breeds of penguins helps them out, the power of teamwork with not just the same race, but along with the walruses too, in which the conflict between Mumble and the walrus, Bryan, seemed to have made something.Also, the sub-plot of Will and Bill the Krills are adoring. Its good to see that certain characters in the movie, wants to learn more about the situations they live in, and are prepared for. The movie is well made to be loved, by all family members. But it's as if they didn't think, of a reasonable plot to give some morals to the audience. They make sure that the audience do understand it, and that's good. But whenever I just compare it to the first film, it's clear that they were perhaps having a bit difficulty, of how to progress this film.I have to say though, the songs in this movie is performed extraordinary, in which I get shivers down my spine each time. And I always love when movies can make certain impacts on me, so that's why that this is still a fun and lovable movie for me. They teach us more morals that we can understand, and it's well enough made for children to understand that too. It's not a bad movie, but I think they could have worked better on some things."
47,Happy Feet Two,6,14 June 2016,Although the plot is very predictable and the characters very unappealing but it has its moments.,"The kids will love it because of couple of sing along songs and a few good laughs; but for adults there is not much in this movie. Same old theme we've seen in many animated movies before. A guy who is different, is lonely, is a misfit and ends up saving his own folks. The pros of the movie are the music and the upbeat songs which can really get you going particularly'the mighty Sven'. Hank Azaria's voice over for Sven is marvelous and is one of his better performances in recent times.It appears that the movie was made in a haste. Many characters such Bill and Will are completely superfluous and uninteresting. If it's supposed to be an animated movie then why aren't the humans animated."
48,Happy Feet Two,2,3 February 2016,Not Happy With Any Feet Here.,"Happy Feet 2 (2011): Dir: George Miller / Voices: Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Hank Azaria, Alecia Moore, Sofia Vergera: Pathetic followup to the popular kids animation that seemed released on the heels of March of the Penguins. This sequel is disappointing with its evangelistic take on the Mighty Sven. This is disturbing and its target audience will not likely get it. Elijah Wood voices Mumble whose son is inspired by the Mighty Sven. This bothers Mumble but he does manage to save a father elephant seal. Robin Williams voices Ramon who finds love. The only characters of interest are Sven, voiced by Hank Azaria who is actually a puffins who fakes as a flying penguin, and two krill who seek adventure outside their normal environment. Plot melts away faster than ice in a microwave, and the climax is actually not as surprising as it should be. It involves glaciers moving and thousands of penguins trapped in a snowy valley unable to climb out. Mumble is not very interesting, and Ramon is more or less Williams doing standup. Araria brings life to Sven who means well but has a concealed past. Alecia Moore voices Gloria, Mumble's romantic other and although it is great to hear her beautiful voice in song, the role is cardboard. Sofia Vergara also lends her standout voice to this animated junk. Directed by George Miller who made Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and Babe: Pig in the City. He is experienced in this sort of genre and is backed with stunning animated visuals, but the only feet that will be happy are those shuffling towards the exit after the film. Score: 2 ½ / 10"
49,Happy Feet Two,4,11 June 2015,Good animation isn't enough these days,"Even if there is tons of that like in this film here. I liked the first film mostly for the charm and emotional story lines, for example the one about Mumble and his dad. This sequel, which came out five years after the first, lacks completely in that area. They tried to do the same as in the first film (that won the Best Animated Feature Oscar) in some areas, for example they included once again a mix of live action and animation with the animation being the far dominant part. However, this turned out a disappointment. Not even the small fluffy penguins were a delight anymore as they were written so annoyingly with stupid rap songs and without the slightest ounce of obedience to their elders. Talking about the music, it was really really bad early on, but got a bit better as the film went wrong. Still I heavily object to the casting of Pink here. In terms of voice acting, she adds nothing to this movie, simply because she never does it. All she does is sing and her loud scratchy voice did not bring any emotion that this film was so badly in need of. She even sort-of destroyed the final scene with her rendition of Queen's ""Under Pressure"". As an animal choir the way it started I liked it, but then she started singing and all the magic was gone.This movie was shout completely at the Annie Award (animation Oscar) that year and that says it all. It is a bit of a joke this film had 3 directors and 6 writers and this is what they came up with. Truly embarrassing. The core filmmaker was also the one who directed the first ""Happy Feet"" movie and he is otherwise mostly known for directing ""Mad Max"" (the old and the new). What a strange collection of movies he worked on. It does not get any further apart than ""Mad Max"" and ""Happy Feet"". One of the film's intended most emotional moments was when the walrus is trapped and Mumble goes to rescue him, so he can reunite with his children. Sadly, the execution really took out all the emotion for some reason. This could have been so much more. Apart from that, this scene made it obvious that the walrus would return the favor at some point later in the movie and now this film was not only void of any heart, but also fairly predictable. The film gets a bit better after the 30-minute-mark, but that does not mean that it becomes a quality movie, just that it really really sucked early on.Another oddity in here is the inclusion of Brad Pitt and Matt Damon as voice actors. I wonder what they were thinking including the duo as krill. I guess they only wanted to advertise the film with these two superstars as their characters basically had nothing to do at all with Mumble and the gang. It was like they were in their own movie, even more extreme than with Scrat and the ""Ice Age"" films. And Bill's and Will's storyline adds absolutely nothing to this sequel here. So far, there is no news yet about a third ""Happy Feet"" installment and I do not really think it is necessary unless they somehow manage to come up with something a lot better than they achieved here. The director is busy anyway right now with the ""Mad Max"" sequel, but who knows. Between film 1 and 2, also a lot of time went by.Another weakness is that the film takes itself so seriously at times and then again is so goofy and childish on other occasions. You really don't know what to think of that. For example there are really all kinds of musical styles in here from rap music to almost opera music or stuff you would expect in ""Les Misérables"". The only truly positive thing here was the animation. The finale was mesmerizing to watch actually and that was only on a small computer screen. But as I wrote in the title: This is not enough."
50,Happy Feet Two,4,1 April 2015,Unnecessary Sequel,"Just like the 'Cars' sequel, the 'Happy Feet' sequel doesn't have the charm of the original. Coincidentally both Cars 2 and Happy Feet Two were released in 2011. 'Happy Feet Two' follows the story of 'Erik' who is the son of 'Mumble' and 'Gloria' from Happy Feet. Just like Mumble, Erik seems to be finding difficult to fit into the society. Erik can't dance! While the story may seem very similar, the first-half is quite engaging with the creative story line of interesting characters like the krills and Sven the puffin. The second half is honestly a let- down and the whole penguins stuck by the wall of ice thing didn't work well. Most the things that happen feel unnecessary and extravagant. Thus by the time we reach the climax, the story is all over the place. Erik doesn't get the spotlight he needed to get and even in the end where he shows his talent it was very less impact. Despite its good moments, Happy Feet Two feels like bland unnecessary sequel to a heart- warming film.RATING: [2/5]"
51,Happy Feet Two,7,19 December 2013,Quite enjoyable,"How can you not laugh when there are two lunatics like Will (Brad Pitt) and Bill (Matt Damon) giving their voices to two strange krill who are stepping out of the ordinary life they got used to and lived by it.As I have looked upon the grade given by IMDb people I was skeptic at first, thinking how can this low grade movie be fun, boy was I wrong. It really is funny, interesting, lot's of interesting music, music that you recognize etc...Who is up for some laugh this is definitely movie for you, especially when you have that two krill that will make you laugh, I know I laughed hard. I give it 7 because it lack depth of story, some moments were rushed, on and all definitely watchable."
52,Happy Feet Two,9,10 November 2011,Nice family movie just in time for the holidays!,"I gave this a 9 because, for once, 3D worked extremely well in a movie. Beautiful content once you put those glasses on! Now for the movie. A nice new twist on the Happy Feet story (I personally didn't enjoy the 1st one as much as this one). Pink did a wonderful job as Gloria but somehow I still missed Brittany Murphy's voice. Great casting done on film and it was nice to meet new characters. My favorites were Will & Bill Krill (played by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon) who in my opinion quite stole the show! My daughters (both teenagers) really liked it so it works for all ages and we all left the theater quite happy after seeing it."
53,Happy Feet Two,6,9 July 2013,great movie for kids to watch,"it was made good for the targeted audience. This movie had good lessons for kids. So if you are a parent I would let your child watch this. It taught kids that you can do what seems to be the impossible if you work together. It also teaches that things/people are not always what they seem. then there is a lesson with a father and son not seeing eye to eye. the story line is not all that good. it starts with the son running away and ends with them having to save the penguin colony. then there is what seems to be no reason for this kelp story. and they keep going to it and sure they somewhat interact with the main story, and you don't find out till the end that they are only in the story to teach you that one fish/person can change/save the ways of the people. similar to the one person can make a change in the world, its almost like they made the movie then realized that it was to short so they said lets add this, we can teach the kids a valuable lesson."
54,Happy Feet Two,7,23 May 2013,Kids Will Like It!,"Happy Feet Two, the sequel to 2006's Oscar-winning hit Happy Feet, is a good follow-up and has some nice toe-tapping tunes, but fails to repeat what made the first film a hit. The animation, as always, is lush and beautiful. The story itself is a bit weak and is a drastic drop-off from the original. The story also over does it with philosophical reasonings. I don't think the audience want to hear that. That being said, the tunes are well-sung. I really liked it when they performed Queen. The voice-acting is great which is always a plus in animated features.George Miller's film takes place a few years later with Mumble and Gloria having kids of their own. The kids escape their parents to fool around and the penguin nation gets trapped by a glacier. Now it's up to the kids and some allies to save the day.As mentioned before, I thought the voice-acting is good. Pink gets a pass since she is better than expected replacing the late Brittany Murphy. Even though I have no idea why the krill were in the film as they had nothing to do with the penguins, but Matt Damon and Brad Pitt added some good comedy to the film.Overall, this is a beautifully-animated musical but it's not as good as the original. I'm surprised that the film had such a deep drop-off at the box office. I think they should leave this franchise alone if the quality will keep getting worse. I liked this film, but this sequel is not necessary. I rate this film 7/10."
55,Happy Feet Two,2,22 September 2012,Terrible. Disgraceful even.,"I gave this two stars as I suppose it would keep children entertained. That's its only redeeming quality.The first film was a wonderful surprise; a CGI movie which wasn't just made for little kids, and which had an engaging, unpredictable story as well as some terrific voice actors. This sequel is essentially a very cheap copy, a money grab slapped together to capitalize as much as possible on the first film.There's essentially no plot. The penguins get trapped in a ravine and have to find their way out. That's it. Elijah Wood's lines amount to little more than chasing his annoying kid and trying to somehow teach him morals.This film completely lacks the charm of its predecessor - which didn't call for a sequel at all."
56,Happy Feet Two,1,21 November 2011,Did not like the gay comments in children's movie,"I think its pretty ridiculous I have to go watch a pg rated movie first before I take my children. I checked IMDb before taking my 4 and 6 year old to see this movie nowhere did it have a disclaimer about the gay krill characters bill and will. Since when are openly gay characters considered rude comments? The movie would have been just fine if they had left out the part with him saying we can just be life partners, and adopt children. I heard no less than three other parents gasp when they heard this comment and one couple even walked out with their child after hearing it. Is animated PG not considered a children's movie any longer? I do not understand the need to put comments like these into a movie and ruin it. My children are just that children and I have no reason for them to grow up before its time. If this type of stuff is being put in pg rated movies they can count not receiving my business any longer."
57,Happy Feet Two,10,22 November 2011,Happy Feet 2 is the most underrated movie of the year,"I was surprised by the box office performance this movie had. It is too good of a movie to fall behind Gnomeo & Juliet. I saw it and I thought it was better than it's Oscar winning predecessor. Some people complained about the plot but I thought that was one of its strengths. It was never dull at any moment and didn't have a bland story. There were many moments in the film where I got chills. The impact it had on me was tremendous. I think the love shown between Mumble, Gloria and Erik is beautiful and shows that with love anything is possible. I could never be a professional movie critic because they usually never get accurate opinions. Braveheart and Gladiator both had many bad reviews and still won best picture. This is the same case for Happy Feet 2 except I see it only winning best animated feature film. Unlike many sequels, this movie steps up to the plate and does not disappoint. If it doesn't win the Oscar, it will be the Academy that truly disappoints the movie industry."
58,Happy Feet Two,6,8 March 2012,Much like the recent cartoon sequels it's not as good as the original and it's more adult then needed. I say B-.,"""If you want it, you must will it. If you will it, it will be yours."" When Mumble's (Wood) son Erik begins to question if he has talent or not he meets Ramon (Williams) and the amazing flying penguin Sven. When Erik's dream is to fly Mumble tries ways to let him know that he can't fly. After an event occurs that causes an iceberg to trap the rest of the penguin clan it is up to Mumble, Ramon and the rest of the group to save them all. I liked the first one but was never that crazy about watching it again. My favorite part was Robin Williams (he is great in pretty much everything though) and the music was great. Like most cartoons lately it got a sequel (weather they need one or not). This one once again falls into the same category as the rest of the latest cartoon sequels. They try to add a more grown up story and focus less on what made the first one so fun to watch. This is a good movie for kids but there is something missing to make it as good as the first one. I do have to say that the Krill played by Brad Pitt & Matt Damon far and away stole the movie and was the only part I really enjoyed. Overall, not a bad movie but it's missing all the stuff that made the first one fun to watch. My kids liked it but started to get bored towards the end. I give it a B-. My kids give it an A"
59,Happy Feet Two,,6 May 2012,Boring feast,"This film is about two tribes of penguins having to dance together to save themselves from starvation.""Happy Feet Two"" is not happy at all, in fact it sorrowfully lacks the uplifting atmosphere required for a children's film. The plot is poor even considering that it is for children. The first twenty minutes have not really got a plot, it only shows the penguins bursting spontaneously into songs and dances. After that, the plot finally arrives, but it is so ridiculous and boring. Are we really supposed to be entertained by animals stomping their feet to break an iceberg? It doesn't even make sense, as the collapsing iceberg should send the dancing penguins above into a free fall, and crush the penguins below. The presence of the two shrimps is far too random. It is only tangentially related to the plot, but actually the most entertaining of all the characters. Maybe it is following the Ice Age formula where the squirrel is the funniest character."
60,Happy Feet Two,6,30 December 2011,"Falls short of predecessor, but will still entertain the whole family.","Revolutionary dancing penguin Mumbles (Elijah Wood) is back, but now he and Gloria (Pink, replacing the late Brittany Murphy) are worried parents of Erik (Ava Acres), a little fur ball trying to find his way in life. The uplifting ""be yourself"" moral message is still present, however there's also an unwelcome caution about global warming that unnecessarily darkens the tone. Push that aside though and there's plenty of the trademark song and dance that made Happy Feet a surprise smash in 2006. The remixed (or is that penguinised?) tunes are enjoyable to bop along with, although by the elongated finale they start to wear thin and the complete lack of a story becomes more noticeable. Standout supporting character Ramon (Robin Williams) from the original isn't as funny this go round, so thankfully Brad Pitt and Matt Damon's odd couple krill, Will and Bill, pick up the slack with some hilarious scenes and dialogue. The law of diminishing returns is evident in this follow-up, yet it still delivers enough humour and toe-tapping entertainment to satisfy the whole family."
61,Happy Feet Two,10,11 December 2011,To those people who keep denying Happy Feet Two (Please Read),"I'm from Taiwan, I just came to USA 2 months ago. So sorry about my poor English, I still want to post my reviews though. My reviews might be too long but you will change your mind and won't regret reading this.I'm a fifteen-year-old girl. I've watched other people's reviews and some of them think that this is a disappointment of the original one. Maybe that's true, but you don't have to compare everything. You don't have to be too serious and have too much expectation about the movie. You can just watch it and feel happy and learn something from it. That's the purpose of this movie. Okay, if you still fell like it's bad, then you at least have known not to watch it next time. And some people say that this is a good movie if only they are 5-year-old children. No! I don't think so! Everyone used to be a child, and child has great imagination and a pure heart. Those are what most of adults don't and want to have. Who says people over 5 years old can't see and enjoy those cute and childish movies? Who doesn't miss their childhood? Who will refuse to be a child again just for a movie-long time? Oh, maybe some people, who don't even had a healthy and happy childhood, will refuse to do that. Poor them.Those two krill in the movie was impressive although they weren't the main characters. Some people say that they are unnecessary, but I don't think so. Krills are at the bottom of the food chain, but one of the krill in the movie didn't want to be plain. He wanted to have special experience. And he did it! Since they would died eventually, then why not just try what they want? So are we. Even once, it's worth. They also remind me the squirrel in the ""Ice Age"". Ha Ha.And the most impressive part for me was Eric singing for his dad and those seals. My mom and I both cried at that moment, and it was also the only part we cried. Eric sang about what Mumble taught him, and after he finished it he gave Mumble a big hug. How sweet! My heart was still touched after the end and even on my way home. I think the reason I cried was because Eric finally realized how hard Mumble tried to be a good father. They used to fight and Eric'd even rather to listen to a stranger's word than his father's (I was so angry then). Thank god they finally had a good father-son relationship and Eric finally found out he was good at singing an opera. This remind me to listen to my parents' warning because they are wiser than me.This is really a good movie. It will make you happy because the penguins are so cute and funny and you don't even have to see the 3D kind. Plus, if you think more after seeing it, you can learn something just like I did. It's not a movie just cute and cool but also has several invisible idea.About those people who keep denying Happy Feet Two, I just want to tell them : maybe you just don't like this movie, that's fine, but please don't influence other people who haven't seen this movie yet. You are taking away their chance to have a good time. Whether this movie is worth to see or not, they can check it by themselves. It's not that everybody will have the same opinion like you do."
62,Happy Feet Two,,21 November 2011,"A weak sequel, but still fun for the whole family","I watched this movie at a sneak preview in South Africa. I found the plot and script weak. The storyline was also weak and lacked originality. However, my school going kids enjoyed the movie. The music and animation is generally good. As a sequel trying to build on the success of the original, I do not see this movie making the grade. In the original movie Mumble, representing the Emperor penguin plight, had a genuine problem where the human population needed to be made aware of their impact on the environment. He achieved this by communicating through dance. In the original, the viewer easily decoded the message, that over-fishing in the Antarctic has dire consequences on the Antarctic ecosystem. The sequel however fails to convey its message, since the script and plot do not lead the audience in that direction. I think the message is got yo to do with global warming, maybe.I think 5/10 is a fair score."
63,Happy Feet Two,9,22 January 2012,Ignore the bad reviews it is unwarranted!,"Happy Feet 2 delivered on so many levels that I simply could not believe the negative comments on here.There was an extremely high cuteness factor,comedy,thrills,action,song and dance,beautiful animation and drama. (What more do you want?) Maybe a bit too much drama for some. But seeing how it ended it was very fitting.It reminded me of the classic disaster movies where obstacles had to overcome. And when they did it was like the best feeling ever. In that aspect it was a very old fashioned approach.(Yes people,nothing wrong with loving a feel good movie.) Unlike the first movie the hints towards the environment issues we face today were far more subtle and less darker. For someone who dislikes musicals I was loving this one.At least a lot of the songs made sense and served a purpose. Happy Feet 2 entertained me from the minute it started until the finish. And that is saying something because only a few movies have been able to do that in 2011. So please ignore the bad reviews,you won't regret it."
64,Happy Feet Two,10,28 November 2011,one word: disturbingly cute,"the penguins are put in life or death situations but its hard to be serious when their being all funny while being devoured by skuas. the 3d is actually good and i find it funny that Brad Pitt, a very famous actor is voicing a krill. the rapping penguin is very funny. I recommend this to anyone especially people who would like to see a penguins life in danger for a little excitement. overall the movie was a fun watch and is a awesome way to pass time. help. shh. i am being murdered splatter brain chunks everywhere guts slowly roping out into a small bloody hill of intestines... your next to be killed by the ripper..."
65,Happy Feet Two,10,26 November 2011,This was good.,"This was OK.When we heard there was another Happy Feet out we were really looking forward to it. Was looking forward to seeing this with kids. My kids loved it. i thought it could have been better though.But I do Love penguins, so that took the movie out.Lol. I do rather the first movie. However, hats off to the producers. To keep 4 year old bubbly twin girls occupied for over an hour is certainly a dream for any momma! I know my girls won't mind seeing it again either. I thought the plot could have been a little more fine tuned for an overall better finish. There were also parts that could have been funnier also. I give this review a 7 out of 10."
66,Happy Feet Two,4,27 November 2011,Nothing special,"The sequel to ""Happy Feet,"" the Academy Award®-winning animated smash hit, ""Happy Feet Two"" returns audiences to the magnificent landscape of Antarctica in superb 3D.""Happy Feet Two"" is directed by George Miller, who won an Oscar® as the creator of the original ""Happy Feet."" The film features the voices of Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Hank Azaria, Alecia Moore (P!nk), Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Sofia Vergara, Common, Hugo Weaving, Richard Carter, Magda Szubanski, Anthony LaPaglia and Benjamin ""Lil P-Nut"" Flores, Jr.For me, ""Happy Feet Two"" is pretty thin soup. The animation is bright and attractive, the music gives the characters something to do, but the movie has too much dialogue in the areas of philosophy and analysis.At the end it was boring but it was better than the first"
67,Happy Feet Two,6,13 November 2014,"As visually stunning as ever, but slightly lesser in the story department","The story this time around is a little more unfocused, with some superfluous characters, but the animation is just as impressive and voice cast is expanded in this sequel to the Academy Award-winning HAPPY FEET. In HAPPY FEET TWO, Mumble and Gloria have a son Erik who is having difficulty finding his place in the community. Will he sing? Will he dance? He doesn't know. Meanwhile, shifting Arctic ice traps the majority of the Emperor penguin colony and Mumble goes to off to find help. What I noticed as different this time was that there wasn't as much singing/dancing. This was an element that really enriched the first one and made me enjoy it a little more. The story in this sequel had less of that, and at times was a little dull and borderline depressing. Still, there is a happy ending because, you know, it's a kid's movie. Also, while it was nice to have a larger cast full of recognizable voices, a couple of the characters they play were largely unnecessary and distracting to the overall story-line. The two biggest offenders, despite how entertaining they were to watch, were Brad Pitt and Matt Damon as two krill. Why were they in the movie? Who knows? They never interacted with the main story in any meaningful way, and just seemed like an excuse to get a couple more big-name actors on the marquee. A little more understandable in terms of the themes is the inclusion of a puffin named Sven, who can fly. His primary function is to provide inspiration and guidance to Erik although, as penguins (and the audience) already know, they can't fly even if they wanted to. Despite the character being somewhat unneeded, Hank Azaria did a great job voicing him. The rest of the voice cast, some of which were replacements (Common for Fat Joe, and P!nk for Brittany Murphy), also did a good job, but P!nk was probably the least compelling of them all. She's a decent singer, but her acting could definitely use some work. Overall, the film was slightly less entertaining than its predecessor, but nonetheless enjoyable in its own right."
68,Happy Feet Two,5,14 September 2014,"Bright, loud, brash, and a bit of a mess","Mumble the penguin and Gloria have a son Erik. All the penguins are now dancing but Erik is struggling to get the hang of it. All around them, the ice is melting. Erik and his friends Bodicea and Atticus goes off to follow Ramon (Robin Williams). They arrive at Adélie-Land led by The Mighty Sven who can fly and is actually a puffin. Sven and Lovelace survived an oil slice to be rescued by humans. They escaped to rule the Adélie penguins. Mumble goes and retrieves the three little guys. However a giant upheaval blocks off and traps all the Emperor penguins. Meanwhile, there is a couple of krills (Brad Pitt, Matt Damon) trying to find their place in the world.It is loud. It is brash. It's even more colorful than the first one. However the story is a rambling mess. They're trying to incorporate human climate change, have people, other animal characters and even introduces a side story about krills. It's too much and leaves a story without cohesion. Having Brad Pitt and Matt Damon as krill friends may be funny on paper, but it's tough to realize that it is actually Pitt and Damon. The voice work isn't unique enough to make that connection. It probably needs a lot of inside modern references to make that connection. Although they provide some interesting comedy."
69,Happy Feet Two,4,30 December 2013,Lacking story,"Stunning visuals and beautiful animation, but the story is flimsy and incoherent. Half an hour in it still doesn't quite know which direction to go.Happy Feet Two has some good moments. I really enjoyed the part when Sven was introduced. I thought the film would revolve around him and Erik more. It's obvious Erik adores Sven, while being upset with his father. That's a perfect foundation for a good story, but this direction is never really explored. Instead the film shifts its focus entirely when the huge ice sheet imprisons the other emperor penguins. I thought that was odd.What's even odder are the krill. The film spends so much time on them, yet they never really come into contact with any character of importance. What was the point having them at all? It just adds to the film's lack of direction.I was disappointed in this sequel. It feels like the story has so many fundamental problems that should have been easily spotted during the drafting phase. It's a mystery to me how they decided to go with this. What a waste of excellent animation and image quality."
70,Happy Feet Two,,16 August 2012,"A bit of a let-down after 'Happy Feet', not as interesting a story.","'Happy Feet' was about the little penguin who didn't have the singing talent all others of his species had, instead he was a natural dancer, a wonderful dancer.Elijah Wood is back as the voice of Mumble but the story is much different. There is one about a Puffin bird who claims he is a penguin, and flies, and tells the others they can too if they 'believe.' The bigger overall story is about a large ice cave-in that traps most of the colony so that they can't get food. Mumble has to enlist the help of some elephant seals to free them.But my favorite characters were the tiny krill, Brad Pitt as Will the Krill and Matt Damon as Bill the Krill. After they narrowly escape a feeding whale Will the Krill decides that he wants a better life, he will 'evolve' into a meat-eater. His attempts don't exactly work out the way he wants them to. But they too eventually help save the stranded penguins. The dialog between Will and Bill is very witty and funny.Sadly Brittany Murphy died after the first 'Happy Feet' where she was the voice of Gloria. The singer known as 'Pink' takes over that role and does a superb job, and her singing of several songs added greatly.Overall a cute and mostly entertaining movie, but not up to the entertainment level of the first one."
71,Happy Feet Two,5,20 July 2012,Level of awesomeness: Crustacean,"I LOVED the original Happy Feet (I gave it score 10/10), so I went to see this sequel with BIG expectation. Simply said, it didn't deliver. The feeling was too different, at a point I even thought that it might had been directed by different people. The songs (which was one the of the many reasons I loved the original Happy Feet) were terrible, the premise neither strong or clear enough, and the first 5 minutes introduction failed to capture the heart of the original Happy Feet. The crustacean part seems to be more of a meaningless filler that has nothing to do with the plot, annoying to say the least. They tried to be funny with it, but the result is far from succeeded. The black and white scenes to picture human-related flashback was badly executed and felt misplaced. I said it but I say it again: the songs were dull and not catchy. The kids were cute but not comparable to little Mumble and little Gloria. The overall atmosphere were gloomy (despite the humorous attempt) and heavy. The first Happy Feet also has gloominess and a certain heaviness to it, but those came much later. And even while in uncertainty, the original Happy Feet managed to stay fun and light. I must say that the sequel's missing the heart of the prequel."
72,Happy Feet Two,7,14 July 2012,"Good movie, but I liked the first one better","Even though I'm way over the hill, I enjoyed the first Happy Feet movie. The originality, visual impact, music, story and technical aspects all worked for me. I thought it was movie magic. One aspect of the first movie that I really liked in particular was that at the start I felt like I was watching a penguin documentary. And in that movie the song and dance number that was done at the appearance of the Aurora Australis was fantastic. That was the best part.I saw this sequel on the tube though. I suppose that's one reason why it didn't work so well for me.In general, it's always difficult for the sequel of an original movie to outshine the original.Don't get me wrong: this movie had most of the good stuff from the original film - and more. I suppose the problem was that the themes and ideas no longer seemed so original. The story line seemed less interesting, the characters less engaging. The plot was a little forced and too busy, the message a little too confused. I didn't experience a ""magic"" moment akin to the one I felt with the Aurora scene.Also, it disturbed me to see the devastation of the Antarctic portrayed so starkly in this film. I can't watch nature shows depicting this either. It felt like an environmental disaster cartoon to me. If you're going to show us how much we've destroyed the earth, it will only appeal to me if it's done with a fairly light hand and there's some sense of hope at the end. It was laid on too thick.Not that this movie isn't worth seeing. It is, particularly for the visuals and the music. But for those of you who saw the first film, this one is not as good as the original. I hope the producers and writers are willing to make a third movie, perhaps this time exploring their Happy Feet universe in a new and fresh way. Look at Toy Story. The third movie was the best of them all.And next time I'll do my best to see it in the theatre, in 3D if possible."
73,Happy Feet Two,5,12 July 2012,A long lasting wound from ANIMATION films.,"Both the films were a disappointment from me. The first one was more depressing than this one. However the only thing I found cogent in this was the story line was somewhat reasonable. The first part was utterly disgusting. What I think now the primary reason for my disliking the film to be the dancing along with those irritating voices of singing songs together. The film cannot be liked by a mass audience and can be liked by a special category only. Looking on the positive side it is unquestionable that the animated penguins looked to be lifelike. I have not seen such lifelike characters before. All in all for me this dancing musical series is a great disappointment for animation fans.""Watch at your own risk."""
74,Happy Feet Two,2,4 June 2012,Didn't even keep my toddlers happy.,"When I was unsubtly hit over the head with three (3!) different ""messages"" in the first fifteen minutes, I was worried. As soon as the popcorn ran out, my three year old wandered out of the room, and actually put herself down for a nap, rather than finish watching. (She hates naps. And she was the one who picked out this movie.) That really had me worried. My four year old son left not long after his sister, to go play in his room. My wife and I finished watching the movie, and at the end, I was struck mainly by how much was wrong with it. There's the fact that it doesn't even seem to know what point it wants to make. Should I be an original? Is it okay to be different? Are people evil and ruining the planet? And all of these themes are approached with a total ham-fisted lack of care. And speaking of a lack of care, the music was basically chosen at random, tossed into a blender, and then crammed into the movie, seemingly at random. Gone was the masterful interweaving of various genres seamlessly into the film. This was more like somebody learning how iMovie works. There was an entire second story going on which A) had nothing to do with the first (until the end, when it was crammed into the second and glued together using the uneven environmental message the film pretended wasn't a real agenda.) And B) was far superior. Frankly, I think I could have watched a whole movie based upon the krill. The penguin portion meandered around without a real plot for quite awhile, and it retcons the first film repeatedly. Mumble has more down than he did at the end of the first film (and he should have lost all of it by now) the Adelie penguins claim singing is foolish in the first, but have no issues with it at all in the second, etc, etc. And then, about halfway through, **SPOILER ALERT** (but not really because, by the time you make it this far, you probably don't care anymore) the film reverses the ""Mankind is bad, and is screwing up Nature, by having Nature stop men from saving the penguins.**END OF SPOILERS** Seriously, there is more wrong with this movie than right. My advice, watch the first one again, and imagine what the sequel should have been. Yours will be better."
75,Happy Feet Two,6,22 March 2012,Sad tone of the story isn't buying me!,"Generally,Animated films are child oriented carrying positive tone appealing to both children and adult audiences.Unlike Happy Feet 1,majority of the movie runs through the incidents which brings out negative emotions in the main characters as wall as audiences.-SPOILER- I couldn't get this thing ,during the climax , the winter hits Emperor land suddenly , when sea gets frozen but the very next day everything is back to normal sunny again.How can that be possible?(Yeah you can take cinematic liberties but...) Highlights: 1.Technical aspects and visual effects of the movie 2.The song 'Under Pressure' 3.Erick the penguin (Ohh he looks cute)Downers: 1.Storyline 2.Weak characterization of Krills. They doesn't seem to fit in.Overall a big disappointment compared to the first part which I liked very much."
76,Happy Feet Two,4,19 March 2012,Not Fish nor ...,"I have to admit that I was a little bit disappointed in the movie overall. It did check almost every box and it seems to have a sense of an overall storyline (with a subplot coming into play), but it doesn't feel like that. It seems to want more than it can achieve. Plus there are the odd (singing) moments (especially Pinks song does not feel like it belongs in there ... her singing is actually great and I like the song, but it kinda took me out of it).The subplot that I mentioned feels weird too. It seems to try to put out a message, but instead it delivers a weird mixture of mixed messages and a plot push that feels exactly like that. I'm not sure if the little ones will mind, but if they can choose, I'm sure they'll want a better picture than this. And I do love penguins ... maybe that's why I gave it a 4"
77,Happy Feet Two,5,13 March 2012,Visually stunning in 3D and some great music,"Not as good as the original though. There's nothing to care about plot wise. The amazing 3D visuals and great music throughout doesn't make up for the story feeling so contrived and heavy handed. The Krill side story seemed like a time filler, with no point at all. The Krill jokes got old fast. Hank Azaria as The Mighty Sven was a show stealer. Funny when he starts Numa Numa says it's Finnish, even﻿ though its in Romanian.. Still funny.Have to say though the 3D effects are amazing, on par with Legend of the Guardians. If you have a 3D TV this is a must watch just for the graphics."

79,Happy Feet Two,10,25 December 2011,The best animated movie of 2011,"I loved the first happy feet and i have always hoped for a sequel that could do the impossible and beat it... and boy did happy feet 2 beat it. I have to say to all the haters out their that all your doing is nitpicking because u didn't want to like it. The story here is amazing as it tells the story of how mumble is coping being a dad to... well THE CUTEST BABY PENGUIN EVER!! and how global warming is impacting on the penguins.The visuals are outstanding and deserve Oscar praise. As does P!NKS groundbreaking song ""Bridge of Light"" which could have been the most heartfelt and aw inspiring part of the movie (if not then the finale which is also spectacular)George Miller should be so proud of this movie as i am to say its Australian. And the intertwining story between the penguins and the krill is so clever and it ads a great fresh feel to the new addition. And if it will happen i greatly anticipate Happy Feet 3.Bravo George, you have given us something to think about as well as an amazing movie that will live on for years. Thankyou."
