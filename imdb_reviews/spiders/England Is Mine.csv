0,England Is Mine,8,5 August 2017,One for the fans,"At last, a musical biopic that doesn't throw in cheap references, nor equally cheap laughs, and instead gives us a sober, realistic and not always warm character study of the formative years of one of Britain's best loved singer-songwriters. But be warned - if you have no interest in Steven Patrick Morrissey, indeed if you have a passing love for the band and aren't too bothered in learning how he came up with the lyrics that he did, then much of ENGLAND IS MINE might not do a lot for you. This film is definitely one for the proper fans, and for those of us in that position it's a real treat. Lots to love about this one. Jack Lowden might not look a lot like Morrissey but he gets across very well the sense of alienation and perpetual disappointment that surrounds our hero. He's bored and unfulfilled with every aspect of his life, feeling like there's something more out there and yet too shy and not forthcoming enough to go after it. That lack of belonging is something many young people experience - I know I did - and Morrissey is kind of the Dean of that time in life, and Lowden nails it. His friendship with Linder (fantastic Jessica Brown Findlay) shows him finding a rare kindred spirit, and he reacts to the lost chance of success he arrives at briefly with Adam Lawrence's Billy Duffy by doing what we would all like to and retreating to his bedroom.The period detail is excellent - you get the vision of late 70s/early 80s Manchester as a bit of a dive, crammed with lost souls and angry voices, from which Morrissey feels entirely apart. Lovely touches, like the cracked, single pane windows upon which rain hammers, add to to reality. The choice of musical numbers is another bonus. There are no Smiths tracks, given the tale essayed here takes place before the band was formed. Instead we get the 1960s songs that heavily influenced the group's sound, and that's a real bonus. The era before the Smiths existed really feels like another place, another time, bereft of something that they ended up filling. One nice bit of detail, the local venue that exhibits posters for an upcoming Duran Duran concert while Morrissey and Marr (Laurie Kynaston, not in it much) start hammering out the more localised and altogether grittier music and lyrics that would eventually form the Smiths, a great snatch of visual storytelling that the film stuffs in. And if you aren't interested in that, there's the gallows humour of young Mozzer to enjoy, an acerbic wit that would put people off and yet find expression in his words put to Marr's tunes."
1,England Is Mine,5,2 July 2017,An interesting character study of a pre-Smiths Morrissey.,"I was lucky enough to attend the world premier of this at the Edinburgh Film festival closing gala. Now to the actual movie. The story is focused on Morrissey towards the end of the 70s and the struggles he had trying to get his first foot on the ladder as a performer while at the same time being paralyzed with fear of being on stage and dealing with his everyday struggles. In the movie he comes across as a hyper sensitive and shy person but with an underlying streak of arrogance in his own belief in his abilities,despite his lack of confidence in social situations. However the acerbic one liners you would expect from Morrissey are there and when they arrive they are genuine laugh out loud funny. If Smiths fans were hoping to see a film which has a lot of Smiths music in it they will be disappointed. Its similar to the James Brown biopic there's none of the music you may have anticipated being part of the story, which may be a problem for some fans. What we do hear is mostly pop music from the charts from that time. The cast do a great job however without dropping any spoilers for me the film ended almost at the point it was about to get even more interesting, though I doubt there will be any sequel. The film is an interesting character study of one the UKs greatest ever front men from one of the best bands the country has produced, however I am not sure that this film is something either he or his fans will take to their heart. I feel there is a better film on this subject yet to be made. Interesting from as a psychological study but fans may feel shortchanged."
2,England Is Mine,6,20 September 2017,This Film Isn't A Morrissey Biopic; So Cool Your Heals Mozza-Manics,"I can encapsulate working class Manchester of this time in one sentence: Cigarette burns in bus seats with the smell of stale urine in the air.I like what's been done here. The Smiths (& Morrissey himself) create such devotion in fans (especially those who were there at the time) that any conceived wrong foot in a film relating to that band would be gnawed upon by a multitude of bedroom martyrs; especially in this internet age.Nevertheless, what the film makers have done with England Is Mine sidesteps this problem, for they've made a film not about MORRISSEY, but rather Stephen (Steve) Morrissey - a young Mancunian man suffering from depression within in a time & area of depression; The Smiths aren't even a whiff away.It's hard to emphasis to those who didn't experience it, how gray Manchester of the 70s & early 80s was. It was stuck in a polluted puddle of red brick decay, unsure & struggling to break free from its own shadow. In many ways this film (consciously or not) reflects young Steven Morrissey against Manchester of that time. No clich√© in sight.P.S. It is slighting disconcerting how much the lead looks like the English comedy actor Alan Davies in the first half of the film."
3,England Is Mine,8,8 August 2017,a film for the fans!!!,"to start off with, if you're going into this film hoping to see plenty of smiths songs and smiths related stuff, you're going to be disappointed. however this film is a realistic, enlightening and well made insight into a young, socially awkward yet likable Stephen Patrick Morrissey, trying to get his voice heard in the cramped music scene of the 1970/80s. Jack Lowden (Morrissey) who may not really look a lot like Morrissey, does a excellent job of portraying all of his unique characteristics and making him likable in the processes.as a massive smiths fan I was of course disappointed at the absence of any smiths songs, however the music was still very good, using a lot of mid 70s tracks, which is sure to give a lot of older fans nostalgia. the only problem I found was that I originally knew this would obviously be a dramatization like most film biographies, but I then found out later that this is an unauthorized film, meaning that all of this could of possibly been false information, which is a bit of a waste of an hour and a half if it is.altogether though it was a very well made film with lots of style and memorable performances. hopefully a follow-up will be made in the future which focuses more on the smiths and their road to becoming one of the most recognizable bands ever made."
4,England Is Mine,,8 January 2018,"Just watched ""England Is Mine"": heaven knows I'm miserable now","""England Is Mine"" isn't a movie about Morrissey (the actor doesn't even look like him) or The Smiths. If you're looking for a film about them, you won't find it here (besides, like many other movies about real musicians, this one wasn't allowed to use real music either).Who has not looked for a job and, at the same time, was afraid to find it? Who has not preferred to do anything instead of risking doing something for fear of succeeding? These, among a few others, seem to be the main questions of this film. It doesn't offer any answer, however.If you want to see a guy rejecting all the women that are given to him, this is a movie for you.The film could've been better."
5,England Is Mine,,12 January 2018,A Wikipedia Page in Film,"What a disappointing pile of garbage. This film could have been so much more but all it did was take a few key events from wikipedia and make a movie.
""If you have five seconds to spare, then I'll tell you the story of my life / Sixteen, clumsy and shy / That's the story of my life.""
The film was Clumsy in the making, shy in the facts and was a waste of more than 5 seconds of my life."
6,England Is Mine,10,4 August 2017,A rainy day film soaked in Morrissey,"Everything you would expect of a pre-Smiths life of Morrissey, dank, a depressing struggle with life, rain, poetry, a little humour, some nice philosophy, a typewriter, a box bedroom wannabe/soon to be, a record player and records set in some 70's and 80's nostalgia. It felt like a cute calm film before a storm of a Smiths film to follow,hopefully.No spoilers from me here other than he doesn't die at the end but in the next film (please) goes on to create the Smiths."
7,England Is Mine,9,12 January 2018,Morrissey is not Hollywood!,"I guess people give this movie a crappy review because it's not your average Hollywood movie. It's not a Hollywood movie. It rises above that. It makes you work a bit, and it lasts long when you return to the music of Morrissey. I loved the music of The Smiths and Morrissey in the 80s and 90s. I was just a kid. The music was cool and it bombarded the airwaves. As I grew older, I paid much more attention to the lyrics and was surprised how arrogant, cynical, and depressing the lyrics could be. As a kid, I just liked the melodies of songs like ""Ask"" ""There is a Light That Never Goes Out"" and ""Girlfriend in a Coma"". I liked Morrissey's voice too. After paying more attention to the lyrics, I had much more respect for the music. It is bloody brilliant. With respect to what Morrissey brought to the music with his lyrics and smooth crooning, this movie attempts to dig deep into the soul of Steven Patrick Morrissey, which is a daring venture, considering his worldwide droves of competing and critical followers. I believe this movie accomplished its goal. The naysayers will argue that the movie is boring and vague, or that the filmmaker's representation is unflattering and noxious to the legend that is Morrissey. To them I can only say, ""Go back and listen to the lyrics that create a window through which you might understand who Steven Patrick Morrissey was and really is."""
8,England Is Mine,6,19 December 2017,Morrissey Before Morrissey,"Fans of popular music know that the tunes change with the times and so do the tastes of those listening. What was once popular suddenly falls out of grace and the next big thing is introduced. Over the years a person can alter their preferences and that's fine, never leaving behind completely what they once enjoyed. That being said exposure to new music is a must for the real music lover.The 60s had brought us the pop sound as delivered by the Beatles. The 70s had two genres, disco which is now hated (yet still exists) and punk which while influential really wasn't around all that long. Then in the 80s we had the synthesized music of power pop. So those bands would be the ones considered most influential right? Wrong. Read any blog, book or article and what many consider to be the most influential band of the time is The Smiths.For myself I never heard much by the band until decades later. So to read they were considered the most influential band in polls and their albums were among the top 500 in Rolling Stone Magazines poll kind of surprised me. Though since it was RS perhaps it shouldn't have since they rarely choose the most popular music to promote. But in reading about the bad after watching ENGLAND IS MINE it brought a better understanding of the film to me.Steven Morrissey (Jack Lowden) is a young man growing up in Manchester, England in the 70s. Withdrawn and a loner, he goes out to listen to music at night and then posts his reviews in the local music newspapers. His father wants him to get a job, his mother wants him to follow his passion for writing and he...well he doesn't quite know what he wants to do.A friend eggs him on to pursue his passion for writing, especially the poetry he puts forth. He writes constantly in booklets that he carries with him everywhere. But he can't seem to figure out the outlet to let lose his words. Instead he takes an office job where he continues to be picked on by co-workers and is bullied by his boss. He hates it but has to make a living.On his nights out he meets Linder Sterling (Jessica Brown Findlay), a college student and aspiring artist who thinks he's one of the more insightful writers when it comes to his views on music. They strike up a friendship and are inseparable. Until Linder has the opportunity to move to London to pursue her dreams. She encourages Steven to do the same and he finally breaks down and joins with local guitarist Billy Duffy (Adam Lawrence) to start writing songs.His shyness and inability to be comfortable in social situations continues to plague Steven preventing him from performing. But a final push results in his finally taking the stage and discovering he actually enjoys it. But things happen that throw his life into another downward spiral. Yes, we viewers know what became of Steven Morrissey but the film allows us a behind the scenes glimpse of how he got there.Fans of The Smiths won't be thrilled with this film. The movie offers little to none of their music and barely touches on their existence. Instead its focus is on Morrissey himself and what brought about his journey to live performing and how his life experiences were what were the basis of the words he brought to the table. One almost feels as if there could be a trilogy of films about his life beginning with this one, moving to his time with The Smiths and ending with his solo career.The controversies, the legal battles and the popularity of Morrissey's life are not even touched on in this film. Instead we remain in those formative years. While watching I kept wondering about the film. All biopics tend to play it fast and loose with the facts. Here we see his mother supporting him in every way imaginable. If that was the reality then the woman should be hailed for being one of the best mothers out there.The performances by all are well done and leave you hoping to see more from all of the cast members here, none standing out above the rest. While Lowden may be the star and center of attention he leaves room for the other actors to play with and off of his character. He does a great job of changing his physical appearance from the start to the finish and with each new incarnation his mannerisms change as well. But to offer that sort of performance while still being generous to your co-stars is something worth noting.Filled with plenty of music from the 60s and 70s that influenced Morrissey the only thing lacking are those Smith's tunes. But since his formation of the group is only glimpsed in the final scene it is not to be.One thing I found interesting and will note is the montage at the end of the film. Director Mark Gill takes us shot by shot to the various sets and location scenes where the entire story took place, unoccupied by characters or people at all. It makes you focus on all that has come before, each place having a special meaning in the life of the character. It was a nice touch that brings the entire thing around and helps the viewer to focus. All in all a good movie and one fans of Morrissey will enjoy."
9,England Is Mine,,7 January 2018,The negative of what could've been............,"A film/docudrama about the early days of The Smiths/Morrissey. When this is set, in the late 70's, if you took a photograph and had it developed you would have got a photo and a negative copy. This film is like the negative of the events. It's like the uninteresting part of something special...... and don't get me wrong . The Smiths were special, in every sense of the word. Shame, what could have been.........."
10,England Is Mine,8,23 December 2017,Tedious... as it should be!,"My criteria for movies:Do I believe the characters? Yes.
Do I care about the characters? Yes
Do I believe the story? Yes
Do I care about the story? AbsolutelyI struggled a little through the first half of the movie, finding it tedious, slow, and a little difficult to become engaged in. As I watched, however, I realized that this is Morrissey we're talking about -- someone whom one of the indie/alternative radio stations in America constantly referred to as ""Miserable Morrissey"". Very slowly, but surely, everything began to make sense in Morrissey's environment and how his experience shaped him into one of the great lyricists of pop music: No way out of the drab working class existence, with a local music scene that says nothing to anybody about their lives, and simply a unique person trying to fit in to a type-cast world. From that backdrop, Morrissey finds some semblance of salvation in poetry and music, friends and family.I suspect the low IMDB score -- currently 6.1 out of 10 -- may in part be due to the slow pace and the fact that Morrissey almost never smiles. But that's what's so good about the movie -- in the final analysis, it makes me a believer.The Smiths-less soundtrack is excellent as is the cinematography, the latter adding to the gloomy, grey, drab feel of life in Manchester and its working class. The poetic element, where Morrissey and his friend frequently practice their poetic chops together complements the soundtrack perfectly well.""England is mine"" has its flaws here and there, but nothing so significant as to tarnish a very good, captivating movie. 8 of 10."
