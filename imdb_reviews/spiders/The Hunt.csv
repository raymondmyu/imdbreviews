0,The Hunt,10,3 October 2012,"Emotionally draining but truly moving ""ripped from the headlines"" story","""The Hunt"" is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.To delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I'll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I'll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.This is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen's delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won't be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp's portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she's in.The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children's emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.This is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund's score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer's imagination, which chill to the bone.Hollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn't matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.""The Hunt"" was easily the saddest film I've seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It's a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that's both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.It was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but ""The Hunt"" is one of the most affecting and emotional films I've ever seen and one of the best of 2012."
1,The Hunt,10,17 October 2012,Fantastic and compelling,"I went to see this as part of the London Film Festival on Monday. I have to say that two days later it still resonates in my mind. Yes, it's a common tale that has been told in cinema before(man is wrongly accused and ostracised), but never so well, in my eyes. The acting is first class with no exception and the cinematography is perfect, creating a tense mood throughout the film. It's not for the faint hearted, but I think it's an important subject matter and very current. I've often wondered what it must be like for someone wrongly accused of such a crime and the hysteria that surrounds it. I have read reviews that say this is unrealistic but I don't agree, I only have to look on my own front doorstep in England to see exactly the same sort of behaviour, often far far more intense.I highly recommend it."
2,The Hunt,10,5 December 2012,A film for those who stupidly believe there's no smoke without fire.,"Sometimes children lie.  Sometimes good people give in to hysteria, and lose all sense of  reason.  Sometimes they destroy innocent lives.  The Hunt (aka Jagten) is the latest offering from Denmark that will  knock you sideways. Forget the thrill of TV dramas The Killing, Borgen  and The Bridge, Thomas Vinterberg's film is a shocking, harrowing  experience that will affect you profoundly and will live in your mind  for a very long time. The Hunt is for those who don't need to 'enjoy' a  film to regard it as valid and who are not afraid to step into the  darkness of the injustice and judgment of which we are all capable.  More than that, it is a film for those who stupidly believe there is no  smoke without fire.  Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a lonely teacher, divorced from his wife,  kept apart from his son and devoted to the young children in his care  at the nursery and within the community. He is a genuinely good man who  has earned the respect of his peers, the love of a new girlfriend and  the trust of the children who leap out of hedges to wrestle him and be  chased around the playground by him.  Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), the daughter of his best friend, Theo  (Thomas Bo Larsen) has an innocent, childish crush on Lucas when two  situations occur in quick succession. Firstly she is exposed to an  explicit pornographic image and, secondly, Lucas gently chastises her  for inappropriate behavior towards him. With a fertile imagination,  childish indignation and no comprehension of the consequences, Klara  makes an accusation against Lucas and his world implodes.  For only the fifth time so far this year, I believe I have witnessed a  near-perfect film. The Hunt is complete due to the tight screenplay,  the sensitivity of Vinterberg's direction and the performances from  principal and peripheral actors alike that are always absorbing and  frequently astounding.  Mikkelsen must certainly be the focal point of any review. His  performance as Lucas causes the stomach to tighten and the back tingle  as we wonder How would I react? In much the same way that Colin Firth's  George crumpled when receiving the news of his partner's death in A  Single Man, so Mikkelsen's Lucas is silently crushed as he is told that  accusations have been made. Lucas suffers the physical and emotional  wounds of slander and revenge for an act he cannot conceive and of  which he has less knowledge than those who condemn and attack him.  Equally, both Larsen and Anne Louise Hassing as Klara's parents  carefully unwrap the turmoil any parent would suffer upon hearing their  young child has suffered sexual abuse. It is a challenge not to yell at  the screen ""Don't be so stupid,"" or to scream expletives at Grethe  (Susse Wold) the head teacher who loses her grip on both duty and  reason and germinates the hatred and judgment that follow. As Lucas'  son, Marcus, Lasse Fogelstrøm gives a heartfelt performance segueing  seamlessly from courage to hurt to desperation and anger and his  distress is a warning to those given over to rumours.  The surprise, no, the absolute shock, with the casting is Wedderkopp.  In an adult with twenty years experience on the big screen it would be  a breathtaking performance; that this is the debut of a young child is  staggering. She is entirely believable as the girl with the vivid  imagination and understandable lack of foresight who is lead by  over-enthusiastic adults and suffers her own punishment of confusion  alone.  The tragedy within The Hunt is explicit and unavoidable. The external  tragedy is that it will probably not feature on most To See lists  because it is both foreign and that the explosions are emotional rather  than physical. Although it is Denmark's entry for Best Film in a  Foreign Language for the Oscars, I suspect both Mikkelsen and Vinterbeg  will be completely overlooked in their own right as with the principals  of Beasts of the Southern Wild. Thank goodness for the BAFTAS and Mark  Kermode! The events depicted in The Hunt are utterly horrific. Don't  sit in front of the screen expecting a light, easy, thought provoking  flick. I emerged numb, angry, helpless and terrified. But for one  careless or cruel comment, it could happen to me.  Or you."
3,The Hunt,9,12 October 2012,"Excellent, moving film","I saw this movie yesterday. I agree with previous reviewers, this is an excellent, moving, wonderfully acted movie. It is impossible I think to go through it without being brought to tears at one point or another. You also feel like screaming at some characters sometimes - ""what are you doing? Open your eyes! Listen!"" But the great thing is you always understand where each character is coming from- you might not agree with their actions, but nothing they do feels forced or unrealistic. Mikkelsen is amazing in this. I had seen him in a few movies before, and always thought highly of him, but here he is just incredible. It's a tough subject matter, and the movie does not shy away from it, but at the same time it is not vulgar or ""in your face"", it's tactful. I really loved it."
4,The Hunt,10,16 April 2013,The narrative's genius embeds observer-effect with great accuracy  unforgettable masterpiece.,"Consider first the setting. It may be quiet and idyllic, but merry laughter and droll humour open the scene. A group of middle-aged manboys are clowning around by the lake. They are long-time friends of The Hunt's central character, Lucas  bespectacled 42 year old ex-professor, recently divorced and too old to be waddling in the water like a toddler at playtime.But the time is November in this unknown Danish village and everyone is having a good time in yet another get-together. Friends have known each other for years, people know people on a first name basis, many have lived here for generations and Lucas, is just another face in this jolly, close-knit community  nondescript and mellow, respected and well-liked.We are told that Lucas (played with artful and refined precision by Mads Mikkelsen) is not without the woes that come with modern adult life. Living alone and seeking custody of teenage son Marcus (newcomer Lasse Fogelstrøm), he is an ordinary man trying to rebuild from ground up as a kindergarten teacher. Immediately you can see that he is kind and friendly because Lucas walks young Klara home, and chats with her father, also his best friend, Theo. The two men share lasagne while fussing over pet dogs and hunting rifles. You acknowledge that Lucas has earned his place in this neighbourhood and relationships are in complete accord. Then the maiming of his middle-class existence begins.Klara develops a schoolgirl crush and puerile gestures are sensibly rebuffed. Nothing unpredictable or startling at this point. You've heard of such awkward incidents before. But Lucas is then accused of something he did not commit because Klara said something to avenge an earlier rejection.This is where The Hunt succeeds with penetrating insights into social phenomenon  soon after she causes harm, Klara attempts to recant the accusation without success. Here, writer-director Thomas Vinterberg absolves Klara from absolute blame and sets the stage for unreasonable and sinister conclusions. Watching the film from here on out is an unforgettable and riveting experience.It is natural to assume The Hunt simply alludes to the concept of ""Witch Hunt"", and contents itself with being dramatized fiction about falsely accusing the innocent. But if that were so, the brilliant scene where Klara was interviewed would not have alarmed with its disturbing methodology. The narrative's genius embeds observer-effect with great accuracy and insight into expectations of Klara, and her subsequent reaction. Vinterberg denies us simple solutions in which adults are perceptive enough to decipher the truth. For example, Ole the counsellor, ushered in from an unknown organization is scruffy and slightly unkempt. Characteristically unlikeable, he wears an implicit stereotype on his face and contaminates Klara's testimony by coaxing with a few hints, ""Do you remember, if something white came out?""She stares blankly, yet revulsion grows and collective hysteria spreads  allowing The Hunt to unveil itself as a carefully executed masterpiece. The clues match only because suggestive prompts are pushing the limits of disturbing reality.The canvas is visually precise; casting is pitch-perfect (especially that of Annika Wedderkopp in her excellent portrayal of Klara) and the script is cautiously penned.Based on transcripts of police interrogations conducted on suspected paedophiles in Denmark, the US and several European countries; Vinterberg investigates cause-effect with chilling authenticity. There is no doubt that The Hunt is antithesis to ""Festen"", an earlier work depicting the same subject matter but don't be mistaken  this film does not involve itself with controversial material for the sake of obligatory endorsements. Relentless and intense plot is enriched by characters reacting with protective instincts that come naturally simply because they care for one another. We see the internal worlds of Lucas, Theo, Marcus and Klara, and observe the impact of rotten dynamic unfolding before our very eyes. This forces us, spectators with an omniscient view to sit-up and question judgement using rational exactitude.Short analysis of the ending >>> The Hunt is a superb, penetrating study of human agency and in the end, some mysteries remain unknowable. There are several narratives attempting to interpret the final scene, and who the shooter really is. This person may very well be the same culprit who killed Fanny. Is it Klara's older brother, who has demonstrated protectiveness over her? Perhaps a disgruntled retail assistant from the grocery store? Maybe a figment of Lucas's anxious imagination from knowing life can easily cast him from the status of a hunter to that of a prey?These questions continue to linger because The Hunt's technical finish is open-form and resists finite closure. The image of an unknown rifleman, indistinct and in hiding is a conveyor of figurative conclusions. By doing such, Vinterberg employs artistic device to suggest that attitudes may be outwardly placid, but remain violent and embittered covertly. Just as it is with real life, some hostility can't be neutralized and a malevolent presence continues to loom over the horizon, willing to perpetuate an abyss of moral panic.https://cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com"
5,The Hunt,10,24 March 2013,"This is a Film with a capital ""F""","I've been an IMDb user for several years. Still, this is my first review. After watching this Film, I just felt the urge to praise it. So here it is: thanks to the writer, director, actors and all those who created this masterpiece. It really has the power to convey real feelings to the watcher. Even though I kept telling to myself it was just a movie, it still made me care for the characters.It's a shame that such Films are not promoted as they should be. I am so sorry I had no idea about Danish cinematography until now. This movie will make stay alert for any new Danish production and look for older ones in a desperate try to recover what you could've experienced instead of all the commercial movie offer of Hollywood."
6,The Hunt,9,6 March 2013,Who would have thought a Danish Art House film could be so thoroughly gripping?,"'The Hunt' is a truly accomplished film, its simple premise and themes are executed perfectly. The film is hugely engrossing and completely and utterly infuriating, which is a testament to the merits of its acting, direction, script and hyper-realism.The film follows Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), a lonely primary school teacher who relishes his job and is popular with both the children and the local community. Just as he meets Nadja (Alexandra Rapaport) and begins a relationship with her, his relationship with another woman, 5-year-old Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), lands him in immeasurable trouble. What happens is a completely innocuous misunderstanding, but the community, the 'adults' who are supposed to be rational and fair, turn into a lynch mob.The film is about the danger of mass-hysteria, ignorance and subsequently the frightening power of numbers. It teaches the importance of measure and consideration; it's a much needed anecdote to the sensational vilification, general ignorance and trashy media that permeates our lives.It's the scare-mongering, amoral tabloids that help in empowering the dangerously ignorant lynch-mobs that arise whenever someone screams 'paedophile!' or 'woman beater!' These lynch-mobs normally consist of pugnacious, dreadful people who enjoy drama and violence rather than actually care about their cause. The film is intelligently and thoughtfully written. The girl is by no means vindictive; as much as you want to vent your anger, she's clearly far too young to understand what is happening. It's the 'adults' who display their stupidity, their total lack of reasoning and fairness left me indignant for the entirety of the running time and subsequently the whole evening  the film really works.There is a palpable sense of danger throughout the film, you genuinely fear for Lucas' life; seldom have I empathised with a character so dearly. Who would've thought a Danish Art House film could be so thoroughly gripping?'The Hunt' is a thought provoking, tactful and important film that should be seen by as many people as possible. It's one of the best films of 2012.www.hawkensian.com"
7,The Hunt,9,25 July 2012,It's like a really messed up episode of Kids Say the Darndest Things.,"I just saw The Hunt at the New Zealand International Film Festival and I walked out speechless. The Hunt has such a difficult story to tell but the film makers never go too far with little exposition. The film doesn't take one side over another, making the point that there isn't really any ""bad guys"" in the film, just people on opposite sides of one coin. The script is shocking, tragic and at times funny. The film is very intimately shot with an almost documentary approach. The film is mostly shot hand-held, giving you the feeling of realism. The camera likes to get in close and hold on the actors eyes and it is the eyes that tell the story. Most of the story is told through what was not being said, but instead with looks and pauses. Mads Mikkelsen is stunning as always as the man accused of sexual abuse. He plays the role with such sensitivity to the character but always keeps you guessing throughout the film. Annika Wedderkopp plays the role of the innocent young girl to perfection, again always keeping you guessing. Their relationship being one of the most interesting I've seen on film this year. If I had one complaint it would be that the main plot ends quite abruptly, not leaving me fully satisfied before it goes into the epilogue. The Hunt is drama at its best with beautiful performances from the entire cast. It is hard to explain how great this film is without giving away spoilers but the film gives no clear answers for such a difficult subject and it makes you ask yourself, what would I do?"
8,The Hunt,9,3 September 2013,Finding His Way In The Forest,"Here in the small town where I reside, our local newspaper had a recent headline that a beloved teacher was suspected of improper contact with a student. The article was complete along with his picture and I felt that this teacher's life was over as he knew it whether the information was accurate or false. I felt that I would withhold judgement pending an accurate and a detailed investigation, but I know that others would not give the teacher this courtesy. Human nature is an interesting thing to observe and we often get trapped in our own snares with comments such as ""I really can't tolerate judgemental people"".Recently I saw another Danish movie ""The Hijacking"" and was so impressed with it, that I sought out this movie as it was also a highly regarded project. I'm glad I did. The movie reflected the idea of a rush to judgement and all the implications of how society reacts when information is inaccurately reinforced.The title of the movie, ""The Hunt"" is symbolic of Lucas's hunt for justice, but also feeling like the hunted. It begins with friends at a hunting camp drinking & celebrating but this hunt is all a metaphor for Lucas's life. Perhaps it was best expressed when his son got a family heirloom hunting rifle and it was said that now he was old enough to find his way in the forest. ""The Hunt"" is really about such a journey and the forest was thick with assumptions, accusations, hatred, betrayal, and a host of other thorns, briars, branches and such things to trip up the journey. Having felt like he was being hunted through a community's narrow rifle scope of understanding, Lucas's idea of hunting is ultimately altered....and believably so.Vinterberg does a masterful job of story telling and in such a way that we hear a morality tale. Yes, many times the information we are told in the news is correct. But what if it isn't? What price is paid by the victim and his/her family? If you want to watch a movie that is different from the typical Hollywood variety and gives you reason to search more deeply before believing what you see and hear, watch ""The Hunt"" and see if you would find your way through the same forest that Lucas traveled. Few of us would be able to do so...."
9,The Hunt,10,6 March 2013,Harrowing Film!,"Whenever I watch a great film, I always have a sense of feeling cleansed, as if a soiled part of me has been washed away (for the time being anyway) by something on the screen that touches a better part of my soul. THE HUNT certainly did that for me. The story is a simple one, a man, a teacher, is wrongly accused of sexually misconduct with a young child and his community, filled with old friends and acquaintances, turn on him and make his life a living hell.Vinterberg's film brings to mind many of the same topics and is loaded with the same visceral feelings that his first film THE CELEBRATION touches upon, sexual deviancy, alienation, the mob mentality of the righteous, mixing innocence with brutality in many of its most heartbreaking scenes. Mikkelsen handles the main character Lucas both with restraint, and a little explosiveness when warranted. It is this fine line between stability and chaos, of the civilized world and anarchy, that give this film an unpredictable quality. The entire cast is wonderful and Vinterberg's direction and writing are spot on. Great Film!"
10,The Hunt,,19 August 2013,Classy and disturbing tale of small town injustice.,"In Thomas Vinterberg's superb psychological thriller, The Hunt, a town turns on its kindergarten teacher, Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), from the erroneous testimony of a little girl, Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), who accuses him of molesting her. She's also the daughter of his best friend, Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), who believes along with the town that Lucas is guilty because children, especially his daughter, don't lie. Although Klara claims throughout she said a stupid thing and Lucas did nothing, his parents are convinced she is just reacting to the gravity and changing her story. Tragic blindness is not just the province of Oedipus.The film's title, with bookending male hunting rituals, is obviously figurative for the hunt by the town's people for Lucas's well being. Only too swift is their condemnation, their righteous indignation, blinded by Salem-witch like certainty that he is guilty. The town's vigilante-like attitude is reminiscent of Frankenstein's townsfolk, hounding the monster without even trying to understand.Beyond the figurative display of crowd wrong-headed mentality is the disturbing suggestion that at any time a life can be turned upside down without even being responsible. It also suggests that the only antidote is to keep believing in yourself.Maybe more powerful is a sense of humor, which occurs occasionally in the film and is best exemplified when a friend, upon Lucas's return from police headquarters, shouts as Lucas embraces his son, ""Hey! If you fondle your kid, you'll go back to jail."" It's gallows humor, but it is effective. Just as effective as the ironic humor is the low-key, natural lighting, consistent close-ups, and ubiquitous hand-held camera work. It is an intimate business that closes in on everyone in the town, not just the innocent victim.Having witnessed through this intense work of art the vulnerability all have in the face of a crowd mentality, we should remember the Chorus's final warning in Oedipus Rex: ""Therefore wait to see life's ending ere thou count one mortal blest; Wait till free from pain and sorrow he has gained his final rest."""
11,The Hunt,8,24 November 2012,Dissection of human nature,"Just like he did 14 years ago in Festen, Thomas Vinterberg once again shows us how a closely-knit community reacts to a shocking revelation. In Festen, a family party was spoiled by the revelation of a secret scandal. In Jagten, a group of friends and neighbours turn hostile when one of them is falsely accused of sexually abusing a young child, the daughter of his best friend. With microscopic precision, Vinterberg dissects the human nature. The accused, Lucas, baffled by the absurdity of the accusation, doesn't even bother to deny clearly. He rejects everyone who shows even the least bit of doubt, including his new girlfriend. His best friend Theo, the father of the young girl, clearly has doubts about Lucas's guilt, but sticks with his wife and daughter. Theo's wife is thoroughly convinced of Lucas's guilt, even when the child indicates he is innocent. The whole situation evolves into a nightmare for Lucas. He is not prosecuted after a police investigation fails to find any evidence, but the villagers have already made up their minds: he is a child molester. He loses his job, is being rejected by the village community and becomes the victim of violence himself. The movie is full of extremely intense scenes that make you shift uneasily on your chair. The various confrontations between Lucas and the villagers are very powerful, but so is the subplot about Lucas's son. A smart decision is that Vinterberg doesn't show anything about the investigation or the prosecution. It isn't important for the story, because the audience knows Lucas is innocent. Instead, the director only shows the way Lucas's friends react and cope with the situation. Jagten is filmed in a realistic style, without many cinematographic effects. The emotionality of the story and the strong acting are enough to carry the movie. The approach is reminiscent of the Dogma-style from Festen, but the strict Dogma-rules are a thing of the past. In some Christmas scenes, Vinterberg clearly makes use of special lighting techniques to create a cozy atmosphere. The whole film is a very strong watching experience. The shocking and unexpected ending, which is open for interpretation, is the cherry on the cake."
12,The Hunt,10,3 March 2013,simply wonderful...,"what can i say?this movie is simply a masterpiece. this movie is what i hope to see every time i enter a cinema.this movie is warm, engaging, natural, simple, cruel, human... it is everything at once.i cried my soul out, it is unbelievable how danish directors (lars von trier and thomas vinterberg) are able to move me with their movies.story is superb. casting is superb. acting is superb. directing is superb.they say danish people are cold and detached, denmark being a northern country. no one ever takes me to such an emotional journey as danish directors... i think i should marry a danish guy ;)let me sum it up with what i already said before: this movie is the reason why i go to the cinema in the first place. not for the entertainment, but for the art. for that feeling that i just read a wonderful book. that feeling of satisfaction that i just did something great for my soul. purging, cleansing of my soul, if i may say it that way.beautiful. thank you, thomas vinterberg... and thanks to the rest of the crew."
13,The Hunt,7,19 December 2012,Sometimes we're too quick to see men as monsters,"This film comes right after the hysteria generated by the Jimmy Saville abuse scandals and the revelations about pedophilia within the Catholic Church.Suffice to say it is refreshing and pertinent to see a story about the damage that can be caused to an innocent man, by a false report. We live in a society that is increasingly insecure and paranoid about pedophilia, rape and abuse. Virgin Airlines won't allow a man to sit next to a child who is traveling alone. Men are given funny looks in playgrounds. Mothers are reported to social workers when they give their screaming kids a slap in public.This film demonstrates the danger that comes from that hysteria and reminds us all that children, for whatever reason, do not always tell the truth. The consequences are brutal and made all the more realistic by a stellar cast of actors. I give props to the young actress playing Klara, the girl who makes the false accusation, she was fantastic.Distressing, highly emotional, but unlike an American movie, never over-bearing in its sentimentality, minus one or two slightly cliché metaphors in the dialogue. It makes you empathize with all the characters, not just the protagonist and really makes you think about what you would do if you found yourself, or someone you loved, in that situation."
14,The Hunt,9,24 October 2012,A shocking picture of injustice and paranoia,"According to English Professor Jack Lynch, ""Lies, once they are accepted as true, take on a life of their own, one that lasts long after the original falsehoods have been exposed."" The power of the continued acceptance of lies is reflected in Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt, the disturbing story of the false accusation of a kindergarten teacher of sexual abuse. It is an accusation that reveals the sordid underbelly of a small town, hidden beneath the veneer of middle-class civility. Written by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm, The Hunt is a thought-provoking drama that makes us aware both of the vigilance needed to protect our children from predators, and of the crucial importance of following the precept that an individual is innocent until proved guilty in a court of law.Mads Mikkelsen is Lucas, is a caring kindergarten teacher who has been recently divorced and shares custody of his teenage son, Marcus (Lasse Fogelstrom). He has a good relationship with his students, especially six-year-old Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), the daughter of his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) and his wife Agnes (Anne Louise Hassing). Lucas walks her home from school when her parents are late in picking her up and she obviously likes him very much. In class one day, Klara kisses Lucas on the lips but is admonished by him that kissing on the lips is only for mum and dad. Sparked by seeing images on her bother's iPod, she tells kindergarten head Grethe (Susse Wold) that she doesn't like Lucas anymore because he has a ""weenie."" When Grethe tells her that this is normal because every man has one, Klara tells her that his was ""straight and pointed."" The incident is forgotten about for a few days until Grethe realizes that ""children never lie"", and begins questioning the little girl again, coming to the decision that sexual abuse has occurred and that some action must be taken. Though Klara now says that she cannot remember, her parents attribute her loss of memory to trying to forget what is uncomfortable. Calling a group of parents together, Grethe accuses Lucas before the parents, telling them the signs to watch out for in their own children. Slowly, the word gets around of widespread abuse at the school, though Lucas remains in the dark because Grethe refuses to give him any details about the accusations.Word spreads by hearsay, gossip, and innuendo as a child psychologist, teachers, parents, and eventually the police are brought in, but no through investigation is ever conducted. Klara is questioned again (questions taken directly from the transcripts of actual police cases) and it is obvious she is a confused little girl who tells the adults what they want to hear. Vinterberg ratchets up the tension and we sense the world closing in on the embattled teacher. Though Lucas' male friends in the community have a long-lasting bond, they break the ties of their close-knit group and turn against one of their own.Lucas and Marcus are denied the right to shop in the local market even to the point of threats and violence, his best friend Theo rejects him, and even his girlfriend Nadja (Alkexandra Rapaport) asks him if he's insane or sick. Lucas' only friend is Marcus' godfather, Bruun (Lars Ranthe), who soothes his friend's psyche with black humor. After Lucas is arrested, a preliminary hearing rules that there is not enough evidence to hold him and he is released, but this does not stop the violence. A rock is tossed through his window and neighborhood thugs take out their aggression on his dog Fanny.The Hunt is a harrowing experience that is not an easy film to watch, especially if the viewer has had past experience with the subject. The exceptional performances, however, make it easier to appreciate. They are not only from Mikkelson who won Best Actor at Cannes, but also from Fogelstrom as Lucas' loving and supportive son, Ranthe who keeps Lucas afloat, and especially that of seven-year-old actress Annika Wedderkopp who is so angelic that we never turn against her even though we know she is lying. While some critics bemoan the fact that this kind of story has been told before, it has never been told like this, building with inexorable power from the warmth of small-town conviviality to a shocking picture of injustice and paranoia that hits us right in the solar plexus."
15,The Hunt,8,24 October 2012,"""Dramatic, poignant and rightfully provocative...""","Danish screenwriter and director Thomas Vinterberg's eight feature film which he co-wrote with Danish screenwriter and director Tobias Lindholm and co-produced, premiered In competition at the 65th Cannes International Film Festival in 2012, was screened in the Special Presentations section at the 37th Toronto International Film Festival in 2012 and is a Danish production which was shot on location in Denmark and produced by Danish producer and screenwriter Morten Kaufmann and Danish producer Sisse Graum Jørgensen. It tells the story about Lucas, a recently divorced middle-aged man who just began working at a kindergarten and who wishes to spend more time with his teenage son Marcus who lives with his mother. After starting a romance with a foreign woman named Nadja things improve, but one day during a conversation with Grethe who runs the day-care center, he learns that a girl named Klara has told her an unsettling story about him. In a matter of days a spark is turned into a flame and a harmonic village into an irrational witch-hunt against one individual. Finely and acutely directed by Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg, this finely paced fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view, draws an instantly involving and profoundly heartrending portrayal of a little girl who after being unintentionally hurt by a well-liked man whom she has a childhood crush on, unknowingly and with only a few words incriminates him by expressing her anger to the head of the kindergarten. While notable for its naturalistic rural milieu depictions, fine production design by Danish production designer Torben Stig Nielsen, cinematography by Danish cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen, editing by Danish film editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud, use of sound and realism, this character-driven and narrative-driven psychological drama about family relations, friendship and irrevocable accusations which is set during a late winter in Denmark, depicts a refined study of character and contains a good score by Danish composer Nikolaj Egelund. This somewhat romantic, at times humorous, atmospheric and tangible intrigue which has been chosen as Denmark's official submission to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards in 2014 and where a friendship is tested, a hunter becomes the hunted and the question of guilt transforms ordinary people into paranoid Savages, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, subtle character development, mysterious characters, brilliant writing, the tailor-made though distinct and accomplished acting performance by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen, the understated acting performance by Danish actor Thomas Bo Larsen and the impressively authentic acting performance by child actress Annika Wedderkopp. A dramatic, poignant and rightfully provocative tale which gained, among other awards, the award for Best Actor Mads Mikkelsen and the Vulcain Prize of the Technical Artist Charlotte Bruus Christensen for outstanding cinematography at the 65th Cannes Film Festival in 2012."
16,The Hunt,10,6 December 2013,He doesn't have a basement....,"There is a moment in this masterpiece when you know that that is the part that is going to spiral someone's life out of control. And in this movie, it's the split second scene where Klaras brother shows her an indecent picture on the IPad.It's not served to you on a plate, but its little subtle things like this, that make this movie the harrowing piece it is.Mikkelsen is wonderful as Lucas, a lonely teacher who is just trying to get his life back on track. His son is about to move in with him, and he has met a potential partner, but when Klara, his best friends daughter makes him a gift, and he refuses it because he feels its inappropriate, she tells the teacher a lie, that will shake the whole community.As the viewer, you feel so much empathy for Lucas, because you know that his career is over, and that his life will never be the same, but at the same time, you feel anger toward the rest of the community, because they banish him, without letting him speak.Its a taboo subject, because any sane person would take the youngsters side, but it's the fact that when she says to her mother she made it up, the mother just brushes it off, and it gets worse and worse for Lucas.It really is a hard hitting film, the cast are wonderful, and having it set around Christ,as, gives the mood an even more lonely feel for Lucas.It's not for all tastes, it will leave you exhausted, especially the final scene, which leaves you knowing that Lucas will always be guilty to some, even though it's been proved otherwise.Essential viewing."
17,The Hunt,10,1 January 2013,It hurts...,"This is the most powerful drama I had the fortune to experience this past year. It's up there with Michael Haneke's AMOUR, but this definitely made me *feel* more. When, near the ending of THE HUNT, we have some hope for the protagonist, a kindergarten teacher who has been unjustly accused of child molestation, I actually thought something like ""I hope the movie ends right now!"" This because Thomas Vinterberg (director of movies like FESTEN and DEAR WENDY) makes us feel each and every moment of the great injustice that is shown in the screen. Yes, we feel for the protagonist Lucas (top-notch performance by Mads Mikkelsen) but also for his family and friends, especially for his teenage son. Obviously the, really wished, ""happy ending"" is highly unlikely as this is a realistic portrait of human nature. In the beginning of the film we have a group of Danish hunters (Lucas included) sharing good times, drinking, talking, just having fun. Apparently they're a real ""family"" of friends. The little daughter of Lucas' best friend is the one who begins the sexual abuse rumor, by telling the kindergarten director that Lucas showed her his penis. The parents of this girl didn't give her the enough attention; finding more important to be arguing than taking her to school, for instance. And Lucas was there to help the girl  it's a really ironic film. The way the families of the supposedly victims react; how the behavior of a family affects their infants; the general thought we have about children; and also those subjects of violence and friendship. Everything is shown here in a very credible way. The violence really ""hurts"" you; and I think if a film like THE HUNT doesn't provokes you *rage*, well, none will. Highly recommended, and for sure one of my favorites of 2012. *Watched it on 26 December, 2012"
18,The Hunt,10,7 August 2013,Wow.,"A Little History - I have a wide range of actors that I love. Most of the time, I like to backtrack through a couple of their previous films when I like them a lot, and then I just get on with it. Not the case here. I decided to start watching Hannibal about 6 months after it aired and I got my first good look at a spectacular Danish actor named Mads Mikkelsen. He is extremely talented but, judging by the fact that I love horror films, have seen Silence Of The Lambs numerous times, and figured the television show could never match the talents of the wonderful Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, I wrote it off. Until about three episodes in when this God of Danish cinema showed off his talents. After the show, and because I adore foreign cinema, I decided to binge on every single one of his movies. That my friends, is how I came across The Hunt.The Basics - So after giving you the background of what I've been doing for the past couple of months, this is the first of many Mads movies I chose. I have some background with Danish cinema and am an avid Von Trier fan so I know Danish films have amazing potential. The movie stars M.M. as a single father named Lucas who leads a lonely life teaching primary school and striving for custody of his son. He has a likable group of friends including his best friend Theo, who has a wife and child Lucas is close with as well. Everything is going smooth until one day, a small lie changes the course of Lucas's life.It Would Probably Be Better - For you to go in blind as I did...just beware, this is a tough number to swallow. It is unrelenting and uncomfortable, however, don't let that scare you away...you should see it, everyone should see it.Mad For Mads - My God is he exquisite in his craft...he practically carries the entire film and does so with a passion not many actors have. This film bumped him into my 'favorites' for sure. You can just feel every thought, every ounce of pain and turmoil he is going through...it's harrowing and heartbreaking and I was crying at the end.Best Scenes - 1. The scene in the convenience store is amazing. You are rooting for Lucas the entire time. 2. The scene when you realize that though everyone is against him...he still has a couple of people on his side. 3. The scene in the church (which if you've seen the trailer, you get a small glimpse of) took my breath away and had me wiping tears.Overall - This movie is a tough watch, but rewarding nonetheless due to its well told story and outstanding acting. It was the first of many Mads movies I've played - also the first of many that had me crying - and a firm step back into the world of heart wrenching Danish cinema. I strongly recommend the watch.Verdict - 10/10 Stars. You can view all of my reviews at http://dianalynn5287.blogspot.com/"
19,The Hunt,3,18 April 2013,I'm sorry but this was story was full of holes,"I hate to give this a bad review as I am a big fan of Mads BUT there are so many ridiculous parts to this story I can not believe how people have rated it. As a teacher, firstly the whole premise of this film is that 'kids never lie' well I'm sorry but any teacher who's been in the job more than a day knows that kids lie all the time. Secondly the other kids would not just make stories up about being abused - and collaborate on a story; especially at a nursery.Why did he never mention the fact she had tried to kiss him?! I found it so frustrating I almost switched it off.They would never send a male to interview a female student and they do not use such direct questioning. A teacher would not get sacked without even asking where the abuse is said to have taken place.Finally, although the film is beautifully shot and Mads plays the role brilliantly his 'best friend' had the most ridiculous fake beard I've seen since the Life of Brian."
20,The Hunt,5,7 February 2014,Compelling Premise Becomes Preposterous,"""The Hunt,"" the latest from Thomas Vinterberg, takes a compelling premise but pushes its credibility, and its audience's patience, so far that any impact the film might have had is blunted under the weight of its preposterousness.Mads Mikkelsen plays a kindergarten teacher who is accused by a little girl of exposing himself to her. We know from the start he's not guilty, and that the girl says what she does out of a combination of confusion and anger. But as soon as the idea is planted in the heads of the teachers and parents, they use it to go on a witch hunt with one person as their target.Watching the film is sort of like watching a car accident in slow motion. We see one bad decision pile itself on top of another, and a situation that could have easily (or at least more efficiently) been resolved instead turn into a spiraling nightmare. The problem is that the events in the film don't make any sense (or at least didn't to this American viewer). The kindergarten teacher who first hears of the allegations decides to call in the mom of the little girl, tell her that her daughter may have been molested, and then says there isn't anything else to discuss at that moment in time!! And the mom accepts that!!! And then the teacher announces at that evening's parent/teacher night that all of their children might also have been molested, and hands out informational pamphlets!!!! And none of the parents ask any questions!!!!!! Maybe there's a cultural disconnect, but I can't imagine parents in any country handling this situation in the way it's portrayed in this film.And the implausibilities just add up from there. A much more effective and interesting film would have found people following proper procedures and still not being able to shake their inherent knee-jerk prejudices. But an incident like the one in this film, or any incident for that matter, is of course going to get out of control if everyone acts as crazy as they do in this movie. The film manipulates its characters into doing things that it doesn't seem plausible people would actually do, just to make a point. That's called building up a straw man argument, which are famous for being able to knock down.Perhaps Vinterberg means for his film to be morbidly funny, a black comedy of the absurd. But if so, he doesn't handle the material well enough to make that clear. He invites us to scratch our heads in disbelief at how poorly people can behave, but doesn't make those people's behavior believable enough for us to care.Grade: B-"
21,The Hunt,5,31 March 2013,I'll cast the first stone,"A mid-aged man is just coming out of crisis. His wife has left him with their son, but he has found a new job as a Kindergarten teacher. Then a girl from his group makes accusations that he has indecently exposed himself to her; unable to prove his innocence, he is hunted by the entire community, including his childhood friends.A chilling and fundamentally plausible story, but I thought the movie didn't handle it well. Untypically for director Thomas Vinterberg, who came to acclaim with an eerily similar story (a pater familias is exposed to accusations during a family celebration that he has raped his children), the film didn't come across as credible to me. Instead, it felt like a sensationalist TV movie, and it was also dragging on. I didn't like the way the relationship between Lucas and Nadja was handled, it felt like they were jumping their bones rather than developing a relationship -- at times it felt like Nadja was almost stalking Lucas. And it's always problematic when a native actor or actress (such as Alexandra Rapaport, who -- despite her Polish roots and exotic looks -- is born in Denmark) has to play a foreigner with little language skills. It would have been a much better movie with more understatement -- especially, if there had been some doubt in the community, rather than everybody instantly ""buying"" the accusation (for example, the headmistress of the small Kindergarten says that ""children don't lie"", which seems ludicrous, especially since she says previously that Klara -- the girl making the accusation -- is prone to telling fibs). The movie would have been much more involving if it had focused more on the ultimate impossibility of refuting such an accusation, the creeping doubts, rather than almost everyone taking the stance ""the little girl said it, so it must be true"" and running a vendetta against Lucas.Only in the end does the movie capture this ambiguity."
22,The Hunt,10,21 May 2015,excellent drama that is tough to watch,"The thing about Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt that you should know is that there's no ""twist"" or big revelation. There's no real ambiguity about whether or not Lucas touched or 'showed' himself to little Klara, the daughter of Lucas' best friend. If there were, this might be a very different movie - perhaps even one that leaned on being dishonest with the audience about the 'did he or didn't he' intentions. It's clear enough early on that Klara isn't telling the whole truth when she mentions to one of the other Kindergarten workers about the ""rod"" that stands up (meaning the penis), but it doesn't mean she's exactly lying either, just confused in that way that little kids who don't know anything about sex might be if, say, shown a very brief image of a ""rod"". So there's that. But what The Hunt is really about is perception and how quickly people can turn on someone with a target on them - guilt or no guilt, but especially in the case of not guilty - like with Lucas.Vinterberg expertly sets up this problem by first showing life as (relatively) normal - Lucas is a father in the process of a divorce, has a great group of guy friends (the kind of Denmark/Sweden/etc who come together, sometimes swim naked in the cold, and drink a lot and sing), and is a teacher at a Kindergarten school. Nothing is shown with any heightened drama, all the cuts to someone in a moment are to show the progression of a moment or a scene - closer to documentary than anything, at least at first - and this helps make the mood past any melodrama for what's to come. Or, if there may be melodrama ahead, it won't be circumspect for the audience: real families in a small town, really close-knit, Church-going, loving, pleasant... and underneath is a whole lot of fear, which can switch to anger, resentment, and horror.Mikkelson is great in the role, and he may be surprising for those who haven't seen him as a villain in other films (he was a Bond villain once, or if he wasn't he will be someday), as well as the title role of Hannibal Lector on the recent TV series. I haven't seen that show yet, but even if I had it wouldn't change how he works in this film. Could there be any hint in his performance of any evil or misdeeds capable of him? Not far as we can see, though there is that scene where Lucas is first brought in to his superior's office and told of the accusation made. Watch his body language, how his face looks and reacts to this. It could look either way - for the person looking for it, he smacks his lips, he quivers just slightly, he doesn't come out and say 'I didn't do it', but we should know that he didn't. But does the other character know? With something like child molestation? The topic is so hot-button, whether it's more in the United States or over in Denmark I can't tell, but the safety (and reliability) of a child is such a crucial thing in daily life that it makes for such powerful, potent stuff for The Hunt, as the accusation spirals out - are there other kids(!) just by nightmares and headaches who can tell - and ruins his life, whether he's found guilty or (especially) not. The last act especially is tough to watch as morality is questioned and the mob mentality of a town takes over (not to extreme heights, this isn't Fritz Lang or something, but close enough, realistically enough, just with all those faces).Quiet scenes punctuate a lot of this film, as much as the brutal ones where rage and bewilderment overflow, like shots of someone having to do something tragic in the rain, and it all builds up to something that is hard to watch. I mean that as a compliment, though it should be said that this is the kind of film I'm not sure I can watch very soon again: it strikes such resonant chords and presents its characters so honestly, the ones looking for grace and those who just cannot, that it's hard not to feel shaken up after it."
23,The Hunt,10,24 November 2013,The Hunting experience,"This is a very rare kind of movie. It takes years between one and another. And I really can't remember when was the last time I was watch something like this. This is a kind of movie you watch in complete silence. You don't talk (if you watch it with someone, of course), you don't comment anything, you just watch. And watch. In silence. ""The Hunt"" is a highly sensitive matter and it is delivered very subtle. Can't be better. The story is well written, the direction is refined. The acting is superb. Mads Mikkelsen is the king. On of the best actors alive... And when this movie ends, it will leave you in silence. Speechless. A unique movie experience that will - HUNT you! For a long, long time..."
24,The Hunt,,4 November 2013,"One of the Strongest Contenders for Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, This Year.","A brilliantly painted portrait of how prejudice can turn even the most decent people into a mindless mob, The Hunt is a provocative study of our ever judgmental society which is always ready to believe anything that gives them a chance to persecute someone without even verifying the accusation or caring about how affecting & damaging it could actually be if the accused turns out to be innocent.Set around Christmas in a small Danish town, The Hunt (also known as Jagten) tells the story of Lucas; a kindergarten schoolteacher in his mid-40s who is admired by his peers, loved by his school children & is friendly with everyone in town. But his life soon turns upside down when an innocent lie spreads like wildfire throughout the town and does an irrevocable damage to his life, dignity & relationships.Beautifully directed by Thomas Vinterberg, the story isn't concerned with how Lucas proves his innocence but instead focuses on how he deals with the isolation & hostility that comes from his community after the false accusation. Screenplay deals with a sensitive subject matter but isn't afraid to throw uncomfortable questions at its audience, while all its technical aspects are executed in a very serene manner.Coming to the acting department, this is Mads Mikkelsen's show all the way for the actor delivers the finest work of his short but admirable career with a performance that perfectly captures Lucas' plight & his Best Actor win at Cannes for this role was a well-deserving one. Also bringing further solidity to this aspect is the young Annika Wedderkopp who plays Klara; daughter of Lucas' best friend.But the most powerful thing about The Hunt is that it puts up some very difficult questions in front of us & isn't afraid to ask for an answer. It shows us that children are indeed capable of saying the stupidest things without any idea of what it can do to someone's life & reputation and how society always believes their version of truth without even looking for any evidence because in their eyes, children don't lie.On an overall scale, The Hunt is a wonderfully directed, skilfully written, vividly photographed, smoothly edited & calmly scored cinema that's impressive, thought-provoking & potent in every way, is one of the finest films to come out from Denmark, manages to maintain a strong grip on our emotions from start to finish, really makes its viewers connect with Lucas' predicament, and is scarier than your average horror flick. Strongly recommended."
25,The Hunt,8,12 May 2013,Gossip kills,"Vinterberg has made many disturbing movies in the good sense. This is no exception. The 42-year-old male assistant at a daycare center is falsely accused by a child for sexual abuse. Since children don't lie about such thing, he's doomed. But he's innocent.A Via Dolorosa starts for Mads Mikkelsen in this little Danish village. There's no smoke without fire and it doesn't matter if the prosecution turns the whole thing down.It's not that gossip necessarily kills you physically, but it kills your soul. Great drama by Vinterberg, including the interesting subject of friendship between men. What is it worth?"
26,The Hunt,7,18 July 2013,Great movie except for two serious issues,"The acting is terrific. Even the child who plays the 5yo Klara does a phenomenal job. So what are my two beefs? (1) The movie clearly takes place now. If the movie had been set back in the 1970s or maybe even early 1980s, I could buy into the storyline. I can't buy into it if the action is contemporary. Why not? Because in the last 30-40 years there've been countless documented cases of young children ""recalling"" sexual abuse, very often unconsciously prodded and guided by overzealous principals and psychologists, like the two depicted in the movie. And the principal? ""Children don't lie. I believe the children."" Really?! I don't mean to imply children lie all the time, but it's well recognized today that children can confabulate, particularly when they're confused, upset, and unconsciously (or consciously) manipulated by adults. Were the people of the Danish village where the action takes place that isolated and removed from the outside world not to realize this could be the case? Sorry. I just couldn't buy into it. (2) Ambiguity of the ending. The lead character, Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), the guy accused of abusing little Klara, has been exonerated and everyone seems reconciled and buddy-buddy again. A group of them go hunting, including Lucas. While he's standing in the woods, the loud crack of a shot rings out. He instinctively falls to the ground, dropping his rifle. He looks up to see a man emerging from the underbrush holding a rifle at him. Because the sun's rays are striking his eyes, Lucas can't tell who the man is. Lucas rises. I assumed because he rose, he wasn't hit. Did the man simply error and shoot because he mistook Lucas for a deer? Or did the man shoot at him because he never bought into Lucas's innocence? And when he sees Lucas is still alive, will he shoot him fatally? Or maybe the man's a serial killer. Or maybe ... If you like your movies with an ambiguous ending, well, this one has it. But personally I found it downletting.I definitely would have given this movie a higher rating except for these two issues, in my opinion faults. Rating: 7 stars out of 10.Even though I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 I'd still highly recommend it. The acting alone is worth it."
27,The Hunt,6,1 January 2014,"Compelling, But Not Entirely Plausible","Jagten's story has much to offer in terms of controversy - a well-loved kindergarten teacher, recently divorced, but with many good friends in the small community. But things go horribly wrong for Lucas when an accusation is made against him by a child, and the situation escalates out of control.What happens after that, as a result of a child's innocent imagination, is ugly. The acting performances of Mads Mikkelsen and the supporting cast were commendable given that it was a great challenge to make the ensueing events believable and comfortable for the viewers.Personally for me, there are some parts in this movie that were less plausible, for instance how easily long-forged friendships were torn down easily by some event w/o physical evidence, how easily violence takes over rationale and reasonable judgement, and one year is not a convincing enough timeframe to display on the 'surface' that things return to normal.Jagten is a work well done, but it pales in comparison to ""A Separation"", also a movie that deals with very controversial subjects but manages to carry it well with full, plausible scenarios."
28,The Hunt,10,3 April 2013,If you want proof that Mads Mikkelsen is one of the finest actors around look no further.,"I would easily rate this film as the best I saw in 2012. Not an easy watch by any means, the story revolves around a Danish Primary School Teacher who is accused of molesting a child from his class. In circumstances that are as believable as they are positively frightening paranoia becomes evidence as the wrong questions are asked by the wrong people and poor Lucas finds himself suspended from his job and becomes the town pariah in a very small community. As the hate and abuse begins to mount and with his own girlfriend doubting him, Lucas wonders if his life will ever be the same as he struggles to try and prove his innocence.As besets the calm manner of the Danes, the acting here is beautifully observed and subtly explored in a range of superb performances by the whole cast. Special mention must go to the younger members of the cast who are simply outstanding and credit too, to the director for being able to guide them through what must have been very tricky scenes.A superb watch for anyone who wants to see either a dam good thriller or some fine actors at work, this simply is first rate. The social dichotomy at work in the script and the uncomfortable issues explores are so relevant in todays society, that this really is a film that every Sun and Daily Mail reader should be forced to watch. Outstanding all round."
29,The Hunt,1,7 March 2017,Extremely unrealistic,"This is one of the worst, most preposterous films I've ever seen.The reactions of the teacher and the villagers are totally unrealistic.Lucas hardly blinks when told a child has accused him of abuse. He doesn't seem shocked, but just shrugs (conveniently making him look all the more guilty in the eyes of the head teacher). She and the villagers all base their conclusions on the premise that ""children don't lie"" (oh, come on!), and the formerly very popular Lucas is immediately guilty in their eyes.Even when the child tells her mother that Lucas did nothing and she was just saying ""something foolish"", the mother puts words into the little girl's mouth, saying she ""probably just doesn't remember what happened"". All Lucas' friends immediately turn against him, fully believing the little child.There are lots of ""meaningful"" looks instead of realistic dialogue (it is an art film, after all).The ending of the film is a major cop-out and absolute rubbish. Suddenly it's one year later and everything's hunky-dory. So the film- makers were too lazy or too unable to explain how Lucas came to forgive the so-called friends who had condemned him, beaten him, killed his beloved dog and ruined his life and reputation. That would be just a little too difficult to justify, I suppose.No, the story is utterly unbelievable, preposterous and annoying. In fact it could be considered dangerous, as it might put ideas into some kid's head about how to get revenge on a disliked teacher.There's even a scene obviously copied from ""The Deerhunter"" at the very end.I'll give it one star for the scenery. Otherwise awful."
30,The Hunt,7,4 April 2015,Good movie with stupid characters,"I can definitely say that I like the topic of this movie and its approach to it. I also like the general story line and the acting. It had a good use of camera position and usage of sound to make many parts feel tense. You root for the main character and are scared that something bad will happen to him.Besides that, there is one thing that really hurt this movie in my opinion: the characters act irrational and stupid. I am fully aware that this is kind of the point of the movie, to show that one small mistake can get out of control and destroy a life. However, I feel like it was overdone. I am quite sure I am not the only one who hoped that something bad happens to the people in the store and their likes, but I can see how their behavior makes sense in the context of the movie. Anyhow, there are scenes where people seem to be acting hateful just to get the movie to the point where it should be. Most notable for me, the scene in which Grethe gets her friend (?) to talk to Klara the first time. That is not anywhere close to how such a talk with a child should or would be executed by a professional. Maybe it is supposed to be that way because from what I could tell, Grethe's friend is just some guy who is not actually qualified to do that kind of work. Either way, it just felt very forced and artificial to me and I was close to turning the movie off because it felt so unbelievable.But as I said, it is mostly a good movie except for this weakness and after some time, these awkward, forced scenes fall off."
31,The Hunt,9,2 August 2013,Armed and dangerous,"The genius of this film, for me, is its exposé of righteousnesshow ugly people get when we not only hate, but revel in it, fortified by a sense of being justified, when the hated one is known to be utterly evil, really deserves it. You can really go to town, excoriating a monster. The hastening to judgement, the pell-mell, giddy rush toward it is so well depicted because the film keeps us in the perspective of the one judged and condemned, a chance target for an apparent ready supply of vitriol. That's what's really frightening about the scenario in The Hunt; not that Lucas is accused or who accuses him, but how easily forces are marshalled against him. It's the fearsome eagerness to hate, punish and ostracize that is horrifying. The macho, man's man scenes at the opening of the film and its closing bracket this theme with a sense of a culture quick to pull triggers and confident in its right to pull them. Solid cinematography, fine acting, even on the part of the central child figure, and tight editing all contribute to an exceptional drama and a thought-provoking work of art."
32,The Hunt,9,28 July 2013,perfectly painful observation of social dynamics,"In all likelihood, 'The Hunt' will be the best film released in 2013. It's superior to everything else I've seen this year in almost every way. The script, the cinematography, the score, the scenery, and of course the performances are the best I've seen since 'A Separation'. Mads Mikkelsen - who could very well be called Europe's finest actor at present - delivers his easily most brilliant work here. If you generally don't like European movies, but try to watch one every once in a while to expand your horizon - don't miss this. It's film at its very best, combining skill, message and suspense into a harrowing, yet engaging work of art.This was Vinterberg's first Cannes entry in 15 years since his debut 'Celebration', which initiated the neo-realist Dogme movement, won the Jury Prize and catapulted him to international fame. 'The Hunt' was passed over for best film by the (in my opinion overrated) 'Love' by Haneke. Mikkelsen won the award for his performance, but nevertheless it took a long time for the film to get generally released. That's most likely due to its (supposedly) controversial subject matter of children lying about having been sexually abused. It's quite possible that many people, especially parents and teachers, could feel alienated by the way the accusation automatically evolves into a full-scale witch-hunt. One could argue that the film views this problem entirely from the angle of the protagonist, and ignores the difficulty for children to address abuse when it has really happened to them.I would understand such criticism, even though I personally feel it is unfounded. For Vinterberg's theme here seems to me less rooted in the topic of abuse, but rather group dynamics. As in 'Celebration', he's focusing on the immense difficulty for an individual to address a harm done by the hostility of some and then the acquiescence of the whole surrounding society. That's what makes 'The Hunt' so superior - it manages to emphasize that a community which ignores a single person's rights can easily deteriorate, and that - in the end - we're all as vulnerable as the protagonist is: any accusation from whatever angle may lead to ostracizing and social death.If there's one slight weakness to the film, it's its very perfection. The story doesn't feel as constructed as, for instance, in Haneke's films, wherein there is always one decisive scene around which the whole plot appears to be built. But the final shot felt to me a bit as if it's been chosen for maximum dramatic effect. Still, if you compare 'The Hunt' to 'Love', it's definitely a more skillfully handled and comprehensible resolution."
33,The Hunt,8,22 November 2013,Superb and important Danish gem,"A film about suspected child abuse is almost certainly going to be a difficult watch and this is no exception. Thankfully this is a sensitive and extremely well written drama focusing on the aftermath of an accusation. It raises some important questions about allegations, how they are dealt with and peoples reactions to them. There are no easy answers and the film doesn't try to answer them.The acting is solid if unspectacular but you are drawn into the story pretty early on and it never loses it's grip on you. The Hunt is a film that will stir a lot of emotions in you.I was surprised at it's high rating before watching it but there is no doubt it deserves it. A stronger ending would have elevated this higher than an 8 in my book but it's still a very very good drama."
34,The Hunt,1,12 February 2014,No logic causes high irritation,"Sorry, but I have to give this a 1 out of 10 just due to that the grown ups in this movie follow no logic. A child just said he saw a mans dick stiff, and apparently just this is proof enough that he is a child molester. Even though the girl who lies about this ha a perverted brother who constantly shows her pornography movies on his mobile in front of his parents. Maybe a bell should ring? And the guy who is accused defends himself horrible, speaking way too little almost like he actually molested the child! Plus before this the girl kissed the man on his mouth and sent him a love letter, and when he told her that ""this is for grown ups"", and tried to talk some sense to her she said that she hated him. He should now understand that this obviously is a revenge from her side (typical girl / woman psycho mind) and should explain this. All this caused just irritation and is frustrating to watch. Very bad script and story. The actors over-act a bit too and the main character is under-acting."
35,The Hunt,5,14 February 2015,So disappointed,"I had been looking forward to this movie for ages. For some reason it kept eluding me. But finally I sat down to watch it...and as intended, I was outraged, appalled and absolutely disappointed - but because of the terrible plot. This movie might have worked, if it was set in the 1930's, but this takes place in 2014 and it makes absolutely no sense what so ever. I get the idea of making a big deal of nothing, Mob tendencies, twisting everything to create drama, joint discrimination and so on and so forth - all of that and again the movie could have worked for me, if set in 1930 or something, but all it really did was p*ss me off, because none of this would never EVER happen in Denmark today!! To begin with, there has been so much taboo in the 80's about male daycare workers molesting children, that today everyone is extremely careful to make assumptions about it. It is handled with the utmost care. Second, the first thing you would do in any such situation is contact the parents. This is something daycare workers are taught. You would never let a psychologist or anyone else talk to the child without the parents consent. They would have to be informed for this to take place. It would never happen without their knowledge. Third, the way this psychologist put words in the child's mouth? WOULD NOT HAPPEN!!! This was the most horrible part - they tried so hard to make it disgusting and I was disgusted by the abysmal way this interview was happening. Nevermind the fact the parents always have to be present. But there are extremely clear guidelines to this kind of interview. None of which was used. And lastly I'll mention all the violence and assaults that nobody bothers to report to the police? Come on!! There are just so many errors in this movie that I had an extremely hard time watching it to the end. And this was our Oscar contribution? I'm embarrassed, because we Danes make amazing movies. This wasn't one of them."
36,The Hunt,,24 November 2012,A great and horrible film at the same time,"I got out of the theatre, after watching this masterpiece, totally washed up. Torn to pieces. Burned out. I guess this story of an innocent man accused of child molesting has already been told before. I am sure I have seen a British movie like this one, and shot in the early sixties. I don't remember the title. This film is outstanding and Madds Mikelsen absolutely fantastic. He deserved his award in Cannes Festival. An awful tale that really hurts. I felt real pain watching how stupid the human being can become. During one second, I felt ashamed to be a human being myself. And the reality is often far worse. After being ""washed"" of any suspicion, first accused men remain ostracized from their community, even after the children have confessed that they lied !!!Human beings...The sequence where the young girl's mother learns that her daughter lied about the poor man, and then asks the child to continue to lie, in order not to change anything, this scene is unbearable. You want to get into the film, into the screen, and kick this f...mother. Of yes, you burn to kick this bloody woman for all the pain she inflicts to the man falsely accused.And that's not even cruelty, but only stupidity. STUPIDITY from the human nature.I won't talk about mindless children's talks about anything and also everything. Children are what they are. That's always be this way and it will remain so. Only children. Only adults are the real evil in this kind of terrible tale. That's my opinion, and maybe I am wrong...But I don't think so.A gem. A real gem."
37,The Hunt,7,19 December 2013,Gripping movie undermined by plot flaws,"This finely crafted, thought-provoking movie examines conflict in a small, close-nit Danish town confronted by one of the great moral corruptions of our age. Sharing, caring and community quickly descend into vindictiveness, violence, and marginalization. The cast is excellent, with Mads Mikkelsen putting in another mesmerising performance, and the evocative cinematography captures austere but beautiful Danish landscapes and small town life.But perhaps I lost something in translation, for this otherwise standout movie has some frustrating plot flaws I couldn't overlook. Maybe Danes are naturally taciturn people who can't handle confrontation, because the protagonist when faced with accusations of child molestation merely nods and accepts them, instead of vigorously professing his innocence, then he shuns those who dare doubt him, instead of defending himself. Or maybe this movie is a savage indictment of the Danish legal system, where it seems you can be sacked for unspecified charges with no right of response, and we are supposed to go along with his infuriating silence. The Hunt is certainly a savage portrayal of Danish mob psychology and political correctness gone mad, but the script clumsily constructs the events that allow this to happen.The final scenes are also problematic, with an unlikely ending given all the events that preceded it. As a gripping piece of social realism, ultimately The Hunt fails the reality test, and a good script editor might have been able to turn this very good movie into a great one."
38,The Hunt,9,15 August 2013,Feel Suffocated...,"Human brain controls everything. Prove yourself by watching this movie. There is no action, no thrill in this but discover yourself as suffocated with some emotional or mental pressure. This film creates an amazing emotion or feelings for an innocent man and makes you suffocated.A superb movie. I really learned something from this movie, that ""rethink"". And make your belief real strong on your best friend. I really love the silence of that movie and the personality of the leading character- ""Lucas"".Thank you so much Thomas Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm for such story and direction."
39,The Hunt,9,1 May 2013,"Essential viewing for all teachers, parents and school children","There cannot be enough words to express the importance of this film. Not only beautifully and skillfully crafted but 'Jagten' is equally a profound warning that immense mistakes are currently being made which persistently erode the natural upbringing of our children and permanently ruin the lives of thousands of innocent people who are wrongfully accused of abusing them. As such this film should be mandatory viewing in all schools and for everyone involved with children.Lucas is an assistant at a primary school serving a small rural community in Denmark. He is approached by the 6 year old daughter of his best friend because she has an interest in walking his dog. A friendship forms and she idolizes him to the extent that one day she presses a kiss upon his mouth and gives him a small plastic heart. Perhaps rather insensitively, but nonetheless quite understandably in today's manic society, he returns her gift and carefully tells her that kisses on the mouth are reserved for her parents. She feels rejected and offended and accordingly suggests to the headmistress that he had behaved improperly to her by displaying his genitals and giving her the token that she had in fact given to him.And then the horrific reality of today's paranoid obsession over pedophilia takes hold with devastating effects on everyone involved. Instead of questioning the girl a little more to test the truth of events, instead of making background checks into the suspect's past or even placing him under discrete observation, the child is automatically believed and her accusation broadcast around the entire community. Even when she withdraws her allegation and admits it to be false she isn't believed because of the absurd notion that victims will attempt to protect their abusers. Lucas isn't told the identity of his accuser or even the details of her allegations. He is simply suspended from work and isolated from everyone around him. The resulting drama makes compulsive viewing that forces us all to examine our own reactions to such situations. The self important and arrogant Headmistress who instigates the tragedy is an all too common figure in all our communities and perhaps a character that represents far more danger to the healthy upbringing of our children than those she is supposedly protecting them from. Our children must feel safe and confident when communicating with adults but the pedophilia paranoia around them serves to isolate the generations into separate communities that bodes extremely ill for the future of society."
40,The Hunt,9,11 January 2013,"""Do you seriously think I hurt her?""","Lucas(Mikkelsen doing incredible, and his role, fortunately, in spite of early indications towards it, is *not* a Gary Stu) is a fairly content 42-year-old. His biggest problem is his ex-wife only letting him see their son every other weekend, and after he whines(seemingly an exorbitant amount, even for a teenager), this gets changed. So things are looking up. But then, he faces an accusation of pedophilia, and as things escalate(eventually leading to a few holes punched in the overall credibility), the tension rises(thankfully occasionally pierced(never disappearing completely), made tolerable, by the clever humor - such as our lead's dog barking at every mention of the name of his former bride), and as we realize how easily this could happen to us, we can't escape the terrifying consequences of such a claim... even when it is false. It is completely evident to us that it is not true, and it is about this situation. This does not suggest that the awful crime never happens, but it does shine a light on the fact that we are looking for it everywhere, and many refuse to accept the court's word when someone is found to not have done it. Part of the problem is the idea that we are ""innocent"" until puberty, and our still strained relationship with sexuality. Let me make clear, it should of course never be between kids and adults... however, even at a young age, there may be curiosity, and this is not a bad thing, it's natural and should not be discouraged(lest they actually *do* get issues about it!). The characterization has no one a ""good or bad guy"", we understand everyone and their actions. And the acting is impeccable from everyone concerned. Theo(Bo Larsen, capturing the complexity) is forced to choose between who to believe... his best friend since childhood, or his beloved daughter! And the girl herself, Klara(Wedderkopp, who shows amazing talent... when she is asked to repeat her story to a therapist, we perceive her increasing nervousness through a minor tic with her lower lip; no words needed, and holding up to the scrutiny of close-ups), is as full and real a person as if she were a grown-up. The score is sparse and this uses silence well, rendering it more intimate. We start in the idyllic(the whole thing is set in a small town, and in addition to being ""short"" or ""code"" for witch-hunt, the title can be applied literally), with everyone happy, everything quaint, and as it progresses, this gets further away, to the point where we begin to wonder if we imagined that. The pace does at times drag a tad, and the third act doesn't feel entirely like a climax(in spite of how scary it gets over the course of the 112 minutes). While I have mixed feelings about the very ending, it is in the right spirit. This is a mature, intelligent take on the subject, and will stir up a much-needed debate. Thomas Vinterberg has made another film as good as The Celebration(and I love Submarino). There is a lot of disturbing content, some bloody violence, and brief male full frontal nudity(and references to such) in this. I recommend this to everyone who can ""handle it"". 9/10"
41,The Hunt,10,21 October 2012,"Excellent film like his previous Submarino (2010), both leaving me behind with a depressed feeling","I saw this film at the Ghent filmfestival 2012. I was not sure about booking tickets because of the synopsis suggesting a depressing story line full of prejudices and hostility within the confines of a small village. Such themes about a mindless crowd are shown before in several other books and movies. On the other hand, I was very impressed with Submarino from the same film maker, that I saw in 2010 (also in Ghent). It left me no choice but to go and see for myself. And for the whole 111 minutes it went very well, I must admit in hindsight. But the depressive thoughts with which I left Submarino in 2010, came over me here as well, both cases possibly demonstrating what this film maker thinks about mankind as a species.The story can be told in a single sentence: Teacher in kindergarten is falsely accused of indecencies with a 5-year old girl, the whole village shuns him and refuses any further contact, the police is involved in the matter, and he looses his job and all former friends as a result. There is a sub-plot about his divorce and the inherent struggles about seeing their children, especially his adolescent son. None of these themes are novel, but read on.For a lot of reasons, this film is positively different. In addition to very commendable casting and acting, there is much more what makes this one stand out. Firstly, very revealing to me was the way the allegedly abused child was questioned. Some words the girl picked up the day before from her adolescent brothers, were taken very literally, and the interview progressed along tendentious lines from thereon. Secondly, though the girl in question said more than once that she had said dumb things about the accused teacher, it was explained to her that people often suppress negative experiences as a mechanism to protect themselves.And thirdly, last but not least, some doubts that a few people had about the accusations, were reasoned away and not followed up due to social pressure. It shows that not all people think in black and white all the time. We see even unsympathetic figures in the story behave naturally and logically, as humans from flesh and blood, with more dimensions that just one, representing more than mindless members of a mob.(**Mini spoiler nr 1 ahead**) Halfway the film we see that the police arrests him, but has to set him free a few days later. A house search revealed that the cellar that all interviewed children had described in much detail, does not exist at all. For the police this casts enough doubt on the accusations. But the village is not convinced and continues to shun him. A hefty confrontation in the local supermarket demonstrates his isolation to its full extent.(**Mini spoiler nr 2 ahead**) The film ends with a seemingly happy and harmonious scene, one year later, amidst festivities when the son of our main character receives his hunting license. Father and son appear integrated again in village life. But while alone in the woods for a moment, waiting for his son to shoot his first deer, we still observe him being haunted by thoughts about being cornered and threatened. It shows us very clearly that intense experiences do not fade away easily.All in all, my initial hesitations proved totally wrong, and I enjoyed the whole movie from beginning to the end, notwithstanding the depressive insights in mankind that were shown. I scored a 5 (out of 5) for the audience award when leaving the theater. And I promise myself to keep an eye on further products of this same film maker, and not again hesitate to book tickets when the time comes."
42,The Hunt,9,7 September 2013,"Great story, characters and picture. An excellent European movie.","I've heard of ""The Hunt"" (""Jagten"") for some time now, and after a few attempts of watching it, I finally did it. After I have seen the movie, I have a big regret: that I've waited so long to do it.""The Hunt"" has a wonderful story, which feels very real and plausible. The events are happening in a small town near the mountains, where the community is very close to each other. The pictures are beautiful: mountains, rivers, lakes, wild animals and great buildings. Even the food looks very good.But what I liked the best were the people, and the relationship between them. I mean I felt like I was their friend: I laughed with them, I cried with them and felt numerous types of feelings while watching the film. It transmits powerful feelings through the screen. You never have enough information to form a complete idea or opinion, and that makes the movie even more interesting and teasing. You have many types of relationships: between friends, father and child, ex-husband and ex- wife, new lovers, and others. During the scenes, I have felt different types of feelings and emotions: joy, trust, anticipation, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise.I have learned a few things from this film, about people and the way they interact. First of all, people can be easily influenced and manipulated, when you have all the factors needed to create a necessary scenario. Second, a real friendship can't be broken, even if certain events tell you so: ""I think this is the ending of a beautiful friendship"" (opposite of the famous quote from Casablanca).Finally, I recommend ""The Hunt"" to all of you who love people and the connections that are made between them. I will wait for your comments in the Message Board, because at the end of the movie you will surely have many questions.P.S. This is my first review, so don't be to harsh on me."
43,The Hunt,9,15 August 2013,Emotions of a common man who is not guilty,"This is an excellent masterpiece from the director Thomas Vinterberg. Hats off to him for showing the emotions of a common man in such a wonderful way. I like to praise the protagonist Mikkelsen for his classic acting. Also I like the acting of the little girl who has done really well. There is really a nice message for everyone in this movie. I do want to write many things about this movie.You must have read so many reviews already about this film. So I don't want to reiterate again.So, please stop reading more reviews about this movie and just watch it.Trust me, you will love it."
44,The Hunt,10,31 July 2013,Very nearly cinematic perfection,"While we are forced to endure noise from the likes of Michael Bay and Co, movies like this one pass by unnoticed. This is filmmaking of a very high order and many will miss its subtleties and instead glob onto the drama of its main plot. This movie is closer to Ibsen and For Whom The Bell Tolls and The Scarlet Letter than it is to today's typical cinema. The initial 40 minutes or so are perfect in terms of acting, directing and writing. Maybe, just maybe, the film should have ended about 10 minutes earlier than it does--but the closing works very well too. The portrait of mankind here is grim, dark and well-deserved, sad to say."
45,The Hunt,10,31 July 2013,One little lie...,"***may contain a spoiler***...can certainly destroy...The Hunt (Jagten in Danish) is about a kindergarten teacher named Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) after a messy divorce is getting his life back together though having problems with his ex while entering a new relationship with Nadja (Alexandra Rapaport). Life seems to be on a gradually upbeat swing for Lucas until one day while playing with his students young Klara (beautifully portrayed by Annika Wedderkopp) kisses him on the mouth while slipping a note into his pocket. Even though immediately having a chat with the little girl about kissing another adult (other than her mother and father) and the note (to which she flatly denies doing), he's accused of molesting her when she tells the principal Grethe (Susse Wold) the most damaging of all accusations - that Lucas exposed himself (i.e. showed his penis) to her. Now granted the principal had her doubts about the matter yet she pursues the matter by bringing in a child psychologist/DCFS-type worker to question Klara which not only has the lie spiraling out of control but it has other parents claiming their children were also molested by Lucas after holding a meeting with them. This truly doesn't bode well for him since Klara is the daughter of his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) and his wife Agnes (Anne Louise Hessing). Yet during the course of this, Klara does admit she said something stupid ...that he (Lucas) didn't do anything. However, since the lie is seen as the truth, the adults think she's experiencing a case of Stockholm Syndrome or lying because she feels some sympathy towards her accuser.Besides showing how a child's little lie after being taken as a truth by everyone directly and indirectly involved, it also demonstrated how an accusation could instantly effect the alleged abuser and his family thus changing their lives throughout the course of the film. Not only does he lose his job at the kindergarten school and his girlfriend, Lucas loses the trust and friendship from most of his friends except Brunn (Lars Ranthe), his son's (Marcus portrayed by Lasse Fogelstrom) godfather. No one wants to believe and/or help prove his innocence. And even after the court finds no evidence of abuse, he's still viewed as an child molester where he lives to the point everyone in town continues to ostracize him which also includes banning him from shopping at the local grocery store (as so ordered by the store manager) all because they believe he did what Klara accused him of doing. Mads Mikkelsen in the role of Lucas shows the moveigoer (especially during the heart-stopping conclusion of The Hunt) that he always will forever be the victim of little girl's innocence lie never caring that he was justly vindicated by the truth and court. This actor wonderfully demonstrated a wide range of emotions from disbelief and anger (when being accused of the alleged crime) to frustration and hopelessness (after being acquitted of all wrong) and more while remaining relatively calm for the sake of his son ...especially when someone viciously murders the family dog.In The Hunt, there seems to be three sides to the truth - Klara's, Lucas' and what the director reveals during the course of the movie. This reviewer liked the fact that director Thomas Vinterberg didn't waste most of the run time fluffing up the movie with unnecessary details (like showing the investigation with the other children or Lucas' police questioning and court appearance) which would painfully drag the movie down and drift away from its focus on the main character - Lucas. Without those scenes in place you don't really feel lost or that you're missing something from the plot because the director allows the somewhat fast paced timeline summarize what happened in between through his characters. For example, we don't realize Lucas has lost his job until the scene titled December but you do get that general feeling since he practically lives in a dark house and there's dirty dishes and clothes strewn everywhere when his son unexpectedly arrives at his door. Usually reserved for a thriller/horror film not a drama, Thomas wonderfully uses the element of surprise in this movie to heighten the intense movie-going experience with a few jarring, heart-stopping and panic moments that might have you clawing at your theater armrest. On the flipside, there are some funny moments - be on the lookout for Fanny the dog to bark whenever someone mentions the name Kirsten. It's hilarious. And (without trying to give too much away) through the use of the minor characters towards the end, he also gave you the sense that some were able (a) to forgive and forget, (b) forgive but not forget or (c) still hold a grudge ...from afar.If you want to see a thought-provoking drama and don't mind reading subtitles (though there are moments when it's in English), SouthSide highly recommends checking The Hunt (which has a limited theater viewing run)."
46,The Hunt,4,28 March 2013,"Silly, lazy scriptwriting","This could have been an interesting and important antidote to films such as the (excellent) 'The Woodsman', but was let down by a plot line that is too sensationalist rendering it unbelievable. The film starts well, with a slow but thoughtful introduction to Lucas played by Mads Mikkelson. We get to see his close relationship with his friends colleagues and kids he works with. The plot unravels when a child makes up a lie for the flimsiest of reasons, and then is interviewed with a string of leading questions, which are then not only believed, but expanded upon by professional trained adults. This simply wouldn't happen, and knowing this, I didn't connect with the rest of the film, despite some great performances. If you enjoy (and believe) what you read in the Daily Mail and Express, you might find this film to your taste."
47,The Hunt,3,7 June 2014,What did I just watch?,"About three quarters in this movie, I was wondering where was it going. This movie starts out making sense and interesting, then took a turn towards nonsense and madness. A resident of their town was accused of a crime and was basically charged with no proof. Even after there were strong signs that the man was innocent they were still attacking him, life is not fair but this movie took unrealistic to a new height. It was difficult for this movie to make sense and it become very annoying after awhile due to its nonsense. The lead actor did a good job playing his part, but storyline is nonsense. As a result I give it 3 stars. In reality an accused and innocent man would stand up for his rights and not allow himself to be taken advantage of such as what we see here."
48,The Hunt,9,3 January 2013,a witch hunt,"By parroting a bawdy description of Lucas, her schoolteacher, a little girl unwittingly persuades the officious headmistress that he has molested her. The suspicion snowballs. After an unofficial debriefing in which the interrogator blatantly leads the young witness, the school refers the matter to the police. The authorities don't find any basis to prosecute the alleged abuse, but this means little to a town with a lynch mob mentality. Dogged by suspicion, Lucas finds his livelihood upended, his relationships strained, and his peace menaced. Wise beyond her years, the student admits her foolishness and proclaims the teacher's innocence, but this falls upon dead ears. Lucas' so-called accuser is the daughter of his so-called best friend, but that friend won't be the one to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least not before Lucas has gone through an awful lot of grief.The depiction of Lucas' persecution is compelling (as long as one suspends disbelief and accepts that parents and administrators are dumb enough to believe the kids will gaily horse around with a serial molester the way they do with Lucas). No one will watch this film without acquiring a renewed sense of the importance of due process and the presumption of innocence. However, it glosses over what, to my mind, could have been the most interesting part of the tale: Lucas' reconciliation with and reintegration into his community. What could heal the wounds of an innocent man so cruelly mistreated? How could he ever trust the people around him again knowing that they can turn on him ruthlessly without him doing anything at all? If the film had offered a convincing portrait of how this was possible, it might have been a transcendent work instead of just an excellent film. The closing scene recapitulates one of the most unnerving episodes of Lucas' ordeal, starkly calling into question the idea that Lucas and his community have forgiven and moved on. That ending adds poignancy to the question of how those involved have attempted to come to terms with the injustice done to Lucas, but answers are only subtly hinted at. I, like many viewers, would also have found some satisfaction in seeing any of Lucas' tormentors besides the butcher (say, the headmistress or Fanny's killer) get some comeuppance. The film does not vouchsafe us this satisfaction. Perhaps the point is that Lucas is victimized by a mob, not by individuals who choose rationally and can be held accountable."
49,The Hunt,7,6 December 2012,Stalking innocence,"Some movies don't hit you straight away. I came away from The Hunt (Jagten) disappointed by the obviousness of its messages; frustrated by its conservative form; and irritated by its predisposition to sympathy (the quickest shortcut to audience response). But after reflecting upon the film, these elements have coalesced, and now I see them as combining to create a film of clarity, psychological depth (particularly in relation to group dynamics), and understanding of the human condition. I still think it's more concerned with sympathy than empathy at times, but there is a boldness to this approach which will hopefully see the film appeal to a wider audience.Mads Mikkelson excels as the schoolteacher, Lucas, who in a single month goes from kids' favourite to community outcast, after the daughter of his best friend accuses him of sexually abusing her. Klara feels neglected - but there's no doubt that she'll get plenty of attention now. The film reminds us that children lie and deceive in order to feel loved. Klara isn't manipulative, just lonesome. It's the adults who manipulate - sometimes themselves - in order to satisfy their own inadequacies, as well as uphold their own myths about the children in their care: innocence and absolute virtue, as if we're born that way. Ironically, through our sentimentalising of children, it is children who've become the outcasts, compartmentalised from the rigours of reality, treated as a different species.This is a quietly important film for these times of wildfire rumour and networked innuendo - one which goes some way to adding some grey to the black and white relationship between adults and children."
50,The Hunt,10,25 July 2015,Oh my word. This is a masterpiece. This is legit a masterpiece.,"(Before I start, anyone reminded of The Crucible watching this?) The thing most viewers loved about the film was how great the story was. But something I would like to point out and why I say this film is masterful is because you can analyze this film to its core and it gets better and better - not the other way around - and that is something that you can almost never do with most films. That alone is a sign of great writing and directing, and that is of great credit to Thomas Vintenberg and Tobias Lindholm for crafting a consistent tightly-knit story revolving around such a touchy subject, and to those wondering about the name, it very nicely reflects the phrase ""witch-hunt"", which is what people are doing in the film.As you've probably read/heard by now, the story is about a teacher who is falsely accused of a horrendous act. Now, even though that is the key point, what the story is really about is how something as simple as the belief in a child's innocence and a few words can get people to completely turn on a person, no matter how irrational or unfair or evil they are being in doing so, in this fit of mass hysteria and paranoia. It's about how terrible social justice and opinion is, and even worse, how terrible it can be to be on the bad side of it. The film also touches on the relationships between people, especially friendships, and how situations like this put these things to the test. It presents how events like these reveal a certain disgustingly maddening aspect of human nature that you would never really imagine to be there, and in that sense, it becomes a fascinating study on human behavior, and from this spawn the debates of many many viewers attempting to make sense of everything. And all of this is gradually built and developed, immersing you more and more, which is crazy because you already start off very well immersed. Multiple times during the film, you feel like you have reached an ultimate low view of humanity and the peak of passionate rage, and then it keeps going and going! You will be on the verge of tears! Now this cannot be achieved without near-perfect acting performances from everyone in the cast, not just the main characters. Mads Mikkelson pulls off one of the greatest performances I've ever seen from this type of character. Every line of dialogue he says not only is so well written but is so well reflected in the performance. I can recall many moments during the film wherein the way he acted is exactly how I've seen people in somewhat similar circumstances. And what's so great about both the acting and character of Mads Mikkelson is that he's not just some clichéd utterly vulnerable guy. No, he actually has some strength and pride to him, and he won't just take all the bull!@#$ that comes to him. I loved it! There were so many satisfying moments that came of that. Thomas Bo Larson also completely encompasses a best friend who is being internally pulled apart by the situation, and by the time we see him complete his arc, his character is imprinted in the minds of the viewers as one of the great aspects of the film. And as honorable mentions, I have to say that all the child actors felt refreshingly real and EVEN THE DOG! There was especially one scene where you are not even sure if the dog is legit doing what is being seen or is some kind of movie magic being pulled off here.Now, in this kind of story, the ending is something that writers must do well to avoid being either too unsatisfactory for the viewer or too good to be true. And I'm glad to say that the ending is probably as good as the rest of the film. Part of the genius of the ending is that not only does it leave you thinking about it, but it forces you to reflect back on the entire film, which aside from adding to the mastery of the film, further helps to promote the film as a whole. One can say that the way the ending skipped over a period of time was a bit lazy in writing, and it maybe got a bit sappy, but if you think about what happens at the very end, all of that is very well justified because it was to conveys a certain message which you, the viewer, may interpret different than others (do not mistake this, though, as one of those open-endings some films do, not that that is necessarily bad but is usually done out of laziness and lacks thought and effort).Another thing worthy of note is the cinematography and shot composition. While there were a few moments where the camera wobbled and took the viewer slightly out of the world, the rest of the film is brilliantly filmed and shot. Certain shots are held static and focused on the subject of the shot to add onto the emotion of the scene, and along with the way they are composed, whether the character is being filmed in nature or in a house, fits perfectly in this world set up by the film.I never expected to be so immersed, so riveted, so emotionally hit by this film, but I was. I was actually nearly in tears at one point. This film will take you through an emotional roller-coaster and will leave you exhausted! I salute Thomas Vintenberg, Tobias Lindholm, and the entire cast for their excellence in this film. What a great film."
51,The Hunt,8,16 August 2013,An autopsy of group dynamics (Part 1),"The aim of this text is to provide clarification on certain misconceptions I have stumbled on reading through critiques of ""The Hunt""(2012), as a good way to elaborate upon them by contributing my personal analysis of the main themes the film seems to tackle. Indeed, a certain number of commentaries just don't do justice to a pretty tightly knotted film, which is for that matter devilishly efficient at making its points. This is not a review in the conventional sense (value judgment, stylistic and formal commentary) and is therefore mostly addressed to people having already seen the film.""It creates a scarecrow story filled with innuendo and partial truths that feed on people's empathy only to turn an innocent young girl into a potential object of rage and abuse."" Film Unintentionally Criticizes ItselfAuthor: in1984 from United States 29 May 2013One should never assume too much about the spectator's conditioned responses. Indeed, it is natural to be revolted by a lie, but there are limits to questioning children's intentions, as these are often incapable of moral evaluation, can with difficulty measure the consequences of their actions or even grasp the semantic implications of their words or words in general. Children, as it is, fall more often than not prey to their own misunderstandings. Besides, Klara's intentions seem to be quite clear and exposed as such by the film : incapable of confronting rejection (from Marcus) of which emotional impact has been amplified by her situation of momentary familial negligence, Klara's contempt is released through the fabrication of a story derived from discontinuous bribes of prior traumatic experience (impromptu vision of a man's genitalia on an ipad waved carelessly in front of her eyes). But the film's emphasis is first and foremost on the manner this dubious story (patch-up job of a child's brain) is progressively being reinforced by the adults to achieve full credibility, coherence and impact : the adults pressing causal logic against what was ingenuous hotchpotch.""The plot unravels when a child makes up a lie for the flimsiest of reasons, and then is interviewed with a string of leading questions, which are then not only believed, but expanded upon by professional trained adults. This simply wouldn't happen, and knowing this, I didn't connect with the rest of the film, despite some great performances."" Silly, lazy scriptwritingAuthor: babarpapa from United Kingdom 28 March 2013The social helper seems genuinely to be in full agreement with Gretha, the school teacher, in a movement of common/natural consent that the frequency of this kind of affairs has conditioned as an almost automatic response. The presumption of innocence often fails to resist in the face of emotional charge. The sequence depicting the interview with Klara is one of the most important moments of the film. There is clear evidence of ""soft"" pressuring of the little girl by the social helper, in order not to seek a confession but rather to obtain confirmation for what has already been taken at face value. Thus, the girl's shaking of the head is almost immediately discarded as a sign of psychological repression. The point being that psychological theory can become a dangerous motor of influence when it serves as a doctrinal backbone for the truth eluding that the truth is in fact the by-product of the inertia of the largest number consensus, as it reveals itself in this telling moment of intimate surrounding where Klara confesses the lie to her mother which is discarded as being the result of mental confusion subsequent to trauma as the institutional explanation wants it to be. During the interview, the girl's ""no"" progressively morphs into a clear nodding of the head, without Klara being at any moment or in any way capable of rephrasing her own side of the story. Instead, it is the suggestion of the social assistant that bends her silence, extracting and building the official intrigue : ""He did this and that, in this or that way"", extrapolating on the teacher's account of the girl's story and validating on the way the ""facts"" with Klara's noddings. Indeed, if one can't make children do anything we want, in certain situations of emotional distress or contexts triggering emotional defensive attitude, children can be quite suggestible, induced in believing that things or events really happened to them. Furthermore, they have a tendency to amplify the adult's paranoia, to the extent that the social assistant suggestive powers are only the starting point of a movement that keeps worsening. One can easily imagine the parents unconsciously or carelessly dictating to their kids, in a similar way as the social assistant did with some sort of pseudo-maïeutic method, abduction and sequestration scenarii drawn from shared knowledge of news items or any other support in which imagination and emotion can update/actualize realistic narratives in the counter-factual world of their discourses."
52,The Hunt,9,3 August 2013,The Hunt,"This movie is absolutely amazing! Mads Mikkelsen is pouring his soul out on screen and it pays off. He gets our empathy and we see the unfairness and beatings he must take on his journey to prove his innocent! I didn't really understand the title until the very end and i think the ending kind of opens the story, and therefor sits in my head and was stuck in there for a long time. As a Dane i think i would get the movie a little better than anybody else, because i live in the environment that we see, how gossip gets around in the small cities and suddenly is out of hands.. But an amazing movie it is, but not a 10, because of lack of action in my opinion."
53,The Hunt,10,21 July 2013,Exceptional and Disturbing,"We haven't come a long way from being caveman and witch hunting. Many people argue humans are capable of rational deductions and carrying inside of them the ability to forgive and understand. ""The Hunt"" explores just how much difference exists between members of the same community and/or the human/animal kingdoms.There are many beautifully done scenes in this film. ""The Hunt"" deals with a case where a man is unfairly accused of a heinous crime. As he learns, suddenly the community has turned on him. His closest buddies are now ready to beat him and his family both physically and emotionally. At the head of the lynch mob is a woman who professes love and kindness and is a member of the church community but who hesitates when trying to research the truth.It is a complex situation, as we see a victim who refuses to go down without proving his innocence, and he sees his world crumbling little by little, as he loses friendships, family, and maybe even his life. His best friend is at the heart of the situation, and he might be the only one who could listen, but he also has to watch for his family and live under the influence of a devastated mother. Interestingly, families in this movie. At least, the ones that we are allowed to see are broken, and this might explain the actions of a lonely child.As his life falls apart, life goes on, and in one of the more emotional moments in the movie, everyone is gathered at the community, during Christmas Eve, and this being the perfect moment for reaching and healing, things couldn't go any worse. It is a moment where faith and love are gone, and the results are explosive.The entire movie benefits from a masterful lead actor performance, but everyone here contributes his / her best to a story that reflects contemporary society, a mirror of the worst that has plagued us for centuries, and how we have learned so little from the past, and with the bone chilling ending shows there is little hope that things will be come better in the future. It's a slow moving film, but there is nothing boring in it, there is time to meditate, to react to a couple of intensely violent moments, and to learn that maybe we can get rid of some of the evil in the world, if we really try."
54,The Hunt,8,16 March 2013,Exceptional film from Denmark,"The Hunt is a harrowing, tough but compelling watch. The story of a forty year old teacher, Lucas is re-building his life after an acrimonious divorce. Popular at school, seemingly a natural with his young charges, and in the first flush of a romance with a pretty fellow worker, his world is turned upside down by an almost casual accusation by Klara, a young girl at the school, and the daughter of his best friend.The film documents Lucas's gradual descent into a living hell, dis-owned by everyone in a small close knit rural community, and a child trapped by her own lies, and her by her family's un- shaking willingness to believe her.Gripping, and well acted, particularly by Mads Mikkelson, who is exceptional as the wrongly accused Lucas, betrayed, angry, but sill fighting to preserve his dignity. This is a taut, well paced drama, a nightmare set amongst the beauty of the Danish countryside."
55,The Hunt,2,28 September 2013,more difficult to watch than any horror movie out there,"I congratulate myself for being able to get through this ordeal. I had to pause the movie three times out of anger and frustration with the main character, Lucas. He is so unrealistic and unhealthy as a human being that he actually deserves all that happens to him. He actually makes it happen. You can't afford to be an introverted drama queen when your life is on the line with such a serious accusation as child abuse. I mean, to work with people and have a sense of empathy and to handle the problem the way he did...totally wrong. And you can't say he did not see it coming. But it is a movie, and I'm guessing the director thought ""Never mind logic and how a normal human being would have handled the situation, let us put on a show !"" I was cringing every time Lucas just stood and stared, avoided communication or threw a tantrum. I mean...how indifferent ( or overly confident ) to your own well being can you be to act so childish ? Of course people will understand you wrong. It made no sense. Never mind."
56,The Hunt,3,17 September 2013,"Disturbing, but not necessarily in the way that it's meant to be...","A society of boorish alcoholics, who seem desperate to get away from their wives, to ""socialise"" in large groups, whilst out hunting. A society in which the highest aspiration is to own a gun, and go out hunting... a society which believes that a boy becomes a ""man"" when he finally gets his own rifle, aged sixteen. A society willing to turn on anyone they don't like, in which there hardly seem to be a single happily married couple, and in which all the children are hyperactively, and brainlessly aggressive at all times...Seriously. Forget the ""lie"". This film shows us a truly rotten society. There's no surprise just how willing they are to turn on one of their own number. This is one of the most neanderthally crude communities I've ever witnessed, and I'm sure they would need no excuse to ostracise anybody that didn't conform, let alone someone they suspect of being a child molester. Killing a dog for them would just be another day in the park.To me, this film, if you ignore it at face value, and really examine the society being depicted, is truly worrying, and if I was Mads Mikkelsen, fitting in would be the last thing that I'd want. I'd want to get out, and fast. The most worrying thing about the story itself, is just how shaky it is. It's a reasonably compelling storyline, definitely, and it's difficult to argue with the acting, which has been universally praised. In a film that exists to be grim and challenge subjects guaranteed to offend, it's important to analyse just what you're being told. In this film, the message seems to be, that it's impossible to prove, one way or the other, whether a child has been sexually abused. In the film, that point is glossed over, in favour of the paranoia which even the hint of scandal produces. But in the end, I'm disturbed by the way this story is presented. It takes one side of the story - that children never lie - and critiques that, making us believe the contrary. I'm sorry, but if a child comes up to you ,and tells you that she's seen a grown man's willie, then don't ignore her, like this film seems to encourage you to. The reasoning behind this deus ex machina is very shaky, but that's irrelevant. The fact that Lucas; A) Never denies this openly , and B) then gets away with it, seem to drive this point home. In spite of what I said earlier, the people in this community are absolutely justified in persecuting Lucas, because everything points towards him. So why do dozens of other children suddenly admit to supposedly false accounts of abuse at Lucas' hands? Again, another clunky plot point, smokescreen to allow Lucas to get away with the whole thing, which he wouldn't have if it had just been an isolated case. Children lie all the time, this film says. Don't believe them. That's pretty messed up.So why do we need an art house film, telling us how easy it is to get away with abusing children? One wonders. A story about an evil community turning on one guy they think is a sick pervert. I'm sorry to bring this up, because I do think Mads Mikkelsen is a great actor, but I wouldn't trust him - I mean, why hire someone who's made a career out of playing uniquely sinister, unsavoury villains, to play Mr. Normal Guy?Another mark of bad scripting, is people behaving in totally ridiculous fashions, and for a film all about tightly written, supposedly ""realistic"" society, this is something of a handicap. If someone tells you they've been accused of molesting children, then you do not laugh (like Lucas' girlfriend does.) If someone accuses YOU of molesting children, you protest vociferously. You do not sit there for thirty seconds thinking (like Lucas does.) There is no reason for Lucas to kick his girlfriend out when he does, other than so we can have Lucas as a totally isolated character, with no-one to turn to, just because she asked if he really was a child molester. Also, the grocery shopkeeper's policy of ""We don't serve your kind here"", is quickly amended to ""We don't serve your kind here, unless we kick the stuffing out of you, then you come back in and then head-butt me in the face"". Yeah, like that's going to help your case at all.Also, another moral objection to the film, is that it features strong animal cruelty moments, which I'm sorry, but I don't care how good your film is, it doesn't justify you hurting, or in this case, killing, an intelligent life form. We see a deer getting shot dead for real, to show what a nice conformist Lucas is, and we see a real dead dog being buried in a moment of nastiness.Also, I think, again outside the box, that it's unfair for Annika Wedderkopp, a sterling actress at her age, to have to say some of the things that she does, and be engaged in a film with such an unpleasant topic.In conclusion, then, what I respect about this film, is that it is intelligently made. It does have exceptional acting, of a sort rarely seen in today's movies. But what I object to, is the film's moral obscurity, which is anything but mature. It's an okay idea, rather clumsily executed. It is a bleak film, but not necessarily in the very heavy handed force feeding of tragic human drama we're presented with here. This is a film with a brain, no soul, no heart and very little in the way of morality. It also has a totally cop-out fairytale ending, which, if you forget the final shot (the reality), can be summed up in two very simple words; ""It's Christmas."""
57,The Hunt,10,30 June 2016,The Hunt - An intriguing look into the human condition,"The first thing I thought when I saw Mads Mikkelson on the poster for The Hunt was ""Hey, isn't that the bad guy from Casino Royale!"" Better known by many for the aforementioned role as well as the titular role in the hit show Hannibal, it would be an understatement to say that Mikkelson bypassed his usual typecast, villainous demeanour with this one. Portraying the life of a divorced father and caring nursery teacher, he elicits the kind of positivity and warmness I felt when watching characters such as C.C. 'Bud' Baxter, played by Jack Lemmon, in The Apartment. He is passive and quirky but ultimately lonely, and this separation sharply contrasts his day to day life, where he is surrounded by playful kids, responsible teachers and the warm environment of nursery school that we as kids can all remember.The Hunt surprised me with the level of engagement I found myself in throughout the movie. Nominated for Best Foreign Language film at the 86th Academy awards, this film explores the damaging and sometimes, as evidenced, irreparable, consequences that an 'innocent' lie can have on someone. I say 'innocent' because Klara, the main juvenile girl, initially makes up lie about Lucas (Mikkelson) that he sexually abused her at the nursery. She appears fully cognizant of her wrongdoing at first. She had a crush on Lucas. She made this quite clear (she goes to hold Lucas's hand at the beginning, gives him a kiss during playtime etc.). He told her that her actions are ""only for your mom and dad"", an appropriate response to a child in the midst of an adult crush. She would then proceed to make up a fib out of sheer anger and heartache. Until this point, the tone of the movie is lighthearted and almost like a bit of a rom-com; Lucas's life is slowly on the upswing with his family and love life. With this accusation, the movie then depicts the magnitude that the wrong words can have on a person. It also shows what can happen when such an accusation is handled by the wrong people.This movie is excellent in many ways. The dialogue, the acting, the pacing, the story. Thomas Vinterberg is a director who I was unaware of prior to watch The Hunt. In this film, he delivers a powerful take on the human condition, subtly and yet masterfully transitioning the tone from hopeful to hopeless with finesse. The subject of child abuse is a sensitive one and Vinterberg's many techniques help us deeply understand and feel for the characters, even when there is a lack of dialogue. For characters like Klara and Mikkelson, their eyes often say more than their mouths do; their silence is a proverbial onion which help us to peel back their many layers. This is very powerful when executed properly.There are two things that fascinated me about The Hunt. Firstly, Mikkelson's performance as an isolated, powerless man was one of the best I've experienced in a long time. In arguably his best role to date, Mikkelson gives an extremely moving and poignant performance as a lonely man with a heart of gold. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body. When you remember that this is a man who we has become known for playing inherently bad guys in other movies, it makes this enactment all the more impressive.This movie also featured many scenes that were seemingly unimportant or random to the overall plot, which would become instrumental in shaping the story. One scene in particular, that I had originally not given much thought to, was in the beginning when Lucas is speaking with Theo (played by Thomas Bo Larsen) about his son and ex-wife. Theo asks how Lucas is handling all of it, to which Lucas claims he is fine. Theo responds by saying ""I can tell when you're lying. You're eye twitches"". Later on in the movie, when Lucas is telling the truth about his innocence, Theo cannot distinguish what is a lie from the truth. Like his daughter, Theo's perception becomes distorted by outside events.The Hunt is one of the best foreign films I have seen in a long time, as it is carried out in a very realistic manner. Evil exists everywhere in our world; like an ubiquitous cancer that can never be fully eradicated. It becomes all the more complicated when children's imagination prevail over the truth.Most of all this movie makes you consider and stress over the perils of such a circumstance. This film made me question many things. Children are very candid and therefore will speak their mind. But what happens when, like Klara in The Hunt, their imagination prevails over their logic? This movie will make many people think, if this happened to any of them, ""How would I respond to it all?"""
58,The Hunt,9,6 December 2015,A moving and haunting experience,"No movie in history has ever made me feel so mad, so furious wanting to absolutely rage. I was some way into this film and I thought 'these people are driving me insane, I just want to yell and scream and trash this room!' I looked at the remaining time left on the film (because it was late) and there was still an hour and 10 minutes remaining, I was so close to turning it off thinking I have had enough, but I continued to watch. Luckily so it seemed, because a majority of the situations/individuals that caused my anger and frustration had slipped away. But then this grey cloak tarnishes the atmosphere and you're left with a longing feeling of despair and hopelessness, but only partially, but even if no hope remains, you still must watch this journey unfold. The atmosphere in this film is intense and gripping, the scenes consume you and you are fully absorbed within this story. And the movie takes a turn from this man in a battle where the opponent has absolutely no reason for attacking, to this man who is being attacked and there is nothing he can do about it, though not for a second do you think 'just give in', there isn't a inkling of that, its just 'I must watch this unfold' and bare witness. This is probably one of the most moving, intense, emotional movies I've seen, in recent memory and it's funny I think back on the movie and its not like I even enjoyed the experience, but it was exactly that; an experience. This will send you to tears; I wailed to this movie like none before. The atmosphere, the direction, the acting, the lighting, the dialogue, it creates this world that you see in your own life, you see across the street, the next town across, not just the locations, but the people. And maybe that's why I initially tell myself and think of telling others 'I didn't like that movie', because it is so real, it depicts life's struggles and humanity's flaws unbelievably well. This movie is not for the faint hearted. Its moves you in ways that not many things can, this is an emotional roller coaster, from madness to tears to joy to fear. I will say this; this movie is not one you should watch late at night before bed, this might not be a movie a lot of people should watch at all. But by god this is a movie! I haven't seen anything like it before and it left such an impact I don't know if I'll watch anything like it again.Be wary before watching this film, it's not for everyone."
59,The Hunt,10,9 October 2015,A Matserpiece,"For surely this film makes a statement, beautifully and simply presented. And Mads Mikkelsen is surely one of the most distinguished actors there is bar none.Photography was presented in stark and realistic colors. I felt I was there with this lonely man in his isolation. Director let his actors, all of them, play simplicity at its finest. Even the children. Hard to believe they were even acting they were so realistic. But it is the writers, director and Mr. Mikkelsen that tear your heart out (more then once). I felt every minute was filled with the desperation and loneliness of this man. Oh yes, I cried out for him and his torment. Mikkelsen didn't make it an earth shattering emotional moment. He did more. He lived the role and became the man himself. Such artistry is only to be praised. After all simplicity is the greatest force there is - and Mikkelsen's got it. An Oscar worthy performance in my eyes and heart."
60,The Hunt,7,9 August 2015,Decent drama with certain highlights.,"'Jagten' is mostly filmed as a rather middle of the road, decent drama, and even the core content (child abuse) does not change much about that. But the story has some strong moments that felt quite original. As such, there is the way Lucas fights back, as does his son Marcus. Then, there is the ending, which really threw me off, and still puzzles me. The same goes for more moments in the film (why was nobody able to link Klara's inappropriate talk to her brother?).The acting was over-all very good and natural, though here and there it felt a bit over the top, mostly by Thomas Bo Larsen, but it could have something to do with Thomas Vinterberg's direction as well.A good film, one that offers plenty to think about, but I was hardly blown away. A good 7 out of 10."
61,The Hunt,9,25 October 2013,Intelligent sensitive and thought provoking,"This film deals with a difficult subject and the way to be accused of something can be enough for you to be excluded by society. The film is well written,acted and produced.The pace of the film is excellent and never sensationalist.When so many films nowadays require the viewer simply to sit back and be entertained this film drags you through a moral maze and very straight forwardly forces you to deal with the issues raised. Due to the subject matter it cannot said to be enjoyable yet as a piece of film making it is important and to be praised.The performance of the central character binds the film together. Without having empathy for his character and for all of those caught up in the unfolding events the film would not work.The sanctity of childhood and the way that his son is at the same time also ostracised by the community provides a harrowing contradiction.""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned""."
62,The Hunt,9,23 October 2013,Hard to watch because it could happen to anyone,"It could happen to anyone, to a young child, to the parent's of that young child, or to the child's teacher.But I have to take issue with the statement in the description of the movie given by IMDb: ""...his (the main character's) new luck is about to be brutally shattered by an innocent little lie."" The film deals with a witch hunt that ensues after a five-year-old makes a comment about the child's favorite teacher.That the child's parents react by launching a community-wide witch hunt is not surprising given that the safety of their child seems to be at stake.That a possible criminal case, that lacks evidence and that is plagued on inconsistencies, can potentially ruin an innocent person's life isn't surprising either. Sadly, in the U.S. prosecutors have sent innocent people to death row with less evidence.Nor is it surprising that almost everyone involved, including the ""experts"", believe that ""Children don't lie.""But to characterize the comment that starts the firestorm as an ""lie"" is false.The accuser is a five-year-old; a five-year-old doesn't really understand the implications of a false statement. Five-year-olds may not know how to lie, but that's because a five-year-olds don't really know what a ""lie"" is, that is it not merely a false statement. Not knowing what a ""lie"" really is doesn't make the comment, which is really a statement, and not an accusation, ""innocent"".The ending is plausible, but I didn't like it. That's why I give the ""The Hunt"" a 9. The film does have a ""Mystic River"" quality about it (although the story lines of the two films are NOT similar). Even though the film is NOT graphic or explicit, and even though the alleged deed is minimally heinous as heinous deeds go, the parents of small children may not want to see this film."
63,The Hunt,8,22 October 2013,Αppearances can be deceptive...,"""The Hunt"" is a danish film which I think that it's one of the best films that Mads Mikkelsen has played.Mads Mikkelsen (Lucas) plays as a divorced teacher who lives a lonely life and he has some problems with his ex-wife that impacts to their son. After that his life is going to be better for some time as he finds the love from his son but all of these are going to change when something else happen.I think that ""The Hunt"" is a very good film and I have to say that Mads Mikkelsen performance was really great. Thomas Bo Larsen (Theo) makes an also good performance as best friend of Mads Mikkelsen."
64,The Hunt,4,27 November 2012,Plot would have been a lot better,"I cannot believe that Danish, Scandinavians at least, don't have the acknowledgment to handle matters at least on education and child psychology.All people involved in the plot, make tragic, childish mistakes. No-one acts like an adult. Like a calm, educated adult, watching and listening at both sides before making a decision. A shallow approach on the subject. I would expect a deeper analysis on dialogs and characters. I couldn't make a connection from one decision of a scene to another. What happens here seems way far from reality.Acting was just fair. Nothing special here."
65,The Hunt,5,4 January 2013,JAGTEN script disappoints,"Jagten (2012) Director Thomas Vinterberg tells a story of a kindergarten teacher, who is accused with an innocent little lie by one of his pupils. This ignites a violent reaction in a small community. Jagten is a film about friendship and how the bond between two friends can be frustrated. Still this bond is also the key for rehabilitation. Real friends will always see the truth in each others eyes.Yet this film never becomes really interesting. Lucas (Mads Mikkelson) remains a pathetic little man. He remains an inert puppet trapped in his own impotence to change. The character remains stoically and has only one emotion. More en better dialog could have given this story further deepening and the torment of the false accusation should have been better develop.Ultimately, this film does not manage to successfully tell a story. It is just a sad situation for this teacher. (seen on 3 Jan 2013 LantaarnVenster in Rotterdam, NL)"
66,The Hunt,9,19 November 2012,'The Hunt' is a gripping and achingly emotional film which will challenge and upset you and is sure to touch a nerve.,"'The Hunt' is the story of Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), a teacher who is well known and liked in the small community in which he lives. But this soon changes when he is wrongly accused of a crime.Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) is Lucas's best friend, and he's not coping too well with family life. Theo's troubled young daughter Klara (Annika Wedderkopp) seeks solace in Lucas and his dog Fanny. Karla oversteps their friendship, Lucas carefully rebuffs her but she interprets it as a rejection. Klara concocts a story that Lucas sexually abused her, and confides in her headmistress Grethe (Susse Wold) who mismanages the situation catastrophically. The school and the parents interrogate Karla, putting words in her mouth when she doesn't know what to say. Worst still, Grethe informs all the parents to look for signs of trauma in their children, and suddenly everyone begins to see signs of abuse that were never there, cue mass hysteria.We are forced to watch an innocent man bullied, persecuted and ostracised because of the nature of the accusation pointed against him. Lucas's demise contrasts with Klara's position, she's since said to her parents that Lucas was innocent, but they refuse to believe her. This is a world where the innocence of a child is never in question, and its an interesting tactic by director Thomas Vintenberg to show the accuser in a negative light, especially one so young. The opposite is the case for Lucas, who is shown as diligently honest and trustworthy. Lucas is helpless, whether he reacts or not he is seen as the guilty party. Only one person managed to listen to reason throughout the mass hysteria, his close friend Bruun (Lars Ranthe) offering Lucas unwavering support and some much needed pitch-black humour to cope with his ordeal.Lucas' witch-hunt reveals a community who are quick to resort to illogical and degenerate behaviours. Watching Lucas' story unfold is unbearably tense and extremely powerful. Yet nobody is demonised in the film, everyone has their own understandable motivations and this only increases the tension you feel. Facts are based on lies, gossip and innuendo, not to mention the power adults have over their children. Its also indicative of the paranoid herd mentality not only of adults but also of children, who all fashioned the same story to pin the blame on Lucas. The men in the community are all particularly close, they all including Lucas bonded week in week out like a band of brothers. To see all but one of them betray and remorselessly bully the mild mannered Lucas must have been traumatic, seeing Theo side with his daughter over him must have been devastating.The acting by the cast is superb, Mads Mikkelsen gives a deeply humanistic and scarring performance. Annika Wedderkopp handles a difficult part with an amazing maturity for one so young . Thomas Vintenberg has directed a near perfect film, 'The Hunt' is a gripping and achingly emotional film which will challenge and upset you and is sure to touch a nerve. You realise that this dark and terribly cynical film may be harsh, but its ultimately an indication that its all so very truthful and realistic, such is the world we live in."
67,The Hunt,9,18 January 2014,The scary thing is that this could happen to almost anyone...,"One of my favorite foreign language films it Thomas Vinterberg's ""The Celebration"" (""Festen""). It's an absorbing tale about sexual abuse--abuse that comes out during a birthday party for a beloved family patriarch. Now, with ""The Hunt"" (""Jagten""), Vinterberg directs a film where quite the opposite happens--a man is accused of sexual abuse but who is 100% innocent. Had the director always done films denying sexual abuse, folks might have thought him strange but here the brave director allows himself to go in a completely different direction with his movie.In his film, Mads Mikkelsen plays Lucas, a divorced father who works at a kindergarten. He seems like a genuinely nice man and is trying to get his life together. He has a new girlfriend, his son wants to come live with him and he has no reason to expect what happens. A very young girl is shown some pornographic material by some older boys and later in passing she tells another teacher that she has seen Lucas' penis when she actually didn't. Some folks investigate and ask leading questions--and suddenly there is a bit of hysteria as the community assumes Lucas is guilty--even his so-called friends. And, no matter what he does, he cannot PROVE he never did anything.So is the film any good? Well, based on it now being on IMDb's Top 250 list (at number 133), it's obvious a lot of folks loved the film. With a current score of 8.3, it's not at all surprising it would be nominated for the Oscar. As for me, I thought the film was terrific and thought-provoking. It made its point very well by using VERY vivid scenes involving the community literally tormenting Lucas. You can't help but feel affected by the drama--thanks to the script by Tobias Lindholm and Thomas Vinterberg himself.I did have one problem with the film--and this is why I didn't score it a 10. Although I think such a theme is great stuff for older kids and teens to watch with their folks, there are a few graphic scenes that were unnecessary for the film and which would probably make many of these parents not show the movie to their families. I think the kids need to see the violence against Lucas but the sex scene and photo weren't really needed in the film. A very light trimming would have made this a great film for ages 12 and older. Now, because it's rated R in the US, it's unlikely these younger viewers would get to see it. This film needs to be seen by a wide audience as it's very, very well made and worth seeing.By the way, in many ways, this film is like a dramatization of what occurred in the very famous McMartin Pre-School case here in America. Apparently, some very unqualified interviewers screwed up a case and soon had half the school accused of sexual abuse. Some of the stories they reported were downright insane (such as their victimizers being able to fly). Many folks were prosecuted and only later did folks realize what had occurred--a serious rush to judgment. And, as there was no real proof, the accused were all acquitted--but only after years and years of investigations and trials. And, in one case, one of the accused spent five years in jail despite no ultimate conviction.Also, if you are curious about me, I used to work with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators as a therapist. I am NOT minimizing sexual abuse claims in my review of the film. Too many women are ignored or treated like dirt when they are victims--I've seen this myself. It's just the unqualified and irresponsible interviews with very small children that bothers me. I've worked with many folks in the field and saw that most interviewers (at least back in the 1980s and 90s) were woefully untrained and potentially dangerous because of this."
68,The Hunt,9,24 November 2013,Rumor Mill,"This is a really tough movie to watch. I don't know how they do it, but keeping it ""real"" is not an issue with Mr. Vinterberg and others as it seems. Having a real situation that will throw you and others off balance and play it as straight as possible sounds simple, but it really isn't. You need actors like Mads Mikkelsen to convey the story and be able to portray all the facets of his character.The kid actors in this are very important too and as is said in the making of, none were told the whole truth or what the implications might be. Which is especially important to those who might think kids were exposed to things they shouldn't have been. Which brings us right back to the theme of the movie and the question, if we are over protective or if the world around us has changed too much? There are a lot of other questions too that are raised and not all can be answered with certainty or any satisfying result. Which makes the movie even more disturbing and good."
69,The Hunt,10,23 August 2013,Visually and Emotionally Greatttttt!!!!,"When I watched A Separation I started craving for more drama films (though I watch all kinda films but dramas-I just gotta see them right away). The setting of the film is awesome.The camera work is fantastic.The acting is great especially Mads Mikkelsen. Even the side actors have done a great job.It didn't seem wrong or fake why this person is reacting in this way.You'll want to kill a few people in this.But throughout the film I guarantee you,you'll be emotionally gripped. If you felt sorry for the guy in Bicycle Thieves, wait till you see this one. Great film!!"
70,The Hunt,8,19 August 2013,An autopsy of group dynamics (Part 2),"""All people involved in the plot, make tragic, childish mistakes. No-one acts like an adult. Like a calm, educated adult, watching and listening at both sides before making a decision. () I couldn't make a connection from one decision of a scene to another. What happens here seems way far from reality."" Plot would have been a lot betterAuthor: Dimitris Avramidis from Greece 27 November 2012The idea that cinema should reflect reality is fallacious, even if the film is built on mimetic ground and handles real-life like characters. The relationship of cinema to reality is actually a very difficult topic that can hardly be reduced to moral considerations or a measurement of a story's verisimilitude, in the sense that it would rely on generalization of everyday experience. Indeed, these would remove it from its specificities. ""The Hunt"" seeks to make a point and in this regard a certain generalization is here to serve the exemplary nature of its thesis, namely creating the frame in which to ""dissect"" and observe the social dynamics of group mentality and the psychological and moral conditionings that preside to responses of fear and culpability. The film is a tragedy in which unity of place and action are provided by a claustrophobic setting, a single village, a group, composed of a network of ties and connexions which the core/knot of the story is going to disturb and set in motion. It is erroneous however to claim that this ""literary"" predicate should undermine in advance the film to make any critical commentary on reality itself. In any country, we can find examples of what a witch hunt can look like when the embers of hate and paranoia are sufficiently fanned, especially in the context of highly volatile child abuse affairs.""As a teacher, firstly the whole premise of this film is that 'kids never lie' well I'm sorry but any teacher who's been in the job more than a day knows that kids lie all the time. Secondly the other kids would not just make stories up about being abused - and collaborate on a story; especially at a nursery."" I'm sorry but this was story was full of holesAuthor: robinabas2 from United Kingdom 18 April 2013This premise is however central to the understanding of the environment in which the tragedy takes place, namely a Danish small town setting the decor for a psychological drama behind closed doors. This is the narrative and mimetic contract on which the film relies, a microcosm cut off from the world where the idea of the purity and innocence of children responds to the desire of purity of the community, prolonged through its institutions. The title ""The Hunt"" thematises the relation to Nature and therefore Man to his animal drives, expressing the taboo forms of human attraction and the relation of society to the experience of ostracism (nay, the act to put to death) of an expiatory victim. Indeed, the ritual expulsion of a member of the group served in more traditional and autarkic societies as a measure to reinforce the feeling of unity of the group. The outcast Marcus is caught up in an atavic process of stigmatization of which the inertia seems ineluctable, as depicted in the final sequence of the film. In that sense, it is no coincidence if the film introduces the isotopy of ""ritual"", even before considering/testing its anthropological effects in/on the group. Marcus leads Klara, on several occasions, back home and on the way the little girl engages in a game of avoiding lines on the ground, thus keeping them in check like it would be hinted in a child's mental world of superstitious menace. These lines on the road, of which the avoidance constitutes the implicit recognition and acceptance of them as the structuring norms of the public and social space, seem to stand for symbols of the taboos and limits in a human group of individuals as well as symbols for the mental conditioning of its members. The childish game represents a rite of passage or prelude to it, giving the sense that the child is manuvering and negotiating her freedom/place through a maze of visible signs which express the invisible and incomprehensible abstract concepts of social functionality, social forbids,The innocence of children is not a premise that the film wants to force upon the spectator, but the psychological starting point of Gretha's opinion, soon a unilateral condemnation. And the collaborative story of abuse by the kids, as expressed in Part1, fits into the broader mechanisms of suggestion and parental paranoia. Innocence is a very important topic. The school teacher seems to be overwhelmed by her judgment, precipitation and for that matter gregarious instinct. When Lucas steps back into the school from which he has been evicted to confront her, she just opens the door and walks away, incapable of assuming directly the consequences of her actions. Her infantile reaction is a tacit plea for the innocence and absolution of the community at whole who needs through mechanisms of ostracism and victimization to reassert its health and viability, against an outer world of perversion, sexual deviance and violence. This psycho-anthropological conflict finds its most telling cathartic relief in the sacrificial sport of hunting. If Gretha confesses to the social helper she believes Klara has a fertile imagination, she flip-flops almost immediately by saying she has an intimate conviction she's not lying and therefore signs Marcus' definite act of culpability. Almost as if this were not the product of some mature or deontological reflection, but an act of faith, that is an act where believing prevails over rationality. If the film doesn't dwell on the unveiling of the deeper motivations of the school teacher, it is because its focus is on group dynamics. Indeed, the whole affair is bound on a tragical succession of events that the community - part unconsciously, part deliberately  refuses neither to distance itself with, nor to rationalize."
71,The Hunt,9,12 August 2013,beautiful piece of work,"the direction and the screenplay of the hunt is very good.the movie keeps its audience involved for every single minute.the pace of the movie and acting just brings perfection. and the best part is the story and the way it is delivered.as the movie progresses, it brings in the feeling it could even happen to me. it makes u put yourself into that situation and decide what would you do. down the line it makes u forget that you are watching a movie. indeed it feels like watching live a real life situation. brilliant piece of acting by both the lead actors.definitely not recommended for children as it could bring in negative psychological resultshighly recommended to watch for grown-ups"
72,The Hunt,10,28 July 2013,Why we Hate Ourselves,"I will start my review with the perfunctory comment that this is a nearly perfect film. Also, I will add that, in the Los Angeles area in the 1980's, a case not dissimilar to this took place. The McMartin preschool case victimized a school teacher who was falsely accused and the adults investigating the case had dubious methods of attempting to back up their accusations. Now to the aspect of this story that most interests me: All of the characters in this film are suffering from a degree of self loathing that either comes as a result of the accusations or are the initial reasons for the accusations taking place. To elucidate, I would have to turn this review into a spoiler so I won't cite specific reasons for my conclusion. If I am correct, however, this is one of the only films I've ever seen that so vividly shows the internal holocaust that takes place when love is taken from us, how we turn our anger towards ourselves. What was particularly amazing to me is that the protagonist managed to maintain his self respect as long as he did. Ultimately, though, The Hunt concludes that self hatred (and nearly mystical paranoia) is unavoidable when our sources of support have been stripped from us."
73,The Hunt,10,5 July 2013,A film that will never leave you!,"I'll start by saying I'm a big fan of Mads Mikkelsen. He's done a lot of good work, but after watching his film, Valhalla Rising, he's become one of my favorite actors. His performance in in this film - THE HUNT - did not disappoint me. Quite the contrary; it has confirmed that Mikkelsen is a heavyweight whose consistent performances are second to none. I won't go into any detail about specific scenes because this film is such a joy to watch (despite the agony that it elicits) that it is best seen without any real knowledge of the subject matter.What I can say is that all aspects of the film - the script, the acting, the direction and the cinematography - are exemplary. If you are tired of the studio crap being put out in LA then this independent film must be on your list. It is up there with the likes of Tyrannosaur and Sling Blade. For me it is perfect cinema. 10/10!"
74,The Hunt,10,7 June 2013,Why men are reluctant to work with small children,"In a small Danish town, a recently divorced teacher is struggling to get his life together again. Having lost his teaching job, he works at the local kindergarten, where he is very popular with the kids. However, a slight misunderstanding leads to a horrible chain of events.Just like in his most famous film Festen, Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg returns to the topic of child molestation. However, unlike Festen, this movie deals with the horrible consequences for a decent man being accused of child abuse.The film is hard and cold, never shying away from showing the horrendous journey that lies ahead for the blameless main character Lucas. The film deals with the power of an innocent lie, and how easily people consider a lie, especially coming from a small child, as a fact.Mads Mikkelsen carries the film on his own, more or less. He is in almost every scene, and his acting performance is nothing short of brilliant. He portrays Lucas with such warmth and sympathy, and it is really heartbreaking to see how he is treated by the local community, even his old hunting buddies who are supposed to be his friends, once the lie is out in the open. I know the film is labeled as a psychological drama, but in my opinion it is also nothing short of a tremendously well made psychological horror movie. One of the best films I've seen so far this year."
75,The Hunt,10,4 June 2013,Terrifyingly effective!,"Without wasting anytime whatsoever, Thomas Vinterberg places us in the middle of a small Danish village with his new film, THE HUNT. We immediately are drawn in and can't help but feel a love for this community made up of heart-warming and loving close friends. This love will soon be tested however.Mads Mikkelsen play Lucas, a teacher who is currently employed as an assistant at the local preschool. Lucas is a gentle, caring and somewhat lonely man who has hope that his teenage son will come and live with him. We are introduced to Klara, the clever and somewhat troubled 7 year old daughter of his neighbours and best friends. We see that Klara not only looks up to Lucas but has grown a great appreciation for the kind man who, unlike her parents, has the time to give her the attention she is in need of. When not surrounded by children or arguing with his ex-wife on the phone, Lucas finds love in his dog and enjoys hunting with the other men in the community. This will all be brought to an end when a lie is told. A lie that will spread like wild-fire, burning Lucas' life and future away forever.Terrifyingly effective, this gut-wrenching dramatic thriller will put you in the place of it's protagonist as he is unexpectedly thrust into one of the most realistic horrifying situations a man can ever find himself in. Emotionally dreadful, the story is filled with pain and the film is powerful enough to evoke all sorts of emotions, leaving you with a sense of helplessness. The Hunt is not for the faint of heart!"
76,The Hunt,,8 May 2013,Riveting introspection,"The story idea behind the film is so powerful and simple I am surprised it hasn't been tapped before in a film; a kindergarden teacher has no way to prove he was not inappropriate with one of the children at his care. It's gripping in the most basic, visceral sense. It sure had me glued.Ethically we can interpret for days. The overall idea is that sin inexplicably manifests in the world, a very Protestant thing but beats similar works by both Trier and Haneke in the emerging tapestry.The only prerequisite for any of it to work is plausibility. Oh Mikkelsen and everyone else is superb in conveying the turmoil of soul, but you have to buy that it could happen to you and you would be helpless in just this way. I admit the supermarket scene seems far- fetched, but the rest is generally fine by me, doesn't pull me out.A few talking points. Law and 'experts' are largely absent, this may strike some people as unrealistic but I think it rings truer to a primal experience of life where, good or bad, you simple have to work out problems inside the community without appeal to authority. It matters that the law eventually decides but that does not of itself make things right in the minds of people.The film goes the easy way, trusting to the viewer the overall truth that is kept from the characters. We know from the first that the claims are unfounded which creates all the gut-wrenching tension of an innocent man being persecuted, in Hitchcockian terms this would be us knowing about the bomb under the counter.But if you shift around inside the film, you will find progressively more valuable viewpoints to contemplate. From the perspective of the man, as said, we have a simple existential intensity and revulsion at injustice, simple as in to understand. From the perspective of the community, the more complicated nature of the experience is that we can't know the truth, have to go on faith and emotion. And this has to be masked with reason, to be respectable, which means all those psychological tools about repression and suggestion, which do exactly what they try to bring to light and explain.Superficially all this is with guilt in mind, but if you really look it's about the nature of truth and reality. What we see is the profound inadequacy of logic to explain, logic being a relatively recent tool that is still being perfected. At root, a story has been circulated and from that 'truth' is inferred and agreed as the most logical. So 'sin' manifests because something is believed to have gone wrong. At the deepest level, we have a powerful insight on the original causality. The filmmaker either knows a great deal or simply happened on it, either way it matters that we truly know the following; there was genuine feeling in the girl for the man, the girl was shown an image that was wrong for her. At root is feeling and image, not story. And a third thing, self. We are all self-centered beings, but kids are hopelessly so. Now there is no logical reason why the girl has swapped in her mind the man showing his penis with her beloved teacher, other than she loves him, and has swapped this being an illusory image for the real thing, but that is what has happened, and we go on to see in the film how this can create a story with the power to alter reality. From the perspective of the girl which is the most inscrutable, we have a single subjective shot in the film; when in her bedroom she mistakes her father for Lucas, a sort of hazy seeing that possibly links everything.This is great stuff. It all points to a powerful inextricability of feeling from image from self both shaping and being shaped by them, all three being illusory by the exact same degree.It all ends with another image that is feeling taking shape in the woods, which is the karmic chain in the utmost sense."
77,The Hunt,7,16 November 2013,"Very good, but doesn't fulfil its concept to the fullest.","I really wanted to see this film back in February around Oscar time, but naturally when 2012 truly wraps up my interest does too, so this viewing is a long time coming. And inevitably it is a bit of a disappointment but it certainly has its merits. Perhaps it's more fitting to watch it now with the recent story about the man in the UK who was burnt to death for the accusation of being a paedophile. It's a terrifying and utterly impossible stigma when it's false. And the first hour of The Hunt is built on the impending doom of that setup. The first few sequences keep you tense as you see Lucas innocently interact with kids. This half is really well-written and utilises its slow burn pace with precision. Utterly tragic how the best and worst things possible happen to Lucas simultaneously. Mads Mikkelson gives a fantastic sympathetic performance without overdoing it.Unfortunately the narrative seems to leave him for the second half and the film isn't quite sure what to do. We are deliberately left with the question of did Lucas actually do it or not, but then it quickly abandons that compelling tension for certainty that he didn't. Instead, it begins with melodrama with Lucas' son and then features two big forced outburst scenes. I just didn't believe Lucas was at that irrational point in those situations and it lost me. That said, I don't think the film quite went far enough in its concept given what can really happen in these scenarios, especially after the last 10 minutes where it decides to go happy but illogical. But then, perhaps that's up for debate. It's a shame that it couldn't quite nail the tone in the second half but The Hunt is still a really good film with great photography for the most part, though I'm curious why Thomas ""Dogme"" Vinterberg used unnecessary special effects at times.7/10"
78,The Hunt,2,10 September 2013,tedious and then the ending is terrible,"This poor guy is mistakenly singled out in his small community as a child molester. NOT EVEN CLOSE.He is denied sustenance at the only grocery store in his small town. Then, he's beaten up, and his faithful Cocker Spaniel is killed and dumped in his dooryard, after some £$^% throws a brick through his window.I kept waiting and watching for it to live up to the rating (1st recommendation on IMDb). This is tedious, and the ending DOES NOT justify all the crap. I think this is the lowest I have ever rated a movie, EVER.Don't waste your time with this one, but I am still shaking my head over the high rating, and if someone much more enlightened than me wants to correct my thinking on this it is welcome."
79,The Hunt,6,29 March 2013,Good performance but .....,"This movie is very thought-provoking, and contains some great acting. It really shows how a small lie can destroy someone's live. However, it fails terribly in exploring many options available to disprove this lie! (doctors, child psychologist, good police work,...). Also, the ending is hard to conceive in real life. How can the whole town forgive him ( and how can he forgive them) after only a year and they meet and celebrate as nothing had happened? Yes it tries to give an answer at the very end but simply not strong enough....unless Lucas is a complete idiot for believing that everything would be like before. ""Can we please see a movie where common sense prevails?"""
80,The Hunt,9,5 May 2015,Paranorium Euphorium (****1/2),"Community is an interesting word, isn't it? I've always been led to believe that the term embodies a group of people working together towards the same goals- fellowship and support in good times and bad. No matter what country or region, it's a universal idea. Thomas Vinterberg's ""The Hunt"" is a maddening, frustratingly brilliant portrayal of a good man embattled by a broken community, either too lazy or too proud to self-reflect. It's less of a commentary on pedophilia or child abuse and more a visceral commentary on what today's idea of a community actually is, and the powerful way it can simultaneously build up or destroy an individual or group.Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is an average, lonely guy. Recently divorced with a teenage son and a newer job, he's made progress trying to piece his life back together. Interestingly, he's the only male teacher in a preschool-kindergarten, but as the movie tells us, it appears that was his only choice after his other school closed. The children appear to adore him, and why not? He's kind, helpful, and approachable. So approachable, in fact, that children come to him for solace, comfort, and even assistance using the restroom.One particular child, his best friend's daughter Klara (Wedderkopp), looks to Lucas to fill a role that her own parents haven't been filling (which makes sense considering how much they fight). Klara just craves positive attention, and who could blame her? After all, it appears all she's learning at home is animosity from her parents, and she's even forced to view adult material by her brother and his friend at one point. What child wouldn't gravitate towards another adult male that isn't the embodiment of things she doesn't yet understand? Unfortunately, the comfort that Klara finds in Lucas gets twisted in her mind with the need to 'imitate' adults, as she has been taught. In a perfect storm of events, the headmaster of the school is made to believe (via Klara) that Lucas has molested her.As I mentioned earlier, this isn't a film about molestation- instead it's about communities, society, and the power of conjecture. From the moment that the headmaster suspects an issue, Lucas' world falls apart. Word spreads rapidly about his alleged wrongdoing, and because the audience is made to be aware of his innocence, our outrage begins. This man endures alienation from friends, isolation from his son, a suspension from his job, an arrest, a savage beating from grocery store employees who ban him from shopping there, and violations to his property- even his pet.This small community, so quick to rally around the young girl and her family, throws their entire weight behind destroying this man. Even his best friend, the father of the girl, can't rely on their friendship bond to decide whether or not he's at fault. Why bother waiting for evidence, a trial, or common logic, right? I got a sense that this community is so ugly on the 'inside' that they couldn't wait to take it out on someone else- Lucas was simply an easy target. He's a divorcée, lives by himself, is a male in a traditionally female job- he's ripe for the picking. As a society, we're familiar with this situation, for if you exhibit any quirks or deviate from the norm, it's suspicious, and by proxy guilty to some.This film stirred such an anger in me, but not simply because child abuse was a subject. I was more infuriated by the amount of ignorance displayed by a group of people who went out of their way to destroy a person's reputation and livelihood. Even when young Klara admits her mistake, people go out of their way to ignore what she's really saying. It sure must have taken a lot of self-hatred and lack of understanding to push even further against Lucas.This community puts on a show with a sense of closeness, but we know better. Earlier in the film, we see these adults argue, get drunk, ignore their children, and it's fine- but when a crisis happens, they're a unified bunch, ready to take out their inadequacies on another. I'm obviously aware that an actual crime like the alleged one in this film should incite anger in a community. What's so galling, that this film reflects in such a concise manner, is the inability of people to look within themselves, and how damaging it can be to others. There's a reason why we have law enforcement and courts in our world, for it's a slippery slope when accusations fly. We're understandably so protective of children that our mind's defense mechanisms open up during a crisis, disregarding reason and intuition. ""The Hunt"", showing the ugly side of smaller communities, will stick with me for some time. I watched a community shun the beliefs that it was likely founded upon. The film's most powerful moment, as a battered Lucas tries to pull himself together for a Christmas Eve service, is simply poetic. A knowing look from Lucas to his best friend encapsulates the utter betray he must have felt. It's a moment that I imagine many innocent community outsiders have felt over time, for it's clear our world is no stranger to snap judgments. ""The Hunt"" is an important film to consider, and deserves mention as one of the best of the year."
81,The Hunt,8,22 December 2014,Incredible,"A teacher (Mads Mikkelsen) lives a lonely life, all the while struggling over his son's custody. His life slowly gets better as he finds love and receives good news from his son, but his new luck is about to be brutally shattered by an innocent little lie.The critical consensus states, ""Anchored by Mads Mikkelsen's sympathetic performance, 'The Hunt' asks difficult questions with the courage to pursue answers head on."" Very much the case. Mikkelsen has quickly risen to international star status, and this film shows why... such a difficult role to take.And what is scary is how this can really happen. The idea of pedophilia is scary, but the idea of being falsely accused is almost as bad... no doubt what happens here is no exaggeration."
82,The Hunt,8,9 June 2014,Mads makes this better,"Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a much liked person in the community. He is getting divorced while having limited time with teenage son Marcus. He's working at the kindergarten after his school closed down. Little Klara is the daughter of his best friend Theo and she really likes him. She tries to give him a present which Lucas tries to gently turn back. She tells a fib to head teacher Grethe that explodes out of control.We've seen this movie before. In fact, the movie is laid out openly after we see Lucas and Klara together. The story is set and it's a matter of waiting for it to unfold. Mads is one of the most compelling actors to come out of Denmark. He makes every one of his movies better. He makes this movie better. The other unusual thing about this movie is that it has a compelling young actress in the lead. Young Annika Wedderkopp is fascinating. I doubt she has any idea of what's going on in the movie. That's the sense that is so important in the movie. The only problem is with the ending or last 10 minutes. I don't think that many of those people would show up even a full year later. It seems wrong and too abrupt. Also I saw the alternate ending. I never advocate for killing the lead at the end because that seems to be an easy move. This movie deserves that move more than any other."
83,The Hunt,10,6 April 2014,A twenty-first century masterpiece,"Jagten - The Hunt is a film that stays with you, forces you to rethink your philosophy on life. The autumn wind guides a hunter's bullet into a grazing doe and we walk into a town where every Jack knows every Joe. Lucas is a divorced forty-something easing into his recent appointment as a kindergarten teacher. A strained relationship with his ex-wife deprives him of his son's company for most of the year and he broods over his loneliness in his big house. His best friend's daughter happens to be in his class. Her parents quarrel often and her teenage brother exposes her to pornography early. Lucas' warmth and friendliness wins her over and he becomes her first crush. She writes him a letter and leaves it in his coat with a toy heart. When she kisses a downed Lucas suddenly on the lips, he rebuffs her inappropriate behaviour - something that sets the stage for the major part of the film. Not taking the supposed rejection too well, she tells the school instructor(principal??) that she hates Lucas. When the (incredibly incompetent) woman wants to know more she tells her that Lucas has a stiff... (just watch the film) ... the old hag immediately jumps to the conclusion that Lucas has sexually abused her and more or less coerces the girl into telling everyone else so (even though she denies it at first). The child repeats it in the playground and in a case of mass hysteria, the other children begin claiming to have been abused as well. Lucas is fired from his job, ostracized from society, physically assaulted and has worse done on him. He variously loses (or rather, drives away) his girlfriend, his faithful companion and most of his friends. The only person who stands by him is his friend Bruun, also his son's godfather. But through it all, he holds on to his sense of self, finding comfort in the awareness of his own innocence. Eventually, contradictory testimonies exonerate him but it can not undo any of the damage inflicted on him. The emotions evoked in this act of The Hunt are probably the most realistic, most human ones ever put to film. It's just THAT damn good. He even has a Heisenberg moment in the local mall. The film closes one year later with almost the same scene it begins with. Lucas has been rehabilitated into society...or so it seems. He is last seen scoping out a doe like in the film's prologue...until a stray shot from the blue grazes his ear - a realization that things will never be the same again. Based on the true story of a child psychiatrist similarly accused in the late 90's. All in all, one of the greatest art films ever and a MUST- WATCH. The sharp contrast between European social mores and others is evident in this film."
84,The Hunt,10,12 March 2014,Depressingly enlightening.,"This movie stimulates feelings of anger, sadness, and sympathy. It is unfairly true that men are more susceptible to molestation accusations than women are. This holds true no matter how credible or honorable a man was perceived in the past. Many criticize the lead character's approach to the accusations, but when a man is socially deemed a pervert, he is guilty even when proved innocent. Certain reputations fade but never disappear. This movie, while upsetting, sheds light on the double standards that men must carefully avoid throughout their lives. In order to prevent bad things from happening to good people, all societies have a duty to inhibit injustices such as this."
85,The Hunt,10,27 February 2014,"Heart-wrenching, excruciating, makes you want to scream...","Brilliant film, with great cast and amazing script. One of those films that make you furious for the injustice they portray. One of those films that show the other, the not often told, side of situations like these and shows how someone's life can be destroyed within the blink of an eye and how easy it is for a child to be victimised and emotionally abused, even if nothing has really happened to it.It does not intend at any way to diminish the pain and suffering of really abused children, it just wants to show how equally destroying a false accusation could be both for the child that gets imposed on the brain-washing tactic that it was abused and for the person accused as the abuser. The creators and Mikkelsen said that they read various real transcripts of interviews with children (that it was proved later that they were not abused) and they were absolutely horrified by the way the interviews were carried out and how many children ended up saying what the investigators wanted them to say rather what really happened.Brilliant acting by Mads Mikkelsen. He deserved at least an Oscar nomination (for me the award too) just for the church scene alone (I won't say more), not to spoil it."
86,The Hunt,8,23 February 2014,Witch-hunt in modern times,"How someone's words can awaken a doubt and how it can rapidly turn into verdict without being based on fact examines this excellent study on witch-hunt in modern times. Very skillful gradation of suspense and accent on realism depicts in a plastic manner the painfulness of rejection and persecution by members of social environment, the situation which could happen to every individual. Due to its enigmatic end this Danish drama deserves the epithet of one of better works that deal with persecution and fears of ''civilized'' man.With Jagten, once again, the Danish film industry is emerging as a very interesting and successful one."
87,The Hunt,7,31 January 2014,"Great acting, immaculate production, not an unpredictable bone in its body","There's a lot to admire about The Hunt, foremost of which is probably Mads Mikkelson's performance as the protagonist Lucas. The cast is all-around strong, enlivening characters who don't necessarily have all that many hidden depths from the script itself, and the direction is always at least competent and at best very good. But despite that I just can't love this movie somehow. I've rated it a 7 because it would sort of seem insulting to the actors otherwise, but it really hovers around a 6.5 in my mind. Maybe I'm bringing some baggage to the movie myself since I'm already familiar with historic child molestation social panics, such as the rash of satanic ritual abuse accusations in the 1980s, and I have a rough idea of how something like this might get started. I certainly think this is an important topic to make a film about, and it does throw some interesting light on the way adult relationships are affected by children in various ways (specifically in small Danish rural communities, I suppose, but I'd say the themes are pretty universal).But once The Hunt got going, there was almost nothing in it which took me remotely by surprise. After the main action begins, assuming you have read a one-sentence synopsis of the film, you can pretty much always guess what will happen at any time by asking yourself ""what is the worst decision Lucas could make right now which is nonetheless fairly reasonable from his point of view?"" More generally, you might ask ""what plausible outcome from this scene would be the worst for Lucas's case or position?"" Just like water flowing downhill, you can pretty much foretell where the entire film is going to go from the beginning right out until way in the end of the fourth act.Now, I don't need every movie I like to be some kind of sui generis bolt from the blue that makes me see cinema in a whole new light. But I do like the occasional curveball every now and then. The Hunt, for all of its good qualities, just seemed pre-ordained to run along tracks I could already see. It's worth watching if you're a fan of Mikkelson's or haven't thought about the issues involved very closely, but otherwise there's probably a much more interesting movie about this out there somewhere."
88,The Hunt,8,30 January 2014,Once Again:  The Children's Hour,"Having worked as a teacher for some forty years, I knew deep down inside that a vindictive lie from one student (out of thousands that I had) could take me down in a minute. People are so protective of their children (as they should be) that sometimes they fail to see that they are children with an underdeveloped moral code and a tendency toward impulsiveness and peer pressure. They are sometimes motivated by their own interests and by temper. Unfortunately, parents tend to give them credence when they tell outlandish things. I even felt that tug with my own children, but learned to investigate the story before reacting. Often a simple comment meant a teacher ""hated"" them, or some series events was made to seem much more than it was. Of course, I believe we must be very careful to keep our children's trust and support them when necessary. The people in this movie don't do this and send a man to hell and back. A dear friend of mine spent six months in jail, accused by his daughter of molestation. She finally admitted that she got made because he wouldn't allow her to go out on a school night with her boyfriend. This movie is gut wrenching and real and it happens all the time. Maybe we need to learn patience and to that end, it works very well."
89,The Hunt,10,13 January 2014,Horror of 'the social',"I think there's no way this movie can leave any viewer untouched. I regard it as a kind of horror movie. Not traditional kind of horror but a horror of 'the social' or sociological horror. It really disturbs and frustrates the viewer to live through the events of main character. But in the end it's all worth the unease and leaves you slightly optimistic. The movie deals with the theme of social hysteria. In western societies child abuse is one of those phenomena that has attracted hysteria. I regard The Hunt as a very important movie which shows where this kind social hysteria can lead us. I hope no one should ever go through these kind of experiences.Mikkelssen deserves every good word for his acting and Vinterberg can be viewed as the most interesting danish director, passing Von Trier."
90,The Hunt,9,26 December 2013,Would it be too much to ask that all school administrators see this?,"Long ago I used to substitute teach. I was called in to sub at an elementary school though I usually did high school. I thought once couldn't hurt but found myself feeling scared to death when kids would spontaneously come up to hug me, a guy, alone in a room with them. Such is the legacy of a long history of school situated child molestation cases.This brilliant movie brought it all back and so much more. It's the harrowing tale of a well-liked fellow townsman, falsely accused, all because of an innocent chain of not-so-improbable events. The acting is spot on, Mads Mikkelsen is especially convincing, but its overall impact is that this was made by an ensemble that wholeheartedly believed in this project. That's quite impressive as its trying to argue for a more cautious approach to such accusations, a not-so-popular proposition with many parents.This is not lighthearted fair. Best you save the DVD for a night you're prepared to face some uncomfortable viewing. But as movies go this may be the most important event of the year. It's masterful and extremely effective almost without comparison. For the longest time I couldn't look at Mads Mikkelsen without seeing him as the villain in Casino Royale. With this flick, that's no longer a problem.(Personally I'd like to see video cameras in all locations in all schools, but I've no doubt those who really don't want that are the parents, at least in high school.)"
91,The Hunt,9,14 December 2013,One man's struggle against life's unfairness.,"A film about how unjust life is. About evil, the meaning of truth and forgiveness. A film about life itself, encompassed in a single life story, so unlike anything you've ever heard of, that it keeps you breathless and on the verge of tears throughout. It's better than anything I've seen in a long time, thanks to its originality and truthfulness. It's premise is so uncommon, any reaction from the characters seems real, since you never know what someone in that situation would do. In all, it brings out some of the worst problems in life, lead by unfairness and the prevalence of lies. There's a glimpse of hope near the end, when human forgiveness is shown in a flicker, but ultimately distrust prevails. ""The world is full of evil but if we hold on to each other, it goes away."""
92,The Hunt,,9 December 2013,Great movie,"This is one great movie. Come to think of it, I've just realised how well made Danish movies are, and Mads Mickelsen has become one of my favourites. This movie deserves all the nominations and awards from any of the decent award giving bodies there are. It's very telling and whoever is in the profession of child care or even a step dad, a grandpa will start getting cautious of the consequences such situations may lead to. A story of bad fate that has befallen a decent and innocent citizen. Although, a victim of prejudice, the movie has been well acted and made like it can happen in real life, that you will not be vindictive of a scornful society because you may very well be involved in the movie and see it in an objective way giving the full right to the benefit of the doubt for those who never really witnessed anything other than premature judgement and baseless accusations. After watching this movie, one can't help but contemplate about one's surrounding concerns and personal circumstances."
93,The Hunt,9,29 October 2013,"Gripping, Chilling and Haunting; Truly great film","Jagten (The Hunt) - **** Anchored by a superb performance from Mikkelsen, The Hunt is the emotionally taxing story of a man falsely accused. Vinterberg's masterpiece is involving and heart-rending from beginning to end.The film itself plays upon a classic notion; an innocent man who is wrongly convicted (The Shawshank Redemption - need I say more?) However the difference with this film is that it is pure paranoia which convinces the public, rather than logic and the probable truth. Mikkelsen's performance as Lucas is an absolute masterclass; he conveys a man silently breaking inside while trying to hold his own on the outside. The supporting cast were certainly effective, but this really is a one man show and so for that I hold the applause solely for Mikkelsen.The cinematography is also strangely beautiful. For such a dark and deeply emotional film, the intimate imagery of this beautiful Danish town was a complete contrast to the content. It played with me for a while but I did come to the conclusion that it only added to the monumental effectiveness of this film.My favorite aspect of the film would have to be the son, Marcus. He is so well developed by Vinterberg, and his actions are completely believable (and touching) as a devastated, loyal young son. I must give props to the young actor Fogelstrom as well for a fantastic job on that front.The ending of the film is also subtly magnificent, one of the best closing scenes I've seen in a long time. The Hunt is a chilling commentary on social hysteria and paranoia, and is well directed and superbly acted. An absolute must see"
94,The Hunt,7,11 October 2013,A superb film,"""The Hunt"" is about how the life a man, Lucas, is changed forever when a young girl of nine, Clara, accuses him of molesting her. A little lie, told out of a childish jealousy, spreads in the whole small town, turning Marcus's friends and neighbors into his enemies.While Marcus's life become more and more of a nightmare, Clara, ironically, becomes the center of the attention of her parents, who often quarreled with each and ignored her.One of the film's main themes is how much man is free in determining his own fate. In the case of Marcus, he seems to be utterly without a choice about his fate. A respectable man with a good reputation become the villain in a matter of days, all because of the childish lie told by Clara. Even when we think he has recovered from the evils that have happened to him, we find out we are wrong. No matter how he tries, he is haunted for the rest of his life.I think ""The Hunt"" has a high chance of winning the Academy Award this year."
95,The Hunt,9,6 October 2013,Persecuted teacher exposes community's savagery,"Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt (2012) ranges far beyond the central plot of a kindergarten teacher's life being ruined by a little girl's false charge of molestation. Still, that provides the central emotional force.The film's more cerebral address is the ostensibly civilized society's essentially tribal, predatory nature. Vinterberg examined normal familial savagery in The Celebration (1998) and tribal roots among small-town American adolescents in Dear Wendy (2005). In a small Danish town Vinterberg now examines how fragile the essential community can be when a predatory righteousness bestirs itself. When this hero is persecuted by his community his only support comes from his family.The first scene -- a rowdy circle of male friends plunging into a freezing pond -- sets the tone of mindless macho camaraderie and bravado. That leads into perhaps the central metaphor -- the compulsion to hunt the innocent. The film is framed by two deer hunts. In the first the hero Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) in his family's tradition bags a deer. In the second his son Marcus (Lasse Fogelstrom) is out to kill his first. Both hunts are defined as rites initiating one into manhood. The hunt scenes cast a particular shade on the community's turning against its popular kindergarten teacher. This is civilization ""red in tooth and claw"" (Tennyson not Vinterberg). The deer didn't hurt nobody.The woman in authority is as brutish as the town's men. Kindergarten director Grethe (Susse Wold) has her innocent charges' interests in mind when she hears little Klara's (marvelous Annika Wedderkopp) say Lucas exposed his erection to her. But Grethe's compulsive persecution of Lucas turns her campaign from defense of the innocent into an attack on an innocent. Ultra vares, she interferes in Lucas's custody battle with his ex-wife over his son Marcus. Grethe gives Lucas no chance to defend himself. In their predatory zeal Grethe and Klara's mother ignore Klara's attempts to recant her lie. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com."
96,The Hunt,10,30 September 2013,Riveting and daunting.,"My first reaction after watching ""The Hunt"" was of affinity. Because that's precisely what director Thomas Vinterberg is looking for as he works up a deftly-crafted drama that's both unnerving and significant. I also knew at once that ""The Hunt"" would be one affirmed adversary for the Academy Award for Best-Foreign Language Film. I haven't followed the works of Vinterberg closely so I had zilch idea of what to expect. Contrary to my doubts, the initial viewing of ""The Hunt"" knocked the wind out of me. The movie starts out as a limping drama and Vinterberg spends a large part of the first hour building his story and characters and giving them enough time to turn into someone we know. How well he succeeds is something you find out in the second half. A jolting drama that works as a rattling thriller, ""The Hunt"" spares no one as it follows the crumbling life of Lucas, a divorced ex-teacher, as he is wrongly accused by a small girl of sexual abuse.Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is known to be a quiet person among his friends who wouldn't do anything that'd be classified as illicit. He has a teenage son, Marcus, but his ex-wife disapproves of them meeting up. Lucas works in a kindergarten where toddlers enjoy his presence. Nadja (Alexandra Rapaport), a co-worker, confesses her attraction towards him. Even his ex-wife agrees to let Marcus stay with him for a while. For someone plagued with tragedy for a long time, things start to look up.Lucas occasionally walks his best friend Theo's (Thomas Bo Larsen) daughter, Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), to the kindergarten. A warm friendship develops between the two when Klara takes a liking to Lucas' dog Fanny. One day, Klara's brother shows her a smutty image of a naked woman as a joke, a joke which mentally traumatizes her. Later that day, Lucas shrugs her off, which hurts her. He mental trauma impels her to accuse him of having sexually abused her, a thing which the nursery staff isn't willing to pass. Lucas is ostracized and fired instantly. He is cold-shouldered wherever he goes and by everyone who passes him because everyone believes him to be a sexual predator. Slowly, gradually, his son also meets the same fate. Though some people believe his version of the story, the growing resentment forces him to lash out violently to those who hassle him. Though he builds up a strong defense in front of the jury, Lucas realizes soon enough that he may never be exonerated completely, at least not by the community. One of the things that I was impressed with was that Vinterberg never tries to assuage the wild emotions that the plot is rigged with. And he prefers to let the story revel at his own pace, allowing us to be sucked into the life of its protagonist and see things from his perspective. Although we know who is responsible for the iniquitous deed, Vinterberg makes sure that his movie isn't about the questions and the answers. He simply wants you to observe, to empathize. And the characters he creates are beneficial to that vision. They are someone we know and not someone theatrical. What they say isn't theatrical either. It's just a bunch of people looking for answers, the right ones and the script compliments that mood. It's a tightly-wounded piece of writing that doesn't hesitate to take shots, pull cuffs and ask questions. A lot of questions about morality are raised and are even answered to some extent. The remaining unanswered ones are left for us to mull over.Mikkelsen hands in a towering performance that's at the epicenter of the film. He's wonderfully expressive, easy to sympathize with and efficacious. His breakdown at the Church Mass is a fine piece of acting that's both moving and provoking. He's also guilty of stealing the spotlight from the rest of the cast, who are stellar in each of their respective roles. ""The Hunt"" is a riveting piece of cinema, a terrifically tense drama that bravely asks involuted questions. It's also fantastically engaging, occasionally indulgent, intuitively written, carefully canned and acted to sleek perfection. It's hard to watch, it might even be appalling to some but that's no reason to rebuff it. It's the kind of cinema that you rarely get to see."
97,The Hunt,10,26 September 2013,Brilliant Film,This was the most thought-provoking film I have seen in a very very long time. Mads Mikkelsen's portrayal of an unjustly accused man is brilliant. You become completely engrossed in the man's struggle and your heart breaks scene after scene for the dilemma he is in. Mikkelsen is able to capture the loyalty of the audience and bring you on this hideous journey even when the topic leaves you squirming in your seat. You feel how uncomfortable he is from the very beginning and evolve with the character as he discovers that those closest to him are able to turn their backs on an instant. The supporting cast is equally as talented. You feel engulfed in this community's problems and can envision how such a misunderstanding can occur.This movie had us talking for hours about the dilemma of accusation and truth. A genius film that will leave you thinking.
98,The Hunt,10,17 September 2013,Reality itself,"This is something that actually happens anywhere. In my country there is a well known accusation to an assistant in a kinder garden for sexual abuse. It's kind of the same story only it's not settled yet. This is what happens when an accusation like that it's made, even though it's true or not, the suspect always loses, doubt it's never out of the frame. This film show us, how this world it's full of hate and fear. A masterpiece i must say, i almost could feel like i was there, i felt like Marcus, believing without doubts. The truth is, this things is one of the things that people never forgets. The ugly truth was put on tape. A big applause to everyone who made this possible.Everybody must see this film."
99,The Hunt,9,11 September 2013,Little lie can really change the life,"I saw the movie yesterday at home and really enjoy it.At the beginning of the film It seems we encounter a lonely teacher with his family problems but as we go farther we understand that the story is more complicated than that. the movie show us how can a little lie even from a child destroy a life of an innocent man.This lie made such an effect on his life that his best friends and coworkers left him alone ,he can't buy things from store not him neither his son!! , his new girlfriend has a doubt that he did it or not and...... The acting were great specially Mads Mikkelse (Lucas) with his innocent look and I feel sympathy with him. other parts of movie were awesome and i can't say something wrong about film. The great ending made the film better because even the father of the child forgive!! him but at the end we saw that somebody else still (after one year!!) wants him to be hunt and killed!!"
100,The Hunt,8,3 September 2013,Mob Rules,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's the worst nightmare for every Parent, Teacher and Child. Sexual Abuse of a child is incomprehensible ... it's unthinkable, yet all too common. So what happens when a man is falsely accused of such inappropriate action? Well if the accusation comes from the most innocent of faces - a 5 year old girl - the falsely accused man stand no chance ... regardless of what the letter of the law states.Such is the story of Lucas (Mads Mikkelson, TV's ""Hannibal""), a lonely, small town kindergarten teacher who has gone through a rough divorce and seems to be losing his fight for visitation rights to his teenage son. We witness Lucas quietly going about his life ... he is loved by the students and surrounded by life long hunting buddies and friends. Soon enough, things start to look up for Lucas. An attractive teacher expresses her interest in him and his son convinces the mother that he should live with his dad.The set-up of the characters and the powerfully stoic performance of Mikkelson elevate this somewhat predictable story to the brink of excruciating discomfort for the viewer. In the blink of a childhood moment of imaginative confusion of emotional pain, an innocent man's life is forever altered. Klara (Annika Wedderkopp) is the daughter of Lucas' best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen). A very protective teacher unwittingly leads Klara down the path that leads to a landslide of emotion that simply cannot be stopped. Of course, the teachers and parents and community believe the cute little girl ... the innocence of kids cannot be doubted. As the defensive instincts of parents kick in, we see the dangerous side of influence and suddenly numerous kids have piled on and become part of the story.Director Thomas Vinterberg brilliantly keeps us looking through the eyes of Lucas. We know he is innocent and we beg him to scream it! Instead, he expects everyone to just know he does not have this in him at all. His faith in himself never waivers despite our discomfort and anger. He does finally reach a boiling point after a heart-breaking scene in the local market, but even that moment does not feel like a victory.While The Scarlet Letter gave us an indication of community exile, this story shows us just how quickly human nature has us jumping to conclusions and assuming the worst. Persecution and judgment by the mob is one of the most dangerous developments of society. Lucas reminds us that innocence and faith may not always be enough."
101,The Hunt,9,18 August 2013,great movie,"very surprise movie. good story. nice actor.Innocent feeling . Human indifference. Brutal living trust and friendship,Once the cracks will never be restored as ever. The world is full of wickedness.but if we support each other,it will eventually go away.This is the real social！！The so-called conscience is rally fooling themselves. Living in the world,society let you die .you will eventually want to die."
102,The Hunt,9,13 August 2013,A little lie and a giant truth which will never match,"I have seen a few movies like this theme but I don't remember the names except 'The children's hour' and 'Atonement' but this movie will scare out for an adult man. 'A royal affair' fame Mads Mikkelsen was the lead character whose performance was so good, one of his career best.The story happens between the two hunting seasons, what follows in between period of time is the movie. A much loved middle aged kindergarten teacher who is accused of the crime he's not committed. He has to deal it along with his messy divorced life who is fighting for parenting rights to his son. Because of a small lie suddenly that everything he loves will be against to him and how he overcome or whether he come or not is the rest.It is a toughest theme to blend the two opposite characters in a movie, as one is an innocent, other seems innocent and by both the perspective everything looks innocent. It was a writer's smartness to make the audience not to fall for either of sides emotion. But many movie watchers will pick a side, in those times it will make something uncomfortable to watch. Several intense scenes were so close to stop my breathing for a moment.A must see movie of a man's courage to fight back when his friends, family and sweetheart ditched him in a dark place. A fine Danish movie not to be missed and one of a best of 2012. A must see movie and deserves to be appreciated by world film fanatics."
103,The Hunt,8,17 July 2013,Provocative,"'The Hunt' is about Lucas, a nursery teacher, popular with the children, who is just getting his life sorted out, is excited about a new lover, and is over the moon that his son wants to come and live with him. An unintentional mishandling of a situation and a couple of simple comments, however, set in motion events that tear everything to pieces.To discuss the story beyond that would be wrong, but the tone of the storytelling brings to mind Tim Roth's 'The War Zone'. This is not a popcorn flick; the film makes every effort to keep both feet firmly planted in reality. The result is an effective, gripping, performance-lead drama, with nearly every scene keeping a good measure on how the events would actually play out in real life rather than on the silver screen. The story itself makes for a generally very well observed study of how it is that a rumour can pick up its own momentum with disturbingly little effort and become fact, how people believe what they need to, not what they should, and the sadly damaging effect that has. The situation it portrays provides a very sad underpinning for lessons on why it isn't just children who need to be careful.Everybody in the film gives a great performance, with Mads Mikkelsen shining bright. Last year he showed us why he may be one of the most criminally underrated actors working today, with a phenomenal, moving performance in 'A Royal Affair', and here he inhabits his character so brilliantly that every conversation, ever mannerism, ever reaction feels effortless. Not to spoil the ending, but the final scene features a very still performance from him, which brings to mind Viggo Mortensen's ability to say a lot with very little. Spot on. The film also looks very good, with some stunning photography.The downside, and the only reason 'The Hunt' didn't quite hit my Top Ten of this year, was that certain plot points, despite trying to remain very ""real world"", don't seem to gel. It is a hard thing to put into words, and it may simply be that something was lost in translation; whether the criticism makes sense to you depends, perhaps, on your own feelings about the drama. The transition of time and his efforts in the last section of the film seem, to me, to be a bit forced in order to make the final point with that aforementioned performance; it should perhaps have been written differently. That said, however, what I will call the underbelly of the story, the hinted at but never fully discussed aspect, remains unresolved, and whilst I understand this may be frustrating for some, I found it to be an effective device, hinting at a context and reason for the whole drama in the first place. The lack of resolution increases the unease and means the film closes on a bitter, dark and contemplative note, the prospect haunting you...as it should.An engaging drama, well delivered by the cast and generally well directed, even if not the masterpiece I wanted."
104,The Hunt,10,24 June 2013,A perfect 10!,"I wanted to watch this movie from the very first time I saw the trailer. I had to wait several months, I may say, but it was totally worth it! Jagten is A W E S O M E. It has the exact amount of joy, sadness, rage, impotence and every emotion you can think of. It moves your deep feelings to the top (yes, I cried several times...)Even though you know it's a film, you can't help feeling sorry for Lucas, the main character. He's life becomes a living hell in the blink of an eye, by this ""rumour"" caused by a little (and troubled) girl. Her background (parents and brother) helped this situation develop: lack of needed attention, pornographic images being shown to a young and imaginative mind... It all became a ticking bomb that detonates when Lucas ""rejects"" Klara (I mean, she kisses him and he gently explains that this attitude should only be performed by grown ups).At the end of all, after Klara withdraws her sayings, the whole town feels sorry and like ""try to make it go away"" just by ignoring it... But of course, as the final scene shows, Lucas' life will never be the same again. He'll always be under the microscope... Poor guy, really.I recommend this movie a lot."
105,The Hunt,8,3 June 2013,Compellingly Bleak,"There is often an element of fortuity in the timing of a film's release  sometimes for the better, sometimes not. Only recently, Robert Redford's muddled and ambiguous thriller, The Company You Keep, with its sympathetic portrayal of idealistic 1960s domestic terrorists motivated by their desire for a better world, would not have been helped by going into theatres just after the Boston Bombings. I doubt many Americans, or others, would have been much in the mood to empathise with these ageing bleeding-hearted liberals who thought the way to utopia was by bombing innocent people.I don't imagine it ever crossed the mind of Danish film-maker, Thomas Vinterberg, that his dour drama, The Hunt (Jagten), centring on allegations of paedophilia would come out just as British police were making headlines across the English-speaking world by questioning, arresting and naming a whole swathe of television personalities accused of such heinous offences from around 40 years ago. (If they themselves are not naming them, they are certainly giving enough clues for their identities to enter the public domain.)The Hunt focuses on a rather lonely middle-aged divorcée, Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), a redundant school-teacher who is making ends meet working at a local kindergarten. Things appear to be on the up for him as he begins a relationship with an attractive woman, and his teenage son prepares to move back in with him, in preference to his unseen mother to whom Lucas is sympathetic.This incipient happiness comes to a crashing halt when a young girl at the kindergarten  the daughter of his best friend  falsely accuses Lucas of exposing his erect penis to her. The girl wasn't being malicious; her elder brother had shown her an inappropriate image the day before which she couldn't understand and in her confusion a vague allegation is made. Despite almost immediately trying to recant her story, it is believed. Child care professionals repeat the accepted orthodoxy that children never lie about such things and guilt is assumed. Allegations then snowball. Parents are warned that their children may too have been victim of assault and before long Lucas faces a barrage of accusations from children whose stories are consistent in their recall. There is no proof, however, and the Police drop charges when the stories lose credibility  the children all stated they had been taken to the basement at Lucas's house where the abuse took place. His house has no basement.Despite this, the townsfolk are no longer acting rationally. Lucas is ostracised and the victim of threats and physical abuse himself. His dog is shot. His son and a small group of his hunting friends stay loyal to him but he has been tainted by just about the worst crimes imaginable, mud sticks and most people are not prepared to believe there was no substance to them. The film's sympathy was totally with the innocent accused to such a degree that more than once I wondered if we were being fed a misleading narrative.The film is unremittingly bleak. Set in small-town Denmark, its action takes place in winter against a backdrop of perennially grey skies. Likewise, Mats Mikkelsen's portrayal of the accused is monotonal in its depiction of an ordinary man facing the opprobrium of those he once thought were supportive friends. Even when he displays anger, there seems to be some suppressed control to it. On several occasions, I was crying out for him to grab the lapels of someone and shake some sense into them. Only toward the end does he break out from his introspection to accuse his accusers. I would have liked to have seen more emotion earlier on  his own denials of wrong-doing were sometimes just too low-key.Nonetheless, this was a gripping film, well directed and atmospheric. But don't expect to come out from the cinema saying 'Wasn't that enjoyable!'More importantly though, it is a good reminder of the maxim from the great American broadcaster, Edward R. Murrow: We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law."
106,The Hunt,8,8 May 2013,Cinema driven by empathy!,"Empathy is a powerful emotion. It's one of the primary reasons why Cinema affects us. Because we empathize with the characters. As Roger Ebert once appropriately put, ""The audience is concerned with the lives that are not its own."" Jagten or The Hunt is a film that works because of empathy. The protagonist is an innocent man whose life is torn apart because of an innocent lie. There is injustice, but no one exactly responsible for it. All you can do is hope that matters get well for our protagonist. You're so easily invested in the character that it leaves you feeling angered and gloomy for the events he has to go through. I believe most of the credit has to go to Mads Mikkelsen.There is a scene where he turns back and looks at the camera, almost as if he's staring back at the audience with his soul-piercing eyes. And then a character in the movie speaks out exactly what I had in mind, ""I can tell by looking at him.""It takes a compelling performance to achieve that."
107,The Hunt,10,4 May 2013,A difficult and sensitive subject tackled very very well.,"The Hunt is a film of great emotional impact. Offering an interesting insight in to criminal sexual abuse cases, and shows how carefully these sort of cases have to be treated.Director Thomas Vinterberg's story follows the case of a male kindergarten teacher played by Mads Mikkelsen who has falsely been accused of sexually abusing young children. The director lends an assured hand to this very sensitive subject. I especially liked the direction where we can almost see the inner turmoil and struggle with these accusations by Mikkelsen's character. I thought it gave a realistic interpretation of the scenario. The whole community turning on you, and showed how a quick trip to the supermarket can turn in to a spine tingling, uncomfortable nightmare. The performances in the film for me were unquestionably great, with Mads Mikkelsen's powerhouse performance being simply breath taking with every emotion played to perfection and timed perfectly.If i had one small critic of the film is that i buy the community turning on the lead character but it is his colleagues acceptance of the accusations is what bothered me. As they base it on the fact a child does not lie, and for me, this is a very ignorant stance from them, as the accusations should be taken seriously but not blindly accepted as it was in the film. Leading to the ending which i know many did not like , but i did. It may have lacked subtlety, but it made it's final point loud and clear to the viewer.A powerful movie which tackled it's subject with great respect, and provides a great movie to watch about the subject."
108,The Hunt,10,26 December 2017,"The head is beautiful, the end is beautiful.","I have already loved Mads Mikkelsen. This film is full with moral questions.When I watch Mads Mikkelsen's movie,I forgot that it is a movie.good job.
 When I saw this movie's poster first,I am very impressed.This movie did not fool me."
109,The Hunt,9,19 December 2017,Mads Mikkelson soars with an uncompromising performance in this haunting Danish drama about the loss of innocence,"Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt is a dark, powerful, and remarkably haunting testament of a human's innocence crumbled by a misunderstood lie, and the repercussions that follow when the ones who hold your trust the most immediately turn on you before you know it. Whether Vinterberg is taking inspiration from specific real-life events leads little to be known, but the sad news is the events that transpire within the near-two-hour runtime occur to people all around the world more often than many realize. In today's society, it is not uncommon for the innocent victim to be robbed of justice. So what is the topic here? The topic is sexual assault, a major issue that has run rampant throughout society like the plague while innocence of victims, or, in some cases, the wrongly accused hides in the dark as evil prevails with no obstacles to be set free. Mads Mikkelson takes the lead role in the story of a man who is caught at the business end of everyone's cruel misunderstanding while he watches as his life is sucked into a downward spiral. By the end to the film, it is nearly impossible to keep your heart intact from the sheer emotional destruction that follows. This film tells the story of Lucas (played by Mads Mikkelson), a divorced kindergarten teacher who appears to have his life in shape. The children at school love him like a father, and he is dating a beautiful woman (played by Alexandra Rappaport) who hopes to marry. But things get weird when he discovers that one of the girls in his class has somewhat of a crush on him. Lucas believes it is just part of her weird imagination. However, when the girl unexpectedly makes up a story about him doing some sexual misconduct to her, he becomes a target of hatred and hostility by the community including the girl's father (played by Thomas Bo Larsen), her mother (played by Anne Louis Hassing), and the community as a whole as he struggles to prove he is innocent. Thomas Vinterber and co-writer Tobias Lindholm display the liveliness of their storytelling while the former operates the story with a strictly appropriate pacing and delicacy that paints an honest picture of the ugly side of the human race. The subject matter powering to the story is far from comforting and can be especially displeasing for anyone who has dealt with similar incidents. After all, this film never makes any attempts to sugarcoat the upsetting aftermath that consumes an innocent man's life. But that is only part of what makes it so powerful and, at times, deeply frustrating to the point where you can't help but roar at the corrupt face of human nature. We know Lucas is innocent but the community almost immediately sides with the little girl and believes Lucas is an evil seed. Their response to the innocent little lie only evokes sympathy for Lucas as he is forced to endure mass hysteria of angry citizens while he struggles to prove to them that the girl is lying for the sake of exercising her unchained imagination., even when she later admits she was only telling a story. And his struggle would not be emotionally draining enough without the powerful performance by Mads Mikkelson who nails the role with flying colors. The innocence in his eyes never soars away, and his talent on fueling the role with effectiveness pays more than enough to win our hearts up until the end credits roll. And Charlotte B. Christensen blesses the dark environment, lit with eerie lighting to grip viewers with deep displeasure, with striking cinematography that gracefully captures the tone and despair of the characters. It is genuinely impossible to recall a single shot that felt out of place. The Hunt is a haunting, yet brutally powerful drama full of heart, despair, and deeply gripping emotion. And by no means will people will exit it without being choked with a sense of dread or exhaustion, but that is only what makes it a profoundly memorable experience in more ways than one. Thomas Vinterberg delivers a shocking whiplash of a cinematic work that desperately deserves your attention."
110,The Hunt,8,17 December 2017,To break - not to build.,"This film very well shows the realities of this issue, and this is why I did not like it wildly. Yes, it is very important to protect and test the safety of children, But! ...but why the hell people pour tons of shit on a man without any minimum evidence, just on the basis of a small child? Children at this age invent over a hundred fantasies, but no he is definitely guilty... The most important thing is words, not proofs? And it does not matter that it can cost someone a life?"
111,The Hunt,10,29 November 2017,Hard to watch but worth it,"Wow, this is one gripping and electrifying film, anchored by yet another stellar performance from Mads Mikkelsen. I'd suggest going in knowing nothing about the plot, although I imagine that would be hard, given all the attention this film has received. I don't know if I'll ever be able to watch this film again, as it is extremely harrowing, but I consider it a must-watch and one of the best of the decade."
112,The Hunt,8,28 November 2017,Alternative Christmas viewing,"The Hunt was a critically praised film when it was first released, winning the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars.Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a popular kindergarten teacher in a small Danish town: but his world is shaken to its core when he is accused of being a paedophile and the accusations make him a pariah.The Hunt is a superbly acted film as would be expected due to the subject manner. Mikkelsen who's best known for playing villainous roles in English language movies is much more vulnerable figure, becoming a broken man. He is surrounded by a talented cast with the most impressive was Annika Wedderkopp as Klara, the girl who unwittingly makes the allegations and kicks off this horrible chain of events.The film shows how these rumours are spread and the community can turn against someone. It's a giant game of Chinese whispers as children are asked leading questions and parents are given information about the signs of child abuse which lead an overreaction. Even when Lucas' innocence is proved he still has the stigma against him. It is a situation that is all too real.Whilst The Hunt is primarily an actor's film director Thomas Vinterberg is able to put his visual stamp on the film. There are subtle little look throughout the film and there was a great sequence when Klara is making a Christmas decoration with her brother before running outside for the first snow of the winter.The Hunt is a bleak drama that could easily been a story ripped from the headlines. Certainly a film who fans of indie and Euro dramas."
113,The Hunt,9,14 November 2017,"""He hasn't done anything. I just said something stupid.""","Stories like this are frightening, especially when it turns out that the accused child abuser is innocent and winds up with his life utterly destroyed. This one turns out to be a classic case of someone being guilty until proved innocent, and by then, the damage has already been done. And in today's world, the type of scenario presented in the film treads on a slippery slope. After young Klara makes her thoughtless statement to the teacher Grethe (Susse Wold), one can't find fault in the actions taken by her and other persons in a position of authority.I did have a problem with the gentleman called in by Grethe for the initial questioning of Klara, he presented what sounded like a series of leading questions that presumed Lucas's (Mads Mikkelsen) guilt in the matter at hand. What follows is a damning indictment of someone who up till then had been a model citizen confronting his own personal life situation which wasn't altogether a happy one. One tends to lose sight of the title of this picture while watching. ""The Hunt"" sounds like it might have some application to Lucas's plight, in that he's being pursued or 'hunted' for something he didn't do. However the film ends with an actual deer hunt as the occasion of Lucas's son coming of age and getting his own hunting license and a rifle passed down through the family. That potshot taken at Lucas at the very end was delivered as a reminder that Lucas was not entirely exonerated in the eyes of someone or some faction in the community, and that he would have to keep a constant watch over his shoulder. It's a maddening way to live as the result of an immature indiscretion."
114,The Hunt,9,13 November 2017,Unforgettable,"A phenomenal, unforgettable little film about a kind, loving man (Mads Mikkelsen) who is wrongly accused of pedophilia by one of his students who is in Kindergarten, and how the community goes after him in a mean, violent fashion. Mikklesen, in the performance of the year and the turn of his career, is lights-out in a role that requires a lot from him, namely just convincing the audience that he can pull this character off after playing psychopaths for so many years. He carries the film, and the subject matter is heartbreaking, realistically portrayed, and ultimately very sad. The way the film ends is surprising and fitting given the title of the movie, and Mikkelsen's confused, shaken glare will not leave you quickly. This is a near-masterpiece and one of the finest movies from 2013."
115,The Hunt,10,13 November 2017,Missed Gun Shot,"I really find this film one of my favorite and best film I ever watch. we live in looped life with a complicated creatures called humans. We cant forgive we never forgot we can't realize the reality of the things and we always try to make the things complicated more.. in this film we see in the last scene there is a gun shot after the problem been solved. that mean the main character gonna live his life like a prey "" the prey doesn't know who is the hunter""."
116,The Hunt,7,24 October 2017,"Mild impression, I will not come back to him","Although I see that this film has a relatively high score, it did not leave me impressed. Although the performance of Morgan Mortensen was at an exceptional level, the concept of the story gives me the impression that it is a very naive story. Namely, a girl eagerly accuses her teacher of sexually abusing her. Only on the grounds that the girl said that, the teacher was exposed to the torture of the entire society. It is not my fault that on the basis of unproven ill-treatment, the entire knave of the story is set up so that someone is guilty in advance, although at the end of the film the truth has been clearly seen. Imagine someone says: You stole big money and on that basis you are on the pillar of the shame of the whole society, your life will be destroyed without any evidence. No proof of that. Emotions in the film are abundant, but that's not enough for me to rate this film with a higher score."
117,The Hunt,9,20 October 2017,One of the best,I had this movie for a couple of years now but I never had the time or will to watch it. Now that i finally watched it I am sorry for not watching it earlier. Mads Mikelsens performance as a teacher is really breathtaking and the pain he goes through is heartbreaking. Truly emotional movie with roller-coaster of emotions. I enjoyed every second of it and would recommend it to everyone.P.S. bring a box of tissues
118,The Hunt,9,12 October 2017,Uncomfortly real,"""The Hunt"" tells the story of a kindergarten teacher who is falsely accused by a small girl to have engaged with her sexually. When the whole town begins to believe her lie, life for the innocent man begins to become increasingly harder up to a point where he is barely able to live anymore.This movie is able to evoke a lot of emotions from anger and sadness up to desperation. The really bad point is though that it remains within realistic borders all the time, you can really see something like this happening. To see an innocent man who can do nothing at all because all of his credibility has been wiped out in just a single moment leaves you puzzled and unhappy, more so because you can understand why people react the way they do, at least to a certain amount. For me personally, the end was a bit too much and kind of exaggerated what happened before but nevertheless from an emotional point of view, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while.All in all more people should give this film a try to reflect on how far we judge people and burden them with guilt that in some cases they might not deserve. Not an easy watch but one that lasts."
119,The Hunt,8,8 October 2017,you learn something important,"The Hunt is a movie that definitely hunts you almost from the beginning till the last scene.The movie is well organized, directing is excellent and the story is magnificent. The story will give you ultimate sense of anxiety and sadness with a little hope for the truth. you will live in a story of being under the heavy pressure of slandering and fear while you are facing it empty handed. You can see how a little lie can horribly grow up to ruin someone's life and how the people can escalate it deliberately or not. you will perfectly observe the process of happening of that ugly and scary event and to be honest, it may bother you a lot.However, It is extremely informative and useful to watch it. It teaches very important lessons to parents and the society of how to take care of children, to pay attention to their needs, keep them away from dangerous situations and to understand their reactions. This movie shows the value of prevention especially in case of child abuse. Children are vulnerable and can be very easily the victims of sexual harassment. However they can be pretty good little liars and a little lie can cost irretrievable damages to someone's life. So, maybe the best way is to prevent both the possibilities of hiding a lie and the happening of a tragedy. The best is to keep children close, never to be alone in any place with others anywhere without proper monitoring systems even in places like schools.I have to say congrats to the cast and the crew of this movie for bringing us this anxious, scary but useful and informative experience."
120,The Hunt,9,16 August 2017,A Thriller Movie,"The genre of drama does not justify the suspense this movie brings. It is more of a drama thriller. This movie makes you question everything you know about truth. This is one of the best movies that showcases the harsh reality of false accusations and their consequences on the lives of everybody involved. The innocent mistake of a young girl named Klara changes the life of a man, his family and also the lives of the viewers. This movie makes you think about how words impact people and the legal system. And this movie makes you think about it even after weeks of watching it.Mads Mikkelsen's acting is brilliant as always. When he breaks down, the viewers break down as well. The helplessness on his face during the worst times yet the courage to carry on - Mads Mikkelsen deserves several awards for this portrayal. Young Klara's acting deserves a special mention since the audience is convinced with her little lie as well.Story - 8/10 Mads Mikkelsen - 10/10 Actors - 9/10 Direction - 10/10 The concept of injustice is shown in a very sensitive manner in this movie. It is a must watch for every movie lover."
121,The Hunt,10,31 July 2017,One of The Scariest Movies You Will Ever See,"This movie is absolutely brilliant. acting is amazing, soundtrack is superb, cinematography is breathtaking, direction is absolutely amazing. I can't stop praising this film.Movie is about a kindergarten teacher that is wrongly accused of sexually abusing a child. First of all this movie is incredibly disturbing and scar also film touches on some serious topics.If you want to see an incredible movie that will leave you felling scared this is a movie for you."
122,The Hunt,9,16 July 2017,A punch on today's society's PC-correct vigilante attitude,"As much as I love the old-and-tried Hollywood production standards, it's when I witness the rest of the world's boldness and down-to-earth approach to filming usually avoided subjects, that I am reminded why most successful 'foreign' productions throughout the decades end up being qualified as 'cult': they simply dare go knee-deep in subjects your typical Hollywood writer wouldn't have the balls to take to the greedy studio manager's desk in the first place! As this review's title states, this one in particular kicks our current society's ""naive hypocrisy"", as I call it, in the nuts by denouncing that, at this day and age of vigilante permissiveness, innocent people (even those belonging to unfortunately stereotyped gender and age groups, as it is the case with our lonely, quiet, divorced protagonist here) do get seriously hurt (usually with dire and life-lasting consequences) now and then by our overwatchfulness - sigh! - even more so when our status quo or business reputation is at risk!As for the filming per se, though some quirk execution shows up now and then (a fairly happy but but, fortunately, full-of-doubt ending plus the seasoned teacher not reporting the innitial 'peck incident' at the day care centre do spring to mind) it's a bold statement of the current state of affairs of how people give in to stereotypes and willingly proceed to a modern-day witch hunt at the blink of an eye.Well done indeed! From both the film making and social criticism point of views."
123,The Hunt,8,8 July 2017,A hard story. Very well told.,"The movie is dark, though very well made. The characters are built very well. Specially that of Lucas. He is shown to be caught in an unfortunate situation and we go through in the movie through his struggle and the prejudice of society placed against him. It is hard in the movie to take sides, every character seems to be doing the right thing. And that is the beauty of the movie. But it is definitely a very touchy and hard topic. I don't know what I would have done in such a situation. It is hard to keep emotions away and act rationally."
124,The Hunt,10,27 June 2017,'Look me in the eyes. What do you see?',"Society. Relationships. Disappointment. While watching a movie, you can often think about yourself and your life, if you look without a sexual subtext and do not look for it, because there not. The only piece of life. Not surprisingly and everything clear, as a hasty society makes conclusions based on only on their fears, and the most important thing that they, as in real, assume something and in the way, they would like to believe. During the ""investigation"" someone obviously did not have enough of adrenaline, as they were provoking her a lie, and she did not say anything, only make some head noodle when you someone pushes. And only that single case when she was angry at Lucas, and only because the girl was disappointed and angry because in kindergarten life parents forgetting about her in some way and arguing on each other, so girl feels some love and idealization of this one person who cares. And her fantasies fall down as in real world. All of this gives us an idea of ​​how the formation of relationships is shaping up in all of us, fantasies, many thoughts and the exploration of the world - everything that children can and see and sometimes understand not well. I want to say that often adults take these child principles into adulthood, fantasies and after it a disappointment. And of course, children can lie and manipulate to parents and others, so they get attention, and this is natural. Lucas was good, kind, but it was bad, he became a victim, and played a victim. It's hard, but showing strength and being more courageous in defending the truth could all be easier to turn up. But, after all really hard events, he became such that he was angry, and that's good, very, it changes, and he changed and he became more courageous and not to lose a friendship, but the past has in mind, and hard to live after that like a couple that lost the kid in ""Manchester by the Sea"" movie, if you saw, and he can hardly live like previous, he is worried, and people as nothing happened to continue to live their normal lives and it's normal and some way interesting, why it hard to him, thoughts and worries. Everything that was happening at that time was fear. Fear controls and with feel aggression and there are people who still remain and still manages with fear after a year of events. Powerful film and so many psychological aspects of which you can write more details (but I have bad English and lazy to put more) and take a look at your life and defend it and do not break in front of a society that thinks individually about yourself, above all. I want to say that it was good to feel this man support and friendship in the movie, it is the strongest vessel there too."
125,The Hunt,,22 June 2017,"Makes you want to pull your hair out, both in good and bad","Danish director Thomas Vinterberg delivers us this jarring drama, starring Made Mikkelsen. He plays a small town man, who works as a kindergarten teacher, until one day a little girl tells a horrible lie about him in a fit of anger, like children sometimes do.I'm more than a little split in regards to this movie. On one hand, it's an extremely well-made film with great mood and atmosphere. The small town life opens up for the viewer beautifully, both its good qualities and also the horrible things possible in such a small community. But on the other hand, the story makes me want to punch something.Let me elaborate. Children tell tales. They speak whatever they please. They have no filter and their worldview especially is still developing. We all know this. Yet this whole movie hinges on the fact that a whole town takes the word of a small girl, barely older than a toddler, as gospel truth. For surely children are pure and innocent and utterly incapable of falsehood. And suddenly it's like straight from the dark ages - witch hunts, pitchforks and stonings included. It's ridiculous.But, to the film's credit, as the story progresses, you start to realize that this is intentional. It's meant to be that way because it's trying to make a point. A horrible, humanity-hating point. And the last third of the film is truthfully very enjoyable as the story arc reaches its high point. But boy did it require some teeth-gnashing to get there.The Hunt is one of the rare films where it actually helps to know a little bit about it before going in, just to avoid that knee-jerk reaction I had. Because it is not a bad film, far from it. It's simply a bit shocking at first, and not in the usual way."
126,The Hunt,10,9 June 2017,A beautiful masterpiece,"The hunt is a clever, well written and well made non trivial dramatic masterpiece that relies on the simple aesthetics of real life, which makes the film emotionally powerful and engaging. It is both disturbing and tragic with its story and its characters. The dialogues are very simple, but the actions and decisions of the characters speak for themselves. In fact, the characters never feel like movie characters. They feel like humans you can talk, relate and feel them, which is the biggest praise this movie can get. The real life part is what makes this movie strong, since everything feels natural and believable. Nothing feels superficial, forced or even a movie. The thematic concept of the film is so tragic and so disturbing, but also raises some questions. All of this is supported by phenomenal performances and beautiful cinematography. The film is simply perfection. Nigh flawless film making."
127,The Hunt,4,30 October 2012,Classic Tearjerker Cinema,"If one liked Dancer in the Dark, Lilya 4-ever, Dogville or a similar movie one will definitely also like Jagten. If so, do not read further and ""enjoy"" an evening of tears. Else, don't be tempted by the interesting theme and the high scores and read some more.Apparently Scandanavian cinema has developed a certain fondness of melodramatic tearjerkers in which perfectly innocent people are completely isolated by an all evil society. Problem with Jagten, and the other mentioned movies as well for that matter, is that every scene is artificially implemented to make as many people cry. Every object, every character has just one goal: make the story sad. Most of them to such an extent that it gets annoying. Even more annoying at that stage was the sobbing of people around me who seemed to be truly moved by what I simply found a shocking lack of psychological depth. The unfolding of events is so predictable and over the top that an interesting theme is denominated to plain entertearment as I would like to call it.In my opinion a good script has the power to show sadness, happiness, love or some other deep emotion in those things that at first sight show no signs of sadness, happiness or love. The story that Jagten brings to the screen is so blunt and obvious that it does not need fancy acting, brilliant photography or any other cinematic effect to make it sad and is therefore a waste of such effects."
128,The Hunt,3,23 November 2012,(Don't) Shoot Me With You Love,"Vinterberg's characters are once again captives of a violent emotional force. But I hate to admit, that what worked so well and ideal in terms of dramatic narration in Festen  give Dogma's style some credit for that  seems a bit out of control in The Hunter. A small child here, holds the grenade and pulls the pin, turning a school teacher to a beast. Over-hyped Mikkelsen, is the victim of fatalism, and there is a constant effort by the movie to lecture us, the battle of persuasion. I wasn't moved by his tragedy, nor fascinated by the climax of this drama. Perhaps if the director asked more questions to justify the accusations, or a more engaging twist, I would appreciate it."
129,The Hunt,2,24 December 2013,would i recommend this one to others? definitely no. not worth the time,"*my review contains not a detailed spoiler BUT a light one(bottom line)*Putting actors' acting or sophisticated analysis of movie aside, if i tell frankly, I felt terrible and enraged whole time watching this movie for the absurdity of the way that people of NL think which i suppose cannot be generalized 100%. it was really heart throbbing and angry to watchthe story is not much. one little damn girl in the kindergarten lied since Lucas didn't accepted her heart though she wanted to kind of rely on him and totally ruined one man's life making him a total outcast.people who's minds are dirty and jump to conclusion enrage me and in this movie there were full of them.why do they treat Lucas that way even there is no evidence and there is as much possibility that a child had lied as the incident had actually happened? how dare could they make an assumption? should they have done ""jagten""?i have no idea why i picked this movie but would i recommend this one to others? definitely no. not worth the time this movie also made me think again of NL"
130,The Hunt,6,8 July 2013,What happens when someone is marked by the society as a sexual pervert...,"Before I watched this movie my expectations were very low. But once again I was attracted by high ratings on IMDb. I really have to explain the plot because of the flaws. It begins very slow and more than a half an hour almost nothing is happening. The key moment happened when main character - local kindergarten teacher is accused for pedophilia by a little girl who is daughter of his best friend and everyone believed her. This is the first hole in the storyline. They didn't suspect that she was fantasizing and lying 'cause she's been always telling the truth even when she said after while that it was made up. After that life of the main character has turned into chaos. People started to despise him for being pedophile. He ended friendship with his best friend and loses his girlfriend. His ex-wife has forbidden to their son to see his father. Other children from kindergarten accused him for sexual assault as well. Someone broke his window and when he went out to see who's done it, he saw his dog lying down dead. Employees from the grocery store has forbidden him to buy food there and is almost beaten to death... Police released him from accusations after finding out that there is no basement where he was sexually abusing children who reported that. One year later his life is normal and he is accepted by everyone again. This is second hole in the storyline. How could he carry on living without finding out who killed his dog for example, who broke his window and almost killed him by that rock?At the end his son becomes member of the local hunting society as being adult. While they were hunting, the main character was almost killed by anonymous person who was shooting at him deliberately but he couldn't see him because Sun has blinded his sight. This is the third hole in the plot 'cause we can't find out who wants his death. Is there any other reason that someone wants him dead except main accusation? The acting by main protagonist was very good. His suffer, pain, anger and injustice that had to abide is highly convincing. Directing is descent in regard to law budget. Somehow I felt emptiness at the end 'cause of the many questions that remained unanswered. The title of the movie is very disputable. 'The Hunt' as the title may refer not only about hunting the animals but also it may refer as sexual predator. Both of them are hunting for a prey on their own way. What was director aiming to I guess we'll never know. Maybe that was the point."
131,The Hunt,8,21 May 2013,Very realistic movie.,"I love to see good foreign movies. Jagten did not disappoint me in that matter. Jagten did not disappoint me at all. The movie is about Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) who is a teacher at a school. Due to circumstances one of the little children named Klara (Annika Wedderkopp) wrongfully accuses Lucas of sexual abuse. This whole accusation gets blown up and Lucas gets fired. Klara drops down as a domino and unintentionally wrecks Lucas's life.Jagten is a very exciting movie. As a viewer I got this weird feeling of hatred against Klara, what means she really performed her part in the movie terrific. Mads Mikkelsen acted a little bit shallow, but you get used to that. His part of being emotional was perfectly taken over by his son played by Lasse Fogelstrøm.For people who are not divorced and don't know how it is to loose you're child, this movie shows what that can do to a man. Not having your own besides you every single day. I know I had to fight, so I can relate to the character Lucas. For the more important matter of this movie, I guess Michael Jackson could have been proud of to see, if he would have been alive.This is a must see with a good cast, fantastic acting, terrific story."
132,The Hunt,10,7 May 2013,"Superb film, will be studied for years to come","Honestly, after watching ""The Hunt (Jagten)"", I was quite puzzled about how to begin writing this review. The confronting and disturbing subject of the film leaves the viewer in a state of shock as you try to comprehend what you have just witnessed.Thomas Vinterberg's work is perfect, and I mean that literally, this film has no fault whatsoever. Mads Mikkelsen as Lucas, the Kindergarten teacher, could possibly be the most superb acting on the big screen. The bone-chilling performance of Annika Wedderkopp was so utterly genuine that it didn't feel as if I was watching a movie.In a small Danish town where everybody knows each other, a quiet rumour can have quite disastrous consequences. I feel it necessary to point out the similarities to Arthur Miller's play, ""The Crucible"". In this work, a small Massachusetts town called Salem, a young girl starts accusing members of the township of witchcraft. Soon after, all the young girls start naming names and suddenly, hysteria and fear grip the village. Sound familiar? ""The Hunt"" has a near parallel storyline, where one accuses another of a hideous crime and soon after, everyone is convincing themselves, despite the validity of the offense. At first, I was rather confused as to why all these adults believed these young children, as well all know, kids lie. The phrase, ""children don't lie"" was uttered by many characters which no doubt, vexed the audience. However, children are innocent and are expected to know nothing, apart from what they had seen. Grethe, played by Susse Wold, probably had doubts of the legitimacy behind Klara's claims. Slowly over time, however, the horrific possibly of crime being true would take control of her logic and force her to do irrational deeds, like ring Marcus' mother to tell her of the crime, even though it had not been validated.What I found most entertaining about the film, is that Klara, I believe on three separate occasions, admitted to lying about the events involving Lucas. Yet her adult superiors convinced her of the truth and the audience could recognise how confused the child actually was. She fluctuated between what was the truth and what was a lie. This is a perfectly natural reaction to the mass hysteria because really, she had no clue what was going on. The music and cinematography were well adapted to the mood of particular scenes, enhancing the effects to a whole new level. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was to be studied by English/arts students. This movie deserves a 10/10."
133,The Hunt,8,20 December 2012,The Hunt is all about Mikkelsen and he makes the film worth the watch,"""Mads Mikkelsen my favourite European actor has made this character who feel victim to rumours so great that by his performance alone the film should be seen because his talents are front and centre"" Written and directed by Thomas Vinterberg this movie shows how people in a small town when they hear the smallest bit of controversy about a character can lead to a lot of hatred. Lucas (Mads Mikkelson) a teacher in a Danish Nursery is accused of sexually abusing Karla (Annika Wedderkopp) a little girl who seemed to be best friends with him before. After rumours spread about Lucas the small community turns on him and he finds it hard to deal with the way people treat him even though he does nothing to defend himself is the main reason that people believe the truth has been told.The story starts off well and once the abuse has been learned by everyone the drama starts to occur and the development of Lucas is slow because he seems to be not well self spoken as he does not say much in his defense against the accusations about him. Also the way the rumours spread seemed very quickly and at times had me confused but the way people treated Lucas such as throwing cans and rocks at him made me feel for this man who had done nothing but was treated in this way. Also his persistence to do nothing such as call police or deny the rumours had me laugh at how unrealistic someone like that would act. At times the film did feel uncomfortable to watch only because of the subject matter that was talked about especially in the pivotal scene of the movie when the main little girl is made speak about the abuse and it asked questions that turned me off because she would be asked these question.Mads Mikkelson plays the strong but quiet Lucas so well, he has such a strong movie presence which just makes my eyes go to him when he is on screen. The character may be quiet but that is the gift Mads gives the character because he plays it to realistic that when he finally lets go in the church service I actually believed that this character would react this way to all the judgment that surrounded him. Thomas Bo Larsen plays his best friend Theo and when he is on screen he is even more quiet as a character which is a great performance by him even though it may not be as emotionally intense as other characters in the movie. Annika Wedderkopp makes her first screen performance and even though she is a young girl I believe her performance is worth talking about. She may have one expression for some scenes but this performance shows me that she does have the skill to be better with age. Even so she made such an impression on me which could do with the role her character plays in the film.Overall the film is a great telling of this tale it leaves me with an ending that I did not make sense of because just when the community is able to accept him the ending shot where someone fires at him still does not make much sense to me. With such a great performance by Mikkelsen at it's centre I recommend that people watch this film even if you could feel uncomfortable at times because of the issues brought up.MOVIE GRADE: B+ (MVP: Mads Mikkelsen)"
134,The Hunt,3,2 January 2013,Very slow - warning: contains spoilers.,"""The Hunt"" is not an action film. If you're looking for action just forget this one. The pace of the film is very, very slow. The actors do a good job interpreting several conditions of human nature, such as giving too much credence to what a little girl says without really verifying facts first. There are many situations that set the story up but aren't credible. There seems to have been a rush to set the stage. First we see this male teacher in is forties playing with kinder children. He has just divorced and is trying to mend fences with his son, who cannot see him as his mother won't let that happen. A little girl is shown a pornographic picture of an erect penis by her brother who also tells her a very graphic description of what's going on in the picture. Next thing, the girl makes, wraps and gives a gift to her male teacher and kisses him on the mouth while playing. The teacher tells her this isn't the right thing and next thing, the girls invents a story telling the principal that her teacher abused her. In the meantime, the teacher has no problem rebuilding his love life. In a matter-of-fact scene, a school colleague who is an immigrant (she isn't fluent in Danish but speaks good English) becomes his lover, you know, just like that. Love at first sight. The films progresses (slowly) showing several situations on how the school principal, the teacher's friends, the girl's parents, the community at large and the teacher himself, deal with this innuendo. The teacher is beaten several times by the town's men. It's curious that the town folk take the law in their own hands. There seems to be a police investigation under way but we never see it. Had it been part of the plot, the police investigators might have shown how the girl lied, how the principal of the school mismanaged the situation and would have put in jail several males in the community who attacked the teacher without really being involved in the problem and who didn't have the facts with them. But the director of the film chose not to include either the police investigation or a trial. This would have spoiled the story. There are two candidates that could have abused the girls: her older brother and her own father. Two scenes lead the viewer to consider that but there's no conclusion. A year after the event we see everybody celebrating the coming of age of the son of teacher in a party. The boy gets his first rifle and goes for his first hunt. His did is also hunting when someone fires a shot a him but misses. We see him on the ground looking at someone with a rifle, aiming at him. He can't see who that person is as the sun is behind him/her, and then this person leaves. In summary, this film shows several values like friendship, love at different levels (between couples, parents-to-children, children-to- parents, among friends), loyalty and perseverance. But the story isn't too solid and many things are taken for granted to make the plot work. This is a slow-paced film - very slow-paced. The end of it is open, in the sense that the situation depicted isn't solved. The stigma on the teacher as a sex abuser will haunt him down and two possible abusers are free to roam in a little Danish town. You can skip this film all right."
135,The Hunt,7,1 February 2015,Leaves many questions unanswered,"This was a great film, which explores how quickly an innocent lie from a kid could turn the life of a seemingly good natured man in chaos. The hunt leaves in my opinion too much for interpretation, and there are some areas of the story that I would have liked be explored in more detail.Major spoiler alert from here: To me the story revolves more around Torsten than what most people realize:1) Torsten is seen crying when him and his sister do the Christmas decorations - Is he really so concerned about his sister, or does he feel guilty for showing her that pornographic picture. Or something more sinister - Was he maybe a victim of Lucas? 2) In the beginning Lucas tells Klara that he used to teach Torsten but that the school was closed down. When he arrives at Theo's house, Torsten seems somewhat strange. 3) When Marcus visits Theo's family Torsten greets him also in a nervous fashion. 4) Torsten killed the dog in my opinion 5) Torsten takes a shot at Lucas in the final scene.It leaves me to wonder - It is clear that Lucas was innocent on the nursery school charges, but I am really playing with the idea that something was up between him and Torsten.I know it may not be the most popular theory, but with a story that leaves so much open for interpretation, it is my most logical conclusion.Sometimes it is great to view films that leave so many questions unanswered, but in this instance, I would have liked a few more plausible hints.Good film however."
136,The Hunt,6,14 June 2013,The Lie That Breaks The Trust,"Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's 2012 production, The Hunt, explores the theme on trust. Trust among children to adults, trusts among friends, family, co-workers and the community are put onto a test when an unexpected lie ruins the life of kindergarten teacher, Lucas. With the uprising Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen as Lucas, The Hunt is not a film that can be easily digested over popcorn and drinks.Set in a small town in Denmark, Lucas was dealing with the custody of his son, Marcus. At the same time, he gets along with his group of close friends, where they hunt, swim in the cold lake and drinks together. When Klara, the daughter of Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), a best friend of Lucas, gets a mistaken idea over the gestures from Lucas, she tells a lie that soon will not only spreads unwanted panic among the community, but also destroys the life of Lucas. Lucas was accused of making an indecent exposure towards Klara, where panic among the parents spreads like wild fire. Lucas becomes the public enemy overnight, and what follows is how he copes and gains back his innocence.Vinterberg is using The Hunt as a mirror reflection on how the current society deals with child's sexual abuse. While it is nothing new that sexual abuse are usually occurred among the closest people the victim knows, The Hunt explores on how trust are being misused and exploited at the same time. To Gretha, the kindergarten principal, she believes in hearing what she wants to hear rather than the truth. This is followed by Ole, a local counselor, who are indirectly pressuring Klara in telling another lie (or more rather, what the adults wants to hear) on how she was violated by Lucas. In no time, the community sees Lucas as a sexual predator towards young children after attending their monthly parent's gathering, where the news of Lucas violating Klara was announced. Vinterberg is showcasing the audience how the breakdown of trust can begin with a lie, and what people prefer to hear. Trust is also seen as something that is very fragile, where all it takes is some negative comments to break the trust that has been build among the community for years.Running at 115 minutes, some audience will find it uneasy to sit through The Hunt. The first half of the film are easy to follow, but soon audience are lost in the labyrinth of trust and misconception, just like how the community are lost in logic and what they choose to believe in. Death threats and ostracizing are issues that plague Lucas, and annoy the audience sometimes. Much areas are left unexplained in the second half of the film. Audience are either given a room to think and reflect, or to left them high and dry. Mikkelsen, who won the Best Actor in Cannes Film Festival 2012, could have been given more time to defend himself and clear his innocence, rather than suffering in silence. No doubt his fine acting skills gave him the credit to win the honor of Best Actor, but at times, it is too much to bear for the audience.Overall, The Hunt is not your usual feel good European independent production. It gives you room to think and examine how fragile trust can be. At the same time, it also tells us how a innocent lie can break a person. While it leaves the audience to think how trusts can be gain, sometimes, audience just wish to see how the empty gaps can be filled up by the director."
137,The Hunt,8,8 April 2013,A haunting tale of guilt and innocence,"Mikkelsen, nothing short of fantastic as usual in his role as a nursery school teacher, single father, just an every day guy, looking for love along side his canine companion, ""Fanny"". But when a secret threatens to shatter his life he finds his world crumbling down around him, in a whirlwind of devastation and betrayal.This film is superbly acted out with some excellent scenes, depicting the true horror of an over-active imagination and a gullible audience.Some critics claim this film is unrealistic in some of the characters, most specifically, the teachers and their reactions to certain events in the film. But if you can overlook what you would expect to happen and accept the reality for a lot of people in this position, then you will find that ""Jagten"" evokes a tremendous sadness and horror.From start to end and it leaves a haunting realisation in its wake that's difficult to shake off, even for the most accustomed viewer."
138,The Hunt,10,3 April 2013,It's a Mads World.,"Scandinavian film makers, actors, directors, and book-writers, must be very near the world-peak of producing the best thought-provoking cinema and reading. 'The Hunt' has to be yet another movie that Hollywood will attempt to emulate, but will it conquer a masterpiece - I think not.The setting has a cold remoteness with its lead character, Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), a warm-hearted kindergarten teacher. An accusation of indecency is voiced by one of the children which results in the small community acting in a manner which has to be viewed as correct. The song, Mad World, sprang to my mind after watching this movie with 'Tears For Fears' very very prevalent.10/10"
139,The Hunt,9,30 March 2013,Riveting,"Lucas(Mads Mikkelsen) is a caring kindergarten teacher who is close to the children of the small Danish school where he works. A series of events lead a student, Klara(a magnificent Annika Wedderkopp), to tell an administrator that Lucas has been sexually inappropriate with her. Little by little, the beloved teacher becomes an outcast to former friends and neighbors. Almost no one believes that a child could make up such a story. It goes from bad to worse for Lucas as the days and weeks go by. Without giving away too much, I will only say, stay with this riveting drama and you will not be disappointed. The acting, the script, and the cinematography are excellent, and The Hunt is one of the best films of the year."
140,The Hunt,6,30 April 2017,About the final,"It was a god story. This movie tells what a lie can do to the life of the person in cause. But this film has a ridiculous ending. It is alright again, he is simply walking on the forest with is kid, and someone ,who we don't know who is he, tries to kill him. Who did that? And why? A really stupid final..."
141,The Hunt,10,6 January 2017,A Truly Scandinavian Movie: talking about the real thing; humans and their inevitably faulty nature.,"This one was a real treat. --- Beforhand: I am not a movie expert. Neither am I a native speaker of English. I may fail to keep it simple for keeping it simple demands a native speaker's skills and command, I believe. ---Trivial stuff first: Great cinematography at times. Great choice of moments to zoom in or out, such that the directing alone tells more about characters than it could in less skillful hands. This makes the characters feel more real.Nice little pieces of music. Always in tune with the movie's momentary mood, imo.---As for the performances, I found it to be convincing enough to stay focused. Never did I feel the movie was forcing itself on me. ---Scenario: Great script, overall. I seldomly felt that certain scenes required a more detailed content so as to clarify the protagonist's intent in taking a certain course of action: How, for instance, was he so quick to choose to continue to be a part of this crowd who previously had been so quick to pass judgments so critical that it could destroy a human being's life for good? How could someone possibly hope to be a part of something that became irreparably tainted, something nowhere near ""whole"" the way it was used to be, something that was shattered so badly that nothing good could come out of it any longer? Maybe, it is my personal concern that I have sought an answer to this. It is just as likely my concern that the only answer I could find is that a sincere hope to uncook a cooked egg is not so rare a psychological response of the common human mind as we hope it to be even when followed by an experience that frequently leads to a common appreciation of a negative relation between rationale and disappointment. Said another way, no matter how useless we know it is, we cannot help hoping for the impossible to happen.---Oh - great symbolism by the way. Not a unique one, but great all the same and what underlies its success is its ability to showcase a table-turning experience only to make a general statement rather than a case-specific one. Let me clarify a bit: The tables can turn for anyone, at any time and not necessarily in accordance with what some choose to call karma: because, yes, life is not fair, the world is not a fair place, it has never been one and we can acknowledge this fact yet still abhor it. Refraining from being part of any game will not absolve you off this universal rule, there is only one way from there on, and that is downhill.If I am to let you in on what this movie is about, without giving away any spoilers as to the plot specifics, then I would say this movie has to do with an inclination to frame people (uninformedly) based on false accusations, sharing the guilt of these false accusations and becoming aware of it and the different ways in which people choose to cope with the shame that accompanies said awareness, thereby sealing the fate of the falsely accused: doubt ""you rather than me"", even if it means you will never be the same again because of my failure to be willing to pay the price - simply, my reluctance to atone.The way the flick dwells on human nature and its tendencies as determined by its inadequacies wherein lies the inevitability of it all... is both depressing and relieving; the way confessions often are to a human being. It just cuts to the chase and makes us face up one of the main causes of insecurity: how we see things totally depends on where we stand, and where we stand might change in the blink of an eye, against our will. We are small, the world is large and, yes, although we like to pretend otherwise, the fact remains that we attribute too much of our content feelings to our free will and little to mere chance -those things we cannot control- but it is, indeed, the other way around."
142,The Hunt,8,2 August 2016,Looking for a tragic movie?,"Movies with great acting, plot and ending are very few in this world, and Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt is one of them. Such great acting by one of the most underrated actors of all time. I really hope that more people see this movie. Incredible movie. I'm mad at myself for waiting this long to see it. A round movie with a fantastic Mads Mikkelsen. Honestly, I think this movie would have been even better with some more minutes on it to develop the plot even further. A troubling movie that keeps you pinned and rooting for answers, and it does not disappoint. The Hunt is a tense, nerve wracking experience from start to end. Mads Mikkelsen's strong performance is the soul to this heartless story. He portrays his character's suffering masterfully alongside other noteworthy aspects of this successful drama."
143,The Hunt,9,4 July 2016,I Hope This Is Overblown Fiction,"This is an outstanding and important movie, but it seems far-fetched in how it creates the dramatic situation for the leading character. Well, at least I hope it does! Conspiracy theorists like to rant and rave about ""juvenile justice"", especially in Scandinavia (typically Norway), but even so, I really hope things couldn't go so badly in real life as they do here in _The Hunt_ for the leading character. Yes, I know that the screenwriters based this movie on a real-life case (possibly a series of such cases), but even so, I hope they took ""the artists' shortcut"" in order to depict the exact circumstances of the drama we can experience here.Don't get me wrong: I have no illusions about human nature, and I fully believe it's possible for an entire town or community to turn on an individual and ostracize him or her for no reason at all, without any evidence (perhaps even lynch him or her, in less enlightened societies than the current Danish one  but as could be seen, even the supposed enlightenment in today's West has its severe limitations or perversions). And it's not a new phenomenon by any means, of course; while watching _The Hunt_, I was frequently reminded of Nathanael Hawthorne's masterpiece, _The Scarlet Letter_.It is precisely the depiction of herd thinking that is the biggest asset of _The Hunt_. There is no stupider and falser proverb than ""There's no smoke without fire"" (even Agatha Christie knew that), but most people seem to hold it to be true anyway. This instinctive herd thinking applies to *any* area of human life; yes, the human race likes to view itself as the ""homo sapiens"", but if truth be told, most humans just hate exercising their thinking capabilities. The *potential* for thinking, especially for thinking *independently*, is there in each of us  but it appears that most people willingly forgo that capability, and instead prefer to let themselves be driven by *herd instincts and impulses* which, then, makes them more akin to our animal co-inhabitants of this planet. That is why alcohol (nicely depicted in _The Hunt_, too) and drug addiction are so popular among humans: they cloud their thinking capabilities, and many people *prefer* their thinking to be clouded; to blunt the promptings of their conscience, perhaps, or to blunt the recognition, perhaps, that life as they live it day-to-day does not really make much sense or create any *genuine* (not artificially induced) joy.And so, _The Hunt_ could have chosen any area of human life and endeavour to depict the dangers of blind herd thinking; it did not have to deal with sex at all; but, naturally, the more ""salacious"" the subject matter, the more interest a movie like this is likely to generate, and so, the subject matter was, ultimately, well-chosen by the film-makers. I just really hope than an experienced person like Grethe wouldn't jump to conclusions so fast, in real life, as she does in _The Hunt_. I also wonder how much the hysteria is due to the tabooization of nudity in our society. If it's OK for a kindergarten manager to talk about ""willies"" with the kids entrusted to her, why should the idea of an *erect* willie make someone like Grethe lose her mind instantly? That was the least credible aspect of _The Hunt_, I thought. Willies are part of life (and Grethe knows that), but erect willies are part of life, too. Even if it happened, through an unfortunate accident (such as that with the irresponsible teenagers cavorting with the iPad), for a child to catch a glimpse of that male-only biological occurrence  well, there should be a way to explain that biological occurrence to a small child without hysteria or calling an all-parents' meeting and the police right away. At least I hope so!_The Hunt_ nicely shows the limitations of our current ""social sciences"", such as the inane child psychologist with his leading questions. And no, *those* were not overblown, as the McMartin ""invented abuse"" case from the US of the 1980s proved. Our society puts too much trust in doctors, and psychologists among them, I'm afraid; just because someone has a diploma and is considered an expert in their field, does not mean they cannot behave foolishly, wilfully and irresponsibly, just like Ole the child psychiatrist does in _The Hunt_.We were meant to sympathize with the leading character throughout the movie, and of course we did, but in one aspect, I couldn't help thinking, while watching _The Hunt_: ""You had it coming!"" I mean Lucas's predilection for venison as his favourite meal, and for killing deer senselessly just for the pleasure of hunting. Yes, it's a ""pleasure ritual"" going back centuries, but isn't it time to let it go in the 21st century? Aren't deer just as defenseless when they are being hunted by humans who hold that killing spree to be ""fun"", as Lucas is later defenseless against the senseless attacks of his community? This reminded me of Hitchcock's _Birds_: you imprison birds at the start of the movie, but then suddenly, the situation turns around and *you* become the attacked (""hunted"" here) party. The movie title here has, therefore, double significance.The movie's direction is flawless, just spot-on throughout, the script and dialogues lean and tense as they should be, and the actors' performances are nothing short of amazing. Of course Mads Mikkelsen is superb in the leading role, but so are many others (Susse Wold is thoroughly convincing as Grethe), especially including the little girl, Annika Wedderkopp. I'm stunned as to how the film-makers managed to get such a performance out of a little girl like that. The thing is, it didn't even seem to be a ""performance"", but she really was as if cut out from real life, creating the sense of watching a documentary movie. Hats off, ladies and gentlemen!"
144,The Hunt,9,17 March 2016,2012 was a good year for Masterpieces,"The Hunt is one of the best films from 2012, to put it simply. Whilst the pacing does take a little while to develop at first, once it hits, it hits hard. Needless to say I was glued to the screen and refused to pull away.I wont tell you the summery for the Hunt for you must have clicked on this film's page in order to get here, sop read it from there. But what I shall say is that this film has no where near the right amount of attention it deserves. Whilst the story isn't so complex it requires your utmost attention (Unless you don't speak Danish then... well it does) but it is one that, come the end, does deserve some insight which I can tell will already have some shaking their heads, so in that, despite my love for this work of art, it's not for everyone. Its riveting plot combined with its interesting and incredibly well defined characters makes for one hell of a film. I'm a naturally angry person, so take it from me when I say, this film got me more than angry... or at least, more angrier than I needed to be at 2 o'clock in the morning. The trip of emotions this film shall take you on will be one to remember, from pure hatred to pure anger, to relief, to satisfaction. Mads Mikkelsen did a tremendous job of performing his character, I might even say it to be his best, accompanied by a pretty great child actor (Annika Wedderkopp). All of the acting was pretty solid and really brought this film to life. The cinematography and the amazing soundtrack really flowed pretty much perfectly with one another, giving yet more life to an otherwise dark and dead toned film.I do have a few issues however. One being how sometimes the character logic ranged from really annoying to unbearable in my opinion. Like apparently no one tries to convince anyone about anything until it's almost mandatory to further the plot. It really felt like the plot was being stretched there. The other issue being with Annika Wedderkopp. Like I said she did a pretty damn fine job but there were at least 5 times where she slipped up and became a little too unconvincing. Anyway I'd go check this out if I were you for it is one of the best films from 2012 followed by my all time favourite film ""Amour"". Thomas Vinterberg, Bravo my friend, bravo."
145,The Hunt,9,25 January 2016,When accusation is enough...,"Anyone can put an idea in your head. Some ideas hold, some do not, and some can burrow into your head and change the way you perceive the people around you.Director Thomas Vinterberg takes a simple idea, and turns it into a masterpiece of storytelling. I had never seen any of his previous films, but was completely spellbound by the events that unfolded in what is essentially a single event, that leads to disaster. Mads Mikkelsen portrays Lucas, a kindergarten teacher in a small Danish town. He appears to like his life, his job, and goes to work with a smile on his face. He's well known in the community, has many friends, is working on custody of his son, and even has a love interest years after his divorce.The real magic of this film is how this one event unfolds before you, from the most innocent of sources it changes his life dramatically and possibly forever. A character leading a life that could be any one of us, and it really drives home the fact that sometimes to be simply accused is enough to lose everything you hold dear.A memorizing story, very true to life in it's many facets. It would be an absolute shame if you miss this one.9/10"
146,The Hunt,9,4 January 2016,fantastic .. Nothing else,"This movie is really fantastic with every scene in it .. the story is wonderful I can tell .. It's all about the story .. It Summarizes itself in a very small dangerous phrase "" I'm guilty Who said that ? - the people did "" the people will not wait for any proof or any judgment from the court to accused you .. people's talk is enough to prove you are guilty .. yea really bad manners in ourselves we need to get rid of them immediately or the society will fall down to bottom .. who should we blame ? .. the small little girl or we could call her creepy with her big eyes "" It was definitely a good choice "" .. Or we blame her brother the guy who showed her the porn picture and make her indirectly think in those things .. Or her head teacher who refused to listen him and without hesitation decided to believe the girl .. Or her father who also refused to talk to her and understand what happen .. and all he do is to listen to his wife .. Good movie .. no wonder that the movie nominated for the Oscars .. the Oscars does really like this kind of movies .. a small mistake shows the people who they really are and someone has to pay for it"
147,The Hunt,,2 January 2016,Lucas and his fight to hold onto his reputation.,"I found this movie on Netflix streaming. It was one of the nominees for the Academy Award for best foreign language film. Danish with English subtitles. It mainly takes place during November and December of a year, then the final part is almost one year later.The movie stars Mads Mikkelsen as Lucas, a 42-yr-old man who is working at the local kindergarten after the school he had been working at was closed. It probably doesn't pay much but the little kids like him and he seems to enjoy the fun with them. He is divorced and his young teen son lives with his mother but seems to want to move in with dad.There is a quick incident near the beginning of the movie, where two teenage boys are coming into their home with an Ipad. They are viewing porn photos, one with a man's enlarged and erect penis in the photo. They quickly show it to the young sister, 5-yr-old Klara, and they make a comment about it ""pointing up to the sky.""We sense the boys are up to mischief but don't think too much of it until an innocent incident at school and Klara makes up a story of Lucas showing her his penis ""pointing up to the sky"", clearly mimicking what the boys had said. However the school mistress needs to follow up and calls a school psychologist of sorts for advice and for him to talk to the child, an effort to see if there is anything to it. Now here's where everything goes off the rails, and I suspect this may be closer to the truth than we want to believe. The man asks Klara to tell him what she told the school mistress. But she is hesitant, she is smart enough to know her innocent lie was becoming something she had no intention of. But instead of the two adults listening to the child's responses start to ask her leading questions, in essence telling her what they wanted to hear, until they felt sure Lucas was guilty. The fallout escalated quickly.So the movie is mostly about the general issue of a very young child making a sexual accusation against an adult and the difficulty sorting out the truth. Here in the USA we read about such cases periodically, usually involving a school teacher or coach, and while they often turn out true, especially with young teachers and high school teenagers, I always wonder if the student or students are lying to get the teacher in trouble. It isn't always easy to sort out.In the case of Lucas here the audience knows more than any one character in the movie, and we are pretty certain Lucas has been wrongly accused, but can he ever reestablish his good reputation?When the movie ends almost a year later and Lucas is out hunting deer with others and their high-powered rifles, Lucas sees a deer then hears a shot, the bullet hitting the tree next to him. Was that a warning shot? Can he ever be safe, knowing some may always believe he was guilty? Fade to black.Good movie, Mads Mikkelsen is really good in his role."
148,The Hunt,10,24 November 2015,Emotional Roller-coaster,"I've seen a few ""modern"" movies with great acting and 3d characters/good development, but the hunt was one of the best along with Tyrannosaur and Calvary.Thomas Vinterberg did a really good job in creating emotional intense scenes, much like in Festen aka The Celebration.A must see film, in a decade filled with Hollywood mainstream blockbuster hits.Mads Mikkelsen is great along with all supporting cast. It is quite emotional draining but it's worth it. It isn't a subject that will be ""touched"" too often, not now and i'm quite sure not in the near future as well."
149,The Hunt,10,22 November 2015,Beautifully Constructed,"I think the tension between Lucas and the whole village is one of the most beautiful and well made tension construction I've seen in a while. The whole lots of possibilities and interpretations show us how rich this story is.At the end of the movie, we can see the damage on Lucas' life. And this is scary. As most of horror/terror movie fans would say - the best monster/ghost/enemy/antagonist is the one you cannot see the face, but the one who gets you to imagine what could happen if it catches you - with that in mind, we can see that the script is a masterpiece in that aspect.The direction help all this fear, doubt and anger come inside us and that is horrifying and creepy. This is a must-see for anyone who enjoys quiet thrillers."
150,The Hunt,9,29 September 2015,Profoundly disturbing psychological drama - with a devastating conclusion!!!!,"The Hunt (Danish: Jagten) is a 2012 Danish drama film directed by Thomas Vinterberg and starring Mads Mikkelsen. The story is set in a small Danish village around Christmas.Mads Mikkelsen won the Best Actor Award at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival for his penetrating portrayal of Lucas, a former school teacher who has been forced to start over having overcome a tough divorce and the loss of his job. Just as things are starting to go his way, his life is shattered when an untruthful remark throws his small community into a collective state of hysteria. As the lie spreads, Lucas is forced to fight a lonely fight for his life and dignity."
151,The Hunt,10,28 September 2015,Brilliant Movie from Vinterberg,"I have to start by saying that I am a big fan of Vinterberg and Zentropa films in general; however, even if I didn't know who directed this movie, I would have the same opinion. The subject matter has certainly been covered before, or related matters, as in the pivotal 1961 film, The Children's Hour. However, in my opinion, this film hit the best pitch in emotion and the precision with which it deals with the delicate circumstances and devastations involved. I was spellbound by Mads Mikkelsen's performance. Just when I thought he would do something drastic or the film would lapse into melodrama, it all stayed the course. It is a film about forgiveness, all kinds of forgiveness, forgiveness for the self and for others. But lest we forget, and the film artfully doesn't let us, forgiveness doesn't always occur and is one of the hardest tasks we have in life, or that is what I took from it; others will take something else. I was very moved and held in deep emotional suspense by this film, which is what the best films do. Just brilliant, on all levels, by all involved. This film was nominated for or won almost 100 awards and I am so glad it got the recognition it deserves, esp in light of the subject matter."
152,The Hunt,9,6 September 2015,This movie made me unhappy,"My point is 9 for this movie. Because this movie is amazing, you can see with this movie one lie how can destroy your entire life.And you can see with the final scene nothing will be okay, nothing will be like before.This movie 155 minute and I disturbed total 145 minute of this movie. Guys show a photo to little girl and with the effect of that photo lied to someone. And that lie destroyed entire life of him.Nobody believed to him, even his best friend, his girlfriend too.Performances very important for movie. This movie is amazing for so many thing, but honestly another important thing in the movie is the feelings which you lived during movie. I wrote that before that I disturbed during 145 minute of this movie. That things what happened after lie, all that things, supermarket scene made me unhappy. I like to feel happy after film, hoped 145 minute everything will be good and final scene will be good, but in the final scene someone shoot to Madds : many people perhaps didn't understand it. My thinking is final scene showed to us there is nothing will be okay. Great, disturbing, unhappy movie.p.s my English isn't well"
153,The Hunt,10,18 June 2015,Bizarre vulnerability,"Such an amazing story. It's fascinating how child's sayings, words or even nodding could ruin a grown man's life in a moment and make him feel helpless. Especially in a small and conservative society like this one. I tried putting myself in Lucas' head during the movie and it was quite frustrating. People talk, stories like this spread extremely fast. Before you know it, the whole village is talking about the incident that actually didn't happen but you can't do anything about it, can you? Anyway, a really sensitive but interesting topic. I watched the most of the movie with my breath held and therefore highly recommend it. PS: Thrilled (again!) with Danish production, of course, including the actors (Klara did an incredible acting job)."
154,The Hunt,10,13 June 2015,One of the few films that actually frustrated me,"I certainly don't find myself in the category of movie watchers who think that something is gonna change in the plot if they talk to the characters. I actually find it really annoying when other people keep commenting during the film. However this time I totally felt like I was in the movie, like I needed to change what's gonna happen, like make the girl ""tell the truth"" or make the main character ""insist about being innocent"".In fact the movie was so powerful it made you wonder what you could possibly do in a similar situation being the main character, his son or one of the family friends. It indicated in the best way how our society still remains medieval, how from one moment to another civilized people can become animals hunting for blood , seeking revenge, actually wanting to ""burn the witches"". Definitely one of the best films I've watched."
155,The Hunt,9,5 June 2015,Makes you real angry,"The main thing I will say about this movie, is that is makes you very, very mad. Well, made me, anyway.I am allergic to spoilers, so I can't say why, but trust me, you will be so frustrated by this. You will probably hate some of the characters. Now this is danish, so everyone, absolutely everyone will need subtitles. (little joke/stab at Denmark there! nobody, not even Danes themselves understand that language)Mads Mikkelsen, aka Hannibal, does a very fine job. He reacts so natural and realistic, you really feel for him.The subject matter is one that I think it's pretty hard to make a movie about, so I applaud the director. There is not that much for me to talk about in this review, really, all I can say it is a frustrating, but very good movie. You are left with this chilling, split soft of, feeling after watching it. Very good!"
156,The Hunt,10,31 May 2015,Beautiful movie,"Excellent movie about people who blindly believe the horrifying story about a honest noble man who is nothing but innocent, but has to sacrifice his life and tries to passively defend from the occurrences that follow. His will is stronger than the shots he take in his everyday life. A man's life can be ruined over a simple word spoken in the wrong time and to the wrong people. A simple mistake, made his life path seem doomed at the time, but the patience and kindness, got his hopes up. The friendship is not always strong enough to overcome a simple situation if carefully observed. Mads Mikkelsen performance is outstanding. One of the best foreign movies in the 00s."
157,The Hunt,9,4 May 2015,"Come, Join the Witch-Hunt in Vinterberg's Kafkaesque Nightmare!","The Hunt is a nerve-shattering drama that provides brutal, thought- provoking answers to the tough questions it asks - an extremely riveting, skillfully put together psychological thriller, whose only tools are human character traits.The film centers on Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), a genial kindergarten teacher in a small Danish community who has recently been through a bitter divorce. Rather than seek greener pastures, he remains in his provincial hometown, hunting and carousing with his lifelong buddies while negotiating the custody of his teenage son. While there is some speculation about why he lives alone, he's valued for his affectionate relationships with the children in his care. Disaster strikes when one of his pupils, a five-year-old girl, unwittingly makes a startling accusation against him  that of sexual misconduct. Everyone chooses to believe the child and the community flies into a frenzy of self-righteousness, without holding a shred of evidence against him. He suddenly finds himself ostracized by people he believed were his friends. As the lie spreads and becomes accepted as truth, despite his protests, everything Lucas values is thrown into jeopardy, from his friendships to his relationship with his son to his very life. His life soon spirals into a Kafkaesque labyrinth of misunderstanding and suspicion right up to the climax, where the movie ends on an unresolved note - a clanging minor key chord of doubt that hangs frozen in the air.The Hunt starts out slow, introducing a peaceful small town but all the while quietly building a sinister tension that pervades every frame. At first, the sense of impending doom is dismissible, but the genius of Thomas Vinterberg's gentle direction and the film's perfectly paced script is that the dread creeps over you, slowly but surely, until you feel as petrified and powerless as the film's protagonist. The script doesn't peddle in one-dimensional characters or plot contrivances: nothing's forced, and nothing's ever less than frighteningly plausible. But it has an insinuating pull that takes us into the dark realms of the human psyche. Vinterberg re-affirms his stand as a director with brooding power and ruthless precision, a fluid storyteller and a shocking choreographer of violence by using a sharp cinematic knife to cut to the core of the matter: that the human heart can never be entirely civilized.The acting on all fronts is outstanding, with Mads Mikkelsen at the center of the hysteria delivering a sublime performance. Inflecting every line of dialogue with excruciating pain, frustration and confusion, he creates a brilliantly flawed protagonist. Initially, his inert reaction to the indictments are baffling and infuriating, but as the film progresses, Mikkelsen lets us inside Lucas and allows us to discover the reasons for ourselves. You leave The Hunt unsettled in the best sense. Its images and implications are likely to stay in your head a long time!"
158,The Hunt,9,1 May 2015,One That I Will Adore,"This movie got nominated for Best Foreign Film in the Oscars and Golden Globes, and I can really see why it did. This movie really pulled me in once the plot picks up. The movie does a good job on showing what it's like for someone to be falsely accused of a lie like this. This story has nothing insanely big or epic at all. It's all supported by the emotional performances, which is why I love this movie. Movies like Dallas Buyers Club and Still Alice are like this and those movies are in my top 25 favorites. This movie is as well because of how raw and real the performances are in this film.Mikkelson is really well known for those dark and evil roles that we saw in Casino Royale and Hannibal. This is a very different type of role. He's a very likable guy and it's hard to see what his character is going through. The movie also shows what people do to Mikkelson's character and it just gets me down to the bone. The things they do are just awful and really frustrate me because it doesn't make them any better. They're really just stooping down to his level.My only gripe with this film is that the last 15 minutes could have been better. It skips maybe a year later and that seemed simple. They could have maybe shown how it leads up to the next year. Then they could show the last 15 minutes.This emotional driven movie pulled me in within the first act and kept me invested with everything that was happening for the rest of the film. Mads Mikkelson gave a pronounced performance that we usually don't see. It would have been nice if things were added to lead up to the final 15 minutes, but this is a movie that gave me many different emotions in a very good way."
159,The Hunt,9,19 November 2014,All men should watch 'The Hunt',"The Hunt - Brilliant script, powerful performances and a well directed movie. We hear, read lots of news about sexual harassment's nowadays. Do we really care how many were true at the end. It may be a small percent but what is happening to the accused who were actually innocent and acquitted by law. Climax of the movie says it all, he will be hunted for life time. Its so sad that we are living in a world where we can't openly express our love, emotions even to a child! Rather have to think consequences it may create. Most times people are judgmental and you may not even get a chance to explain. On the other hand its true that child harassment is drastically increasing. My advise to all men out there is to watch this movie and decide yourself."
160,The Hunt,10,10 November 2014,Absolutely Blew Me Away,"Never have i watched a film and still thought about it days later and never has a film had such an effect on me. I am not usually a fan of foreign films but i thought i would give this a go as the ratings were good and WOW. It is simply the best film i have ever seen.The Acting is absolutely superb from all parties especially Mads Mikkelsen who's performance is stunning. The story line is perfect and well thought out. It certainly makes you think! I have seen all the greats but in my eyes nothing comes close to this. I have demanded my friends to watch it. Its a gripping story and an emotional roller coaster. I will certainly be keeping an eye out for more upcoming Danish films, especially ones starring Miks.100% Must watch!!!"
161,The Hunt,9,21 August 2014,Villain-free Villainy,"Incredibly rich material for moral philosophy. This story will put you on several different shoes and probably lead you to analyze your own conduct. Though the antagonists and the climax are clearly present and labeled, when you evaluate the situation beneath the surface, it is hard to spot a real villain. The villainy is in life and how it can suddenly get complicated. I personally use this as an argument on how destructive pornography can be in so many ways, but this is just me. People will draw different conclusions and many times, no one is really to be blamed.Needles to say (just read the critics and many users reviews), the acting and directing are an spectacle that move you deeply. If you are worried about this being a foreign film, just don't watch it, cause you ain't worthy of it."
162,The Hunt,10,25 April 2014,Beautiful,"This movie is a must-see. Especially for people who haven't seen many films outside the western film industry. The concept is highly relevant to the way we suspect people, and how much suspicion can completely destroy someone's life. All the characters are acted and behave in an extremely believable way. The film is directed perfectly. It's a smart move to make extremely minimal use of music in a film like this because it allows the tension to arise simply from the events taking place in the film and the way the characters are reacting to them.The main actor gives a heart-wrenching performance that manages to not only properly develop his growth as the events of the film slowly become more chaotic and tragic, but also resonates with the person watching (in this case me) because he behaves in the way we (normal timid citizens) would likely react to being accused of sexual abuse unjustly. The brilliance in this film is that it manages to avoid vilifying anyone in this movie. Despite characters accusing Lucas (main character) of things he didn't do, they are portrayed as normal, good people who are trying to protect themselves and their families, rather than bullying the main character out of sadism which would make the plot cheesy. It is extremely hard to separate fact and fiction with situations like this, so it is understandable that they would behave this way. This leaves us conflicted because while we sympathize with Lucas's character, there are no antagonists to shift blame on. More things need to be written this way, instead of drama movies constantly turning everything into a struggle between good and evil. The movie is realistic, emotional, and beautifully made and I would recommend this to anyone who has an open mind and loves cinema."
163,The Hunt,9,19 December 2013,The Hunt - Noodles Review,"This is a lesser known film (probably because it's foreign) but it's definitely a great one. The Hunt is a Danish film concerning the a man named Lucas, played by Mads Mikkelsen. You may know him as the Bond villain from Casino Royale or as Hannibal Lecter in the show Hannibal. He's a phenomenal actor and he really shows that here (I'd be surprised if didn't get nominated for this). In this film, he plays an innocent- minded teacher. What I love about this movie is that it's so grounded and real. You really believe that this guy, Lucas, is a real person and everything that happens in the movie is so believable. He's a recently divorced guy who's close to getting custody of his son; he's starting a new relationship; as a teacher, all the kids love him. His life is a pretty positive one at the moment, until... one little girl decides to tell a little lie and falsely accuse him of sexually harassing her. And even though there's no evidence of this, Lucas's life begins to crumble. It all happens so realistically and that's credit to the writing and direction of this movie. When I watched this movie, I literally sat forward in my seat, motionless, witnessing the events of the film unfold. There's no special effects or spectacular events; it's just pure raw emotion in an intensely believable situation. One of the best compliments I can give a foreign-language film is that I forget that I'm reading the subtitles because I'm so engrossed in what's happening. To me, this is one of the best crafted films of recent years. Not everyone can watch it because a lot of people would find it boring or uninteresting, but it is just beautiful to me."
164,The Hunt,9,7 December 2013,My 100th Review: The Hunt,"A very special achievement, huh?! My first hundred circle of reviews is now closed with a golden key: My 100th review is about one of the very best foreign films released recently, one of the most acclaimed films of the last year and rightfully so: it deserves all the praise it garnered. I'll talk about The Hunt.The narrative used in this story is brilliant; despite being a film that focuses in the psychological aspects of a character,it does not give attention ONLY to the protagonist, that is in this case, Lucas(masterfully interpreted by Mads Mikkelsen). It also focus in the psychological state of secondary characters, giving us a certain feeling of 'intimacy' with these characters. Intelligent choice for this film, in my opinion. I also liked the Hunt allegory in the film, and i have my own theory to explain what it was meant to be: Lucas can be seen as the good, the innocent, and yes, The Hunt. The entire world seems to be full of hunters, despicable in their own nature, people which raises their children to be despicable hunters just like them. In fact, the innocence and the goodness by Lucas is in my opinion due the fact that he didn't turn into a hunter, which means an adult - he was just pretending all the time. The fact is: he is not really a hunter(adult), but a hunt(innocent) , what explains why he loves children(that also represents innocence). It is because he is one of them, he has an innocent soul, which likes to be with other 'innocent' souls, and not with the hunters.We can see the frustration of Lucas in the end of the film, when his then 'innocent' son is making a 'traditional rite' to finally turns into a hunter, which also means -turning into an adult.To add a bit more information, The Hunt itself is always the weakest animal. In that case, Lucas is a children, the weakest kind of person, trying to make fun with the other children. The Hunters do see Lucas as one of them though, and this starts all his problems.The acting of the entire cast is good, including by the little girl, but i have to highlight specifically Mads Mikkelsen performance in that film. Such a fantastic showing. He expressed much more about his character with simple gestures than with words. Just by his face we can assume that he is a both sad and disturbed individual, which for me, in the way i see it, it's a thing extremely hard to do if the actor is only using facial expressions.I highly recommend this film. An excellent piece of cinema for those who likes smart and well made films. 8.9/10"
165,The Hunt,9,18 November 2013,A Danish Art House surprised me,"The film is thin like a blade. The protagonist is a believer who hunting deer. He deprives of life of innocent animals. The analogy is that the crowd in this film the hunted on the innocent protagonist. The protagonist says about deer, which he did not kill ""They would come back"". Similarly he like a deer returns to the people who hunted him. Ostracism by the people still possible to survive, but the treachery of friends can break a man forever. But the protagonist with dignity passed all the tests. I especially liked the scene at the climax of the film, when on the event all these sneaky people smiled at him and he looked at them with a smirk and in his eyes were the words ""Meanness incorrigible"". A stunning game of actors. Great script and a brilliant director's work"
166,The Hunt,8,10 October 2013,Strong drama with very strong actors,"This rather likely story is set in a small Danish township and follows a male teacher who becomes the target of alienation and violence after being wrongly accused of indecent exposure to a small girl. The topic is painful and severe, but, from the start, the audience is able to realise that Lucas is innocent, thus one can follow the progress of events, not to ponder and hesitate on what could have (not) occurred. The title has multiple meanings, and the events - in the Thomas Vinterberg style, with some expected and many unexpected solutions - flow towards the sudden ending. The latter is decent, but I would still have preferred a more sophisticated one.The cast is brilliant, beginning with Mads Mikkelsen, who is definitely the most versatile contemporary Danish actor - all films with his presence are worth watching, his interpretation of different characters is always non-trivial. The other distinct performer is Annika Wedderkopp as Klara, the 5-years-old girl, who is the centre of both warmhearted and grievous moments throughout the film... The character played by Thomas Bo Larsen - one of the customary Vinterberg's actors - spends rather limited time on screen, but the result is still catchy.A must-see to them fond of gossiping or having superficial knowledge based on tabloid materials. However, the film is not for everyone and it is hard to imagine to be watched as a family film - despite the fact that children of different ages have important roles there."
167,The Hunt,5,29 May 2013,Film Unintentionally Criticizes Itself,"5.1 of 10. What's funny is this film essentially ends up criticizing itself because it does the same thing the villains of it do. It creates a scarecrow story filled with innuendo and partial truths that feed on people's empathy only to turn an innocent young girl into a potential object of rage and abuse. If people were required to watch Hysteria (2011) after this film, I'd like it a lot more.The technical aspects of the story telling and filming are exceptional. Despite its earthy realistic plot, settings, characters, and filming, don't confuse it with a documentary or even inspired by a true story. Very young children may not lie, but they certainly are capable of anger, exaggeration, and gossip like adults. I don't know if we need another film on that, at least not one told the way this one is. Better left in the art house for examining the technical skills the writer, director, and camera people show."
168,The Hunt,5,30 July 2013,Evil,"I have watched the movie and would have voted for 10 for the message of the film. But only 1 for en enjoyment of the movie. I have newer been so angry while watching a movie before. I felt like shooting all the people in the city one by one. But then again, that makes the movie so brilliant, because it had such a big influence on me. The message is good, but it ruined my entire evening. That is why I didn't gave it more votes. Personally a good movie is a movie you enjoy watching, which I didn't at all! I would have been happy if the movie ended in a carnage. The main person going insane because of the city. Tearing, ripping and destroying everyone! That would have been yet another message to bevare of."
169,The Hunt,8,6 March 2017,Quietly devastating,"The skill of this film is that it can ask an emotionally loaded question without apportioning blame or stoking hatred: in that respects, it's rather like its main character.Nursery teacher Lucas leads a quiet life, only seeming to come out of himself when he's horsing around with the children at school. He has a natural affinity with children, so it's unsurprising that they're drawn to him, too - especially Klara, who has a crush on him. Later, when he reprimands her for something, she tells a lie that implicates him in sexual abuse. Once the lie is told, it quickly gathers pace, to fraught consequences.These consequences are what the film is about and, while The Hunt is a drama, it's an incredibly tense and moving one as a result: it's hard not to be swept away by the tumult of emotions, from the anger felt by parents and neighbours, to indignation and pain on Lucas's behalf.The Hunt asks questions about how we respond to allegations of sexual abuse, and pulls no punches about our human, instinctive reactions on the subject. It does this especially powerfully through some very natural, realistic performances - everyone here is believable and compelling, none more so than Lucas and Klara.Ultimately this is a very sad film (or at least, it uncovers something very saddening about human nature). For its few brief flashes of hope and friendship, there's a very strong sense that consequences can be caused in an instance, last forever, and are the thing that decides our strength of character - good or bad."
170,The Hunt,7,2 January 2017,"Wow, what a surprise in this politically correct world","To my surprise I get to see this movie, without expecting much of it, everything has to be said. I find myself with difficult film. Difficult for what counts, for the position taken by the director, for how it counts but I think it comes out afloat and very well. It makes you feel bad, you feel bad for him. For me it is a good idea to put at the beginning what happened with the girl and how everything has happened and how the girl reacted. If I had not done so, I should have explained it later and it would have been worse. If he had managed to get the spectators to remove from our retina what we thought of the protagonist since if he did not know, nobody in his right mind would have gone with him.I think he's well kept up and how he counts. Although the rest of the address is not surprising but rather austere. It has no nice blueprints or anything.Neither has a spectacular photograph.The grace of this film is to get into the area that has gotten and to put the side that never is never counted."
171,The Hunt,8,5 December 2016,Great touching movie you must see,"Jagten or The Hunt in English, is the 8th movie directed by Thomas Vinterberg. Known for Festen, Vinterberg created with Lars Von Trier the Dogme95, an avant-garde filmmaking movement. ""These were rules to create filmmaking based on the traditional values of story, acting, and theme, and excluding the use of elaborate special effects or technology. It was an attempt to take back power for the director as artist, as opposed to the studio."" The Hunt is about a kindergarten teacher, who will get his life brutally shattered when a little girl tell a lie about him. This movie will approach a dark subject, from an unusual point of view.Let's go back to the movie. The cast of the movie is amazing. Mads Mikkelsen is a well-known actor all over the world, who plays the main character, is unbelievable. He makes us feel every emotion like we were him. The actress who plays the little girl is great too. She's unaware of all of the consequences, but she's trying to repair what she did. You will care for the characters. The color palette, between blue and brown, depicts the feelings and is poignant. I was really impressed by the colorimetry and its role in the movie. Something between love, and hate.Be careful, there'll be spoilers from now.During the movie, you will want to slap the face of the inhabitants. However, you can understand their point of view on the subject and the fear they experience. By doing that, I think Vinterberg is talking about our judgmental society and its aftermaths.A lot of the story is told in silence or with looks. The narration is intelligent. The last scene is open to interpretation. I understand this as, even if he is forgiven in the end, the inhabitants won't forget what happened and will never totally accept him as before. In conclusion, it was, for me, a really touching movie and it was difficult for me not to cry."
172,The Hunt,6,9 November 2015,Not true to life,"I am surprised by the high rating by all the viewers and it maybe because of the controversial subject. I felt the portrayal of it was rather subdued and not in line with reality. Take for example the kindergarten teacher who was accused of molesting a child and any normal innocent person would be horrified by these falsie accusations. However, the man seemed little ruffled by it and was more interested in what others thought of him. Any normal person would go ballistic and even more so when the whole school and town turned against him without a single shred of evidence. I praised his son Marcus for what he should have done in the first place. However, I did give it a score of six because it does tackle a difficult subject where many people's emotions are tested."
173,The Hunt,8,10 October 2015,"Difficult, but fantastic movie","Wow, what a film. A psychological torture (in the good way). I'm not going to say a word about the subject, as it may be a spoiler (I knew nothing about the plot).Fantastic writing, direction and acting by the entire cast, especially Mads Mikkelsen. Very realistic film that shows how fast things can get out of hand because of rumors or because of investigating children incorrectly. This movie is a must-see together with the amazing documentary ""Capturing the Friedmans (2003)"" as it shows how it's possible that all the children had false memories.The movie reminded me a lot of Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs (1971)"" - they share a lot in common, in themes and situations."
174,The Hunt,7,21 June 2015,Good solid drama,"The subject matter is a difficult area and the film handles it extremely well. The drama centres on false allegations of child abuse and the impact this has on the central character.The acting is first rate particularly from the young girl at the centre of the drama. The events are carefully and subtly drawn and invite careful consideration of how those in a position of authority, but with no experience in the area, can investigate suspicions of inappropriate behaviour from one of their colleagues.Whilst the story is told very effectively it feels small and constrained in its scope. The emotional impact on this viewer was limited although it certainly gave pause for though and contemplation."
175,The Hunt,8,6 May 2015,Mads Mikkelsen is an eye-opener,"This. Is. Emotional. Thoughtful. Filmmaking. That's what it is, really. It's the kind of movie where you become fully engrossed in the drama, unaware of your own time and place. But what is it about, you might say. Well, it's about a man named Lucas who is wrongfully accused of child molestation. That's it, basically. That is the movie summed up in one sentence. But the real payoff lies in the great performances, particularly by Mads Mikkelsen who plays Lucas and the social questions the film implicitly raises. These can't be sensed by summarizing the plot, but arise naturally from the story as it develops.Mikkelsen was a real eye-opener for me. I had seen him in Casino Royale, playing the villain Le Chiffre, but his performance in Jagten is something else. His role is an emotional one, trying desperately to fix a situation spiraling out of his (and anyone else's) control, but his performance is more on the subtle side of things, never overacting. There's a scene where he asks his best friend Theo whether he believes that he could have molested his daughter, Klara. Much to Lucas's astonishment, Theo does not immediately reject the idea and you can see the slow realization in Mikkelsen's eyes that Theo thinks very differently of him now. The best actors act with their eyes.The film starts out slow, with many scenes setting the stage for what is to happen. Director Vinterberg allows us to first become acquainted with Lucas and his social circle, so that when 'the hunt' actually begins, the change is all the more visceral. Klara, the daughter of Lucas's best friend Theo, is quite attached to Lucas. He is there for her when her own parents are not. At one point she kisses him which he makes clear to her is not appropriate. In her frustration she lies to her kindergarten principal that Lucas touched her inappropriately. Soon the whole village knows and everyone rejects Lucas immediately, worried that he might go after their own children too. The entire film basically shows the consequences of this little lie and the impact it has on Lucas's life which I'll not talk about here. I was worried how such a film might end, but it definitely did not disappoint despite it being a rather open ending. It's an ending that's fully relevant to the film's theme and leaves one with a growing amount of questions regarding parenting, evidence versus hearsay, sons taking the blame for their father's (in this case supposed) sins, etc.Jagten reminds me in many ways of the witch hunt McCarthy conducted in the 1950's. The example of sons taking the blame for their father's sins reminds me of a case during the McCarthy hearings. Milo Radulovich, a lieutenant in the Air Force reserve, was discharged after his father and sister were accused of being communists. I'd like to end this review by quoting US senator John McLellan (yes, I had to look up the name) who made an important statement during the 1954 House Un-American Activities Committee hearing of Annie Lee Moss - the one where McCarthy famously left. After he left, his chief counsel Roy Cohn made a statement which McLellan then rebuked because he, Cohn, was merely alluding to evidence instead of presenting it. When senator Karl Mundt subsequently ordered what Cohn said to be stricken from the record, McLellan immediately emphasized the impossibility of such an action: ""You can't strike these statements made by counsel here as to evidence that we're having and withholding. You cannot strike that from the press nor from the public mind once it's planted there. That's the  that is the  evil of it. It is not sworn testimony. It is convicting people by rumor and hearsay and innuendo."""
176,The Hunt,9,30 April 2014,"A very nice film. Realistic, truthful, meaningful.","This is a film that surprised me in a good way.I honestly don't remember the last years seeing many films like it. Truthful, meaningful and realistic. Depicting a story that can happen to anyone of us, and not like the usual annoyingly distorted fairy tales of how the directors THINK the world is but rather as we live it (unlike von trier's nymphomaniac which i saw recently and just sighed for the time i wasted). I found myself in the end troubled, reconsidering some beliefs and a bit shocked in a good way though (more like alarmed and awakened i could call it). A good man,that loves his work as a nursery school teacher, lives in a small town and is divorced with a young son that lives with his mother. He works around children which he loves a lot that's why he became a teacher in the first place. But this parent-like love of his, is soon being misinterpreted for something dark and perverted due to a misunderstanding that started as a rumor which will prove though to be grave and destructive. He turns down the feelings of a little girl in the nursery school and she comes up with a story as a revenge, inspired by a porn pic she saw on her brother's PC. She says to the headmistress that he showed her his ""willie"" which was even ""pointy as a rod"" as she heard her brother's friend saying. The thought bothers like a splinter the headmistress's head for a day long till she finally decides to tell the event to the girl's mother and to the other parents of the kids. The rumor was presented in a relatively believable way so it consequently was established as a truth. His friends with whom he was drinking and laughing the other day now hate him and try to keep him away. At some point they even went so far as to attacking him and even killing his dog Fanny and leaving it in a garbage bag in front of his house. So we have a man's life being turned upside down in the blink of an eye by a little girl that wants to avenge him because he rejected her romantic feelings (as much serious as these can be for a 4 years old). It is an insightful journey on herd mentality, on unconscious malicious feelings manifesting even towards our once beloved people when circumstances permit it, and of the pathology and danger a child can bear despite the idealistic common belief that children are de facto sinless or ""can never lie"" as the headmistress says. As it is proved they can lie and not just lie but destroy someone's life in a single day. Added to their poor lack of judgment, ignorance of consequences, and poor memory as the case was in the specific story a ""little lie"" can be proved big enough to bring someone's life to ruins. I want to congratulate the director on this because for me it was the first time i saw this reality being brought to the light of cinema and be analyzed in it's defining components. The strength of friendship being tested to it's extremes as the girl's father happens to be the teacher's best friend among with other fathers. And the integrity and value of the modern societal ordinance of cities being questioned and exploited under the light of it's potential or maybe even innate pathogenies. Also the very important realization that teachers should keep that discreet ""healthy distance"" between them and the children, no matter their age, cause first it's the proper educational thing, and of course so that any possible misfortune would be avoided. A film that despite being a little slow paced got me hanging from my chair till the very end."
177,The Hunt,10,29 April 2014,This film will kick your a**,"Rape is one of the most sensitive subjects in human history and has been looked at as one of the most monstrous and horrifying crimes that has ever been instituted. The Hunt delves in almost every human emotion known and it knows how to stick a knife in your back and never let go. This film shows dehumanization as the public emotionally (and sometimes even physically) destroys a man played by Mads Mikkelsen. His character Lucas is accused of raping his best friends daughter and the film shows before hand that Lucas is a good man by subtle touches to his dialogue and his ability to deal with the situation even though it has become the worse case scenario. From the script, to the screenplay, and especially to the acting, this film has become cinema heaven and gives me chills that rattles me to the very core every time I watch it. Its almost a social experiment that expresses how low humans will go by hearing just a little white lie. If you watch this film, take a seat, get comfortable, and be ready to get your ass kicked."
178,The Hunt,8,29 April 2014,Profoundly Unsettling Portrait of Paranoia within an Isolated Community,"Other reviewers have commented very cogently on the film's thematic preoccupations with the ways in which allegations of pedophilia can ruin a person's life, even if they have not done anything. What is perhaps most noteworthy about Thomas Vinterberg's film is the way in which the story has been told: with no music to influence the viewers' attitude towards the characters, or set the mood for each sequence, we are left to make up our minds for ourselves. Charlotte Bruus Christensen's camera focuses relentlessly on the characters' expressions through tight close-ups: we see the way in which Lucas' (Mads Mikkelsen) life is ruined through the way in which he begins to look wildly about him, as if fearful of reprisal. The sequence taking place on Christmas Day where Lucas sits in a pew and looks behind him at his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) is particularly effective; through a series of shot/reverse shots, we see Theo's face becoming more and more anxious as he understands just how much mental strain Lucas undergoes. The sequence builds up to an uncomfortable climax as the two men are seen in two-shot, with Lucas grabbing Theo's lapels and shaking him. In the background, the carols sung by the infants' choir stop abruptly, and everyone stares at the two men. Vinterberg's film is intelligently set around the changing seasons, running from autumn to Christmas; as the festive season approaches, so life becomes more and more unbearable for Lucas: so much for the season of goodwill. The title is deliberately ambiguous: not only referring to the annual winter hunt - where all the menfolk gather in good-natured celebration of a time-honored ritual, but to the way Lucas is hunted by the rest of his community. We are left to reflect on the ways in which the menfolk seem blissfully unaware of this distinction, even a year after the pedophile incident has supposedly occurred. This oversight paves the way for a seriously uncomfortable ending during the annual deer hunt, where we learn the extent to which Lucas' life has been ruined. A profoundly unsettling piece, of especial significance today, when so many scandals involving alleged pedophiles seem to be coming to light,"
179,The Hunt,10,14 March 2014,About Torsten,"I just watched The Hunt which was newly released on Netflix. I am a great fan of Mads Mikkleson and watch his films and television work when I can find it. This film was excellent. I watched it as a horror film; uncomfortable, creepy, dark and scary. The character who made me feel most uncomfortable was Torsten who I feel is the real villain in this film. He allowed his sister to be subjected to pornography while his friend thought it was sooooo funny. Yes, peer pressure is a topic to discuss in his case, but really!! When he cried while watching Klara playing in the snow I thought his conscience is finally kicking in and he'll tell his parents about the pornography incident. Instead, he watches Marcus, Lucas and his parents continue to suffer. Torsten was not on the screen for a long period of time, but I think that during the time he was on he showed me enough to believe that he knew that what he did with his friend was the reason for his sister's trauma and the destruction of the life of his father's best friend."
180,The Hunt,9,8 March 2014,"One of the year's best, The Hunt is one movie you don't want to miss","Having never seen a Danish movie before, I didn't know what to expect going into this. Turns out, Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt is one of 2013's best movies, and you'll be missing out if you don't see it.Taking place in small town in Denmark, The Hunt tells a story of Lucas. A man working at a nursery who loves the kids and the kids love him. When one of the kids tell the staff that Lucas ""showed her his willie"", Lucas' life takes a turn for the worse as he is now a victim of witch-hunt from the town folk. In the midst of all that, he's trying to maintain his relationship with his son, who he's seeing less of ever since his divorce.All the actors deliver great performances throughout the movie. Lucas is played brilliantly by Mads Mikkelsen of Casino Royale and Valhalla Rising fame. Also starring are Alexandra Rapaport, Thomas Bo Larsen, and Annika Wedderkopp as Klara, the young girl who accuses Lucas.The movie's plot is a good one. It talks about one of the things I hate the most about people and the way they behave, and that's mob mentality. It's one of the most dangerous things human beings are capable of; and it shows here in The Hunt. Lucas' whole life got ruined because of a lie a kid said. No one has any evidence, they just choose to believe Klara because kids don't lie.You can understand though why some of the people in the town behaved in the way they did. Pedophilia is a disgusting, horrible thing. The people in this town are very close to each other. It's a really close-knit community; one that you'd expect would stand up for each other. So it's no surprise Lucas gets shunned by them. This is not the right thing to do but it does happen. And that realism adds to the affect that the movie has on you. It's scary to think that this something that could easily happen to any of us.Thomas Vinterberg did a good job in directing. There are some beautiful shots in the movie that show you what a pretty place it is. There's also some shots that are so intense that you almost fall off your seat. One of my favorite scenes is when the young girl is telling the staff ""what happened"" and you can almost see her thinking ""should I tell the truth or should I go on with this story!"" Another one takes place in a grocery market. Both those scenes are so rage inducing, and I mean that in a good way. Vinterberg is a very talented director and I'll be sure to check out more of his work.The Hunt is one of the scariest movies I've seen. With great acting, great story, great atmosphere, and a great ending; The Hunt is truly a great film, one that's definitely worth your time."
181,The Hunt,8,4 March 2014,Brilliant but chilling,"Jagten is an emotionally intense story. It will make you sick, angry, impatient, sorrowful, and paranoid about your own neighbors and friends. The story is so true but sad. People are so quick to rely on platitudes like ""children never lie"" or ""where there's smoke, there's fire."" As the parent of three children whom I raised alone after my wife died of cancer, I think that any parent who doesn't realize that their child lies is a very foolish parent indeed. Children have all the selfish, evil desires of adults, plus a much more vivid imagination. Children not only lie, they hate, and they are quick to hurt others when they don't get their own ways. Any parent who does not understand these basic truths is merely asking for their child to become a thoroughly horrible adult.The real sick one in this film is 5-year-old Klara's teen brother, who shows her a hard-core pornographic image on his iPad. Klara is understandably shocked and offended; a natural reaction. But later this brief, seemingly trivial incident becomes another reason for her to hate her teacher when he tries to put her straight about the childish crush she expresses for him through an impulsive kiss on the mouth and later on a romantic gift. Another platitude, ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"" does come into play when Klara becomes sullen and vengeful because of what she takes as a rejection. Her gentle, beloved kindergarten teacher suddenly becomes linked to her exposure to the pornographic image, and she blurts out her feelings in front of a foolish older teacher, who assumes the worst. This teacher brings in a superior administrator, who then really inflames the entire issue by dismissing any attempt by Klara to recant her imprudent outburst as psychological denial of abuse. This effectively seals the teacher's guilt in the eyes of all concerned.From here the story spirals out of control as the townsfolk express their hatred for the teacher in the most cowardly and brutal ways. The intensity comes to a head on Christmas Eve, when Klara finally gets her father to understand that her teacher is indeed innocent. The townsfolk generally realize their mistake and the teacher is exonerated and welcomed back into the community with apologies all around.Then the film cuts to a year later as the teacher's son, Marcus, has reached the age of his first deer hunt, a rite of passage into full manhood for this Danish community. While out on the hunt, an unidentified person tries to shoot the wrongly accused teacher from a distance, revealing that not everyone is convinced of his innocence and that he will never be able to feel safe or fully accepted in the community again after those false accusations.This is a powerful, excellently filmed drama that strikes deeply into the conscience of human society and the cowardly ways we tend to deal with fear, gossip, and rumor."
182,The Hunt,7,1 March 2014,At Close Range,"The Hunt (Jagten)This film is recommended.A teacher is falsely accused of sexual abuse. In The Hunt, we watch as mass hysteria infects a town and its people in this taut psychological thriller from Denmark. Director Thomas Vinterberg mined this type of scenario before with his earlier film, The Celebration, a film exploring incest and family dysfunction. In this film, he examines the repercussions of half truths and lies on an innocent man who slowly comes to grips with this accusation and its ripple effect with family and friends.Films like The Children's Hour, The Crucible, Doubt, and Prisoners, have laid the groundwork for this genre of film. Vinterberg, along with his co-writer Mogens Rukov, have successfully fashioned a screenplay that never clearly states the obvious and allows the moviegoer the ability to interpret the story on various intellectual and emotional levels. The subject matter is skillfully handled, but as written, the main character takes on heroic status. The accused shows far too much quiet dignity and reserve when anger and rage should really surface. The initial reactions of this man seem atypical and totally out of kilter. The town's reaction emphasizes the mania which overtakes the community. One can only accept this collective response as human nature at its worse. But even Lucas' reactions when accused of this heinous act appear unnatural and do not seem logical or remotely real. But it is Mads Mikkelsen as Lucas, the accused predator who delivers a multi-faceted performance. He imbues his role as the common man helplessly placed on this precarious path. With an inner grace and a subtle vulnerability, the actor allows his character to feel the pain and anxiety of a man on the edge of a breakdown as the situation escalates. One can easily relate to this main character and personalizes his traumatic circumstance due to Mikkelsen's powerful portrayal. Yet, the townsfolk in the film seems to live in a moral vacuum. The investigation of this crime by the police are an afterthought and the legalities with the criminal justice system are strangely downplayed. There is no lawyer for hire, a glaring oversight in the script. Reality tends to weave in and out of the plot. The film veers into pure melodrama in the last section of the film. Especially unsatisfying is the film's conclusion, one that never completely fulfills its carefully-plotted story points and its well-drawn characters.All in all, The Hunt is a gripping drama that engages its movie-going audience. The director has created many tense moments and establishes a wonderful relationship between Mikkelsen and the two young actors with whom he interacts: the sweet Annika Wedderkopp as Kiara, the confused child who sets all the insinuations into motion, and Lasse Fogelstrom as Lucas' loyal son. They are the key to the film's emotional center and allow the insightful storytelling of The Hunt to take direct aim at its compelling topic.

183,The Hunt,8,25 February 2014,"""I can see it in his face""","THE HUNT never leaves its Smaller Town, Denmark, setting; it doesn't have many big dramatic twists and turns beyond those described in the premise-synopsis; and it shows little or nothing of things that would be crucial in most big Hollywood productions: police interrogations, hearings, news flashes, interviews with the other children besides the original ""accuser"" and what they (supposedly) said. Nevertheless, there is an immediate realism here, with excellent dialogue and interactions of all kinds by ordinary people, that more than compensates if you do not absolutely require big-film elements. THE HUNT also makes fine use of nuances of mannerism and subtle everyday symbolism. Some great scenery too.Excellent character development and fine acting, especially by Mads Mikkelsen (who co-starred in another excellent Danish film, A ROYAL AFFAIR), Annika Wederkopp, and all the actors who play the various other children. THE HUNT simply and straightforwardly shows how this sort of random ""accusation,"" embellished and escalated by adults, can irrevocably ruin any of us, including the very best of us. Yet, it also shows the other perspective: How, even when there is no solid evidence and tons of reasonable doubt, Lucas's former closest friends will never be able to entirely discount the possibility of some truth somewhere to the allegation, especially when it involves their own children. Moreover, those without involvement or first-hand knowledge of the case (the local grocery store staff, etc) are eager to jump on the sanctimonious bandwagon and get in their chops. Finally, it's very revealing of how the biggest, most horrible mistakes and misjudgments are the hardest to admit or correct.Throughout this film, the first thought in my mind was simply ""This is exactly how such a non-incident would occur, as well as what might very well happen afterward."""
184,The Hunt,10,22 February 2014,One of those movies you will never forget,"Well, I saw this movie something like 1 year ago. I did not expect anything great from this movie, yet - well, nothing much to say here. This is one of those movies you will remember for life. This is one of those movies (for me one of the very very few) when you want to SCREAM in the cinema, you want to tell THEM, there in the very movie on the screen - DO something, or Don't do it, or whatever is right. You feel like you should be inside and do something! I almost jumped out of my chair few times, with anger, emotions.If your soul longs for real good life, if you long for justice, if you try to be better person and fight every day for something good in your life - this is movie for you. This movie is not about pedophilia of course - it is about how we hurt and kill our brothers and sisters every day, how we judge and throw people out from our lives just because they were supposedly ""guilty"" of something. Movie about compassion and understanding - no, not about terrible crime which pedophilia of course is, but about daily crimes of our lives, about our attempt to understand other man. Deeply touching movie. 10/10 from me, a rare note as I find most contemporary cinema very superficial. This is not the case for sure."
185,The Hunt,8,5 February 2014,"Smart, haunting drama with Mikkelsen on particularly fine form as a man trapped in the crosshairs of a community gone hysterical.","Anyone familiar with Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen's filmography  including his current stint on NBC's serial-killer drama Hannibal  would expect him to play a certain kind of role in a certain kind of film. With his stone-carved features, heavy-set eyes and convenient European accent, Mikkelsen makes for a great villain. Small wonder, then, that Hollywood has tossed him many a generic part in this vein, beginning with the bizarrely sinister Le Chiffre in Bond reboot Casino Royale.It's actually a downright shame because Mikkelsen is an actor with a tremendous capacity for subtlety, depth and tenderness, something he demonstrates regularly in thoughtful home-grown dramas like A Royal Affair. He gets the chance to explore his gentler side again in The Hunt, an intelligent, quietly heartbreaking look at how a man can be brought to his knees by a tiny lie that spins completely out of control.Jolly, genial Lucas (Mikkelsen) is well entrenched in his local community: he's got a regular group of drinking buddies, and he loves the kids he works with in his capacity as a teacher at a local kindergarten. His friends and his work barely make up for the fact that he's going through an acrimonious divorce and sorely misses his beloved son Marcus (Lasse Fogelstrøm). But, just as his romantic prospects seem to be picking up again, Klara (Annika Wedderkopp)  a sweet, lonely little girl he walks to and from school when her squabbling parents (who also happen to be his best friends) forget about her  lets slip to the school principal that Lucas did something quite unforgivable to her.Writer-director Thomas Vinterberg took inspiration for The Hunt from the mass hysteria that characterised the Salem witch trials of the late 1600s  an instance when paranoia, doubt and the mob mentality brewed into a fatal stew that cost the lives of many innocent women. He isolates Lucas very effectively here, as friends with whom he has skinny-dipped and got drunk quite literally turn their backs on him, the amity in their eyes replaced by hatred and disdain.The Hunt is not an easy watch because Vinterberg makes it feel startlingly, worryingly real  in fact, the world into which Lucas is rudely plunged feels so plausible that it's easy to imagine it happening to someone in your own community. There are no big lies, elaborate ruses or grand gestures, just children lying too easily and parents trusting them too willingly. What's even more devastating is that, except for a couple of particularly close-minded idiots, it's hard to fault the characters in the film for distancing themselves from Lucas. What's tragic is that, if there's even an inkling of truth to what Klara says about him, their attitudes and responses make sense. Mikkelsen, so often typecast as the hunter in his Hollywood outings, makes for a convincingly haunted victim here. A lesser actor would have played Lucas as a thoroughly passive character reeling in bewilderment as friends and fortune desert him. But Mikkelsen lends Lucas a strength and weight that makes him recognisably real. Most memorably, he skilfully underplays an explosive confrontation in the local supermarket, allowing Lucas to emerge from the fracas with his dignity intact.If The Hunt takes a while to get to its point, it can be forgiven in view of the chilling insights it provides into human nature and psychology. It's all the more horrifying and powerful when you realise that it could just as easily be a documentary as a cautionary tale  in a close-knit community, a tiny lie could be every bit as damaging as actual proof of wrongdoing."
186,The Hunt,9,27 January 2014,A very moving and controversial subject line which will keep you thinking about the issue and society norms for a long time after the movie ends,"The movie comes from the director of The Celebration (Festen - 1998). A very simple and moving story of a kinder garden teacher in a small village. The movie was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards and Golden Globe Award 2013Plot :A recently divorced kinder garden teacher Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen - Casino Royal Fame) is struggling to come in terms with the divorce and is trying to buy in more time from his wife to spend with his son. Meanwhile he enjoys spending time with the kids in the kinder garden and the children are very much attached to him. A particular kid Klara, daughter of his close friend is disturbed and feels lonely due to her parents constant quarrels and gets to like Lucas more due to his affectionate behavior. But what does a small child know?, she shows her affection by giving him a heart shaped toy and kisses him for which Lucas scolds her and says this is inappropriate and should be done only with parents. The kid gets emotionally hurt and from her imagination and stuff heard from her brother says terrible a lie against Lucas to the kinder garden's caretaker. A child abuse blame gets put on the already struggling Lucas and how he proves himself innocent and how people behave with him and what happens to his life both personal and professional after the blame is being put is what the film is all about.A very mature, bold and a strong story line with incredible acting from Mads Mikkelsen and Annika Wedderkopp(The kid). A deep and real life reaction is captured of how people attitude changes once a person is blamed against. Even the closest friend suddenly changes into your worst foe. Even after proved innocent a person who is blamed is always seen by the society with a cruel eye and he can never return 100% back to his old good terms, there is always an uneasiness in the eyes of the people. The hunter (Lucas hunts deer during hunting season) becomes hunted once he's falsely accused. The director wants to convey that almost all of us believe that kids never lie, but sadly the truth is that they have a lot of imagination and often lie.Verdict :A very moving and controversial subject line which will keep you thinking about the issue and society norms for a long time after the movie ends. 9/10 :)"
187,The Hunt,9,25 January 2014,An Innocent Man,"THE HUNT (dir. Thomas Vinterberg) Few offenses are so horrific that even the accusation of wrongdoing can destroy your life, yet Danish superstar, Mads Mikkelsen, stars in a brutally dramatic film about just such a crime. Mikkelsen plays a popular and much beloved kindergarten teacher assistant who is wrongfully accused of inappropriate sexual behavior with one of his students. The film shows how the confused statements by a five year old girl (who happens to be the daughter of his best friend), start a diabolical chain of events that turn the entire town against him, and escalate into a contemporary witch hunt. Mads Mikkelsen delivers an Academy Award winning performance in a film that will have you squirming in your seat rooting for an innocent man. Nominated for Best Foreign Film in the 2014 Academy Awards. ABSOLUTE MUST SEE"
188,The Hunt,8,16 January 2014,"The world is full of evil but if we hold on to each other, it goes away.","Haven't we heard all this before, especially when some half-backed therapist starts using unproven therapies. A man is accused of child abuse on the flimsiest of ""evidence"" and everyone assumes he is guilty.Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a kindergarten teacher who is accused after a little girl, Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), feels rebuffed by him. The girl's statement was blown all out of proportion by the principal (Susse Wold), who spread it all over town before any steps were taken to investigate.It is difficult to watch how easily the bonds of trust and friendship are shattered after a sexual abuse accusation is set in motion. The ending wasn't as bad as I had anticipated, but it was still a kick in the gut."
189,The Hunt,10,12 January 2014,wow,"I will take off my Danish glasses and look at this movie as a person from any other country. I thought this movie was amazing, it was obvious that Thomas Vinterberg really thought this through. The acting is great, Mads Mikkelsen (Lucas) does a wonderful job playing this down to earth guy, who could not in his wildest imagination do anything cruel to a little girl. Thomas Bo (Theo) did a good job too, he is great playing this kind of person who drinks a lot of beers and smoke a ton of cigarettes, this role might be easier to relate to if you are a Dane, because we got a lot of these kind of people in Denmark. I think this movie makes you think a lot about how a little lie can effect a normal guy like Lucas. I also thought a lot about how i would react in Lucas and Theo's situation, because it must be tough. I apologize for spelling or grammatic errors, i will try to get better in future reviews. Last thing is: I can't believe this didn't win a Golden Globe."
190,The Hunt,9,8 January 2014,"Sophisticated society, Primitive reactions","Firstly I have to say that I am a fan of Mads Mikkelsen and since the film is mainly based on his performance I do like it a lot. So by leaving his great performance apart, so that you will not be forced to read about how amazing his face, voice and interpretation are, I would like to focus on the feeling I had after watching the movie.One of the elements that I mostly appreciated was the fact that the audience knows the truth from the beginning and every human reaction and event is judged upon that.Even though we are living in a time of civilized society, when our greatest worries in life are not related to survival issues as they were in the stone age, we react in the same primitive way when we feel threatened. It looks even worse now, because nowadays since the society is civilized we are forced to refrain our reactions and try to justify the violence we use by hiding under the veil of the common sense. I had the feeling we are still living in a primitive way and have found new ways and words to manipulate the truth so we can give to it the meaning we want."
191,The Hunt,9,27 December 2013,Heartbreaking but also masterfully made.,"'THE HUNT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A Danish film about a kindergarten employee who's wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a young girl, at the school he works at, due to a misunderstanding. The movie stars Mads Mikkelsen and was directed by Thomas Vinterberg. Vinterberg also wrote the screenplay, with Tobias Lindholm, and co-produced the movie as well. It was submitted as the Danish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at 2014's upcoming Academy Awards. The film is of course really hard to watch and heartbreaking but also masterfully made.Mikkelsen plays Lucas, a kindergarten staff member who lives in a small Danish town. He's divorced and trying to keep a relationship with his son but his ex-wife makes that very difficult for him. Lucas has recently became romantically involved with a co-worker, Nadja (Alexandra Rapaport), and has won a battle with his ex to have his son come stay with him. All that is threatened when a young girl at the school, Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), says something in anger about Lucas, due to him rejecting a present she gave him, and a teacher interprets what she said as an indication of sexual abuse. Even when Klara says Lucas didn't actually do anything her teacher and mother (Anne Louise Hassing) think she's just in denial. Lucas is labeled a sexual predator by the community and is totally rejected by them, which causes more difficulties in his relationships with his son, Nadja and his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), who is Klara's father.The movie is of course depressing and extremely disturbing and it doesn't really have a happy ending either. Subject matter like this is really difficult to discuss and cover in a film, which is what's most impressive about this movie; how bold the filmmakers were for taking it on and how effective they are dealing with it. It's so painful to watch because it is very realistic and masterfully conveys a slice of real life. The directing is brilliant, the script was extremely well thought out and Mikkelsen's performance is amazing (once again). Definitely a movie everyone should see and I hope it gets that Oscar nomination.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYWAOd_o4Sk"
192,The Hunt,10,30 December 2013,"'The world is full of evil but if we hold n to each other, it goes away.'","THE HUNT as directed by Thomas Vinterberg (The Celebration) is a profoundly moving film that should be seen by everyone. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, the film takes a brave stand on the current obsession with pedophilia, demonstrating that at times the accusing children are the true criminals when the stories are fabricated by the 'abused ones'. One of the reasons this film is so powerful is the extraordinary acting by Mads Mikkelsen who offers one of the most impressive performances on film.Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a 42 year- old teacher whose life has recently been bruised by divorce and the loss of custody of his son. He has found work in a very small Danish town as a teacher of kindergarten where his students and faculty and parents love him for his kindness and his exceptional skills in dealing with children. He meets an eligible girl Nadja (Alexandra Rappaport) who is eager to establish a relationship with him, and finally his ex- wife is allowing his son to come live with him. But everything about his life becomes a nightmare when one of his pupils Klara (Annika Wedderkoop), the young daughter of his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), who adores Lucas suddenly turns on him, creating a lie she shares with the school principal Grethe (Susse Wold). Grethe 'believes children' and Lucas is cast out of the community as a pedophile. Even Theo refuses to hear Lucas' denial about the lie as well as the folk in the little church in the town. The degree of agony one child's lie creates in the life of the innocent Lucas is almost unbearable to observe. Throughout the story and the film Mads Mikkelsen delivers a highly nuanced performance, one that will remain indelibly imprinted on viewers' minds  hopefully. This is a brilliant little film. In Danish and English with subtitles. Grady Harp"
193,The Hunt,8,14 December 2013,Very powerful film that exposes human flaws,"This is a very powerful film that you need to watch. Set in a Danish country where everyone knows everyone else, we are introduced to a very likable kindergarten teacher. This Danish setting delightful and it feels like you are truly immersed in a different world. Soon thereafter, a lie is told and this teacher's world spirals out of control.What is great about this movie is it shows the power of ""groupthink"" and how people can jump to conclusions when they are in an emotional state. Further, the ending is also great and very symbolic, as it shows that even once the truth is out, people are still scarred and can never truly escape a horrible lie."
194,The Hunt,8,12 December 2013,An engrossing nightmare.,"Back in 1998, Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg shook up the cinematic establishment with ""The Celebration,"" a devastatingly powerful debut which explores shocking revelations and the power of a lie, and the incalculable, irreparable damage it can cause. Fourteen years later, Vinterberg returns with ""The Hunt,"" which shares many similarities with its celebrated predecessor, and it has received high praise at both the Cannes and London film festivals. ""The Hunt,"" a Palme d'Or nominee, revisits familiar ground, where Vinterberg continues to fan the flames of social unrest in a far more conventional manner.Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a kindergarten teacher in a small, hunting village in Denmark, who is recovering from a painful divorce and working to receive greater custody of his teenage son. He is best friends with the couple that lives next door, Theo and Agnes (Larsen and Hassing), and has a fond relationship with their daughter Klara (Wedderkopp), who is also one of his young pupils. One day, the young girl says some odd things which imply that Lucas is a sexual predator. Suddenly, the town closes ranks against him, and everyone assumes that children don't lie about such things. Klara, though she tries, is unable to take back her words.It's a childlike act of revenge orchestrated by a little girl who doesn't know any better, and who is trying to avoid further embarrassment or torment. However, the narrative of the story is driven by the adults of this small town. Quickly shunned by a community that once welcomed him, Lucas is left to absorb the nightmare alone, finding even his closest companions unsure of his innocence.Vinterberg maintains a human focus to the story, emphasizing strained relationships and universal suspicion, while capturing the essence of despair as the characters struggle to make sense out of a confusing and volatile situation. ""The Hunt"" is unsettling and enraging to watch because of Lindholm's forceful script and the incredibly vivid performances, most notably Mikkelsen's sensational performance as the condemned man. The film's premise isn't anything particularly new, however, Mikkelsen's powerful performance creates a strong sense of empathy for Lucas which transcends this engrossing nightmare, where simply surviving doesn't mean your days as a target are over."
195,The Hunt,8,26 November 2013,THE HUNT for the best foreign movie in 2013 is over,"Heard from my colleagues that children these days are too smart and they sing, dance just like the elders. Few are matured in other ways. Matured enough to even lie about you. Yes, they do. This movie contradicts the evident truth that ""Kids don't lie"". The story is very original and screenplay is first-rate. Mads Mikkelson (the guy who played villain in Casino Royale) is the central character in this movie gave a mind-blowing show. All other actors were fine and the child 'Klara' was unforgettable. Music is ultra-reduced but I'd say it is for good. The major demerit is in the second-half where the adult members of the village misbehave with the hero (imo, its too unreal, extreme and hyped) in various scenes. But this demerit gets overshadowed by its list of positives mentioned above. The bottom line : the movie is one of the strongest contenders for the academy.My thoughts after watching this -- ""Well at least now let me be careful handling kids""."
196,The Hunt,8,23 November 2013,An important and powerful film,"After garnering attention and acclaim from critics and art-house fans alike with his debut Festen (1998), things didn't pan out for Danish director Thomas Vinterberg as most people expected. He had a number of flops that passed by without anyone taking notice, and it seemed like the co-founder of the Dogme 95 movement was destined to be a one hit wonder. However, he hit back in 2012 with Jagten, or The Hunt, a powerful study of hysteria in a small town that was nominated for the Palme d'Or and took home Best Actor for lead Mads Mikkelsen.It tells the story of teacher-by-trade Lucas (Mikkelsen) who is working for a local kindergarten school after the closure of his school. He is a quiet, lonely man living in the house he once lived in with his wife and son. He has his close friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), the father of Klara (Annika Wedderkopp) who is in Lucas's kindergarten group, and the two regularly go on hunting expeditions with a circle of heavy-drinking friends. Things are looking good for Lucas when he begins to date co- worker Nadja (Alexandra Rapaport), until the confused Klara tells another teacher that Lucas exposed himself to her and possibly molested her.To avoid falling into the did-he-or-didn't-he category, Vinterberg wisely cements Lucas's innocence from the off, making The Hunt less a thriller and more of a serious study of small-town mentality and the rapid spread of mass hysteria. People whom Lucas once shared drinks with as friends quickly turn a simple, albeit dangerous, lie, into paranoid and sheer panic. Pamphlets are handed out to parents detailing signs of sexual abuse - nightmares, crying - things you would generally expect children to do anyway, but when faced with leading questions, the children are understandably confused about the facts and are willing to go with what their parents obviously believe.Nobody seems to confront the fact that sometimes children lie, and even when Lucas's case is dismissed by police due to an overwhelming lack of evidence, he is still a predatory paedophile in other people's eyes and is isolated by the townsfolk. Mikkelsen, who will be familiar to most English-speaking audiences as the bad guy from Casino Royale (2006) and as Hannibal Lecter in the TV series Hannibal, gives an excellent, nuanced performance, who is at first confused and outraged, and later full of anger and contempt. This is very much an actor's film, with Vinterberg using a calm, hand-held camera to avoid intruding on the story. This film will leave you uncomfortable and frustrated, no doubt, but this is an important and powerful film about the dangers of witch- hunt mentality and condemning people as guilty until proved innocent.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
197,The Hunt,9,28 October 2013,So Original. ♦ 91%,"When innocence and imagination couple up, they create a horrendous effect and this time it is a lonely Kindergarten teacher, who's the victim. Of course, on reel.The horrifying tale starts so calm, we believe it is simple drama. 20 minutes into the wonderful screenplay, we get a punch of hearty emotion, then comes anxiety, apprehension, sympathy, anger and finally, vindictiveness. Now, the whole setup & focus on the details is marvelous where when a deer falls on the ground after being shot on the neck, the dust particles that be caused by its thud on the ground is explicit. And when 5-6 year old kids acts like thespians, you can only imagine how cool the experience for a viewer would be. That girl who played Klara is fantastic, with an idiosyncratic, spasmodic-like expression; not to mention, which is also evident, Mads Mikkelsen is terrific, poignant & apt!Music is calm, so are the dialogs. The turn of events is a result of beautiful writing and Thomas Vinterberg has made ""this hunt"" a remarkable watch. The characters are well-written and with a tick of good cinematography & use of realism than fiction, Jagten aka The Hunt is a 9 pointer.One thing, the ending is kinda ambiguous and required me to use Wikipedia.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended! I kept thinking about the paranoid world who so easily dub men as monsters without thinking or even considering. There's no one to blame, but this one sets a code, all right! Wonderful film-making!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO (But, should!)Profanity: Mediocre | Sex/Nudity/Vulgarity: Very Strong | Porn: Mediocre | Violence/Gore: Strong | Alcohol: Very Strong | Smoking: Mild | Drugs: No"
198,The Hunt,10,25 May 2013,The innocence,"The film as a story is rather simple: a man is mistaken accused of abusing a girl. In a small community it provokes panic, hostility and violence. We tend to lean on the stereotypes we know when the situation is unclear and the feelings (it is a small community and all people seem to know very well each other) get in the way. Everyone who has a child knows that children lie all the time, but we cannot believe that a child could lie of being abused. Certainly in an age that the idea of ​​sexuality is not fully developed. Maybe in now days, children have more images about that but the idea of ​​a child who is willing to hurt someone no matter what, remains appalling. It is not the first time that en ""evil"" child come as an example, but in this case i would not say that Klara intended to do any harm. It is a kid like all the other kids and she is upset with her teacher. She tells a few lines from a porn movie she heard. The teacher is alarmed, but who wouldn't be? It is rather interesting that Klara knows the impact of her saying. She is innocent but not as much as someone might think. On the other hand, a man who is being wronged is struggling to prove his own innocence. It can happen and if so it would be like this. And when children are involved, even though the man is not guilty, if you are not someone watching the film, a little ""god"" who is aware of all the truths, how can you say that a tiny part of you stays with a doubt ; Great film!!"
199,The Hunt,8,5 May 2013,"not an easy film to sit through, but it is a rewarding experience","The Hunt is a powerful, disturbing and provocative Danish drama about an innocent man who becomes the victim of a terrifying witch hunt that destroys his life and reputation in a small town. Lucas (played by Mads Mikkelsen) is an out of work teacher helping out at the local kindergarten. He is popular amongst the kids and the other staff. He also enjoys socialising with his closest friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) and drinking with his friends and even hunting deer with them. But that all changes when, in a fit of jealousy, Theo's six-year-old daughter Klara (Annika Wedderkopp) says something that leads both her parents and the school headmistress to accuse him of acting inappropriately towards her. And we the audience are helpless, and we squirm in out seats uncomfortably as we watch him become persecuted by his friends and former colleagues. The film has elements of Arthur Miller's classic The Crucible as it explores the damage done by innuendo as malicious gossip and rumours become truth, and a collective state of hysteria takes hold on the tight knit community. Lucas's sense of angst and injustice is palpable. There is a horrific scene in a supermarket, when the owner and a clerk savagely attack Lucas while he is doing his shopping, and this is hard to watch because of its brutality. But the damage is done, and even is unable to change the course of events, as no-one will believe her when she finally admits the truth. The Hunt is the new feature film from Thomas Vinterberg. Along with Danish director Lars Von Trier Vinterberg is one of the founders of the Dogma movement, which says that filmmakers must use natural lighting, no external music, and all action must serve the story. His film Festen (or The Celebration) was made under that manifesto. But he has torn up the rule book here, and The Hunt is all the better for it. His direction is restrained here. The film has been beautifully shot by cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen. And Vinterberg draws a career best performance from Mikkelsen, who played the villain in the Bond movie Casino Royale. He can currently be seen as a younger incarnation of psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter in the new TV series Hannibal. Mikkelsen normally has an intense and imposing physical presence on the screen. However here he is more restrained and delivers a subtle, nuanced performance that plays up his vulnerabilities and helplessness. Lucas is presented as a sympathetic figure whose life has already suffered enough blows - he is bitterly divorced from his wife and has a troubled relationship with his estranged teenage son. His mesmerising performance of quietly seething rage thoroughly deserved the best actor award he received at Cannes last year. And in her first film newcomer Wedderkop is frighteningly assured in a terrifyingly realistic performance as the malicious little girl whose accusation starts the chain of events that destroy Lucas's life. However, there is a slight misstep towards the end, although it is difficult to decide just how Vinterberg and his co-writer Tobias Lindholm could have satisfactorily resolved the festering atmosphere of suspicion and distrust that they have created. I caught this film at the Melbourne International Film Festival last year, and it left an impression that is hard to forget. The Hunt is not an easy film to sit through, but it is a rewarding experience for those who make the effort."
200,The Hunt,1,26 May 2014,"Story, if it is real or not, is beginning badly and it is going on awfully.","Lucas's crimeThe Hunt (Jagten) is based on true story, I know. Thomas Vinterberg is director with Lars Von Trier and their movies should be the most discussed. Because they know well receiving many people's interest, using people's expand who wanna discuss free some strange issues. In the Hunt, we have a basic problem. Lucas, a teacher, kissed by little girl student, is he a real man, sure? Lucas's reflection of little girl is stupid. If he is a really teacher he would know this kiss isn't a problem. He mustn't offer she to kiss boys who in her age. He mustn't do anything. Every little child kiss adults, that is related with their oral growing. A teacher doesn't know, doesn't know?Story, if it is real or not, is beginning badly and it is going on awfully. I don't believe Scandinavia society is so undeveloped. Child character is like a bad-evil role in a horror movie, the doubt which is circled in society can't be stopped, Mads Mikkelsen is a good actor etc. These aren't important. This movie is a bad movie. But if teacher's reflection has been discussed during movie it was OK. When a child kissed you don't get angry with him or her."
201,The Hunt,8,24 February 2013,"Jagten is a very good movie, though it really lacks something to be called a masterpiece.","Jagten is a very good movie, though it really lacks something to be called a masterpiece.I'd like to start with the flaws, which are mostly connected with the artistic devices used. I'll try to list them: 1) the comparisons between animal hunt by man and man ""hunt"" by man, IMO, is rather trivial and not that appropriate, given that from the ancient times people primarily hunt to get food and clothing. Surely, with the passage of years this activity has gained some sporting interest to it, but how many hunters do rape or violate their animal victims? And in this film ""hunt"" stands for hounding and revenge - two primal and eternal human desires. It is clear that the story had to present some additional themes, but for me all of those scenes of hunting in the forest were of no special interest; 2) the other flaw is connected with the use (or rather misuse) of lighting - most of the action is simply shrouded in darkness. I can agree that in some of the scenes this trick works perfectly well (e.g., that key episode when Clara tells her educator about that ill-fated story), but overall it simply prevents from the adequate perception of the film; 3) also, I just didn't like that ending, it seemed quite unnecessary and pointless. Wiki says that Vinterberg had been looking for the right ending for quite a long time - well, now we can see the result.Now, for the good sides. They surely include the acting and the great pace of the film - take at least the powerful segment where Lucas is taken to a police station and we see the life of his 14-year-old son in this rabid society of a small Danish town. But first and foremost, the film deserves praise for raising this urgent and difficult topic of pedophilia accusations. While watching Jagten (what an excellent-sounding word!) I was constantly thinking about possible outcomes of the same story in different societies. Somewhere in Pakistan Mikkelsen's character would have been simply killed by an angry mob, and the movie would have ended at the fifteenth minute. Or even at the burnt pavilions of a film set. Here in Russia a similar case is likely to be brought to the end and poor Lucas would've been imprisoned for at least 5 years. And in Jagten we can see the present day situation in Western Europe, where apparently the slightest suspicion in pedophilia can simply ruin a man's life. ""Children do not lie, they simply do not"" - and you just can't change it, even with hundreds of evidence of being not guilty at all. And then there follows a string of coward and accusatory glances of your friends and colleagues, which gradually turn into dead pets of yours and supermarket scum, who is ready to kill you at any time of day. And you're a lucky man if you end like Lukas does in Jagten. So, kudos once again to the Danish director for making the film built around such a complex topic.In the end I only want to note that, despite its disturbing storyline and a number of gory moments, this picture of Vinterberg's does not seem to be pessimistic or depressing, it's quite far from the murkiness of, for example, such Hitchcock's masterpiece as ""The Wrong Man"". Mikkelsen's character here surely has a guardian angel rescuing him from all of the troubles. Such happy ends do rarely occur in our life, let us admit it fairly. Almost as rare as a new My Bloody Valentine album. To sum it up, the film is very good, but, damn, it REALLY could have been better."
202,The Hunt,2,10 March 2017,Soooo predictable,"I rarely comment on movies because I don't usually think I can bring anything that hasn't been said before. But I just read a bunch of reviews and nobody mentions how predictable this movie is. From the very beginning I kept thinking: ""oh, this is going to happen now"", and then it did. After cycling this a good 5 or 10 times, I gave up on the movie after 40 minutes (less than halfway). Sorry, but after living through Outreau, there's nothing new that this movie bring to the table and its sheer predictability is its downfall."
203,The Hunt,7,5 September 2013,Bor-ring,"This is a good movie in many respects, good acting, good at building atmosphere, it has pathos.But in the end it left me feeling unsatisfied. The movie is sooo slow. There was not enough going on in the plot, and the ending is depressing and open-ended.The movie, while moving at some points, was not enjoyable to watch overall. It's like coming home for Thanksgiving dinner and all your family members that you avoid the rest of the year are there, and you spend the evening continually wincing at how horrible human interactions can be. And we're so helpless to do much about it, and often it's not really anyone's fault really. This movie is about how legitimate fears and mysteries can turn well-meaning people against one another. It's scary and sad in a creeping, enervating way."
204,The Hunt,7,17 May 2015,Rudimentary Treatment Of A Serious Topic,"Schoolteacher Lucas lives in a small Danish town . Things are going well . He enjoys his job and has a first date with his colleague Nadja but his whole world is about to change for the worse when he's accused of sexually abusing one of his young pupils I'm often in a hurry to state that Britain has a monopoly on a dramatic sub-genre called ""grief porn"" where film makers try and make the most bleak and depressing film in recorded history . I'm being slightly forgetful because Denmark also contributes to grief porn . I do remember seeing a few Danish shorts and can't think of a single feel good moment in any of them . The country of origin should have warned me as to what THE HUNT was about but it was the casting of Mads Mikkelsen who caught my eye , one of the most consistent actors I've seen in the last few years who brings an unearthly and intense quality to his roles I wondered how he might play for what is to all intents and purposes an everyman role To be fair it's not a bad performance but any actor capable of giving subtle nuance could have played the role of Lucas who finds himself being ostracised by his community when he becomes a suspected child abuser . Early in the story it's revealed that his so called victim Klara has been lying and so there's no ambiguity to the story except for the title that can be interpreted as THE HUNT as in the characters hunting deer in their spare time or THE HUNT as in witch hunt . It does have a human topicality as in if you let small minded genies out of bottles it's very difficult to put them back as more than a few British celebrities can tell you , of listening to self styled experts and of giving in to mob mentality . Despite all this the story itself is fairly basic and rudimentary and I did find myself expecting a bit more from the film"
205,The Hunt,7,3 April 2015,"Moving, slow story","Mads Mikkelsen does a great job in this movie. Featuring a teacher whose life gets suddenly ruined, he manages to transmit the feelings of somebody who has lost it all.The movie is about a kindergarten teacher that suddenly sees himself involved in a child abuse scandal after his best friend's daughter says she saw his private parts. Dealing with a very sensitive topic, the movie manages to portray on one side the importance of the issue, together with all the prejudices and violence that imply living in a small town where everyone gossips and nobody is inclined to consider Lucas' innocence.The ending is somewhat disappointing, and many things are left unexplained. In that sense the story is very catchy, but doesn't quite deliver the public's expectations. The last scene tries to sum it all up, and it is indeed quite shocking, yet when the credits come one has the feeling of ""what? but, what about this and that?"".I still recommend the movie. It is beautifully shot, very human, and it's nice to see from time to time a film that is far away from the shining Hollywood style."
206,The Hunt,7,26 January 2014,A Scary Prospect: The Hunt,"The Hunt lays out a very surreal scenario in which Lucas, a charismatic Kindergarten teacher, is accused of showing his private parts to one of the students. We know the whole time though that Lucas is innocent and that the accusation is not just a misunderstanding but a wildly out of control fire that is getting worse with every minute that passes. The administrator Gretthe (sounds like Greta) who first heard these accusations from the six year old Klara, leads the initial investigation in the worst way possible, putting more ideas in the girl's head than she should have, and bringing in unequipped, incompetent administrators who force even more heinous ideas into the girl's head by suggesting them in the first place and then burdening her to say yes because they believe she is forcing herself to forget. Without spoiling everything, I can say that the ending was somewhat satisfying because the psychological turns that Lucas goes through as a character, though lacking development, is sickening and terrifying. He doesn't evolve as much as he survives the investigation and gets to a point, after all the threats against his life, where he stares down his antagonists. It's worth watching to see just if he survives all the angry parents. One of the central strengths of the movie is the believability of the mob mentality, and it most certainly is believable here. But the one, single most frustrating aspect of the film is Lucas's inability to deny anything. He never once says, ""I didn't do this!"" Or ""I couldn't do this!"" It's amazingly irritating because all it shows us is how fantastically fragile his ego is. Not even during the first confrontation does Lucas tell Gretthe that he didn't do it. He shows little worry over the truthfulness and looks guilty. It's scary. I would believe he did it just by that alone if I weren't the viewer!But there are so many other great aspects like the acting. Madds Mikkelson is devastating. The actors who play his son, Marcus, and his accuser, Klara, are phenomenal. The characters themselves are somewhat typical, but they show complexity when necessary. Klara for instance is a girl in a neglectful home; someone who isn't in the best environment (and that's the reason all this happens), but she shows us the innocent yet unexpectedly evil part of being a kid, exploited by adults (namely Gretthe who thinks that children don't lie). The film moves tenderly, uncomfortably, and at times, suspensefully, through the tough subject matter of adult-child relations and how that is corrupted. If you want to see a great film this year, you can't go wrong with The Hunt, but there are definitely better films."
207,The Hunt,,15 January 2014,Gripping,"The Hunt handles a very delicate subject in a very delicate manner. It's easy to overstep boundaries and make something like this too sentimental, too unrealistic, too much like a plead for our sympathy, and also too much like torture to watch. As it is though, it's all handled pretty realistically (although some of the finale scenes I question). Mads Mikkelsen is pretty amazing in this though, such an understated and subtle actor and his performance here is no exception. It's not a particularly loud role or one that requires much histrionics, but Mikkelsen plays everything with a bubbling intensity under the surface, and it plays to great effect."
208,The Hunt,9,1 May 2013,What a beautiful movie...,"I rarely give a 10 out of a 10 to a movie, especially right after the screening, but this amazingly directed, written and acted little film is the perfect example of how drama should be done. I loved Mads' acting (maybe his character was too calm, given the situation he found himself in), but this actor really surprised me. I already saw him portraying Hannibal Lecter in the new series, and in Casino Royale, and boy, was I wrong thinking he only could perfectly portray psycho and\or evil characters. The director\writer is fascinating in doing his job, so I decided to watch one of his previous works too, Festen. I'll do it soon, and I hope it delivers, just like this one. I loved how he chose not to explain WHY the little girl did what she did, but it was implied, just for us. The viewer has to understand by himself most of the things, and when he does he remains fascinated by this wonderful choice the director made. The ending scene was just brilliant, significative... I recommend this movie to anyone who loves really intense dramas. 10\10."
209,The Hunt,8,15 April 2013,A aching story that makes you reflect on good intentions,"Hunt is a provoking story, set in a close-knit small town, which makes us ponder what we have always believed and how we should act out our beliefs.Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), a quiet and kind man who does not express himself well, works for a kindergarten where his close friend's children attend. Lucas is going through a divorce and negotiating with his ex-wife about his son's custody as a new romance seeps in. An innocent lie by Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), a student in the kindergarten he works at, and the young daughter of his close friend, has created an irreversible turmoil in Lucas' life.We are all horrified by sex abuses cases, especially when it targets at young children. So when it happens we would direct our anger, hatred and disgust to the pedophile, perhaps especially in a Christian culture. We also believe that children do not lie, despite their love for fantasy and imagination. We also believe that we can trust our friends in taking care of our kids. However, when these beliefs are mixed in a small town where people know each other, professionalism dissolves, friendship becomes fragile, even the justice system collapse when residents are clouded by subjective judgment.The terrible thing is even after the case is seemingly resolved and friendship supposedly rebuilt, our protagonist is still hunted and haunted by what he allegedly did and actually did not do.The cast is excellent. Mads does not speak much, but you can feel his pain, anger and helpless in his eyes when he is wrongly accused and then attacked. Little Annika is perfect in portraying an innocent yet aspiring child who is neglected in the family. Sometimes I wonder if she needs to go through counseling after appearing in this movie.The cinematography, especially the natural scenery, is soothing and gives a nice balance to the tension throughout the movie.Yes there are flaws in the script, such as the unprofessionalism of the principal and the psychologist, but I think that aims at building up the dramatic elements. And I believe that in a small town like this, people might not have the experience to deal with such a shock that they might lose their balance."
210,The Hunt,10,6 April 2013,"Once a target, always a target","Can you imagine your whole world is turning upside down one day: you're the same, but the others have changed. Yesterday you were a hunter, and now you are a prey. Children, those you've loved the most, now point fingers at you, friends hate you and the family is confused. Everyone and everything is shaken. Can you handle the fear, the loneliness of being hunted, can you handle the pain? How far will your hunters go to exterminate you, how long can you hold on? There is a crossed circle drawn on you head, on your chest and nothing you can do to erase it. Others mean that you run and fear for your life, like an animal, but still they don't know that they've already killed you with the finger pointed in you. It's just a breathing air that they can take from you: the love that you share remains bigger then the hunt, hunters and the prey."
211,The Hunt,1,7 March 2015,The Hunt - WASTE OF TIME,"It is definitely waste of time. I could not understand why people gave too much rating. I wish I could watch another movie. It is not only a slow movie, but also irritating movie. Hard to believe how Lucas stay so calm. It is totally disaster. I would not recommend this film to anyone. If you are insisting to see,you can watch only 1 hour by forwarding the movie in every 10 minutes :) I have no idea how often a child's claim of this type of abuse turns out to be false, but the film makes an interesting case for how this seemingly impossible thing could happen. Ultimately, ""The Hunt"" is totally frustrating and depressing especially when considering the whole picture quality, acting, scenario."
212,The Hunt,1,8 July 2015,The Hunt: Poorly written abuse apologia *spoilers*,"The Hunt reads like abuse apologia, because the story does not have people reacting in a realistic way to sexual abuse. What is far more likely to happen and indeed what happens constantly in our culture, is people excusing child abuse because they are close to and like the abuser, and saying a child is confused/lying because it is easier and because obtaining ""proof"" is nearly impossible. All the kids suddenly turning on their teacher because ""children lie"" even though we see that there are manipulations in place for Klara to arrive at the conclusions she does...that makes no sense for the other kids. This is chalked up to ""hysteria"" but it is not explained and doesn't follow the movie's own logic for how a child may be manipulated or how parents might ignore what a child is actually saying. There are heavy-handed hunting metaphors throughout unfortunately.If the writer had wanted to go the falsely accused route, a more realistic angle would have been to have Klara's brother be an abuser (he is showing pornographic material to a young child...that is a form of abuse and often a precursor to more sexual activities in these cases) but to have everyone deny it because talking about family sexual abuse is too taboo, and so to conveniently scapegoat the teacher. Perhaps if you do not know much about how sexual abuse and power dynamics function in our society, this film would be more compelling. Art can and should be critiqued within a greater social context, and to make a martyr figure of an accused child sexual abuser is toxic and far from controversial or radical."
213,The Hunt,1,19 January 2014,Typical Foreign Movie,"I try to watch foreign movies with an open mind. But it seems Europe, and Asia, are so twisted, even Steven King and Michael Moore would have difficulty out writing their scripts.This film, while based on reality, is pure fiction. As such, it is political from the start, to ensure that many adults believe that children imagine all sorts of lurid and sick acts, without any education on such. Adults, who are educated, are made to look cruel and ignorant.The United States of America is well known for interfering in foreign affairs. The so called documentaries in the U.S.A. state that it is well known that the sex trade, including children, is alive and well in the world. Many, come from poorer nations of the Eastern world. It is sad, but true. Western countries, have illicit trade too. Pornography, pedophilia, drugs, killings; yet we seem to easily accept a fictional movie's political goal as 'the TRUTH'.Men and women have been put to death in the U.S.A. after being wrongly convicted by our ill justice system. Some of my friends, sit and state how wrong that is. Then, they say that the young boys and girls lie to get adults in trouble.The truth is, it all happens. Every day, every hour. There is no end in sight. Like our war on drugs, as long as there is a demand, there will be a supply. The poor are more easily caught up in the trade than the rich. Education, too, plays a large part. Given Germany's part, Italy's part, and Japan's part, in World War II, why should we ever think that the movies from those countries, especially so warped, are realistic? This movie is a disgusting political statement made by disgusting and uneducated writers, directors, actors, actresses, and producers. It is pure trash. Nothing worth while in viewing it. It lost 3.2 million dollars. 80% of the viewers are not from the U.S.A.If you watch the film, I suggest watching a porn movie next. Which is more disturbing? A film about children lying, or a film about people selling their souls for money.Sadly, today, the families portrayed on TV and in Film are dysfunctional at the least. Why? Because naive people pay to see it. Except, in the case of The Hunt, far fewer people payed, as it was not worth the cellulose it was filmed on.The acting is horrid. The dialogue is slow and full of useless language. There are no facts. There is innuendo. Thus, the director is said to be awesome in his bravery? Swell, let's congratulate all those film directors, actors, actresses who lie to present their political beliefs, and falsely accuse all children of lies. That's a wonderful lesson for this world.SKIP THIS FILM AND SAVE YOUR TIME! DO ANYTHING POSITIVE! Have a blessed year!"
214,The Hunt,7,31 March 2013,"A hard hitting film, reality hits hard bu",This is a very different role for Mads Mikkelson as he's previously played but he does a fantastic job. I'd recommend watching this film just to see his performance of a man who has everything and very quickly has nothing. Reality is sometimes a very powerful and shocking thing to deal with but Mads Mikkelson delivers a fantastic character in this film.This is a great insight into a small town in the heart of Denmark which has been filmed and captured beautifully with a great cast and a plot that will keep you gripped until the very end. If you expecting a film about hunting then this isn't the film for you.
215,The Hunt,3,8 August 2017,Unnecessary movie,"There are not many movies about child abuse - apart from this one, I remember of 'les Risques du Métier' from french director André Cayatte. Why then are they both built on a lie from the child? Isn't there enough case of child abuse, every year, cases that hardly anyone believes, because it is often done by a close member of the family, in a deafen silence? What does a director want to hide or protect, when he chooses to shoot a movie about child abuse from this viewpoint? I can see the big strings used by Thomas Vinterberg, he obviously doesn't like the people, so eager to lynch the first innocent in the town.The script is very thin. The actors don't play well (except Clara the girl), they seem to not believe the story. Funny is the fact that former Dogma addict Thomas Vinterberg shot an actor, Thomas Bo Larsen, with a fake beard,"
216,The Hunt,,28 April 2017,Hunted,"This Danish drama focuses on a kindergarten teacher accused of child abuse due to the lies of a female student, upset over the teacher scolding her for kissing him. Mads Mikkelsen is effective in the lead as his life slowly unravels with a suddenly tarnished reputation, but it is hard to sympathise with him when much of his misery is his own fault. It never makes sense that he does not report the kiss, nor talk to the girl's parents given that he is close friends with them. In fact, it is hard to say what exactly Thomas Vinterberg was trying to convey here as the townsfolk who turn against Mikkelsen start putting words in the girl's mouth, suggesting what may have happened and with the girl's own mother telling her that she is just repressing when she finally admits to lying! The film would almost work as an indictment of how paranoid modern societies about suspected child abuse if it were not for the townsfolk coming off as plain ignorant. The movie is well-filmed whatever the case, with hand-held shots sublimely capturing his anger when Mikkelsen returns to work and finds others talking about him. There is also a lot to like in the genuine bond that exists between Mikkelsen and the girl, accusations aside, but this is a tricky film to watch with the regrettable actions of not only the whole town but the protagonist himself who could have so easily avoided the whole ordeal by reporting a simple kiss."
217,The Hunt,10,11 March 2017,Far From The Maddening Crowd.,"Seeing trailers of the film for years on Euro DVDs and also having been impressed by Mads Mikkelsen's performances in A Royal Affair,gritty Western The Salvation and also turning up in Rogue One and Doctor Strange,I've been meaning to see the movie for years,but have for some reason always missed the chance. Taking a look at what flicks were being shown on the BBC this week,I was thrilled to see it listed,which led to me finally going on the hunt.The plot:Fighting over the custody of his son with his ex-wife, Lucas is relived to get support from the small town,the inhibitions of which include his best friend Theo and Lucas's girlfriend Nadja. In a town where everyone knows each other, Lucas finds his job as a nursery teacher rewarding.Taking a fancy to Lucas,Theo's young daughter Klara makes a heart-shaped ornament,and kisses Lucas on the lips. Horrified,Lucas pushes Klara away. Feeling hurt,Klara decides to get Lucas back,by lying to the town that Lucas has sexually abused her.View on the film:Hearing whispers all across the town, Mads Mikkelsen gives an incredibly subtle,drained performance as Lucas. Losing almost everyone who he has cared for,Mikkelsen makes Lucas's body language be incredibly ill at ease,with his drab clothes and up-right sitting manner making Lucas stand out in every room,which Mikkelsen gives the feeling of crushing all the hope out of Lucas. Going on the hunt years before he would star in the dazzling Nordic Noir series Follow the Money, Thomas Bo Larsen gives a sharply measured performance as Theo,whose friendship with Lucas is captured by Larsen by a gentleness in Theo which turns into pure fury when Theo gets an earful of Klara's claims.Coming from the Dogme 95 movement,co-writer/(along with Tobias Lindholm) director Thomas Vinterberg & cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen retain the emotional rawness of the movement,whilst elegantly dissecting the far from the maddening town mind-set that has fallen in the town. Going to the nursery with Lucas, Vinterberg paints the children's playground in warm Autumn colours that give the title a relaxed countryside mood. Twisting and turning the lie to a more disturbing nature with each passing recipient, Vinterberg pours the colours out in exchange for silver lines of rain and a dour Noir blue mist which rots all of the bonds of trust and love that have grown in the town.Taking on an extremely difficult subject,the screenplay by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm, (who later reunited with Larsen by being one of the writers on Follow the Money) unveil a harrowing examination of ""no smoke without fire"" as the writes keep Klara's lie in the town and allow it to fester in every aspect of the town. Burning away all that he held dear,the writers unleash with a blunt force the darkness of the town,from Lucas being kicked to the curb by his former friends like a Noir loner,to even his loyal pet not being able to escape the collective madness that has fallen on them,as the towns folk go on the hunt for Lucas."
218,The Hunt,9,10 March 2017,"Truth, Lies and Emotion","LUCAS (Mads Mikkelsen) is a kindergarten teacher basically his work is to take care of the child during daytime . His natural sense of fun quickly makes him a favorite with the children. One day Principal claimed that he sexually abused a 5 year girl named Klara, who is his best friend's daughter. From beginning we see that he is falsely accused. Authority decided to extricate the school teacher and also bring the notice to victim's parent.""The World is full of Evil"" said one character to another. Rumours are Spreaded. All of sudden no-one believed Lucas . He is not welcome in Supermarket. Someone attacked his house and killed his dog.""Look At my Eyes, What did you see"" said Lucas to his best- friend. This is full emotional breakdown of Lucas . 1 year Passed now. Everyone behaving smoothly with Lucas. It is day his son gets license to hunt. When Lucas and his son goes for hunting there is scene shown that someone try to kill him. Someone try to alarm him that he is not yet to be secured.Director Thomas Vinterberg brilliantly presented the movie . No background music , hand-held camera action and best Part is Mads Mikkelsen. Just brilliant Acting."
219,The Hunt,9,9 March 2017,The fragility of the social contract,"The presumption of innocence until proved guilty is an essential building block of a free society. In times of tyranny - say, in Stalin's Russia, or McCarthey's America, this is reversed, and the individual is charged with being free from suspicion. This immediately voids the idea of freedom under the law - suspicious behaviour, however so construed, become de facto prohibited; as well as exposing individuals to allegations from cranks and the malicious. But the presumption of innocence is a hard thing for a society to maintain. Supposing someone is accused of something terrible - there may be no concrete proof, but how can such a person expect to be treated by their neighbours? This question is asked in Thomas Vintenberg's film 'The Hunt', which deals with one of the most difficult subjects in our contemporary world, namely child abuse. Child abuse, once ignored, is now rightly considered a very bad thing, but has perhaps been demonised out of proportion to its wickedness - sometimes, you get the sense that society considers a paedophile to be worse than a murderer. In Vinternberg's tale, an innocent man is falsely accused, then formally acquitted - but there's no easy path to his rehabilitation once the accusation has been levelled. Vintenberg is a brilliant film-maker and does a wonderful job at getting us to sympathise with his protagonist through his nightmarish experience; and yet, we also feel for the parents of the child who makes the allegation, and for the child herself. It's a film to make you angry, sad, and scarred at the same time - scared above all else of the delicate basis on which our integration in society depends."
220,The Hunt,,8 March 2017,Very well acted,"This just shows how a community can turn on a person on just a few unproven words, be them from an adult or child. It can ruin lives forever. The story and how it was acted was very well done.This could have been set anywhere in the world. My only sorrow what that the ending was quite weak."
221,The Hunt,7,6 March 2017,Good drama with a twist,"Very watchable film, with good acting all round. However, I noticed from most of the other reviews, that it is believed that the main character is innocent. Im not so sure.The whole film pushes the audience to think he is innocent, eg the fact the girl sees an inappropriate mag and then appears to associate the image with her teacher, who has embarrassed her about her gift. Or the fact he tells her kissing is only for mum and dad, ie it is not appropriate to do that to your teacher. Such scenes make us think he is innocent. And of course the fact that when other kids apparently make similar accusations, they claim they were taken to his basement, which didn't exist.And I was assuming he was innocent right up to the end, when he went to the forest with his son for shooting deer. Other reviews have said the person who seemed to fire at him was unknown, but I thought it looked like his son. Regardless of whether this was 'real' or imagined by the main character, I wondered if it meant the son had been abused when he was very young. And either he knew or had repressed those memories (the head mistress had said that to the little girl) - either way, the father knew. I am convinced the shooter was the son, either real or imagined. And that means something."
222,The Hunt,9,21 January 2017,A raw and powerful film,"One of the very few movies that has made me cringe. It shows how weak our minds become when,Something happens and we do not know how to react because the act is simply disgusting and we become blind accusers blind, people become manipulate with no personal opinion without valid evidence and proof, regardless of the maturity of people. A word and a feeling can quickly rip a life apart. This is what happens when people jump to conclusions, lives get ruined. That's what happens when people lie. The girls can't be really blamed for all this because she does not understand what she did for the simple fact that she Is just a child and she has no idea how deep Her words can cute a persons dignity. for example when the mother actually convinces Klara that it did happen. Now what would happen if a mother did that in a custody battle out of spite and just because she's evil; convince her kids that their father hurt them and abused them and it was so terrible that they just can't remember? Everyone including his family would grow up hating him and for nothing. I just wanted to point out that the Scene were the child psychologist did was wrong and unskilled, know that you are not supposed to imply an answer and nudge children in the assumed direction. When he was was asking Klara questions, he clearly handled it quite poorly. Klara clearly hated to be called a liar or was scared to get punished as she wanted outside when Her parents were Yelling, signaling she was terrified if that happened to her, so she just went along with whatever he was saying. I really hope this is not how things work in the real world. Great movie though, illogicality aside.﻿What i think happened with KlaraConfabulation is distinguished from lying as there is no intent to deceive and the person is unaware the information is false. Although individuals can present blatantly false information, confabulation can also seem to be coherent, internally consistent, and relatively normal, Specially in the mind of such a young child.SpoilersThere are 2 meanings to the ending. 1) is that he will be always hunted because society never forgets once it sees someone as a predator. No matter how innocent you are - you will always be hunted. 2) he was shot at by his friends son because he firmly believe Lucas was guilty, and never realized that the picture he showed Klara would trigger the events, and i have certainty that he also killed Fanny."
223,The Hunt,8,6 January 2017,Vinterberg eventually finds the equilibrium between his full-grown aesthetics and biting social critique with the advent of THE HUNT,"Watching Thomas Vinterberg's widely acclaimed 2012 drama is a smarting experience because it is plain against our nature to watch a man being wrongly accused of a crime he hasn't committed, yet he has to live through its unpleasant repercussions. Lucas (Mikkelsen, in his Cannes BEST ACTOR winning role) is a divorced kindergarten teacher, a tender-hearted, restrained man who loves his work, then one day, out of blue, he is accused of sexually abusing Klara (Wedderkopp), the young daughter of his best friend Theo (Larsen). Soon, his entire life begins to unravel, and from the beginning, Vinterberg gives audience a clear view that Lucas is innocent, so by accompanying him through his purgatory, everyone in front of the screen can ask himself/herself the disheartening question, what is wrong with our society? The first thing jumps into my mind is the disintegration of trust among people, not only among those casual acquaintances, but dear friends, it is far too quickly for Theo and his wife Agnes (Hassing) choosing the side of their daughter without trying to get the whole picture, or at the very least, give Lucas a chance to explain himself after the initial shock, he is their old friend, he deserves that, that's how fragile the bond of friendship, of trust can be broken, just by one false accusation. Then who should be answered for this unfair deal? Klara, a precocious girl who is habitually ignored by her parents and develops an inchoate affection towards the kind Lucas, becomes intuitively vindictive when Lucas reclines her present: a heart-shape ornament she has made for him, and invents Lucas' indecent behavior to Grethe (Wold), the prudish kindergarten director. There is something uncannily disturbing in the story of Klara, in a subconscious sense and at that formative age, her premature mindset is a waking-up call for parents who take for granted of a child's inherent innocuousness, it is the bad seed which will flourish in adulthood if ignored. Yet apparently Vinterberg doesn't intend to burrow into that contentious moral compass, Klara is the origin of the misdeed, but not the culprit because she has no inkling of what kind of damage her words can cause in the first place, a chilling reconciliation scene between her and Lucas betokens a positive vibe of this dark tale. So let's talk about Grethe, in any rate, she is shown as the main drive force behind the accusation, a woman who is so jaundiced in her preconceptions of the affair and unwisely or maybe unwittingly misconducts herself in tackling with the thorny issue, plus there is a self-congratulatory satisfaction in playing the role as a moral defender regardless of whether it is true or not, a typical canker of luxuriating in one's designated authority only to fulfill one's own self-worth in lieu of remaining dispassionate and objective. Finally, there is the self-righteous mob, blindly chooses to jump on the bandwagon as long as they can feel superiority and have someone else to pillory, a convenient and feel-good vent for their respective frustrations engendered from their respective lives, a horror has been rammed home by this compelling cautionary tale. Mikkelsen is indubitably fascinating to watch, his harrowing gazing is searingly indelible in the climatic church scenes (which is also captured by the film's poster). All the supporting players dutifully takes on their various tasks as cogs in the wheel, in particular Wedderkopp, a very delicate role for a kid of her age, and a tangible ambiguity is amazingly elicited under Vinterberg's supervision. Established as a stalwart raconteur and a bellwether of Dogme95 movement, Vinterberg eventually finds the equilibrium between his full-grown aesthetics and biting social critique with the advent of THE HUNT, much kudos to that!"
224,The Hunt,9,30 December 2016,"A movie in a movie, thoughts on how real this is, way more than you expect","This is a great movie, visuals, acting, etc. are all very beautifully done. Technically great and the story is really interesting and frustrating.My only complaints is that the story is unresolved, not the final shot at Lucas or the identity of the shooter, but the identity of the child molester, the police investigation, the mishandling of witnesses (the school conducting their own investigation rather than call the police), etc.However, many commenters and reviewers allege that this film is unrealistic, that people aren't this stupid, that mass hysteria isn't really possible or that people are not so easily manipulated. I point you no further than this very page on IMDb. In some reviews and on the board (on IMDb), there are people still saying that Lucas did it.Yes, there are people that saw this film and saw everything that happened and are insisting that Lucas really did molest the child, even though we know for a fact that he didn't. We know for a fact that he has no basement and no sofa there. These are facts, but people, not characters in a film, not professional actors paid to say words, but real life people that post on IMDb are saying ""he got away with it.""One user, dpwen (check on the boards), says ""I believe Lucas was guilty and Marcus knew it. He found a pair of undies and asked his father about them. I think the undies belonged to the little girl and Marcus believe (sic) that too."" Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the scene where father and son have a laugh between them about ""Dad, I know you're dating someone"" is twisted to mean ""dad, I know you rape children, LOL."" Lucas was clearly talking about Nadja. In fact, the next sentence is ""are you two dating?"" Lucas says ""Yeah, I wanted to introduce you to her, but then this thing happened."" So basically, this user is suggesting that the dad wanted to introduce his son to the child he's been dating, maybe go bowling or something.If you think I'm making this up, just read the reviews and message boards. If you doubt that people can be manipulated by rumors, then how do you explain people that saw this film in full, saw that conversation (""son, I wanted you to meet my girlfriend"") and still assume that Lucas is a child-molester who laughs about the issue, calls an infant girl ""his girlfriend/we're dating"", and has children's panties in his house lying around somewhere.People are so easily manipulated but there are people that don't need anything to convince themselves. They manipulate themselves despite the evidence and common sense.Does this not make this movie better?"
225,The Hunt,8,13 December 2016,The power of lies,"Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt is a gripping and relentless drama that opens our eyes to a real and very possible scenario and continues to hold them open as the film traverses the controversial subject matter with very little fabrication or fluff. Mads Mikkelsen has proved himself again, long after his excellent performance in Casino Royale, and acts as our navigator through this twisted and dark story. His performance is so emotionally honest and raw that I forgot he was acting at times. He covered such a broad range of emotion throughout and it was truly incredible, sometimes even heartbreaking, to see this character's descent into hopelessness. But his emotions never feel played upon. Everything that his character did was completely believable and understandable. We are the only ones exposed to the truth and it is gut-wrenching to not be able to share what really happened. The viewer feels just as vulnerable and attacked as Mads' character, creating not only a strong connection to him, but a vast separation from everyone else. His performance was phenomenal and he alone managed to ground the film in reality when it could've easily been far-fetched nonsense. The story, while fairly simple, manages to be immensely layered. We have themes of friendship, fatherhood, paranoia and public shaming all perfectly balanced in a tightly-written and gripping screenplay. We sympathize with almost everyone at one point because we know that all the characters are negatively effected by this alarming scandal. All the characters we are introduced to are very likable, making the collapse of friendships and family gutting to watch. The film is very simple in it's cinematography as a result of it's want to always have substance over style. It may not be anything interesting to look at, but it's never anything that we should ever really notice. The script and excellent character actions provide enough gripping narrative without the need for exciting or interesting cinematography.There are times though where The Hunt attempts to evoke emotions out of the viewer, and moments like these kind of fall flat. The film is more effective when it takes the subtle approach to the sensitive topic and when it tries too hard to make us feel something, it only comes off as forced and unnecessary. This doesn't happen too often, but when it does, it's quite noticeable. The Hunt tackles a very bold and serious topic that many films wouldn't dare to cover, but Vinterberg does it brilliantly here. We sympathize for a man accused of such heinous acts and, in turn, we as the audience feel within the minority for supporting the character. Deeply layered and incredibly acted, the film hooks itself into you from the very start and doesn't let go even after the credits have rolled. The Hunt is certainly an uncomfortable and depressing experience, but one that I wouldn't hesitate to come back to."
226,The Hunt,9,18 November 2016,A good film,"This film makes me really excited. I almost cried, but did not. Even though being longer than 1 hour and and a half, I feel like reading a short story. The line is pretty clear and the characters of features are very vivid. Actually, this is the first movie that I watched after transferring from the journalism department to the mathematics department. Highly recommend! The reason for Lucas being tortured by residents of their small town is Lucas's kindness. As his friend said, he tolerated too much. And thus, lost his dignity. Fortunately, he chose to fight for himself, and won it. This is a story of an ordinary person that reflects this person's greatness. The actors who play Lucas and Klara's father are awesome. Do not miss it. I feel like being vigorous again!"
227,The Hunt,7,21 September 2016,Saddening but well-told story.,"I've seen a little hatred for this movie come up from what people think the story is trying to say. Child sexual harassment is not something to be handled lightly of course, but I don't think it's fair to say that The Hunt is asking us to all believe people at their word. From my observation, there doesn't seem to be any concrete point that's being made here. The story seems to just exist to get us thinking about the issue and how fragile it is. You can't take Lucas at his word as they all know, but you can't trust Klara either. In some ways, you might call the issue a modern manifestation of To Kill a Mockingbird. There's no courtroom scenes but the prejudice is not that different in nature; it's just directed at a different presumption. Is it really that much different to trust someone based on age rather than race?The pacing was a bit of a problem because the scenes didn't always seem to contribute to a distinct thru line. I think the main purpose of many scenes was to show Lucas' isolation and innocence, but it wasn't always that easy to see that right away. It gave the illusion that nothing was happening, which is true to life in some ways. The dramatic confrontations at the supermarket and the church were both important, but showing Lucas' relationships with his girlfriend and son were equally necessary in their own way. They show that Lucas is a good person that cares about people. If the people of the town were thinking really intently about it, they would have made most of their judgements based on what they observed of Lucas between when Klara made her accusation and when they told Lucas about it.I don't think it's fair to say that the town was cruel to Lucas. If he were guilty of his crime, I don't think most people in the audience would think twice about how he was treated. In a perfect world, all crimes are forgivable, but I can't recall any parents in the news ever forgiving someone who raped their kid. Drunk driving accidents for sure, but something as sick as raping a kid is beyond hard to forgive. We see the villagers as the villains and with good reason, but at least they care about their kids, even if they do it to a fault. Yes, they abuse him more than he deserves even if he were guilty, but it's worth noting that they are showing a universal intolerance for pedophiles.Despite that, we take Lucas side. It's sad how the tiniest lie ruins his life in every way. No matter how innocent he might be, there is no way he can prove it. As with the witchcraft accusations in The Crucible, all the courts and people really have for evidence is Lucas' word against Klara's. And based on Klara's youth and Lucas position as the accused, neither one's testimony can be taken as truth.The technical aspects of the movie were a little bit of a problem for me. I didn't like that the lack of background music. Some of the shots were a little static, probably due to the modest budget. Not that anything was done poorly, but it just could have been shot in a more engaging style if the materials had been available.I would watch this either on your own or with people that you can have a good discussion with afterward. There's a lot to talk and think about. It's not that entertaining, so just be aware of that. It's on the lighter side of the R-rating, but is still a movie for mature audiences just because of the serious atmosphere. Overall Rating: 7.6/10."
228,The Hunt,10,4 August 2016,Good film,"Lucas is a member of a close-knit Danish community and works at a local kindergarten. Divorced, he struggles to maintain a relationship with his teenage son, who lives with his ex-wife, but enjoys wholesome interaction with the children at the kindergarten. His coworker Nadja makes advances towards him and eventually becomes his girlfriend.One of the kindergarten pupils is Klara, the daughter of Lucas' best friend Theo. She has a crush on Lucas, and one day she puts a heart-shaped ornament into his coat pocket, then gives him a kiss on the lips. After Lucas rebuffs the kiss, Klara's feelings are hurt. Drawing on a memory of a pornographic picture her older brother showed her, she makes comments that lead the kindergarten director to believe Lucas indecently exposed himself to her. When interviewed with leading questions, Klara gives unclear testimony against Lucas. The adults in the community believe the director's story of abuse, dismissing Klara's later contradictions as denial.Lucas is shunned by the community as a pedophile and sexual predator. His friendship with Theo is destroyed, the pressure causes him to break up with Nadja, and his son is publicly ostracised. The kindergarten staff ask leading questions of other children at the kindergarten, who also say they were abused."
229,The Hunt,10,5 July 2016,Damn near perfect,"""The Hunt"" or ""Jagten"" is about our protagonist Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen). Lucas is someone who works in a Kindergarten when he suddenly gets accused of having shown his genitalia to one of the kids there.This movie is directed by the Danish Thomas Vinterberg. I had never heard of him, because I usually don't watch foreign movies. Well except of American and English movies (because I'm from Belgium). But I made an exception for this movie because it was recommended to me by Chris Stuckmann and YMS, so I tried to give it a go and I'm happy that I did. This was an excellent directed movie. Thomas Vinterberg doesn't go by the book and uses his own style. He used some interesting things: e.g. The zooming in. This I found very interesting, because not a lot of directors use this technique. Maybe because it doesn't always work? I don't know. What I do know is that it worked very well in this movie. Due to the directing alone I'm already interested in to watching other movies of him. His directing also reminded me a bit of Denis Villeneuve. Not that the style is the same, but the subject matter and how it was handled. More specific to Villeneuves ""Prisoners"" and ""Enemy"" both excellent films. Vinterberg also used a mix of steady cam and hand held. This was also done really good. He also made scenes with violence, if there was any, really intense. The cinematography was fine. This wasn't something fantastic, just fine. The score was really good. It fitted the theme of the movie perfectly and made the shocking moments more shocking. And another great thing about the score were the moments when there wasn't any. With this I don't mean that the score was bad, like I said it was really good, but the silent moments were one of the best, because the silence made it more threatening than anything else. The make-up was done good too.The acting was really superb. The best acting I've seen in a while. Really, as said in the title, damn near perfect. The main actor is Mads Mikkelsen and he plays Lucas. The teacher. I had seen some of Mikkelsens previous work like ""Hannibal"" where he is the intimidating bad guy. In ""Casino Royale"" he is as well the bad guy, so it was refreshing seeing him play a role where he isn't the bad guy. Well he is for some people in the movie, because they see him as a rapist while he in fact isn't one. Mads has proved in the previous said films/shows that he is a very good actor. In this movie however he has outdone himself. We see a more emotional side of him and a more powerful side. I would say with confidence that this was his best performance ever. The girl who accuses him is Klara played by Annika Wedderkopp. She was the most impressive of them all. I am not saying that she is the best one of the movie, this was without a doubt Mikkelsen, I am saying that she is the most impressive one. She was very good and convincing. One of the best kid actors I've seen. What I liked with her is the twitch she did with her mouth. She did this every time she was lying or was going to it. This was a fun little detail that I liked. Lastly I want to mention Theo. Theo was the best friend of Lucas and he was also the father of Klara. Thep was played by Thomas Bo Larsen. I think that he deserves a mention because his reaction to all of the events was very realistic and convincing. The supporting cast overall was also fantastic.The script was great. The dialogue was realistic so was the whole movie. But this is because this could all happen to everyone, well males in particular, with women it happens less frequent. Due to the realism, you can relate more to the characters, because they too feel realistic. Due to this the writers can develop the characters well, and we can see how they handle each situation. Even though they are so realistic, they are also unpredictable. This makes them more interesting and keeps you interested throughout the movie. Another thing that there is thanks to the realism is that the movie is hard to watch. This is of course too thanks to the fantastic characters. I do have a problem with the script and there comes the ""damn near"" in place. The ending came a bit out of nowhere for me. It was a bit abrupt. But the last minute or so I found good again. This was because of the open ending. Who was it that shot? Well, I'm going to leave that for you. I have yet to create an opinion for that, but I like when a movie challenges to think about it even after you've seen it.In the end this movie was really good. It manages to create a realistic feel to it whereby you care more for the characters. The movie had a fantastic cast and so was the director.9.75/10"
230,The Hunt,9,20 May 2016,great,"Like Festen, The Hunt (scripted by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm) is set in idyllic rural Denmark, in a small tight-knit, lower middle-class community, rather than a hut-bourgeois family, but child abuse and the effect of its revelation is still the key issue. But in this case the alleged perpetrator is shown from the start to be innocent. In John Patrick Shanley's marvellous 2008 film Doubt, we are never absolutely certain whether Philip Seymour Hoffman's popular, humane New York priest is a paedophile or Meryl Streep's vindictive nun is merely motivated by envy. This creates suspense by inviting observers to examine the evidence drawn on by the accuser and the accused's defenders. Vinterberg eschews such ambiguity. His embattled hero, Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), is a victim both of something awry in complacent Danish society (in this it resembles and echoes Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon) and the dangerous little lies told by an innocent child."
231,The Hunt,9,2 May 2016,Difficult to watch due to the injustice,"Everyone should watch this movie, because I can see everyone being guilty of doing what is done in it. It captures a behavior that is very human, painfully understandable - but very, very wrong. Because of this, watching the movie can be quite difficult. From tag lines, posters and trailers, I knew what the premise of the movie was, and so I knew what was going to happen. This made the movie even more difficult to watch, like a car crash going in slow motion.This movie shows how people can be cruel without being evil. They can feel perfectly justified in doing things that can ruin people's lives. And though this movie might be an exaggeration - it does not feel like it, and I honestly believe that these sort of things happens all the time. And that only makes it more difficult.I hope that people watch this movie and reflect over how they themselves would act in such a situation. And talk about their kids about it, too."
232,The Hunt,9,22 April 2016,This movie made me believe the unbelievable,"This is going to be my very first review on any movie on IMDb, and I'm certainly writing this with an untrained hand, but this movie has managed to do something other movies have not: It made me feel true empathy for the characters.Alright, this is my second time watching this film, the first time being at the cinema, where I really didn't feel what I'm feeling right now.The main character, Lukas (Mads Mikkelsen), is a completely innocent guy, who right off the bat seems insecure about most things in his life. He works as a teacher in a kindergarten in a small town. When one of the children, in a moment of hatred towards Lukas, tells the head of the kindergarten, that he has done terrible things with her, she takes action, and it eventually spirals on and on and drives Lukas and his family completely off the road. They basically get expelled from the town community.Now, I'm going to point out some things and details that really made this a great film for me:-The amazing acting from Mads Mikkelsen and Annika Wedderkopp. -The fantastic characters, and how they were built up. No actor, no matter how talented, can play an amazing role if the character he is being is unbelievable. -The fact that it isn't overly sentimental. Instead of telling us how to feel, it lets us think for ourselves. -Cinematography done right. -Did I mention amazing acting? Hmm...Even though the story and how it escalates seems completely unbelievable if taken out of context, Thomas Winterberg somehow manages to make me believe it. I find myself almost screaming at my screen at certain points in the movie, where it's so obvious for the viewer that everyone is handling the situation completely wrong. For example halfway in the movie, after Lukas tries to talk it over with his best friend (and Klara's father). After he gets kicked out, Klara is sitting in the other room with her mother, straight up confessing that she lied about Lukas. The mother simply does not want to believe that her little angel lies and she tells her an absolutely, excuse my language, bullshit reason, as to why Klara isn't lying. As a viewer, I scream at the mother: ""Why wouldn't you believe her and talk with Lukas?!"", and I say to myself: ""Wow, these character's actions aren't really believable"", but, when I then ponder over how I would've handled it, I start to accept that the actions might be believable after all.And that's what this film does so perfectly: It makes me believe the unbelievable."
233,The Hunt,10,28 March 2016,"A roller coaster of emotions - You will feel angry, confused, relieved and scared","Alongside the likes of Antichrist and Requiem for a Dream, The Hunt is a slap in the face and a true insight in dreaded circumstances. It deals with delicate subject matter in such a way that it preys on your emotions and leaves you dumbfounded and unsure how to react or think. With stunning performances across the board I was completely immersed and felt more involved in the situation than i was comfortable with. If you are anything like me, this is a movie you will want to talk about, that you will need to talk about. When the credits started rolling and people began shuffling down the rows to leave the cinema, I was completely stunned. The impact of what I had just witnessed left such a mark that I felt I had to pay my respects to Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen's character) and the real people who this story directly or indirectly is based on.This masterpiece reminds me of why I love movies."
234,The Hunt,8,23 February 2016,Similar to Lars Von Trier or better?,"Thomas Vinterberg similar to Lars Von Trier? Jagten ( the hunt) was a movie about a person that lives in a community who tries to prove his innocence about a charge. Clara sees in Lukas face the ''real '' father or better the father that she wanted to have. Thomas Vinterber doesn't show clearly the bad connection between Theo and Clara. For me the problem was that this ''lie'' from Clara that Lukas showed her his willie was too fast and surprised me . In addition, this unclearness lifted if we consider that Thomas (director) wanted to show the way people act when they want to expel a person from a community. The thrown rock and the man with the carbine who shot Lukas was not one person specific but the society which doesn't forget about the category had given to Lukas. Furthermore Thomas shows the way societies work. I want to insist in this because this is the main idea of this movie. Everything that disturbed a society wants to expel this because thinks that this person is responsible for the bad process of her. Also I wanted to see how Lukas managed to become again part of his town and how people introduce him . Because to conclude with the scene with the carbine means that more things than once had become but Thomas skipped them . This director is very similar to Lars Von Trier . There is a difference that must be said. When Lars wants to sock the viewers he shows something extreme . Thomas Vinterberg managed to sock us with the scenery of Jagten because no one expected that Clara would say that thing that she said. And furthermore no one expected that people of his town who know Lucas for many years will react like that way . That's the extreme and this is the reason that Thomas reminded me Lars . Lars wants to attract the viewers by showing scenes extreme instead of Thomas who surprises us from the basic structural of his movie (Clara said that unbelievable lie and locals believed her because '' children always say true'' in contrary to Lucas who is a teacher and an adult with a son. Incredible and socking point of view!!"
235,The Hunt,9,30 January 2016,"Yes, even children can lie!","This is a film where it's sole purpose isn't to entertain particularly but to hit the core of human emotions. How coming up with assumptions and buying into gossip can really effect people's lives. This really is a film that really got to me and made me angry and sad. Not because it's a bad movie, actually it's far from it being a bad movie. It's a film that shows the effects and how it would feel if you were in the shoes of the main protagonist in this. Who basically is a victim that gets ostracized, put down and treated unfairly when they don't even know what really happened. I think the first time I seen Mads Mikkelsen in a film was in ""Casino Royale"" and thought he was actually a stand out villain in the Bond franchise. And he puts on a stand out performance in this, where the emotions of anger, depression and love just came off so raw and real. It didn't seem pretentious or like he was trying hard to show off his acting chops but to show a real character going through unfairness. So the plot is about a guy named Lucas who is a good hearted man that likes children and lives in a small community while working at a kindergarten. He gets accused of putting a child in a sexually touching one of the kids and exposing himself to the child. The child actually told a lie and fabricated the whole thing, the thing about lies is that once you do it, you can come up with more lies to cover up the first one. And that is what happens, thus it leads Lucas getting ostracized and treated less than a human being, actually worst then a dog. Adults can have this perception that children are super innocent and can't tell a lie. Well even children can lie, and lacks the empathy to understand the pain they cause others sometimes as well. The pain Lucas goes through, it really does hits you emotionally as an audience. I know the character that told the lie in the first place is only a child, but I immensely disliked her because of her actions. This film really delves into the human conscious and the breakdown of being judged. And how time can help cope with certain scars, but sometimes it doesn't go away and when you are labeled as something. That label can follow you for the rest of your life. Overall, this is a emotionally powerful film that doesn't try to be more than what it is. And I respect it for that.9/10"
236,The Hunt,10,28 January 2016,Contender for greatest film ever,"This film should be compulsory viewing in all schools, in every home in fact. Jumping to conclusions is something we are all guilty of, especially in these days of keyboard warriors and instant feedback. This film will make anyone think twice, even on the the one subject that is more likely than any to provoke immediate anger. I can't think of any other film that provides such powerful lessons on life, including but not limited to - trust, abuse, manipulation, stupidity, betrayal,loyalty, hope, despair,love, pride and mob mentality. I found myself shouting ""Noooo!"" at the, screen several times and I'm sure you will too. Incredible script, story and acting performances. Contender for greatest film ever."
237,The Hunt,6,6 January 2016,There is no smoke without fire,"Jagten (The Hunt) is a riveting film, with a disturbing and quite interesting story, but that lacks something to make it great.Mild mannered Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) has found a job as a kindergarten teacher, is trying to reconnect with his son, seems to have get the eye of co-worker Nadja and has lots of friends. But when his best friend's daughter says something about him, his world starts to crumble.""The Hunt"" offers a very interesting view. It is not about if Lucas has done or not what people believe he has done, is how everyone reacts to it. He may be guilty, but the society where he lives is for sure sick. From the directed questioning that Ole does to how people start to see ghosts everywhere the movie is saying more about the world were Lucas lives than about him. The always great Mads Mikkelsen is less so here, as he starts too quiet and blank at the beginning of the movie, but he can act in his sleep, so he is still good. All other actors may be less known, but do a great job too. But the movie is also quite heavy- handed in the way it tells the story. Not because one or two plot developments can be seen from a hundred kilometers away, but because it puts a couple of symbols as if it thought we weren't smart enough to understand it without them (like it playing during winter). And the ending is uneven.Really interesting, though and totally worth watching."
238,The Hunt,,18 February 2015,A World Cinema Masterpiece,"Such a flawless movie.Fantastic performances by everyone in this movie especially by Mads Mikkelsen.I hated most of the characters in this, I mean if I had to rate on how much I hate the characters in this it would be a definite 10/10. The only characters that I liked throughout the whole film were Lucas, his son, Fanny and the few people who try to defend Lucas.Fantastic direction, for example Thomas Vinterberg clearly knew how to make this film feel so realistic and deeply emotional.Excellent writing, I mean the dialogue felt so realistic.It's just sad to see the main character go through all the stuff he goes through.I highly recommend this."
239,The Hunt,9,16 February 2015,Unflinching,"Idyllic, bucolic town, where everybody knows and cares about each other. A good place to raise a family, or is it? The innocence of children might be highly overrated, mostly because of us, adults. The purity has no chance for long if tainted by the bitter and suspicious. In a town where your passage to manhood is a hunting license, what we would be more natural than to hunt for any aberration or exception to the norm. And if anybody dares to attack our offspring, all bets are off. Friendly, though highly imbibing companionship, quickly transforms into a vigilante pack of rabid wolves. Hard, unflinching look at the false courage that we humans draw from being a part of a crowd. Either courage or permission to do evil. And there is no going back, you can't unlearn anything. It stays on the outskirts and waits for the right moment."
240,The Hunt,10,4 February 2015,Who are we to judge?,"A small community where everyone knows each other. Kids play in their neighbours garden without question. Socialising tends to involve everyone. Seasonal events are marked on every calendar. And secrets are few and far between. This is the setting for Thomas Vinterburg's challenging film ""The Hunt"". In this village we follow Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), a male kindergarten aid accused of sexually assaulting his best friend's daughter.There are many controversial and somewhat taboo topics tackled in this film; how do we treat the worst people in our society? Are we right to act this way? Do men have control over their sexual identity anymore? What is healthy role for men to play in societal upbringing of our children? What type of person do we believe to be a paedophile? Are we over-zealous in how we protect our children? I could write until my hands bleed on I was reflecting upon by the end of the film, and Vinterburg does an amazing job at demanding his audience to answer these questions themselves.The script is rock solid; judgement is never cast on the characters it is all very real and understated. Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), Lucas' best friend, essentially betrays Lucas when the accusations come out. He sides with the community, he sides with his daughter, and yet we can empathise with his position. All the extreme actions that occur because of this film are treated the same way. Also the beauty of the script comes from inferring everything; it is a perfect example of show don't tell. Lucas's construction, for example, is all shown; the film introduces him as a hunter (a traditional male role), he is sexually conservative as he is the only man to jump into the lake fully clothed, he is a meek as all the drinking games are forced upon him, and his true sexual identity is hidden as he has conversations on the phone away from people about his past and present exploits.Mads Mikkelsen's skill as an actor plays into all of this subtlety. There is no massive scene where Mikkelsen has to sell us his motivation, Mikkelsen plays his character as it should be played, usually removed and tries to take action when it is forced upon him. The change of emotions that happen in both the church and supermarket scene are some of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen. The supporting actors are also amazing in how they deal with their character. I was especially impressed by Lasse Fogelstrøm who played Lucas' son, Marcus. His role required as much emotional range as Lucas himself. And the scene where Marcus turns up at Theo's house show so much potential, I am looking forward to seeing him in future films. I could continue talking for months about everything I liked about this film, but all I am going to say is for the next few days I am going to be incessantly recommending this to people."
241,The Hunt,8,1 February 2015,"Thought provoking, very great movie...then the norm took over","What happens when a lie told by a very trustworthy person goes out of control? Watch this movie and find it out.This is a great movie because it deals with the consequences of a lie told by someone anyone would trust. You can see how the lie is conceived, how it snowballs with the help of each person who cares to hear it, and how it utterly destroys the life of a complete innocent person.I think the actors, while not known by me, were immense. I was at the edge of my chair most of the time. There were even unexpected turns that further glue your eyes to the screen even though there is not a single true action scene. Magnificent movie I say.So where is my problem? Simple, the movie goes great for the first 3/4 of it, then it decides that the viewer had enough so ""let's wrap it up in the nicest way possible"". What? After all that this movie has given us, all the naked reality, all the cruelty, are you going to all wear mickey mouse hats and go to Disneyland (figuratively speaking, I am no giving no spoilers)? The movie should have ended in one of the many ways this could have ended, all attuned with the topic. Or it could give us another twist, but not the one we saw. That one is simply not believable, and betrayed the whole movie.This said, what I did was to mentally plug in one of much more realistic ends I had in my head and not destroy my opinion of a very good and much needed movie to make us think about how easily we become judge of our peers and destroy them unfairly."
242,The Hunt,10,3 January 2015,Beautiful,"There are no words to describe the majesty of this movie. Every scene has its own beauty, makes you want to scream, to shout, to cry... the church scene... damn Vinterberg is good. No unnecessary scenes, everything is there to let you go inside the protagonist and feel his pain and struggle,to make you realise that this situation could happen to anyone. Mads Mikkelsen's performance is outstanding. You feel him from the beginning to the end of the film. Annika Wedderkopp is also very convincing as his friend's daughter.It's one of the best social dramas i've ever seen. I can only advise you one thing before you go see this movie. Prepare your tissues... 10/10 brilliant movie"
243,The Hunt,10,15 December 2014,Great movie,"I don't really watch foreign films, but I am glad I watched this one. I don't know where to start. The acting is excellent, the writing is excellent, and the directing too. I would recommend this to anyone who just loves a great story. I really like how they make you feel bad for this guy. This story is not for people who don't like depressing movies. This movie makes you look at yourself, everyone in this movie reacts like we all do. All they know is that the guy is a pedophile, as humans we judge every single person who commits crime. Even if they are innocent. The father son relationship feels real. I say if you have Netflix go watch it. My conclusion of this movie is that I like everything about this except for one part. (You'll see when you watch it) So I say this movie is a 9/10! It is an excellent movie."
244,The Hunt,9,6 December 2014,A  real emotionsl experience,"everybody can realize this movie. This film is a metaphor of imerfections of humanities. A small childish lie turnes a descent man's life into a living hell. A great movie dealing with failiur in humanity and imperfectionism in traditions. And how taboos and traditions could transform from good to evil, The casting is great, and the performances of the actors are exceptional. A notable screenplay masterfully directed. It will arouse the suspense so masterfully you will not notice how you have drowned into the film.A film genre, and a great example of how a little small matter in life could lead to a big catastrophic life event. And how, a small stupid act could turn your life upside down. A must see!"
245,The Hunt,10,30 November 2014,A truly amazing masterpiece.,"I don't write reviews for films ever - period.I have watched so many films and there are so few that I would rate this highly. This films touched me on so many levels. Brilliantly acted, and a difficult subject dramatised so well.Do yourself a favour - if you want to see a film with real story telling that shows just how cruel injustice can be, then you have to watch this film.Absolutely brilliant - I cannot praise this film enough. It's in IMDb's top 150 films but could just as easily be in the top 50.Simply amazing!10/10"
246,The Hunt,10,14 November 2014,Intensely emotional and quietly powerful,"In a departure from his usual roles, Mads Mikkelsen gives a strong but understated performance as a man whose life is torn apart by a lie. This film takes the subject of child sexual abuse head on, and doesn't pull any punches. Even though, Mad's Lucas is unjustly accused it doesn't matter to the parents who systematically turn him into a pariah and social outcast. It really was heartbreaking to watch. One element I did like was the minimalistic approach to scoring and naturalistic scene composition, which eliminates any pretense and lets the subject matter speak for itself rather than deliberately pushing any emotional buttons. The audience is allowed to feel sympathy for Lucas in a way which is completely organic to the story. Overall, this is a quiet (mostly) yet powerful film which deserves to seen by everyone."
247,The Hunt,9,27 October 2014,Danish cinema at it's best: dark and unmerciful,"Thomas Vinterberg movies are rarely cheerful. Again, Jagten presents us with a less cheerful view on the world. His hit Festen marked in 1995, along with The Idiots (1998) from brother in arms Lars von Trier, the beginning and highlight of the Dogme95-movement. This covenant suggests that directors should abide by strict rules to give back purity to film. Meanwhile, both Danes are far removed from the manifest for which they pleaded twenty years ago. Yet large consumers of the topic violence, madness and evil in humanity still remain.People believe Lucas is sad and lost. What forty-two year old works at a nursery school? The softy has endured quite a few blows with a divorce, an unreasonable ex who'd rather scratch father's day from her vocabulary and a forced resignation. Consequently, he moved his profession to the local nursery school. Lucas draws his strength from the happy little faces who can't wait to see their favorite teacher every morning and feels reinvigorated during his hunting trips with is friends from the village, weekends full of beer and bravery. When fortune finally smiles back upon him - his adolescent son decides he'd rather live with his father and a new co-worker shamelessly starts flirting with him - he is being summoned to the principal's office. Little Klara told an awful story which involves 'wicked teacher Lucas' and 'penis'. It doesn't take very long before the hunt on the alleged pedophile is opened. Subsequently he is condemned, rejected, threatened and beaten. The once peaceful village has suddenly changed in an untamable beast and the life of innocent Lucas becomes a living hell.Where the thematically related 'Doubt', with stars Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman, presents the question whether or not the adult is guilty of wrongdoing, Jagten doensn't pose that question. Lucas is innocent and he himself is the victim in the hunt which follows the lie.Vinterberg and scenarist Tobias Lindholm, who earlier created Submarino together, dare to leave out a lot of important scenes. What are usually considered key scenes in such story - the moment where the suspect is heard by the police - takes place outside the view of the camera. It's courageous not to show these moments to give way for other accentuations. The perspective doesn't always lie with the main character. For instance there is this scene where his son is confronted with the little girl, one of the best scenes from the movie. In the wake of son Marcus, the viewer experiences the conflict he's supposed to feel: the young child has no clue of the damage she has caused. The wavering sympathy for Klara is definitely attributed to the superb acting performances of little actress Annika Wedderkopp (at least as good as the other actors, with Mads Mikkelsen who won 'best actor' at Cannes, on top.) It's harder to sympathize with the indomitable hysterics from the village who see the nursery teacher as the embodiment of evil while thinking they act out of goodness themselves. Their inner struggle is now virtually absent. Jagten could've perhaps been a little more layered.Vinterberg is out to show the horrors of an innocent man being accused with the most objectionable crime. Without the ability to defend and preserve his dignity, his life in the little village community is made impossible. The Danish filmmaker chooses a portrait instead of a psychology, for drama instead of dislocation. But too much of this can have a paralyzing effect and the viewer is easily floored. The accumulation of injustice finds it's impact with the audience in their accumulation of frustration. Nevertheless, Scandinavia has again delivered a solid movie. The combination of Mikkelsen and Vinterberg guarantees Danish cinema at it's best: dark and unmerciful."
248,The Hunt,8,15 October 2014,"Awesome build up - Gripping - At last, something missing","So, this movie starts really slowly. Slowness allows the viewer to enjoy the experience and to cherish the artistic portrayal of human beings and their interaction. Somehow finding beauty and intrigue in scenes that are as close to reality as possible.MOVIE is a gripping and even suspenseful despite being SLOW.When a movie is slow, and gripping at the same time, you have a winner. So, I was thinking WOW this is going to be a 9/10 movie!I know this is a good, superb movie. Up till the final minutes.This is NOT a type of movie you should end without a TRUE closure!I had an idea about what would happen, and I would be totally EXCITED if it would. But it didn't. The problem is , nothing happens. And then, it takes away, from all the build up that the movie has made. It makes you look back and think, oh, a lot of it was for nothing. Just for the ride.I was sure, we would find out at the very end, that Lucas is also the name of her brother and that he is the one who ""abused"" or showed his parts to Klara. That could be integrated into the plot and it would be perfect. Instead just a no end. Figure it out. Takes away from the experience.Ah.. there is just something about this movie that doesn't allow me to rate it any lower than with an 8! The cast! The leading role especially. The simplicity and the gripping effect they were able to produce! Real rating: 7.8"
249,The Hunt,8,13 October 2014,"Phenomenal, understated film, even if the ending disappoints.","Written and directed by Thomas Vinterberg, and co-written by Tobias Lindholm, ""The Hunt"" (""Jagten"") is a riveting drama that proves that a film need not have a convoluted story line in order to enthrall audiences. In fact, the story line is rather simple. Mads Mikkelsen shines as Lucas, a primary school teacher and recent divorcé whose quiet but lonely life in a sleepy town is upended by an 'innocent' misunderstanding. The film is often infuriating: Without giving too much away, Lucas's alienation feels unjust. Certain measures taken by the individuals involved in the madness that eventually ensues, at times, seem thoughtless and rash. But this is simply a testament to the film's poignancy, as well as its ability to captivate its audience. The success of ""The Hunt"" is in its impeccable execution, thanks to fantastic direction, a provocative script, and understated but powerful performances by its cast. As Lucas, Mikkelsen dominates the film through an incredible portrayal that may not be entirely understood by some viewers. For, while much of the slush that reaches theaters is almost irritatingly overacted, the performances in ""The Hunt"", Mikkelsen's especially, are pleasantly subdued -- but not without emotional range. Also worthy of commendation is Thomas Bo Larsen, who plays Theo, Lucas's best friend since childhood. It is no wonder, then, that the film received 49 nominations and 39 wins. But where ""The Hunt"" may have lost some of its wins (the Academy Awards, the BAFTA Awards, and the Globes, to name a few), and where it ultimately disappoints, while still managing to remain an overall success, is through its ending. Given the film's narrative track, as well as its hyper-realism, the ending -- while not entirely dissatisfying in some senses -- felt unrealistic. It was nonetheless a strong ending in some respects, and the film is no less phenomenal for its sole shortcoming, but after the journey on which the film takes its audience, I expected more.Notwithstanding its conclusion, ""The Hunt"" is one of the best films I have seen all year, and perhaps one of the best films I have viewed to date. For that, while I cannot bring myself to give it a perfect score, it deserves no less than an 8/10."
250,The Hunt,9,9 October 2014,"Great, incredibly riveting, suffocating drama","Great, incredibly riveting, suffocating drama. Very realistic - you can easily imagine this happening in today's society. The movie starts innocently enough, and even the event that turns the plot from innocent scene-setting to vicious witch-hunt seems innocuous at the time. However, from there writer-director Thomas Vinterberg builds the tension and ramps up the pressures closing in on the lead character. At times it is unbearable as you don't see anyway out of the spiral of injustice.Reminded me a lot of Arthur Miller's great play ""The Crucible"".Superb performance by Mads Mikkelsen in the lead role. Annika Wedderkop is great as the little girl, Klara.How this didn't win the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 2014, I don't know..."
251,The Hunt,10,4 October 2014,Not just a film - but a real life tragedy!,"This is probably the most powerful film I have ever seen. It had a controversial theme, realistic, raw human emotion and psyche, and a scary side to it, because of the possibility of this being a real scenario (and it most likely has been) just takes one imaginative ""innocent"" mind to conjure up a downward spiral of misery for another.This film made me feel so many emotions, in one fell swoop I could go from angry to nauseated, from happy to sad, from confused to understanding, and so on and so forth. Which in my opinion makes this a well made and structured film in it of itself, but with Mads Mikkelsen in the lead and the otherwise amazing cast, they transform it from a magnificent film into a real life tragedy, which is a rare occurrence for me. To be able to watch and believe that you are a bystander in this world as this huge scandal unwraps itself ""infront of your very own eyes"".Definitely a must-watch for all fans of controversial realistic films and emotional roller coasters out there! 10/10 (Excellent)"
252,The Hunt,9,28 September 2014,Flawless drama,"I am Swedish and this is eaxtly how I imagine Danish people. Especially the scene where they are drinking.The movie is very well made, it is almost like a sophisticated horror movie without the silly horror. Well paced, well acted drama. Im not much of a drama person, very rarely watch this genre. But this one suited me. It is a very solid pice of a movie, so well acted that I have to admit it moved me. I was emotionally moved by this movie. The hoplesness of the main character being accused of something he really could not defend against. And getting most of his friends and people around him, turning against him.I very rarely give out grades of 9-10. I will give this one a 9, and the only drawback is poor rewatch value. This is my first and probably last review on IMDb, sheesh did not know I was required to type up a freaking novel."
253,The Hunt,9,18 September 2014,"Simple In It's Plot And Execution, Yet How Incredibly Effective.","""The Hunt"", is easily one of the top 3 movies of 2012. Mads Mikkelsen delivers such a strong and sympathetic performance as shy teacher Lucas, and how things escalate the way they do in such short time is astounding and well presented.Lucas is a highly-regarded school teacher, who has been forced to start over having faced a tough divorce. Just as things are starting to go his way, a certain level of reject from a 4 year old student forms a little white lie that becomes the truth when gossip, doubt and malice are allowed to flourish and ignite a witch-hunt. Throwing the small community into a collective state of hysteria, the lie is spreading and an innocent man is forced to fight a lonely fight for his life and dignity.Incredibly simple and extremely effective for its 2 hour running time. Mads Mikkelsen's performance is fantastic, winning him the Cannes best actor award. Being that he is the only internationally well known star in the entire cast, this community is performed by more than competent Danish talent, young and old. The script and scenarios border on levels of extreme, and I think the finale is one of the best of the decade so far.Final Verdict: If there's anything negative to say, it's that the pacing feels off a little. Yet how everything gets out of hand really compliments every passing minute. 9/10. Definitely see it."
254,The Hunt,10,4 September 2014,A calm masterpiece,"I'm from Brazil and my review is not biased. I've watch this movie two times in a roll. It's a masterpiece, tragic, hard to watch, but nothing less than a masterpiece. Best thing in the movie: acting. In fact, it seems you are not watching a movie, but a documentary. Characters are real, behave like real people. I know this is not Avatar, so I won't recommend for all viewers, but I cannot deny this is the best a movie can achieve. I will keep a close follow in people involved in this movie, because they are super talent. Mads Mikkelsen, Susse Wold and the rest of the cast is absolutely perfect. A story about paranoia, injustice, relationship, innocence, children, friendship, patience... or simple about life ..................... ........ ,,,,,,, .......................................... SPOILERS HEAD .................................. If you don't understand the ending, here my opinion: It doesn't matter who shot Lucas, the scene is a metaphor for the fact life never will be the same. The scars will be forever open. A shot 1 year after shows to Lucas that he will never have his dignity back. There will be aways a shadow of suspect over him."
255,The Hunt,9,3 September 2014,"A well-made film, albeit unsettling and hard to watch at times.","Jagten, directed by Thomas Vinterberg, is about a man whose life is shattered when he is falsely accused of being a pedophile.Mads Mikkelsen plays Lucas, a school teacher who works at the local nursery. He lives in a small community, the kind where everyone knows each other, and apart from occasional drinking and deer hunting with his friends, Lucas lives a mostly solitary life. He is divorced and currently fighting to gain custody of his teenage son, Marcus. One day, one of his students, Klara, while talking to the school's principal, happens to mention something that implied she was molested by Lucas. She was lying, but being 5 years old, Klara had no grasp of what the consequences would be. What started as a small lie quickly evolved and spread all over the small town, turning Lucas into a pariah.Jagten was one of the contenders for Best Foreign Language Film in the 86th Academy Awards, and after seeing it, I have to say the recognition is well-deserved. It's affecting and provocative, the kind of film that lingers in your mind after you watch it. Mads Mikkelsen is excellent as Lucas. I'm used to seeing him play the villain (I love Hannibal), but he was effective as a good man struggling to maintain his dignity against all odds. Jagten, albeit unsettling and hard to watch at times, is a well-made film and easily one of the best I've seen recently."
256,The Hunt,8,31 July 2014,A Cynical Tragedy,"Alongside with Lars von Trier and Michael Haneke, Thomas Vinterberg is one of those contemporary filmmakers who constantly deal with the secrets and lies, wrong-doing and evil that lie beneath the jolly surface of bourgeois reality. His latest film ""The Hunt"" (2012) is no exception. It is a slowly developing tragedy about a man whose life and position in a community are suddenly shattered due to a lie of a child. The film is exceptionally melancholic in its revelation of the readiness of people to judge, abandon and destroy on the basis of false judgments. At its heart, it is an extremely cynical film about the relationship between the individual and the community.If ""The Hunt"" has a clear-cut thesis, it would be that our world views and systems we create such as work, friendship and religion are veritably fragile. They can perish in a blink of an eye because very often they are not real. In this case, an innocent lie triggers a chain of events which leads a small community to isolate one of its members. In the end all is seemingly forgiven, but it is more difficult for the viewer to forgive the people who were so ready to abandon the protagonist. It is difficult because we have witnessed the inhumanity of our systems.These systems we create are maintained to the very end. This particular community, for instance, holds onto such truths, which it considers self-evident, as that children never lie and that forgiveness is almighty. The former is the truth which brings this community on the verge of destruction. However, the most serious sin of the community, I believe, is their faith in another truth or untruth which one of the characters proclaims to his child: ""The world is full of evil, but it will go away if we stick together."" One who has seen Vinterberg's ""The Hunt"" knows that this is a false belief. This realization isn't a moment of rejoice. Instead it is a moment of melancholy. It is sad that we cannot believe in this. The community thinks that they can hide away from evil by relying on the community, but in reality it is the community which is guilty of the real crime and act of evil in the film which is the judgment of the protagonist. This nihilistic portrayal of the relationship between the individual and the community is laid out in a style which derives its inspiration from the aesthetics of the Dogme 95 movement, but Vinterberg merges it with subtle instances of poetry. The hand-held cinematography and dynamic editing, which allows no shot to be too brief nor too long, creates a tension which is without comparison. In addition, however, Vinterberg uses different motifs and metaphors associated with hunting which bring beautiful poetry to the film. This is done so well that the social reality depicted never escapes into spheres of poetry which might hinder Vinterberg's nihilism. This is important because there is no moral resolution. There is no hope in sight."
257,The Hunt,9,10 July 2014,Antiheroes of the world,"Well, the guy from my local videostore has told me that this film would be slow paced, but, from the moment that Klara kissed Lucas in the mouth on, the storyline became extremely involving, so I may disagree with that guy. For a moment, I had the impression that everyone around felt like kissing Lucas haha, even thought he never seemed to give such liberty to people. After the young girl tells the school's principal that Lucas showed his genitals to her, the story became extremely AGONIZING, due to absurd behavior from most of the people-- including school's principal, Grethe. I mean, child abusing is a SERIOUS accusation, and people should've been much more cautious on dealing with that. You know, hold on to the police investigation and stop telling everyone around what the guy has supposedly done; if he really did that, let the authorities do their job. The directing is AMAZING, and it lets the spectator notices what characters are feeling; for instance, when Lucas goes to Theo's house to explain what happened, you can see in Theo's face that, in the first seconds, he was like ""I don't wanna talk to you"". After some seconds, he'd change his expression to something like ""I really hate you, but I admit that I should listen to what you have to say, in respect of our friendship"". And that's something that directors rarely are able to do. James Foley did in a similar way in 1996 ""Fear"". The only thing that I disliked about this movie is how fictional it gets sometimes; I mean, would Danish society react that way to someone accused of pedophilia? We all know how developed is such society, so it feels implausible for me to see such reaction. However, the movie as a whole is extremely touching, agonizing and affectionate, and I don't see a reason why someone can hate it. This is one of the best movies made in 2012, for sure."
258,The Hunt,9,7 July 2014,Modern day which hunt.,"'The Hunt' is not a mystery movie.we are not in for a Roshomon effect.We know from the start that Lucas is not guilty.Also,the movie avoids stylized camera-work.All these makes the movie hugely dependent on its performances.And that is where Mads Mikkelsen steps in. Mikkelson shows his versatility by playing the role of a subdued kindergarten teacher who is falsely accused of Pedophilia.His performance won him Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival. 'The Hunt',aptly titled,is so unsettling it would linger in your head for quite some time.The movie is a brilliant psycho-drama and is very hard to watch.Its a must see."
259,The Hunt,10,19 June 2014,Excellent!,"'The Hunt' is an intense, unsettling, disturbing, powerful film, that left me spell-bound, by its sheer impact. Without a shed of doubt, one of the FINEST Danish films in years. 'The Hunt' Synopsis: A teacher lives a lonely life, all the while struggling over his son's custody. His life slowly gets better as he finds love and receives good news from his son, but his new luck is about to be brutally shattered by an innocent little lie.'The Hunt' captures the monster in all of us. The demon within. It narrates a story of a elderly man accused of being a pedophile & what happens from there on. Its an unsettling story, that has the power to captivate & disturb its viewer. I was deeply effected by the film. The Screenplay Written by Tobias Lindholm & Thomas Vinterberg is incredibly engaging & intense. Even the dialogue, are hard-core. Thomas Vinterberg's Direction is vast. Cinematography is perfect, while the Editing is sharp. Performance-Wise: Mads Mikkelsen is astounding. He enacts the haunted protagonist with flourish. Alexandra Rapaport is natural to the core. Thomas Bo Larsen is highly-efficient. Annika Wedderkopp is extra-ordinary. On the whole, 'The Hunt' is an excellent film in all respects. Two Thumbs Up!"
260,The Hunt,8,11 June 2014,Just good,"Slow development, this film hasn't got any interesting plot twist and any intrigue at all. It is artistically excellent, with a very remarkable camera work. But in my opinion it doesn't get to create a strong empathy with the protagonist and his situation, and that makes it a boring, empty film to the viewer. The most interesting point in the script is that it shows how you can end in a bad situation by totally haphazard without having done bad to no one. It is impossible to make any spoil of this film because its plot is completely predictable. This film could be classified...I don't know, maybe like ''pure realist cinema''. It's the first Danish film I watch and, truth be told, Mads Mikkelsen (maybe the best known Danish actor out of his country) plays his role magnificently.8. Far away from the masterpiece I was told about."
261,The Hunt,8,9 June 2014,The Hunt is on,"The serene nature of a Danish village are juxtaposed to feelings of agony and turmoil when a teacher is falsely accused of sexual abuse by a minor. It's easy to think of all the pedophiles who deserve harsh punishment, but this film exposes the other side of the story; those who are falsely accused. When innocent children are involved, fair trials take a back seat to the natural human response of suspicion and rage. Through vivid and emotional performances from the actors a gripping story unfolds amidst the beautiful Fall and Winter seasons of Denmark. This is an understated yet beautiful film that made me ponder the fragility of our social standings at work, in our neighborhoods, and in our homes."
262,The Hunt,,29 May 2014,Very engaging and unnerving,"This film tells the story of a kindergarten teacher who is accused of sexually abusing a child in kindergarten.""The Hunt"" is about Lucas, an honest and loving kindergarten teacher. We see him playing with children in the playground, enjoying and trying his best at his job. One accusation turns his life upside down. The film concentrates on how the town reacts to the accusation, and how Lucas is treated (in a shocking manner, I must add) by the people who were once his best friends. The plot is so engaging because it is really good and believable. Every event depicted seems like real life. However, I was almost angered to see that Lucas did little to clear his name. He just took all the accusations and abuse. The ending fast forwards to a year later, and I wish they had shown the events between the year because I really want to know what happened.""The Hunt"" is highly relevant to every one of us, because such an unfounded accusation can happen to anyone of us. That's what is making the idea so unnerving, adding realism and suspense in our minds. In addition, ""The Hunt"" provokes the much needed discussion of how we treat suspected criminals outside the law. We need to have compassion and respect for everyone."
263,The Hunt,9,28 May 2014,amazing,"I loved this film. The only reason I didn't give it 10/10 is because it went downhill for me after it said 'one year later' it seemed everything was back to normal, although I loved the ending, there was a gap before it. I really wanted to to see Lucas have a go at em all and be a bit more verbal about the whole thing. I wanted to see especially Theo and his Wife apologize for not believing him etc... it annoyed me how he didn't put them in their place! But I guess that was the point. But apart from that it was an unbelievable character drama, that give you all the emotions at some point in the film. And Mads Mikkelson has carved his way into my top 10 actors after this, casino royale and Hannibal. The film is So underrated and overlooked!"
264,The Hunt,10,26 May 2014,Amazing,"Review Score - 9.5/10What can be said that hasn't already been said about this film. The story is truly compelling, the performances are great especially by its lead and is paced very well. The fact that such a hysteria caused is not far from the truth (google day car sex abuse hysteria) is truly a scary thought and one that the film tackles head on and unflinchingly. You feel really moved and sympathetic towards his situation as the story continues to unfold worst for him. This was helped by not only his great performance but also how natural the story feels and intertwines the different characters which respond very much the way you'd expect a situation to turn out. This doesn't necessarily makes it feel too predictable but more so adds to the realism and truth behind everything you see. You'd expect things to get worse but there are some really powerful events that you think wouldn't happen but seem perfectly reasonable because of his dire situation. An example of this was when Lucas confronts Theo in the church and escalates to punching him repetitively and not in the way of anger but seeking his help. In summary, it's a great film and up there amongst the best in its year. Definitely better than some films out right now but which people love. 9"
265,The Hunt,10,18 May 2014,A great and heartbreaking movie,"The topic is most depressing and I thought what more could they do with this movie as engrossing as it was for the first half. I didn't want to end up depressed watching a fait accompli tragedy. I was wrong. This movie truly deserved the awards it received and the acting by all involved was remarkable as was a script that could not have been better. in lesser hands this film could have been a maudlin, pedestrian and predictable affair that would not deserve spending much time watching. But by taking a topic that automatically involves controversy and skillfully weaving characters with depth, honesty, and a realistic portrayal of human nature a great movie was made. By all means, do not be turned off by the topic. See this movie."
266,The Hunt,9,29 April 2014,A beautiful film based on a dark premise,"The Hunt is an example of dramatic film making at its very finest with a unique concept, brilliant acting and beautiful cinematography making it in to one incredible film.The film starts with Mikkelsen's character Lucas struggling through a divorce, not seeing his son for a long time. Just when things start to look up for him and he finally wins custodial rights, he is wrongfully accused of sexually assaulting a child. It is because of this lie that his life falls to pieces as he loses his job as a teacher, his friends and even his own safety as the rest of the community begins to threaten him. It's a great drama filled with tragedy that also translates pretty well over to other audiences as the fear of isolation and losing ones place in society is something we can all relate to in some way or another.Certainly though one of the main things that helps this film become great is Mads Mikkelsen giving an incredible performance emphasising his skill. Throughout the film he remains a truly lovable character who we both admire and feel sorry for as we see him persevere through all his problems as his emotion really comes across on screen. The poster alone shows this clearly as when I first saw that poster I felt the pain his character felt and those feelings are reflected throughout the entire film with the film not being afraid to have a quiet moment for the character to reflect upon the sadness that he's going through.With this comes two other great characters. Firstly the father of the girl who Mikkelsen is accused of raping who demonstrates a great conflict between wanting to believe his friend and the need to protect his daughter as his actions are carried out with great uncertainty. Then there is Mikkelsen's son who becomes one of the most likable teen characters I've seen believing entirely in his fathers innocence and being willing to stand up and fight for it. Both of these characters are great and whilst not as great as Mikkelsen's character both felt as if they had enough depth and likability that they could've been protagonists of their own movies.The rest of the town does nothing but make us hate them more and more as they continue to relentlessly persecute Lucas despite the lack of evidence of the rape and previously being close friends with him. Not only does this reflect the significance of the concept of no punishment without law, but also it shows what we are all capable of and how monstrous we can become within our society.To top off such a great story we get a brilliant environment for the film to take place in, with a rich quiet environment of a little town near the woods. It's so separated from the rest of society emphasising how close this town is and how isolated Lucas becomes.It's a great film that's well worth the watch as soon as you get a chance. It not only follows a great story, but also has a great lead to pull it off and because of this really gets over the overwhelming emotion of the story."
267,The Hunt,8,25 April 2014,A Compelling Look at a Serious Matter,"I feel ashamed to admit that I did not see a single film nominated for Best Foreign Film at this years Academy Awards. Some of these films are now making their way to streaming sites like Netflix and Hulu Plus, so I am now seeing them. Better late than never. The Hunt is an extraordinary film. It was Denmark's submission for Best Foreign Film, and it rightfully was submitted. No, it did not win; it lost to The Great Beauty from Italy, but it is still a phenomenal film.The movie follows Mads Mikkelsen (Hannibal Lector on the new NBC show) as Lucas, a kindergarten teacher (who we would all want as kids.) He loves his jobs, but he is struggling with the custody over his son, who he hardly gets to see; he has a beautiful girlfriend and has great friends. Things however take a turn for, well, the terrible. His life is completely shattered by the wrongful accusation that he is a child molester, after a little lie and a bad procedure of events. His life turns to ruin, people abandon him except for a handful, and he is labeled a pedophile who cannot go to work or even the grocery store without getting denied service and verbally and physically assaulted. Mikkelsen is brilliant. He ranges from a happy and playful teacher to a lonely and outcast man who loses literally everything. We truly fear for him because of his wrongful accusation and we do not know what will happen.The audience knows he did not molest the child, but it is merely a child's ignorance of things bigger than them that gets him in trouble. We just want to yell at the people to listen to Lucas, to look him in the eyes, but nobody ever gives him a chance to explain himself. He is cast off like a pest the instant word hits the streets. Just like in Atonement things can be changed so easily, but once the word is out people cannot look at Lucas the same way again and is thus too late. Annika Wedderkopp, who plays Karla, the girl who lies about Lucas, is exceptional in what is her first movie. She can't be older than 4 or 5, but she is one of the scene-stealer's. The director, Thomas Vinterberg, handles the subject matter with a deft hand. Making a serious subject something accessible while also showing the effects it has on the people involved. His direction makes the movie an absolutely compelling watch, keeping you on the edge of your seat up until the very end.The film is beautifully shot; highlighting the beauties of Denmark and the darkly lit interiors of not only the houses, but of the mind that Lucas descends into. The supporting cast is great too, watching how everyone absolutely adores Lucas just to have them flip on a dime and start loathing the very idea of him is a painful experience. It is all full of heartbreaking performances from a stellar cast.The movie does raise the question about pedophilia though. I am not saying that I am believing that all children lie, but this movie brings for the idea that some might indeed not tell the truth, and people are so quick to believe their kids that they are ignorant of what actually could have happened. Despite multiple people speaking of Karla's vivid imagination, they still believe her lie. The movie also shows that some of the questions can be very leading into having a child answer something that they may not understand, thus leading to an even worse situation.The Hunt goes to show that some people may be unjustly accused and judged for crimes they didn't do. It is full of great performances and beautiful cinematography, but most importantly it raises questions about a subject that is so easily seen in black and white, it reveals that there is some gray area, that people should not be so quick to judge, and that there is always room for error.For more reviews, check out Ragingfilm.com"
268,The Hunt,9,16 April 2014,Evil is Taken for Granted,"Sometimes, it really is this simple. This could be a commentary on our justice system, but it's not even American. This film speaks a universal language. It all comes down to the ending. Klara will never change. Her huge imagination keeps her from stepping on any lines...and the irony is that she crossed one. Her innocence will keep her from being harmed, but what protects Lucas?The final moments are a symbolism of everything Lucas has been through. He sees a helpless deer, much like himself only a year ago. He lets it go, lets it live, and we hardly think anything of it until BOOM...a misfire right above his head. Accidents happen, and it could have been a lot worse. The villain of the film is the school principle/teacher/woman who Klara FIRST spoke to. She brushes it off, and for a few minutes, we are relieved as Klara's cryptic feelings were not exactly expressed. However, when this woman goes home, she apparently doesn't sleep at night. When she speaks with Lucas, she is reassuring that this won't be a big deal...until Ole, a friend of hers, speaks with the child and somehow confirms everything. It's subtle, simple, and serious, but perhaps the child was just saying stupid things at first. Then, the mother believes she's saying stupid things when she later denies it. Perhaps we can all learn something...but I'm afraid this movie is merely reiterating ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf."" That's the story I'll tell my children and hopefully it will have as much of an impact when this film is shared. The father was right, though, there is a lot of evil in this world. So much so that sometimes...we take it for granted."
269,The Hunt,9,1 April 2014,I want a word with Theo. look into my eyes. look me in the eyes. what do you see? do you see anything? nothing. There's nothing.,"The Hunt is the story of a popular and well respected kindergarten teacher (Mads Mikkelsen) who's life and personal relationships are destroyed when he is falsely accused of sexually abusing one of his students.The Hunt is a haunting and disturbing experience, but not in the sense that it is violent or gory, but more in the sense that the overall situation and events are so heavy and dramatic with such a bleak and depressing atmosphere, that it leaves the viewer with a feeling of discomfort. The biggest compliment that can be given to a foreign subtitled film, is that after a while, you forget that you're reading subtitles. The acting and dialog are so riveting and engaging, you forget that you're even reading the dialog. It feels like a great book that you just can't put down.My only problem with the film is that the ending is very abrupt and nothing is resolved by the end of the film. For some films, an unconventional ending can work fine, but without a proper resolution to the central conflict, the audience feels unsatisfied by the conclusion. Nonetheless, The Hunt is a tense and uncomfortable thriller that hopefully more people will see thanks to its Academy Award nomination."
270,The Hunt,10,31 March 2014,Drama at it's best.,"The Hunt surely goes into the list of best drama movies in recent years. It will keep you hooked to the screen IF YOU LOVE DRAMA. The story builds up slowly and explains pretty much all the background necessary to know the characters in the movie and to help you make your opinion on them. None of it seems rushed. The location is mostly gloomy, which adds to the story's setting.Although the setting was very serious and most of the actors did not need to change their expressions often, they've done a great job. The casino Royale villain, Mads Mikkelsen lives up to the expectations and surprisingly, Annika Wedderkopp is the second best actor in here. She captures people's attention and every scene she comes into, she makes you anticipate something to go wrong.All in all, I'd suggest drama lovers not to miss this movie and non-drama lovers to see it through a drama lover's eyes."
271,The Hunt,9,28 March 2014,The Movie's Tagline Quickly Becomes An Understatement,"Since I am currently trying to find movies on IMDb's top 250 list that also air on Netflix, my new endeavor has finally brought me to The Hunt, and it did not disappoint. Mads Mikkelsen (TV's Hannibal) brilliantly plays a divorced teacher who, out of nowhere, is falsely accused of sexual misconduct with a child, and shortly thereafter the movie's tagline ""The lie is spreading"" quickly becomes an understatement!Writer/Directer Thomas Vinterberg flawlessly creates a convincing a tale (based on a true story) portraying how fast a lie coupled with convolution, ignorance, and fear can turn someone's life completely upside-down, and forever stigmatize them.Acting, cinematography, story... this film was great on many levels, and has you thinking many hours afterwards. A MUST see."
272,The Hunt,8,24 March 2014,"very well-executed in terms of performances and look, but could have been even better.","'The Hunt' looks fantastic. THe hand-held aspect is carefully executed adding realism without being annoying at all, and the overall 'look' is fantastic.Madds is spectacular.The story is disturbing, shocking, unnerving, and more often than not, frustrating. They managed to throw just a little humor and positive vibes, but not nearly enough to balance the overall dreary tone.The film had me glued and locked for the duration, but there is no payoff, or at least much of one. I really wish the film would have either explained any agenda's of some of the other adult characters, or had some better explained shock-ending, but instead the film decides to follow the very realistic approach, which probably won't endear it to larger audiences. Call me a Hollywood-ending lover, but I'd almost rather seen ""The Hunt"" meets ""Taken"", or ""The HUnt"" meets ""Kill Bill"", and had Madds turn all madman on the town,... but I CAN still appreciate this for what it is... a very well-made, likely under-viewed top-15 film from 2013(u.s. release anyways).The whole 'children don't lie' aspect is not only unrealistic, but it's actually drilled into your brain here, but the philosophy still doesn't work.. and that open-ending too... those aspects made this potentially great film, simply good.Highly recommended.You'll like this if you liked: The GIrl WIth The Dragon Tattoo(both u.s. and French versions), Trust, Shallow Grave, Session 12, and Vinyan. All are good except Vinyan. Not that it's terrible, but the reviewed film plus the rest mentioned here are really strong flicks.82/100"
273,The Hunt,9,17 March 2014,A true insight into what one little lie can cause.,"This is truly a masterpiece of film making and a real departure for Danish cinema. The direction and acting throughout is, I would say, flawless. Despite the film's dark and uncomfortable topic, it goes about it in a poignant and thought provoking way. We see how a divorced man desperately wanting custody of his teenage son, is unjustly faced with the baffling accusation of sexually abusing a young girl. Not only is he a teacher at a kindergarten but the young girl is the daughter of his best friend. The film presents how quickly a little lie can explode into something that can ultimately ruin a persons life. Yet what is so masterfully created by both actor and director is complete understanding for each character and the position their faced with. I highly recommend this film, Thomas Vinterberg has outdone himself, not to mention Mads Mikkelsen gives a truly stellar performance. I feel it was robbed of Best Foreign Language Film of the Year at this years Oscars."
274,The Hunt,8,8 February 2014,There's something rotten in Denmark . . .,". . . and it's spelled ""m-e-n,"" according this this Danish expose, THE HUNT. Here in the United States, no man would dare be by himself with his best friend's 5-year-old daughter, let alone supervise a whole playground full of kindergärtners! As THE HUNT proves, the least little teacher comment perceived in a negative way by a child will result in wild molestation accusations, as likely as not, and then it's only a matter of time before an outraged public will kill your pets, beat up your kids, and burn down your house. As school principal Grethe states here, ""children never lie,"" and where there's smoke, there's sure as heck to be Hellfire. That's why here in America the majority of men sport the patented ""Privates Cam"" underwear brand, which records their junk in High Def 24\7. Sure, those Danes ""letting it all hang out"" in THE HUNT's opening skinny-dipping scene may say that the American ""Privates Cam"" is an invasion of privacy, but since our McMartin Pre-School Witch Hunt, no thinking U.S. man has left home without one. If the accused ""Lucas"" character in THE HUNT had worn a ""Privates Cam"" for excursions outside his home, this flick would have been an hour shorter. When ""Klara"" told her lie, Principal Grethe could have just yanked out his ""Privates Cam,"" fast-forwarded through the previous few weeks, and seen for herself that ""Lucas"" only brought out his Johnson to ""pay the water bill"" and entertain his grown-up co-worker. Case closed."
275,The Hunt,9,4 February 2014,Artful Danish Oscar contender keeps up the tension till the very last shot,"Haven't seen Mads Mikkelsen in any of his villainous roles, but here he's spectacular as an innocent manLucas, a divorced, downsized schoolteacher who gets a job in a daycare centerwho's made out to be a villain by clueless officials and small-town vigilantes. Some reviewers have found it hard to believe that the director of the daycare center and the psychologist (or whoever that rumpled old guy is) who's called in to investigate could still subscribe to the long-discredited ""believe the children!"" thesis, or that Lucas, after his initial confrontation with his accusers, would do so little to exonerate himself. I didn'tlots of similar cases were reported on in the US in the 80s and 90s, and Lucas does lawyer up after the cops get involved; it's not clear what else he could have done. And even if the screenwriters did cut a few corners here, they do a beautiful job of dramatizing the trivial series of events, witnessed only by the camera and the little girl, Klara, that sets all this in motion. The plot is never predictable (except maybe for one sceneyou'll know which one I mean); dramatic tension is sustained to the very last shot. The five-year-old actress who plays Klara is totally convincing; nice touch that Klara seems to have some symptoms of OCD, which makes her dreaminess and distraction even more poignant. Btw, I just read in another review that Vinterberg wanted to set this film in Canada, where the good-old-boy deerhunter culture of the village could have been much more intense. Here the deerhunting seems to take place in a game preserve that's attached to a handsome manor housevery Old World. Big ups to whoever's been licensing all these great Danish films for streaming on Netflix."
276,The Hunt,10,4 February 2014,"Ladies and Gentlemen - This is cinema ""Reborn"" !","No Over-sized hunk hero, no plastic fantastic heroin, No special effects, no supercomputing, no explosions, no car crashes, etc ..... The list can go on forever.Realistic people in a realistic environment enacting a true and often overlooked social issue and living through its repercussions. Simply put the film is pure heaven to watch!This movie coming from Sweden gives us a new interest in the products that Europe and the international film arena has to offer. Does this mean that if you want something out of the ordinary and something that is close to reality we might be better off looking in small movie industries or films of new producers, directors and production companies? This will require more films from all over the world to make it on stage. I think we are witnessing a rebirth of the real cinema and we are in for a ride of our lives in the near future.A standing ovation and respect to everyone involved in its making. Fantastic work. Keep it up!"
277,The Hunt,9,1 February 2014,Very moving,"I had numerous reactions to this film, experiencing everything from indignation, to shock, to anxiety. It is rare that I react to a film in this manner and I have to applaud the actors and the director of this film for crafting a very good movie, in my opinion. Many moments were hard for me to watch and I wept like a baby during certain scenes. I feel that the Oscar nomination this movie has gotten is well deserved and I highly recommend this movie but it can be an emotional experience for some. I would be very pleased if it won for best foreign film because of all the emotions it elicited from me. If you are interested in watching a film with captivating performances this is a film for you."
278,The Hunt,9,31 January 2014,A wonderful social-psycho study of a small community,"""Look into my eyes. Look me in the eyes. What do you see? Do you see anything? Nothing. There's nothing. There's nothing. You leave me alone now.""Danish director, Thomas Vinterberg (The Celebration), delivers a powerful and emotionally draining drama that will leave audiences hooked and feeling enraged for what Mads Mikelssen's character goes through in his closely-knit community. It's a film that will resonate with you and stay on your mind long after it's over. Building on Mikelssen's powerful and engaging performance this is a thrilling psycho-social drama that studies the mob mentality very closely while showing us how a lie that's been accepted takes on a life of its own destroying innocent lives in the process. That is what makes this film so infuriating and despite not having any action it builds a lot of mental pressure on the viewer. The Hunt was my favorite foreign film of 2013 and Mikelssen delivered one of my favorite performances of the year (he won the Best Actor Award at Cannes for this role). His character is very restrained at times, but his facial expressions are very expressive. The church scene was one of the most powerful and emotionally draining scenes I've seen all year. This may be a difficult film to watch at times, and the tension can be overwhelming, but this psychological thriller is a must see.Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a former teacher who is recovering from a difficult divorce and battling over his son's custody. He lives in a small community where everyone has friends in common. Lucas spends a lot of time with his closest friend, Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), while currently working at a daycare. The film opens with a lot of laughter between Lucas and his friends first and between Lucas and the children who adore him at the daycare, but this friendly community changes when one of the little girls named Klara (Anika Wedderkopp) accuses him of sexual abuse. This innocent little lie begins to grow as the community reacts with hysteria and accuses him without having any other proof than what this little girl said. The only reasoning being that clearly a girl wouldn't lie about something like this. Lucas's life is shattered and his reputation has been stained forever despite the law finding him innocent. The little lie affects everyone around Lucas including his son Marcus (Lasse Fogelstrom) and his girlfriend Nadja (Alexandra Rapaport). The damage has been done.This social study about people giving in to hysteria was co-written by Thomas Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm. It's a modern witch hunt tale while at the same time a character study of an innocent man that suffers from his community's harsh judgement. While watching this film one can't help but recall the Cosby series, Kids Say the Darndest Things, because it's exactly what you think when this young girl accuses this man. It's an unsettling and difficult story about a persecuted man which reminds us all that even though you may have won a legal battle, the social effects remain, especially if you live in a small community. The last film that infuriated me like this was In the Name of the Father, and in that film the story only focuses on the legal aspect, imagine the ordeal the main character still had to go through to clear his name from the people who are still second guessing and judging you. A legal victory seems something to cheer for, but The Hunt reminds us that the most difficult jury is the society and community we live in, and their minds aren't easily overturned once they have decided on something. This is simply a powerful and enraging drama that reminds us how judgmental we tend to be towards others."
279,The Hunt,7,24 January 2014,"Not completely believable but still a gripping, well-done  tale of savagery beneath the surface of staid bourgeoisie society","'The Hunt' takes its name from a fraternity of men in Denmark who bond over hunting. Except in the case of this film, the hunted is one of their own. Lucas is a kindergarten teacher who is having a hard time with his estranged ex-wife obtaining visitation rights in regards to their teenage son, Marcus. Things get a whole lot more difficult for Lucas when he's accused of molesting one of his nursery school pupils, little Klara, who also happens to be the daughter of his best friend and neighbor, Theo. It's all a misunderstanding as little Klara sees some picture of naked men on her brother's iPad at home. But when she arrives at school and gives Lucas a kiss on the cheek, he tells her that the kiss should be for her own parents. Klara also can't understand why Lucas won't accept a heart shaped piece of embroidery she gives him. Before you know it Klara implies that she saw Lucas' erect penis. The school director calls in a male staff member who asks Klara leading questions. Lucas is then accused of additional sexual misconduct and the accusations spread like wildfire around the town, even before the police become involved.The story becomes a cautionary tale of modern day witch hunts. Things like this have happened in the U.S., especially in cases where psychologists 'uncover' past abuse through alleged exploration of so-called repressed memories. The mere suggestion of misdeeds causes the purported victims to become convinced that criminal behavior may have occurred, when it actually did not.The nightmare escalates for Lucas when almost all his friends desert him, including Theo, who is egged on by his wife, who's now in panic mode. Lucas bitterly throws his new girlfriend, Nadja, out of his house, as she expresses doubts as to his innocence. One of the weaknesses of the story is that we never get to see Lucas interact with an attorney, nor are any of the courtroom scenes shown. Instead, another one of Lucas' best friends, Bruun, described as Marcus' 'godfather', helps with his defense. We learn that legal case against Lucas falls apart, after scores of children (after being coached by either their parents or school personnel) all accuse Lucas of sexual abuse, in the basement of his house. Police investigators, however, discover that Lucas has no basement!Despite the legal victory, Lucas remains ostracized and in two powerful scenes, he's beaten up while attempting to buy food at a supermarket and then has his beloved dog, Fanny, killed by a faceless tormentor. Lucas still has two things going for him: the love of his son, Marcus and his determination to prove his innocence.Lucas finally is able to bring most of the community back on his side when he confronts his former best friend, Theo, in church on Christmas eve. Theo was much affected beforehand, when he saw Lucas being beaten up at the supermarket. As a result of the confrontation, Theo talks with Klara, who again denies Lucas did anything wrong and he finally comes to believe Lucas' claims of innocence.I'm not completely sure if I believe that Theo would have come to accept Lucas at the end, given the community pressure as well as the fears of his own wife. After all, he could have been ostracized by the community himself. But the way it turns out, after a year has passed, somehow many (not all) have forgiven Lucas, when we see that Marcus is being accepted as an adult into the local hunting society (animal rights people bewarethis is NOT a touchy-feely movie toward animals, especially deer!). Director Thomas Vinterberg throws in a twist at the end, when an anonymous hunter takes a shot at Lucas, just to remind him that not all in the community believe in his innocence.'The Hunt' plays out highlighting the savagery lurking beneath a staid bourgeoisie society. Leaving out the legal battle on screen seems intentional, as the focus is on the errant community members, who decidedly refuse to give Lucas not one iota of a benefit of a doubt. Perhaps Vinterberg reasoned that this potboiler of a story might have ended up diluted, if he showed us a few more rational members of this community, pleading Lucas' case before the bar of justice.Nonetheless, 'The Hunt' accomplishes what it sets out to doa gripping tale of an innocent man falsely accused, fighting for himself and his way of life. Not all of it is necessarily completely believable, especially how Lucas ends up being restored to the community, through the efforts of his old friend, who finally sees the light. But that final gunshot is a tragic reminder, that not everyone is so forgiving, as Lucas' old pal, Theo."
280,The Hunt,9,23 January 2014,Have Nothing to Do With Children,"This is a great film because it tries to educate a very naïve audience--hetero parents! Every parent's fear is that there is a molester around the corner or in the house. Ever since Jon Binet, being around children is eerily uncomfortable. I personally am lucky to have no siblings or young people around me who have brats. I don't care for children. I'd have them raised on farms by strangers. I was one once. They are adults with more animal brains. They are just as conniving if not more so than adults, particularly kids who are privileged. Hetersexuals are always demonizing gays, priests, bachelor uncles to deflect what is really going on in a lot of their own homes--incest, the thing nobody wants to ever discuss. More men create harems for themselves and women create little slaves to do the bidding. Children are chattle but the pretense is love. This movie is wonderful because it puts a huge crack in the ancient dream of family. Enough with the lies. Let's be real. I loved/hated watching this film. I was angry about some of the main character's decisions until I saw the very end and it all made sense."
281,The Hunt,9,20 January 2014,Stunning,"one hell of an idea, Great Performance by: Mads Mikkelsen may be the performance of his life should have been nominated for best actor in leading role this year, Great Directing by:Thomas Vinterberg, the movie has been written carefully no wonder why the director and the writer co- operated together in writing this film, i can see this winning the Oscar this year for Best Foreign movie, the European film concepts are there, the deepness and clarity of people's personalities are Badly revealed, your suggestions about why was the movie named ""The Hunt"" will frequently come to your mind and it will also be revealed at the end, simple, complicated, stunning, moving, and one of the best movies you can see this Year."
282,The Hunt,10,15 January 2014,This is a true man,"While I was watching the movie, I keep thinking what I could possibly do if I were this man.I have been thinking that the man and I figure the character is in his 40s, so our society may had hurt him somehow already. If I were this man and at this age have such an occasion because of a lie from an innocent girl, I believe, most of us (at least me) cannot handle the delicate situation like a true man --- we may go extremes.A man should be able to bear suffering from no matter what and should behave like a real person with dignity and integrity. Basically, this is why I love this movie! What a display of true man!"
283,The Hunt,7,21 December 2013,Humanity's latent bigotry revealed,"A very ordinary tale about a very ordinary community of old friends who are driven into the fiercest bigotry by the fear of their wives for their children. One kindergarten girl is shown a pornographic picture of a hard-on by her older brother and she mentions it at school next day in connection with her favourite teacher, who is rapidly arrested, rejected by all his friends and the local community stores, beaten up and has his pet spaniel killed. All this occurs before he is cleared by the court (because all the children have referred to his misdeeds occurring in his ""basement"", which does not exist). Cut to a year later and it's all cleared up, there's a hunting party at his son's godfather's and everyone is cheerful and hugging. He goes out to see his son shoot his first deer and as he wanders through the forest, spying the deer, someone shoots at him. End of story. It's a bitter-sweet ending, showing that paedophilia charges never rub off, even when they are utterly unfounded. A small, powerful film that prompts thought, not only about adults, but also about children, and what they are willing to say. Recommended viewing."
284,The Hunt,,12 June 2013,"worth 10 , magnificent how we know the title meaning","This is a story about an important problem actually, and like this movie we need to have because it is educative, so we can know how to be with children's, and also if they can lie or not, and we don't need to judge people wrong, for many viewers they didn't understand the finish, so it means that he didn't hit the animal before and that he can't hurt an animal so he is innocent he can""t also hurt a little girl. or there are many meanings of the finish so we can say just if a movie keep us creating our finish that it is very excellent like a text and you need to give the title. So like this it kept us till the end to know the real meaning of the hunt"
285,The Hunt,9,8 April 2013,Naked portrayal of a welfare state's village people,"This movie, in a nutshell, is a depiction of typical yet pathological ignorance and unsophistication of village people, unique to some welfare state. The kids were just being kids, but the adults were no more than confused adolescents: the lack of rich verbal communication, abundant body language, asking one's hunger status and offering food to initially reach out, having no idea of the difference between some round-table discussion and arguing as in a bar fight that ought to be won, hunting and chanting drunk as the primary socialization for men, 42 year-old Lucas' phone conversation with Nadja and clumsiness having sex at home like some 16 year old, him being fixated on his routine life instead of considering leaving the village to start anew because his brain simply can't process any change... it was all there, plain and naked, like watching some wild life documentary of 2-leggeds instead of 4. Very well done.We all need more of these insiders' works from every country out there, if we want to make a healthy transition to not just a global economy but global society as well."
