0,Battle of the Sexes,,19 December 2017,A Simple Feel-good Story with some Subtlety Issues,"A light, fluffy, sweet treat, Battle of the Sexes is assuredly a crowd-pleasing movie. But much like cotton candy-the movie offers very little to digest. 
 Overall, the movie will win over most viewers with its familiar feel-good true story angle. If you liked 2016's Hidden Figures, chances are that this is a movie for you.  It strives for and ultimately achieves the classic feel-good movie moments. Hero activist beats chauvinist pig. Good triumphs over evil. Or something like that. There is no deeper exploration. There is no hard-hitting, brutal honesty. The examinations are superficial and dive no deeper than the surface. Basically, movie is too simple. But sexism and the problems that it causes are complicated. In the movie, everything is spelled out in a painfully obvious way. It condescends to make sure that everyone understands. The sexist characters come out in shameless and laughably overt ways. The good person defeats the bad person and everyone cheers. It's a fairy tale ending, hooray! But none of that is realistic. Sexist and discriminatory people in power don't publicly profess their feelings in such blunt ways. So, when the movie scenes portray characters as loud and proud sexists, I can only roll my eyes. I know the movie uses these exaggerated characters and moments to make the situation abundantly clear to the audience. I just prefer a bit of subtlety.  Instead, the movie handles the delicate, nuanced topics of sexism and repression of homosexuality with the blunt force of a lumberjack with a giant axe. Wrong professional and wrong tool. We needed a surgeon with medical instruments.  The movie still has its upside. Steve Carell and Emma Stone are charming and wonderful, which is an amazing feat considering the character that Carell plays. Bobby Riggs (Carell) flaunts his chauvinism in such a flamboyant manner that showmanship is clearly his primary focus. This is one detail that the movie gets right, thanks largely to Carell. Riggs doesn't actually believe the gross, archaic things he says about women. It's an act. He says them to attract interest in the upcoming Man vs. Woman tennis match with Billie Jean King (Stone).  The storytelling is clear, even if not always smooth. The combination of King's life-changing romance along with the battle of the sexes tennis match fit awkwardly. Though, I'm sure those two things also fit awkwardly in King's life at the time, so I accept the somewhat clumsy clash of the two storylines.
 
 Again, if you liked Hidden Figures, you will like Battle of the Sexes. It's uplifting and sends a valuable and inspiring message to young girls everywhere. On that basis, I applaud the movie. Despite its flaws, it's still a story worthy of knowing."
1,Battle of the Sexes,5,27 November 2017,Not the great tennis breakthrough movie it might have been.,"Whilst Emma Stone puts down her marker for a possible third Oscar nomination the film as a whole left me slightly cold.  But then, when did you last see a GREAT tennis movie.  That's right.  You didn't.But this potentially offered more because it appeared multi layered and could have been more nuanced than it is.It tackles two themes simultaneously.  First, Billie Jean King's lesbian relationship with her hairdresser Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough) that eventually ended in controversy as she was publicly outed by her lover when they split in 1981.  Throughout King remained married to her first love Larry (played sympathetically but a little limply by Austin Stowell).  This is handled very tastefully and, for me, was the better part of the whole.Second, and the source of the title, the movie explores sexism in the women's tennis game that led to her breaking away from the WTA and its sexist president, Jack Kramer (in an unconvincing performance by Bill Pullman), and taking on a challenge billed as THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES with 55 year old ex tennis champion and self proclaimed Male Chauvinist, Bobby Riggs (Steve Carrell).  I disliked Carell's part greatly, not because he didn't perform it well but that it is written to make him out to be a complete idiot (which no doubt he was).  He becomes a character of himself quickly and I neither liked nor disliked him (I was annoyed by him though).  It all makes for a strange mix of comedy, politics, sexuality and revolt.And the revolt was all too gentlemanly for me - despite the subject matter and the ire it must have stirred nobody really ever loses the plot and so the film lacks edge and dramatic tension.What's more, it's 30 minutes too long and the overwrought soundtrack (Nicholas Britell - it really is a shocker) is over-pervasive and just plain annoying.Emma Stone rarely puts a foot wrong in my view and at times you really do think BJK is on screen.  That part, and the general 70's styling of the movie, is excellent but it's ponderously directed and although the final shoot out between BJK and Riggs has an element of tension we all know the outcome and Britell's pomp and circumstance was gradually doing my nut in.Just because you loved Little Miss Sunshine it does not follow that you will love this."
2,Battle of the Sexes,4,28 November 2017,"The looks may be fine, but the message is very deceiving","""Battle of the Sexes"" (what the hell is up with the German title, they cannot be serious, that is really more sexist than anything or anybody in this film) is a British/American film from 2017, a very recent release, that runs for pretty much exactly 2 hours. Director are the duo from Little Miss Sunshine, the writer is an Oscar winner from Slumdog Millionaire, so quite an illustrious team. Same goes for the cast. Emma Stone is fresh off her first Oscar win while Steve Carell managed a transition from small screen to big screen in the last decade that is among the best there is. And film buffs will find many other known faces in the supporting cast too, even if you could argue that Carell is supporting too. It's too close to call for him. Shue, Armisen, Riseborough, Pullman, Silverman... and fans of Scrubs and The Good Wife will also be happy to see some stars from their shows here, even if I must say the latter, i.e. Alan Cumming is very weak sadly in here, basically a poor man's Stanley Tucci once again. And Silverman was really the worst playing a character whose in-your-face feminist approach really hurts her cause more than it helps. At least there were ideas and imagination in Stone's character, but Silverman's was really so shallow and annoying that it got unbearable to watch, even if it is probably rather the writer's fault than the actor's. The makeup/costume fit nicely there too, in a bad way that is.Now about the film itself: We have a year that gave us surprisingly 2 tennis-themed movies while other years have 0. But here it is true again too that the men provided the far better entertainment. The Shia Labeouf film about the McEnroe/Borg rivalry was on a truly high level that gave us gritty entertaining drama that was as good as it gets. This one here is the exact opposite. The tennis parts are mediocre and it's sometimes even clearly visible that the ones we see on court are not Stone and Carell. And the feminism/sexism parts that actually are at the very center of the film feel included in a way that lacks zero subtlety and shoves the message right in our faces. The way in which Margaret Court, a real champion of the sport, is depicted is something everybody working on this project should be ashamed of. The fact that she has a family and may be more conservative than the other female players was used so shamelessly against her and there is that one scene when she sees the real reason behind King's companion and ruthlessly uses it in her favor. Oh yeah, Court only won the tournament because King was struggling in her private life discovering her homosexuality and risking her marriage. But of course, Stone's character is so likable, so worth cheering for, so headstrong. Who cares she just can't be faithful to her man or at least get a divorce before having an affair. Real charmer, isn't she? I am a bit disappointed in Emma lending her name to this project. I also think her performance was nothing special at all and it was all about the looks and similarity this character offered to the real BJK that makes it memorable perhaps. The MVP is clearly Steve Carell, giving a performance that easily could have turned ridiculously bad, but did not thanks to S.C. hitting all the right notes, especially in the second hour. This is even more admirable as the character was not written too well built up as a main antagonist and then finally turned into a miserable weirdo. So Carell somewhat saved the film. The outcome eventually can be smelled from afar already and the crying scene in the dressing room afterward felt really cringeworthy as if they were trying to give the film more dramatic relevance than they had any right to. It works well together with King having egoistically sacked a commentator before the battle begins instead of showing him how it's done too with her performance. And back to the tears: If that commentator was really the bad guy and not Carell for whom it is just one big show, then why the emotional outburst? Because of the many people watching only? Hmmm I'm not buying it. But I guess, the film is easy to appreciate for those screaming sexism at Donald Trump day in and day out and those unleashing on Weinstein these days or on quality actors like Spacey, Tambor and Louis C.K. I thought the rule is innocent until proved guilty? Yep I am talking about you guys ready to give this review a thumbs-down now for saying things the way they are.Finally, my take on equal pay that plays a big role here. Have women play as much as men and they get the same amount I'd say. Which means yes for smaller tournaments where all is best-of-3, but nay for Grand Slams. Female marathon runners won't stop after 25 kilometers either. Or swim less at the Olympics. Or run 600 instead of 800 m. Enough said. Back to this movie, it is a major disappointment. Carell can only save so much here sadly. It's a shoddy, generic and stereotypical take on female's rights and an even worse take on the wonderful sport of tennis. Go for Borg/McEnroe all along. Or go for all these wonderful films about Tilden vs. Lenglen, Renshaw vs. Dodd, Connors vs. Navratilova or (the best) Braasch vs. the Williams Sisters as I truly hope these will be getting attention as well to move things in order again. This one we have here gets a thumbs-down from me, partially also for the incompetently rushed-in same-sex marriage statement at the very end between the two gay characters. Why not make it even more political if they cannot deliver in any other field at all. Not recommended."
3,Battle of the Sexes,6,22 October 2017,"Emma Stone and Steve Carell carry an uplifting, but overlong sports film","Battle of the Sexes is a an enjoyable retelling of the famous 1973 tennis match between 29-year-old Billie Jean King and 55-year-old Bobby Riggs. It was the match that sparked the women's movement in sport and planted King's status as the greatest tennis player in the world. We witness the personal journey she went though as she fought for equal rights in sports and society. Emma Stone portrays Billie Jean King as a shy and reserved opportunist who's looking to make the best of her current situation. She's a true trailblazer that's pushing for equal rights for women in sports. Steve Carell as Bobby Riggs could not be more opposite from King. He's a retired tennis champion who can't stop gambling, which frustrates his wife to the point of no return. He's also a male chauvinist who believes in the superiority of men and how women should stay in the kitchen. It couldn't be a better battle between polar opposite personalities and motives. The film follows the parallel journeys King and Riggs go through to get to their famous match. King struggles to gain equal pay for women tennis players, which eventually leads to the creation of her own women's tennis league. While traveling for matches, she discovers her homosexuality with her hairdresser, Marilyn. She's torn between her new desires and the life she already has with her husband, Larry. Riggs meanwhile is stuck in a midlife crisis and feels that his life has been missing something since he retired. He's passing his time through gambling and wants to plan a major comeback in the tennis world. Eventually their paths cross and results in one of the biggest and important sporting events in history.Clocking in at 121 minutes, the film takes its sweet time to build up King and Riggs' story. While it's interesting to see their stories unfold, it goes on for too long and drags in the middle parts just before the climactic match. The sharing of screen time is also very lopsided towards King while Riggs is treated almost like a supporting character for the first hour. Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris use their skills from Little Miss Sunshine to create a personal and emotional film. The tone of the film is pretty lighthearted and never gets too serious about the whole situation of equal rights among genders. It allows for a more feel-good sports film that is enjoyable to watch.Shot in 70's style makes the film feel closer to a television documentary than a Hollywood production. There's a grab bag of awkward close-ups, grainy images, and off-balance shots that make the film feel more authentic and grounded in reality. The famous match is recreated with stunning detail and the biggest highlight of the film. The acting is the saving grace of the film as Stone and Carell do an exceptional job portraying the real players. Golden Globe nominations will come for each of them and maybe even an Academy Award nomination for Stone. Sarah Silverman also shines as the rough and confident manager, Gladys. She plays well off Stone in the small amount of time she gets. Andrea Riseborough is solid as King's lover, Marilyn, who opens up King's hidden secrets and is the leading contributor to the emotional arc. Bill Pullman is the only person who doesn't pull of their role, as his sexist boss character is very one dimensional and almost cartoonish by the end. Battle of the Sexes is a well acted and uplifting sports film that suffers from being too slow and too long. It doesn't run as smoothly as it should, but is enjoyable enough to rank among the better sports films out there, and definitely the best tennis film."
4,Battle of the Sexes,5,5 October 2017,It Thinks It Means Well But It Really Doesn't,"A man and a woman take the stage here in 1972; the first, Billie Jean King, wins a tennis championship after a blurry match opens the titles; the second, Bobby Riggs, abandons his own family to gamble, often through his own tennis rounds. Right away, the men state how women are less publicly prevalent in tennis as men, meaning they get paid less as well. Sound familiar?Battle of the Sexes follows much truer to history than you may think allowing the real Billie Jean to oversee the production process proves the clear effort made to create a strong 21st century female role model. In the end, a fair point comes across: we need to reconsider our gamble in life.The screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy (127 Hours, Slumdog Millionaire) still has potential for another future masterpiece based on his new display of well-crafted dialogue, as his style here enables each individual to realistically talk around their lies in a clever fashion. You can sense the depth behind these conflicted words, as only whatever matters to everyone's true values gets talked about.The cast too expresses a strong desire to communicate the message about women empowerment, as most of them put in the best they could give. Oscar winner Emma Stone (Birdman, La La Land) portrays Billie Jean King with confidence to match her preparation for the role. Steve Carell (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Foxcatcher) portrays Billie Jean's ultimate rival with a considerable hardness that proves the comedian's effectiveness at drama. But I most enjoyed one of the smaller roles, Natalie Morales, who plays Billie Jean's stuck-up authoritative agent. Unfortunately, some of the male actors destroyed the perfect performance streak, particularly Austin Stowell, who plays Billie Jean's husband, and Alan Cumming, who plays a stereotypical British assistant thrown in mostly for comic relief. So sadly, not everyone in the cast and crew was truly passionate about its message of gender superiority.In fact, almost nobody of redeemable quality supports the message's potential positive value. In essence, we don't even meet Billie Jean's husband until the midway point, which ends up feeling extremely joyless since beforehand, we see her sexual attraction toward her lesbian hairdresser come out in a moment of embracing and unzipping in a dark, steamy motel room. At this rate, why would I want to see an unfaithful wife succeed in her desire for fame and fortune?As for Bobby, he appears to be nothing besides a depiction of the era's public mindsetan unmotivated woman hater. The balance in telling his story all throughout the feature is barely even there, as editor Pamela Martin (The Fighter, Little Miss Sunshine) leaves too long stretches of time away from Bobby's subplot. Even his climactic tennis match against the famed female star lacks any tension on his behalf, since no details are learned about what tennis means to either combatant.The directorial appearance in particular lacks any artistic quality, from Emma Stone's fake black wig to needing to play ""Where's Waldo"" on the screen. What do I mean by that? Well, the two directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine) unintentionally make you search harder than necessary to find the character talking. Their lack of screen control plays its greatest toll in the end, when the legendary match is viewed from far away into the audience bleachers, consequently ruining the intimacy of tennis. The cinematographer, Linus Sandgren, just won the Oscar last year for his colorful live action daydream, La La Land, but now his Steadicam work takes a massive step back into dull indie movie mode.In the long run, the extreme preachiness may turn you off the most, since it forcefully tells you to accept its worldview on gender superiority. Similar to various feminist propaganda such as Thelma & Louise, Erin Brockovich, Frozen, Wonder Woman, and countless others, men are painted to look like the predators responsible for women's problems, which in this circumstance devalues heterosexual relationships and diminishes love to impulsive selfishness. Why do so many message films have to force such one-sided, surfacey conclusions? These events may have actually happened, yet the depiction of her affair straight up degrades straight married people. Bobby's marriage appears problematic until his wife decides to change in a submissive fashion, while Billie Jean's sole roadblock in her newfound love is her current husband? Give me a break.Although my parents and I felt disappointed after walking out of the theater together, it led us into a rather in-depth discussion about our current treatment towards the LGBTQ community. Therefore, we as viewers ought to talk about these crucial ideas more, as listening to one another will help us realize the true blinded difference between the sexes."
5,Battle of the Sexes,6,7 October 2017,Losing The Forest For The Trees,"There is no doubt that the event on which ""Battle of the Sexes"" is based on was a monumental moment in sports and cultural history. The exhibition tennis match between Bobby Riggs & Billie Jean King was in part a circus, but also (in large part) a key moment in the taking of women athletes seriously on the national stage. While this film eventually arrives at that point, I felt like it took far too long for it to ""get to the point"", so to speak.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of the run-up to the Battle of the Sexes match. Riggs (Steve Carell) is a male chauvinist through and through (or at least plays the role of one), while King (Emma Stone) is perhaps the premiere women's tennis player of her era. While King struggles with her confusing sexuality and Riggs falls on hard times with his own wife, this sets the wheels in motion for a match that will be more than just an exhibition, as it seemingly carries with it the weight of the Women's Liberation movement of the 1970s.Let me be clear about one thing: This isn't a ""bad"" movie by any stretch. Great acting performances are given, and the final 30 minutes are fully riveting. I completely understood and appreciated the message that was being conveyed.That being said, the entire film is predicated on the notion that the setup (e.g. the first 70-80 minutes or so) of both lead figures will lead to more dramatic payoff in the end. For me, that didn't happen (in fact, it actually had the opposite effect). I'm not sure that King's sexual leanings needed to be a focal point of the story, and in Riggs' case his relationship with his wife (played by Elisabeth Shue) should have been developed even more. Because neither of these things really get on track, at least the first half of the film felt slow and stodgy to me.Once the match is set and the buildup/execution of it begins, though, the film really shines. I only have video footage to go on here (I was not alive for the real thing), but Stone is sometimes a dead-ringer for King on the court. Carell's antics as Riggs were also accurate from what I have read/heard.So, while being a solid film, I cannot give ""Battle of the Sexes"" more than just above-average marks for the lackluster opening acts. I felt like a different lens was needed (or the execution of the chosen lens needed to be better) in order to make the movie truly riveting in the end instead of ""just"" somewhat inspirational. It never got to that ""next level"" for me (aside from the material about the actual match itself)."
6,Battle of the Sexes,1,11 October 2017,"Not the worst movie, but close.","This was an awful movie with gross items and topics that overplayed the tennis match climax into an LGBTQ movie that if known at the time 0 people would have been watching this match in support of King. This was written mostly from King's view and simply is not accurate. This movie is about how the rich and the famous hide behind their fame and in truth showed Larry (King's wife) not divorcing his wife just for the fame and money when he found she was unfaithful. President Obama bless his heart awarded King for her being LGBTQ, and not for the actual winning of a man that was out of shape and just putting on a show. Warning.. Don't let your kids watch this or you can say goodbye to their values."
7,Battle of the Sexes,1,2 October 2017,Absolute Liberal Feminist Trash,"You will want to hurt yourself if you watch this movie. It is so untrue and suggests ridiculous things about the human race that separates us instead of uniting. This actually made me lose some hope in all of us. This movie had very little character development aside from describing Billie Jean King in a strong liberal political view. The entire movie suggests it is a true story, but it makes up many ridiculously exaggerated events and quotes."
8,Battle of the Sexes,6,10 October 2017,"Battle of the Sexes may have scored some points, but it hogs it's own ball by focusing too much on Billie Jean King","In the sporting world, most women unfortunately get the short end of the deal. Women have shown that they are just as athletic and strong as any man. It all comes down to biology and that whoever posses the greater ability is going to triumph. It can be men, but women just have enough chance. Sports in no different, but that environment has been a male dominated area for a long time. From the early days of the Ancient Greek Olympic games to the modern NFL, the doors were open to all men, but women have always been led to their own segregated event, or even told not to try.The second half of the twentieth century gave in to the rise of feminism as society further accepted the role the women would play. The workforce, science, and even politics would see their fair share of women pioneers, but when it came to sports, this was still seen as a mans game. In the 1970s, a group of women athletes tried to change things by not only starting their own tennis organization, but helped set up a match to prove their ability to equal the men. This is all done in Battle of the Sexes. Tennis star Billie Jean King (played by Emma Stone) has made a big name for herself, having won the Grand Slam Championships along with the US Open and Wimbledon, and all by the age of twenty-nine. Though despite her name, she finds out that she and every other female tennis athlete were making thousands less the men, all because of their gender. She asks for an equal pay from the executive director of the Association of Tennis Professionals Jack Kramer (played by Bill Pullman) but is denied. In defiance, she and several other women tennis players quit the circuit to start their own series of tournaments.Meanwhile, former tennis star Bobby Riggs (played by Steve Carell) is dealing with his compulsive gambling and still seeks attention from the media. To boast his image and the sport of tennis, he pitches to Billie Jean King an exhibition match where the two would play, and ""show why men are better athletes"". Though aware it's a publicity stunt, Billie turns him down. In 1973, Billie is again pitched, but this time accepts for the sake of her fellow athletes. At the same time however, she is going through personal troubles as she begins an affair with her hairdresser Marilyn (played by Andrea Riseborough).Given a lot of the controversial political trouble that the U.S. has been going through, Battle of the Sexes seems to be made at the right time. A tennis match between two different ideologies seems to summarize a lot of the thoughts and concerns people are having with the future. I'd say that overall, not all of the game was played right. What I mean is that while the movie as a whole promises a fair share, the story seems to be one sided with Billie Jean King.Both Emma Stone and Steve Carell play their characters fine enough. I can see why Emma Stone would be attracted to this part after winning her Oscar for La La Land; it shows how much a personal issue could affect an athlete's mental game. She is interesting and you do want her to see her prevail her cause. Steve Carell may seem to going back to comedic roots that could be seen as hammy, but understand that Bobby Riggs had a large personality that would require a Steve Carrel. I just wished the movie would have given us more time to explore that part of his character.Like the title of this movie, everything leads up to the match. The problem is that while I like the events that lead us there, the movie doesn't seem to be interested in the Bobby Riggs side. I wonder if the original script was originally a Billie Jean Kings biopic that was rewritten to be about this match and the controversies surrounding this. This leads into a movie that means well, but is structurally uneven with its tone. This will surely be a movie that will be championed for it's positive look on female athletes, but for those that want to look into the history of The Battle of the Sexes, there must be some books about it that tell the story better.I'll give it six tennis balls out of ten. I cannot dismiss the movie completely as when it tells Billie Jean King's story, I liked it. I just wish that Bobby Riggs had gotten a fairer portrayal. I'd say if your going to see this, look into the facts and people behind the actual Battle of the Sexes first. Do all of that, and see if the balls in your court."
9,Battle of the Sexes,1,17 September 2017,When Billie Beat Bobby was much better and 30 minutes shorter,"The only thing that this film has that the television didn't is a bigger budget and not hiding Billie's sexuality. The screenplay is mediocre and doesn't really capture the 1970's. The television film also has much better actors and better screenplay. Both films deal with the sexism the was women had to endure more in the 1970's. However this film does show that women were getting 1/2 the money men were getting playing the same sport. Emma Stone is fine in the role of Billie. Steve Carell has makes a caricature out of Bobby Riggs and not really show his ""human side"". Yes Bobby was a real life cartoon but for a film that runs 30 minutes longer than its television counterpart it could of done a better job. If you are looking for a good film to watch KEEP LOOKING"
10,Battle of the Sexes,,30 September 2017,Forced and Awkward,"This movie is about how Billie Jean King cheated on her loving husband with her lesbian hairdresser. The filmmaker apparently thinks you're supposed to overlook adultery because... I don't know, LGBTQ something?Billie Jean's husband may be the only not flawed character, and he's apparently supposed to be... what? the bad guy? I came to see a movie of women's empowerment and I somehow found myself almost rooting for Bobby Riggs, especially since they made a point to say his chauvinism was just for show. Given that it's an actual historical event I'm glad Billie Jean won, but I mean damn. Seriously, what was the point of making Billie Jean a cheater? The whole movie just felt awkward and forced. I look forward to a women's empowerment movie that doesn't somehow accidentally make women the villain of the story."
11,Battle of the Sexes,9,7 September 2017,The match of the century,"There may have been some slight deviations from the real events in part ...however, Carell does a fine job of recreating the 1-man flying circus that was Bobby Riggs and Emma Stone provides a fine performance as one of the most influential Americans of the last century. The history is well worth seeing again. One can only imagine the immense pressure on King at a time when women were paid a mere pittance in professional tennis compared to men regardless of the equality of ticket sales for men's and women's matches.. King took on an iconic institution ...organized ... and prevailed. She refused to be bullied and intimidated by USLTA (now USTA) overlord, Jack Kramer and anyone else who opposed equality. For those who were intending to see a film entirely about one of the major sporting events in the last century...one tennis match watched by 90 million worldwide viewers in the US and 36 countries ....perhaps they would have preferred to see more about the wheeling and dealing that led to the epic in the Houston Astrodome and less about her personal relationships and coming to terms with her sexuality. Nonetheless, coping with all these pressures in the time period only added to the stature of Billie Jean King. Most other humans would have collapsed under the pressure. After all, Riggs had just beaten the world's #1 woman player in May quite easily, 6-2, 6-1. But King won the high-pressure match in 3 sets. And continued the battle for equality for all Americans. in Bobby Riggs defense, it was all an act for him. He loved women and actually he and Billie became good friends following the match until his death in 1995. For whatever complaints critics may have re the direction or writing etc...the telling of the story of this battle for economic and social justice...and for new audiences to gain awareness of what occurred in the 1970s about an event that captured the nation and took it by storm....well worth it!"
12,Battle of the Sexes,5,5 November 2017,Emma Stone and Steve Carell,"really shine. It is a pity that Carell and Stone did not play do a movie with a more distinct script. The plot of the Battle is much too thin to take me away. Feminist fight for equal rights is always a bit obscure, if it is connected to people who are already famous and can do what they want, anyway. Make a feminist movie of e.g. a cleaning woman in the 60's and I am sure Emma Stone could make another Oscar performance."
13,Battle of the Sexes,5,2 October 2017,It's about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump! GET IT?!?!,"I'm getting torn between the work of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Farris, and ultimately their latest BATTLE OF THE SEXES. Obtaining a firm grasp of visual storytelling and great performances but a clear ailment in general writing, they always attempt to offer grounded and smart comedies that always aim to coincide with current sociopolitical issues. But as of now, it's met with mixed results; even far from perfect, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE succeed in capturing the aspiring yet hopeless American zeitgeist, but also turn out to be a funny and charming road trip comedy. But then there's RUBY SPARKS, a Charlie Kaufman wannabe film that attempts to subvert the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope in male-written narratives with confused and often embarrassing results.Now with BATTLE OF THE SEXES, they opted to recreate the Tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Briggs, but frame it in a well-intentioned but totally obvious angle. Yes folks, they made a movie about the 2016 Presidential Debate. And yes, it ends declaring that the woman will win. Anyone wants to say ""too soon""?Representing the careless liberal hubris during which the film was written, BATTLE OF THE SEXES depicts the documented marketing strategy of the famous game in which the spirited and determined Emma Stone must beat the power-hungry, chauvinistic Steve Carell in order to gain more appropriation for the women who play the sport. And considering what REALLY went down during the election, saying all that makes me even more depressed.It's just naked choir-preaching, and yet still makes me conflicted. To be clear, I'm totally against chauvinism and believe that the message of the film does hold some merit. But at the same token, outside of preachy, it leaves the rest of the script underdeveloped. The story jumps back and forth between scenes with no rhythm, the dialogue spells everything out where it doesn't need to, the lesbian subplots with King and a hair stylist barely takes off, and Riggs family life and gambling issues never get resolved. It breezes the very compelling, character-building side stories just to prattle on about how much men are pigs and women are better. Again, a message I'm ALL FOR, just not in a way it's presented here.Still, all that aside, I do find a lot more merit in this than RUBY SPARKS. Emma Stone is incredible as King, and while the misogynist jokes got old fast, Steve Carell still owns as Riggs. There are ways in which dialogue is restraint for clever storytelling cues that I really liked, and the setting looks nicely retro. And yes, like the directors old films, they do offer a pretty compelling climax with the actual game.BATTLE OF THE SEXES is frustratingly biased and unfocused, but I'm compelled to like it more. It's not airtight as LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, but thankfully not as icky or off-the-rails as RUBY SPARKS. And it goes without saying that the gals going into this need some sort of pick-me-up what with the shitty year they're going through, so that's a plus. Still, I say they still deserve more."
14,Battle of the Sexes,3,21 December 2017,What a letdown.,2 actors I really like not delivering. Steve Carell's recycled voice from anchorman is forced to a new height. All men are assholes or idiots. Lot's of good support actors reduced to one-liners. Don't know what happened here. I was ready for a good movie. On paper it is a good movie. It just didn't work out.
15,Battle of the Sexes,7,6 October 2017,"A Doll's House Re-visited, Almost","The themes presented in this film are still relevant and have merit. With that said, I want to add that ever since Ibsen wrote ""A Doll's House,"" it's very rare to get a film (or play for that matter) that is charged with the theme of gender equality and presents it in a way that truly resonates. What do I mean? In films that aim to give a message or present an issues, such as when the writer wants to say something about the relevant society, more often than not, the writer portrays those characters in simple categorizations of good and bad. That may work in a superhero film, but in a piece of realism, where character development and relationships are key elements to the storytelling, simple good and bad just won't do. That's my issue with this film. The screenplay simplifies a few integral characters too much, in favor of hoisting up its protagonist.To get this out of the way, the performances are fantastic. Emma Stone and Steve Carell lead the cast well, and the cast doesn't have a weak link in it. In particular, a lot of credit has to be given to Steve Carell. He took a character that was underwritten and perhaps even misrepresented and makes him sympathetic and someone to root for. Andrea Riseborough also delivers a very affecting performance and really gives us some great scene work with Emma Stone.The directing is swift, well paced and well filmed. Kudos to the cinematographer who really has a wonderful grasp on stillness to promote an essential moment and exerts great uses of soft and hard focus to portray dramatic moments and internalize character feelings. The editing also deserves a shout out for some wonderful pacing and really effectively switching between the grainy, 70s like cinematography and more clear cinematography.Now, back to the screenplay. What made and still makes ""A Doll's House"" the ultimate gender-equality script is that every character can be sympathized with. We learn more about the human condition and evils of society, rather than placing blame and anger on individual groups. There are only two men that can be rooted for without hesitation and that's our protagonist's husband and father. Every other guy is completely unlikable and has no arc, and Steve Carell's character can be questioned. Carell's character, who is a vital part of this story, isn't written very well or thoroughly. It's always hard to have two protagonists in a film, especially at a reasonable and well paced time. Carell's character is both an antagonist and protagonist or, at least attempts to be so. Carell's character opposes Emma Stone's. It's a man versus women ordeal and their tennis match is the crisis and climax of the film. But, here's the issue. Carell's character is NOT the antagonist. It's society! So why is Carell's character's standing within the realm of the film so questionable? Why doesn't he get his own arc? Every major character in ""A Doll's House"" takes a journey. That's what makes us empathize with them and come away disliking their society, and not the products of that society. The same would work with this film. But instead, there is a co- protagonist / antagonist that is not written for people to care about or even empathize with. He gets no arc, no change. He's unaffected. He may as well have been a smaller part.Why is this an issue? Because Emma Stone's character is a catalyst. She's the driving force and vehicle used within the film to represent the affects of an unjust era and to showcase the positive effects that a change in this society would have. Unfortunately, because Carell's character and the real antagonists (the sexists who sit atop the societal ladder) don't change, because we only see them as unlikable, this story turns into something simple and ultimately un-fulfilling. Stone's character merely wins the battle within the film and we come away knowing that and are momentarily happy. However, that soon goes away, which makes this entertaining dramedy perhaps a little forgettable. Had the writing been more substantial and caring to all its characters, and forgiving to all its characters and condemned society instead, we'd come away with a more profound understanding of where issues lie and are issued from. That's a memorable film. I suppose the cinematic world is still chasing Ibsen. I give this film 3 out of 5 stars for its entertainment value and performances and recommend it for ages 13 to 18.

16,Battle of the Sexes,9,19 December 2017,"Tennis and Sex, but without the grunting.","Here's a good test of someone's age.... ask the question ""Billie-Jean?"". Millennials will probably come back with ""Huh?""; those in their 30's or 40's might come back with ""Michael Jackson!""; those older than that will probably reply ""King!"".""Battle of the Sexes"" tells the true-life story of US tennis star Billie-Jean King (Emma Stone, ""La La Land""). The year is 1973 and Billie-Jean is riding high as the Number 1 female tennis player. She is a feminist; she is married (to hunk Larry - no not that one - King played by Austin Stowell (""Whiplash"", ""Bridge of Spies"")); ... and she is also attracted to women, not something she has yet acted on. That all changes when her path crosses with LA-hairdresser Marilyn (Andrea Riseborough, ""Birdman"", ""Oblivion"").But this is a side story: the main event is a bet made by aging ex-star Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell, ""Foxcatcher""); that - even at his age - as a man he could beat the leading female tennis player of the day.The film is gloriously retro, starting with the old-school 20th Century Fox production logo. And it contains breathtakingly sexist dialogue by writer Simon Beaufoy (""Everest"", ""The Full Monty""). Surely men couldn't have been so crass and outrageous in the 70's? Sorry ladies, but the answer is yes, and the film is testament to how far women's rights have come in 50 years. This is a tour de force in acting from both Emma Stone and Steve Carell, particularly the latter: a scene where Carell tries to re-engage with his estranged wife (Elisabeth Shue, ""Leaving Las Vegas"") is both nuanced and heart-breaking. Stone's performance is also praiseworthy, although it feels slightly less so as it is an impersonation of a (relatively) well-known figure: this is extremely well-studied though, right down to her strutting walk around the court which I had both forgotten and was immediately again reminded of. One of my favourite movie awards are the Screen Actor's Guild (SAG) ""cast"" awards that celebrate ensemble performances, and here is a film that should have been nominated (it unfortunately wasn't). Andrea Riseborough; Natalie Morales (as fellow tennis player Rosie Casals); comedian Sarah Silverman (""A Million Ways to Die in the West""), almost unrecognisable as the brash publicist Gladys Heldman; Bill Pullman as LTA head Jack Kramer; the great Alan Cumming (""The Good Wife"") as the team's flamboyant, gay, costume designer; Lewis Pullman as Riggs's son Larry; Jessica McNamee (magnetic eyes!) as King's Australian tennis nemesis Margaret Court. All bounce off the leads, and each other, just beautifully.Cinematography by Linus Sandgren (""La La Land"") and editing by Pamela Martin (""Little Miss Sunshine"") unite to deliver one of the most sexually charged haircuts you are ever likely to see on the screen. For those put off by this aspect of the storyline, the ""girl-on-girl action"" is pretty tastefully done and not overly graphic: it's mostly ""first-base"" stuff rather than ""third-base""!Directed with panache by the co-directors of the 2006 smash ""Little Miss Sunshine"" - Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris - all in all it's a delight, especially for older audiences who will get a blast of nostalgia from days when sports were still played at a slightly more leisurely pace... and definitely without the grunting.(For the graphical review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

18,Battle of the Sexes,1,24 December 2017,Misuse of one of the greatest sports for humanity degradation from civilization junk,"As former professional tennis player, coach, engineer have to write few words and ask few questions. Why somebody forces this idea of ""Battle of sexes"" when we have totally different natural interests ? Why you haven't made movie of Serena Williams, best female tennis player losing badly from the guy from public after his challenge and provocation even with all forbidden substances she was taking all the time? Why is price money same for ATP and WTA tournaments when rating of WTA is 8 times lower than ATP is even with those 95% of maniacs watching only female tennis everybody knows why? I think somebody is trying to degrade family and they thinks they are so smart they can runs this civilization their own way buy making chaos, wars and convincing women they are so smart, and making propaganda of gay, lesbians and imbeciles. Tennis as the sports suffers a lot last years and decades and only with effort of players it is still standing. Tennis is nobodies, it is product of human part of civilization and thats why it will survive at the end of the day.USA has honest and brave citizens and it deserves much more then it is becoming now. Sports has become the mean for world political battle and as it gets worse all sports are on larger pressure.I don't think that any actor accept role if they don't see any purpose or point of the movie more then only making money. I have question for them. What is the point of this movie and their IQ, all together ? Their colleagues know them very and who has conscience and who is not. Now we all know as well so m rating is 1 for this movie, and 0 for all next this actors may come in because I will just pass them."
19,Battle of the Sexes,8,2 October 2017,Great serve for entertainment and equality,"Battle of the Sexes is an old fashioned, sensitive, crowd pleasing film that never feels outdated. The only downside is how fact & fiction portrayed in Battle of the Sexes almost feels like a documentary.As I was watching Battle of the Sexes, a part of me felt ashamed that attitudes towards women sports, equal pay and rights haven't made giant steps since 1973.From the opening frames, Billy Jean King (beautifully played by Emma Stone) is fighting against US Lawn Tennis Association for equal pay; men's single prize money is $12,000 and women's single prize money is $1,200. Billy is asking for equal pay but the male bosses reject her plea; they believe the men's tennis has bigger names, higher quality and draws bigger crowds  despite woman's tennis games drawing the same crowds. Battle of the Sexes isn't about tennis but the universal fight to be freed from the shackles of outdated societal values. Directors Valerie Faris & Johnathan Dayton and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy use the well-worn underdog, sports template to winning effect; repellent villains, training montages, back room deals and typical last-minute setbacks are knowingly included (although this did happen in real life). Despite the sport movie clichés, the filmmakers manage to find space for moments of real sensitivity; Billy Jean's self-exploration or Bobby consoling his wife, the tension is felt on both sides.Considering how many high-profile male politicians and public figures have been rightly criticised for their attitude towards women, the film could've taken the easy step to make bobby Riggs a real chauvinistic monster. Credit to Carell and Beaufoy for not descending Riggs into a caricature; he's clown, showman and compulsive gambler who you may perversely believe that he helped Women's Tennis Association in stature.From the 16mm film stock, the sun-dried visuals and music choices; this is a wonderfully romantic film, embracing love in every form and wearing its modern-day parable with pride. Despite BOTS relevant themes, this never feels preachy or one-note while becoming an incredibly entertaining movie.Whether you are voting yes or no in the current plebiscite, I have no doubt anyone watching Battle of the Sexes will be air punching their way to the end and hopefully feel the need to change the world. That's what great entertainment can do; make people unaware they're embracing an disagreeable ideal without realizing it."
20,Battle of the Sexes,6,2 October 2017,The Most Millennial Movie,"If I could give this film an alternate title I'd call it ""Gay: The Movie"". It was everything a millennial would want to see: LGBTQ causes, women's rights, Jewish people, and cigarettes!Firstly the good: this had a stellar cast - Sarah Silverman did a superb job of portraying a serious character. There are so many TV and film greats that pop up all throughout the movie.Now the bad: this wasn't a movie about tennis. It wasn't even about women's rights. It had plenty of homosexual tension, and I mean plenty, like if you missed it the first time we'll just linger longer and longer and longer on that theme. And then throw in more of that theme. And more.This wasn't a movie about 1973. Too many technology fails for that. And over-exaggerated everything, from clothing to opinions. Maybe this is based somehow on a historical event but it would be described as loose at best and quite a fiction at that.This wasn't a movie about female greats - you couldn't miss the vilification of Australia's great female tennis player, or the shaming of men filmed back in the day holding, what was then, majority acceptable views.So what was this movie about, exactly? I'm not sure - and if it wasn't for the clever cinematography and the amazing sizeable cast - I think it wouldn't have had any entertainment value at all - unless I was 17 and felt it confirmed the political views of my friends.I'm sure setting a movie back in the past is a wonderful vehicle for promoting cigarettes - such an important theme of this movie along with the carefully placed names of big tobacco companies that are most definitely around today.It's also a wonderful vehicle for rewriting history - and shaming anybody who was a part of that time.But be careful, kids, movies in 40 years are going to be all about how you were the shameful person because the views you hold today won't be what is acceptable in the future!"
21,Battle of the Sexes,1,5 January 2018,Women...GOOD! Men...BAD!,"Best movie I've ever seen, by far!YOU GO GIRLS!But...oh oh oh, those nasty villainous men, and their nasty and villainous men's ways! Oh the audacity! (Overt masculinity is cancer, if you didn't know)So, now that I've done my daily male-incited stress cleansing (followed by a few minutes of personal female-scented affirmation), we can get to the meat of the review.This film represents a period where a large step forward, towards achieving our ultimate goals, was taken. And don't all journeys start with the first step? Step by step, year by year, we are winning the battle. I certainly would have liked to see it happen much sooner, but despite the many decades of struggle, it's finally nearly here! And what sort of future do I mean?Let's break it down:Men: WILL be either submissive worshipers of our soon-to-be-obvious superiority, or they will be gay (and therefore loads of fun to hang out with). Any other male stereotypes will be socially and culturally deemed as undesirable and of lower status, and will rightly be heavily discriminated against. Like the husband in this film, any future man learning of an infidelity by his wife will not only tolerate it, but after a brief adjustment period, will encourage it. ATTABOY!Women: Can finally be free to do what they want, when they want, how they want, with whom they want, and never again face any consequences. Anything negative said towards a woman, regardless of the circumstances, shall be treated as the equivalent of someone denying the Holocaust. Not only won't it be tolerated, but our goal is to make it a punishable offense. It will be nothing less than a legitimate HATE CRIME! Additionally, all so-called Supermodels will be required, by law, to carry a minimum body weight far exceeding current ""plus-size"" models. (I myself, am 275 pounds, and I legitimately believe I am overwhelmingly beautiful, and WILL be adored, respected, and desired...despite the fact I've literally done nothing worthy of adoration, respect, or desire. I AM A GODDESS...by virtue of my gender!!!)Kids: Will also be free to do as they please. With their inherent desire towards ""individuality"" via subversive (but still very trendy) outlets, due to how easily influenced their under-developed and childish minds are, will loudly declare themselves transgendered (if it suits them), and proudly wear their tacky green hair as an expression of solidarity! GO GENDER FLUIDITY!Honestly, I couldn't be any more pleased with the direction things are going. Lucky for us, Topical Cultural Influence (TCI) will beat the crap out of Common Sense in a street-fight, even if (the rather elderly) Common Sense is being backed up by its equally-old buddy, Mr. Logic. Such a two-on-one brawl will still end up with those two bleeding on the sidewalk, with black eyes for a week, and possibly a broken hip. Cause TCI is an MMA fighter on steroids! Plus, in the odd event that TCI needs backup, it's got buddies too. And they are tough as nails. Ignorance and conformity will gladly jump into the scrap, and viciously support and defend TCI. Those are some strong-azz friends to have, and they are on OUR SIDE, pigs!So take notice, men! The old ways will no long be accepted. You simply cannon contain that which has been repressed in (some) people for a very long time. The pendulum has, can, and WILL swing hard the other way!In the near future, the only time you'll hear about accusations of ""inappropriate behavior"" or ""misconduct"" from a famous person, is when it's directed at women perpetrators! Which, of course, will be largely ignored. What, did you not read about the pendulum a moment ago? Former subjugation has its benefits!I HAS SPOKEN!(lastly, don't forget: national ""Kick a Man"" day is coming up three Sundays from now. Put on some Nancy Sinatra and get busy, girls!)"
22,Battle of the Sexes,1,2 January 2018,Gay obsession,This trash film is just another load of shite jumping on the modern bandwagon of 'gay sex' obsessed pervert sickos.
23,Battle of the Sexes,7,25 September 2017,A Film Made With Care And Heart,"True stories are always tampered with when trying to create a feature film. Sometimes that's for the better and sometimes it's for the worse, but it's usually done in order to make a great film, rather than relying on spilling information to the audience. Battle of the Sexes is the latest upcoming film to receive this treatment, and while I'm not very familiar with the material it's based on, I found myself really enjoying these characters on-screen. Whether or not they accomplished a spot-on depiction of them, it matters if the film ends up being good or not. Upon reflection, this is about a solid as you can get with a story that's fairly specific about its messages. This is a very well made movie that will be remembered for its great performances. Here is why I would recommend Battle of the Sexes. Billie Jean King (a world-class tennis player) is challenged by Bobby Riggs (the current champion) and after deciding this is the best move for her career, the two prepare for the match of the century. That's the simple premise of this film, but the underlying messages of feminism and whether or not women should've been giving equal rights to play in a sport that many believed they couldn't do as wells men is definitely worth putting up on the big screen. Sure, there are moments throughout this film that many my find preachy, but there really isn't another way to get the point across without coming off that way. I thought this story was presented with care and honesty. If for nothing else, Steve Carell and especially Emma Stone should surely be remembered for their performances here. Although nothing spectacular in terms of breaking out in tears or screaming for an Oscar, their subtle nuances that they add to their characters are really what made this film work for me. Battle of the Sexes is a film that needed to be made, but it's one of those movies that relies heavily on whether or not you believe in what the actors are saying. I was sucked into this story and found myself relaxed throughout the first two acts and slowly getting on the edge of my seat by the time the film reached its climax. As mentioned above, this is a film that builds up to a tennis match to end all tennis matches (so to speak), but it's really not about the match at all. It's really just a matter of whether or not a woman can stand up to a man in the court, regardless of the outcome. I found this aspects to be very moving and it's what made me enjoy this film as much as I did. Yes, the match itself is well done, but its really not that intense, because by the time the match begins, the point of the film has already been made. In the end, Battle of the Sexes is a well-written screenplay that's translated quite well to the big screen. Having very, very good performances that deliver a solid message about how far we've come as a society in terms of gender equality, this is always a relevant topic. All of that being said, I feel as though this film could've been much stronger. I enjoyed this film from start to finish, but it really does just exist to get that message across. It's a good movie that could've been great if it took a few more chances. I can recommend it to everyone in order to pick up on all of the eye- opening messages, but once you've seen this film, I can't see much re-watch value. Battle of the Sexes is a solid watch with a great message, but that's about it."
24,Battle of the Sexes,6,6 October 2017,A tennis movie that's not really about tennis,"The hardest thing about making one of these historical biopics is that everyone already knows exactly what happened. As I watched it with my mom, she would intermittently remind me that she did, in fact, watch the match happen when she was about 7 years old, and I'm sure many of the older folks in the theater remember it much more vividly. I just want to know, was the match in the film exciting for them at all?I mean, we all knew what was gonna happen, but I feel like having actually watched the match while it was really happening with no actual idea of who was gonna win is just way more exciting and could never compare to the film. That's why I'm glad the movie wasn't really about the match. It was more about Billie and Bobby. No one walked into this movie wondering who is gonna win the match. They went to see it to find out about the people who were playing it.One of them, as it turns out, was having a steamy lesbian affair with their hairdresser, and the others' marriage was being torn apart by a gambling addiction. The way the movie showcases the two players' secret lives is done well, but not amazingly, especially with Bobby Riggs. He has approximately 2 scenes with him and his wife, and it doesn't sell their relationship well. It sells it so poorly in fact, that at one point Rigg's wife actually has to remind him why she loves him in the first place. We get hints that she is mad at him with a classic clothes-out-the-window scene, but Elizabeth Shue plays Pricilla so unaffectedly that it really seems like she could care less, even when confessing her love for him. Their whole dynamic feels a bit forced and unsubstantial. Rigg's addiction problem is pretty hilarious to watch though, especially when he whips out a deck of cards at his gambler's anonymous meeting, proclaiming that they're not here because they're gamblers, they're here because they're bad gamblersBillie Jean and Marilyn's story is much more interesting. After one of the more intimate, beautifully shot and well-acted haircuts I've seen in a long time, Billie starts to feel a certain kinda way towards her hairdresser Marilyn, leading to a steamy romance. Is cheating on your husband a good thing? No. Is discovering your sexual preferences important? Yes. Basically, I'm torn. They have great on screen chemistry and I want to root for them, but cheating is bad, I guess. The movie doesn't really make clear what it wants you to think about Billie's affair, especially when Billie's husband Larry finds out about it (within his first 10 minutes on screen) and still is supportive of her up to the match.My one big gripe, though, is the fact that the final act of the movie is literally a tennis match. It's a great tennis match don't get me wrong, but if I wanted to watch Billie Jean King vs. Bobby Riggs, I could have looked the match up on Youtube. Now obviously, they could not have just excluded the match from the film, but they fail to add ANY context to it that watching it on Youtube couldn't already provide. All we see is the two of them facing off, with frequent cuts to random characters reacting. It all just feels pointless. A good sports movie should take you behind the scenes to what you can't see with the telecast. I suppose that's an inherent problem with tennis movies. What you see is, for the most part, what you get. Luckily, the move doesn't dwell on the match itself for too long.After King emerges victorious in the face-off, Alan Cumming's Ted, the gay best friend, delivers a VERY not subtle moral to the story. Something along the lines of ""one day we'll be able to be who we want to be and love who we want to love."" So is this movie about women? Is it about lesbians? Is it about cheating? I don't know. It's kind of about all of those and also kind of about none of those. It's really just about a person who, with the whole world against her, overcame adversity and proved that she was stronger than anyone thought. So, it's a sports movie. A sports movie that just so happens to involve a lesbian affair. It's kind of a strange film if you think about it. Strange, but still pretty good. I recommend it if you're a fan of tennis, or feminism."
25,Battle of the Sexes,4,29 September 2017,Games Create Dialogue,"A social war finds a battleground on artificial turf. A gender divide now separated by a waist-high net. The membrane is soft, but absolute. The positioning of the opponents, which were once stagnant, now alternate between sets. Equality resides over the battle dome, but fairness can always be exploited. Billie Jean on the top of her craft, yet her compensation remains laughable. A soul just as dedicated to her game as any of her male counterparts, she sighs and forgets her way through most corporate meetings. She is the face of women's tennis, and soon will be the face of women's liberation.Bobby has tasted the victory Billie Jean presently basks in, but his conquering took place in a more rigid time. The seventies are disrupting the national psyche, and leaders bloom from unlucky gardens. The flowers and stars laced into the tennis dresses proclaim an uprising of feminine strength that no longer curls up in the face of ridicule.Taking a seat in the back row of a gamblers anonymous meeting, Bobby knows he has no problems. The only reason why he finds himself in this church basement is because he was caught gambling. He even plays phony blackjack with his shrink. Betting is inherent to his personality, and integral to his character. His affinity for flair unlocks magical opportunities. Even his bigoted persona will aid the war effort of equal rights in a very roundabout way.Slumbering in a nondescript hotel bed, Billie Jean has abandoned the Grand Slam for a greater prize. She has gone rogue, and now feels more expressive than ever. Her competitors are lousy enemies and phenomenal friends. Tournaments give appropriate recognition to those who bleed during their construction. She remains content until old foes rear their demeaning heads.The story of the battle uses the tennis court as judicial court, and lawyers are replaced by racquets. Unfortunately, the courtroom dialogue here is bland and fabricated. Painfully obvious commentators fill the duty of disputing, and characters reduce a nuanced and fascinating conflict to a polarized fable of a people group's struggle. A zip- line plot skims over important issues and commercializes the triumph of a very special team of women and men."
26,Battle of the Sexes,6,8 October 2017,Racket Revolution,"I saw ""Battle of the Sexes"", starring Emma Stone-La La Land, Superbad; Steve Carell-Foxcatcher, Little Miss Sunshine; Sarah Silverman-Masters of Sex_tv, School of Rock and Bill Pullman-The Equalizer, The Grudge. This is based on a true story that helped change women's rights in sports and jump start the sexual revolution-at the time, women were being paid about 1/8th of what men were. It took place in 1973 in the Houston Astrodome. Emma plays Billie Jean King-at 29 years old-the reigning women's tennis champion. Steve-at 55 years old-is the chauvinistic men's champ that makes big spectacles when he is on the tennis court-dresses in costumes & makes remarks like 'Women belong in the kitchen and the bedroom!'. Steve brags that he can beat Emma and gets his chance on national TV to put his racket where his mouth is. The movie also goes into the personal lives of both players, one is a gambling addict and the other is dealing with sexual identity issues- I'll let you decide which problem belongs to whom. Sarah plays Emma's manager and Bill plays the head of the tennis association that also happens to be a chauvinist. Remember, this was the 70's and lots of things were different then. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute. I don't think I would buy it on DVD-one viewing was enough-but it would be a good rental."
27,Battle of the Sexes,7,21 September 2017,Steve Carell outdoes himself as a Male Chauvinist Pig,"Great role for him. He's a natural at being lovably hate-able.Interesting characters all round with a few surprise twists for me anyway who was unaware of the whole story that took place in the 70's.A few interesting subplots going on till we get to the big battle at the end.Real feel good ending.Interesting to see how women have been rising up against inequality, and occasionally winning big.Very entertaining."
28,Battle of the Sexes,4,16 January 2018,Good but not great...,"Emma Stone and Steve Carell really do disappear into the roles they play. But it felt like the movie was just lacking something. Enjoyable enough, worth a rental."
29,Battle of the Sexes,8,13 January 2018,Focus on King's Sexual Laison and Rigg's Nuttiness Compromise Basically the Most Powerful Episode of the Women's Movement,"The famous (or infamous) tennis match between Billie Jean King (Emma Stone), female tennis superstar, and Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell), former tennis champion and vocal bigot, coincided with other women's movements. For example, women professionals in the other fields, such as newspapers, picketed in their respective businesses. While the film generally portrayed the story of the match, I believe where this film failed was to bring into the larger context. Ultimately this story was not just about a middle-aged former tennis champion, albeit a bigoted one who claimed that women couldn't play sports, being put in his place by the best female tennis player of her generation go far beyond the foul lines. This was a microcosm of the larger conflict in which women were arguing that they had as much right to be in the workplace and enjoy the benefits of their labors as men. Still in this country, we have a salary gap between men and women, although certainly the gap is closing fast.The tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs was perhaps the climactic moment in the Women's Movement of the 1970's. As one reporter put it, it was the most meaningful meaningless tennis match in sports history. In other words, it was meaningful because it proved that yes, women could play sports with as much zeal, enthusiasm and prowess as men. It was meaningless only in the sense that this was not a ""grand slam"" tournament of some kind. Neither King nor Riggs would gain anything in the tennis rankings from this one-off.The film begins with King (Emma Stone) winning one of her many grand slam events. Next we learn about the struggle of women tennis players trying to gain recognition that their brand of tennis was at least of equal value to men. In several tournaments prior to the WTA, the women's prize money was only a fraction of the men, even though many finals matches on the women's side was sold out. Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman), former tennis champion and promoter-executive of professional tennis, is portrayed as the ""villain"" of the story, even more than Bobby Riggs.In a meeting (which may or may not be fictitious), Kramer meets with King and other female players who solicit him to increase the prize money for tournaments he produces and promotes on the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association. He declines with the rationale that the men's game makes much more money than the women's game. The women counter that the difference in prize money is 8 times, which would mean that the men's game makes 8-times as much money as the women's. Apparently, the showdown between Kramer and the top stars of women's tennis did happen, and nine players, including King, were barred from the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association tour, and the other women create the Virginia Slims Tour in retaliation, which finally forced the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association to merge with them. This much is factually accurate although the tour happened two years before the Battle of the Sexes match.The Virginia Slims Tennis Tour will eventually evolve into what is now the WTA, the Women's Tennis Association. I felt this part of the film was the strongest. The film then delves into two aspects of the personal lives of King and her rival Riggs. King with a spontaneous affair with a hairdresser and Riggs with his inability to stop gambling addictions. For some reason, I felt these episodes were a bit less interesting than focusing on the match and the implications of the Women's Movement.Still, great performances by Stone and Carell who captured the essences of their characters. Carell in particular features the nuttier antics of Riggs who honestly believed he could beat any female player (professional or otherwise) while sitting in a lawn chair. When the match finally happens, it's a great climactic event and saves the movie. The seed was that Riggs had beaten current no. 1 female tennis player, Margaret Court, portrayed as the well-mannered British player who would always do what she was told. A very good film but not quite a great one."
30,Battle of the Sexes,9,11 January 2018,A Film For The Times,"I really enjoyed the film and felt the performances were spot on! Especially, after then reading up about Billie Jean King and what she was up against as a professional female athlete in the 1970's. Both Emma Stone and Steve Carell hit home runs portraying their characters! At first, I thought I would find it odd to see them onscreen in these roles after their father/daughter roles in the film ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". But, they each embodied their characters so well it was never a thought. I found the film entertaining and very timely with all that is currently going on in Hollywood(and everywhere really) with regards to the heightened conversations about equality. It is true that women are viewed and treated much differently than men. Not only in sports, but in every occupation. Watching this only made me realize how far we still need to go in this antiquated viewpoint. Not so much has changed. With this said, it is a well written, well acted film that tells Billie Jean King's story. I didn't know much about her before watching this and I'm very happy they made this film."
31,Battle of the Sexes,8,11 January 2018,Very enjoyable and entertaining,"Emma Stone and Steve Carrel keep this movie interesting. I'd never really paid attention to that story when it was happening in real life, so it was a good reminder of that event, not to mention of how things were back in the day. We've come a lot farther than we think on women's issues--not that there isn't room for more change. It was easy to watch and moved at a good pace. But beyond the women's issue--it was a great story about stepping up to the plate, taking risk, and the competitive spirit. We both enjoyed it."
32,Battle of the Sexes,6,10 January 2018,wasted potential,"Battle of the Sexes had the potential to be a lot better than it was, it has a cool story, the direction of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris is good and he manages to direct very cool and dynamic tennis scenes, but he fret in character development and in scenes that should be dramatic enough to fiddle with the viewer, have scenes that had a lot of potential to be very exciting but the medium script and a direction that makes a lot of mistakes seems to be just a forced scene, the cast that stands out is Steve Carrel in a good performance and Emma Stone that is also very well, but honestly neither of them is level to be indicated to oscar, is a movie that when it ends is going to be a feeling of disappointment of something that could have been much better. Note 6.0"
33,Battle of the Sexes,5,9 January 2018,"Great Acting, Mediocre Usage of the Source Material","The highpoint of the largely unfocused Battle of the Sexes is Carell and Stone's acting, coupled with the intriguing blend of modern day filmmaking techniques and 70's flair from directors Dayton and Faris. Unfortunately, the film tries to juggle too many aspects of Billie Jean King's life in messy procedure (personal issues and relationships, public image, corporate relationship) while Carell is largely playing a caricature of Bobby Riggs instead of a believable individual. Instead of focusing on the main conflict of the movie (the actual sport of tennis from two respective titans of the sport) the audience is treated to glossy montages and rushed character development leading up to a pitiful final act."
34,Battle of the Sexes,,9 January 2018,More micro romance drama than macro social issue,"Early in the movie, in a confrontation (one of many throughout the movie), tennis tycoon Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman) tries to enlighten Billie Jean King (Emma Stone) to the obvious tennis fact-of-life that ""people pay to see men play"". At around the same time (1973) I remember reading an article in ""Sports Illustrated"" entitled ""Four Queens Make A Full House"". It eludes me whether that was before or after this iconic match, but that really doesn't matter. Changes were coming, and this ""battle of the sexes"" has been generally recognized as a significant catalyst.Two of the ""four queens"" appeared in the movie: King and Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee). The third was Evonne Goolagong, Australian Aboriginal whose natural, graceful movement on court was described not as ""running"" but as ""floating"". The fourth, Chris Evert, was the women's counterpart of Bjorn Borg in the context of their tenacious playing style. ""Players thinking of outlasting them in a match by playing into the next day better think again. They are prepared to play into the next week!"", someone once said.This was the time in sports history when the Miami Dolphins ruled the NFL and the Montreal Canadiens the NHL. In tennis, wooden rackets were still the only kind available (hard to imagine, I know), and the most popular brand had the signature of Jack Kramer on it!So much for backdrop of the spectator sports universe. Back to the movie. There seems to be a general consensus among critics that this is a good movie, but fails to go deep enough into the key issue of pay equality for women in tennis. Maybe it is just me, but these critics all seem to gloss over another equally significant theme, King's relationship with her lover, hair dresser Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough), a ""phase"", as her husband Larry King (Austin Stowell) said in the movie. Still, the movie could use an alternative title ""A hard choice for Billie Jean: Marilyn or tennis"". That story is well known to tennis players. At that time, even the non-tennis-playing public's imagination was set on fire by this ""circus"". Over-the-hill champion, compulsive gambler, sort of a hustler, bit of a clown and, best of all, a self-proclaimed male chauvinist pig, Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell) somehow is inspired by the idea of challenging the top woman tennis player to a match. King, fully focusing on promoting her quest of a women's tour, flatly turns him down. When Court defeats King (on any given day, any of these top players could beat any other) in a match and becomes number one, she also becomes ready prey for Riggs. The result is one-sided, Riggs beating Court easily. But the fact that Court beats King and Riggs beats Court does not automatically mean that Riggs will beat King on any given day. The challenge has become something that King cannot afford to decline. In the match that becomes a major entertainment event, King beats Riggs in three straight sets. This is the tennis part of the story.The other story has been given almost equal attention as tennis (if not equal screen time). While the tennis match is tackled with sarcastic humor, the love affair is handled with tender loving care. Barnett, an experienced lesbian lover, initiates the relationship with King who hitherto has only one person in her love life - her husband. But, even more importantly, love life is not her priority. Tennis is. The alternative title I suggested above tells all.2018 Golden Globe results were announced yesterday. Emma Stone did not win Best Actress back-to-back, and she was not expected to. Still, the nomination gives her recognition for tackling a role that can arguably be considered casting against type. While not reaching the height of Gary Oldman as Churchill (doubt if anybody can), Stone did a good job in hiding the sweet darling of a persona and bringing up a woman that sometimes is almost sexless (especially when concentrating on tennis). It is through the superb, sensuous portrayal of Marilyn by Andrea Riseborough that the sensuous side of Billie Jean is brought to the surface. Steve Carell's Bobby Riggs as crafted in this movie leans towards being favorable, ""humanized"" as one critic puts it. There is solid support from the rest of the cast: Sarah Silverman as the no-nonsense tour manager Gladys Heldman, Natalie Morales as outspoken buddy Rosie Casals, Elisabeth Shue as Riggs's rich and ultimately tolerant wife Priscalla, as well as aforementioned Pullman, McNamee and Stowell. Personally, a great delight is to see archived footage of the one and only Howard Cosell, who at that time owned Monday nights TV screens in the NFL season. As well, there is a blink-and-you'll-miss footage of Chris Evert intimating in an interview that she gave King the better odds."
35,Battle of the Sexes,4,7 January 2018,Was expecting more,"Was great to see more backstory of Billie Jean and lesbian issues.Was disappointed in that it says it's a ""Comedy"". Even though most
of the actors were comedians, it's not a funny movie. I hate when
comedians want to become serious.Movie tackles big issues. It's a Drama. That's it, and good retelling
of the big event.As a tennis fan it hurt me most to learn that one of my favorite players,
Jack Kramer, was a male chauvinist. I owned his racquet. Loved his racquet.
Loved his tennis. Please don't tell me more about Rod Laver or Roger
Federer. It just might crush me to nothing."
36,Battle of the Sexes,4,7 January 2018,"Cheesy, disregarding the 2 very tallented actor-leads","Cheap dramatization, poorly mise-en-scene despite the 2 very versatile actor-leads. There are 2 tennis movies this year. Biorg vs. McEnroe wins in this category this year.There was no dramatic tension, no thrill... it was just the fact that women's liberating tennis player should win. She won.Don't misunderstand: I am a fan of equal rights and feminism but I find this movie simply cheesy."
37,Battle of the Sexes,,7 January 2018,Very enjoyable,"This turned out to be much more involving than I had expected. Emma Stone is perhaps one of the most likable actresses around, and she's always able to effortlessly bring so much charisma to roles like this. She did it in La La Land and she does it here. Very effective. Steve Carell is also very good, much better here than in his forced dramatic performance in Last Flag Flying. From the supporting players, it is Andrea Riseborough that impresses the most. What a lovely, natural turn."
38,Battle of the Sexes,6,7 January 2018,A reasonable look at 'Battle of the Sexes',"Wow, judging by some of the other reviews for 'Battle of the Sexes', you can really see how films like this bring out the loonies. It's a shame that more rational, sane human beings don't write IMDB reviews. That said, what follows is a moderate review, containing no rage, bigotry, rampant misogyny or certifiable lunacy. 'Battle of the Sexes' was disappointing, in that the trailers promised a film centered around the eponymous tennis match between Bobby Riggs and Billy Jean King. The film, however, diverged from this in the first half to focus heavily on the theme of King grappling with her lesbian desires via an affair with the tournament hairdresser. As this doesn't have any connection to the central plot, it feels artificially shoehorned in to the story for the sake of making a statement. It also quickly becomes tedious if, like me, you were expecting a story about a tennis match. Her interactions with her husband, who susses out what's happening, are also awkward, distracting, and don't really paint her in a good light. The main narrative was much more interesting and actually well-developed. This involved the female pro tennis players breaking off and forming their own association and then struggling to get endorsement deals and find ways to make a financial go of it and gain respectability. The exhibition match arises in this context. The new women's association needs the press and the money; and for King it is a chance to prove that women's tennis is not ""a joke"". On the Riggs side, the film also did a good job of showing his back story - his gambling addiction and need to constantly find ways to prove his relevance to the sport as an aging player. He was no doubt a chauvinist, but was played very (maybe too) sympathetically in this film. If the film had stayed closer to these narrative lines and trimmed off twenty-or-so minutes, it would have been a much more compelling watch.The match itself was done quite well. As a tennis fan, I enjoyed it.As a footnote, I've always though that women should play five-set matches, just like the men. There's no reason why they can't, and it would make women's tennis much more compelling from a spectator point of view. And if they play five sets, they should get the same pay. I think that's a reasonable notion, and I look forward to the day it becomes a reality."
39,Battle of the Sexes,,4 January 2018,A Tedious and Unfunny 1970s Sports Dramedy,"A female tennis star wrestles with the patriarchy and her own sexuality in the gyno-centric sports dramedy Battle of the Sexes (2017), written by Simon Beaufoy and directed by Jonathan Dayton. A retelling of the most-watched tennis match of all time, between ex-champion Bobby Riggs and top female player Billie Jean King, seemed promising, but something misfired along the way. It was partly billed as a comedy, and features both Sarah Silverman and Steve Carell, but ends up only being mildly amusing.It's the early 1970s. Tennis star Billie Jean King (Emma Stone) and her manager Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman) confront Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman) about gross inequality in tennis prize money between male and female players. In outrage, they storm off to found their own women's tennis association. Meanwhile, ex-tennis star Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell) has hit a new low as his gambling addiction threatens to tear apart his family.As her new league takes off, Billie Jean King's behavior threatens her marriage as well, when she meets hairstylist Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough) and discovers she is attracted to women. This affair seems to have little effect on her life, however, when her cuckolded husband, Larry King (Austin Stowell), shrugs it off and continues to faithfully dote on her.Meanwhile, Bobby Riggs comes up with a way to exploit controversy over the women's lib movement to make money and challenges top female tennis players to an exhibition bout. He handily defeats Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee), who is portrayed as somehow flawed and weakened by her loving devotion to her husband and child. Billie Jean King finally accepts the challenge and ends up humiliating Riggs in a match dubbed ""The Battle of the Sexes.""Most sports films feature an underdog overcoming adversity to win the final match, and elements of this film reminded me of the greatest underdog story of all time, Rocky (1976). Bobby Riggs' antics mirrored that of Apollo Creed, who also learned a lesson in humility in the finale. Billie Jean King, however, was no underdog. She was at the height of her career, among the top female tennis players in the world, and successfully launched her own all-female tennis league.By the time the climactic match arrived, I was more relieved the film was finally over than I was to find out who won. There was really nothing at stake in a match that was essentially a meaningless promotional stunt. Billie Jean King easily defeated Bobby Riggs. In the end, she showed a female tennis player at the top of her game could beat a 55-year-old retiree.In my opinion, the story of how Billie Jean King founded the Women's Tennis Association and struggled with her sexuality is much more interesting than the match with Bobby Riggs. Unfortunately, that was the marketing hook the filmmakers thought would draw viewers to this film, but ends up feeling secondary to the main drama.The biggest problem with Battle of the Sexes was that it feigned interest in telling both sides of the story but was really about Billie Jean King. The fact real-life Billie Jean King consulted on the movie, while Riggs is no longer around to defend himself, compounded the problem. What resulted was King's triumphant story as seen through her eyes, which would have been fine if it was shot and advertised that way. Instead, we get a half-hearted attempt to develop Riggs' character and give him a story arch.Overall, Battle of the Sexes lacked a clear focus. If the movie is about King's struggle, make it about that. If it's about the match between King and Riggs, make it about that. Either one of those movies would have been more entertaining than this convoluted and drawn out snoozefest."
40,Battle of the Sexes,6,4 January 2018,The Vidiot Reviews....,"The Battle of the SexesThe most sexist thing about sport is that female athletes pay double what men pay for steroids.Back in the seventies, however, the sport in this dramedy capitalized off that inequality.To prove superiority over women, and feed his gambling addiction, former #1 Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell) comes out of retirement to challenge current top-female tennis player Billie Jean King (Emma Stone) to a bout. While initially refusing, the closeted King eventually agrees to face the chauvinist on the court. In the process, however, the marriages of both players disintegrate.With a comedic supporting cast on hand to facilitate its talented leads, this true story provides the backstory of the oddball pair that has always been missing from the much-ballyhooed match. Moreover, its socially conscience subject matter mirrors our current climate of social change. Lastly, men and women can be equal in sport so long as men don't wear cups. Green Light"
41,Battle of the Sexes,7,4 January 2018,"Contends for fanfare from both queer and female demography, but with only one arrow for two bull's eyes, the rest is common sense.","A retro-flair imbued period drama depicting the ballyhoo of the 1973 titular tennis throw-down between a 29-year-old Billie Jean King (Stone) and a 55-year-old Bobby Riggs (Carell), a game, impinges on the former as a match she cannot lose because her gender equality campaign for female tennis players, to a broader extent, women's liberation movement, is hanging by a thread, while for the latter, who makes no bones about accepting the epithet ""male chauvinistic pig"", it is merely another gamble to cash in on the current furor, a canny ploy only if had betted on the right winner, and invites sideswipe of the country's capitalistic complexion.Wife-and-husband director duo Faris-Dayton belatedly parlayed their fortune from music video manufacturers to the feature filmmaking in 2006 with the underdog indie charmer LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, BATTLE OF THE SEXES is their third film, a meticulously crafted commodity briskly capturing its milieu's zeitgeist with an arousing real story at its disposal, there is no question about who is the winner of the battle, so Faris-Dayton dutifully delves into the two protagonists' personal affairs to find more relevant fodder to enrich the picture.From Billie Jean's aspect, she has been a longtime LGBTQ advocate, thus the script (penned by Oscar-winner Simon Beaufoy) plays up her sexual awakening concurrent with the impending game, her budding romance with hairdresser Marilyn Barnett (Riseborough) intersects with guilt, thrill and perplexity attendant with this incipient discovery. Admittedly, Emma Stone gives another creditable performance which requires as much brawn as brain, but what one feels inarticulate is the designation of Marilyn, curtailed by the real-life aftermath (their affair didn't end up on friendly terms years later), the film puts her in a very waffling position due to the suspect nature of her import in Billy Jean's life, she is neither the right helpmate, nor a passing flame to quench the loins only, Marilyn's role is too politically correct to be befouled but also cannot erect herself steadfastly along with Billy Jean's role model then-husband Larry King (a swell and blond Stowell), who is given another artistic license here (the real Larry claimed he had never suspected Billy Jean's lesbianism before Marilyn's palimony lawsuit was made public in 1981), therefore, the final impression is somewhat blithe and bland. For a clown-like Bobby, it is his compulsive gambling habit becomes his bane, Steve Carrell is completely in his element in lampooning Bobby's larger-than-life schticks (a distasteful personage is too feasible by half to find its analogy in USA's current state of head), and in those quieter moments, Carrell also veritably registers an air of disconsolation, especially in his final appearance in the changing room after being vanquished, that shows more ambiguity in his public/personal dichotomy, is he a real sexist or just pretends to be one? One might lean towards the latter. Casting Alan Cumming as a mentor-like costume designer in vouchsafing Billie Jean's rite of self-acknowledge of her sexuality, and at the same time, re-enacting veristic snippets of the women-empowering final tennis combat, BATTLE OF THE SEXES contends for fanfare from both queer and female demography, it aims high, but the adage is, you cannot have your cake and eat it too, one arrow and two bull's eyes, the rest is common sense."
42,Battle of the Sexes,9,1 January 2018,"An Oscar contender, great job by all involved.","I'm old so I remember the actual event. This movie was a very good depiction of a cultural changing event. A sad day for male chauvinists, a shock to the system for professional sports and a boon to everyone else.  The production company did a great job re-creating the 1970s. What was most striking to me was the money, or the small amounts of money involved. for the event. The men's tennis champion got 12K for a tournament. Even the 100K prize for the exhibition match between King and Riggs watched by 90 million people. Compared to today when a player can get hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for saying, I Like This Shoe."" ---Probably the reason for the high cost of sports tickets, pay per view and of course shoes."
43,Battle of the Sexes,5,27 December 2017,This movie tries so little to drag you in.,"I mean, the movie does little to get you invest in the characters in the beginning. After that, what's the point. 
The story is inspirational and if you follow tennis, you do know the inspiration behind this.
The movie means well. But after that 30 minute mark, what is the point of trying, man? Ooo here is Emma Stone, support her. Here is a lesbian love interest, support her. Ooo here is Steve Carell, love him. Actually his character is alright. He is one of the best parts in the movie. 
But seriously? The lesbian love interest, that was never well built. And at the 30 minute mark Billie Jean experiments with the woman and it feels forced. Not natural at all! How did that happen?
After that, is is alright. It builds up well towards the end and has a good ending. 
This will not bore you in any way but you can watch something better."
44,Battle of the Sexes,6,23 September 2017,Fight for equality.,"Billy Jean King a professional tennis takes the bait from Bobby Riggs a professional hustler to play a tennis match billed as the battle of the sexes. The real story is the personal story of Billie Jean King. In that regard it works as a love story.Emma Stone gives another award worthy performance. Steve Carell wears the nose and teeth as he did when he was previously overlooked at award time as a wrestling coach. The tennis shots during the opening credits are fast and interesting. The tennis match play was way to slow considering the level of the participants.There is plenty of dialogue and a good dialogue free moment after the match. That was spoiled quickly with a speech that was way too obvious by the clothing designer.The movie is in limited release but it looks good on the big screen and should be seen theatrically. It was shot on film, maybe because the movement of a tennis ball doesn't track as well in digital photography."
45,Battle of the Sexes,,6 October 2017,"Watch ""When Billie Beat Bobby"" instead.","My wife and I support the ideas shown in this film, but the film itself isn't so great. The story line of each character seems under cooked. They are not that well rounded and this makes it more difficult to enjoy the movie. I am now going to recommend a better film that covers the same ground this one attempts to cover. It is called ""When Billie Beat Bobby"". It was shown on ABC in the late nineteen nineties. It starred Holly Robbins as King and Ron Silver as Briggs. Watch that instead. It is a far superior film despite both films sharing the same writer. My wife tells me it is on DVD so buy it and support good work."
46,Battle of the Sexes,6,8 October 2017,"Breezy, lightweight recreation of famed dust-up between tennis icon and washed-up former champion","Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who brought us the insufferable ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" are on more solid ground in their historical recreation of the famed ""Battle of the Sexes"" 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs.Emma Stone and Steve Carrell, who play the principals, bear a close resemblance to their true-life counterparts and Dayton and Faris do very well in recreating the look of the era replete with nifty motor vehicles, the white, non-descript titles seen on TV screens during sports broadcasts and the fashions of the day (including the colorful outfits designed for the tennis players).Carrell as Bobby Riggs proves to be a tad bit more interesting in his part as the washed-up, middle-aged former champion who is also an unrepentant gambler. Carrell humanizes the character by emphasizing his good nature coupled with the lack of discipline. Indeed it's his gambling that leads his wife to throw him out of the house, only to later take him back after the match.Emma Stone is less interesting as Billie King Jean, as her part drifts dangerously close to hagiography. Her burgeoning homosexuality, illustrated by her relationship with Marilyn Barnett, the hairdresser who services the players on the women's tour, proves to be an unexciting affair at best. More egregious is the fact that the film's scenarists left out the fact that later in 1981, Barnett sued Billie Jean for her share of ""galimony""a gambit which ultimately proved unsuccessful.Stone does have her moments however, in her confrontation with Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman), the male chauvinist head of the tennis association which leads Billie Jean to defect and form her own league of female tennis professionals.According to a number of articles I've read, Battle of the Sexes pretty much follows what happened historically; however, the chronology of some of the events appears to be altered in order to make the narrative flow a bit smoother.One thing I was unaware of was that Riggs played the woman's champion, Margaret Court, before taking on Billie Jean, in an exhibition match in which he beat her. Court (played by a steely Jessica McNamee) is nicely contrasted with King as she was conservative and didn't approve of King's gay predilections or homosexuality in general.Ultimately the big match between King and Riggs takes on a life of its own and becomes a feel-good paean for woman's rights. Certainly King's fight to obtain financial parity with the male athletes was noble, but the actual match itself only proved that middle-aged men are no longer in the bloom of youth. Battle of the Sexes is pretty much a lightweight affair but enjoyable as it entertains, just like the original confrontation between a tennis icon and washed-up former champion."
47,Battle of the Sexes,7,4 October 2017,"Decent slice of American sports history, well-captured","Putting all judgments aside about what kind of statements this film might make about sexism and homophobia in the present day, this cinematic portrayal of the famous 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs is quite entertaining and well-acted. For those of us who weren't born yet, this light and diverting film provides a nice overview of the spark that Billie Jean King gave to women's equality in the 1970s and how she became a true pioneer in that regard. By contrast, the film tentatively touches upon the issue of homophobia, but it's better to have a true portrayal of the era rather than something anachronistic and too contemporary.Emma Stone plays against type here, giving a solid performance as the awkward but quietly competitive King. She fully embodies King's principled drive and down to earth charm. Her deep angst about finally embracing her sexual orientation and her determination to successfully advance gender equality in the sport of tennis provides a source of character conflict that, again, was true to that era.But the film's trump card is Steve Carell who gives his most likable performance ever as the goofy and cocky Riggs who had no problem becoming the standard-bearer of male chauvinism in a game whose culture and pay structure strongly favored men. We come to see Riggs as considerably less off-putting than the ideology he humorously defended. The real villain in this story is not Riggs, but Jack Kramer, (a smug Bill Pullman) the head of the Association of Tennis Professionals, whose unapologetic institutional sexism pervaded the sport at the time. We come to learn that Kramer's genuine disdain for women's equality is the motivating factor that helps light a fire under King in her match against Riggs.My only criticism would be that the match itself could have been a bit more gripping. It's filmed in a way that, although true to the game, feels detached and distant. Perhaps the filmmakers wanted to make it look as real as possible, but for a cinematic climax, it lacks tension, even if it's gratifying watching King put Riggs away with one power stroke after another. Recommended as light, quality filmmaking."
48,Battle of the Sexes,,2 October 2017,Women and this film win big.,"""You've come a long way, Baby."" Virginia Slims' promo Although it is difficult to determine just how far women's rights and social equality have progressed in the last half century, the victory of Billie Jean King over Bobby Riggs in the 1973 tennis exhibition match was a spectacular publicity success for all movements where women fought male chauvinism on the court, in the courts, and in the home. Based on the real events, Battle of the Sexes is a successful film rendering of the battle for that equality.Besides, it's an entertaining docudrama. Emma Stone as King certifies herself as an actress of considerable range after her Oscar for the romantic La La Land. Steve Carell as Riggs is playful and cunning just like Riggs, who underestimated King's skill and savvy.The principals of this contest knew much more than money rode on its promotion, for chauvinists like Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman) needed the lesson that women were worth the same money as male athletes. Besides, the world itself needed to change its attitude about the inferiority of women.Acclaimed directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris faithfully and impressively recreate the '70's with such jewels as a sound track featuring Crimson and Clover and Rocket Man. The directors valiantly though sometimes abruptly cut between the two camps, frequently stressing King's emerging gay interest in hairdresser Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough).While dramatizing this facet of the LGBT movement, the filmmakers allow the sequences involving the lovers to be at times too long and obvious. Yet, as I think of how difficult it is for gay athletes even today to be up front about their sexuality, I must commend the depiction in this film.Although freedom of choice was undoubtedly a sub theme, the game afoot was tennis, and Riggs and King were clown and queen. It was great entertainment that this docudrama gets about perfectly right. And let's thank the Williams sisters for carrying the torch into modern life with dignity."
49,Battle of the Sexes,7,24 September 2017,"Not an Ace, but it Certainly Was an Entertaining Match","The Battle of the Sexes was one of the most important tennis matches and sporting events ever for women's sports. The basis being that it's all about acceptance. The film certainly is a neat interpretation of the events, with worthy performances, but I'm not sure it ever reached the level of significance that its source material demanded.Reuniting after starring together in Crazy, Stupid, Love, Steve Carell and Emma Stone star as Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean-King respectively. And as expected, both give great performances. Even though both people are vastly different in personality and age (amongst many other things), I loved the way the film portrayed them as equals. Both Riggs and King go through several personal struggles before ever getting on the tennis court with each other. So yes, it's very gratifying to see King take on a man who belittled female athletes and show the world that women who play sports should be taken seriously too, but there's also the personal battles each are going through that add another layer to the match.That's also where the film lacked for me though. As much as I liked seeing Billie fall in love with a woman, which was still taboo at the time, that story tended to overpower the battle with Riggs. I felt like there was more time spent building up Riggs and King alone, that we didn't get enough time to spend with the two of them budding heads, which was one of the main selling points of the movie for me. In fact, it almost seemed like King's battle for women was actually more so with Jack Kramer than it was with Riggs. Perhaps I'm not as familiar with the source material as I should be, but I was a little bit letdown with the lack of tension between Riggs and King.Overall, the movie is a perfectly fine film that is sure to draw some Oscar attention. The tennis looks great, the actors do great work, and the events seem to be adapted quite well. But I was just hoping for a little bit more oomph from the story. I was expecting to walk out inspired, instead I was just entertained for a few hours. It's not the most memorable piece of art.7.0/10"
50,Battle of the Sexes,9,9 October 2017,Refreshingly Accurate,"Audiences sometimes show a tendency to stay away from movies founded upon actual people or events, possibly resisting the feeling of allowing a history lesson to interfere with their entertainment. Even a terrific movie such as ""The Right Stuff"" in 1983 suffered at the box office because many film-goers mistakenly believed the picture to be a documentary.Possibly that's the reason Fox Searchlight Pictures is opening the wonderful new movie ""Battle of the Sexes"" with such apparent caution, debuting first in major cities and adding additional locations as the picture builds critical and popular momentum.""Battle of the Sexes"" depicts with refreshing accuracy an actual 1973 event, at a time when women in sports were achieving some parity with men. The aging Bobby Riggs, sensing in the times an opportunity for self-promotion and financial gain, publicly challenged in turn two of tennis' reigning female championsfirst Margaret Court and then Billie Jean Kingto matches against him, boasting no woman could compete and prevail in a sporting activity against a man.It seems like the only person who's trying to turn ""Battle of the Sexes"" into a history lesson is actor Steve Carell, playing the real-life former tennis champion turned gambler, promoter, and hustler Bobby Riggs. Carell disappears so completely into his characterization of Bobby Riggs that it often seems like there's no Steve Carell left.That might be a wonderful achievement for Carell as an actor. But in vanishing so completely into his role, Carell risks alienating the audience in much the same way Dustin Hoffman and Jim Carrey did in 1974's ""Lenny"" and 1999's ""Man on the Moon."" Both Hoffman and Carrey were consumed so completely by their impersonations that they forgot their primary goal was to entertain the audiencein their characterizations, Lenny Bruce and Andy Kaufman, the real-life comics they portrayed, became deeply unfunny and unsympathetic people. Faring better in ""Battle of the Sexes"" is actress Emma Stone as Billie Jean King. With little cosmetic modification beyond her hair style and the addition of King's trademark glasses, Stone easily captures the iconic tennis star's natural dignity and poise. That King is depicted as also coming to terms with her sexuality might be the telescoping of events for dramatic purposes, but the point works well in creating a human dimension in a character who might otherwise have been depicted as too driven, goal-oriented, and bloodless.Written by Simon Beaufoy and directed by the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, ""Battle of the Sexes"" becomes a richly enjoyable chronicle of a time and event modern audiences might find difficult to imagine. Those fearing a civics seminar or a documentary can relaxin this retelling, history takes a backseat to superb entertainment."
51,Battle of the Sexes,7,7 October 2017,Good entertainment,"I really like this movie, which works very hard to present an authentic and thoughtful account of the mad 1973 tennis match in which top women's player Billie Jean King played the much older former men's champion Bobby Riggs. I still prefer the 2013 documentary, simply because, for once, what happened in real life was engrossing and entertaining enough and didn't need the Hollywood treatment. This film has many good qualities, including the understated yet vivid period clothes and locations. I love the scene where the senior women players are eating chips and smoking in a diner, and no one cares - that wouldn't happen in these health-conscious times. Also the sign of a good movie is that the supporting actors are all excellent, from Sarah Silverman as the women's tour director Gladys Heldman, to Alan Cumming as British tennis fashion designer Ted Tinling, and Elisabeth Shue, as Bobby's wife Priscilla Riggs. In particular, Austin Stowell, as Billie Jean's husband, Larry King, deserves an award for nailing his difficult role as the husband having to cope with his wife's feelings for her hairdresser Marilyn. Billie Jean and Larry are still affectionate to one another but Stowell is able to convey several stages that Larry goes through in response to the situation. Steve Carell is probably the perfect actor to play Bobby Riggs - goofy and driven and needing to be the centre of attention. The role was really made for him, although in the 2013 doco you can see that the real Bobby was even more over the top. The movie version goes further than the doco in saying Bobby had a serious gambling problem. But overall the movie gives an affectionate depiction of Riggs. Ironically, his match with Billie Jean served to bring the women's movement into the public eye. Interestingly, Bobby's motivation for staging the match is depicted more as coming from his own attention seeking antics, and desire to make money, than misogyny. But other people, such as the male executives running the tennis tour, clearly are misogynists. There's a great scene when Billie- Jean and Gladys make very logical arguments to the executives that women attract the same crowds as men, so why don't they get the same income? The executives can only mumble that 'women are less strong and skilled than men', and that 'men are the bread winners and need to earn more'. The other top women's player of the era, Margaret Court, is depicted as the villain of the movie, sulking around hotels with her husband and baby while the other women players pass her in groups. I felt that maybe the film's writers treated her a little harshly. She was very conservative, that's true, and has come under heavy criticism for her views lately. The 2013 documentary depicts how Riggs psyched-out Court to defeat her before the King match - he defeated her mentally. The movie strangely didn't pick up on this point. Instead, Court is shown just playing badly. I felt Emma Stone did well in her role playing King - later in the movie she got a bit over-emotional, but generally she was convincing. You really understood what a difficult situation King was in when she explained to her lover Marilyn that her parents will disown her and she may lose her career of she comes out as gay. I'm glad King, in real life, has finally got recognition for her great courage and hard work in creating a new women's tennis tour, and for campaigning hard for equal pay for women, even though that's only started to be introduced in recent years. She was such a strong person, aside from being obviously a gifted tennis player.."
52,Battle of the Sexes,7,7 September 2017,Timely portrayal,"What an extremely relevant time to release this movie. Talks of Serena playing a male tennis player have been buzzing around for months. Emma Stone puts on a great portrayal of Billie Jean King, but does get overshadowed by Steve Carell's performance portraying the misogynist Bobby Riggs. He makes you cringe with most of his antics and you get a reminder of his years as the boss in ""The Office"". The story is one that this new generation could learn from."
53,Battle of the Sexes,8,11 October 2017,Battle of the Sexes is an entertaining movie about the legendary tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs,This was a fascinating docudrama about the match between Bobby Riggs-the middle-aged admitted male chauvinist-and Billie Jean King-the phenomenal female tennis champ. We see each of their lives before the match and marvel at the period of the times and how certain social situations were handled at the time and what changes were happening during it. Emma Stone and Steve Carell embody their roles to the hilt. Also fascinating hearing Howard Cosell's commentary throughout the actual action when he originally did it on ABC during that time. I saw this with my movie theatre-working friend and we both highly recommend it!
54,Battle of the Sexes,10,11 October 2017,"Funny, surprisingly emotional, and inspiring too.","'BATTLE OF THE SEXES': Five Stars (Out of Five) 
A sports biopic based on the highly publicized 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. It stars Emma Stone as King and Steve Carell as Riggs; with Andrea Riseborough, Austin Stowell, Elisabeth Shue, Sarah Silverman, Bill Pullman, Natalie Morales and Alan Cumming in supporting roles. The movie was directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the duo also helmed 2006's 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE' (also costarring Carell), and it was written by Simon Beaufoy (who also wrote 1997's 'THE FULL MONTY'). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, but it's a disappointment at the Box Office so far. I loved it! 
In 1973 Billie Jean King, and other professional women tennis players, are sick of getting paid peanuts compared to the male pros. So they start their own women's tournament, and find sponsoring through a cigarette company. Bobby Riggs (Carell) is a retired ex-champion tennis player, who also thinks he should be paid more money for a game than he's currently being offered, and he sees a chance to make a lot of money by challenging Billie Jean King to a match. King knows it's all a publicity stunt for Riggs, so she's reluctant to accept his challenge, but then she feels obligated to defend all of women tennis players, by participating in the match.
The movie is funny, surprisingly emotional, and inspiring too. Both Stone and Carell are fantastic in the lead roles, and I really like how the filmmakers didn't make Bobby Riggs the 'bad guy' of the movie. He was obviously doing it just to get back in the game, and make some money in the process, and he's actually a really sympathetic character in it. So is Stone, as King, and she makes a great badass heroine in the movie too. There are some classic intense dialogue scenes as well, and some intimate emotional ones too. It's an all around really well made, and effective movie. I really liked 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE' too, it was my favorite film of 2006, and I think this is another great addition to Dayton and Faris's resume."
55,Battle of the Sexes,,9 October 2017,"So much fun, and Stone is terrific","A hugely uplifting, entertaining movie, with a typically dynamic central performance from Emma Stone, who inhabits the character of Billie Jean King almost entirely, as the tennis legend breaks away from the sexist tennis establishment, confronts the fact she's a lesbian, and gears up for the eponymous match, opposite self-styled 'male chauvinist pig', the shy and retiring Bobby Riggs.When I heard about the movie, I thought it might be dressing the occasion up as something it isn't, but it gets Riggs right − played by Steve Carell with great subtlety and chutzpah as a slightly pathetic hustler who plays the press like a violin − seeing the villain (represented by Bill Pullman's Jack Kramer) as the society that allows his phony chauvinistic bluster to land.Almost everything about the film is first-rate: the montages (I love a sports montage!), the pacing, much of the dialogue, it's just the one-dimensional nature of the human villainy (Kramer, Margaret Court) and the overt on-the-nose social commentary that feels too shallow and Hollywoodised: Alan Cumming's character, a gay costume designer, seems to have wandered in from The Hunger Games and just doesn't seem real. The audience loved him, but he's so magic gay: an acerbic queen who's really a wise and profound guardian angel.On the whole it's a really lovely film, though: incredibly fun and with such a deep, appealing performance from Stone: that penultimate scene in the changing room is so perfectly played, so complex and apposite, when most movies would have given her an unconvincing and sentimental fictional heart-to-heart with Riggs that explained her character and justified his."
56,Battle of the Sexes,4,28 December 2017,"Not a comedy, and not ashamed","Well, i expected more from a movie about the best woman tennis player (28 years of age) playing against a retired old male tennis player (55 years of age).
While this movie brands itself as drama+comedy, you can bet your last cents that there is nothing even remotely funny about this movie.
In fact, it feels as funny as if Ghost Busters 2016 come to life as a human being and wrote entire script for this movie.50 minutes into the movie and all male characters are either stupid, evil, desperate or gay.
The leading male characters:
1) Old guy who have been kicked OUT OF HIS OWN HOUSE because he gambles and wins, but because he is married to a woman that means she can do whatever she wants;
2) Tennis league man - guy who offers money to male tennis players and female tennis players, and gave them based on percentage on money earned from both those leagues - and that makes him evil;
3) The husband - beta cuck who have no spine and no soul;
4) Two gay guys working on wardrobe of female tennis players.Also, this movie for some reason tries to play as some sort of drama between three sides: women's empowerment, empowered women and feminism. On one hand, it shows that women can achieve anything they want if they work as hard as men. On the other hand, it shows as if women are helpless little flowers who can't do anything on their own and entire society is working against them.I especially disliked quote ""We just want a little bit more, a little bit what you have"" and it perfectly describes feminism - take away from men what men built and leaving them with nothing. And this movie shows it perfectly well: female players disliked playing in league controlled by a man, so they tried to take control of it themselves, but it failed, so they create a league of their own, and it failed as well. When ""female power"" failed, the lead once again decided to push into ""men's world"" and take it over. So, it is hard to define what this movie is trying to tell the viewer:
A) Women want to take everything over, because they can't build anything by themselves;
B) Women can do everything as long as they don't have compete with men.
And entire movie just wonder between these two concept without ever decided which one to stick to.The most comedic movement in entire movie was when nearly every single character took a match between an old man and woman in her prime as a serious thing. This entire part of the movie should have been comedy, but it was pointless dramatic build-up.
And what it was all for? At least they could keep it historically correct: media giants made a deal with Bobby Riggs which made him a lot of money, he spend that money to bet against himself to win even more money, because in reality he was is huge debts and owned lot of money, because of his gambling problems. Old guy didn't lose, he gave up. But i bet history might be too complicated for a movie which revolves around tho bizarre ideas i outlines before.So, overall, 4/10 and not worth watching again."
57,Battle of the Sexes,5,28 November 2017,Hollow and Badly Paced,"First I'll start with what I didn't like, because it's pretty much the first half of the movie. We meet Billy Jean King and Bobby Riggs, and get a little bit of their personal lives thrown in as well. Billy Jean is fighting for equal pay for women Tennis players, which leads her to leave the national Tennis association and form her own Women's tournament with like-minded individuals. During this tour of the country she meets a hairdresser, sharing some awkward dialogue, and suddenly the movie isn't about women's rights or Tennis any more, it's about Billy Jean finding her homosexuality.Before you get up in arms over this complaint, I realise Billy Jean King was important for gay rights...after this period of time. Squeezing this facet of her life into the movie is unnecessary and drags the it right down to the wells of boredom. We spend far too much time on her and her lover in hotel rooms as everyone somehow assumes the true nature of their relationship correctly (like seriously, when I see two women bunking up together in a hotel room together, gay lovers is still not my first thought even in 2017, let alone 1973). On this note it took me a while to realise Bobby Riggs was being kicked out by his wife as well, because he just assumes that's what's happening and drives off. Again, if a guy knocked on my door with the keys to a Rolls Royce, my first thought wouldn't be ""I'm being kicked out, see you later"", but that's a minor point anyway.Back to Billy Jean and her lover, fooling around in hotel rooms, trying to stay secret, but not holding it very well (apparently). I wouldn't have minded so much if it was well done, or if it sought a balance between it and the other sub-plots, or hell if it even had a point to exist in the movie. Instead it's hollow, uninteresting, and feels more like manufactured conflict just for the sake of creating a little bit of conflict. It detracts from the Women's tournament being hosted at the same time, and creates a massive void in the movie before the King/Riggs match has even been organised. And how is it resolved? Marilyn appears out of the blue to fix her hair before the match and then waves goodbye, never to be seen again.Also thanks to this vapid romance sub-plot, Billy Jean King's character really suffers as well. Emma Stone offers a great performance, but she doesn't get to show King any personality. The whole movie revolves around King and yet she's possibly the most two-dimensional character in the whole movie. We have to be told how much she loves Tennis rather than actually shown it, because all we're shown is her poorly developed love for Marilyn instead. Who is Billy Jean King? A lesbian feminist. End of line. I come out of the movie still feeling like I don't really know who she was as a person at all.On the flipside Bobby Riggs is the biggest highlight of the movie. His gambling addiction and self-confidence, coupled with his relationship with his wife make up the most interesting and entertaining moments of the movie. Steve Carell knocks it out the court, breathing so much life into him. What I particularly liked was how they made it clear that Riggs wasn't actually a chauvinistic pig, but it was just an act to get bums in seats and develop enough hype to make him relevant again. This becomes particularly poignant when King refuses his choice of commentator, because the misogyny is only an act for Riggs. For Kramer it's real. He genuinely doesn't consider women anywhere near equal to men.Another great part of the movie was the cinematography. Almost entirely filmed on 35mm, the film has this vintage edge to it. Every scene is sort of washed out like it was filmed in the 70s. It even starts with the classic Fox logo and the old recording of their theme for good measure. It, coupled with the fashions and technology, really pulls you into that time period. I may nitpick a little bit about the overuse of close-ups concealing much of the action, but it really is a nitpick. Yes I would've liked a wide shot of Riggs playing tennis while holding two dogs on a leash, but the movie doesn't exactly lose out from not having that shot.Battle of the Sexes was a little disappointing I confess. It spends too much time developing a relationship that holds no chemistry at the cost of the more interesting and relevant events going on at the time. Carell is less a co-star and more a support as he gets the shaft in screen time, which is even more infuriating because he's the only really worth watching the movie for. Great message in an enthralling setting, but badly paced, lacks charm or passion, and at it's best feels like your average, generic sporting drama. 5/10."
58,Battle of the Sexes,8,11 October 2017,Good battle!,"The directing duo team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris played a nice game of doubles in helming the true-based story ""Battle of the Sexes"" into cinematic screens. The film is based on the infamous tennis match in the early 70's between sweetheart female lib tennis great Billie Jean King and the male chauvinistic retired Hall-of-Famer Bobby Riggs. But the movie is much more than that, it also stages themes of gender equal rights, estranged marriages, sports management, and scores as a LOVE letter to the early 70's. Emma Stone serves up another ace performance, here as King. Steve Carell was a bit outlandish, but still returned serve with a sound performance. The film also had an advantage of very good supporting performances from Elisabeth Shue as Riggs' wife, Sarah Silverman as King's manager, and Andrea Riseborough as King's lesbian lover. ""Battle of the Sexes"" matches up quite right, and was not ""rigged"". Give it a try! **** Good"
59,Battle of the Sexes,7,24 September 2017,Decent Flick but Nothing New,"Nothing better represents the runaway id of the American public better than a big, unwieldy media circus. It'd be nice to think change can be made with frank and penetrating discussions. People stake entire careers on the idea that words and reason alone can carry the day. But if the recent controversy on the removal of Confederate statues is any indication  there simply is no substitution for raw, powerful symbolism.The news media, for all its faults understands this. This is why discussions of Black Lives Matter ultimately descend into arguments about Colin Kaepernick. Policy debates on income distribution start and end with the flashpoint of Warren Buffet's secretary and the issue of religious freedom is always forced into the context of homophobic bakers and their wedding cakes. The media takes advantage of these symbols and we as the viewing public love to lap it up.Thus it was with the infamous 1973 exhibition tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs known as the Battle of the Sexes. An out and vocal Women's Liberation and Title IX advocate, Billie Jean King was among the biggest symbols in the sport. She along with a cadre of women's players rebelled against the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) in the early seventies after they were offered an insulting twelve times less prize money than their male counterparts.This is about where the film actually begins and counts down the moments until King (Stone) goes up against infamous tennis hustler and self-described chauvinist pig Bobby Riggs (Carell). When not hoofing it out on the court, the film splits the narrative between Riggs's troubled home life and King's sexual awakening during her first Virginia Slims Tour. It is during these calmer human moments that the film shines brightest, as much of the heavy lifting is provided by an incredible cast.Emma Stone does wonders recreating the gritty, socially ambivalent King. Fresh off her Best Actress win for La La Land (2017), Stone once again portrays an easy-going warmth and vulnerability only this time unlined by a competitive feistiness. Scenes involving the underrated (and underutilized) Andrea Riseborough coalesce with a lovely chemistry that defies easy description. Meanwhile, in the other foxhole, Carell's performance pops with gregarious intensity. Not only is his Riggs a chauvinist and hustler but a compulsive gambler with a knack for headline grabbing hokum. ""Any publicity is good publicity"" is a cliché that should be written on his family crest, though that might incite the ire of his long suffering wife (Shue).Despite all the ""fun"", I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease while watching Battle of the Sexes. Riggs's brand of oafish misogyny is given just as much credence and lovability as King's high-wire emotional balancing act. The very real archival footage of sports announcers and commentators legitimizing his worldview is scary enough but because we get the inside scoop of who is essentially our villain, everything we see and hear is surprisingly easy to swallow. Even King gives him a pass in a climactic scene where she pits herself against USLTA President Jack Kramer, played with unmoving incredulity by Bill Pullman. ""Bobby's a clown but youyou can't stand that we want a little of what you got."" The film may have been better served if it was strictly from King's point of view. If that were the case, her budding relationship with hairdresser Marilyn (Riseborough) and deteriorating relationship with husband Larry (Stowell) could have been given the emotional honesty it deserved. What's more the film also lost out on the opportunity to comment on the ever growing, ever out-of-control media circus and our reaction as a culture to it. We now live in an age where late night comedians have the most cogent editorial viewpoints and our President is hinting policy changes like bumpers on a TV show. This is a conversation we should be having and I'm surprised and disappointed this movie didn't take a swing at it.Once Battle of the Sexes builds to its final showdown, the film's shallow iconography starts to crump up like badly pasted wallpaper. It is at that moment that you realize that what matters most to these two people, tennis, is probably the most boring sport to watch other than maybe golf. It doesn't help that co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris limit their camera placement to the obligatory ESPN whole-court wide shot, and an even wider shot where people are watching the match on TV.At a time when this kind of polemic misogyny is becoming more publicly commonplace, I'm surprised this movie was as big of a bad serve as it was. Then again if you're making an LGBTQ-oriented sports biopic with an award-winning cast and it somehow comes across as shallow, I gotta wonder if you're not just ticking marks on your Oscar-bait scorecard. Oh well, I guess the circus marches on."
60,Battle of the Sexes,8,15 October 2017,Stone and Carell shine,"BATTLE OF THE SEXES (2017) *** Emma Stone, Steve Carell, Andrea Riseborough, Natalie Morales, Sarah Silverman, Pill Bullman, Alan Cumming, Elisabeth Shue, Eric Christian Olsen, Fred Armisen, Jessica McNamee. Stone and Carell shine as 1970s tennis aces Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs who took on the world of tennis (and the world at large) in an iconic tennis match with the closeted lesbian fighting for women's rights and the comical male chauvinistic pig attempting a comeback after a series of setbacks. Filmmaking couple Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris give a well-balanced effort in allowing their protagonists to be well-rounded largely thanks to a smart screenplay by Simon Beaufoy."
61,Battle of the Sexes,9,15 October 2017,Good Fun Entertainment,".... And a bit of historical nostalgia and a nod to BJK's contribution to our society's two-steps- forward- two and a half- back progress in attaining equal rights and privileges for... well, everybody. Great acting, as we've come to expect from Carell and Stone, and good story development. They did what I thought was an odd thing with the tennis scenes and I get why they did it but it felt off: they slowed down the action to look like what I see when I'm out on the local courts watching pretty good players duff around. Professional women regularly clock speeds of 120mph on their serve and the power of their returns would blow your mind. The producers made it look like a weekend amateur could manage a volley with either of these pros. Very unrealistic, which is the only reason I subtracted a point!"
62,Battle of the Sexes,8,9 November 2017,The old misogynistic attitudes have unexpected relevance now!,"Written by Simon Beaufoy and directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, Battle of the Sexes shows the lead-up to the famous 1973 tennis match between world number one women's tennis player Billie Jean King (played by Emma Stone) and former men's champion Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell). You even get a bit of Howard Cosell, though filmmaking magic. In 1970, women tennis players received far less (about a tenth, I think) prize money than the men, because, as the head of the lawn tennis association explained (Bill Pullman again), women's tennis is just less interesting. King led a walkout, and the women left the association to form a new league. With Virginia Slims cigarettes as a sponsor, they had their own competitive tour (ironically, none of them smoked), managed by highly entertaining Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman) who does. In that context, Riggsa hustler and clown, playing tennis costumed as little Bo Peep, complete with sheep, wearing swim fins, and the likesaid he could easily beat the best woman player. ""I love women,"" he says, ""in the kitchen and in the bedroom,"" an attitude, unfortunately, newly topical. King takes up the challenge. While she trains, he cavorts. Home life isn't simple for either of them. Riggs's wife has left him, tired of his gambling, and King, though married, has her first lesbian relationship. At the time, public knowledge of that might have destroyed her career. Emma Stone does a fine joblikable and focusedand Carell is a believably driven character, teetering on tragedy as comics convey so well."
63,Battle of the Sexes,7,4 October 2017,It's A Bigger Story,"Everyone wants to make this about a woman beating a man at a sport. It's not. It's about equality through spectacle. There is absolutely no difference between a rock band and a girl rock band in terms of draw. They get the same audiences in terms of volume. As does men's and women's tennis. Guess what? That means the pay should be the same. That's exactly the case being presented. Given any spectacle event, men and women will draw in a crowd. So everyone SHOULD get paid the same. This, I can agree with. It's hard numbers.The movie itself is pretty damn good. Emma Stone plays Billie Jean King, a competitor who is at the edge of the lesbian/bi she will be known for. And Steve Carrell (which, there is no way he won't be nominated for an Oscar) is Bobby Riggs, the brash, fun loving degenerate gambler square off about men vs. women (in name only). In reality, this was probably a sham. But what a great sham. Even if Riggs did throw the match, everyone still got their money's worth. Some people paid to see King beat the loudmouth pig, others to watch Riggs put a woman in her place. Guess what, both sides drew the crowd. And I can't make it any more equal than that Fun stuff!"
64,Battle of the Sexes,8,24 September 2017,Relevant & Entertaining with Topnotch Performances,"Watching a good movie is always a joy. Watching a true story that helped shaped history is a greater joy. And watching repugnant male egos being taken down is priceless. 'Battle of the Sexes' tells the real life saga of the iconic tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs that was about so much more than the sport. I'm not old enough to remember the match but I've seen images and read articles about a group of women, and one in particular, who put their all on the line for equal rights. Even though I knew the end result the movie still gave me an immense high thanks to the wonderful storytelling, incredible performances, and the legendary life of Billie Jean herself.In 1973, Bobby Riggs, a former world champion and full time hustler challenged the number one ranked Billie Jean King to a game that took on a life of its own. Widely considered to be one of the biggest sporting events in history the tennis match signified everything Billie Jean and her colleagues fought so hard for- equality. The actual match doesn't take place until the last 20 minutes of the film and that, for me, is fine storytelling. You spend time with these characters and explore their personal lives. Their frail and failing relationships. Her struggle with her sexuality. His gambling addiction. And then there's the chance to rewrite history. For Bobby it's about showing off and getting the last laugh and dollar. For Billie Jean it's a matter of gaining respect for every woman who has ever been made to feel inferior. The narrative beautifully meshes the coming to terms with one's self storyline with an exhilarating sports drama.Emma Stone is marvelous as Billie Jean King. One year after her Oscar winning performance in 'La La Land' she shows her strength once more in a role which is easily one of her best yet. Steve Carrell is hysterical as the over-the-top Bobby Riggs. He's unrestrained and seems to be a having a ball playing a chauvinistic pig. Ms. Stone and Mr. Carrell are a solid duo that ground the film with their acts. Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris have created an entertaining and upbeat movie that uses humor and heart to tell a tale that's as relevant today as it was decades ago.A lot has changed in the last 44 years and a lot hasn't. The rules of equality bend far too often. We live in a time when a girl is shot for going to school and a woman's dress is considered more scandalous thanwell, anything else. The road to equality and social justice is filled with many such battles. You can watch one of them here.https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com"
65,Battle of the Sexes,8,24 September 2017,the game that turned a King into a queen of her times,"Unless you are a baby boomer, chances are you know very little about the feminist milestone that attracted one of the biggest audiences in the history of sport. In September 1973, 90 million people around the world watched a 55-year old former men's tennis champion take on the 29-year old No 2 ranked women's champion in a $100,000 winner-take-all tournament. The dramedy bio-pic Battle of the Sexes (2017) tells the story of a repressive era when women were routinely put down and lesbian was a dirty word.Chronic hustler Bobby Riggs (Steve Carrel) had seen better days but was still active on the men's senior tennis circuit. At the time, professional sport was a man's world and Riggs was a professional loudmouth and self-promoter who publicly ridiculed women's tennis. He stumbled onto an idea to challenge any woman player to a match, and then soundly defeated the world's Number 1, Margaret Court. With an over-sized ego, he hiked up the prizemoney and world Number 2, Billie Jean King (Emma Stone), accepted the challenge. Sport, politics and crooked money was part of the scene, but the public only saw and got excited about the symbolism of gender war. They were oblivious to Billy Jean King's struggle with her sexuality and the pressures of keeping it from her husband and the world. The match would make King a queen of her times.This is a wonderful story, told with the right mix of irony, humour and pathos. It captures the mood of the 70s with all the fashion trimmings, the mood for change, and the fears of men as they saw patriarchal power sinking under the tide of the feminist movement. The dramatic tension rises steadily as the narrative moves towards the final battle, with the softer story of King's love life interwoven but never intruding into the bigger picture. Steve Carrell's portrayal of Riggs captures the obnoxious claims of masculine superiority that were trumpeted in the 70s, but he is unconvincing as an athlete who can play against someone half his age. On the other hand, Emma Stone is simply brilliant. She embodies the deep inner doubts of someone who has risen beyond her own expectations while dealing with the inner turmoil of discovering her attraction towards women. The filming style uses the hand-held effect judiciously, and there are several macro close- ups of Stone and her hairdresser lover that are beautiful. While she plays King with nerdy understatement, she also shows steel resolve in taking on the male establishment in the interests of sportswomen everywhere.Billy Jean King's achievement in raising the status of women's professional sport deserves to be enshrined in the annals of feminism, as well as sport and cinema history. It was 43 years ago and many today will look at the story as a distant time-capsule of male chauvinist history. But of course, we know it's not over. The uncouth masculinity represented by Riggs still exists, even in high places, but is now called 'boys' locker room talk'. Battle of the Sexes is both an entertaining and an insightful portrait of an unfinished war."
66,Battle of the Sexes,10,23 September 2017,"Exhilarating, moving, and even, in a way, healing","Exhilarating, moving, and even, in a way, healing. Billie Jean King is an icon and a badass and her story is so satisfying. Emma Stone & Steve Carell deliver brilliant performances. Emma is totally convincing as a woman caught between complicated desires and societal restrictions. I laughed, I cried, I came out energized, moved, full of admiration for the people who do what they love and change the world."
67,Battle of the Sexes,8,2 October 2017,Recommended,"I enjoyed this movie! Great performances by Carell and Stone, the best I have seen from her. One critic said the romance between Billie Jean and Andrea was slow to get rolling but I disagree.You don't have to be a tennis fan or expert to enjoy the matches.I am curious about the setting for the climactic match. The real match was in the Astrodome which has been shut down for some years. Perhaps one of our experts can please tell us where and how that part of the movie was filmed.R rating is appropriate IMHO."
68,Battle of the Sexes,7,27 November 2017,An entertaining and fairly nuanced feel-good flick which promotes equality and fairness.,"'Battle Of The Sexes' is ultimately a feel-good flick with important messages of equality and fairness, which in the process manages to paint all its principle players in an equally fair light by presenting each of them as nuanced, non-demonised individuals with valid reasons to do the sometimes immoral things they do (a thread that runs through both quote unquote 'sides' of the eponymous battle), even, to a certain extent, the more one-dimensional background and side characters who's chauvinism (and otherwise closed-mindedness) is more a product of ignorance or unwitting fear of change than malice (as is usually the case), and it's in the film's unwillingness to pass preachy judgement on or talk down to half of its audience that it ironically finds its ability to actually resonate quite a bit, as any right minded individual should see straight through the now silly-seeming sexist seventies sensibilities (even if a lot of people are still somehow stuck in those backwards-thinking ways today); but it does have a lot to get through and, as interesting and relatively unique as most of it may be, it does make the film feel far longer than it actually is, lending to an occasional meandering vibe that does dampen the experience slightly and make you wish it was tightened up just a tad (yet it is fairly difficult to identify exactly which bits would be the first to go), and there's also very little of the focal sport on display outside of the fantastic finale, which does a great job of being exciting and accurate while maintaining clean choreography and camera-work which allows all of the action to be seen distraction- free, yet the feature still constantly uses its sharp script and excellently free-flowing direction to immerse you into both its period-setting and the lives of its core characters, allowing it to be consistently entertaining and highly enjoyable despite its few flaws. 7/10"
69,Battle of the Sexes,7,1 October 2017,"The Battle of the Sexes is a timely, well done period piece.","The Battle of the Sexes: An AceThe new film directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and written by Simon Beaufoy is a loving tribute to a tennis great. But it's not King's tennis that gets the majority of the play, though she won 39 major titles in singles, doubles and mixed doubles, it's her record at decreasing income equality in her chosen vocation. At the end of the movie, the changes in LGBQT rights since King became an advocate were highlighted as was the change in pay for woman players, but her record breaking tennis career is not highlighted in the epilogue. The plot is brisk but it doesn't rush. One problem is the sections featuring Billy Jean King were far more interesting than the sections with the tiresome and sexist, Bobby Riggs. It's not so much that Emma Stone's performance as King outdoes Steve Carell as Riggs, it is that Riggs ""is a clown"" and very unlikable. Carell does the best he can with a very unlikable yet not a sinister, male chauvinist. He's not even the antagonist of the film. It is the overriding sexism in the sport regardless of the popularity of the women players that is the villain here. And the issue of pay equity is still relevant. The supporting cast is stellar. Sarah Silverman is a much better actor than I would have expected. And Bill Pullman's Jack Kramer, the sexist head of the American Tennis Associate, is a delight. It's also fun to see Alan Cumming in a role he get to sink his teeth into. Jessica McNamee as Australian tennis great Margaret Court does a good job portraying her homophobia without going overboard. I credit a good script for that. The costumes are spot on. The music is timely. The sets are period, 1970s chic. The conflict between chauvinism and feminism are realistic. The attitudes played authentic. All in all, the film works as a period piece regarding an important issue. There is not much to the movie. It doesn't overplay the material, try to make a grand statement, or become testimonial to equal rights. It is the right size and stays on task with the help of a good script and an impeccable performance by Stone as Billy Jean King. Rating: Pay Full Price. It's not perfect, and the character didn't always act the way I wanted them to. But I can't blame the plot. That's real life for ya. Peace, Tex Shelters"
70,Battle of the Sexes,8,1 October 2017,"Perhaps, one day...","I saw the Battle of the Sexes on TV back in 1973, as 29 year-old Women's Tennis Champion Billie Jean King played 55 year-old Bobby Riggs. Back then I wasn't so much a tennis fan, more a boxing fan mostly because of my Dad. The Battle of the Sexes was certainly not Ali versus Frazier in The Thrilla in Manila. Billie Jean smoked Bobby's ass in straight sets. I remember Billie Jean as strong and pretty. I thought Bobby was a joke and a jerk. That was history from at least my perspective. History and perception make Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris's 2017 ""Battle of the Sexes"" great and somewhat hollow. Writer Simon Beaufoy's screenplay is best when it focuses on the ""battle"" within the sex as Billie Jean reconciles her own sexuality and risks being in love. Emma Stone as Billie Jean King is sublime and so very human. Awesome performance. On the other end of the narrative spectrum Bobby Riggs was a con man, really the joke and the jerk. As much as Steven Carell authentically inhabits Bobby with verve and arrogance, he's locked in. Beaufoy paints Riggs as pathetic, and we just can't empathize with jerk. Poignant Elizabeth Shue as his rich suffering wife does little to reveal his lighter humanity. Dayton, Faris, and Beaufoy vilify others too. Bill Pullman plays the legendary tennis great Jack Kramer with insidious charm and snark. Unlike Bobby, who plays the WWE role like Hulk Hogan, Kramer's discourse about women is sadly sincere. Kramer truly believes that men are better than women, not only as athletes, but as people. I don't know if this is an accurate representation of history. Women Tennis Champion Margaret Court, tightly wound Jessica McNamee, is the unsympathetic homophobeeven before this was a distinction. It is the human story of Billie Jean that touches in ""Battle of the Sexes"". Alan Cummings is amazing as the gay wardrobe designer Ted Tinling on the WTA Tennis Tour, who is aware of Billie Jean's awakening. The married Billie Jean (Stone) embarks on an affair with hairstylist Marilyn Barnett, radiant Andrea Riseborough. Simply, Marilyn may have been the first kind person to acknowledge Billie Jean as ""pretty"". In the heartbreaking scene, her husband Larry, played by handsome vulnerable Austin Stowell, discovers the betrayal. Larry is the descent good man. Cummings's Ted cautions Stone's Billie Jean, ""Be careful. The world can be unforgiving."" Seeking equal pay, Billie Jean and her promoter Gladys Heldman, wonderfully strong Sarah Siverman, choose to leave Jack Kramer's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) to form the WTA and the eventual Virgina Slims Tour, legitimizing Women's Tennis. However, WTA's reputation is threatened when retired Tennis Hall of Famer Riggs defeats Margaret Court in an exhibition match. Aware of the 'big picture', Billie Jean asks Larry to set up the tennis match with Bobby, but on her terms. She also has her own match raging within. In their heart touching conversation, she says, ""You're a good man. He says, ""You're a good woman."" She replies, ""Not always"" There is a wonderful scene as Billie Jean and Marilyn drive along the Malibu coast. They listen to Elton John and Bernie Taupin's ""Rocket Man"". Fortunately ""Rocket Man"" doesn't have the same connotation it has today. In Bernie's lyric: ""I'm not the man they think I am"" We should all have the freedom to be ourselves. That is the underlying message of ""Battle of the Sexes"". The actual tennis match in ""Battle of the Sexes"" is no big deal. It is the impact of the social consciousness of the times that resonates. Cummings's Ted gently hugs Billie Jean after her victory, and says, ""One day we will be free to be who we are"" That touched my heart. Perhaps, one day. It's possible."
71,Battle of the Sexes,8,30 September 2017,Not All Scripts are Created Equal,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A film that always entertains, but loses some ground about gender issues by simplifying the issue.SYNOPSIS: The true story of a tennis match that became a national debate over equal rights for women.You've come a long way baby...or have we? That the underlying premise in this perfectly named new film, Battle of the Sexes. Based on a true event in 1973, a televised tennis match-up between men vs. women became a minor brouhaha which questioned inequality claims between both sexes. At the center of the controversy were sport stars Billy Jean King and Bobby Riggs, for those younger moviegoer who may not be familiar with this challenge. The hype and showmanship intrigued a nation , with increased salaries demands for women, ongoing gay issues, and Women's Lib advocates joining forces in a male-dominated world. The tennis court became the staged arena for the fight to begin.￼More glitz than a true competition, the actual anti-climactic event is interesting fodder and Ms. King became a crusader for women's causes while Mr. Riggs took over the role as male chauvinist pig and outrageous buffoon. Their lives rarely intertwined. He, a debt-ridden middle age has-been on the tennis circuit; she, in her prime, one of the world's top-seeded tennis players and popular feminist. Both paths collide amid wild period details, from the wide lapels, shags and long sideburns, mini-skirts, bell bottoms and primary colored prints. (Special mention goes out to production and costume designers, Judy Becker and Mary Zophres.)But beneath the hoopla is a more dramatic story-line, one of homophobia and gender inequality that lays dormant. The directors, Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, have fun with the media circus aspects of the sporting game and allude to this issues, but the focus of the screenplay by Simon Beaufoy alludes to their back stories with an unequal balance between the two athletes' personal lives. ￼Equality may be the goal here, but there is definitely more screen time and depth given to Ms. King's character and story than Mr. Rigg's demons, A gambler and part-time hustler, his problems aren't written with much clarity. The role seems superficially drawn and his dilemmas are not given the full treatment that this more complex character deserves. One wishes there were more of an equal partnership with the script and the filmmakers took a more serious stance about the material. Both actors look physical right for the roles and work very well together when screen time allows. Steve Carell tries to valiantly fill in the gaps, but he still comes off as only a bumbling foil to a classier Ms. King. Emma Stone is wonderful in this better-written role and the actress skillfully shows her grace under pressure by contrasting Ms. King's inner strength within her professional life and her vulnerability and confusion found in her personal odyssey. ￼There is strong support by a fine ensemble that includes Sarah Silverman, Alan Cummings, and Elisabeth Shue, with memorable turns by Natalie Morales as King's teammate, Rosie Casals, Austin Stowell, as Billy Jean's devoted Ken doll of a husband, and Andrea Riseborough as her love interest. Bill Pullman plays the nasty card very well as sexist tennis promoter, Jack Kramer.Battle of the Sexes may only be a small skirmish of sorts, but the film is still a highly entertaining engagement that captures another era very effectively and makes us realize that there is still much work to be done, present day included."
72,Battle of the Sexes,7,29 September 2017,"Great Script, Well Directed, Decently Acted","Being a man of a certain age, when I hear ""Battle of the Sexes,"" my mind immediately goes to the famous tennis match in 1973 between Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King. In a world where the media circus was still in its infancy, the promotion of this match would be on par with some of the crazy events that are put on today with the only difference being the more pressing social morays that were being challenged here.Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valarie Faris, who brought us ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" Emma Stone plays King and Steve Carell Plays Riggs in a script written by veteran scribe Simon Beaufoy to bring to life a very complicated story that goes WAY beyond tennis. It begins with King (at that point being the first female athlete to earn $100,000 in a single year) and her manager, Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman), informing the U.S. Open that they will be boycotting their tournament due to there being a very large gap in the prize money between the men and the women. In doing so, they form their own tour, which would become the long-standing Virginia Slims Tour, building it from the ground up. During this time, Riggs is struggling to keep a day job working for his father-in-law and unsuccessfully keeping a promise to avoid gambling with his wife, Priscilla (Elisabeth Shue). As the Virginia Slims Tour grows in popularity, even attracting another of the biggest names in the sport in Australian Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee), Riggs decides he wants to do a ""Man vs. Woman"" match with a huge payday for publicity. And all of this is happening as King struggles with a life change that could not affect her but also the entire sport she has worked so hard to make viable.The biggest thing for me here is the strength of the script. This story is told in a way that is completely and totally engaging while being respectful to each and every one of its characters. Riggs is shown as a man who constantly is on a hustle but wants to still be his own man, out of the shadow of his in-laws without having to be stuck in an office the entire time, while King is shown as a woman who feels the weight of the world on her shoulders (whether justified or not) that she doesn't want to burden those closest to her with and realizing what direction fate is beginning to take her in. (As a side note, this is a great companion piece to the HBO documentary from 2006, ""Billie Jean King: Portrait of a Pioneer"".)The main reason I spent so much time talking about the greatness of this screenplay is because it covered up for me the fact that I never really bought either of the leads in their roles. This is not to say that I did not enjoy Carell or Stone; quite the contrary: given who they are with minimal makeup or prosthetics involved, they both did serviceable jobs. I just never really lost the actors into the roles here, with Stone and her signature lisp constantly reminding me that it was her and Carell trying not to be Michael Scott from ""The Office,"" but also realizing the amount of that character that lies in Riggs himself. For me, the standouts lie in the very brief but poignant work of both Alan Cumming and Wallace Langham as the costumers for the Virginia Slims Tour, who are in this film at very pivotal moments and carry their parts of the story incredibly well.""Battle of the Sexes"" is another one of those stories that is just as important now as it was almost forty-five years ago, as it deals with equality, overcoming barriers, and simply being okay with who you are. I don't know how this will fare in early 2018 in a year with some VERY strong contenders for the awards it will compete against, but this is a film that is very well presented with a story even better told."
73,Battle of the Sexes,7,28 September 2017,the complexity of billie jean,"Greetings again from the darkness. At least two generations are too young to have experienced the 1973 media circus that was the tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. However, what matters is that the impact and social changes that began in earnest that night at the Astrodome are still being felt and evolving today. It might seem incredulous that the 29 year old top-ranked women's player emerging victorious against a 55 year old who played his last professional match 14 years prior would have an impact on anything other than TV rankings, but in fact, it caused a significant societal shift.Real life married couple and co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris are well known for their collaborations on iconic music videos and TV commercials, and since joining the movie world have brought us LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and RUBY SPARKS. Their talent for visual presentation is on display here in both the tennis scenes and the more intimate character moments. And, oh my, there are some intimate moments thanks to the script from Oscar winning screenwriter Simon Beaufoy (SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE). There is no shying away from Ms. King's sexual confusion/awareness/preferences. Emma Stone (Oscar winner for LA LA LAND) stars as tennis legend Billie Jean King and manages to convey three different sides: the ultra-competitor, the champion for equal rights, and the married woman coming to grips with her sexual identity. Steve Carell captures the essence and mannerisms of Bobby Riggs, the former tennis champ, floundering in middle-age and always on the lookout for his next hustle or gambling opportunity. Surprisingly, only a minor portion of the film deals with the actual tennis match. Instead, the film dives into the personal lives of these two polar opposite personalities, each with their own challenges and issues.Despite the fun and outrageousness that the Riggs character delivers, the film might have been better served focusing even more on Ms. King. While she needed the ""villain"", it was really her dedication to the cause and strength amidst the backlash that made the difference  along with her court skills. Watching her stand tall in confrontations with the chauvinistic and powerful Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman) is something to behold. Again, those that weren't around might not believe some of the outrageous claims by the men of the times.Supporting work comes from Andrea Riseborough as the all-important Marilyn, who turns Billie Jean away from her husband Larry (Austin Stowell), Sarah Silverman as promoter Gladys Heldman, Natalie Morales as Rosie Casales, Alan Cumming as the colorful clothes designer, an underutilized Elisabeth Shue as Riggs' wife, Fred Armisen as Rheo Blair  Riggs' partner in the herbs and vitamins game, and Lewis Pullman (Bill's real life son) as Riggs' son, Larry. We are even treated to a Bob Stephenson sighting as the Sugar Daddy PR guy at the match.This was the era when the Vietnam War was winding down, the Watergate scandal was raging, outside ""the norm"" sexual preferences were kept in the closet, prize money for men's tennis was 8-10 times that of women, and the overall respect for women and their sports was excruciatingly misguided. Listening to Howard Cosell speak so condescendingly during the national broadcast merely confirms the inequity. Of course, these same issues are discussed and debated even today, as society evolution is often slow, even when moving in the right direction. The film might not add much to today's cause, but it reinforces the early legacy of Billie Jean King as a difference-maker."
74,Battle of the Sexes,3,21 December 2017,Full Blow of Super Boredom,"I won't go into the matter of the ""messages"" of this movie. If watch a movie I want (besides maybe some message) first of all entertainment - if I want to expand my intellectual skills I read and I don't watch movies, tbh, most movies (and movie scripts) are mostly done by at most mediocre intellectual minds - actors or script writers or other people involved into the movie bizz are for me not a reliable or strong source for ""brainfood"". In short: Battle of Sexes has two main issues, first of all the real-life story itself is boring, and second, the movie is also boring. I like Emma Stone a lot as a skilled actress, but even she can't save this movie that got only one thing done well: boredom.This movie I can only recommend to you, if you want another dose of p.c.-speech. Everybody else - avoid or get yourself tortured to a real brainfreeze ;)"
75,Battle of the Sexes,8,26 November 2017,Good match for Emma Stone and Steve Carell,"Solid biopic and strong film about feminism about a topic that still today is extremely relevant. Especially in Hollywood, that is why the film is absolutely right for this time. The performances are strong. Emma Stone gives one of her absolutely finest performances. She was perfectly right for that role and understood every nuances of her character extremely well. Steve Carell was the fantastic as well. Not only physically right for the role but he also understood how to bring some self irony and humor to it. Possibly the best performance of his career. Also the supporting cast was great casted. Andrea Riseborough was fine. It was good to see Elisabeth Shue again but she was a bit wasted. Sarah Silverman was a scene stealer as expected. Bill Pullman and Jessica McNamee were noteworthy as was Alan Cumming, especially in his last scene. Great moment. The 70s soundtrack was a great addition to the otherwise great score. The screenplay was fine, although it was a bit too straight forward at times as was the direction, but at least very effective. There were some slow moments but maybe only for someone who is not really into tennis (tho the match scenes were really exciting due to the drama). Good and important film."
76,Battle of the Sexes,7,25 November 2017,Battle for equal treatment NOT supremacy you idiots,"King is not exactly accurately depicted in this male-style (threatened) titled film. However, we know sexism persists and, if we ever would be offered a documentary style film of the true story, ye ole fashioned men would take (uninformed and prejudiced) umbrage and refuse to watch it, fund it, you know everything....at all. So we have to wade through a lot of drivel suggesting 'saintly' super understanding Mr King understanding without comment that Billie might have shared her bed with another woman. Well, that's about as believable as the constant and inconsistent prop swapping re Billie's aviator style then Joe 90 style specs...in one frame the former, then the next the latter. Make your minds up prop people and stick with it. There were lots of other irritating prop failures but they at least provide a puzzle solving activity whilst the treacle story gloops on. Oh, and a note to the foley guys, perhaps you should check out the sound of a real Rolls Royce on ignition. RR's are renowned....yes renowned the world over, for their quiet running....always have been. Why insert the stupid roar of a Mustang or similar. Kills the effect guys! King was a game changer....this film ought to reignite the battle for equal treatment that is constantly undermined by dinosaurs who would never lose anything if they could only find and open their minds. Shame this isn't quite as good as it deserves to be. The two principal actors are well chosen and do their best. Credit for them."
77,Battle of the Sexes,9,22 November 2017,The movie lives up to the importance of its subject,"I really liked the movie. I went into it not knowing exactly what the plot was. I wasn't all too familiar with the Billie-Jean King topic. All I knew was that it had something to do with Tennis and women's rights. Emma Stone and Steve Carrell are among my favorite actors, Emma especially in recent years because she has gotten the opportunity to fully show her acting skills. Also, the whole set-design and mask was great. It really felt like an authentic 1970s environment. The movie went straight into the plot right at the beginning which I liked because it almost never became boring. I do remember one or two moments that were a little out of the movie's pace, but it was nothing too frustrating. I liked that everything seemed authentic. King's concern for women's' rights, the male counterpart with their huge egos, the side affair (which took up a surprising amount of the film) with her hairdresser, addressing her sexuality. Everything seemed in-tune and I had the feeling it was well put-together. Camera work wasn't too special. I would call it solid, so it's not a major turn-off for me. Sometimes it might have been a little too ordinary, but that's not a huge deal compared to the rest of the movie.tr;dr I loved the actors, the setting and the plot; cinematography could have been a little better. 9/10"
78,Battle of the Sexes,,18 November 2017,Excellent film,"Battle of the Sexes was an enjoyable and well made film. Emma Stone showcases how she is an accomplished actress by portraying Billie Jean King in this film. She looked stunning and very much the part. Steve Carrell does a great job as the outspoken, jovial and outrageous Bobby Riggs. Two great Tennis players were displayed in a great battle based on true events. From the stellar performances, story, directing and great soundtrack this film hits it out of the park. It also had an important message of equality and advancing the rights for all. Billie Jean King was a unique case for this as a female who was unique in many respects. To the haters who disliked this face off and pointed out that Billie Jean King beat a retired 55 year old man, I guess you missed the point. It posed the question that perhaps she, the top female player, should play the current top male player instead. Which logically would lead to her, a woman, actually being good enough and on the same length as a man if she should be compared to him. Regardless of who would win or lose, equality and fairness should exist such as the same prize money. Great performances, this film was a treat to watch and was engaging all the way through. Arguably one of the best films made this year. 8/10"
79,Battle of the Sexes,9,29 September 2017,An up to the minute look at gender equality through tennis,"This tells the story of the Bobby Riggs' 'The battle of the sexes' tennis competitions in the early 1970s, where ageing former Wimbledon singles champion Bobby Riggs plays current female tennis champions, including Margaret Court and Billie Jean King. You don't need to like tennis, because the game is just the vehicle used to great effect to provide a current day look at social mores of the 1970s  with all the bias, male chauvinism and downright bigotry. The film is particularly pertinent in Australia today, with our non compulsory postal 'survey' on same sex marriage that the national government is under no obligation to enact legislatively, regardless of the outcome. Emma Stone and Steve Carell are just marvellous as Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, and Jessica McNamee makes an impressive Margaret Court. Alan Cumming almost steals the show as legendary clothing and set designer 'Ted' Tinling, with a major steering role in the social commentary of the narrative. The look of the film took me straight back to my year 12 end of school feelings, both positive and negative. The screenplay by Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog millionaire) feels just right, with the openness of chauvinistic attitudes and the tensions for the professional tennis circuit laid bare in a compelling way. At 2 hr 1 min, it's a bit longer than many contemporary films, but it didn't outlast its welcome for me. Do yourself a favour and go see this highly entertaining, thought provoking film. It's uplifting in how far we've come, but reminds us about how much opportunity for fairness remains."
80,Battle of the Sexes,,28 September 2017,Entertaining if liteweight,"The title is a bit of a misnomer. Yes, the epic televised match between Billie Jean King (Emma Stone) and Bobby Riggs (Steve Carrell) is the climax of the film, however, this is really King's tale with Riggs as a significant supporting player. And, it's quite the enjoyable ride.Right from the start, we are plunged into King's battle to give more equal stature (and pay) for women tennis players. We begin with King leaving the governing tennis body and striking out on her own to form her own tour with many of the then top tennis pros on the circuit. As is that weren't enough of a burden, a hairdresser (Andrea Riseborough) puts the moves on her forcing King to have doubts about her sexuality. She is married to Larry King (NO! not that one), who, it turns out, is the most understanding of cheated on husbands. During the meanwhile, Riggs is stuck in a marriage to Priscilla (Elizabeth Shue) that is being torn apart by his wreck-less gambling. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE Directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton guide the film along in an enjoyable and reasonably brisk pace. Simon Beaufoy's script compliments their style. The period details are fine, and shooting it on 35mm & 16MM film adds to the authenticity (and, even the old TV footage aspect ratios are respected - an increasing rarity). The climactic match is engrossing even if it can't quite transcend the standard 'Big Game' clichés. The whole film is a fairly old-fashioned style bio-pic with a few modern touches. The actors are all good even they are more than a little hamstrung by some pretty obvious story contractions, hard to swallow coincidences, stereotypical behavior and character traits (did we really need the supportive gay friend?). Still, one can't help but be stirred by the finale. Women in the theater were weeping with happiness. Some, not doubt having watched the actual TV show back in the day. Others, just grooving to the history lesson. No since HIDDEN FIGURES has there been such a feel good major release on the big screen. It may not be a three set sweep, but, it's still a winner."
81,Battle of the Sexes,9,5 October 2017,Well done.,"Even though Emma Stone and Steve Carell don't look too much like King and Riggs, they convey the characters in a way that's believable and entertaining. The directors use Carell to perfection--the silly clown is visually surprising and fun to watch, along with a sadder side that isn't over- done. Emma Stone's portrayal of King has a subtlety that lasts in this viewer's mind. She displays the quiet determination of an athlete along with the emotional hesitance in dealing with her sexuality back in 1973. The actress playing her lover is British, playing an American, and she's very good. Elisabeth Shue has aged impressively --she now looks like a beautiful, middle-aged matriarch of an old, powerful family. In fact, all the faces in this movie are interesting to watch, as people of the 70s, and finally, just as people."
82,Battle of the Sexes,8,2 October 2017,Technical Excellence ... Source material very good,"Clearly made by very talented people but the story it's based one keeps it from being an all time great The acting was superb, especially Emma Stone and Steve Carrel. Emma's mannerism's and facial expressions transformed her into a whole other person. Being a kooky eccentric center of attention is a role that Carrel has played before so a transformation wasn't quite needed but it fits him well and he did a good job.The filmmakers did a good job of taking advantage of the 70's setting. It was a treat to see the fashions, technology, architecture, etc. The soundtrack and sound mixing was probably the strongest part of the film and I hope it gets recognized when award season rolls around.The camera work was strong with some close tight shots that really conveyed the emotions on the screen.Overall, you get the sense that this movie was made by some of the most talented people in the industry. With that said, someone about the movie did not grab me or move me. I guess I'll blame the source material. Something about Billie Jean's story failed to grab me. Perhaps it's the lack of compassion I had for either of the main characters. Neither had it that bad, neither was facing odds that made you want to root for them, and both did things that were of questionable morality. When the climax rolled around, I just wasn't invested enough to care about the outcome. It was an interesting story and I was never bored. With that said this is a well made movie. It is better than 90% of the stuff out there and if you want to see great acting shot with great camera work on top of a great sound track in a visually interesting setting then go for it."
83,Battle of the Sexes,7,27 September 2017,VIEWS ON FILM review of Battle of the Sexes,"In the past, movies about the sport of tennis have ranged from mediocre to bad to ridiculously stupid. I'm talking 2004's Wimbledon, 1979's Players, and 1986's Jocks. Thankfully, Battle of the Sexes (my latest review) is better than the aforementioned.Based handily on a true story, ""Sexes"" depicts the events leading up to the famous 1973 tennis match between Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King. Battle of the Sexes also illustrates the match itself. Wooden rackets, short shorts, an audience of 90 million worldwide, a Houston Astrodome venue, it's all there. In retrospect, ""Sexes"" is a good film but it doesn't quite achieve greatness. It lacks excitement simply because Billie Jean's routing of Riggs was sort of lopsided. All you gotta do is look at the wiki page and know who won beforehand. I was pumped to see this thing based on its meaty trailer with Elton John's ""Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding"" blaring in the background. In the end though, anti- climatic and blase are some of the words I'd use to deduct points from my rating for Battle of the Sexes. I will endorse this flick but it only wins half the ""battle"". The positives for ""Sexes"" are obviously the acting of the cast and the direction of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine). Emma Stone and Steve Carell are excellent in the leads. They dive into their roles as King and Riggs with veritable aplomb. You also have sturdy supporting work in Sarah Silverman. She goes unrecognizable with the part of Gladys Heldman, the founder of World Tennis Magazine. As for the portrayal of Marilyn Barnett (Billie Jean's hairdresser and secret lover), Andrea Riseborough is all aces (ha-ha) giving a warm and subtle performance. I can't predict the future but I'm hoping that all four of these actors get nods from the Academy come awards time. It's only September so yeah, that may hurt their chances.In regards to Dayton and Faris (mentioned earlier), well they shoot Battle of the Sexes in a flask, dream-like state. Their look is grainy and they use plenty of rack focusing. Basically ""Sexes"" almost achieves the feeling that you're watching something that was actually made in the 70's. The tennis scenes look authentic, the period detail is adequate, the awareness of time and place works, and there's a sense that you're always peering in on any trouper and their woman's lib/male chauvinist situation. Overall, ""Sexes"" is not entirely about a tennis teeming. It's more a character study and/or a backstory via the lives of Riggs and King in 73'. The outcome of their three sets featuring drop shots, volleys, and lobs, might have changed woman's tennis for the better. But hey, where's the fire here. A positive assessment for me but a muted result at best. Of note: I usually recommend movies that have historical gravity anyway. Rating: 3 stars."
84,Battle of the Sexes,8,30 September 2017,"A film of culture, equal rights, and the fight for freedom and quality of expression.","""Battle of the Sexes"" is one film that captures the times and culture of the early 1970's well as the look and music of the film made the viewer feel right at home, and it showcased the women's movement just fine. A lot of underbelly themes are shown here those being the most important messages of the film as all of it leads up to the icing on the cake with the classic and legendary tennis match between female all world tennis pro Billie Jean King(in one of Emma Stone's best roles)and male hustler Bobby Riggs(Steve Carell).Yet underneath it all and behind the scenes this movie is more than just a tennis match it's coming to terms with acceptance and the rise of equal rights and a revolution for women and a rise of times and culture shifts in gender roles. And plenty of sexism and the fight for equality is felt during the film and discovery of sexuality is shown with Jean King finding she's a lesbian and Riggs has his own vices and struggles of gambling which cause him to lose his wife.Really a good film and period piece of courage, and fighting for what's right and feeling good and coming to terms with who one is no matter who they love or what sex they are, ""Battle of the Sexes"" is a stand up winner and a rise of expression and it makes all feel equal."
85,Battle of the Sexes,7,30 September 2017,Battle of the Sexes (2017),"You know what's funny? Both Emma Stone and Steve Carell have been around forever, but it's not until recently where they started getting high plaudits for their performance. Not a tennis fan but I could always do a biopic especially one with a great cast. The film is a thrilling dramedy about an event that's fairly relevant even today. We know the result but it's still a joy watching the steps to getting there.The film is about Billie Jean King, a high ranked tennis player recently ejected from the league because she stood up for equal pay for women competitors. A gambling man and also fellow player Bobby Riggs challenges her to a tennis match. Riggs is quite the showboater, using denigrating and sexist remarks to sell the fight. The film also shows how Billie Jean King was an early feminist and struggled with homosexuality, thus leading to her celebrated status as a gay icon.I don't always love sports films. Some I can stomach, others are tune out films. This one was built incredibly well. First of all, this film features very strong Carell and Stone performances, arguably the best of each of their careers. Stone completely embodies King and becomes her character. The film offers a visually authentic representation of the early 70's and the costume and set design complements the time period well. The film uses comedy and the situation of the time and characters well to build up to the glorious tennis battle.The film is quite clearly a representation of the issues we still deal with today. I don't know how accurate the events and the commentaries expressed in the film are (I tend to think its a close representation) but they mirror issues of the modern day. This is a strong feminist biographical film and on top of that it also deals with LGBTQ issues. No surprise that Billie Jean King became a feminist and LGBTQ icon as a sports star. Its still early days but this may be up there for acting performances at the Oscars at the end of the year. Its easily the most unique and challenging performance Emma Stone has had to do.7.5/10"
86,Battle of the Sexes,7,4 October 2017,A Triumph of Feminism in 21st Century America,"Battle of the Sexes featuring Steve Carell (Bobby Riggs) and Emma Stone (Billie Jean King) is a must watch for you all feminists out there (I'm with you). It is a motivational story of Billie Jean King, the former World No.1 Professional tennis player, and her journey to fight for women's equality in professional competitive tennis while discovering her sexuality and being the best tennis player in the world. Although the Battle of the Sexes is historically focused only on the match between Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King, this movie tells a story of King's growth despite failure and her endless fight against the sexual bias in tennis at the time. This movie is directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, a married couple of music video directors, along with the fact that this movie is of biography/sports genre so there shouldn't really be much expectations towards the use of camera angles and the beauty contained in specific shots. Even though for some stationary shots, the camera is noticeably shaking to a minor degree, the film as a whole could still be appreciated as it is. The story told by Battle of the Sexes is what stands out from the other biography/sports movies. The casting of Steve Carell and Emma Stone is perfect as they bear shocking resemblance to the real-life Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King, and the acting from both stars are also fantastic. Billie Jean King's story to strive for sexual equality is very relevant in today's world where underlying sexism exists throughout our society. Although the movie overall's theme is optimistic and motivational, there are times where Steve Carell's accurate portrayal of Bobby Riggs just hits the audience right where it hurts. Historically accurate quotes and statements such as ""Men are the superior animal"", ""I'm not saying women don't belong on the court, who picks up the balls otherwise?"" or ""Don't get me wrong, I love women, in the bedroom and in the kitchen, but these days they want to be everything"" from Steve Carell rings a bell for the audience today, giving us a reminder on the sexism that existed back in the 70s and how it should never make a comeback today. It also hurts me personally that Steve Carell are saying these things because to me, he is Michael Scott, forever and always. There is a lack of character development in the film, but considering it to be a non-fictional film, it is thus understandable. Nevertheless, some sub-story lines are left unanswered by the end of the film and I think could be better addressed to give the audience a better understanding of the situation at the time and show what an amazing woman and tennis player Billie Jean King truly is, to be able to create the Woman's Tennis Association, have equal pay for men and women's tennis tournaments, and beat Bobby Riggs, the former tennis world champion."
87,Battle of the Sexes,2,14 January 2018,Really ??,"Given the pretty decent reviews, my wife and I were looking forward to an easy-watching amusing rental movie. We were prepared for a certain level of PC, sermonizing and revisionism but this did not turn out the be an issue. What was, however, was the acting, direction and script. Not to mention the choice of music in some of the scenes. Steve Carell seemed to be playing .... Steve Carell. And a 1-dimensional version to boot. Emily Stone - a fine actress - was bland in the role of Billy Jean; and some of the other performances were worse. The dialog at times was banal but not bad enough to make this a truly awful and therefore high enjoyable move - cf. ""The Room"". My wife gave up halfway but I was determined to watch it to the end given that I had rented it from Redbox at a net cost of 27 cents after applying my coupon. However, I could not stomach anymore and had to quit just before the match. It is not often that I feel that I did not get value for money at 27 cents."
88,Battle of the Sexes,1,13 January 2018,Where's the Message to it?,"The true story of the 1973 tennis match between World number one Billie Jean King and ex-champ and serial hustler Bobby Riggs. Half Sexist, Half LGBTQ, All Forced Political Agendas and no offense but this New Generation? is so offensive to anything and with everyone and above all this film wouldn't even exist 10 years ago and as for the film or the story itself? It's garbage from the characters, to the actors perfomances to everything really but don't worry SJW will love it. (0/10)"
89,Battle of the Sexes,8,7 January 2018,Politically Correct,"Very well named ""Battle of the Sexes"". It is not the best feminist film project. Emma Stone looks amazing, modest and confident. It is one of her best performances. Steve Carell's character was kind of stupid, his character is contradictorily funny. He is a macho but at the same time he is being dominated by his wife. I really liked the shots in the tennis matches. It felt like a was watching a real match. Some arguments were a bit silly. The film in general is politically correct."
90,Battle of the Sexes,7,6 January 2018,An enjoyable nostalgic trip to the early 1970s,"Based on a true story: leading up to the famous 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King (Emma Stone) and Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell), the lives of each player are revealed. King fights to improve the status and pay of women tennis players while hiding from her husband an affair she is having with another woman. Riggs struggles with a gambling addiction which jeopardizes his marriage.One of the many successes of this film is its ability to recreate that fun, light-hearted era known as the early 1970s including terms not used for a long time (""women's lib"", ""male chauvinist pig""), glimpses of the wonderful ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and coin-operated televisions in airport lounges among other public places. It also reflects some early emancipation movements of that great era: the aforementioned women's liberation movement (expressed outwardly) and gay/lesbian liberation (expressed secretly).Another great point of the film is its compassion for everyone. During the grand match, the viewer sees the viewpoints of all involved. It's not a hero(ine) vs. villain situation. And speaking of the match, there is a wonderful build-up to it created by directors Jonathon Dayton and Valerie Faris. Even though the eventual outcome is known, there was tension and excitement leading to it. Another area of compassion is in regard to the love triangle. One particular scene seems to begin as a comical ""oh oh, you're going to get caught"" adultery moment but has a very surprising shift that ends, in a subtle way, with deep sympathy and sadness.Stone gives a strong, full-range performance of a living legend. There are moments of great vulnerability as well as fierce determination and courage when King is willing to take great risks to do the right thing. Stone's great work is really no surprise considering her superb work in last year's magnificent ""La La Land"".One area where the film could have been more transparent is in the allegations that Riggs threw the match as a way to pay off some of his gambling debts. Even if this is false (there is more evidence against this belief than in its favour), it ought to have been mentioned in the disclaimers at the end including the various claims against the allegations. But this does not spoil this fine film which is entertaining in its own right while recounting many important histories.... or is that herstories?"
91,Battle of the Sexes,9,6 January 2018,Nice reminder of our history.,"While the movie doesn't delve into all of the complexities of the life of Billie Jean King, it's a great start to getting the public aware of our history and it's a great movie to relive the 70s."
92,Battle of the Sexes,8,3 January 2018,Great sport story without too much of the sport itself,"Emma Stone and Steve Carell really pulled great performances in this one. Didn't know the real story of this before I watched the film, heard the names tho.The movie is not your regular sport movie where usually it's way too much just scenes of the actual sports, this one had much better ratio with the backstory and the sports itself, really appreciated that.Never before liked Carell's performances, but maybe this movie redeemed something back. Stone was brilliant as always, i bet she can't do anything wrong."
93,Battle of the Sexes,8,3 January 2018,A biography above the average,"I have a ""thing"" with biography movies, I usually find them borring, I think that in order to make a truly good biography movie you need a good filmmaker, and, well, this is one of the best I've ever seen.This is a really well acting movie, with Steve Carell and Emma Stone being great as always, well writing, and well directing movie. Noting here (besides the fact that is a movie that approaches a truly important subject these days) blow me away or something like that, but almost everything is made in a pretty solid way.I didn't have a previous knowledge of the story that the movie tells, so I was impress with the message that it pass, it's really cool, and also very important, to give the LGBT community the voice that they need, in order to make the world a more equal, and lovely place.Perhaps the only main issue that I have with the movie is that it really doesn't give much attention to all the LGBT thing, we have a real superficial approach in the challenges of being a lesbian in the 70's, but is really way superficial, and I don't buy the excuse that ""the focus is the tennis match"", no, it isn't, the whole point of the movie is (1) tell King's history, and (2) pass a message about equal right's (and that includes the LGBT, not just the Womens).But, looking at the big picture, Battle of the Sexes in a great movie, that pass a important message about equal rights."
94,Battle of the Sexes,9,3 January 2018,Funny. Emotional. All around terrific.,"I knew very little about the story of Billie Jean King or Bobby Riggs going into the theater, but coming out I found myself caring immensely for these two individuals. Watching Billie Jean slowly discovering her sexuality in the midst of all this personal mayhem she's going through in her tennis career, her marriage, the media, struggling for women's rights, and this very public rivalry with Bobby Riggs she has to keep up with. One of the best things about this film is the writing of Bobby Riggs who could have easily been portrayed as this 2-Dimensional villain like what he had been satirizing at the time. Instead he's written to be layered with charisma to spare. If you haven't checked it out, please do. It is touching, humorous, and even inspirational."
95,Battle of the Sexes,,31 December 2017,Enjoyable,"This film tells the story of a female tennis player who finds out that female players are offered a tiny fraction of prize money in tournaments when compared to male players. She sets out to prove that female players are just as worthy as male players, culminating in an epic battle with a former world champion.""Battle of the Sexes"" tells the life of Billie Jean on the tennis court and also outside of tennis court. I feel as if I get to know her a lot. I am very heartened by the husband's unconditional support, and I am quite impressed by his acuity when he sees an unusual item in Billie Jean's room. The banter between Billie Jean and Riggs is very interesting, and it proves that marketing is vital to selling tickets to a match. It is also very nice to see the film portraying her private life in a positive manner. I enjoyed the film a lot."
96,Battle of the Sexes,8,30 December 2017,"Good, but not the real story.","This was a very good movie and i recommend it;however, it doesn't show the true portrayal of events that was the ""Battle of the Sexes."" I wish it was more of a true to life film, focusing more on Riggs' gambling addiction and less on King's lesbianism. It is pretty much common knowledge that all of this was set up by the mob. Bobby was supposed to whoop Court, act like the biggest chauvinist in the world (e.g. Andy Kaufman) to generate tons of publicity; setting up a huge match against King, getting a huge TV spot and tons of action in Vegas. Bobby was then supposed to throw the match; which he did. I wish the movie would have focused more on the fix than LGBT rights, but it was a great movie, and this match did do great things for women's tennis (which I like more than men's tennis). Great acting, cinematography, direction, etc... It was inspiring, but truth be told, Riggs could have mopped the floor with her. Of course I have know proof of this, but as I said, it is pretty much common knowledge, and several people (witnesses) have come forth and admitted this match was most certainly FIXED. Good movie though; even better than ""Spring Fever"" in my opinion."
97,Battle of the Sexes,8,29 December 2017,A solid 8/10!,"This film, being what it is, was the most facinating tennis story to me in history, taking place in the 1970's. It had the sexism all women dealt with those days, a time which has changed to day for all women in the countries that support equal thinking.I want to rate this an 8.0. It is rare a movie shows history + homosexual love + jokeful sexism / serious sexism all in one, and comes out on the top of my 8's movie list, which is ... rather short a list I may add...Watch this with family, as its a great family film."
98,Battle of the Sexes,10,28 December 2017,Absolutely loved this film,"The reason I am writing this review is because I can't believe the reviews that I have read. Closed minds!
I can't fault this movie. It was well shot, fun, emotional and exciting! Steve Carrel and Emma Stone at their best as well as the rest of the cast. Fun Movie!!!"
99,Battle of the Sexes,9,28 December 2017,Someday we'll be able to be who we are,"I can never stand sports movies, because I hate sports. Remember The Titans? Nah, I'd rather forget. But Emma Stone was the main draw for me to watch Battle of the Sexes. I figured this movie would be different and my intuition was right. I did not know anything about Billie Jean King prior to watching the movie, so that left a lot of plot elements a surprise to me. I think that helped, but I still found the movie enjoyable enough to watch two nights in a row. I was taken by surprise to find out that Billie Jean falls in love with a woman, since as I said, I never knew anything about her. The fact that this happened in the 1970's when you just COULDNT be a woman in love with a woman and also be a celebrity sports hero at the same time is of major importance to understanding this film and empathizing with its characters. This movie is likely going to affect heterosexuals, particularly males, in different ways than it did me. Unless you are an empath or have been through what Billie Jean goes through in her relationship - the denial, the shame, the secrecy, the longing for freedom of expression ability to live authentically - you're not going to pick up on the nuances of this film as much, though you may still enjoy it. It's sort of like watching a movie about the civil rights movement when you were never oppressed - many have difficulty understanding what thats all about. Me on the other hand I got teary eyes by the end.I was very moved by Emma Stone's emotional, conflicted, yet resilient portrayal of Billie Jean as a young woman trying to change the world doing what she does best - tennis. I feel like it was a perfect part for her. I was also impressed with Andrea Riseborough, playing the role of Marilyn, Billie Jean's hairdresser. The main comedic moments in the movie come from Sarah Silverman's dry humor as Gladis, Billie Jean's manager, and Steve Carell as outspoken self described male chauvinist and tennis hall of famer Bobbie Riggs, but it is less of a comedy movie and more of a movie that happens to have a couple of laughs to break up the dramatic moments. The cinematography is colorful and nostalgic. They did a good job bringing the 70's to life again. The soundtrack is also perfect for the story.Maybe not one of my all time favorite films, but I really didn't dislike anything about it, and it has given me even more respect for Emma Stone as an actress."
100,Battle of the Sexes,8,28 December 2017,i'm the ladies number one..,"Battle Of The SexesWhile having her new haircut the lead actress feels attracted towards her hairstylist and so do we towards the characters floating around it; this is the match point in the movie scored majestically by Jonathan and Valerie. Even though Emma Stone is the main ingredient and she is excellent in her track, Steve Carell is the trump card here and he plays it off with a great conviction. Battle Of The Sexes is one of those rare sports movie that pumps the heart faster as it reaches for its final act."
101,Battle of the Sexes,8,22 December 2017,Beautiful Story Acted Well,"I really enjoyed this movie and how it humanized the actions of Billie Jean King, surprisingly however, Bobby Riggs turned out likable as well.That said, this movie is more about Billie Jean King and her contribution not only to tennis but society as a whole. She was a driving force in equality and a great athlete. This movie tells part of that story of her life.Before watching, the first review I read here complained that the movie focused on her sexuality too much. How is that so when that *is* her sexuality. Why are you complaining about an important part of her life? This movie is about much more than tennis."
102,Battle of the Sexes,8,21 December 2017,It's a good film but.,"The only hero you find in this film is BJK's husband. It does portray BJK as the selfish person she was, use anyone and everyone for your own purpose. The main storyline is true but stupid now as then. A female champion in her prime defeating a 55 year old misogynist ex-pro tennis player / showman does not liberate women, or improve their conditions. She'd have never tried against the young male pro's, she was no heroine alone, the other women deserve as much credit for their stand. But they weren't LGBT or whatever letters they use now, this film loves the gayboy dressers and BJK being a lesbian, it is as they say fake news."
103,Battle of the Sexes,7,19 December 2017,Film Review: Battle of the Sexes,"The match is set; a stand-off between a woman and a man; the man, a chauvinist who thinks he is better than any woman in the game of tennis; the woman, a strong, determined and ruthless competitor. The match already took place, in 1973 no less, yet the issues plaguing the game, the gender issues that were relevant then, are still relevant now, which is a problem. Regardless of who won (if you don't already know, you are a couple words away from finding out on Goggle), the real issue present is that a battle of sexes in 2017 shouldn't exist, but it does. So the question remains, who really won in 1973? While anyone born after 1973 don't really know anything about the infamous match between the macho-showman Bobby Riggs and female rights activist Billie Jean King, the newest film from directing duo Jonathan Dayton and Valarie Faris, the team that brought us Little Miss Sunshine and Ruby Sparks does a wonderful job of setting up a very relevant film for young and older people alike. While Battle of The Sexes misses the charm of Little Miss Sunshine and the imagination of Ruby Sparks, the flair that Dayton and Paris bring is a vintage stylistic that helps drive the narrative; even though the film doesn't really need it. While the film at times, seems to act almost identically to Bobby Riggs, played lively by Steve Carell, Battle of the Sexes is hardly a film about tennis, which becomes apparent quite quickly, and more about the build up of two very different individuals, using an infamous match for their own personal gain; one, financially and for monetary gain, the other, for change and action.Billie Jean King played by the nerdy and bashful Emma Stone, does have her spotlight within Battle of the Sexes. King, who is almost immediately labelled as the protagonist in the film, facing many personal conflicts that preens themselves annoyingly upon the build up of the iconic match. Stone, coming off her Academy Award for playing the tap-dancing, lovably heart-broken Mia in La La Land, brings an authenticity to King, a hard-hitting, truth telling, tough as nails professional tennis player who hardly takes no for an answer. Still alive and paving various paths for woman even in 2017, this vanguard of woman's rights explores ideas of lesbianism, true love and most of all, the equality of female competitive sports and their valour and level of respect that is already present in male sports entertainment.While Faris and Dayton do a wonderful job of building up their two main set-pieces, showcasing many of what may have gone right for one, and wrong for the other, the duo never really explore the dynamics of the tennis world and how woman and men were perceived in the seventies and how the sport has gone to change today. This is not to say, that I am a tennis aficionado by any means, but even today, woman and men play in separate leagues in tennis. So what does this say about the film? Does one triumph over the other? What changes did this match make and how did King progress her woman's liberation movement? Is tennis the one sport that women are paid equally to men?It is not shocking to see that, even without even doing any research, women's sports struggle to find an audience. Most of the televised sports are male sports, with the exception of the Olympics, that happen bi-yearly. Upon further research, I was not shocked to see that the top-seeded male tennis player averages a salary more than double the female top-seeded player. So, my one and only question for Battle of the Sexes is, what exactly has changed since 1973? Is this film another attempt to shed light on the very obvious gender defamation of female athletes? Why are women's sports not televised unless for special events? What are we doing to change this, other than making a very appealing and stylized film with some very attractive stars?While Battle of the Sexes does have very deep and powerful messages, as well as compelling speeches and monologues by both protagonists, the uber exciting and explorative final epilogue, full of images and captions about the change the match did to present day sports, Battle of the Sexes is a very anti-climatic inspiration sports story, with very little sports and more of a playful attitude towards change that could have been more relevant. The battle the film faces mostly, is the one deciding whether it is just a sports biography, or an agent of real change.Battle of the Sexes is a Hollywood film through-and-through. With immensely powerful and effective supporting performances from everyone involved, from Elisabeth Shue (a real tennis lover and an actress initially interested in playing King), to Sarah Silverman, who provides the majority of the film's comedy and humour, from the the women's side of the film. In addition, Andrea Riseborough does a wonderful job of presenting Stone's king with a very worthy distraction and is solid throughout the film; a real undervalued actress. My favourite supporting performance comes in the form of King's stylist Ted Tinling, played by the always wonderful Alan Cumming, who provides the film with the most authentic and relevant monologue of the film, although it is somewhat ambiguous.While Battle of the Sexes is nothing short of enjoyable and entertaining, sadly, the main battle the film fights with between two very talented and convincing actors, trying to possible vie for Oscar gold in 2018. Battle of the Sexes will more than likely NOT be a vehicle for Academy Awards attention, nor will it be an agent of change to the sports system and capitalist way people consume professional sports, which is sad, because the film has immense potential for being a driving force of positivity and peace. The battle is far from over, and the war between gender is just beginning, but the truth of the matter is, peace and resolution is the real ingredient needed to find some sort of solution for gender equality, not only in sports, but in the world as a whole."
104,Battle of the Sexes,6,16 December 2017,A well executed but not so ground breaking biopic,"Battle of the sexes was nothing particularly groundbreaking in terms of being a decent bio-pic, but good execution and brilliant acting from the two leads certainly elevated this film to be a delightful and enjoyable time. Billie Jean King's story is inspirational and certainly sets an example for gender equality but overall there really isn't that much more to the story itself. The source material is not so rich and as a result there wasn't much the story can go to. But I must say with the material that they have Battle of the Sexes certainly executes this story to perfection."
105,Battle of the Sexes,8,10 December 2017,A thoroughly engaging sports biopic which is about much more than tennis,"I was lucky enough to attend the premier of the documentary The Battle of the Sexes (2013) which dealt with the same subject as this film. Billie Jean King was present and spoke afterwards and I can safely say she was extremely inspiring and likable. The documentary itself was stellar stuff and highly informative and entertaining. So it was with great interest that I approached this movie version, a sports docudrama about the 1973 'Battle of the Sexes' where King was challenged by washed-up ex-champion Bobby Riggs to a winner takes all match. Unbelievably, this tennis match proved to be one of the most watched sports television events in history, which probably says quite a lot in itself. In the event, the match was an easy win for King in sports terms but it was much more challenging personally and psychologically, as it was a significant stepping stone on the path to gender equality in tennis, a sport which was anything but equal at the time.The film mainly focuses on King, with Riggs more on the periphery. This is a very good thing, as she is the key presence here, with Riggs something of a comic sideshow, albeit a sideshow with a decidedly unpleasant undercurrent. I thought Stone's underplayed performance was brilliant and really captured King's unshowy persona very well, I haven't seen her better in all honesty. Carell impresses too in what is a comic performance with a dramatic anchor. If anything, the movie somewhat presents his Riggs in a more favourable light than he truly deserved, as in reality he acted a little worse, such as when he defeated Margaret Court he began humiliating her by serving to her underarm  none of this made the movie version for some reason. Still, some of Riggs essence is still intact; King after all says she did actually like the guy just not what he represented here.You could say there are three threads to the story. The aforementioned match of the title, King's formation of the Women's Tennis Association after it splits from the Lawn Tennis Association over a massive pay divide between men and women and a married King's exploration of her attraction to other women. I thought this last part was dealt with in a really good way with an especially touchingly emotional love scene between King and her hairdresser. This plot element very much fleshed out the story and showed that there were so many taboos, hurdles and battles to be fought in those days. The time period is recreated beautifully in all its early 70's glory, with fashions, colours, music and television all perfectly evoked. I am a sucker for this kind of detail so I basically give a couple of points for this straight off the bat. Lastly, I have to also mention that Sarah Silverman delivers a charismatic and hilarious performance as King's manager. Acting in general in the film is very good from the entire cast though.At the end of the day, while I might still rank the documentary as being marginally better, I think this film more than does it and the estimable King real justice."
106,Battle of the Sexes,,6 December 2017,God bless Billie Jean King,"Being too young in 1973 to understand the social and political significance of the tennis match played between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, I watched this film to understand more of the context in which the match was played. Both Emma Stone and Steve Carell play their roles very well and you really feel you are watching the embodiment of the characters of Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. The film's pacing does drag in the love scenes especially as the viewer was enticed originally to buy their ticket for the tennis match than the love story. Billie Jean's sexuality is important to understanding her character progression but the long lingering dreamy shots of Stone and Andrea Riseborough just go on a bit too long.The film comes alive with the match build up and the grainy film and hand-held camera technique for the tennis scenes give the film a nice sense of sports documentary realism. The match itself was filmed brilliantly well and is thrilling to watch.The supporting cast do a good job but this is ultimately Stone/Billie Jean's film. Just imagine what it must have been like for an independently minded sports woman in 1973 battling sexism from all quarters including her own fellow players like Margaret Court and Chris Evert who predicted Riggs would win. The fact that Billie Jean conducted herself during the build up to the match (Riggs playing every sexist card he had during it) with grace, warmth and charm is a feat in itself.The Battle of the Sexes is a really important film. Billie Jean King changed forever women's tennis by challenging the sexist status quo of women being paid a fraction of the amount paid to the male players. She did this by sheer force of will and had to overcome the tennis authorities and the sporting elite of the time. The only criticism I have of the film is why did it take 44 years for this important historical event to be captured on film? Modern female tennis players owe everything to this tenacious feisty warm woman."
107,Battle of the Sexes,8,28 November 2017,Battle of the Sexes  Where are you with equality?,"Sports documentary drama, a true story set in 1973.The premise was that women were no match for men in the world of tennis and as such the men's prize money was generally 8x the women's. Billie Jean King questions this but is faced with resistance to make it the same, she decides to form her own Women's Tennis Association.Bobby Riggs is a hustler, he challenges BJK to a match with mega prize money. This is Women's lib vs. male chauvinism match.The film sensitively explores each of their personal lives, Bobby Riggs is a hustler and gambling addict, BJK questions her own sexuality and has a lesbian affair with her hairdresser.Time for a quick observation / rant  what do you think might happen if the world number 1 female tennis star at the time, at peak fitness and with total determination was to play a retired male former champ, who was out of shape, twice her age and with personal issues on his mind? I won't let this influence how I felt about the film. Don't get me wrong, there were great performance from the two lead actors I really liked the film and I'm a believer in equality but not sure this did much to support the cause.Recommended."
108,Battle of the Sexes,7,15 November 2017,"Billie Jean King then, Hope Solo now","The makers of this film can send a thank you card to Harvey Weinstein. Because of the #metoo-movement, the film now has extra significance. If it weren't for Weinstein, this movie would be a nice nostalgic trip down memory lane, to those long lost times when men were proud to call themselves male chauvinist pigs.As it is, the Weinstein affair has made it impossible not to make comparisons between then and now. Women now make millions in the professional circuit, but their colleague soccer players don't (although the Norwegian women's team has tried). What's more, they have to cope with men 'grabbing their asses', as US goalkeeper Hope Solo puts it.'Battle of the Sexes' shows how seventies tennis player Billie Jean King had to fight against prejudices and gender discrimination. The culmination of this fight is the show match against Bobby Riggs, a fifty-something has-been of the tennis circuit and, yes, a self declared male chauvinist pig.Both King and Riggs have their own problems. His is an addiction to gambling, and the problems this causes in his marriage. Hers is her budding love affair with a female hairdresser, and the problems this will certainly cause in her marriage.This juxtaposition works very fine, because the characters of the two leads are so completely different. Riggs is a showman who mixes bravado with stupidity and recklessness. King on the other hand is smart, determined and dead serious. In a way, it's a pity that the film is based on a well-known historic event, otherwise the outcome of their battle would have added lots of suspense.Both parts are played well, but I particularly liked the way Steve Carell plays Riggs as a man you love to hate. Beneath his abject behaviour towards women like King, he is deep down a nice person who just loves a good laugh.Because of the character development of King and Riggs, this is much more than just a sports movie. In fact, there is relatively little time spent on actual tennis playing. It is a piece of American history, recreated for the big screen. 'Battle of the Sexes' isn't cutting edge cinema, but it is a well made, entertaining movie about a subject that is still hotly debated."
109,Battle of the Sexes,8,20 October 2017,"Great Performances, But Has Some Pacing Issues","The trailers gave us the impression that this movie would be a joint effort by both Steve Carell and Emma Stone, but this is truly Stone's movie. She gives a really good performance here, and certainly leads the film. I don't think it necessarily tops her Oscar winning performance in La La Land, but it is a remarkable one nonetheless. She brings a lot of the realism and the subtly to the movie, whereas Carell adds the complete opposite. All the positives I stated before about Carell taking on the role of Bobby Riggs was validated. He very much has the Michael Scott-isms that make him such an unstoppable comedic force, but he also incorporates some of the dramatic elements we've seen from him before in movies such as Foxcatcher. And really, I don't know if this movie would have worked if Carell was a co-lead. He is so eccentric and so out there that I think the shtick would have gotten old and annoying really fast had he been in as much of the movie as Stone was. By making Stone the lead, you have a much more grounded entry into the film, and Carell's performance is enhanced by it only being a supporting role..."
110,Battle of the Sexes,8,23 October 2017,The 1973 mixed tennis match reflects America's current social politics,"This replay of the 1973 tennis match between Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King serves as an ode to the America Donald Trump is killing  and a prayer for its revival. The two leads' intros are revealing. Billie Jean appears as a montage of action shots. Her vitality shows her as blur. Riggs paces alone in his high, empty office tower, an ex-champ now a supernumerary for his rich wife's father. Riggs itches to do something, anything, to recover his lost glory, to reaffirm his superiority as a man. In his bragging, bluster, vanity, arrogance, misogyny, showmanship, moral emptiness and ultimate futility, Riggs is a Trump figure. To both, anyone afflicted with responsibility, modesty and humanity is a loser. Riggs hijacks a Gamblers Anonymous meeting to nourish their addiction, not to address it. His clowning barely conceals his lack of self-respect and moral core. Against Riggs's transparent insecurity and empty macho strut, Billie Jean projects a confident, competent, spirited servant to the public good. She's an icon of two revolutions in America, that Trump is in the process of reversing.Her revolt against the male-dominated tennis profession is an assertion of women's right to equality, in treatment and in salary. Jack Kramer embodies male superiority. The women's purse should be one twelfth of the men's even though the women's games attract equal audiences. Kramer lives by that double standard, flattering women while suppressing them. Their egos clash when Billie Jean refuses to play the big match if he is Riggs's commentator on TV. Kramer claims she won't have the nerve to abandon the match if he performs. She responds in kind: He won't have the nerve to see it cancelled because of his refusal to step down. She wins that one, then  spoiler alert  the match. She wins with precisely the qualities Kramer says women lack: physical strength, the ability to perform under pressure, and control over her emotions. Her post-game private weeping shows she has the emotions that ennoble a woman  and the discipline to control them. She also has the stamina and rigour Riggs's game lacks. Of course that calumny is what women continue to face in business, politics, academia, wherever the fraternity is too frightened to give women even a taste of the privilege and power they have traditionally enjoyed. Remember Trump's mock concern over Hillary's stamina then his collapse into a golf cart at his first summit meeting. In the second revolution, Billie Jean's first lesbian affair emphasizes her iconic role in sexual identity politics. As her gay designer consoles her, soon America will let people like them love whom want to, how they want to. A postscript details her activism for LGBT rights and the close relationship she maintained with her ex-husband throughout her later gay relationship. His swagger dissolved, Riggs is bolstered by the return of his wife too. The designer's optimism proved true  for a while, until Trump's current betrayal of the women and LGBT that as candidate he pledged to support.As Riggs is portrayed here, he has one appealing quality Trump lacks. Riggs acknowledges his needs. He knows he needs the thrill of gambling, assurance that he's not just a kept man, his sons' respect and his wife's  well, at least her presence. Trump is too childish to have even that self-awareness. How will this film play? I think most viewers will enjoy the drama, the humour, the emotional engagement. But there will remain that radical division between the conflicting views of what exactly made America ""great."" Billie Jean's side will say America was great for promoting equality, liberty, opportunities for all, the right of everyone to realize what they individually are. From the women's ambitions, independence, presumption, sexual freedom and equality of rights, the Trump side will recoil in fear and disgust. This vision of the States Formerly Known as United is how that 1973 mini-drama reflects and addresses America today."
111,Battle of the Sexes,9,21 October 2017,Good movie with poor advertising.,"Great dynamic drama but absolutely is not a comedy.I got so much than I expected with this movie. For one, it was actually good. The characters are all very deep and their story lines are compelling and woven together with grace and skill. No character is a caricature of themselves which I find rare in most films. The love and relationships play as legitimate and real. But this is not at all a funny movie. It's amusing at times to be sure but comedy it is not. If you want to laugh out loud, pick something else. If you want to enjoy a surprisingly good drama, this is your film."
112,Battle of the Sexes,8,5 October 2017,This whole flick comes off as one giant ad for Virginia Slims Cigarettes . . .,". . . (the initial sponsor of Big Time Women's Tennis), which is fitting since BATTLE OF THE SEXES documents how Billie Jean King developed into a perhaps fatal tumor or cancer on the Face of America. Before Billie Jean, America had the two Biblical Sexes, and made the best of it. Since Billie Jean, the sexes have been splitting and splintering into ever-tinier Sub-groups Willy Nilly, and now there are potentially 340 MILLION shades of gray in this crucial area of the USA's Reproductive Life. Regular America is Mad as Hell about this situation, and is showing signs of Rebellion. Compared to Major League Baseball or the National Football League, the so-called ""sport"" of tennis is a mediocrity. Tennis' prime venues struggle to attract crowds in the hundreds, compared with MLB or the NFL easily packing people into stadiums by the tens of thousands. The MLB and NFL Meritocracies have NO sex discrimination by-laws, but NOT ONE female has had what it takes to earn her place among History's Hordes of MLB and NFL players. Women lack the essential ingredient to be featured in sports people want to watch: The Ball Park Frank. (Since we're speaking frankly, this of course is why Leader Trump silenced all the Talking Heads with his triumph in November: He has a Ball Park Frank, and his candy sass opponent does not.) When viewers see the Truth about Billie Jean during BATTLE OF THE SEXES, they'll find out that she was NOT a Credit to Either her Race or her Sex!"
