0,Songs from the Second Floor,10,3 February 2005,Bizarre and brilliant,"SONGS FROM THE SECOND FLOOR is honestly one of the best films I have seen so far in my years of cinematic appreciation. Alice, below, nailed it in her analysis, and there's little I can add that would be useful. I also agree with the critics who compared it to what would happen if Monty Python set their sights on Bergman. The film is both a character study and a meditation on humanity, filled with transcendent moments of beauty that left me completely stunned. It is also a biting satire of corporate greed and its effects on society, and the search for hope in a dying, empty world filled with people who've basically given up. SONGS is a great film that everybody should see."
1,Songs from the Second Floor,,15 March 2001,a modernist masterpiece,"One of capitalism's favourite pretences, especially when making bogeymen of alternative ideologies, is that is is natural, the obvious orientation for any society, the inevitable result of progress, while all other systems are theoretical, foreign, applied.  'Songs from the Second floor', which could be subtitled 'Fall of the Western Empire', takes this assumption literally , and makes late capitalism the natural environment in which its drama plays itself out.The ethics of capitalism are figured in architecture, in the way people compartmentalise and miniaturise their lives, the way they treat other humans, the mechanical way they move.  The film's look is updated Kafka - the nightmarish bureaucracy, the endless corridors, where the individual is arbitrarily humiliated, furtively watched by a frightened audience behind adjacent doors.  The recurrent motif of the film, besides the endless triangles, is of frames - there is not a single composition that doesn't give onto other frames: windows, doorways, corridors, elevators, streets, etc. - like a kaleidoscope, the mere switching on of a light can radically reconfigure these spatial arrangements.  This might seem to open up a very claustrophobic world, suggesting another world beyond the rigid frame we watch; rather, it creates a hall of mirrors effect, one world reflecting itself, in a whole city, society, culture - a never-ending repetition of the same lifeless tableaux that comprise this way of life; a prison literalised in the infantilising case of the senile military commander.
Because this way of life is made to seem natural, feeding into the very buildings in, and gestures with, which people live, its collapse is not sparked by an external force, but results in an implosion of the environment, buildings toppling, the ground tilting like a sinking ship, the body, mind and society breaking down, a whole world grinding towards sterility and inertia.This is where Andersson's career as the 'world's greatest advertising director' (dit Bergman) comes in.  Normally a career in advertising results in films of glossy shallowness.  Andersson takes a theme of Fellinian decadence - think 'Satyricon', 'Casanova', 'Ship of Fools' - where a sophisticated society begins to decline, where immutable buildings begin to crumble, crowd hysteria is let loose, where public rites frame primitive barbarism (the sacrifice of young girls to appease the pagan gods) are all filmed like an Ikea advertisement, full of antiseptic sheen.The film could be described as 'The FAst Show' directed by Bunuel.  The narrative consists of connected, but self-contained vignettes or sketches with a recurring set of characters.  Most of them would be simply funny jokes in a TV show - the magician who really saws a volunteer's chest etc. All have the concentrated brevity of an advert, all the visual imagination and surprise necessary to capture the viewer's attention.  But what the film is advertising is the decline of a soulless consumer society, a society where the minimalist surroundings reflect minimalist humanity, where human relationships (especially in families) are grotesquely alienated.Despite its post-modern sheen, the film's source are very - gloriously old-fashioned modernist or classic auteurist - Fellini (especially the scene at the airport, where the  escapees are bogged down by bulging luggage), Dreyer (the sensitive poet gone mad because of his society); Godard (the apocalyptic traffic jam and barbaric bourgeois behaviour); Antonioni.  BUt the presiding spirit is Bunuel, with the 'Milky Way'/'Phantom of Liberty'-like surrealist picaresque narrative, full of bourgeois-baiting and random violence; the 'Exterminating Angel' scene where the civic and clerical worthies are paralysed in the hotel, frothing like distempered dogs; the perverse anti-clericism that convincingly creates a vision of hell climaxing in an ambiguous scene of resurrection (the crouching crowd in the fields) and despair (the rubbish heap of crucifixes).What Andersson truly shares with Bunuel, however, is a skewed comedy, never letting the Big Themes get in the way of the rich detail - the wonderful scene with the tramp, rats and ex-girlfriend especially.  For all its alienated style and dehumanisation, 'Songs', like Bunuel, is devastatingly, humanly angry, and somehow very moving.  the meticulous smoothness of the filming actually creates an oppressive violence in the viewer, a desire to smash the whole glasshouse down."
2,Songs from the Second Floor,8,13 June 2003,"""Slapstick Bergman"" indeed","One critic described this film as being ""Slapstick Ingmar Bergman"";  it's a great joke, and in many ways a true one.  I've never seen a movie like this before, and I haven't laughed so hard at one in years.  Every single scene has something off-beat or funny happening in it, so that you may want to see it more than once.  (I watched it twice in one day!)  The best bit occurs when the businesspeople decide on a rash course of action to save the faltering economy.  I won't spoil it for you but trust me, it's one of the blackest comic moments in all of film.  Don't miss it!"
3,Songs from the Second Floor,,10 August 2004,Cartoonish,"Spoilers herein.No, this is not cartoonish as the term is commonly used to mean simplified or childish. Instead, I mean it as stained glass artists did to imply the evocation of something by merely providing the outline.Such cartoons were considered magical, giving meaning to something not by actually defining it, but by defining what separates it from the rest of the world. It is a special kind of abstraction, not one normally used in art and even more seldom (alas) in formal systems. Here it is done effortlessly and effectively.This is not a `surreal' film, as many have described. I suppose they mean to say it is strange. But surrealism is the creation of worlds whose underlying mechanics or metaphysics are different, other than `real.` The art in surrealism is usually focused on what isn't different.This is instead abstraction. The objects in this world are a bit strange but the whole point is that the underlying physics is the same to which we are subject. The art in such cases is usually a matter of insight by strange light. This bears more resemblance philosophically to Roddenberry than Bunuel.And that qualifies it as serious enough to pay attention to. Past that point, I abandon it. That's because it really is true to the Bergman tradition that imparted despair is a worthwhile endeavor. Not for me.But I must admit that the last scene is really very fine. Few movies know how to end, and almost no one does it well. This, my friends is done well. I can recommend sitting through the entire thing then stopping right before that last scene. Take a few days and clear your soul, refreshing yourself. Then go back and experience the visitation of all that has come before, but this way you can see it as the stained glass it is and not a morbid essay on gloom. This is a world, incidentally where you (the camera) does not move, but the buildings and meadows do.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
4,Songs from the Second Floor,,28 February 2001,an extraordinary examination of a society not so far away,"I have only seen this movie once and that is certainly not enough. The pictures contain more than our perception can handle. The general impression of the film is however, that Roy Andersson has performed a splendid diagnosis of our society, a society whose individuals no longer communicate, no longer interact. He shows us the result of a system that proclaims egoism and neglect. The message is clear: Only together, people can find a way to endure the tragedy of life, only together, we can enjoy the small fragments of happiness that life offers.I encourage all non-Swedish people to see this film, 99,84% of the world population is not Swedish. This movie concerns all of you."
5,Songs from the Second Floor,10,8 January 2002,wonderful and  touching movie about the misery of human life,"This film makes you probably sad and depressed, but it is a wonderful and touching movie about the misery of human life: the ultimate loneliness and hopelessness, which we do not like to think of, but have to face. As the film is based on poetry (by the to me unknown Cesar Vallejo), it does not have a straightforward story. Rather, it is a collection of scenes that all move you at an emotional level, as you see the vulnerability of all the people. The film is moving from reality towards surrealism, although you could see the strong surrealistic pictures as the real and hidden nature of our society, which fails to offer any help to these eternal problems. I should probably go to see this movie again so that I could grasp more from its symbolism, enjoy its excellent and unique film-making, and last but not least to feel it again. This film does not give you hope, but perhaps it makes you more sympathetic to other people, let them be alcoholics, immigrants, old, stupid, mentally ill or just simple ""boring philistines""."
6,Songs from the Second Floor,8,30 April 2004,Sweedish Opera,"Songs From The Second Floor has been described as a poem put to film, but after viewing this emotional work of art, I can't help but to feel that a Swedish Opera put to film is a more accurate description.Directed and written by Roy Anderson, Songs From The Second Floor is a visual and emotional masterpiece. Showing Swedish and to a greater extent all of society, through grey colored glasses. The cast primarily consists of non actors who made an impression on Roy upon him seeing them in everyday life. All of whom make similar impressions on us the viewers upon seeing them in this film.Kalle (Lars Nordh) is the heart and star of this movie. It's through his story (one of several) that we fully experience this Swedish Opera. The pain, sadness, guilt, and hopelessness of Songs From The Second Floor, can be felt in every slow moving moment of his life.Religion, love, poverty, and poetry are all common themes throughout this film. Giving it an identity all of it's own. You could watch a hundred films with similar descriptions, and still consider Songs From The Second Floor the strangest and most original film you've ever seen......Highly recommended for those who liked Northfork and Russian Ark."
7,Songs from the Second Floor,10,26 May 2003,A breathtaking masterpiece,"I would just like to say that, those who don´t like this movie must have a heart of stone and a mind that´s so blocked that you can´t see the connections to our society and the ways of man. Our loneliness, our longing for love, our inability to communicate. This film broke my heart, but at the same time it was a wholesome experience, and I was glued to the screen for as long as it lasted. I will never forget the pictures from this film, they still linger inside of me. It´s just so beautiful.I recommend everyone to see this film! If you´re prepared for an inner journey.(And I know that some people are afraid of this kind of ""deep"" stuff)Not if you just want entertainment for the moment. If you want to see an action-loaded flick or a nice love comedy instead, fine, do so. But I say: If you´ll only see one and only one more film in your life, see this one!"
8,Songs from the Second Floor,7,28 April 2002,Very well made but depressing allegorical satire.,"This film won the prestigious Cannes Film Festival award in 2000, and it is indeed very well made. But damn, it's not what you'd want to take someone to on a date. Unless they have odd tastes.Songs is a kind of allegorical black comedy about capitalism and the brutalising effects of modern society. The cast is mainly depressed middle-aged men in bad suits and there are multiple storylines and little scenes that all add up to one big condemnation of the Western world: a man who hasn't missed a day in 14 years and decides to go to work rather than have sex with his wife, then gets fired. A poet/taxi driver driven insane by the misery around him. His father, who burnt down his store for the insurance and spends most of the film covered in soot. You get the picture.
The film is full of powerful symbols, like a heap of cheap plastic Christs being thrown onto a rubbish heap, or the eternal traffic jam, and moments of absurdity that made me laugh out loud, such as when the Swedish high command gather to honour a retired commander who is so senile his bedpan gets emptied while they give him a speech. But the even the humour is bleak - there isn't a single happy moment in this film. Frankly I didn't buy it. Life may sometimes be dull, bad things do happen to good people, capitalism can suck, but it just isn't that awful. Forgive me for getting lyrical, but life is too full of hope and friendship and beauty to get sucked down in to this grey, dreary view of the world.RATING: 7/10"
9,Songs from the Second Floor,,28 November 2000,A great tonic for those tired of formula,"Of the 11 films I saw at this years Vancouver International Film Festival, this was one of the best. Definitely not a film for the masses, but if you're tired of seeing so-so hollywood formula and you and don't mind a shot of bizarre, then this is the film for you. I doubt it will come back for a commercial run, as it is not the kind of film the multiplex crowd would appreciate. If, however, like me, you are a fan of Terry Gilliam and don't mind a slower pace, there is much to recommend this film. Made up of a series of short vignettes, some related and some not, it weaves a story of apocalyptic chaos. A story some of us were expecting to happen Jan.1,2000.The unmoving camera stares into the lives of a society on the brink. Maybe ours in the near future. A movie that will demand discussion afterwards.A bomb shelter in the blighted landscape of Californication."
10,Songs from the Second Floor,,12 September 2004,brilliance.,"i am taking the time to write these few words only as a contradiction to a pathetic comment i have stumbled upon when surfing the site for details on ""songs from the second floor"". without intentions to carry out a lengthy and tiring essay on this marvelous cinematic work i only wish to say that the sheer brilliance of this movie will linger on in the mind of every serious cinema lover long after it's actual experience. ""songs"" is a tour de force of cinematography and 'mis en scene' . the splendor of it's frame compositions , the complexities of it's visual perspectives, all are a cinephile's pleasure feast. packed with sharp humor as well as deep philosophical themes , this film is a must for anyone who is touched by visual art ."
11,Songs from the Second Floor,,26 May 2004,Wonderfully darkly funny and incomparably Swedish.,"Possibly incomprehensible to those who have never lived in Sweden, where whole hours somehow manage to lose themselves in a meditative calm that exists nowhere else. Songs from the Second Floor is truly Ingemar Bergman meets Monty Python, as Roy Andersson non too gently deflates the pretentious, the pompous and the self important. The sparse dialogue and hugely tongue-in-cheek solemnity will either offend the spectator to the point of rage, or scratch the itch that nothing else quite reaches. I adored it. Like raw oysters, broccoli or goat milk - you'll either connect with the Roy Andersson brand of iconoclastic insanity and love this one ... or you'll hate it with a passion. There'll be no fence-sitting with this Nordic treasure."
12,Songs from the Second Floor,10,5 October 2001,The best,"Never before has a picture been so visually perfect.It's so beautiful, poetic and genious!!Everytime you see it you can notice something new in it!!!If you liked this film you got to see Roy Andersson's first film ""En kärlekshistoria"". It's really hard to find but when you do it will be worth the effort."
13,Songs from the Second Floor,10,27 August 2001,An impressive examination of alienation,"""Songs from the Second Floor"" - the film's American title - is an incredible accomplishment. Its control in juxtaposing vast cityscapes and crowds with dimly-lit ""quiet desperation"" scenes is impressive. The film brings to mind the work of Kieslowski, Fellini, and (I'd even venture) Beat Takeshi - a world of flat surfaces, cold doorways, stone-faced mobs, and vast churches, train stations, and mental institutions that occasionally, and with great artistry, become the backdrop to scenes of hilarious deadpan humor or incredible humanity.The biblical element is strong here, but, as with many great modern works (think Ulysses), biblical stories serve more of a narrative purpose than a moral one (mild spoilers ahead). The story centers loosely around a Job-like figure (he's covered with literal ashes in several scenes); a crucifix salesman goes for the millennial hard-sell (claiming champagne is already oversold); white-clad mental patients debate the character of Jesus. Despite the transgressive nature of some of these takes on Christianity, though, the movie is never sacrilegious simply for the sake of being so. Its take on the Crucifixion, which features a literal cast of thousands and is centered around a young girl, would have been incredibly disturbing in a lesser director's hands, but in this film it comes across with such an eerie reality that it's hard to recall the scene as anything but dream-like.
Finally, note the film's insistence, on all levels, upon the tyranny of repetition: travel outward (i.e. out of the city) is impossible, but a cab driver exhausts himself driving back and forth through the city; the dead refuse to stay buried; a poem by Cortazar reappears throughout the film; and humans, seemingly, are doomed to play out the same ancient rituals time and time again. Andersson seems to suggest, in scene after scene, that claustrophobia and agoraphobia, generally considered opposites, are essentially based on the same emotion: a visceral fear, shared by all humanity, of being utterly alone."
14,Songs from the Second Floor,9,6 November 2003,Postmodern society uncovered,"""Songs from the Second Floor"" is the ultimate film about the postmodern society. It shows uniform people, caught in the treadmill. Everyone gets stuck: in traffic jams, in drawers or in their beds, all symbolizing the inability to do something about their situation. We are all in the hands of the institutions and the global market powers. This is a world where the old generation sacrifice their young and where you cannot invite everyone to your birthday party (because then each guest would only get a small crumb, and that wouldn't be fun, would it?). The main character turns to the institutions for answers, but the church cannot help him, nor can the university or the clueless government. The only sane person in this movie has been put in a mental institution, because of his ability to write poems and to sit down, not participating in creating the constant traffic jams in the city without name (the city representing the postmodern world).
The film also has a religious theme. It pictures Jesus as a man without any gift for business, a loser who was crucified because of his kindness. Jesus didn't profit on other people, and therefore he has no place in postmodern culture. We have cast away all that is good so that our meaningless lives in the treadmill won't be challenged.This film is really about sitting down, about rethinking your way of life before it's too late. It urges you to discover values other than making profits or being the soulless slave of the postmodern society. I think it's a masterpiece!And I almost forgot: the film's got excellent acting and photo as well. This is the best Swedish movie since... Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" I guess."
15,Songs from the Second Floor,10,31 January 2003,Perfect.,"This movie is stunningly beautiful. It seems like each scene has been thought over for decades to make it perfect. The movie itself contains a series of smaller scenes all resembling something, what it resembles you have to find out for yourself, much like Kafka's poems. The movie switches from realism to surrealism and is as I see it a reaction to the unpersonal modern day society. It is easily the best movie I have ever seen, and the movie that touched me the most too. Suits Europeans more then Americans in my opinion since Europeans have a more serious view on movies then Americans and because Europeans tend to be a bit brighter then Americans."
16,Songs from the Second Floor,,2 August 2008,"A post-millennium satire on human displacement, as brought to us by IKEA","Building on the director's two preceding short films - Something Has Happened (1987) and World of Glory (1991) - the presentation of Songs from the Second Floor (2000) draws heavily on a satirical juxtaposition between content and form that is disarming to say the least. Again, it ties in with director Roy Andersson's background in commercial advertising, with any familiarity with even a handful of his celebrated short-form marketing videos establishing his trademark style of deliberately flat, static compositions filled with an impeccably rich attention to mise-en-scene, bracketed by an engaging reliance on surrealist farce and gruelling deadpan. Throughout his career - stretching as far back as even his second feature film, the critically mauled Galip (1975) - Andersson has mined a path of social satire that draws on human fragility and an almost absurd comedy of errors motif that seems to grow from routine, everyday-like misadventures, into full-blown tragedies. At its most simplistic, his work could be interpreted as a series of sketches that attempt to parody the seeming futility of everyday life in such a way as to find humour and hope in even the most despairing of situations.Andersson's aesthetic then is to document the harsh-realities of the world in the most stylised of forms; capturing despair, loneliness and alienation with the designer gloss of an IKEA commercial. The sense that companies want us to aspire to middle-aged suicide, alcoholism and desperation is incredibly daring in design, especially when captured by Andersson's elaborate mise-en-scene. This interpretation is the most obvious strand of Songs of the Second Floor, and yet it is also the most problematic. With this particular artistic approach in mind, one could always accuse Andersson of hypocrisy, or even of ""biting the hand that feeds him""; as the money he makes from his day-job directing TV commercials is pumped into these stark satires on consumerist despair and modern alienation. However, is this really what Andersson was intending? The design of the film all looks real enough, with the director and his crew going to great lengths to design these locations (including the exteriors) on the soundstages at Andersson's Studio 24; and yet, there's an odd, off-kilter exaggeration that is apparent almost immediately. The largely monochromatic colour palette, the drab production design and the actors made up in a lifeless, grey skin tone that recalls the ugliness of Something Has Happened, all suggest a more unreal presentation of reality deliberately overstated; but for what purpose? Is the film merely a Godardian satire on the nature of consumerism and a comment on how the wheels of everyday existence conspire to grind us into place? Or is there something deeper perhaps?We know the world is a facade - or a work of high-concept design - but it feels real enough; with those endless lines of congested traffic, drunken businessmen, foreign dignitaries and surreal manifestations recalling the kind of absurd (yet mundane) sights that we see every day of our lives! Andersson's use of composition is always magnificent, and the parallels drawn between European political history and modern day consumerism are as intelligent as they are humorous; with many different interpretations covering everything from a microcosm of 20th century existence in the face of the new millennium, to a more imaginative reading, in which the characters exist in a purgatory-like netherworld. Regardless of such interpretations, which are ultimately there for the individual to discover, the film works as a result of the keen humour - which is dark and reminiscent of the work of Aki Kaurismäki, in particular films like Hamlet Goes Business (1987) and The Man Without a Past (2002) - and of course, Andersson's uniquely defiant and immediately iconic style.With most films, the idea of a static camera represents a fear on the part of the filmmaker; especially in Hollywood, where an immobile camera has come to signify a lack of movement within the story. Not so here. Andersson's genius is to build a self-contained visual tableau in which the world of the story can spill out from within the frame, in a way that creates stories within stories. The action central to the film is kept in the foreground, while the more interesting elements are featured in the background. The director suggests this by the use of the locked-off camera and through his use of windows and mirror imagery; eventually making these entry points our focus of attention, while still allowing the various characters (that are never formally introduced) to jostle for our attention. The episodic nature can be a strain at first, but keep with it, as the film does reward. Admittedly, you can still approach the film as nothing more than a series of inter-connected vignettes that the director uses to hang his message on - with the characters drifting in and out of this constantly disintegrating facade of a city, as the absurd, nightmarish imagery begins to add up - but either way, this is a film that needs to be experienced."
17,Songs from the Second Floor,10,13 June 2002,Mix up Franz Kafka with Swedish folklore and put it into a slide projector.,"This is definitely the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life.Mix up Franz Kafka with Swedish folklore and put it into a slide projector. Then add rich variety and outrageous characters + Benny Andersson's (former ABBA) beautiful musical compositions - and you got it...I would normally consider it impossible to make a film work out this way: The camera is not moving an inch in 49 of the 50 shots, and the characters are only saying very few words, moving around very slow and very little. It's almost like a slide-show, but it works out terrific, no - it works out fantastic!!!"
18,Songs from the Second Floor,10,7 August 2001,"Forceful, nightmarish & brilliant surreal cinema","'Beloved be the one who sits down.' - Cesar VallejoThis is an outstanding, surreal, nightmarish, apathetic, absurd, indelible, and at times, darkly amusing picture from Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson. The film offers us a selection of chaotic, compelling and haunting still sequence shots (the camera doesn't move once throughout the entire film), each of them wonderfully presented in dull, lifeless colours and framed in stylish composition. Most of the people in the film seem to be disenchanted nomads, lost in a futile world. Their faces are very pale, as though they have been white-powdered to death. The film is affecting because it is stationary, yet it's conveying so much forceful emotion. It wants to move but it can't. It's stuck in a state of perpetual inertia, just like the constant gridlock of traffic that is strangling the city.
The film opens with a man talking to a man under a sun bed (we can only see his feet), who tells him, ""Everything has its day. What's the point of staying where there's only misery? When that day comes I'll be long gone... and so should you!"". Shortly after this we see the man who was in the opening scene firing one of his staff of thirty years service. The man hangs around his leg, pleading with him, and is dragged along while the boss tries to walk away (he's in a hurry has he's got a game of golf to play). The next sequence shows a man stabbed and beaten by a group of men in an unprovoked attack, whilst a line of people stood at a bus stop look on regardless. The next scene offers some dark humour. A magician attempts to cut a volunteer in half but it all goes terribly wrong. We then briefly see the the poor chap in hospital and later at home with his wife, groaning in agony.The central figure of the film, though, is Kalle, the portly owner of a furniture shop. He sets his shop on fire to get the insurance money. The first time we see Kalle is on a tube train. The sequence is in slow motion and the other passengers on the train open their mouths in unison to classical music. Kalle is distraught and disillusioned with his world. ""It's hard being human"", he moans. One of his sons has, in Kalle's words, ""Wrote poetry till he went nuts"". His son now resides in a mental hospital. Kalle's other son is a taxi driver whose wife has left him. One scene has Kalle being questioned by two insurance investigators while a group of flagellants walk past his furniture shop in the road outside. Kalle is tormented by dead people following him, including his associate Sven who committed suicide, and a Russian boy hanged by the Nazis. Other memorable scenes include one at an airport where a line of overloaded trolleys, piled high with towers of luggage, are all being attemptedly pushed by people (with great difficulty). A former general on his 100th birthday gives a Nazi salute to some military personnel who are visiting him in a rest home. A man tries to set up a business selling crucifixes but finds the business venture fails - ""He's just a crucified loser"", the man says. A young girl is blindfolded and pushed over a cliff in an act of sacrifice by a religious sect. A man's hand gets trapped in a train door. A man vomits on a bar while an inebriated woman clasps a stool, unable to find her feet. The film reminded me of Buñuel's The Phantom of Liberty. It's a magnificent film that will linger in the mind of the spectator for quite some time. Unique surreal cinema."
19,Songs from the Second Floor,10,21 September 2011,Defines the term masterpiece,"I have seen a lot of movies, but recently not many have completely blown me away. Songs from the Second Floor did. The film does look accomplished, the scenery is stunning and the cinematography is done with deliberate disquietingly static insistence. The pace is meditative, again deliberately done to perhaps give the characters more humanity, but it is never dull. The story is told with a haunting and somewhat surrealistic atmosphere with some biting satirical elements, and even more impressive is its ability to effectively convey modern life's coldness and chaos. Songs from the Second Floor is directed beautifully and while completely improvised there is not an amateurish note in sight. In conclusion, an astounding film really. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
20,Songs from the Second Floor,9,24 November 2010,"Utterly unique, funny, and challenging","Unique, funny, brave look at the capitalist bureaucracy slowly destroying Swedish society, told through a series of beautifully photographed absurd and surreal vignettes. (Organized religion takes some lumps as well).The camera never moves, and each scene is a story told in a single wondrously composed and art-directed shot. Some pieces are more powerful than others, some funny, some tragic. But this is bold, adventurous filmmaking. Even it's failed moments are more interesting than most modern 'successes'. It's fascinating to see how much Andersson's style changed since his great first success 'A Swedish Love Story' 30 years earlier. That film was a subtle, naturalistic, wonderful look at young love. Here he creates what one critic aptly labeled 'Monty Python meets Ingmar Bergman'. I'd throw in ex-Monty Python Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' as well. If that sounds at all interesting to you, check this out, as well as Andersson's equally terrific follow up, 'We, The Living'.(Note, the pace is very slow by modern cinema standards. but I found myself pulled into it, the way one is by good poetry)."
21,Songs from the Second Floor,9,27 December 2006,Masterpiece,"I have seen this movie for more then 10 times, but still not the amount of time the director redid the movie, or at least parts of it, to make it such a masterpiece! It's true that this movie will always be in my mind and it inspires me and gives me so much inspiration while working on my own movie. amazingYEs this is a must see, and when you see it, you will for sure always remember itThere are not much movie out there like this, and if you know them please tell mehave fun watching !!"
22,Songs from the Second Floor,8,24 October 2004,"""Beloved are those who sit down""","This is the credo of Swedish film Sånger från andra våningen (Songs From the Second Floor). The film is comprised of a minimum of physical action. Each scene is more like a still photograph in which characters talk about the action that has occurred off screen. Sounds like the premise of a deadly boring film, but the story layers itself amid each scene, details are echoed by different characters, and soon the director's intent becomes apparent: ""A film poem inspired by the poet Caesar Vallejo. A story about our need for love, our confusion, greatness and smallness and, most of all, our vulnerability. It is a story with many characters, among them a father and his mistress, his youngest son and his girlfriend. It is a film about big lies, abandonment and the eternal longing for companionship and confirmation.""The film is highly visually striking. Many of the characters are physical caricatures. Some have come back from the dead. In one scene a businessman who has burned down his furniture shop visits his son in a sanitarium. The son ""wrote poetry until he went nuts,"" the businessman laments. His other son, a mild mannered taxi driver, kneels by the crazy son and says, ""Beloved are those who sit down."" To which the businessman begins ranting and is carted off by two sanitarium attendants.There is also an unexplained all day traffic jam crippling the unnamed city. There are demonstrators moving about in a strange dance protesting the lack of employment in the country.This is a quirky understated film. I love the idea that it's intended a ""film poem"" and was inspired by a poet. It takes on that subtle sensibility, and is surely entirely off-putting to anyone seeking something more verbose."
23,Songs from the Second Floor,8,23 August 2004,Very different,"'Songs from the Second Floor' is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen. It is also very fascinating and most of the times I liked it, but I didn't really care. I liked the single scenes, every one only existing out of one take, and therefore it kept my attention.The movie plays in some kind of apocalyptic world where people are whipping themselves and have conversations with the dead. Of course all these things have symbolic meanings, most of them pretty understandable, but like I said, I didn't really care. Still, every little episode here can be enjoyed. In every shot but one the camera is just standing there and catches a nice image while something is happening in that image. Only one take has a moving camera, when the leading man is talking to a dead friend.Saying more about 'Songs' would be pretty pointless, since I would only explain that it is pretty weird. You will like it or not, but it all depends on taste. At least it is something very different from every other thing you have ever seen and that alone makes it worth watching. Even if you do not like the movie as a whole, you must be able to appreciate the single scenes."
24,Songs from the Second Floor,,21 April 2003,Once in a while there´s a film that lets you think for yourself,"Once in a while there´s a film that lets you think for yourself and find your own story, ""Sånger från andra våningen"" is such a movie. I don´t think there is an explanation to what the story is about and I will not try to explain it, since everyone probably will have their own idea about what´s going on. The film has some of the most beautifull Photography I´ve seen in a long time, a breath of fresh air compared to the ""Glamorous and Flashy"" style of Hollywood. Also the characters are some of the most facinating I´ve seen in a long time. A beautiful piece of cinema that moves in a landscape between Andrei Tarkovsky and David Lynch. If you are sick of having everything spelled out for you, and being treated like an imbecile by Hollywood, you should check out this one. I haven´t had such a good time watching a movie in a long time."
25,Songs from the Second Floor,,9 April 2003,Fantastic film-difficult to categorize,"I saw this film in a theater in San Francisco.  While this film showcases 'the misery of the human existence' as the initial review states, it is very, very funny.  Hard to categorize, but I would use these words to describe it: Sardonic, absurd, blasphemous, and extremely surreal.  It might just as likely appeared as a screenplay by Alfred Jarry.  The characters are SO very pathetic, that all you can do is laugh at them and their awful, boring, dull, dim witted, superstitious existences.  Not to be missed."
26,Songs from the Second Floor,,19 January 2003,A different experience,"This film was shot a couple of years ago and I am still wondering where's the DVD transfer... What I like about cinema or literature is to find things I would never have thought or dreamt of. This film is certainly one of them: every single one of the vignettes that compose it is utterly unforgettable. If you really are willing to open your self and experience a film, this one will surely bring you to tears, asking how can anyone's imagination and writing and filming abilities bring this sort of thing to reality.I can't wait to put my hands on the DVD version: this film deserves a pristine, special edition transfer. You can be sure you won't be disapointed to see this film. If you are, I would really feel sorry for you."
27,Songs from the Second Floor,10,12 November 2000,Symbolic masterpiece,"This is a masterpiece, with no doubt the best swedish film since Ingmar Bergman's ""Fanny and Alexander"" in 1984, probably one of the best ever. What could compete with it? Bergman's best films and maybe some of Bo Widerberg's, but it's hard too compare.It's extremely symbolic. I haven't seen such a symbolic film before. Every scene is filled with details that forms a great and definitely personal way of expression. Roy Andersson has his own way to make films.
Though it takes a stand for the week in society, I can't say I experienced the film as being political. It more criticizes our hole civilization. It's too ""odd"" too win an Oscar, but more than any other film I've seen it truly deserves one."
28,Songs from the Second Floor,8,6 November 2000,Pure Poetry,"I don´t think you can have a ""neutral"" opinion about this movie. Either you hate it or, like me, love it. It´s like nothing else I´ve ever seen. Bizarre scenes in a futuristic, depressing environment, but not without warmth. Where are we heading? What takes to survive as a human being? I think everyone should think of which values that are rewarded in todays society.This movie has been compared with a ""poetry-evening"", and to that I can only agree. One scene may appear strange (they are) but when you´ve seen the movie as a whole, you´re grateful to have shared this Roy Andersson creation."
29,Songs from the Second Floor,10,13 February 2001,"It was melancholy, I had fun.","I saw a trailer and recognized immediately the Kafka elements. But there is more to it than Kafka. There is more beauty here, and perhaps it is more optimistic than kafka. What amazes me when I read other comments is that very few people seem to have noticed how funny the movie is. It is poetic, yes, and tragic at times. The mood is melancholy, and the atmosphere is strange, mostly. Along with all this the movie is funny. It may be that the comedy feeds on tragedy, but it is funny nonetheless. And I was certainly not the only one laughing. ""Give my regards to Goring!"" (A friend told me that Kafka laughed quietly, and sometimes out loud, when writing his stories.) Well, time's up."
30,Songs from the Second Floor,10,6 October 2007,About being human and having a business plan,"This is an on-the-mark masterpiece that keeps getting better every time I see it. It's about the very essence of being human, about guilt and betrayal, about invoking higher powers and making ends meet. How to get bread and butter for the dinner table. Some of the scenes are just madly humorous, others really heavily sad. There are some rather disgusting scenes as well, but together with Benny Andersson's sharply fine-tuned music, this film becomes a masterly experience. Purchase it, append a digit to the retail price, and resell it to your best friend! Songs is more coherent and less dreamlike than ""You the Living"". My grading: 9.67"
31,Songs from the Second Floor,10,4 June 2006,Fantastic visionary parable,"Brilliant film that is as funny as it is moving usually in the same frame. One of the great advertisement makers has used all his skill to make the funniest most beautiful and astonishing attack on all that advertising holds dear. He asks the question, Why is it not enough to be a good man amongst men? Inspiring stuff and worth a couple of visits. After all the shitty blockbusters coming out of this part of the world it is great to see a film maker and a country still pushing the boundaries with impassioned, brilliant and humane movie-making. makes me want to give up making crappy television.Danny Mulheron"
32,Songs from the Second Floor,10,23 March 2003,film is not always entertainment,"Many have commented already on this provocative and substantial movie.  I would add only that this is the kind of movie one can watch alone, watch with a partner (but probably not a date), watch with a group, and then discuss.  It deserves discussion and attention.  It is entertaining but is not entertainment.  It aspires to something else.  It asks what you will do in the face of misery, whether yours or that of a loved one.  This is the best absurdist tragi-comedy I have seen in a very long time.  It bears more than a few guffaws that grow louder with each viewing, but among all the big questions it asks regarding the deal each of us makes with society, the most uncomfortable question it asks is about how we are prepared to treat the people closest to us so as to resolve our own problems."
33,Songs from the Second Floor,,24 June 2002,Strangely Moving in its Bleak Vision,"Through a series of powerful, enigmatic images, Roy Andersson in Songs From the Second Floor develops a vision of present-day urban life that is both shocking and oddly familiar. These images, which include a man covered head-to-toe in ash after his business has burned down, an endless stream of bumper-to-bumper traffic heading nowhere, a poet who ends up in a mental hospital, people flagellating themselves in a street procession, and a trash heap of crucifix symbols, create a narrative of mood rather than plot.
Songs From the Second Floor contains 46 dark yet often amusing and sometimes beautiful vignettes. The camera is static throughout and barely moves, presenting a futuristic world that looks empty and feels soulless, yet is strangely moving in its bleak vision.This mood, aided wonderfully by a soundtrack composed by Benny Andersson of the band ABBA, might be described as desolate. Yet, thankfully, Anderson never allows things to become too heavy. He shows a great feel for dark humor, reminiscent of writers such as Beckett or Kafka. The final result is a great achievement--a movie that forces us to look directly at the inhumanity of modern life, while remembering the good also: that people persevere, are capable of kindness toward each other, and that there is humor in even the darkest of events.Unnerving, yet strangely reassuring, Songs From the Second Floor is one of the most original films I've seen in a long time and one of the most challenging."
34,Songs from the Second Floor,,29 August 2001,DVD Review: Songs from the second floor,"DVD Review: Songs from the second floorA man, a typical ""office-slave"" gets fired from his job. None of his co-workers care and hide behind the doors.An old magician fails to do the ""saw the man in half""-trick and saws an innocent man in the stomache.An old gay couple is living a boring life. One of them is worried about that he fired a man from his job and the other one studies the amazing trafficjam outside the window.Karl has finally burned down his furniture store and hopes that the insurance company will believe it was an accident.Karl is the main character in the movie, but we´ll see all these different kind of people everywhere, just worrying about their lives and what´s happning to the city. Why is there trafficjams everywhere and why is the world going completely mad? It´s hard to describe the story in Roy Andersson's ""Songs from the second floor"", it´s more of a series of paintings, carefully planned and executed on the screen. Roy did this expensive movie without a scrip, relied on amateur actors and with a very downplayed dialouge. Most of the leading actors where found on the streets or in a store, either by Roy or someone else in his team, and using them was probably one of the best things he did with this movie.
Roy Andersson have been Swedens leading TV commerical director since 1968 and have recieved numerous awards for his very special and very personal TV commercials. Most of them are filmed like this movie: just one take, amatour actors and minimal dialouge. In 1970 he did ""A swedish love story"" and got a big hit on his hands. That resulted in more jobs with TV commercials and it wasn´t until 1975 he did his next film, the massive flop (but now considered a masterpiece) ""Giliap"". He went bankrupted and continuted succesfully with commericals. So it wasn´t until the year 2000 he did his third, and hopefully not his last film, the mighty doomday vision ""Songs from the second floor"". Even more inspired from his excellent short movies World of glory (a must-see... it´s impossible to describe) and ""Something have happened"" about the AIDS plauge and the roots of it, he has finally created the ultimate Roy Andersson-movie.The film consists of 46 different scenes and set-pieces. Each of them are filmed in one take and with no camera movements (except for one scene, a slow tracking shot on a trainstation). The actors are mostly ""ugly"" (normal looking and not ""movie stars""), painted very pale and bleak. There´s hardly any dialouge, and everything happens to the newly written, lowkey, music by ABBA´s Benny Andersson.It´s a satire of the deconstruction of social welfares, the society and the people with the power. Ok, it´s a very Swedish movie. Depressing for some people. Extremely funny for others and just to arty for most of the crowd. To me it´s a very funny movie, black comedy at its best, but I believe most people will not describe it that way. But it´s still a powerful drama about lonely people and ghosts from the past. It´s a shame though to talk about it in Sweden, since our nation's way to act during WW2, which is still quite embarresing, but Roy have for the first time brought this up in a Swedish movie for the first time and have made one very funny scene, but still tragic and to some people very controversial. The scene shows a high military man, celebrating his 100th birthday and is totally way up in the blue, at the same time as his colleagues is gonna make a speach about his greatness. When they play a fanfare the old general´s hand is moving up in a nazi-salute and he says with a weak voice ""Say hello to Goering...""The film turns more weird and weird, and in the end the apocalyptic theme is very close. With the sacrifice of a pure child, dead rises from the earth and ghosts are haunting Karl. It never becomes a horror- or fantasytale, just a story about a man and his problems with the society around him. It´s heavy on symbolism, both a good and bad thing. Bad? Mostly because it´s almost to literal and that the film lacks of speed in the middle.
Technical it´s a triumph both for the Swedish filmindustry and for the art of film itself. This wasn´t a cheap film and Roy financed the film mostly himself, mostly without the help of the bad and very poor Swedish filmindustry. The sets built for this movie is HUGE...all, but one take, it´s carefully built sets that´s a must see, specially the airport that never ends, and the trainstation.The Swedish DVD is excellent and filled with deleted and alternate scenes, a great one hour long documentary, test-clips of three scenes (just faboulus material), audio commentary and some b-reel footage. The picture and sound is sharp and clear, and for those who cares, it´s also in anamorphic widescreen. The bad thing about the extras are this: you can´t remove the audio commentary during the deleted scenes. It´s sad, because in one of them (""the lobster party"") there´s dialouge which is impossible to hear now. The cover of the DVD also states that a trailer is included, although there's no trailer on it. Not good. It´s also a bad thing that this edition isn´t avaible with english subtitles.I hope all you guys and girls out there are gonna have a chance to see this strange movie, even if some of you might find it lousy and boring but the rest the total opposite! :)/Fred Anderson(And a big thank to my close friend Rob who helped me correct some of the english spelling)"
35,Songs from the Second Floor,10,21 February 2006,Never seen anything like it,"One of the rare contemporary films that is fully deserving of the full ten out of ten! This is... is... I simply cannot describe it. Nobody makes films like this, and I wish more people would at least try to. On first viewing, I found myself having to adapt to a pace I am not used to in recent television-generation film-making; slow prolonged takes, all wide master shots (a single camera movement!), bizarre religious and political allegories reminiscent of Bergman and Tarkovsky... I've never compared a filmmaker with either of them, but I have to say those are who I was thinking of while I was watching this. The film is almost so surreal and contains so much dark comedy that I can't say that it is as touching or 'human' as either of their greatest films, but Andersson has crafted such a unique style that it's incomparable - and this statement sounds like a stretch but I am being completely sincere - with anything ever made. This will go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made. That is if history remembers him! This is the only one of his films widely available in the states, and I haven't met anyone who has seen it or has heard of him, I always seem to be the person introducing it to others. I think anyone with a remote interest in film or life itself would find this endlessly fascinating. He is so obscure and has made so few films, (plus he notoriously takes his sweet time to even get one off the ground), that it's not clear how many films he has left in him before he throws the towel in, seeing as the guys well over half a century old.... I'm not even going to bother with a synopsis here, I just finished watching it for the fortieth time, and I felt a compelling urge to praise it here!! Watch this now."
36,Songs from the Second Floor,10,20 September 2000,"It's not a film, it's a masterpiece","Not easy to comment this crazy project (started in 1996 and awarded in Cannes 2000), a series of 46 still shots dealing with humiliation, absurdity, original guilt. It doesn't look like anything, but to use a short way, we could say it's like Fellini & Jacques Tati taking the subway together, reading Kafka after a Tex Avery retrospective. Comedy and tragedy are struggling in moving paintings, while the main character gradually becomes conscious of the absurdity of the world and realizes just how difficult is to be a human being."
37,Songs from the Second Floor,3,25 March 2003,Twaddle,"I'm broad minded about movies and drama, honest.  I believe my taste to be eclectic.  But this movie is sheer pretentious twaddle.  It had nothing whatever to commend it.  We couldn't stick it.  Thank goodness we had waited for the video as that enabled us to fast forward once we couldn't stand it any more.  Forget it."
38,Songs from the Second Floor,1,14 December 2007,Probably the worst piece of crap i have ever seen,"I saw this movie at a theater in Stockholm, and i am really sorry, but when 1/3 of the audience starts booing and leaving the place in the middle of the movie, it wont go to the history as a fantastic film. The reason I saw it was off course the GREAT criticism it received by all the Swedish critics, the creme de la creme of movie lovers, as they say.I, painfully, saw the whole movie, but since about 2 minutes into the movie I wanted to leave and so did almost everybody in the theater. I've talked to so called ""smart"" people about this movie, and they say that it has a deep meaning, about the everyday stress that drives people crazy, but all I really think is that this movie is totally crap. Do not see this movie. You will feel bad afterward. Roy Anderson makes fantastic commercial movies though =)"
39,Songs from the Second Floor,3,22 February 2005,there is no light and they all suffer from depression,"there is no greater meaning to all this, henke. this movie is plain simple. there is no sunlight and the faces of people are white - as already being dead, yet they can obviously be chased by guilt of the dead (zombies?). i am stunned the critics gave this movie high rates. i don't believe in making ""art movies"" to torture audience. there is some capitalism and Christianity criticism (not amusing at all and also without any strong point) in it as we can all see. on the basic level, that is. there is some gender inequality expression. there are some self-damage scenes. also not fun at all. not even shocking or empathy provoking. they just are. just exist.its interesting, because at first you expect this dark comedy (?) will develop into something. then it just doesn't evolve into anything and there is less and less humour. i took a nap, woke up, the movie was still the same.i actually don't regret taking a nap during the movie and feel no shame for doing so.this movie makes you feel ""big nothing"" at the end. erase everything and live without sunlight. wanna feel like that? then run and see it."
40,Songs from the Second Floor,10,30 October 2004,"A masterwork, no doubt","I got into this movie because I know I seem to like small and weirdlittle movies. Don't know what I was expecting of this film, but thisblew me away totally! I've seen my share of Ingmar Bergman, and I even though I loveBergman's movies I've found them tough to get through sometimes(though they're absolutely worth it, most of them).This movie was nothing like that though. Just a pure delight fromstart to finish. Such a beautiful movie.You see static scenes, from a non-moving camera.. which all ofthem seems to have been timed and calculated to the extremeeven though you don't notice it on the actors at all..All the scenes are all taken in one shot, which also is stunninglydone. The thing that makes it so easy to watch though is that it relies onhumor, even though they're quite dramatic settings. The dialogue is sharp as needles and the whole movie works likea puzzle.. because some way or the other things here seems toconnect to each other. Like, there's this huge traffic jam in the city which has lasted for 8hours and nobody knows whats holding it up. Something tells uslater that its symbolic probably. The scenes at the madness institute is really funny. Where thisone guys talks about how Jesus was hanged on a cross, becausehe was a nice person. Everything in this movie seems so plannedto the detail that its simply a gasping experience all up to the lastscene which might be the most fantastic of them all. The best of it is that it doesn't really give away anything, and itshumor and depth is so well hidden. Its an amazing movie only.I don't think I have any complaints at all. Expected it to be some kind of weird little thing with some goodmoments, but I ended up with one of the best movie I've seen outof Scandinavia this far. I wish Norway could get their head of their ass and do somethinglike this. 10/10."
41,Songs from the Second Floor,10,15 September 2000,The BEST!!!!!!!!!!!,"As a film critic, I've spent my hours in dark rooms, watching it all.... Roy Anderssons epic about The State We're In is way beyond description, it's the funniest, saddest, truest, most beautiful and most Touching fling You'll ever see!!!! I promise........El Guttorm"
42,Songs from the Second Floor,1,2 March 2002,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"I try to keep an open mind when I go to the movies, and I saw this on the word of a friend.  I'll never trust his word again.  This was 90 minutes of sheer boredom.  People are saying it's a classic, and that Monty Python had better ""watch out"".  Monty Python has nothing to worry about. 
Sure, a few scene's gave me some mild laughs, but this was nothing more than a pretentious art film.  I'm sure people will just say I don't ""get"" the movie, and that's fine.  Frankly, I don't WANT to get the movie, one viewing was enough.  I like independent films as much as the next, but after the movie ended, I wanted to watch an Arnie flick and forget all about this experience."
43,Songs from the Second Floor,4,14 August 2004,Not my cup of tea,"Songs From The Second Floor is so desperate in trying to be smart, original and unique, it forgets that cinema actually has to try to tell a story the best way possible.Several stories intervine at what seems to be the apocalypse, with insurance fraud, heavy traffic, talking to the dead, hate and fear for strangers and a magician's act gone wrong all play some part.All nice and good, and some scenes are interesting and funny, but what are the writers saying? It's too much of a 'different look on humanity - think about it!' kinda movie. Too little guidelines if you'd ask me.At other times the movie is downright boring and if it weren't for the perfect ending the movie would be a waste of time. Now it's... well not that, although there are tons of better ways to spend your hour and a half...4/10."
44,Songs from the Second Floor,10,30 March 2007,"Twisted reality, twisted reality show","I watched this movie the first time and I found it intriguing but kind of hard to stay with. When I saw it the second time two years later I laughed myself sick. The third time around, one more year gone by, I could hardly wait to see it again. To know this film was a masterpiece was not difficult, already the first time. To feel it, though, required the second time. It just physically works that way. The camera takes in so much with each shot, you can't keep up with it. And it's not simply that there are too many details in each and every composition. More than that, it's the difficulty of taking them all in digestion-wise. All the small pieces of information you may gather from watching add to an extremely dark view of the world. 'Mister Andersson' planned it all very carefully. It's like he was really-really fed up with everything in the matrix, you know, and decided to let his anger go by preparing for years for every single destructive shot included in the 'movie' (movie is not a really appropriate word, since it's rather static in fact), so that he could reveal the most about the ugliness he saw around himself. He invites you to a corner at some party you may not have enjoyed anyway, to a corner from which you can see all those present at the same time, and then he shows you how all those people around kill, maim and torture each other. And, to get you even more desperate, he also points out the strings attached to them: they are all puppets on strings, you see, they are doing what they are doing because their characters and their whole lives are structured in a given way stemming from reasons beyond anyone individually. Then he finally gives you some consolation by somehow putting what you see into an angle from which you can't help but laugh, not really cruelly, because it's about your own fate, too. It's just the emergency exit for the mind, for which the safest way out is delving into something totally different after watching this twisted reality show."
45,Songs from the Second Floor,10,24 February 2006,Pure cinematic art,"All I expected when I went to see this film in the first place was the same kind of twisted, tragic humor than in the Arla commercials shown in Scandinavia about the time of the film's release.It was all there - and so much more. This film is quite unlike anything I have seen before or since. The camera moves once. There really aren't that many lines, not to mention action. And somehow the film still manages to be an unforgettable experience. It makes you feel, it makes you see all the wonderful nuances in the smallest situations. It makes you realize the tragicomic nature of life in ways rarely seen even in the most appreciated works of art. I think it has a real message that is very, very true to life. It can't be explained - it must be seen. You'll love it!"
46,Songs from the Second Floor,10,27 January 2006,Something incredible...,"Something about this film sticks with you long after the final scene. It's haunting and beautiful, surreal and touching, and altogether brilliant. There are scenes of wonderful humor, while others are mournful and reflective.""Songs"" is a look at the lives of different people, their lives disrupted by something beyond their control.You can interpret ""Songs"" however you want; I personally view it as a reflection on how Y2K reduced our lives to chaos, and how we let those frenzied moments govern our lives.Whatever you take away from this film, you know instantly that you've seen something new and fresh."
47,Songs from the Second Floor,,11 December 2004,"I'm so tired, I feel drained","The doorbell woke me this morning. It was a Jehovah's Witness that I've talked to a couple of times before, and didn't mind talking to again. We ended up talking for at least an hour. We talked about finding the way. I'm a secular anarchist, and he's a Jehovah's Witness, and we both came across looking a little lost. Me for my defying of authority, him for his adherence to it.Something tells me that he wants me to give him a better way than the way he's on-and I plan to, as soon as I can find one.After his departure, I browsed the Watchtower and Awake he left for me. It made me sad.I crawled back into my bed and watched Songs from the Second Floor on my notebook computer, in the dark. I like watching movies like that, it's almost like reading. It's much closer than a TV.One and a half hour later (the movie's duration) I'm so tired, I just want to be held. Loneliness and desperation. Seeing the movie felt just like our conversation-just angst, no answer.Is it a good movie? Yeah. I liked the performances given by most of the troupe (except, perhaps, the main character who was a bit grating). Although, I refrained from voting on this one. It so depends on what you want from a movie and what mood you're in.For me it was ""a real downer""-a movie that could turn a good mood into sad, and making my morning conversation look futile.If you think the myth of Sisyphus would make a great movie, this is a film for you."
48,Songs from the Second Floor,10,3 September 2004,this is a remarkable film,"some spoilers...this is a remarkable film. i can't honestly think of where to start...i suppose the first thing that struck me was the visual style of the film. interiors (with the exception of home spaces) are colorful and clean, exteriors are generally dirty and cluttered. interiors are also shot entirely on an angle. the sets are constructed in such a way, or the camera is placed in such a way, that we almost always face a corner. if you're watching a play then the back wall is parallel to your viewing angle, but in this film the room is rotated about 90 degrees so that the bottom of the back wall runs diagonally - rather than horizontally - through the middle of the screen. this choice allows for an amazing amount of depth within each composition. depth of field isn't emphasized very much with the use of a wide angle lens, but this doesn't detract at all from the depth that these interior compositions has. this element alone makes the film interesting to watch, but this is really just the tip of the iceberg. every shot is thoughtfully composed, and needs to be because the camera doesn't move at all. remarkably, i didn't even notice this obvious fact until about 30-40 minutes into the film. i think this is a result of the great energy that each composition has; or maybe i'm just trying to save face. to take a step back, the film is a comedic surrealist drama. that description coupled with the fact that it's a Swedish picture would likely scare off most viewers. i'm not generally a fan of surrealist film, but this one isn't over the top, or completely nebulous. sure, there is little sense that is made over the entire course of the film and there are seeming non-sequitors within just about every scene, but somehow it all works - either comedically, dramatically, or artistically. that, i'll admit, is just a matter of opinion so you'll have to see it to decide for yourself...there are certain motifs that are visited throughout the film...love, loss, home life, isolation, de-humanization effect of economics, etc. also, while interiors are generally fairly colorful, people's faces are generally extremely white...and not just because they're Swedish. at some point it is implied, or maybe revealed, that the people we are observing are dead, and this certainly would be supported by their dead looking skin color and the surreal nature of their environment. a great film for those who are willing to give it a try. B++."
49,Songs from the Second Floor,10,4 December 2002,"New category this year: ""Best Movie Ever""","Quite simply the best movie ever made. The Western World celebrated Y2K and the most sinister, beautiful, cynical, provoking film of all time was made... If you only like action movies, forget about it. For all the rest of you who haven't seen Songs yet, I envy you the opportunity to see it for the first time.  Now get up and rent it!"

51,Songs from the Second Floor,10,8 April 2002,This film will make you think,"The artistic direction and cinematography of this film is amazing. Not since Kubrick's ""The Shining"" or Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" or even David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" has a film moved me in such a disturbing way as to make me question not only who I am, but also what it is about contemporary society that would warrant or inspire such a radically thought provoking screenplay in combination with still-shot acting and beautiful scene transition.It is a film to be treasured."
52,Songs from the Second Floor,10,11 June 2008,A Funeral Song For The 20th Century,"Songs From The Second Floor, is the second feature from director Roy Andersson, whose spent his career making according to fellow Swedish director and legend Ingmar Bergman, ""The best commercials in the world""(Youtube his name for proff of this). Anderson takes an advertisers eye to this film and inverts it, into around 40 or 50 short vignettes, some with recurring characters, like the man seen on the cover who has burned down his business to collect the insurance but bumbled the job, while most include walkons, and many characters drift in an out of scenes before the movie ends. These short vignettes are nearly all deadpan and absurdist tragi-comic advertisements for peoples lives broken or on the verge of breaking. The antagonist, if there must be one, is capitalism(a subject which the commercial making Anderson is very much aware), and it's de-humaizing effects on all its touches. As bleak as all this sounds, the material is played more often than not for laughs. There's a traffic jam which has clogged the city as if everyone were leaving at the same time, a girl who is blindfolded and lead of a cliff by her village elders, a man accidentally sawed in half by poor magician, men and women in business suits walk down streets in parade's flailing themselves as an act of penance to God so he will prevent the further falling of stocks, and a man followed around by ghosts of friends and strangers. If that weren't enough each scene is composed with a static non moving camera, giving each vignette the detailed composition of a photograph or a painting. The movie could be considered a tragi-comic funeral song for western capitalism and modernity(the film takes place just before the new millennium I think), but a tag like that really doesn't communicate how humane, clever, funny, and accessible this movie really is. It's like a lyrical Monty Python film, or a an absurdist Ingmar Bergman, and yet again it's a film all it's own, structurally, conceptually, and aesthetically, if your interested in where film-making may be going in the future and right now, Songs From The Second floor, is the movie to see, and one of the best of the new millennium"
53,Songs from the Second Floor,,13 May 2008,"Heres to You, Capitalism","Songs from the Second Floor (2000) ****Tragic. Hilarious. Absurd. Those three words fit Roy Andersson's Songs from the Second Floor to a 't.' The film was a success at the 2000 Cannes film festival, winning the Jury Prize and gaining critical accolades internationally. The film is entirely unique, and magical creation of Andersson's mind. The film follows a number of individuals,some of whom are loosely tied together through personal connections, all of whom share in the existential dread and tragedy of life. We have a magician who nearly saws in half a volunteer, a fired employee, a businessman specializing in crucifixes, and another man who has lost his business to a fire (a fire which he admits he started), his family (including a son who has gone mad from writing poetry), and a series of other characters, not least of which a large congregation of businessmen who walk the streets amid a never ending traffic jam whipping themselves with chains. The story flows through vignettes, all captured in long shots by a camera that only moves once throughout the film. The city appears abandoned - save for the traffic jam and roaming flagellants. It's gray and dingy, as abstract a city as could ever be imagined. The people who inhabit it are drab and deathly pale - that the film opens with a man in a tanning bed becomes utterly hilarious in its irony as the film progresses. There are so many scenes of extraordinary surrealist absurdity that if one was to talk about them all they would need many more pages than available here. Let's consider a few of the most memorable though. In one scene, a woman uses a telephone to explain to someone on the other end that she is stuck in traffic, and cannot get out. She is in a bar; outside we see the line of traffic, moving only as slowly as conceivable without standing still. Everything appears gray, totally abstract as from some world where colours have never been invented. The atmosphere is surreal, and I realize as I describe it I do it no justice at all. Another brilliant scene involves what appears to be the cities entire population as they gather - businessmen and clergymen alike - to carry out the ritual sacrifice of a young girl, meant to stimulate the stagnating economy. Another excellent scene involves the man who has burned down his store, trying to explain to investigators what he's lost, only to be distracted by the passing hoard of businessmen whipping themselves. For me however the most amazing scene comes last. In a very long take, we see the crucifix man discard a truckload of his inventory in front of the arsonist. He leaves, and the arsonist takes out his large crucifix and sets it down. We realize that 4 or so individuals have been slowly walking down the road in the background throughout the scene. They've been following the arsonist earlier in the film asking for help. This time he throws a can at them to scare them off. To his and our surprise,dozens of other people seem to pop up out of nowhere from the ground in the surrounding field. What a shot; it's one of the best I've ever seen, and the camera never moves once throughout its duration. But I digress. What does it all mean? A quick search of movie message boards will lead you to a number of queries; the DVD also apparently has a commentary track by Andersson himself discussing and deconstructing the symbolism in the film (I have not seen this yet, and as of now am still unsure if I really want to). The film, I think, a scathing satire of modern society and capitalist realism. It's also about the dangers of mixing superstition and reality. Consider the flagellating businessmen, self-inflicting pain to stimulate the economy. The sacrifice of the young girl for the same purpose; this also simultaneously highlights how corporations expect us to march towards our deaths each day (ie cigarettes and alcohol, and so on). The man who burns down his business is shown to be greedy throughout, happy he doesn't have to repay a friend when he commits suicide; yelling at his institutionalized son for not understanding that the purpose of life is to buy something and sell it with one or two extra zeroes. Andersson has been called the slapstick Bergman, and surely is one of the most interesting products of Sweden. He had pulled a Malick like move prior to Songs from the Second Floor, not making a feature film for 20 some years (although he was active in directing shorts, docs, and commercials). His return was a glorious one though, and one that was entirely original, and entirely inspiring. This is a dark and tragic film, but one that is also funny in that darkest of dark, and absurdest of absurd ways."
54,Songs from the Second Floor,,2 June 2006,Existential cynicism!,"Wonderful existential cynicism!!! This movie dissects human traits and human patterns of behavior with a lovely dispassionate humor. The filmmaker holds up his mirror and in it we see the business world as a serious and entropy-laden failure, organized religion as artifice--literally the manufacture and selling of different-sized and styled crucifixes --- a failing business of another color, the human collective as very much out of sync with itself and the organic realm--another form of failure, and through everything a touch of sadness.I loved the sanity of this. At least I thought the film sane. It reveals a flawed and inept society of men and women, most of whom have some, if little, insight to their predicament. That life is a series of miscues, that no one can lay claim to being error-free, and that those who are more skilled -""professional""- are merely making mistakes at a more involved level is the humbling message we see repeated in mostly every vignette.The film is shot, as others have remarked, with a still camera, and the actors constitute the movement, usually very constrained and staged. So the film is by no means verite, yet through its dark cynical humor, it reveals the chafed and tender areas that everyone knows yet few will admit and fewer will proffer for public discussion. His actors are caught in a world in which escape is desirable but no one knows how. Or where to begin. They are trapped and much like the characters in Beckett's ""Waiting For Godot"" the irony is in learning to accept the trapped state without questioning too deeply the nature of the trap. Rumination is destructive. Anderson's characters are unable to find peace or contentment in their lot."
55,Songs from the Second Floor,10,9 March 2002,My ex-favourite film,"When I saw this film for the first time I was totally overwhelmed by the perfection of each scene and the fantastic visual beauty. But when I saw it for the second and third time, I started feeling a bit sick. It´s very depressing. Few happy people appear during the film, which is filmed with a static camera in all scenes except one, and nevertheless it´s a definite masterpiece which I can recommend to almost everyone (perhaps not to all Americans).When I saw this film it hit the first place on my film list (now 100 movies long). Now The Fellowship of the Ring is first (a totally different film) and Sånger... is second."
56,Songs from the Second Floor,9,12 February 2001,Monty Python with a Scandinavian touch.,"Painfully slow at times, the film takes time to get used to. Thepicture composition makes it all worth while though as it isextremely well thought out. The hilarious twists are so fascinating and surprising that theaudience experiences a sensation somewhat similar to that ofbeing run over by a flock of ducks.This isn't a film for the broad audience but it is certainly worth theeffort even if one is not into this kind of films normally. Although the language being Swedish it is clearly accessible toeveryone as the actual picture composition is as earlier stated themost important factor in this special, special film."
57,Songs from the Second Floor,9,8 January 2001,Sweden's Entry into the Oscars is Bergmanesque,"Sweden's 2000 entry into the Oscars foreign film category is long, tedious, confusing, symbolic and most of all stunning. It leaves the viewer with a confusion on the state of things and the only unifying thread is the lack of hope over life.  Bergman might have been more confusing than this, but to American eyes this was refreshing and riveting. Long and confusing, intelligent and scary in its depiction of life in the most subtly horrifying way. Worth a watch if your into films with no clear plot or resolution or a connesuier of Bergman or Arthouse."
58,Songs from the Second Floor,10,8 January 2001,Excellent!,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time. Shots set in Öland, Sweden are just beautiful. I couldn´t believe my eyes. The story is just remarkable and the actors are so perfect. Roy Anderssons masterpiece is not to be missed."
59,Songs from the Second Floor,10,17 December 2000,A film poem beyond any imagination,"Roy Anderson is not like any other filmmaker in the world. He has his own style. While many of the new, fresh film directors choose to edit fast (Spike Jonze as an example), Roy Anderson works with long takes, placing the many stories in one Picture. Oh my god so beautiful.Roy Anderson doesn't make any story. During the past he has only made three full-length movies including this one. In the meanwhile he has made many award-winning commercial features.The movie is about many different people who does different things. The next day we'll see how the town reacts to this. Roy Anderson keeps his visual style reminding us of the Gary Larson pictures placing people in odd situations in just one picture. Thats near to what happens here. Sanger från andra våningen. It's probably the best movie of the year 2000 together with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Go see it."
60,Songs from the Second Floor,1,29 August 2004,An unmitigated grotesque,"I had neither the mind, stomach, nor spiritual inclination to witness its conclusion.  This was an unmitigated grotesque.A step beyond Bliss and City of Lost Children, which at least had hopes of arresting one's attention and sympathy, because Songs From the Second Floor barely nods at narrative.  I see these three as sharing a need to affront the viewer without giving nearly enough recompense.  At least medical research subjects are paid for their pain.  These movies form a ""comedy"" club I do not wish to be a member of.Apparently Roy Andersson was influenced by a poet named Caesar Vallejo.  Well, I might read a poem or two like this before putting the book down, maybe even pick it up again later to read a little more, but I am not going to read for 98 minutes without a break.Only the second movie I have ever walked out on in the theater."
61,Songs from the Second Floor,3,28 March 2004,Artsy crap.,"'Nuff said.  I was going to end my review with ""'nuff said"" but IMDb won't allow it, so...here goes.  After a half dozen scenes I kept waiting for this nonsensical junk to end.  Scene after scene of unconnected dreariness. Don't get me wrong...I don't mind dreary flicks with a point.  But this movie just plain sucks.  I even listened to the director speak of the film on one of the DVD special features, and his disorganized dribble did nothing to change my mind.  I rarely disagree with Roger Ebert, but this stupid movie made it happen.I read that it took this guy four years to make this movie.  Its a complete waste of life, if you ask me."
62,Songs from the Second Floor,2,29 August 2006,"One word: repetition, repetition, repetition.","OVERALL: It's not really a 2/10. I'm just being exceptionally brutal because this film had so much potential, but it lost itself in a swamp of modernist absurdism which doesn't have a point. This is yet another film where the director chooses style over substance. The result is two hrs of gimmicky schlock which will intrigue the film school teachers, but those of us who are looking for a fulfilling literary experience (poetry, plot, theme, etc) will be highly disappointed.SCRIPT: There are basically 10 lines of dialogue which are repeated a dozen times each. Count how many times someone says, ""Beloved is the man who sits down."" Literally about 12. Well, that's one Swedish phrase that's been etched into my brain for no good reason. Honestly I haven't heard so much repetition since the last time I sang ""99 bottle of beer on the wall"" round the campfire.VISUALS: The entire film has a very drab, bleached white appearance which makes you want to smack the side of your VCR a few times. Yes, this is just another gimmick which is initially novel, but it gets old after 45 minutes of the same thing. Also, each scene was filmed entirely in one shot. Usually I consider that to be a huge plus (e.g. Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rope"", Bela Tarr's ""Werckmeister Harmoniak""). But in this case it was too obvious and excruciatingly dull. ""Rope"" and ""Werckmeister"" worked well with the continuous shot because the camera was dynamic and fluid, much like the human eye. But in this film the camera only moves once in the entire picture, so there are no dynamics at all. Combine this with the aforementioned bleached-white lack of contrast and shadow, and the result makes you feel like you're a security guard watching a video monitor at the mall. For 2 hours.MUSIC: To all you ABBA fans, don't get your hopes up. It's true that Benny did the soundtrack for this film, but that only consists of about 4 chords and 12 notes played on a cheap synthesizer. It ain't no ""Dancing Queen"" that's for sure.HUMOUR: This movie is so thick with situational sarcasm that I couldn't tell where the gags were. In that sense it is indeed like Monty Python (which others have pointed out), but--make no mistake!--this refers to the mood only. There are no funny lines in this film. So just imagine watching a Monty Python flick with the sound turned down, and there you have it. Not exactly a laugh riot anymore, is it?HIGHLIGHTS: So what's left to like about it? I'll tell you what: it's just plain different. It's so different that it managed to hold my attention all the way through, as I was hoping that there would be some sort of payoff. In that sense, it may be refreshing to some of you. If you've been gorging yourself on Hollywood action flicks, this might be just what you need to cleanse the palate (just remember to spit it out afterward as wine connaisseurs do!). Doubtlessly, that is why Cannes showered it with awards--it's not good; it's just plain different.But don't get me started on Cannes.The sets are nice--very grand and oppressive like in Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"". I should also add that that the final scene is somewhat impressive (visually), so if you do make the mistake of renting this film, don't chuck it out the window without fast forwarding to the end.MY RATING: I would give this a 1/10, but that rating is generally reserved only for films with animal cruelty in them. Aside from a few gawd-awful nude scenes with old pasty fat people, there isn't anything personally offensive. So I'll give this film a 2."
63,Songs from the Second Floor,4,28 September 2000,"Beautiful footage, but the thinnest soup imaginable","Like in the story from the Grimm brothers, someone has to say that the king is naked. - The king is naked.In commercial after commercial, Mr Andersson has proved his ability to shoot the most remarkable scenes, building a special trademark for himself. You can instantly tell that this is a Roy Andersson scene. The footage is just beautiful, and it is just awesome to imagine the amount of stage building done for each scene.Unfortunately, a film is more than awesome scenery. There has to be a story told. And this film does not have a story. It bends and crumbles under a tremendous fragmentation load. It is so fragmented I start wondering that either I (that might just be the case) or the storyteller is stupid. In scenes where the storyteller intends to criticize ""the establishment"" he repeatedly fails due to either bad luck, or lousy timing. Establishments have undergone dramatic changes since the script was written, and do in some cases not even exist anymore (as government controlled establishments). Example: Church of Sweden, assumed to be a safe target for criticism within the government, as it has existed as an institution for over 500 years. It sure will last another ten years so he can include it in his script. It did not! Bad timing, or just bad luck. This repeats in establishment after establishment. The recession is long forgotten, and so on. Paraphrases are as if they were written by a child; ""society sacrificing the children"", ""the union sleeps with the employers"" and such.I am impressed though by the ability to raise funds, distributor and to execute the complete project with such a thin soup."
64,Songs from the Second Floor,,24 March 2003,Worst movie I ever saw,"I can not imagine a more over hyped piece of dreck than this complete waste of celluloid.  Shallow lowlife that I am, I go to the cinema to be entertained, amused, challenged.  This film provided none of that.  One of the few requirements I have is a semblance of a plot.  There was none.  I also generally like there to be characters.  There were none.  At minimum, I like there to be a point to the film.  There was none.  I have no idea what drugs the 5/5 critics and the commentators in this forum were on when they saw this film and enjoyed it, but I wish they'd share.  I personally don't enjoy seeing someone play in their own vomit."
65,Songs from the Second Floor,1,9 July 2004,May the Arla be with you,"Director should always check the back-story, in this case the bloody history of partisans, instead of looking at ""gruesome pictures"". I am sick'n tired of movies like this. I have seen a photograph of a German woman and girl, they are running towards river. They will drown themselves. Why? They don't want to get raped and tortured by Russian partisans. This was common in Berlin, 1945. Who remembers a German woman who got raped by 30 partisans, fell into catatonia and never spoke again. Partisans, raped and killed thousands of Germans and hundreds of finns. It's all documented, but no one wants to talk about it.Roy Andersson is highly hypocritical, exploitative director. If you like minimalism combinated with pseudo-art crap... see this."
66,Songs from the Second Floor,7,28 January 2006,Surrealism for realists?,"The reason this films works as well as it does is because each of it's outlandish, completely surreal scenarios is presented in such a straight-forward, almost deadpan way. What could have been, in other hands, something along the lines of an Alejandro Jodorowsky film, instead comes across like a series of Monty Python sketches filtered through the minimalistic sensibilities of filmmakers like Ulrich Seidl and Tsai Ming-Liang. As a result, the film (thankfully, in my opinion) plays less like an absurdist farce and more like a particularly strange very black comedy. Although I am generally not a fan of films with such an obviously meticulous, very ""designed"" production design (being a fan of a more spontaneous, natural approach myself), this managed to pull it off chiefly by being just so damn funny. I don't usually look to European films for their humor (being that subtitles rarely translate comedy effectively anyway), but nonetheless this is undoubtedly one of the funniest European films I have seen. In truth, there is very little to the film besides it's parade of eye-catching set pieces (the fairly frequent dialogue comes across mainly as pretentious and is never particularly engaging, although very easy to ignore, and ""character"" is almost an irrelevant concept in a film like this), so it's a good thing that just about every single one of them work brilliantly."
67,Songs from the Second Floor,7,16 January 2005,If you loved Fassbinder and Herzog....,"I was instantly bought back to the early eighties. Sitting in large cold theaters with about 9 other people, watching German films that seemed endless, stupid, amazing and hysterical simultaneously.. And that, is very hard to replicate, but Music From the Second Floor seems to pull it off. Oh, and throw a little Nordic tinged Monty Python in too. This is not an easy movie to watch it takes some effort and perseverance. Yet that has been what is lacking, and is one of the problems with most popular film over the last twenty years . Music from the Second Floor is gritty and gray, and you have to be present while you are watching it. No daydreaming or internal conversations that may distract you from the full on experience. So, if you were one of the other nine watching all of Berlin Alexanderplatz in a two day sitting, this one's for you."
68,Songs from the Second Floor,,27 September 2001,interesting but unclear,"I was eager to see this movie because of the reviews it recieved as a movie which handles capitalism and had great footage. SOME SPOILERS AHEAD*. I've to say I was a bit disappointed when I saw it, it was not easy to get in the movie and to understand what was it about. Although people laughed in the audience, for me it wasn't funny. I think my problem with this movie was that I hardly could relate it to modern society. And I wanted that. It was difficult to refresh known ideas by seeing new perspectives. Therefore it was too absurd and too symbolic. Besides this biblical symbolism are a thing which I've little interest in as symbol and to use this as a symbol for capitalism??Nevertheless It's an interesting movie and much better than average Hollywoodstuff. I think it would be nice to see this movie with a few friends and to discuss the movie afterwards and not like I did, alone. So, go see this movie!"
69,Songs from the Second Floor,10,5 June 2017,"working as both an absurdist comedy and melancholic drama, this film is an entertaining and wild ride!","Most stereotypically ""artsy"" and ""slow"" films are not often considered to have a sense of humor, but Roy Andersson's brilliant portrait of life and death is among the funniest movies I have seen recently, it is also one of the saddest.All at once, Andersson's breathtaking film attempts to satirize, rationalize, commentate on, embrace, and fear the forces of modern society, while also working as a celebration and tragic depiction of life and death, and all their many pains and pleasures. Slow, absurdist laughs drag on with all of the wit and social criticism often used by the greatest of comedians. Comical scenes and images such as the moment in which a fired worker cries and grapples his boss' knee and then proceeds to be dragged across the floor, or the ever-present visual (and threat) of the endless traffic jam spanning across street after street, continuing its chaotic struggle for days upon days. These images are silly and satirical, but they also contain a mild sadness. As the film continues its route through the deepest and most complex themes imaginable, a layer of profound philosophy emerges that both satisfied and saddened me. Humor can still be found all throughout the film, but tragedy still increases in presence and by the final shot I was in a state of impressment, shock, sadness, perplexity, and I don't even know what else. Having reflected on my experiences viewing this masterwork, I have decided it best to rewatch it sometime in the near future, for its impact on me is something that should be invested upon much further- plus, it simply is a fun film to watch if you have the patience! I may seem like I find this to be a deeply depressing film, which in many respects it certainly is to an extent, but this is also a joyous one. It mixes the elements of comedy and celebration with more dark and hopeless aspects. This is clearly the work of a genius who has discovered a successful way to interpret life with painstaking accuracy in a totally surreal and ridiculous style. A real feat!"
70,Songs from the Second Floor,8,7 October 2016,Imagine....!!,"This movie is a closer look at the social scenarios that would spring up if we are to experience a crisis as the one imagined by Anderson. As much as the camera stays aloof and objective, it is a very close up analysis of the characters involved in the story. Just like with any difficult moments in life the pillars are put into question, Family, Faith, Economy, and each shot was dedicated to one of them. The absurdity and the simplicity of the shot is what made this movie funny, because they remind us of something very common and very easy to grasp. What I also liked about this movie are the actors performances, with any movie there is always a feeling of Protagonism enforced upon us though for good reasons sometimes but to really delve into the mass you need actors just like in society of similar mayhem that is why the director decided to hire normal people to do the acting and that is why I believe it took 4 years to finalize it. Now, I call this cinematic style coin me for it, Scandinavian Neo-Realism!!"
71,Songs from the Second Floor,10,12 December 2015,Sånger från andra våningen,"Roy Andersson spent a quarter decade break from film-making directing commercials, and it is from there that he garners his stylistic influences; the static tableaux that unveils a multi-layered and living canvas, the darkly deadpan humour, the still long takes, the absence of music, and the muted colour palette. In one of them, the camera centres on a man checking his lottery ticket against the grimy TV of a bar, before the ecstatic cries of another man, obscured and sitting at a far away table, pierce the mundane affair. The first man reacts to this unexpected winning by trying to rationalise: ""Money isn't everything"", and this is the same sentiment that the salesman of Jesus crucifixes later echoes as he tosses his unsold merchandise into a rubbish dump - who could ever think of making money off this crucified loser? Andersson is known for his remarkable dedication to his craft, and his feature films are years apart, for all the work that must go into them. He seldom ventures into real locations, but works on massive sound-stages at Studio 24 that are meticulously prepared and sculpted to resemble the real. He then decides on a perspective; the camera in SFTSF is a silent observer, never moving an inch, and the selected point of view becomes crucial. When the main character visits a church for some sort of solace in his misery, Andersson rejects the grandiosity and beauty of the architecture and chooses an angle that has a tall, ugly white pillar protruding through the middle of the frame, and seems to suggest that this world is one filled with spiritual discontentment, where the traditional religions have been stripped of their power and meaning, and no amount of swinging Jesus figurines will amend to that. As they approach the new millennium, the film's world is imbued with a sense of malaise, of futility and endlessness. Their jobs define them, and when those are taken away, they cannot plot another path. The silent son in the mental institution seems to be the only one who has accepted this, or is immune from it all, and there is a reversal, as the father is dragged away while vehemently protesting the state of affairs, as if he was the insane one. It is with great skill that a dismissal can be made so funny and sad at the same time, and it is somewhat Pythonesque in its humour; a man clutching desperately at his superior's leg while insisting his worth to the company reminded me of a similar action in Gilliam's Brazil. And then sometimes it is just simple. A classic magic trick begins, and the volunteer cries out in pain, and the audiences laughs as if it was part of the act, and then we cut so suddenly to the doctor's office, where he clutches his bloody stomach. Nothing seems to go right, and the doctor and the nurse are quietly in the midst of a divorce (although the doctor seems to want to ignore the issue much like Kalle ignores the ghostly apparitions that plague him). In the backdrop, so silently and subtly, a traffic jam seems to invade their lives, and it is funny when we have been watching a scene that has not cut for several minutes, but found ourselves only having moved a few metres, but it also serves to bring us back to the reality of these character's lives. They wear a ghostly white mask on their faces, and seem to be haunted everywhere by their coming mortality (by themselves, and by people back from the grave), and will try anything in order to cure this affliction. It is absurd to watch a room full of important officials and businessmen and clergymen convince themselves that a sacrifice must be made, and then trying to rationalise and translate this to a young child. They place a pile of rocks at the bottom of a cliff, and test its effectiveness like any normal bureaucratic safety procedure. Andersson utilises thousand extras, and cars, and elaborate costume, and shoots a scene of such immense and ceremonial scale, that our jaws drop because although a chuckle is given for the sudden push in the back, the bizarre spectacle has become normalised for each and every of the thousand, and that this feeling of dread and desperation is pervasive. He shows it in two other scenes that seem to stretch the deep focus into infinity. The first, an endless row of check-in booths at an airport, and a bustle of hopelessly tied down passengers that tow along skyscrapers of baggage, and take an eternity to never reach their destination. ""Only a few more metres!"" they yell encouragingly at each other, but of course we know that a few metres can seem like hours, and they move diagonally, lengthening their journey (into afterlife, some have suggested). Andersson makes the gradually dragging themselves towards the booth, through hundreds of takes, seem universal, with wooden models and figures that are directed via a system of pulleys and ropes. The second is the final scene, where rubbish and decay is littered at the outskirts of a miniature model city that stretches into the horizon. This is an extraordinary masterpiece of a long take, because of how the figures in the horizon inch towards us, how their haunting of Kalle invades reality and forces him to confront something he does not want to dwell on. And there is a tiny moment of recognition of their humanity too, as they humorously back away as he flings a piece of garbage, and then all the hidden characters in the fields also emerge, and they all slowly converge on him, and what was personal strife becomes a harrowing and universal experience."
72,Songs from the Second Floor,,3 August 2015,Will you be the one who sits down?,"This could be a good test to identify the top one percent of art house movie fans. For an average movie goer this film is a real hell to sit through. Don't expect a fun movie by looking at the ""comedy"" tag. It is an absurdist comedy, set in a bleak, gloomy city filled with pale people who are somehow devoid of humanity. It will leave a bitter taste in your mouth and probably haunt you. I myself wasn't in the mood for such a thing at the time I watched it and didn't enjoy it at all but I can see why some people like it. While I wouldn't give songs from the second floor a very high rating I suggest Roger Ebert's positive review, it sums up this movie pretty well."
73,Songs from the Second Floor,,1 January 2015,Wonderfully stoic view,"Songs from the second floor, meaning not the first, perhaps of childhood, that is close to the ground and just up the stairs, and not the penthouse with its airy , unobstructed view of horizons, but the second floor, the middle space of life, the cramped space. This is the life being sketched, a series of vignettes about quiet unfulfillment with various characters caught in dead ends of a flat life that goes neither up nor down. A recurring motif shows characters caught in traffic jams with cars just inching forward a few yards now and then, car horns can be constantly heard through the windows suggesting this stifled urge to move forward. It's all so effortless and graceful here, a few strokes of immovable camera abstracting the din of real life and bringing to the fore a crystallized view of that deeper reality that hides behind appearances and eludes us. At the same time if the whole commentary here was about a sterile modern life, if the only view that was crystallized was about how life sucks in the alienated West, ""ennui"" and all the other things, I'd leave it for others to enjoy, there's no value for me in calling wallowing reflection, but this is also about a response to it and an attempt to formulate a worldview; songs instead of Bergman's mute horror at the absence of god. So what kind of song? Not actual ones but a playfulness that sings about suffering. An early vignette marvelously shows this, a man climbs on a stage to be sawed in half as part of a magician's show but as the saw dips halfway through the box he starts gasping, actually being cut. Having been stitched, this hapless fellow is back home and as the wife changes sides on the same bed her movement makes him hurt and moan. There's actual pain in life, it's not illusory though we'd like to pretend it is in the spectacles of diversion we concoct. There's pain in being on the same bed with another. And yet the whole film is sketched from a distance of camera that shows this pain to be only part of the stageshow, only acted as part of it, it does not spill on this side of the viewing, it does not try to cause suffering, it does not ""fix"" the mind (Bergman does), it does not sweep us to believe in the illusion of a man having been cut. Having unlocked this, what? The entire film is about characters coming and going from that stage, some of them more obnoxious, but underneath the cynicism there's a gentle view that says these are the games we play, the roles we enact. My girlfriend still found it depressing so maybe this is me. And this ties into something else. Almost all the film talk I read revolves around what makers accomplish or not, never about how we ought to view, as if we had all that figured out and we had no business to grow ourselves. It's the same underlying tendency that makes so many people complain about how bad the world is, this or that, never about their response to it. Always about a lack of beauty and meaning, never about how they can cultivate it. So it is here. The filmmaker has covered a lot of ground that stretches from obvious critique to subtler evocation and maybe he would explain the point of the film as the former but it's his capacity to go from one to the other that elevates it. It falters back and forth a bit, unsure if to despair after all or not. But it's up to you how big your horizon. The first review here harps on about the evils of capitalism. How far will you see?"
74,Songs from the Second Floor,9,10 October 2012,"Disjointed, Unhinged, a Unique, Droll, Dry ""Humour""","Intriguing and/or infuriating in varying amounts, one can't help feel that being Scandinavian and knowing their 'humour', would definitely help, here. But for those who ""get"" the uniqueness of Roy Andersson really swear by his genius, whilst (possibly) the majority will prefer watching their dinner getting cold.These vignettes, of exaggerated ordinariness are almost caricatures of contemporary City life and its inhabitants - few words, static cameras that portray life as idiosyncratic snippets, are based on Peruvian poet Cesar Vallejo's works. Abandon all pre-existing ideas and notions on what makes a film or what should happen within it, clear the mind and let 'Songs..' take over you.There is little, or indeed, no point in describing what happens or to whom. It almost doesn't matter. My thoughts (this is my 4th viewing and it seems as fresh as the first) is that it's Alice In Wonderland, except the colour and acid-trip weirdness has been replaced by an adult version, set on cold, blue and empty streets and in boxes of concrete where people sort of live and where almost all colour has been drawn from them and their lives. It's not a comedy in the usual sense, though is often funny purely by being so offbeat.The comparisons could go on for as long as one's own personal repertoire and viewing/reading history allows - it's inevitable: Jacques Tatti suddenly crops up in my mind.There's nudity, but not as we usually see it - we expect to be rather offended by people that, shall we say, we wouldn't want, or expect see in films, to be naked, or making love, but actually we see very little and they pass onto the next scene as if there had been nothing so natural, ever!Whatever you take from Songs From..., you'll take something - perhaps how this Andersson bloke ever got the money to make such dross and now you've gone and wasted yours on buying it, or a cinematic experience that at least has to be admired, for its audacity - and uniqueness.If you like your world cinema and one from the margins at that, I would say, go for it - as I did. I've never known it to be on TV, or in any DVD rental store. If you hate it, sell it again 'as new'; you'll get 3/4 of your money back, I reckon, via Amazon. Personally, I really rather like it - very much, actually - the next step up from my own state of sanity often seems very small at times - and knowing that difference is the only thing that remains essential!ps - If you are currently undertaking intensive psychiatric treatment, you might prefer to steer clear of this one - or at least, don't tell the doc! The final scene, alone, with all its connotations will keep psychologists working overtime and have them reaching for the drugs trolley themselves!"

76,Songs from the Second Floor,,8 November 2000,One of the best Swedish movies ever filmed.,"After I saw `Under solen', a Swedish Oscar nominee I instantly began enjoying Swedish movies. `Sånger från andra våningen' is one of the greatest, most beautiful society criticising movies ever made, If you ask me what the story line is I will probably not be able to answer you. If I try to explain one of the bizarre characters in the movie would it probably be the man who burned down his company, a strange man indeed. His aggressive way of talking is perfect for such a movie like this. Everyone around him is depressed in some sort of a way.If I would compare this movie with `The seventh seal' It would be very similar, maybe not the movie itself but the way the characters are acted.If you would come to me and ask me why this movie is worth seeing I would ask you if you like paintings, bizarre paintings because this movie is indeed like one. You admire its beauty and will forever be reminded of it.`Sånger från andra våningen' is one of the greatest movies ever made."
77,Songs from the Second Floor,,20 November 2000,I'm still impressed,"Even though three weeks has passed since I saw this movie I'm still impressed by this movie. It's a flick that is telling you something but not so clearly as people want it to be. The movie is about our society today, the people, the sacrifices and the absurdity of this world. Just see it with your own eyes, because some images never disappear from your eyes."
78,Songs from the Second Floor,1,6 November 2008,I can't believe it . . .,"How, on Earth, could this movie have won prizes like Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival and Best Film at Guldbagge Awards? HOW?! The cinematography is... interesting, though. The film itself is unbelievable boring. It's THE worst Swedish film I've ever seen. I can give you a list of a whole bunch of other Swedish movies that are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than this piece of crap. If you like Swedish films, will say. For instance: Låt Den Rätte Komma In, Lilja 4-Ever, Nionde Kompaniet, Livvakterna, När Mörkret Faller, Alla Älskar Alice, Storm, Besökarna, etc.Do yourself a favor: Don't watch Sånger Från Andra Våningen! I'd rather watch Teletubbies 24/7 . . ."
79,Songs from the Second Floor,3,26 March 2006,"aside from a few good moments, an Absurdist mess","This film no doubt thrills some viewers--especially those who are real fans of the Modernist/Absurdist movement (where confusing and annoying the audience is considered a plus or making a commentary about the banality of modern life!). However, for the average SANE person, this film is a terrible picture--punctuated with only a few decent moments here and there. It reminds me a lot of the Gerard Depardieu film, BUFFET FROID--which also has a pretty small but devoted audience. Please understand that if you LIKE films that are confusing and give the average viewer a headache, then ""go for it""--just don't fault me for saying that the average person won't like this film. And, when I say weird and unwatchable, I am not talking about MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL--this is much easier to understand and coherent than this film (plus I LIKE the HOLY GRAIL).The biggest problems for me are that the film isn't funny, interesting and occasionally is repellent. Apart from a singing number on the subway and some obviously mechanical rats running across the street that were kind of funny, I found nothing humorous about the film at all. And the plot of the world falling apart COULD have either been funny or interesting but it just wasn't. Now as for the repellent, I don't like seeing obese older naked women with large protruding stomachs and massive mounds of pubic hair (enough on one woman for the average sorority). YUCK. And, people being stabbed to death for no reason. And, a guy burning mounds of crucifixes and saying ""f--k Christ"". And, later in the film, an old guy sits at the bar and spews buckets of vomit--and we are not talking about funny cartoony vomit like what is seen in the Python's films, either.A true Absurdist film really isn't necessarily meant to be funny but to cause a visceral reaction and deliberately violate conventions. Well, on this level it certainly succeeds, but life is too short to watch unpleasant and pointless crap like this.PS--apart from graphic and disgusting nudity, devout Christians or anyone offended by images that might be seen as sacrilegious should not watch the film.PPS--I love international cinema and don't mind ""depressing"" films. But, there is a limit and this film goes WAY beyond what I consider watchable."
80,Songs from the Second Floor,,28 May 2001,i can see why it tied with blackboards,"now first off i, kind of, agree with quite a few of the comments that have been said about this film. it is definitely quite unlike the majority of films that you are likely to be able to see this (or indeed most) year.but there is just no way that i can salivate over it and call it a modern masterpiece. whilst the film is trying to say something, it is in the way that it says it that is most likely to arouse interest/hatred. yes the film is framed and yes the camera only moves once throughout the whole picture (perhaps we should ask why if the camera only moves once does it move at all?). but so what? is this done for aethestic reasons or because it helps to 'tell' the story?this tied with blackboards at the cannes film festival in 2000 and one can only assume that the jury was so split in what films they wished to award that they chose a 'type' and could then not decide on either of these two. frankly i would have chosen this over blackboards...but it would have been close (oh the agony of choice or possibly the choice of agonies).it shows that there was only one take on each scene and a non-professional cast was used but in films like these (i hate to put it in such a crass manner. but films like this are a type. they go out of their way to be different and obscure and as a result end up the same as all the rest of them) that is un-important. what is important is to deal with 'grand themes' and to be so oblique that it is very possible for people to read into whole scenes, if not the film, everything that they wish to see.its hard to criticise as a film because it as a collection of short vignettes with no plot, very little links except in the case of one character and no character development. yes it is interesting but is it any good? well tastes being what they are it is hard to say. but the acclaim of being a masterpiece appears to be bestowed very quickly in this moderninst era (and yes, i got it. this is one of the targets of the film) but the only true test of any work of art is survival. so many films are made each year that the good are often buried under the weight of the advertising of the bad. but simply being bizarre is not enough. for films to survive they must be able to talk to people without knowing of them. which is why in the field of literature (much longer lasting then films will ever be) the true survivors are those that deal with humanity. films like this which attack modern society are doomed to be lost when the society is different. for this film contains little humanity in its essence within it. it is merely the struggle for survival in the current climate. you could show 'king lear' to a tribe in papua new guinea and they would understand it, you could not show this film to people from 30 years ago and maybe you wouldn't be able to show this film in 30 years time. it is marooned in the time in which it was made.films like this are in reality 10 a penny if you are prepared to look hard enough. opaque and esoteric stories are always of interest but there are films that are out there that say more and are not so obsessed with being different about it.if you are tired with hollywood then for sure give it a go but there are plenty of other films dealing with some of the subjects here that are a thousand times more coherent and in my opinion (and of course that means as much or little as you let it) are simply better. yes, family relationships are a struggle ('magnolia' and 'yi yi') and the modern world can be a trial of humanity but showing off modern society as quite happy to deal with human sacrifce and modern day flagellants seems to merely highlight the issues rather than offering any suggestions. either the emperor has no clothes or he does and you just have to close your eyes (and open your mind perhaps) to see them."
81,Songs from the Second Floor,,8 April 2004,haunting.,"It's as if Diane Arbus had made a modern day feature film, and thrown in some absurdly tragic humor for good measure.

Not for the impatient schlock-lover, but well worth it for all of you fans of Kurismaki/Jarmusch/etc. Good stuff.-Morgan""If Jesus Christ had been hanged, we'd all be kneeling in front of a f###ing jibbet."""
82,Songs from the Second Floor,,21 April 2003,So dull it takes your breath away,"This movie is simply stunning, alot of work has gone into all 46 scenes and they are beautiful every one of them. Great acting, yadda-yadda-yadda, everythings just a masterpiece! IF, and only if you see this film as art. However, if you are looking for a good time, if you are looking for excitement, humour, drama, love, enlightment, value for your money, then this is not the film for you.You see this movie doesn't tell you anything. You have to find out what Roy Andersson means yourself. Every single scene must be interpreted (more fitting: deciphered), and this gets so boring that in the end you'll fall asleep.This film was shown at swedish public service channel 1 this weekend, and towards the middle of the film I began to loose interest, and before it ended I even considered switching channel to Bingolotto, a cheesy program where they give away cars and millions. And when the movie ended, I regretted that I didn't switch channel.I don't like certain big hollywood movies that consider the audience to be total idiots and therefore explains every single action three times, but I don't like it the other way around either. Because I need somebody to explain ""Sånger från andra våningen"" for me, cause I didn't understand a thing."
83,Songs from the Second Floor,3,26 May 2004,"Not a Story, Not a Fable and NOT a Swedish ""Monty Python""","The best thing that can be said about, ""Songs from the Second Story,"" this largely purposeless Swedish film is that its opacity encourages, indeed requires, viewers to impart their own meaning to every scene.  That is not to say that films which clearly lay every director's thought out like a fine smorgasbord table are usually challenging but a director should have a discernible vision which he/she can communicate.Many who have reviewed this film write rapturously about its poetry and depth.  I find none of either quality.  A number of incidents that happen in real life are central to the short episodes: a man fired after thirty years employment, an immigrant savagely beaten by neighborhood toughs (now there's a truly rare event), a man burning down his furniture store to reap insurance payments and several relationships in various states of terminal desuetude or mortal boredom.Roy Andersson was, I suspect, obsessed with making this film (the director's comments tend to support that view).  Certainly he wanted to use cameras in a stark, post-modernist mode to reflect the hope-abandoned ennui of the society he believed he was depicting.  For that creativity he deserves credit.  For the end result, if not blame at least honest criticism.One very silly praise for this movie comes from those who equate it with the classic and in many ways timeless British series, ""Monty Python.""  Some call ""Songs from the Second Story"" a ""Swedish Monty Python.""  Arrant nonsense: ""Monty Python"" brilliantly satirizes contemporary politics and social conventions with a barb rarely found in TV productions (or movies which why the Python cast's several forays into feature film was so successful).  And the cast of Python was brilliant, across the board.  The cast here, largely not professional actors I'm told, is wooden and they go through their paces without a glimmer of the devilish insight that made ""Monty Python"" a must-see for a very wide audience.3/10"
84,Songs from the Second Floor,6,14 December 2011,Songs from the Second Floor (2000),"I loved some of the ideas presented here, but not so much the cold and empty execution. This is no fault of the film. It is just such a bizarre offering that its last concern is the audience. The film focuses on a bizarre city where time seems to have come to a halt. There are traffic jams, and people trying to get somewhere. However, very few seem to know where. One man is scared of the insurance men, after causing a fire, another has trouble with his stomach after an accident at a magic show. It's a film that requires you to sit and study, much like a poem. A lot of it is funny, such as the attention to detail. Seeing a parade of men in the background whipping each other is both unsettling but comical. It may have struck 10 years old, but a lot of the film has to do with accounts, brokers and businessmen. A repeated theme is the cost of business. This is still true, even more so today. Bizarre and interesting, but certainly a challenge."
85,Songs from the Second Floor,7,5 April 2003,Watching a Piece of ART,"Songs from the second floor is a piece of art.  Very weird moviethat makes human life look sad.  Makes Religion look stupid andFiction.  They kill a girl for god thinking it would improve the placethey live in.  They try to sell Jesus crosses to make money thinkinggod is answer to there problems.  These human lie, they cheat,and steal the heart of sad human beings.  Sometime this movie ishard to watch and shows that human life sucks.  You work so hardjust to put a little food on table and then you get old, like the oldperson in the cage thats 100 and rich.  This place is a surrealworld that tells the truth about how human beings are greedy witha Artistic touch that makes it ART."
86,Songs from the Second Floor,10,18 December 2001,One of the best swedish films ever made.,"Roy Anderson has done it well. A remarkable film about some people in Stockholm. It's funny, it's well done, it dosen't look like anything you've seen before. It's so bisare and strange. I think I've to see it again."
87,Songs from the Second Floor,10,28 November 2001,It amazes me...,"It amazes me that the connection between ""Songs...."" and TS Elliot's the wasteland has been so overlooked here; they share, a nonlinear structure, similar images and ultimately the same obsession with the spiritual/emotional aridity of the modern world. Like Elliot's poem, this ""heap of broken images"" only comes into focus once you've actually watched the whole thing. Not here will you find Magnolia's too obvious slogans ""you might be through with the past but the past isn't through with you"", to guide you neatly through the proceedings. I know almost nothing of Sweedish history, and it mattered not a jot that the institutions being lampooned are now no more. What we have here is a study of lonliness and regret, an attack on capatalism and ""lifestyle"" products. Deeply moral, deeply moving."
88,Songs from the Second Floor,,18 June 2004,Really Really Truly Bad and Awful,"I haven't seen such pretentious, self-indulgent twaddle since Elephant. Whoever said that Songs From the Second Floor is one of the best Swedish films ever made is not giving the Swedes nearly enough credit. They will do better and should - with ease. As for the Monty Python comparisons, I am inclined to agree. I think Monty Python is crap too. The themes covered in this film are timeless and fascinating and deserve a better treatment than this rambling essay. There is nothing here to engage the viewer. This is a torturous film to endure and I want my two hours back. Never has my fast forward button finger gotten such a work out. Avoid it like the plague."
89,Songs from the Second Floor,,10 December 2002,Confusing to say the least,"If you watch movies for entertainment, avoid this one. The movie is approx. 95 minutes long and consists of around 50 cuts with fixed camera positions. Plotwise the movie is open and free for interpretation, hard to keep up with and very dull. The movie is hard to watch and frankly, extremely boring. Most critics have given it 5 out 5 stars and I just cant see the point. Does being a film critic mean you just have to love every piece of art-film crap that gets recognized? My rating is less that zero. I might as well rent a bad Schwarzenegger movie and find it more entertaining, sadly."
90,Songs from the Second Floor,,24 January 2003,Bad.,"I saw Songs from the Second Floor at UW-Milwaukee several months ago and the movie still lingers in my head.  Sadly, it does not remain in a positive way.  Songs from the Second Floor is a confusing film that relies heavily on surrealism and an armageddon of sorts, which all winds down through a series of static vignettes.  HILARIOUS? no.  Anything but.  I appreciated the follow up on the man who had been the victim of the magician's mistake, but the rest of the movie was so downbeat and irrelevant that it was impossible to enjoy.I've seen critic upon critic praise this film, but I think all of it is unjustified and merely because the film is foreign.  I love foreign films, but this one left me entirely lost."
91,Songs from the Second Floor,3,11 October 2000,5/10,"This is the biggest disappointment since ""Dancer in the Dark"". My hopes were sky high on this movie, since it had won in Cannes (just like ""Dancer in the Dark"") and also had got superb reviews everywhere. And besides, I enjoyed several of director Roy Andersson's commercials. So what was the problem? Well, the whole movie feels like a poetry-evening with some excellent bits (some of them even almost funny) and some far-fetched, boring and absurd parts. There isn't a story, nothing to tell, just short sequences without meaning. The acting is uneven as well as the rest of the movie. The only truly interesting thing is that in the 46 scenes (and they are really scenes, not clips), the camera only moves once! Still, this isn't enough to make an average film to a good one. Next time, I'll keep my hopes down."
92,Songs from the Second Floor,6,15 October 2001,Technical  a triumph but VERY VERY weird!!!!!,"In Sweden most of the critics gave this film 5/5 and said that it was a Masterpiece.But I consider they were wrong!!!!
It´s a very strange film and some of the parts(there are 46 different scenes)are good,some of them just feels like Monthy Python but serious.Technical it´s a triumph and it was very expensive to make so it´s very beautiful.But some parts are just VERY weird.3/5"
93,Songs from the Second Floor,2,29 April 2001,"Long, strange, Hard to watch","I did not care for this film much.  It seems like a lot of different scenes some of which have nothing to do with each other.  It was interesting at first, but after a while, the dull lighting a strangeness of the film got tiring and tedious.  I gave it a rating 4 out of 10 stars.  There doesn't seem to be much of a plot to it, just a bunch of weird situations filmed in dull muted lighting."
94,Songs from the Second Floor,,20 September 2004,"""Jesus was a kind man.""","""But"", one character quickly asserts, ""He was not the Son of God.""Too bad for the dead-ish inhabitants of this film, who look like they could use a kind man who IS the Son of God. The Jesus portrayed in this film is as dead as they are, a mere plastic character on a facsimile cross, destined for the town dump.The director is guilty of the sin of banality, not blasphemy, since this commentary has been beaten to death for decades in art houses across the globe. If there was any actual hope from an actual God who is alive, the despairing wallow this film delights in would end.To be truly controversial, the director should have shown some kind of great spiritual awakening to Jesus and shown the dead characters coming to life because--as that character would now say--""Jesus IS the Son of God! Hallelujah!!!""Instead he stuck to the official art-house creed, rambling on about the woes of modern man, his alienation, his workforce slavery, his dead gods. There is not one scintilla of controversy in this, it's all been done before ad nauseum (and better!).Save yourself the time and Blockbuster fee. Hug a loved one, comfort a downcast soul, talk to Jesus."
95,Songs from the Second Floor,,6 August 2003,"Ho-hum, deep meanings again","To be fair, there are some very funny moments in this film, most of them dealing with irreverence towards crucifixes.  But mostly, I would say, if your idea of an enjoyable few hours at the cinema is playing head games with the film's authors, trying to dig out every ""deep meaning"" and symbol placed there, this is just the film for you.  However, if you are so philistine that you would like an amusing comedy, or an engrossing drama with characters with whom you can identify, you would be better off avoiding this self-important stinker."
96,Songs from the Second Floor,8,7 September 2002,Morose Scandinavian lyric farce-- regional specialty,"A movie that induces jaw-drops and yawning within the same extended, unmoving shot, SONGS FROM THE SECOND FLOOR leaves you plenty of time to think about what you're watching.  You'll think about Swedish carpenters building one nearly identical set after another; you'll think about Edward Hopper's green-tinted interiors (a lot), and maybe about the late hilarious films of Luis Bunuel.  I know nothing about director Andersson, but this film had some aspects of personal exorcism-- witness an extraordinarily exact recreation of Nazis executing two young Russian resistance fighters. This is not a film I want to watch again, but anyone seeing it projected adequately will carry a few of its images in memory for the rest of his life: my inadvertant selection includes a late shot of a gaping airport concourse that looks like some new kind of bourgeous Hell for corrupt executives."
97,Songs from the Second Floor,,31 March 2002,"Brilliant movie, terrible score.","Let me just say a few words about something that has had me wondering for a while now. I like this movie very much, visually and dramatically, but the score is one of the most amateurish and incompetent, not to mention artistically lacking, I have ever heard. This, in itself, is not surprising since it was ""written"" by ex-Abba member Benny Andersson, a composer who seems content to stay within the boundaries of his own quasi-folk/pop/pseudo-classical style, without any attempt at ambiguity or originality.What is surprising is that a serious and original (at least when it comes to film) director like Roy Andersson would want to use such a score. In fact, on a documentary included on the DVD there is a clue to Roy's view on music. He claims that all music is as good (equating Beethoven with Vaudeville tunes or something similar) except for how it is arranged: a baroque suggestion, of course. Since when was music that mundane? What happened to art? It is obviously important in the movies, so why not in music. This is even more interesting since Roy Andersson has written a book (which I haven't read yet) about the lack of seriousness in our time. Why the would he actively contribute to increasing the lack of seriousness in Swedish films by using Benny Andersson's music in his, otherwise, beautiful movie?The only likely explanation I can think of is that Roy Andersson is one of those few people who have absolutely no ear for music, and if that is the case, then maybe he shouldn't blamed, except to say that he might have asked for someone else's opinion before releasing the movie with the present sound track.It is a mystery to me why no one else has commented on this subject, at least in any of the comments I have yet read. Shouldn't we take music seriously, as we do all the other elements that make up a film? I think we should."
98,Songs from the Second Floor,10,18 December 2001,"When Orwell meets MontyPythons, Bunuel & Lynch","When Orwell meets MontyPythons, Bunuel & Lynch. It's a very depressing, sad film. Sweet and Bitter, like the Chinese saft in a fastfood. You may think: it's absurd. No, it's the real life. An abstract, virtual conception."
99,Songs from the Second Floor,,1 November 2001,Monty Python eat your heart out,"The Monty Python troupe once did a sketch that dealt with teenage gangs in England.  The twist was that instead of teens, the gangs were made up of old grannies called `Pepper-pots.'  It was shot like a documentary, and the narrator had interviews with police officers, shop owners, and family members.   The Police Man says, `We usually don't have a lot of problems with these oldies.'  The worst is social security days.'  The shop owner admits that he prays he won't run out of tea, and if he does, things tend to get violent.  The grandchild of one of the `Pepper-pots' says to the camera, `When the social security checks come, they are spent up on tea, yarn, and milk for the kittens,' and exclaims, `we just want our grans back!'  None of the sketch is hilarious upon first viewing, as is true of most dry British humor.  The subtle jokes tend to be lost on Americans, but the idea the satire brings to light is clear and understandable.  Then after a few viewings, you'll start to pick up on the humor. This all is really just a long way to say that Roy Andersson's film, `Songs from the Second Floor,' is culturally relevant and has a lot to say.  The film is a satire combined with a dry, and sometimes dark, sense of humor. There are a few extremely funny scenes, and then there are some scenes that leave you feeling the need to visit a confessional.  Andersson, who won the jury prize at the 2000 Cannes film festival for his film, has spent the better part of twenty-five years filming this picture.  Set in some indistinct Scandinavian city, the movie is a grim look into society's ability to lose all sense of humanity.  Andersson's scenes unfold like extended versions of his award winning commercials, which he is well known for.  Each scene could be a small story in itself. Most scenes emphasized the idea that society is crumbling and a lack of humanity is accelerating the process.  A few scenes boasted religious themes, and some were just your average Scandinavian-misery-loving-comedy. The funniest scenes tended to be the darkest, and dealt with some heavy subject matter.  For instance, one scene involves a panel of older `experienced' men interviewing a child sacrifice.  Later, the child, blindfolded and dressed in white swaddling, is led to a platform overlooking a quarry.  To the left is the papal court, and to the right stands the bourgeoisie.  A woman walks to the end of the platform and gives the little girl a good shove.  I felt ashamed that I laughed, and thought to myself, `How can I be so evil?  So evil it's eevelle like the fruettes of the deville.' In another scene a `carpetbagger,' with plans to capitalize on the apocalyptic fear of the people, discusses his new scheme of selling wooden crucifixes.  While talking to another man, one of the crucifixes in the background begins to swing, held up by only one nail.  As blasphemous as it seemed, the swinging body elicited, from me, unbridled laughter, and was my focus for the duration of the scene.  Afterwards my feet began to burn.  As I felt the fire and brimstone of Hell quickly approaching, I fell prostrate and repented of my sin. The prince of darkness in `Legend' stated, `There cannot be light with out dark.'  So the reciprocal should hold true, and, in `Songs,' there are a few lighter moments.  One such scene shows a group of well-dressed business types pushing a new Porsche Boxster up a hill, in hopes to start the engine by popping the clutch it doesn't work.  In another scene, very reminiscent of Terry Gilliam, a character, Kalle, is on the metro, after purposely burning down his furniture store.  As he stands there, overwhelmed by his own misery, a powerful sweeping opera opens.  The by-standers become visible, and you notice that they are lip-synching with the music. All the passengers, mouths a gape, sing with intensity and fervor, and the joke is carried on to the next scene. `Songs,' though saturated with simple succinct symbolism, is nothing more than a boring episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus.  Only a few really funny scenes, and the rest is just Scandinavian blah.  I won't ruin the end (what end?), nor will I talk about the spectacular visual sequences `sponsored' by Roy.  I will warn you, however, that this is not the light hearted comedy one would expect to see from Scandinavia, I can't think of any examples maybe there is a reason. Andersson likened his worldview to a mix of absurdity and expressionism. Well, whatever.  Rest assured that John Cleese and crew are proud.  Scared, a little queasy, maybe saddened, but generally proudmostly proud although, never-mindam I fussing you?"
