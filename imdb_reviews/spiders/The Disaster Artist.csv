0,The Disaster Artist,8,8 December 2017,James Franco breaks new ground,"Ed Wood was Stanley Kubrick compared to Tommy Wiseau but James Franco treats him with such loving care that we can connect with his humanity without letting his eccentricities pull us away from him. That, I think, was the most moving aspect of this outrageous true life tale. James Franco is spectacular keeping it true and real in a character that lent itself for caricature. Dave Franco, James's brother in real life is the most believable instant soulmate of the James Dean wannabe. Seth Rogen is also perfect as the one knows that they're in for a major disaster and yet sees the whole thing to the bitter end. I must confess I hadn't heard of The Room but now it's on top of my list of films I want to see next."
1,The Disaster Artist,7,9 December 2017,"""I Do Not Choose To Be a Common Man""","""The Disaster Artist"" (2017 release; 103 min.) brings the real-life story of how the 2003 cult movie ""The Room"" got made. As the movie opens, a number of current day movie stars, including Kirsten Bell, Adam Scott. J.J. Abrams and others gush about the virtues of this ""so bad, that it's so good"" movie. We then shift to ""San Francisco, July 13, 1998"" when Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero meet at an acting class and strike up a friendship. Later that year, they decide on w him to move to Los Angeles, where Tommy somehow has kept an apartment. Tommy and Greg pursue their dream of becoming an actor (inspired by James Dean, among others), but when it's becoming clear that nobody wants to do anything with them, they decide to make their own film... At this point, we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love primarily by James Franco, who directs, co-produces, and stars as Tommy. His brother Dave co-stars as Greg. The real life story is so beyond anything believable that if this were a work of fiction, it would immediately be dismissed as just that. Let me state upfront that I have not seen ""The Room"" (although I see it frequently listed as a midnight listing at my local art-house theater). From everything we witness in ""The Disaster Artist"", Tommy is so incredibly inapt yet convinced of his own talent, it reminds me of those American Idol auditions back in the day where certain contestants think they are super good yet they were horrible. Another similarity is the Meryl Streep movie ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" (about a real life wealthy NY socialite who thinks she sings well and nobody dares to contradict her, leading to a notorious Carnegie Hall concert). James Franco does an outstanding job in the lead role, and I'm going to predict that he will get a number of nominations in the upcoming awards season. It isn't until the very end of the movie (when scenes from the original ""The Room"" are played in parallel with the recreated scenes for ""The Disaster Artist"") that one gets a sense how incredibly meticulous Franco has been in recreating them down to the last detail. Absolutely amazing. Last but certainly not least, the movie features a bunch of other well-known performers, some of them in very noticeable roles (such as Seth Rogen and Alison Brie), and others in ""blink and you'll miss it"" roles (such as Sharon Stone, Zoey Deutch, Zac Efron, etc.). In an early scene of the movie, when Tommy and Greg become unlikely friends, they head over to Tommy's place, and Greg notices a prominent sign on the apartment's wall: ""I Do Not Choose To Be a Common Man"". Whatever you think of Tommy, he certainly is not your ""common man""!""The Disaster Artist"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati on not one, but two screens (a rarity). The Friday evening screening where i saw this at was attended very nicely, I;'m happy to report. The audience roared with laughter on many occasions. The positive word-of-mouth this movie surely will generate makes it likely to have long legs at the box office (at least within the art-house theater circuit). If you are in the mood for something truly different, I encourage you to check out ""The Disaster Artist"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."
2,The Disaster Artist,,24 December 2017,"Not a Mockery, It's a Celebration of Two Men Pursuing Their Dream","Going into the theater, I was under the impression that this was a silly James Franco and Seth Rogen movie that made fun of The Room, a legendary bad movie. That's not what the Disaster Artist is at all. Instead, it celebrates The Room. It celebrates Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, their passion, and their pursuit of a dream.  Sure, The Disaster Artist comments on how The Room bombed terribly; it had to acknowledge this. It comments on the utter lack of acting talent that Tommy and Greg possessed; it had to acknowledge this too. But it handles these details with such delicacy and care that I never felt that it was putting down the characters. Actually, it seemed that the film admired them. Even when the world told them to quit, they never gave up on themselves or each other. The message is surprisingly inspiring.  The movie becomes something more than mere mockery because of the way it handles the relationship between Tommy and Greg with such care and affection. The two genuinely liked each other and saw each other in ways that no one else did. Greg certainly did not understand all of Tommy's methods and decisions, but he understood Tommy's good intentions. Establishing this buddy connection is crucial later in the movie. After Tommy writes The Room and they begin filming, Tommy expresses his idiosyncrasies in full force. While the film crew sees him as a confusing weirdo, we know there's something more. Despite his utter incompetence in directing and acting and all aspects of filmmaking, we still root him. And we still root for Greg, ever the supportive friend. Tommy makes absurd and confounding choices that don't make sense to Greg and they don't make sense to anyone else either. Even one of Tommy's explanations was simply ""people do crazy things."" Still, Greg remains loyal. With as strange as Wiseau behaves, capturing his eccentricities would clearly prove challenging. Give James Franco credit for capturing Wiseau's weirdness in character without ever devolving into derisive mockery. Franco captures his gait, stiff shoulders, hunched posture, indeterminable and inconsistent accent, and his laugh. Watching The Room and hearing Tommy Wiseau laugh, I thought that it sounded completely fake. I chalked it up to another instance of poor acting. But after seeing Wiseau in interviews, I realized that it was his real laugh. To him, the laugh wasn't poor acting because that's what he thinks a genuine laugh sounds like.  Seeing and hearing Wiseau behaving as himself explains a lot about his behavior in The Room. He's just an interesting and very unusual guy. His acting and the acting of others in his movie is still atrocious, but it shifts from startlingly and confusingly bad to understandably bad. And more importantly, seeing the real Tommy makes his movie all the more fun.  You don't need to see The Room to enjoy The Disaster Artist. Would it help? Sure. Seeing The Room first makes many of the inside jokes made in The Disaster Artist funnier and gives a clearer sense of how confoundingly weird the movie truly is. Words cannot do it justice. To understand, you have to see The Room for yourself. I recommend seeing both."
3,The Disaster Artist,8,15 November 2017,A Hilarious Dramedy About The Art Of How Not To Make A Movie,"""The Disaster Artist"" is a true story based on the making of the notoriously bad cult film ""The Room,"" directed by Tommy Wiseasu. Wiseau is played by James Franco and Wiseau's friend Greg Sestero is played by Dave Franco. This was interesting, because I had heard so much about ""the Room"" and its cult status as one of the worst movies ever made. The trailer for the Disaster Artist was really intriguing, and I walked out pretty pleased.This movie has the Franco Brothers and Seth Rogen, and we all know the reputation that comes with them. They make stoner comedies and basically all play the same characters in every movie they're in. That is not the case here. All of those clich√©s from those movies that we see from these guys are thrown out of the window. It was a nice change of pace and pleasant surprise for all of these guys after watching their work and seeing the same stale comedies delivered to audiences.I also wouldn't ""technically"" categorize this movie as a ""comedy."" It's definitely more of a dramedy with comedic scenes mixed in, but this is because Tommy Wiseau, who is so magnificently played by James Franco in what is probably his best performance to date (yes I went there), is such a weird, mysterious, eccentric, and strange individual that his words and actions and his weird passion to make a movie come off as comedic. It's the more intense drama scenes that really work well within this movie. I will add that the comedic scenes shown the trailer are not the only funny scenes in the movie. There's definitely more humor in the movie aside from those scenes.My issue with this movie really just comes down to pacing. It took a while for the buildup, and I get it, it's character development and you have to explain the relationship between Tommy and Greg, and that's character development, but it just felt a little too long. There were instances where I was checking my watch and thought to myself ""i thought Seth Rogen was in this movie."" I would also say that the character of Amber, played by Alison Brie, really didn't move the story forward all that much and I felt like she wasn't needed.Overall, I enjoyed it. Laughed my ass off in some parts. Both Francos and Seth Rogen for that matter are really good in the movie, it's a behind the scenes type of movie that shows you how not to make a movie. I thought they did a really good job of capturing just how strange and determined Tommy Wiseasu was.I am going to give ""The Disaster Artist"" a B+.Check out my review of ""The Disaster Artist"" here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT5-PfMK180"
4,The Disaster Artist,8,9 December 2017,The Disaster Artist is a Funny and Informative Look at a Spectacularly Bad Movie,"The Room is one of those movies that is like a right of passage. If you're a fan of campy movies or you want to call yourself a movie lover, you have to watch it. I watched it just to prepare for The Disaster Artist. I thought there's no way its as bad as people say. Ya... it really is. I didn't fall in love with it as Franco and his friends obviously have but I wasn't angry while I was watching it. There are some moments where you can't help but laugh (I did naaaat! Oh hi Mark) and there were many times where I couldn't help but cover my face because of how awkward it gets (any part where anyone imitates a chicken). But it is the definition of awful film making. I just felt sorry for everyone involved, they obviously threw everything they had into it, they just didn't have the required talent to pull it off. Having seen The Disaster Artist, those suspicions are now confirmed.The Disaster Artist is really Greg's account of how crazy the process of making The Room was and how his friendship with Tommy developed. I think you'll get the most out of this movie if you have seen The Room because with all the behind-the-scenes stories, it gives context to how the bizarre choices in the movie happened. This is effective because you can't help but ask yourself who thought making this movie was a good idea? after you've seen The Room. From Tommy's new style of on camera love making to why they replicated the alley from outside of the studio to film in rather than the actual alley, you find out why. I've seen movies that delve in deeper to the process of how to make a movie but I enjoyed this all the same.The biggest surprise of this movie is they are so heartfelt when they really delve into Tommy's psyche and his relationship with Greg. I have to echo Seth Rogen when he said that it would have been really easy to just relentlessly mock Wiseau and call him a freak. There's a scene with Bob Odenkirk and a room full of acting students where they address that. But Tommy wants to be the hero so badly that you feel sorry for him. Although he isn't always the good guy, he really went for it and that is admirable. His friendship with Greg also is heartwarming. At the beginning of the movie, every time Greg was hanging out with Tommy I wanted to yell STRANGER DANGER! But you can see why these guys would be friends and when Greg consoles Tommy in the end, its a really nice moment and it highlights one of the big strengths of the film.If you haven't seen The Room, the first thing that's going to grab your attention in the trailer is how wacky James Francos is playing Tommy Wiseau. If you have seen The Room, you know how close he is to Tommy as he nails his accent, his style and his weird mannerisms. Some people have suggested a Best Actor nomination but I don't know if I'd go that far. He gives a funny and engaging lead performance. Dave Franco is just as good as Greg Sistero. He's great at playing a very innocent and starstruck young actor who finds a kindred spirit in Tommy. Dave's a better actor than he's given credit for and he's both funny and sincere in this movie. Past those two lead performances, this movie is a parade of famous actors in supporting roles or cameos. Seth Rogen is really funny as Sandy, he's the one who calls Tommy out on his bizarre behaviour the most. Alison Brie is decent in her small role as Amber. Jacki Weaver and Ari Graynor were both amusing and sweet. My favourites of the cameos were Zac Efron and Josh Hutcherson as a way to intense Chis-R and a completely miscast Denny.The hype around this movie was enormous and while I am generally a fan of the Franco brothers, Rogen and they're troop of friends, the only negative is that while this movie is funny, it still fell a little short in the comedy department. I got a couple of really big laughs but it was mostly just chuckles throughout. Almost all of the best parts are when they are directly skewering a specifically awful part of The Room so the parts exclusively dealing with Tommy and Greg outside of the movie can drag a little.The Disaster Artist is a love letter to The Room and all the unintentional laughter it inspires. It gives you some insight into how this movie caught lightening in a bottle in delivering a horrific product that people could still enjoy. To add on that, you get some good performances, a laundry list of funny celebrities making cameos and a nice story of enduring friendship. The Disaster Artist isn't my favourite movie of the year but I enjoyed it enough to give it an 8/10. I'd recommend it to fans of The Room, campy cinema or the Judd Apatow stable of comedians."
5,The Disaster Artist,8,28 November 2017,Loving pastiche of a cult film catastrophe,"Greg Sestero and Tommy Wiseau met at a San Francisco acting class in 1998. A young, nervous model, Greg was amazed by the bombastic, crazed performances of Tommy. Greg agreed to be his scene partner and had soon moved to Tommy's LA apartment on a peppercorn rent.As Greg started to find some success as an actor in Hollywood, a jealous Tommy decided to make himself a star, pumping six million dollars into a film he wrote, directed, produced and played the male lead. Greg was given a supporting role, and the cult 'best worst movie ever made' The Room was born.Like many others, my experience with The Room began watching with friends, before cinema screenings and listening to audiobook The Disaster Artist written by Tom Bissell and Greg Sestero himself. This book is revelatory not just for its depiction of the massive tensions on the set of The Room as Tommy's behaviour cost him crew after crew, but in showing the strange, interdependent friendship of Tommy and Greg.The Disaster Artist film adaptation plays off the ironic success of The Room, now played to packed midnight screenings in a manner akin to The Rocky Picture Show. It is also able to deftly pit the emotional core of the film Greg (Dave Franco), against the force of nature that is Tommy Wiseau (played by James Franco).James Franco is able to capture some of the bizarreness of Tommy, most memorably in a scene where Tommy prances around naked while bellowing orders at an enraged crew. Franco has finally found the role where he can be as weird as he likes, thanks to Tommy's unplaceable accent, black locks, missing millions, and unwavering narcissism.The script is a lighter version of the downright madness Greg Sesestro recalled, and while amusing before shooting of The Room starts it could have done with some more of that deranged bent. Seth Rogen also comes into The Disaster Artist at this point, and is a highlight as the bemused script supervisor Sandy.What is an enjoyable film takes on a whole new level at the premiere, as the loving homages to The Room comes to life. Seeing James Franco do his take on 'you're tearing me apart!' and the many other classics is a reminder of what makes watching The Room so hilarious in the first place.The Disaster Artist has huge fun imitating scenes of The Room, even showing their recreation side by side with the original (one with HD cameras and the other in 35mm, a nod to Wiseau's inexplicable decision to shoot in both formats simultaneously).It's clear the Franco brothers love The Room and its cult fans. This film is unashamedly made for them, talking head celebrities opening The Disaster Artist by waxing lyrical about their own obsession with Wiseau's 'masterpiece'. As one of the converted to the 'so bad it's enjoyable' this made the film all the better, though I also questioned how much crossover appeal The Disaster Artist will ever have to those with no previous knowledge of The Room.The most obvious comparison to The Disaster Artist is Tim Burton's Ed Wood, a biopic of the director who made the notoriously awful Plan 9 From Outer Space. While both are ready to mock their subject's failures, Franco and Burton also have a clear admiration for their subject's tenacity. We can all deride Tommy Wiseau, but what feature film have you made recently?"
6,The Disaster Artist,8,18 November 2017,"A funny, sincere and heartfelt story of chasing your dreams.","Having been lucky enough to get tickets to the Australian premiere of The Disaster Artist with Greg Sestero himself in attendance, I was excited and eager to watch this amazing story. A comprehensive look at the making of what might be the most perplexing piece of cinema ever. I was not disappointed. James Franco is so spot on in his portrayal of Tommy's quirks and character its actually surreal. His first scene having him enter an acting class with the confidence of a rockstar but the talent of a fingerless piano player. Almost all of his endearingly strange lines had the audience laughing their heads off. I tip my hat to him and hopefully the Oscars come calling. He deserves to be nominated. That presents a problem as well. He makes Tommy too likeable. While he was humanised to a certain extent and some solid insight was given into his motivations and feelings, it has to be acknowledged the real Tommy was far more obnoxious, manipulative and plain nasty. It was hard to present an accurate portrait of him as James Franco focuses more on his quirks and his charm and his tyrannical side was a bit glossed over. Nonetheless I gave him a pass and still loved watching him. And hey, you can't say Tommy isn't sincere. Other changes were made to the story and some plot points fictionalised, but that's the case in nearly every adaptation so that was to be expected. It did capture the spirit of the story and was never boring or slow paced, though it wouldn't have hurt to be a little longer either. Dave Franco does an excellent job as Greg, playing him a little more naive and optimistic than his real life counterpart (the real Greg knew he was not making a good movie, while this Greg seems a little more deluded.) but like the real Greg was so likeable and warm you just wanted him to succeed. The film's supporting characters are perfectly cast as well, with Seth Rogen playing a straight man role as Sandy the stunned script supervisor along with several comedians and famous actors popping up left right and centre. The making of the movie is the most enjoyable part and is seriously funny. One of the biggest laughs in the cinema was Josh Hutcherson's first appearance as the room's most peculiar character, Denny, goofy haircut and shirt intact. It was also great to see that Ari Graynor and Jacki Weaver, playing Juliette Danielle's Lisa and Carolyn Minnott's Claudette from the movie respectively, are portrayed as strong willed and thick skinned people who nobly put up with some of the worst working conditions for an actor imaginable. No water or air conditioning combined with gratuitous belly button sex would have probably broken others but they soldiered on.Overall it's a hilarious and genuinely moving account of an insane true story. It softens the darker edges a bit too much and I would have loved it to have included some even crazier parts of the book that didn't make the cut but what we're left with is still an excellent and enjoyable movie. OH HI MARK!"
7,The Disaster Artist,10,8 December 2017,An incredible REAL Hollywood MOVIE,"The Disaster Artist is absolutely incredible. I don't want to go into detail because honestly this is one of those movies that is best seen relatively blind. What I will say is that the performances are great, the chemistry between Tommy and Greg is pitch perfect, and Seth Rogen and the rest of the supporting cast do an excellent job. The tone of the film is absolutely spot on. The last scene of this movie, and what comes after the end card, absolutely blew me away; this film is so much fun. I just saw this movie, and I already want to see it again. I rarely say this, but I can't think of literally anything this movie could've done differently that would've made it better. Everything it set out to do is done incredibly well. I highly, highly recommend this film. 10/10"
8,The Disaster Artist,8,20 November 2017,An absolute must-watch for fans of The Room,"So yeah, The Room is pretty well-known by now, becoming just about the most popular 'so bad it's good' film of all time over the last six or seven years, as has the story behind it- as detailed in Greg Sestero's book, The Disaster Artist.So being a fan of both, I had a good idea of what I was in for, approaching the James Franco directed The Disaster Artist, but I'm pleased to say the film ended up meeting my expectations and then some.First things first: James Franco's performance in this is incredible. His accent and mannerisms are a spot-on imitation of Wiseau's, and he manages to make you feel sympathy towards the character too. It's one thing to so directly portray such a unique individual and make doing so incredibly funny, but it's another thing entirely to make him feel (almost) like a real person, and to make you genuinely care for him. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I truly think this performance is worth an Academy Award nomination (fingers crossed).Everyone else was good too. Dave Franco had a less flashy role than his brother's, sure, playing Greg Sestero, but he did a good job as the more grounded, 'straight man' type character. And some of the casting was genius too- I could list almost everybody, but special mention should go to Josh Hutcherson, Zac Efron, and Jacki Weaver.Also worth mentioning is how well the cast and crew recreated the look of the original The Room- the mannerisms of the actors, the set design, the lighting, the camera-work- it's all perfect. It makes the film an impressive technical achievement in many regards; not simply a funny film with inspired casting and good performances.As for downsides? There aren't a whole bunch. Perhaps the most significant is that this may not have a great deal of appeal beyond those who've watched and loved The Room already. I'm sure it would still function as a good film, but it might lack something for those who aren't already indoctrinated into the cult of The Room. Other nitpicks I could think of may be that the film is fairly conventional in terms of plot- not a ton of surprises here (other than maybe a few cameos throughout). And it feels a tiny bit longer than just over 100 minutes- but again, that's a nitpick. I am more or less struggling to think of too much that I personally didn't like with this film.So as a long time fan of The Room, this is about as good as I hoped it could be. I hope I'm wrong in my views that the audience for this will be limited, and that it does have appeal beyond hardcore fans of The Room. And hey, if there's enough buzz behind it to allow for James Franco to earn an Oscar nomination, then that would be fantastic.And deserved (in my opinion).This is one of the most pleasant surprises of the film year so far, and second only to Tim Burton's Ed Wood in the (admittedly probably non-existent) sub-genre of films about making terrible movies.If you've ever watched The Room, or even just watched some of its scenes on Youtube, make sure you don't miss this one."
9,The Disaster Artist,8,19 November 2017,Pretty different to the book but awesome regardless,"I was really lucky to be able to see the preview screening of The Disaster Artist at the Hayden Orpheum in Sydney last weekend. I don't think I had ever been this excited to see a film, ever.I'd seen The Room countless times and listened to The Disaster Artist audio book twice (which I highly recommend, as Greg Sestero's narration is amazing) so I had a general idea of what to expect from this film. Compared to the book though, I thought the movie was romanticised a bit too much. There were quite a few differences between the book and movie in regards to how things happened and the dynamic between characters. I guess changes are normally expected with adaptations, but I think here it felt like some things were purposely glossed over particularly in regards to how Tommy was portrayed.The film makes Greg Sestero and Tommy Wiseau's relationship look a lot sweeter than how Greg wrote it. In reality, Tommy was extremely jealous of Greg's early successes and was constantly trying to compete with him. In the movie we see Greg give Tommy the idea to make The Room, when in fact Tommy had decided to make it just to one up Greg. On the other hand in the book it felt like Greg really looked down on and resented Tommy; but we get a much warmer, sympathetic portrayal from Dave Franco. In the movie Tommy is constantly referred to as some kind of a monster, but I just don't think we see enough of that side. We're shown a Tommy that is sensitive, insecure and completely aware that Hollywood doesn't care for him. This isn't so bad because it helps the audience really feel for the guy. However, (again the way Greg wrote him) not only was Tommy delusional, he was also really cheap, pompous, manipulative and just down right mean to everyone. I think I would have loved the movie even more if I had seen more of this mayhem in the film. The Disaster Artist book was really candid and chaotic and just didn't feel like the film was as much. I've read that Tommy in life tries really, really hard to protect his image and hasn't really accepted the reason why he's so popular (see his boycotting of the 'A Room Full of Spoons' documentary), so I'm guessing he had some kind of heavy input into watering down the intensity of his character and the story in the film. I think if this hadn't been a factor, the movie would have been even more hysterical. James Franco's portrayal of Tommy was absolutely incredible. His accent was a little muddy at times which made it difficult to understand what he was saying, but other than that he did an amazing job. The bromance between Tommy and Greg on screen was really heartwarming too. I was sad that the movie wasn't longer, because I felt like there was so much more to see and it all went by way too fast.Overall, The Disaster Artist was a really funny, bittersweet, touching movie and I can't wait to see it again!"
10,The Disaster Artist,8,9 December 2017,A comedy with a surprising amount of heart,"Among hobbies that come and go when it comes to movies, the internet film critic persona really exploded in the early 2000s after the show Siskel & Ebert initially started the trend decades before. But with that, many sensations most notably The Nostalgia Critic played by Doug Walker gained a lot of attention after covering what was supposedly the worst movie ever made. Yet as much as they bashed it, everyone still recommended seeing it and that was because of the man behind the whole production. That man, Tommy Wiseau has now gone from complete movie reject to film celebrity because of The Room (2003) he had released so many years ago. Although there are several things known about Wiseau, there are still many basic facts nobody knows about him like his ethnic background and how old he is. Nevertheless, with his movie now having a collective fan base, there was bound to be a movie made about it whether it be a biopic or documentary. Really the biopic was the only option left because the documentary was already done.With a script adapted from a book based on the experience of Greg Sestero (one of the actors from the original film), the story seems to have all its cards in place. The adaptation was handled by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (Paper Towns (2015)), who worked together since their start. The components to the screenplay that really hit home for many fans of the movie, or to those who were indirectly introduced to it, was the overall message in plot and the story behind the making of The Room (2003). If Tommy Wiseau is quoted as being 99.9% happy with the finished product, then it is safe to say that the events shown on screen are true. And if that is a fact, then as much as people think Wiseau is a strange person, he really does teach a lesson to viewers. For us the audience, that means to never give up on your dreams and to never let anyone tell you otherwise. In life there will always be things that try to stop you from what you want to do. In order to succeed, one must learn how to work around it.Seeing that notion repeated over and over throughout the running time is something everyone needs to tell themselves. If this is truly what Tommy Wiseau believes in real life, he is a much deeper individual than many people think. As for the actors who play Wiseau and company, the main cast was great. James Franco who plays Wiseau (and directs this feature too) did an amazing job becoming Wiseau. Franco easily grabs the attention of the viewers with his spot on take of Wiseau. One would really have to sit back and remind themselves that it's only Franco and not Wiseau himself. Playing Greg Sestero is James' brother Dave Franco and although it may seem like cheating, that two brothers are playing the starring roles, the two work well together. That goes even for the times where friction occurs. For supporting actors, Seth Rogen as Sandy the script supervisor has a number of funny lines. Ari Graynor who plays the Lisa character does a good job at replicating the infamous scenes from the film as well.Playing Denny was Josh Hutcherson who plays the character from the original movie accurately too. There also appearances from other actors like Alison Brie, Jacki Weaver, Paul Scheer, Zac Efron, Judd Apatow and even Bryan Cranston. Seeing all of this happen though is still astounding due to the fact that Tommy Wiseau went from a complete nobody on the Hollywood radar for a decade or so. Later to transform from incompetent filmmaker to glorified genius. This just proves the fact that no matter what you do, if you keep pushing the direction you want to go, you will be recognized for it. Tommy Wiseau wanted to have his shot at being famous back in the early 2000s, and now he really is. Sometimes success, fame or money does not come instantaneously like some think. The same could also be said for Greg Sestero who had a bunch of opportunities pop up. But in the end, he's best known for this feature and has openly welcomed that notoriety as much as he hesitated about it at first.The one element to this film that was not the best was the camera-work. Brandon Trost was the cinematographer to this feature and it's a mixed bag of visuals. At times the camera lens flows easily over the scene at hand and does capture a number of backgrounds that are appealing to look at. However, there are moments where the camera moves around while filming like it's being held via camcorder. It wobbles and jiggles to the point where it gets frustrating to watch. I understand the usefulness if Trost wants to replicate the quality of technology at the time when The Room (2003) was made, but most of those times are not used to show that. Trost also worked on Crank: High Voltage (2009), Halloween II (2009), Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012), Neighbors (2014) and The Interview (2014).The music on the other hand was composed by Dave Porter. Though it did not have a signature theme for the film, it's probably best it did not since this is not a film that really requires it. He also made the music to Smiley (2012).While the camera-work can be erratic at times, the rest of the movie prevails in being an underdog story about one of the most mysterious underdogs in all of cinema history. The biopic of how Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero met and make The Room (2003) is actually quite an uplifting adventure."
11,The Disaster Artist,4,26 December 2017,Disappointed With This Much Anticipated Film,"I may come back and flesh this review out a bit sometime in the future. For now I'll just give you the broad strokes.I had been looking forward to this movie since it was announced. I tracked the development with a lot of interest and was really looking forward to it, not necessarily as a fan of The Room but as a fan of films of that ilk. I'm a big fan of bad movies and cult classics. I'll take an entertaining B horror flick with an original idea over a piece of pretentious Oscar bait any day of the week. I'll gladly take a low budget movie with good writing over a big budget movie who's dialogue serves only as a tool to set up the next car chase. John Carpenter movies the cheesier the better(even (or perhaps especially)Dark Star), anything involving Jim Henson / Frank Oz that wasn't well received, (Dark Crystal, Little Shop of Horrors, Labyrinth) anything involving the effects of Tom Savini (beats the hell out of CGI), anything featuring the acting talents of Bruce Campbell or Jeffrey Combs (though no set has ever been large enough to contain both presences at once); I love movies that don't try to be odd or different but are genuine and authentically unusual, movies that have heart and take chances and never take themselves too seriously. I love a good Best Picture winner every now and then but most of the time I don't want something heavy and thought provoking, I just want to have fun and escape. I'd rather see Chucky than Billy Bibbit on my TV, I know I'll be happier. 
I wanna watch movies like Dead Alive (aka Braindead), not the artsier Heavenly Creatures. I prefer Wolf of Wall Street Scorsese to Raging Bull Scorsese. I want Raising Arizona Coen Brothers not No Country for Old Men Coen Brothers. I'll take The Hudsucker Proxy over The Shawshank Redemption. I'd rather watch Troll Hunter than The Deer Hunter. I'd rather rewatch Werner Herzog's appearance in Freaks of Nature (another B horror flick) than rewatch one of his less than uplifting films. 
Sure I could sit there and b.s. and talk about auteurs. I could cite Peter Greenaway movies and dissect and analyze and critique and try to make myself seem more intelligent by watching more artsy garbage, films with bland uneventful stories and ambiguous endings.
Camp. Cult classics. Bad movies. That's what I choose to spend my time on today and I don't miss the days when I was younger and insecure when I'd try to see all the award nominated films thinking they were somehow better and buying in to the lie that being in the minority signals good taste, as if a limited release for a movie indicates that it is ""real"" art and something better than what most theaters are showing. And here we have this very film using that tactic. It demands to be taken seriously. The masses don't have access to but the masses wouldn't understand it. Good taste is in short supply and or so the exclusivity would suggest. This isn't James Franco staring in something goofy with his Hollywood friends, this is him giving it his all and trying to do something more dignified and esteemed. And it's very plain to see that he wants to be taken seriously here. Ironically he is putting this forth as his best work, ironically portraying a real life person who's creation was never to be taken seriously or given the regard he wanted his work to receive. And I just have to say, I don't see a performance that merits the praise that Franco thinks he is due. I think that Franco's expectations of critical recognition is as delusional as the expectations the real Tommy Wiseau had when believing that his creation, the film The Room was this grand work of art. 
That film did not receive the accolades Wiseau assumed were its due. It was mocked. It was declared unintentionally funny and clever by accident. . 
The Disaster Artist doesn't outright mock the Tommy Wiseau. It celebrates his desire to create The Room and to have an impact in Hollywood despite unflinching rejection. And James Franco stated from the start and throughout the marketing of the film during its release that he felt connected to Wiseau and related to his plight.  And because I love bad film and cult classics I wanted so much to like this homage to one of the worst films ever.So many reviews make the same observation their main focus . The exclusive release of the film and Franco's marketing and publicity stunts that involve him staying in character as if he is setting The Disaster Artist apart from the rest of his body of work, it's all built to foster this talk of critical acclaim for his performance. And am not seeing it at all. I started to have doubts when I first saw the trailer and when I saw the actual film my fears were confirmed. Franco just can't pull it off. His accent is not believable. Tommy Wiseau I'm sure is not easy to imitate, Franco had his work cut out for him, but for me he just did not get the job done. I did not find him believable or convincing. At no point in the film was I not fully aware that I was watching James Franco wearing prosthetic makeup and struggling to replicate Wiseau's odd accent and mannerisms. People want to draw a comparison between this and Ed Wood. This is not Ed Wood. This contains absolutely none of the elements that were found in that film. Ed Wood was touching and moving. The Disaster Artist is not moving in the least. Ed Wood harbors a secret and shares the secret obsession that he hides from the world with us audience. He forms a bond with the viewer when he does that. We learn about who he really is and with Tommy Wiseau we still know essentially nothing. Whatever secrets the real Tommy Wiseau keeps from the world, none of those secrets are shared with the audience of The Disaster Artist. We aren't opened up to or given anything personal that would give us cause to feel closeness with or sympathy for this bad director.There was an Academy Award winning performance in Ed Wood. There is no award winning performance here. Martin Landau WAS Bela Lugosi. It was one of the most believable and memorable performances I have ever seen and likely ever will see. I still remember a friend being upset that Samuel L. Jackson didn't win the award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Pulp Ficiton which was the fan favorite choice for the award. I remember sitting next to him in class and saying to him ""Have you seen Ed Wood?"" Catchphrases and snappy Tarantino dialogue might appeal to movie goers, but if you are talking about the actual art, the performance, the skill, ACTING, Martin Landau was perfection. The Disaster Artist has no Bela Lugosi nor its own Martin Laudau. Nothing against the younger Franco, but Dave Franco wasn't portraying someone with Lugosi's level of character or someone with that much personality. He plays Greg Sistero who is your everyday average man. Dave Franco does fine that role just doesn't allow for a whole lot of flair or much of a personal touch. It just isn't a role that allowed for any kind of greatness.James Franco's role did however allow for greatness, he just wasn't able to achieve it. Johnny Depp was simply terrific as Ed Wood. Every bit of empathy for Wood that Tim Burton wanted the audience to feel was there because Depp portrayed him as so incredibly lovable. We wanted him to be treated better, for him to find success in film and in life as well. We wanted him to be loved and were made to feel he deserved better than he was treated. When Wood meets his second love, after losing his first love for the secret he shared with us but could not with his partner, and where we accepted him and his friends accepted him but his girl did not, that arrival of a woman who loves him knowing everything it is satisfying. It gives all the sense of fulfillment that we know is not coming via any celebration of his work. 
We care more deeply than just wishing him professional success. We smile because he finds love and although we see his professional skill may be lacking we know that his heart is not lacking. He deserves happiness and he finds it and we are fulfilled. We never make friends with Wiseau the way we made friends with Ed Wood because the facts just don't allow for a friendship. There is no trust or opening up and sharing with the audience. The real Tommy Wiseau has kept his origin a secret, the source of his money a secret, we know virtually nothing about him. And maybe that is the reason that The Disaster Artist lacks any real passion. How much can we feel for a person that we never really get to know, someone who never tells us the truth about who he is? How connected are we supposed to feel to someone who tries to keep the things that define him from us? Perhaps if Tommy Wiseau comes to write a book and really open up and tell people where the 6 million dollars that financed The Room came from, maybe THAT would have been the time to make this movie. Maybe if he ever tells us what country he came from and what his life had been like and what hardships (if any) he had endured, maybe then we'll be given a true story worth listening to and maybe losing ourselves in for a little while. As it is we are left with nothing but a tale that is shallow, superficial, fluff, and meaningless. He wants to be famous, people tell him he never will be, and so he makes his own movie. We never learn anything personal about the main character and as a result we don't know if he's done anything to earn those things. Would we like him if we knew him? Would we want that same dream for him that he wants for himself? The film tells us nothing special, gives nothing but a superficial summary of events and simply changes the angle of the camera that was on the set of The Room It gave no more insight into their lives. Reading a small article on Wiseau and/or The Room would give no less perspective that this unrevealing empty film."
12,The Disaster Artist,6,10 December 2017,Surprisingly disappointing considering its source material and the talent involved,"I thought for sure ""The Disaster Artist"" would be a slam-dunk based on advance buzz and reviews, and eagerly got out and saw it when it went wide and opened in my hometown this weekend. I enjoyed the heck out of roughly the first third of the film, but then, when it got around to the lengthy section depicting the making of ""The Room,"" the ""best worst film ever made,"" and the supposed mayhem of the actual real-life production crew and cast, I thought it fell flat and became a cartoon riff on what likely actually did happen on the real-life set. For some reason, Seth Rogen, who I normally get a big kick out of (though sometimes his trademark snark wears out its welcome) irritated me, as did other actors laying it on thick with the script's ""wink-wink-nudge-nudge"" too-obvious reaction to the mystery of Tommy Wiseau and his approach to life and filmmaking: I'm sure in real life crew and cast members' reactions to actually working on the ""The Room"" had a lot more complicated depth to them-- especially since they were being paid well and their checks were clearing at the bank as the production proceeded. Instead, we get this obvious, wafer-thin, surface and stereotypical reaction to Wiseau, with well-known actors doing small parts and winking at the camera as if to say ""isn't this funny""--which works for some films but just doesn't work here. Thankfully, the ending section of the film, depicting the premiere of ""The Room"" and all that's happened since, almost saves it, but it had flagged too much by then for me to feel I got my money's (or time's) worth. I like the Franco brothers, am truly a fan of their wide variety of mainstream and independent film efforts overall (I'm one of the few who actually liked ""Why Him?"" and ""This is The End,"" two polarizing comedies that either brought belly laughs or annoyed the heck out people) but ""The Disaster Artist"" is not either of their best efforts. It's clearly meant as a star-studded-cameo playtime lark, but a lark that those same actors likely enjoyed more than we do as an audience--and in my opinion it doesn't serve the real-life people it depicts very well, either, except to make viewers curious about the real ""The Room"" film, and about the people involved in that production. I was surprised that in the end the Francos and all involved in ""The Disaster Artist"" seemed to be laughing at--and not affectionately with--the real Tommy Wiseau and actors/crew of ""The Room."""
13,The Disaster Artist,,8 December 2017,Franco's meta-take on the infamous The Room,"Perhaps the hardest thing about judging THE DISASTER ARTIST is how to suss out how much of this odd bio-pic is sincere, and how much of it is James Franco putting on another of his art projects. The story of Tommy Wiseau (played by Franco himself) is intrinsically fascinating. A forty-something immigrant passes himself off as a twenty-something from New Orleans and moves to Hollywood with an actual twenty-something (Greg Sestero, played by Franco's real brother Dave). Each aspire to become actors. Together, they make a vanity project which becomes notorious as a 'So Bad It's Good' film classic. I personally drove past that curious Highland Boulevard billboard hundreds of times, shaking my head all the while.DISASTER starts off promisingly. Franco seems earnest in trying to tell Wiseau and Sestero's off-beat Hollywood wannabe tale. The brothers Franco use their kinship to give their on screen friendship an extra bit of verisimilitude. As a Director, Franco manages to balance the satirical and the sensitive portrayal of the duo pretty nicely. And, then we get to the making of THE ROOM itself.From there on, DISASTER takes a turn for the worse as the movie shunts aside much of the goodwill towards Wiseau in favor of mockery. Chief among the flaws is Seth Rogan as a fictionalized version of script supervisor Sandy Schklair (the actual Sandy quit during the shoot, and, in a bizarre turn of events actually tried to claim credit for Directing much of THE ROOM). Rogan comes off as a wise-ass who openly mocks Wiseau and the film from the get-go (Schklair has said he has trouble with the portrayal). Rogan's version of Sandy becomes a stand-in for all those who attend THE ROOM's midnight screening in order to hurl wisecracks at the hapless Wiseau. The fact that Wiseau now claims that his is ""in"" on the joke, doesn't make it any less cruel.It's unfortunate that Franco lets this aspect take over DISASTER ARTIST. There is much to praise, including Franco's own uncanny mimicry of Wiseau's seemingly inimitable style (Franco's accent does slip a bit during the 'Directing' scenes). Parts of it seem to genuinely have an affinity for Wiseau and his dreams, and the depiction of the making of a low budget feature has a certain ring of truth to it, despite exaggerations.And, yet... The big premiere scene isn't credible (I've been to many a disastrous screening, and, they don't spontaneously turn into a Rocky Horror style midnight event; my suspicions backed up by first person accounts of attendees). Why the Bryan Cranston scene was invented is never explained (to get in yet another celebrity cameo?). And, why maintain the illusion of a ""mystery"" surrounding Wiseau's origins? He's from Poland and he was in his late 40s when THE ROOM was made. Franco's brave decision to end the body of the movie with side by side clips of his recreations of scenes from THE ROOM with actual ones is quite meta (as good as they were, I have to say my attention still drifted more to Wiseau's originals than to the Franco ones; There's still something to be said about authenticity - even if incompetent).A large group of millennials sat in the back row of the screening I attended. They seemed primed to mock Wiseau at every turn. And, on cue, they openly guffawed at every poorly pronounced word out of Franco/Wiseau's mouth. They cheered and jeered at all the infamously poor scenes recreated from THE ROOM. Even as someone who loves 'So Bad It's Good' movies myself, I found much of their reaction unsavory. They weren't just cheerfully playing along with Wiseau's amateurishness, they were ridiculing his accent, his very gall at trying. Unfortunately, I felt some of that crept into Franco's movie, even if semi-inadvertently. Compare that with ED WOOD where Tim Burton and screenwriters Larry Karaszewski and Scott Alexander openly showed great affection for that hapless filmmaker and his cockeyed dream. Franco's performance is deeper than Depp's in that film, but, it still can't save THE DISASTER ARTIST from its failings."
14,The Disaster Artist,4,16 December 2017,"""I did naht like it...I did nahhht.""","The movie is not as fun as just watching the movie The Room. It does have some interesting moments, such as showing how James Dean famously yelled, ""You're tearing me apart!"" and now that factored into the backstory behind the film. It shows how Tommy had a strange amount of money and made a really bad movie with it.The film never really gives us any characters to root for, however. They come across as selfishly motivated for fame as opposed to being motivated to use their powers to help other people. This isn't really bad - it just means its hard to care for the characters. There is also a moving camera, and it gave me motion sickness."
15,The Disaster Artist,1,28 December 2017,Not that good. And definitely not an 8,"If you have not seen The Room... you might not like this mockumentary. The film is entertaining in a painful way and deserves maybe a 4 or 5 max just for the sake that they mock the original pretty good. Otherwise it is pretty pathetic to the point that you just feel sorry for the main characters. Tommy surely is a very unique person yet someone that hollywood hates to see around town. The creep that brings the pursuit of fame for no reason except the pursuit and totally devoid of any talent. This is a film tribute to Idiocracy the movie that shows how society is just so idiotic it actually is a norm and this movie clearly displays that if America can elect a moron like Trump... then its people can like a film like The Room. The joke is on Franco and his idiotic friends for making this film. Dumb and Dumber at least had some substance. This one only has one issue worth displaying and that is two guys pursuing their dreams..... but it falls apart after that in an embarrassing delusional manner. 
A 1 star because so many claim it to be a 10 is moronic beyond comprehension."
16,The Disaster Artist,1,15 December 2017,Wasted nearly 2 hours,"I've never seen or heard of ""The Room"" and based on this, I won't bother. It's a horrible movie about the making of an apparently horrible movie. There are a few mildly entertaining scenes but most of it is a mumbling mess that left me with a headache. I don't know what James Franco was going for but what he ended up with is a barely understandable character and trite dialogue. Please don't waste your time with this. If you are a fan of ""The Room"" for some reason, you will probably enjoy it. Outside of that, better to stay home and watch reruns than waste time and money on this crap."
17,The Disaster Artist,1,13 December 2017,Do not understand the high ratings,"""The Disaster Artist"" is a story about the making of a 2003 movie called ""The Room"" which was written, produced, funded and starred Tommy Wiseau for an estimated $6 million. It's opening weekend take was $1,800. ""The Room"" became a cult classic and over time has earned more that the initial cost despite dreadful ratings. For some reason ""The Disaster Artist"" is being rated very highly. Half of the audience at the matinee I attended walked out before thirty minutes. I stayed because it just had to get better. I was wrong."
18,The Disaster Artist,10,4 December 2017,"My scene in acting class with Tommy Wiseau just before he filmed ""The Room""","James Franco's portrayal of Tommy Wiseau in ""The Disaster Artist"" is a tour de force performance. Franco's physical incarnation of Tommy Wiseau in ""The Disaster Artist"" is chillingly similar, but even with all the prosthetics and makeup, Franco simply appears too normal to really look like Tommy. You have to see the real Tommy in ""The Room,"" to really understand how oddly extraterrestrial and necrotic his physical appearance actually is (see: Tommy's IMDb head-shot).Nonetheless, Franco's incredible performance of Tommy is spot-on, with his forced laughter mimicking Tommy so perfectly, it sent chills up my spine.And yes, I actually know Tommy - as much as anyone could in acting class, that is.In 2001, shortly before Tommy Wiseau filmed ""The Room,"" we were both acting students in Brian Reise's Hollywood-based, scene-study acting class. Each week, students were assigned a different scene partner out of the class. Students were given a set of ""sides"" (several pages out of real screenplays), given about an hour to learn their parts, and then went up on our stage to perform their scenes before the entire class. Brian Reise would then give the students ""notes"" after their respective scenes.No one in the class, which included some TV series-regulars, could figure out how Tommy even got into Reise's acting class since (at that time at least) you had to audition to even get into this highly regarded, industry-recognized acting school. Sadly, Tommy was totally at sea with each of his assigned scenes, forgetting his lines with each new scene partner, and, fairly or unfairly, the feeling in our class was that no one wanted to waste their time and class tuition with a wannabe who clearly could not handle the material as a professional performer. Tommy's attempts at performing with each hapless acting student that he drew as a new scene partner were portends of what he had in store for the world with his magnum opus, ""The Room."" Eventually, it was my turn to have to do a scene with Tommy. We were both given the scene out of Woody Allen's classic ""Everything you wanted to know about sex..."" wherein a psychiatrist (me) interviews his new patient, an Armenian shepherd (Tommy) who has fallen in love with one of his sheep he had named ""Daisy."" Tommy (whose grasp of the English language is, charitably put, less than fluent) began our scene describing in graphic detail his lovemaking technique to his sheep/love interest in the same oddly robotic, Balkanesque accent that would later inform his frenetic performance in ""The Room."" All I had to do was visually react with stunned disbelief and barely suppressed horror to Tommy's creepy description of making love to his sheep, and I got thirty-seconds of unbridled laughter from my industry peers. Tommy seemed genuinely bewildered as to why the other acting students were laughing so hard, not realizing of course that he had been perfectly cast by Brian Reise for his role in our scene. Tommy produced, starred, and directed ""The Room"" right after his disastrous stint in Brian's class. As far as anyone has been able to find out, he bankrolled the entire project himself. Tommy not only cast himself in the starring role, but also wrote, produced, and directed ""The Room"" in what has now become known as ""The Citizen Kane of Bad Movies."" If you agree with the maxim that there is no such thing as bad publicity, at least in show business, then both Tommy and his cinematic oeuvre have become smashing successes. If any proof were necessary that Tommy somehow had enough money to make and star in his own film and also get into acting classes normally populated only by serious actors, consider this: Tommy actually rented a billboard, featuring a closeup of himself with his signature ""Bell's Palsy"" stare leering down at you, to promote ""The Room"" at Highland and Fountain in Hollywood. It was reported that the billboard rented for $5,000 per month and remained up for five years. That's $300,000.00 for just one billboard, serious dough in anyone's book.And as the fortunes of Hollywood would have it, ""The Room"" has become a perennial cult favorite, often alternating with ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" at midnight theater showings. Now, ""The Disaster Artist"" will forever enshrine both Tommy and ""The Room"" as immutable parts of Hollywood lore."
19,The Disaster Artist,9,30 November 2017,"Far From a ""Disaster""","Tommy Wiseau's move The Room holds a special spot in my heart. Not because it was a cinematic masterpiece, but instead i was able to find entertainment in a constant mess of a movie. Over the years, I've learned a lot of quotes from the movie, all the hidden details and as many behind the scenes info as possible. I was filled with excitement for seeing The Disaster Artist come to life as a The Room fan but even the curiosity of a solid comedy.Greg (Dave Franco) is a young timid actor trying to find his footing as a actor, and becomes fascinated by the fearless actor in his class Tommy (James Franco). They grow a personal brotherly bond and Tommy influences Greg to go off to Los Angeles with him to be big stars. As they begin to feel every door closed in their face, they begin to create their own movie with Tommy's bottomless account. And it wouldn't be long until the movie spirals into chaos and turns into something they never expected.James Franco does a great job as Tommy. A character like Tommy is virtually impossible to play by many people, but he gets as many of his mannerisms, laughs and off beat personality down. As a director, James never lets the movie laugh at Tommy all the time, but he does still inject some empathy for Tommy's bond with Greg, and when the world pointing at his incompetence. He's not afraid to call out Tommy either for his questionable decisions on set and how he treated his crew. There was one great line of dialogue said that the actor believes that Tommy's movie is about ""how the universe betrayed him"", and it actually opened my view of The Room after 5 years knowing this movie.As for any setbacks, they mostly fall in a bit of a checklist feel. While it was great seeing iconic moments in the movie played out, a couple moments don't really connect to the plot as well as others. Also the third act has a bit of a ""Hollywood"" slight sappy moment that feels a little rushed in emotion.The Disaster Artist is far from a disaster and I'm happy as The Room fan to say. It's insanely hilarious, it's hearts in the right place and shows how sometimes our art can take us in places we don't expect. Rating: 9.6 / 10"
20,The Disaster Artist,6,28 December 2017,A good story to one of the greatest bad movies ever made,"Oh hi Mark, I was hyped to see this movie ever since I saw the trailers. The Disaster Artist is a biography of what it was like making The Room; which seemed to start out as a good concept in the pre-production stages, but once it got to the troubled production - the movie goes to show that life can be hard and that accomplishing your dream is far from easy. The cast was noble especially the Franco brothers as Tommy and Greg, and overall, I thought the film delivered a virtuous significance. Now that I think of it, this is probably just as good or even better than The ""actual"" Room! Don't you agree?"
21,The Disaster Artist,7,29 December 2017,Thought it would be funnier..,"Great performance by James and Dave Franco. Although it had its funny moments, I think the original Tommy Wiseau in the Room was funnier. I liked the overall message about perseverance and friendship at the end."
22,The Disaster Artist,6,2 December 2017,fine but unremarkable beyond the concept and a performance,"""The Disaster Artist"" is the highly anticipated bio pic about Tommy Wiseau's infamous masterpiece ""The Room"", which has gained a cult status for it being ""so bad its good."" While I fairly enjoyed the film and had a chuckle that this was even made, I can still understand the problems. There is nothing special about anything on a technical area, the cinematography and directing can range from blah to just plain ugly. The acting is fairly forgettable from everyone except the real reason this film works so well which is James Franco's performance as Tommy Wiseau, in case anyone is worried he did a fantastic job. But like I said everyone and everything else is so forgettable it tends to annoy me on reflection. 6/10"
23,The Disaster Artist,1,31 December 2017,"Only might be a good movie if you enjoyed ""The Room""","Unless you really like ""The Room"" I don't see how anyone could rate this movie well given that it expects you to have seen it.Anyone not having seen The Room will not have the inside knowledge probably required to even get any sense of interest in this movie. First of all, it starts out with a storyline that is completely uninteresting and boring to anyone without a background in the material.To top it off, the camera never uses a dolly or a stabilizer, so within 5 minutes you';; be reaching for the nearest popcorn container to throw up in. (But, I'm unsure totally if it's the terrible cinematography, or just the bad story that's causing the nauseous feelings.)Normally, I don't like giving bad reviews, but really, when you see the overly great reviews this movie is receiving, someone has to inject a bit of reality into this.It's entirely possible that if you can suffer through the first 20 minutes of this movie it might actually be ok, but unfortunately I was unable to even though I really tried.Roger Ebert says that you should give a movie at minimum 10-20 minutes of time before giving up on it. I tried to do that, but unfortunately couldn't make it."
24,The Disaster Artist,8,13 December 2017,"Oh Hai, Film Marks! Is 'the Disaster Artist' worth seeing? Yes- it is!","In 2003, an independent drama, call 'the Room', centering on a melodramatic love triangle between an amiable banker, Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) his deceptive fianc√©e, Lisa (Juliette Danielle) and his conflicted best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero) came out in a few theaters to box office failure. The movie was trashed by critics, with some going as far as to call it the worst movie ever made, due to its lousy writing, camera-work and story. However, the film directed, produce, and starring, Tommy Wiseau has gradually gained a cult following, and much like other 'so bad, it's good' movies like 1990's 'Troll 2' & 1991's 'Samurai Cop', it has inspired documentaries, sequels and books about the behind the making of the film. One such tale was, from the director's co-star & real-life friend, actor, Greg Sestero and author, Tom Bissell, call, 'the Disaster Artist' (2013). The book received so much critical acclaim that it was pick up by actor, Seth Rogen's production company, 'Point Grey Pictures' & distributed by Warner Bros with actor, James Franco, directing and acting in the piece. Without spoiling the movie, too much, like 'the Room', this film was also a passion project. Much care went with being as accuracy to the source material as possible, by Franco & his crew. However, there were some inaccuracies, such as how the idea of 'the Room', even got started. In Franco's film, Tommy Wiseau (James Franco) gets the idea for 'the Room' by an offhand remark by Greg Sestero (Dave Franco) about creating their own work, rather than, waiting for Hollywood to come to them. In reality, the basic premise of 'The Room' draws on specific incidents from Wiseau's own life, including past friendship & relationships; including a moment, when an outsider friend of Greg show him, 1999 Psychological thriller film, 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' in a botch attempt to make Wiseau look bad, by making him look like a con-artist to Sestero. In truth, the idea came from not excessively sentimental, sappy, friendship overcoming all, ingenuity, Hollywood bound day-dreaming, but on accident, with a man trying to expose the dangers of codependency & unhealthy obsessive. The film, originally written as a stage-play as director puts it, serve as ""an advisory warning about the perils of having friends"". Because of that, I felt that the tone of Franco's film is little off. Don't get me wrong, while it's somewhat true, that Tommy had a somewhat extreme infatuated for Greg's lifestyle & did go into pretty dark places, by trying to one up him. Nevertheless, the relationship between them, was awkward from Wiseau's end as well, with Sestero being highly depended on Wiseau's income. Still, the movie was a little too fluff, when exploring their off & on friendship, with each other. As for Tommy's relationship with other people, while filming; it was much worse than what we got on film. While, in Franco's movie, most of the performers & the film crew of 'The Room' was willing to stick it out, for the sake of the project. In truth, many of the original actors and crew storm off the set, due to the harsh filming environment; such was the case for the original actor for Mark, who was replace, late in production by Sestero. By the end of shooting, the remaining cast and crew, convinced that the film will never be seen. So, many of them, never really went to the premiere, nor wanted to go, due to their uneasy relationship with the director. In short, there was little to no support for Wiseau, nor was the movie ever receive, a standing ovation on its first day of release, by audience members. The cult value, didn't really come, until weeks later, during the midnight circuit. It's there, where many of the traditions were born, such as the throwing of spoons/footballs & yelling insulting comments about the quality of 'The Room', as well as speaking out loud lines, from the film itself. It's here, where the film starts to become more enjoyable to the masses not the premiere. Because of that, I found the simplify version of 'The Room' theatrical run in Franco's film, really jarring, and not that realistic. Nor did I like the opening on the movie, with celebs cameos, exploring why 'the Room' is secretly great. That interview sequences in the beginning kinda ruins the ending by spoiling too much on, why certain people enjoy the film. As the humor in Franco's movie, it's really a hit and misses. It really depends on how familiar, you as the audience member is, on, knowing the backstories of 'the Room'. This movie might be, confusing to watch, for some, not expose to such knowledge. Despite that; me, personally, I enjoy the film, even if it didn't share all the information about Tommy Wiseau. I love that it left a little mystery about him. As for the acting, Franco absolutely nail the role, capturing Tommy's eccentric style & accent, regardless, if he seem bit too caricature. However, Dave Franco was a little more disappointing. He sounds and looks, nothing like Greg, nor interesting as the leading man. Regardless of that, the sheer detail that went into the recreations, sequences of the 'The Room', during the credits, are worth the price of admission alone, even if it's a semi off. Nevertheless, stick around after the credits for a special cameo. It's worth it. Highly recommended. Overall: 2017's 'The Disaster Artist' is the 1994's film 'Ed Wood' & 1998's film 'Shakespeare in Love' of this generation. While, 2003's 'The Room' has generally been regarded as one of the worst, entertaining Hollywood film of all time. Let's hope, 'the Disaster Artist' leave an impact, as one of the best. I guess, we will have to see. It's a must watch."
25,The Disaster Artist,1,1 January 2018,Really???,"I mean come on people? The title says it all, what a disaster!!!!!"
26,The Disaster Artist,8,8 December 2017,Hilarious and the funniest film I have seen all year,"The Disaster Artist is about a movie that is so terribly bad that it's funny. Not sure if many have heard about Tommy Wiseau's film The Room. A movie that did not made much sense nor did it have any coherent scenes together. James Franco decided to direct a comedy film based on a novel about Tommy Wiseau's experiences and the behind the scenes with the film. The Disaster Artist is hilarious; it was always entertaining with the performances from James Franco, and Dave Franco. In 1998 an inspired actor Greg (Dave Franco) meets a guy Tommy (James Franco) in his acting class. Both hoping to achieve the Hollywood dream and become movie stars someday. They both made a pact that they will always push each other no matter how difficult it is to become a star. They move to Los Angeles, were they both get denied by many acting agencies. Tommy decides to write, direct, and star in his own movie The Room. Where many film crew questions the purpose of the story, the techniques Tommy is trying to convey, and the mystery behind who is Tommy and where is he from, where does he get all his money when he starts spending millions on the movie. The plot was fun seeing Greg and Tommy form their friendship. Tommy telling Greg to break out into character at a restaurant. Seeing the awkwardness that Tommy is and his weirdness behavior on directing his own movie was always entertaining. I ll also have to say The Disaster Artist probably is the funniest film I have seen all year. There was a lot of stupid fun humor and it does have its charm in its own way. I am sure The Room film is amusing, may not be the highest quality of a movie but its bad enough to become its own cult classic. Tommy Wiseau may have his own fanbase for it. James Franco is hilarious as Tommy. Dave Franco is good as well. There are so many surprising actors that make an appearance like Zac Efron, Josh Hutcherson, and Alison Brie. Overall, The Disaster Artist is a good comedy film. The plot is fun about the true story of Tommy Wiseau and Greg making a film together. The humor is stupid and hilarious throughout. The cast was great and James Franco is awesome with the role. I rate the film 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend seeing the film in theatres or rental, if you care for stupid comedy movies which may have its random jokes every now and then (kind of like Napolean Dynamite). Then, I definitely recommend seeing it."
27,The Disaster Artist,6,13 December 2017,I think a little overrated and not sympathetic enough for my liking.,"The Disaster Artist is essentially a biopic of an episode in the life of the mysterious Tommy Wiseau, a failed actor who somehow managed to spend over $6m on making what some regard as the worst film in Hollywood history; The Room. (It scores 3.6 on IMDB for information.)I would urge you to at least watch some of the 'Best of The Room' videos that you can find on Youtube before seeing tThe Disaster Artist. Better still, go to a screening of the movie which has reached such levels of cult status and interactivity that it's become a bit like a Rocky Horror Picture Show screening or a Singalonga Sound of Music.I mean it's awful. The Room, that is.Here we find out how it came about and that means trying to get under the skin of Tommy Wiseau himself, clearly a task that James Franko has tackled with some relish, as he plays the lead role (and, like Wiseua directs the movie). His younger brother Dave Franko plays Wiseau's best friend Greg who plays Mark in the movie.It's outright weird in places as we try to get to grips with Wiseau's accent - at times he is virtually unintelligible (including in The Room final cut - one of its great charms). He claims to be from St Louis but he looks Chinese or certainly East Asian and sounds Hungarian or certainly Eastern European. It's a bizarre mash up that Franko nails from the off.Then there's the money, where does it come from? No clues are given. And his sexuality? His relationship with Greg is nothing if not close, but there is no sexual advances made on his 'baby faced"" charge who he takes in to his home in LA.Seth Rogan has a supporting role as an exasperated Script Supervisor/stand in director when Tommy is on screen - one famous scene required 67 takes and is captured hilariously here.But it's all a little sad. Clearly we are laughing AT Wiseau not WITH him and it all felt a little charmless in that respect. There's no doubt Franko pulls it off and his brother also has a good turn, but for me I'd have liked just a spark of sympathy for the big fella.The movie has gone on to wash its face and Wiseau has milked it enthusiastically over the years - maybe a little more than a caption to that effect would have given Tommy the last laugh."
28,The Disaster Artist,,9 December 2017,Interesting story but very difficult to watch,"I had fun with the story. Very intriguing. I have not seen the original yet.. but I will search it out now.. The problem with this movie is how it was made, with ALL hand-held camera shots.. The camera is in a constant state of jitter. I mean EVERY SINGLE SCENE.. Even scenes where the two main characters are sitting still and having dialog, the camera is moving.. It is so annoying.. You can even detect the camera operators steps when the scene is moving. Seriously? Has movie making gotten THAT lazy? Do we care that little? This problem coupled with the very short scene cuts leave your eyes in a constant state of adjustment. This extremely short scene cuts is something you would expect on a modern TV show. It almost ruined the entire experience.."
29,The Disaster Artist,9,3 December 2017,The greatest movie about the creation of the worst movie ever made.,"As someone who has recently been inducted into the cult fandom of the Room, The Disaster Artist really surprised me at how much depth it brings. The Disaster Artist doesn't just act like it's a comedy that pokes fun at The Room but gives you an understanding and appreciation of how that insane movie came to be. The story tells how the world kept telling Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero that they would never become famous and their passion project would be the worst thing ever made. The amazing result is that these two underdogs were both proved right and wrong. They achieved celebrity cult status by making the worst movie ever made. While this is a movie about the making of the worst movie ever made, the heart of the story is the friendship between Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero (whom are played by real-life brothers). From the moment a stage-frightened Greg watches Tommy let out his weird performance on stage without thinking about being embarrassed, a strange but beautiful bromance begins to form. Years later after moving to LA to get into the acting gig, Wiseau and Sestero vow to make their own movie when Hollywood refused to give them the chance. As production of The Room moves along, Wiseau and Sestero's friendship is tested. As Greg moves on with his life, it affects both his personal and professional relationship with Tommy. This then has a negative effect on the filming production with the crew and cast. But in the end you still care about Tommy and Greg fulfilling their goals. By getting you invested in these kinds of emotional stakes, The Disaster Artist never feels like it's going overtop just for cheap laughs. James Franco actually gives a lot of surprising emotional depth to his portrayal of Tommy Wiseau. Franco nails Wiseau's mysterious (maybe European) accent and bizarre pattern of speech but goes the extra mile to show how emotional insecure he is. There are times it is easy to laugh at Tommy since his naivety and lack of talent or experience portrays him as a fool. Other times his obsession with his vision antagonizes those around him while in certain moments you almost shed a tear for him because you feel his internal pain of being rejected by the world. Like some are already talking about, I do think it is worth putting Franco's name into consideration for the Oscars as best lead actor. Dave Franco should also be given credit as Greg Sestero, Wiseau's real-life friend, co-star and producer of The Room. As the only sane person who is close to understanding Tommy, Greg must try to keep things in check with him. But because Greg feels like he owes him for helping him with his career it causes him to enable Tommy with his ludicrous decision-making at the cost of their relationship. Seth Rogen is once again hilarious this time as the script supervisor Sandy Schklair. Here he serves as the audience's perspective into The Room by questioning the absurdity of Tommy's decisions and creative process. For the most part The Disaster Artist does not rely on audience already having an experience with The Room to love it. However you might have more of an understanding having seen The Room to get some gags and little easter eggs relating to it. The Disaster Artist at first may seem like a mocking at bad filmmaking but in the end its true message comes down to the value of friendship and having an appreciation for fulfilling your passion and dream even if not every agrees with it. It is easily one of my favourite surprises of this year"
30,The Disaster Artist,8,14 January 2018,Such a surreal experience.,"Very few times do we get to see an actor playing another actor so well, so crafty done.James Franco has excelled my expectations for the movie. Mind you, I am not a huge fan of The Room but I did get a ""What the hell am I watching?"" feeling when I saw it. 
I can honestly say watching this movie it almost feels like a companion to The Room, as it was as surreal and sometimes uncomfortable to watch but in a really good way.They have also managed to make it a funny movie, granted Wiseau is a funny character or caricature himself but as to emulate that so vividly without being disrespectful is a whole different achievement, one that is totally worthy of any awards you want to throw at it, especially on Franco, this is his definite performance."
31,The Disaster Artist,8,10 December 2017,An homage to a love of movies and making them,"Tim Burton showed how much he loves movies by giving us Ed Wood, and James Franco has shown a similar affection with The Disaster Artist. Although I firmly believe Troll 2 is a far worse movie than The Room, it was only a matter of time before someone made a movie about the making of a movie considered by many to be the worst movie ever made.That's not fair, of course, to The Room. What made The Room a cult classic is that it is not the worst movie ever made, but simply a jarring sequence of non sequiturs, whether dialogue-based or editing-based, and a handful of side plots which barely spin up, never to be returned to again. It's a cult classic not because it's a bad movie, it's a cult classic because it's unfathomable that anyone could make a movie like that with so much passion and think it was a masterpiece, but that's what Tommy Wiseau did, and as Greg Sestero points out, not even Alfred Hitchcock was talented enough to accomplish that.James Franco proves we need a stronger word than Schadenfreude at times, perhaps ""super-duper-√ºber-schadenfreude."" Much like the neon sign shaped like Hitchcock's face in Rope, we see that Tommy and Greg live in an apartment building called OJAI (""O hai!"") and wow does Josh Hutcherson look terrible with Denny's hair.Too bad Franco chose to open the film with real-life ""tributes"" from such famous film critics as Adam Scott, and too bad he chose to close the film with a series of side-by-side comparisons of his version against the original Wiseau vision. Those last scenes smacked of Peter Sellers and the blooper credits from Being There, so out of place that many believed they cost him an Oscar.Tommy Wiseau is not as mysterious as he wants to be. He's probably a vampire. Who cares?"
32,The Disaster Artist,8,8 December 2017,Fills In The Background,"I saw ""The Disaster Artist"", starring James Franco-The Interview, General Hospital_tv; Dave Franco-The Now You See Me movies, Warm Bodies; Ari Graynor-Bad Teacher_tv, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist and Seth Rogen-The Neighbors movies, Zack and Miri Make a Porno. This is a movie that shows how another movie-The Room-got made. If you have never seen The Room-a 2003 cult movie-I highly recommend you watch it before you see The Disaster Artist and you will enjoy it even more. If you haven't seen it, you can still enjoy this one, but it's just better otherwise. James plays Tommy Wiseau, the eccentric-and that is putting it mildly-actor that meets Dave, playing Greg Sestero, another more normal actor and they become fast friends. Both are struggling to find work and finally decide to just make their own movie, with James/Tommy writing, producing, directing and starring and Dave/Greg co-starring. FYI: This is the first time that James & Dave have made a movie together. When I said James/Tommy was eccentric, besides his acting being over the top, he was very mysterious about himself. When asked where he was from, he would say, New Orleans, and you could tell from his accent that he was European-I later learned it was Poland. He was also evasive about his age-he looked to be in his 40's but said he was in his 20's. He had lots of money but no discernible income-my guess would be inherited. He would laugh at inappropriate moments for no reason. Ari plays the love interest in the movie and Seth is a script consultant. There are lots of cameos, both of James' real life buddies and other actors-I remember seeing Melanie Griffith, Alison Brie, Sharon Stone, Zac Effron and Bryan Cranston-and James directs this movie, which is based on a book written by the real Greg Sestero. Tommy & Greg both make cameos. As the end credits start, they divide the screen, showing scenes of both movies, side by side. And make sure that you stay after the end credits for an extra scene-you won't be disappointed. The movie fills in the background of The Room and how it came to be. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."
33,The Disaster Artist,9,9 December 2017,Incredible Performance by James Franco,"Recently viewed the movie on Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF). It was a great movie and impeccable act by James Franco. Frankly, i would not have had the chance, unless my spouse picked it among many others. You can see on the net people suggest you watch the Room, Citizen Kane of the worst movies ever filmed, as a prerequisite; believe me, it is not a suggestion. Please watch the Room (2003) before going to Disaster Artist. You will have so much more if you do."
34,The Disaster Artist,9,16 January 2018,"A Hilarious and Surprisingly Heartfelt Film,","The Disaster Artist is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is advertised as being a comedy, while it is delightfully funny and had me in stitches on many occasions, I was very surprised at how much depth and emotion there was in it. James Franco really made sure that he was not just making fun of this bizarre true story, but told it in a way that got us to sympathise with Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero, and I really did. We all desire greater things in life, most people have a dream, watching these people go out and pursue that, and the downfall that it leads to, was genuinely soul crushing for someone who is involved in a similar industry, which was conveyed in a very blunt, honest manner. My only real issue was that I did not find it focused on the making of ""The Room"" enough. While it is still the main bulk of the movie, there is far too much fleshing out of the story beforehand that I did not find necessary, anyone going to see this film wants to know how another infamous movie was made, they should have gotten to the punchline a little faster. The performances are all around marvellous. James and Dave Franco are, of course, the highlight as Tommy and Greg, the comfort they have with one another, being real life brothers, is very apparant, and it really is a pleasure to watch them perform together for the very first time. Their characterisation in both parts is very accurate and completely unlike them, they are also joined by a star studded cast in smaller, but memorable, roles that includes Seth Rogen, Josh Hurcherson, Alison Brie and Zac Efron. A great ride that had me experiencing many different emotions. Funny, meaningful and tremendously acted, I would highly recommend The Disaster Artist to anyone looking for a good comedy drama.
Close friends Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero move to LA to pursue a career as actors. When nothing works out for them, Tommy decides to make his own movie. 
Best Performance: James Franco"
35,The Disaster Artist,10,16 January 2018,A Masterpiece!,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece! James Franco is an absolute genius. The way in which he's portrayed the character of Tommy is absolutely incredible. The last scene of the movie had me in splits! By the end of it, I wanted to see it again. Highly Highly recommended. Leave aside whatever you're doing and watch The Disaster Artist!
10/10"
36,The Disaster Artist,2,15 January 2018,Disaster indeed!,"Why should one go back over a complete misfire of a movie, like Wiseau's THE ROOM, or Ed Wood's work? At least the latter, of the late 1990s, featuring Johnny Depp, had awesome performances in Depp and Landau. In this one, much as I might try, I could only be annoyed by Wiseau's accent and repeated stupidity. Dave Franco does well in his part, but it is not exactly memorable, either.Perhaps I'll be accused of lacking humor, but I could not see anything funny about Wiseau's extravagant behavior and the derision with which it was received by the rest of the crew. This movie within a movie drove me to snoozing about 25' into it, and thank God that I was able to catch on my sleep at least. In the end, this film pays homage to a complete failure. Perhaps it's symbolic of the way moviemaking is going, bereft of ideas, and increasingly unrealistic productions that teach one absolutely nothing about life and how hard it is to survive just the day to day.2/10 - mostly for Dave Franco's sympathetic and humane performance."
37,The Disaster Artist,1,15 January 2018,The original was actually watchable,"Watched ""The Room 2003"" then this back to back. The Room is strangely watchable but watching this was like listening to a drunk uncle trying to remember a joke. Perhaps in 15 years someone will make a movie about how bad this one is. It's a pity they cut the scene at the end when Logan Paul found the body, that was the best part."
38,The Disaster Artist,7,15 January 2018,good movie with alot of flaws,"Disaster Artist was kind of dissapointing. James Francos perfonmance is the reason this movie works basicaly best part of the movie cause he has that raw talent. Other actors were fine, Dave Franco was fine tho even if he basicaly played himself. The first half of the movie when tommy and greg are friends and stuff are so good and them trying to be in the movie i mean its perfect first act, second act when they start shooting room is ok tho they go more with shit like why is he having sex with her navel tho they are funny and i like that they recreated the scenes like how it was. Third act is bad and ruins the movie like when people are laughing is so bad and the fact that he immedietaly after says its a dark comedy isnt how it happened. But i recommend it watching i would give it 6/10 but since i admire the fact someone made a movie about this i gave it 7/10."
39,The Disaster Artist,4,15 January 2018,Confusing and awkward portrait of The Room.,"I have to admit off the bat: I have not seen and have no intentions of seeing ""The Room"". Why sitting through an awful movie has a cult following only lowers the bar for engaging and entertaining movie scripts, something that seems to be affecting the movie industry as a whole. I honestly think money is the only thing driving the success of ""The Room"" and that the ""cult following"" has been completely manufactured. What I can't understand is how ""The Disaster Artist"" is receiving such positive reviews. The plot is bland and scenes are uninteresting. The story contains no major plot twists or anything to engage the viewers. Characters are not established well, scenes are disjointed: the movie feels bland.How on earth James Defranco got the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy is beyond me. Nothing James Defranco's Tommy Wiseau says is particularly funny, it's literally making fun of a man that may have mental health issues. There was no difficulty or complexity in creating the Tommy Wiseau character for ""The Disaster Artist"", all that was needed is a funny accent, a wardrobe copy and mirroring the shots from ""The Room"". That's not great comedy.Overall I am disappointed in this movie given the amount of hype it generated. It seemed like the cast and crew were piggybacking off the artificially created cult following of ""The Room"". If anything the nomination win and success of the movie shows how emotionally out of touch Hollywood is at the moment."
40,The Disaster Artist,10,14 January 2018,Franco Franco Franco you're tearing me apart !,"This bizzare take on the novel written by Greg Sestero about the making of the legendary bad cult-classic the Room, is a movie so well-done funny and brillant, where James Franco delivers one of the best performance for years to come in comedy ! Follow-up a great Oscar caliber movie about the making of the worst movie ever made ! Acting: 10/10: James Franco is amazing brillant he delivers that performance that make me quote myslef how can he be that good, he imitates Tommy Wiseau so damn well, with the voice the style the weirdest in it, it like if Franco waited his whole life to play this role! The rest of the cast are great too, simply kind of forgettable because of Franco's performance!Directions: 8/10: It felt slow sometimes ..... yet it was done really well, you just have to see the Room too get that this movie was done perfectly! Franco, Seth really are pretty much the only one that can always come up with an hillarious movie in the past years! What a duo !Humor: 10/10: Hilarious one of the movie I have laughed the most at ! Every humor comes with James performances is take on Wiseau is insane ! Can't say much I just loved the humor and rarely laughed that much !Enjoyment: 10/10: Hands down the best way to start 2018 for me was to watch The Disaster Artist not sure someone will beat this movie off my list this year ! It one hell of a comedy and it an honour for us Room fans to see this beautiful movie ! (yess 2018 since here in Montr√©al it was limited and had to go really far to see it !)"
41,The Disaster Artist,,14 January 2018,Brother Franco's fun piece,"""The disaster artist"" is a movie about making a movie. While this is not exactly a ""genre"", it's something that appeals to filmmakers. Coming to mind right away is Truffaut's ""Day for night"" (1973). A bit more recent is this little gem of a movie ""Super 8"" (2011). Movie about making a movie. I am sure there are quite a few others.The movie tells (not ""based on"", but truly ""tells"") the story of the making of ""The room"" (2003), together with the parallel story of a somewhat (but not exceedingly) strange friendship between Tommy Wiseau (James Franco, who won a Golden Globe for his trouble) and Greg Sestero (Dave Franco, James's brother).Clocking in with an IMDb user average rating of 3.6, ""The room"" is considered by many as a serious contender of the worst movie ever made. How did this come by? Well, it started with a chance meeting of Wiseau and Sestero in an acting class. The audience is shown Sestero first, doing a pathetically tentative ""Waiting for Godot"", with mispronouncing the name in the title to boot. Young, handsome and disarming as Sestero is, it is painfully obvious that the single most important ingredient for an actor is missing: confidence. Wiseau is something else. When his turn comes, he keeps repeating the one name that is among the best known in stage plays, ""Estella!"" as uttered by Stanley Kowalski in ""A streetcar named Desire"". Wiseau seems to be making a career out of this one word, spitting it out using an assortment of equally incomprehensible expressions and body movements which includes climbing up the side of the stage in the style of Caesar (""Planet of the Apes"" rebooted series). One person (the only one, most likely) witnessing this outburst is impressed. After class, Sestero approaches Wiseau asking for help in acting. The next thing we know, the two become friends and comrades, heading out to L.A. in a quest to fulfill their dreams and aspirations in the film industry.After an energetic start, while Sestero at least manages to get himself signed by an agent (but with no ensuing action), Wiseau is a complete washout. What follows is the meat of ""The disaster artists"": recreating the drama of the making of ""The room"", a project that Wiseau undertakes, financed by what seems an inexhaustible source of funds available to him. The rest is history. The ""The room"" was a total flop at initial release but managed to acquire a new life as a minor cult.
 
It is about time James Franco wins a major award as he did here with the acting (he also directed ""The disaster artist""). There are several concurrent Golden-Globe-honored movies with portrayals of real life persons, the success of which requires the actor to dematerialize himself/herself and inhabit the character. Gary Oldman is stunning with Churchill, won, and will no doubt go on with a clean sweep of all best actor awards all the way to March 4 (Oscar). Emma Stone did not win with Billie Jean King but did a commendable job. Franco shares Oldman's honor by his own win in the ""Comedy/Musical"" category here, fully deserving. Fortunate for him that Golden Globe has this category. Franco plays Wiseau with gusto and fun, leaving out the Dark Side of The Force in Wiseau, a wise decision.Brother Dave Franco as an easier job of playing a normal person, which he discharged with honor. The rest of the cast includes some familiar faces which are a delight to behold. Seth Rogen plays the straight-face, business-serious script supervisor. Jackie Weaver is in a couple of scene stealing cameos as one of the actors engaged for ""The room"". A little more than a cameo, playing another actor, is Josh Hutcherson whose face is impossible to miss after his ""Hunger Game"" and ""Journey"" movie franchises appearance. A big bonus is the epilogue which shows a dozen scenes on making ""The room"" as seen earlier. Now you see these scene again, a split screen parallel with the original scene from ""The room"". The meticulous re-creation (dialogue, acting, and down to every detail under the Art Direction department) of these scenes will take your breath away as well as hit you with an uncanniness that is almost creepy. I don't remember seeing this done anywhere else, and cannot help thinking what something like this will look like for ""Psycho"" (1998), Gus Van Sant's re-ake that purportedly replicated the original shot-by-shot."
42,The Disaster Artist,8,13 January 2018,James Franco's Ed Wood,"Funny recreation of what happen before, during and after the shooting of one of the officially worst pictures of all times, that became successful after gaining enormous cult status. It is James Franco's ""Ed Wood"" and it really does work as a modern times ""Ed Wood"" and does not really hide behind the classic Tim Burton film.
The film is slick, funny with many dramatic undertones. Its a great film about friendship, trust and the desire to be popular and loved. In that sense it is a film with topics that are relevant to pretty much everybody, even if everybody is not as freaky, weird and eccentric as Tommy Wiseau. James Franco fantastically takes on that role and gives one of the best performances of his career. He really turned into him and perfectly adapted his mannerisms. If that character appeared in any other film you probably would doom it to be unbelievable, but its a person that truly exists and Franco marvelously pays tribute to this cult personality. It is also one of Franco'S best directional efforts as I was never a big fan of his films before. His brother Dave Franco is extremely underrated for his turn as Greg Sestero. Its a strong character and Dave Franco plays it with such a gray self confidence and persuasion. His best performance to day. Seth Rogen had a fun supporting part. Some really good cameos by Sharon Stone, Bryan Cranston and many others. 
A light movie that hides a tragic human story beneath."
43,The Disaster Artist,10,11 January 2018,Fantastic,"I must be honest when I say I have never seen ""The Room"" and when watching this movie I though plenty of times about how I wouldn't be able to get some of the jokes and events that are occurring. But by the end of the movie, I realized I didn't need to, I loved this movie, and it is the best film I saw of 2017. First of all, there is James Franco, who kills it in this movie, you can tell that he has respect for Tommy Wiseau in his performance and how he wants to be as accurate as possible in this performance. I felt like he was actually Wiseau himself. The rest of the performances are phenomenal as well. Dave Franco, Seth Rogen, and all of the rest of the cast are great at what they do. However what also must be stated is the content of the movie itself, because when you look back at the reputation of ""The Room"" and how this movie was made, you realize how easy this movie could have been made. It would've been so easy to take cheap shots at Wiseau and bash on the room by saying how it is going to be so bad and how it ended up being that bad, but the movie doesn't do that. The movie goes in the direction of the why of Wiseau, about how he was not accepted by most of society and decides to make a movie to prove to everybody that he is worth something, which is a really powerful message. Granted, you do get some laughs in this movie, because the movie does highlight the absurd production process of the film, but this movie has layers, and when given these layers, you not only a have comedy telling the stories of production, but you have a heartwarming tale of friendship, struggle, success, and ultimately acceptance, and you walk out of the theater liking the movie more as you think about it. This was the best film I saw in 2017. 10/10"
44,The Disaster Artist,10,10 January 2018,James Franco showed us again what a a great actor he is.,"It's kinda ironic that this movie,which is a big succes on Rotten Tomatoes and other well known sites,is based on the worst movie ever.
Another thing that I liked was the fact that James Franco is the director and the main actor of this movie,just like Tommy Wiseau is the director and the main actor of his movie,The Room.
Another similarity that I found at these movies was the fact that both this movie and The Room are more of a comedy movie than a drama.
The thing is that,even though The Room is described as ''the Citizen Kane of bad movies,the people enjoyed the movie and they treated as a comedy.
Even now you can found some people who will say that they really enjoyed seeing the movie,even though it is bad.
As for Tommy Wiseu? It's kinda strange that a celebrity like him never told the audience how old is he,from where does he haves that many money and from where he really is.
The irony is that a guy like him,who wanted to be famous,doesn't want the world to know how he is and from where he is.
Overall,the movie is really great,fun and full with funny moments and with a lesson:""If a lot of people loved each other, the world would be a better place to live. See The Room, have fun, and enjoy life. The American Dream is alive, and it's real.""-Tommy Wiseu."
45,The Disaster Artist,8,10 January 2018,James Franco in one of his best acting roles in very good and very funny film.,"I did not watch Tommy Wiseau's The Room so maybe if I watch it I like it even more The Disaster Artist, which I really liked the movie, is a biographical movie with a good humor and good performances, The Room is considered the worst movie ever made, and to make a biography of how it was the production of this film is a challenge, and manages to be an engaging film and that does not lose the rhythm in no time, James Franco is the director and the protagonist in the film, is without doubts its better film as director, already as an actor is arguable, he commands very well, the makeup is very well done and at the time of having to be a bad actor he commands very well too, Dave Franco does a competent performance, and the rest of the cast does well its part, the characterization is great, the actors look very much like the real people, the soundtrack is cool and the end of the movie is very good and funny, the movie has its slips, dialogs cliches, and I did not like that Tommy Wiseau seems to act poorly until when it's not in the movie, and some characters have been misused, but The Disaster Artist is very good and worth watching. 8.1"
46,The Disaster Artist,6,8 January 2018,One from the artist's heart.,"Obviously a deeply personal film, Franco's latest (before the tide of four films almost ready for this year), is one from the heart, not so much for cinema itself as for the pathos that drives some people to create cinema.
Even if you don't get the real ""Room"" allusions, even if this poor man's (a bit moody) Cassavetes is not your cup of tea (let alone if you haven't seen your ""Ed Wood"" several times over), ""The Disaster Artist"" almost perfectly captivates the moment when a work of ""art"" is revered for the polar opposite reasons it was made while at the same time exposing its auteur's heartbreaking need for recognition and addressing the perennial idea that art, like truth, is in the eyes of the beholder.
Not a small feat."
47,The Disaster Artist,8,8 January 2018,A funny engaging worthwhile addition to the greatness of the Room,"The Disaster Artist: Directed by James Franco. Written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. WeberThis is an adaptation of the book about the making of one of the greatest bad movies ever made The Room. Tommy Wiseau is a character in real life. He is an enigma. You're drawn into his way of thinking and his complete disregard for what other people think. He believes wholeheartedly that he's going to make it and in a way he did. The Room is a cult classic. It is played all across the country and has been riffed countless times. As you watch things unfold, you're perplexed by the reactions of people dealing with Tommy's whirlwind personality. Greg is swept up into it and eventually we end up shooting The Room. Their relationship as friends and creative partners is the core of this movie. Tommy wants Greg to be in this one hundred percent and when Greg starts to date someone or gets offered a part in a TV show, his jealousy rears its ugly head. The production spirals out of control and nobody knows what to think or how any of this will turn out.This is a very funny movie. You really don't need to know anything about The Room to get something out of this movie. It has moments where it feels like Ed Wood but it represents something else. Moments of reality seep in and genuinely affects Tommy whereas Ed Wood felt more like a fairy tale. Both are excellent movies in their own right. I'm always surprised what you're able to ring a good story out of. This was worth the wait. A very funny and enjoyable movie. I highly recommend it. I give this movie a B."
48,The Disaster Artist,10,7 January 2018,One of the best comedies I've seen in my entire life.,"From the beginning to the post-credit scene I laughed. It is a demonstration that a comedy does not need to make vulgar or eschatological jokes. The work of James Franco as director to adapt the film ""The Room"" so well was impressive, and as an actor: he broke it, his best performance and how well he acted as Tommy Wiseau, from the bodily postures, his voice and expressions, a enormous work that deserves a great recognition and together with Dave Franco brilliant both, with a chemistry that crossed the screen. Many great actors and surprises that I loved, funny scenes, an incredible photography, I really liked the use of songs from those years. This film is brilliant and enters the top of my favorites of the year 2017, a great surprise and great original movie with a very good script. Great favorite to all the important awards this year."
49,The Disaster Artist,10,7 January 2018,cringy-fun epitome,"The fact this movie is based on a true story was for me the main point to keep watching it. The amount of times i gasped thinking ""i cant believe this happened one day"" was endless and made it very entertaining. I believe James Franco finally found the perfect fitting weirdness he was looking for in previous movies."
50,The Disaster Artist,10,7 January 2018,is it James or Tommy,"The disaster artist was one of the best comedies I've ever seen in my life (or maybe 2017). The movies was so funny that I was laughing out loud with all the people that were sitting in the cinema hall. James Franco did such a great job playing Tommy that I though that it was Wiseau I'm watching not Franco. 
The jokes in the movie were just on point and I didn't feel that they were neither lame or 'too much'. Also, I think, that before watching the disaster artist you should watch The Room because all jokes will appear funnier to you. I am happy to finally got to know the story behind making The Room. 
I must say that I expect James to get an nominee for an Academy Award because playing Tommy Wiseau is in my opinion a 'big thing'. He not only imitated Tommy's accent perfectly, but also the was he walks and his mimics. 
Well, after all I am just in owe for a comedy to be as good as The Disaster Artist. 10/10"
51,The Disaster Artist,9,7 January 2018,Franco-file...,"This is a great story to tell, Room must be one of the worst movies ever made, but one of the most entertaining...in that sense. Franco had a splendid idea to bring to us the making-of the Room in this nicely done movie. The runtime is short and this is actually good, cause you don't need to go deeper into this. The focus is on the character of Tommy (James Franco) and his relationship with Greg (Dave Franco) and how they get into making the Room.
It is worth to mention that the chemistry between the Franco brothers is impressive.
But the overall meaning of this gig is much more than presenting the making of a very (very) bad movie. It has something to say on the industry itself."
52,The Disaster Artist,9,7 January 2018,Follow your dream...,"The Disaster Artist is one of 2017's best pictures. It's an insightful tribute to outsider filmmaking and a genuine chronicle of friendship and artistic struggle. At the center is James Franco, who brilliantly captures the outlandish and ambitious spirit of Tommy Wiseau. It's not easy to get your name out there, to please an audience, and to work with a group of people who don't believe in your vision, and this film explores these conflicts and encourages you to follow your dream. It could've dived deeper into Sestero's memoirs, but that's really scraping the bottom of the barrel. The focus is where it should be and it's fascinating nonetheless."
53,The Disaster Artist,6,6 January 2018,"A Great Imitation, But Not Much Else",Http://nickkaminskysblogspot.blogspot.com/2017/12/review-disaster-artist.html
54,The Disaster Artist,8,6 January 2018,These Are the Thoughts I Took Out of My Pocket,"I took some notes while watching this movie, but fittingly they are borderline indecipherable. Still, I will say that this strange Hollywood ""success"" story is hilarious, forlorn, fascinating, and odd. Franco is completely unrecognizable in front of the camera, and does a good job behind it as well...even if it's not always clear how respectful or mean-spirited the movie is being."
55,The Disaster Artist,10,5 January 2018,Trying is never a bad thing despite the result.,"Making a movie about arguably the worst movie of all time is a huge risk,but James Franco find a way to make it work.
Instead of making fun of Tommy,which is already done by a lot of people,James showcase the heart behind making that movie,which is the friendship between Tommy and Greg,and how they both pushed each other to the limit.
This movie also has a strong message,and that is despite the result whether its negative or positive,at least you have to try.
kudos to the Franco brothers for their amazing chemistry in this film,I mean how ironic that James best film as a Director with his own brother.
In the end The Disaster Artist is a must see movie."
56,The Disaster Artist,10,5 January 2018,hilarious while at the same time being emotionally touching and insightful,"The Room has been an inside joke among me and, at this point, millions of others for years now, and I have relished gleefully in the momentous amount of popularity that movie has received recently, leading to the making of THIS movie, an adaptation of Greg Sestero's making-of memoir, a book I still desperately want to get my hands on! The Disaster Artist is a magnificent movie in its own right, and it tells a story of universal human truths, which I know sounds a bit over the top (probably because it is). The film made me laugh and cry, and touched me so deeply largely because of how relatable it is to anyone who, like me, is artistically ambitious and has actually, in one way or another, worked on film production, whether it be professional or otherwise. All across the board, the acting is great, particularly James Franco who stars as the now famous mystery movie maker Tommy Wiseau, a man who is mocked by ththe film, but also deeply understood. We see his obnoxious, idiotic side as well as his more tender and relateable side. 2017 has been a great year for movies about complicated characters that are deeply flawed, but are also portrayed with a deep understanding (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is even better than The Disaster Artist, or damn near any other movie for that matter), and The Disaster Artist is no exception. If you want to be emotionally engaged by something, regardless of whether or not you have seen The Room and will get every inside joke, The Disaster Artist is not the worst place to visit."
57,The Disaster Artist,10,4 January 2018,The Disaster Artist Review,"The Disaster Artist is a film directed by James Franco. I had heard about this film some 3 months ago while browsing a random website of upcoming 2017 films. Then a trailer of the film came, which impressed me a lot. I decided not to see 'The Room' just not to build up any kind of expectations. And after seeing this, I can say that this is just perfection.Plot: Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero decide on making thier own movie after not being able to prove themselves in Hollywood.Story and direction: In the beginning we get interviews from various celebrities quoting that how Tommy Wiseau tried to create a different kind of cinema and people happen to still remember this film because of how silly and bad its supposed to be. Then we shift to San Francisco, where we are introduced to Greg who struggles because of having stage fright and Tommy who in the very same scene acts quite horrendously and still has no shame in doing it in front of 15-20 people. Then begins the journey of these 2 people to destination Hollywood. Then we get to see their love for cinema and them deciding to go to Hollywood to make it big there. Then we also see concerns of Greg's mother as to who is this Tommy person and all her other worries. This all comes from great writing. Kudos to the writing team (Scott Neustader and Micheal Weber, who happened to write also 'The Fault in Our Stars' another of my favorite film). James Franco as a director too has done a fantastic job showing us not only the Hollywood struggle but also the precision with which 'The Room' was made. I felt an instant connection to the characters. At the end of the film we see scenes from 'The Room' are then compared side-by-side with reenactments of the scenes performed by the film's cast. Those scenes felt like it was the scenes of 'The Room'. An exact replica!!!! Performances: James Franco hit it instantly as Tommy Wiseau. His accent and body language were perfect. Dave Franco also was excellent. I didn't expect a fabulous performance from him. The role of Seth Rogen was quite mininal but its always a joy to see him. Allison Brie was also good as Greg's girlfriend. Ari Graynor was also good as Lisa. It's always a treat to watch Bob Odenkirk and Bryan Cranston!!!Favorite Scene: It would be where Greg along with Lisa and Claudette discuss as how difficult it is for Claudette to come everyday to set to perform considering her age. And she replies that we are actors and even a bad day on set is a good day. Also one other member in the same scenes deduces that 'The Room' might be semi-autobiographical. This scene showed the behind the camera tensions and worries of the cast which I liked about the scene.Verdict: This film ticked out all the boxes for me. I see many nominations for this film in many categories and do hope it wins. Even if you haven't seen 'The Room', it's no problem. You will still enjoy it. It has elements of comedy, but drama is too present in this film. Please give it a go. I assure you, it will be a blast.I am going with a 10/10."
58,The Disaster Artist,9,3 January 2018,I had heard that someone was making a third remake of . . .,". . . A STAR IS BORN, and I think that it is a stroke of genius for director\star James Franco to dispense with the shop-worn Janet Gaynor\Julie Garland\Barbra Streisand title and opt in favor of the less ironic and more apt heading for his project, which also uses the device of ingenious gender-neutral casting: THE DISASTER ARTIST. Among other winning moves on Franco's part is dragging this tired tale out of its ruts into Our 21st Century by adding to the usual STAR IS BORN-type yarn Gay undercurrents, themes of sexual harassment, and cutting-edge insights slicing through the idiocy of America's Monied Class. The latter point makes it clear why the USA's People's Studio--Warner Bros.--successfully bid to distribute THE DISASTER ARTIST. So far no one has produced a script which more accurately epitomizes the so-called Administration of current U.S. Strongman Vlad Putin. All it would take to convert THE DISASTER ARTIST into something perfectly analogous to our present-day Real Life Travails is stirring in a few thousand irrational Tweets to the stew of ""Tommy's"" madness. But when you really think about it, wouldn't you prefer to have DISASTER ARTIST Mr. Wiseau's finger on America's ""Nuclear Button"" then the tiny digits hovering over it now?"
59,The Disaster Artist,,3 January 2018,A remake of the making of a bad film,"This film tells the story of an aspiring actor who meets a mysterious man in an acting class. The mysterious man decides to take the actor under his wings, and they make a film together.The story is about the circumstances around the making of a film called ""The Room"". The film is portrayed to be very bad, to the point that it becomes good. James Franco is captivating as a man with an indeterminate accent. Dave Franco is convincing as a nice babyface. It is also pleasing to see the vast number of famous faces in the cast and cameo.I have not heard of the film ""The Room"", so I kept wondering why there is a film about the making of it. Perhaps Tommy Wiseau paid for the production of this film as well? Or James Franco is a friend of Tommy WIseau? To me, there was a lot of mystery. Then, the film explains that ""The Room"" has become a cult favourite, and it all becomes clear. And wow, ""The Room"" will even be released theatrically in Hong Kong later this month!"
60,The Disaster Artist,10,2 January 2018,Masterpiece of a Disaster,"""I did not hit her, it's not true! It's bullshit! I did not hit her! I did *not.* Oh hi, Mark."" ...everyone, now.Two things I knew before I saw this movie: #1 I would LOVE this movie. And #2: James Franco BETTER win Best Actor. At least, as of January 2, 2018, I'm right about the first premonition.I first saw The Room back on 2/13/11 when I requested the best worst movie, or one of my favorite types of films: the most unintentionally hilarious movies made. Kevin Carr of Fat Guys at the Movies fame led me to this ""film."" I was so grateful! This was the masterpiece of disaster films. I laughed so hard, I was in absolute tears.Since then, I've sought out other really bad films that tried to be the real deal, like Birdemic: Shock and Terror, Troll 2 and Battlefield Earth. None, absolutely NONE, could come close to The Room. When I heard they were making the making of The Room...I was fully onboard. Little did I know: They would NAIL it perfectly.While nearly 100% credit should be given to (James) Franco (as there is another Franco here,) the cast and extras were nearly as perfect. This is a movie based on quite literally the worst movie ever made. The backstory, character development and the absolute humor for people, like me, who's seen the final project was absolutely spot-on. And in the closing credits, they even prove how they got this true story pitch perfect.I have not clapped in the closing credits to a movie in a very long time. I did here. I was overblown on how this fit all of my expectations and more than made me laugh, cry and cheer throughout. Hell, it even made me feel sorry for Johnny...sorry, I mean Tommy Wiseau. Really, you gotta feel for the guy.Word of advice: SEE THE ROOM. You must see that train wreck of a feature. Then, YouTube all the reviews of it. Watch every one of them. And when you're finished, return to this film and know it's all true. All heartbreaking scenes and enormous laughter. You heart will soar with how a bad production turns into an absolute masterpiece of disasters.James Franco DESERVES Best Actor at the Oscars in 2018. He was so spot-on, it was uncanny. And even though it would be a spoiler, the real Tommy Wiseau should introduce the 5 nominated Best actors leading up to James Franco winning. I saw his performance in the trailers, and was already sold with his portrayal in the feature. Again, heed my recommendation: watch The Room, the YouTube reviews and then, this. You will know this ""true story"" is finally a real ""true story.""***Final thoughts: I've listened to a Bad-Movie podcast for years now called: How Did This Get Made? It's a hilarious romp on (mostly) bad films. Years ago, they reviewed this movie and now, the three main hosts, Paul Scheer, June Diane Raphael and Jason Mantzoukas, actually star in this movie. Which is so cool. Them, plus the many more cameos/friends of theirs and the actual stars, made this super awesome for me. And as an extra Final Thoughts bonus, here is my original 02/13/11 review of The Room, the one and only time I've seen the actual movie. Despite my obsession with the reviews of this on YouTube, I cannot bring myself to rewatch the disaster this came to be. Cheers!No Room AvailableNo, no, no, no, no, no, NO! The Room is not a black comedy as arrogant writer, star, distributor, producer and obviously blind director, Tommy Wiseau would want you to believe. Heck, it doesn't even have a single black person, much less anything but unintentional humor.Could The Room be absolutely the worst movie ever made in a World that gave us: Manos: The Hands of Fate? Eegah? Troll 2? Sharp Teeth? Shark Attack in the Mediterranean? Another Gay Sequel: Gays Gone Wild? A Sound of Thunder? Furry Vengeance? Boat Trip? Basic Instinct 2? Good Luck Chuck? Piranha Part Two: The Spawning? Glitter? Remember Me? Stan Helsing? Leonard: Part 6? Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation? All About Steve? Deathbed: The Bed That Eats? Pieces? Paranormal Activity? The Raspberry Reich? Curtains? Axe? Superman IV: The Quest for Peace? Batman & Robin? The Twilight series? Vampires Suck? Any Howling Sequel? Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines? Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan? Jennifer's Body? Plan 9 From Outer Space? 88 Minutes? Beyond a Reasonable Doubt? Lucky You? Jaws: The Revenge? 2012? Empire of the Ants? The Food of the Gods? Jurassic Park III? Halloween III: Season of the Witch? Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers? Halloween: Resurrection? Grown Ups? Year One? The Toxic Avenger? Either I Spit On Your Grave(s)? Blood Beach? The Last Airbender? The Happening? Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare? TV's Viva Laughlin? Saddam Hussein? Paris Hilton? Keanu Reeves? (Okay, those last four weren't movies, but damn you, World, for those.)Well, I had to ask myself: Is this really a movie? Is this a joke and I got the wrong ""film"" that people are talking about?Believe it or not, I had to consult with a professional critic and he actually confirmed that this is, in fact, a movie. And that he's seen it. And then I heard a gunshot and a loud thud. His poor, poor children.While he didn't actually die, you'll want to roughly 10 seconds into The Room. Die laughing, perhaps, at its amazing lack of direction and incredibly, there are two men fighting over the director credit: Wiseau (huh. WISEau?) and Sandy Schklair. Hmmm. Would you have fought with Pilate when he claimed to be the murderer of Jesus?In a ""movie"" (from here on out, that word will be very loosely associated with The Room) that even the dialogue sounds like it was dubbed √† la Rumble in the Bronx, even though everyone's speaking English - if you can call it that, you'll quickly learn what NOT to do. Such as the ever so comical ""shots"" of San Francisco and the unfortunate Golden Gate Bridge which probably would've asked for a cut if this made more than a tenth of a penny.Recently I re-watched and reviewed the brilliant The Big Lebowski, and I stated towards the end that it should be actually studied in film school, if not already. I'll say the same here, but obviously at the other end of the spectrum.You almost feel sorry for the labeled ""director"" Wiseau, if not for his arrogance - SEE: poster for proof. Ironically, his follow-up was Homeless in America, and if America did have anything to do with it, he would be. But can you really be mad at the guy for this atrocity? Well, if he stayed in the background, and not in more than 75% of screen-time, you might feel some pity.And his writing? It's as if he was a stone-cold foreigner who watched a lot of American Sitcoms of the 1950s and used an English Translating Dictionary to produce the words spoken on screen. Sure, it's hilarious to hear him, or any of them speak, but it's also sad when someone who apparently isn't familiar with the language, culture or modest enough to hire someone to even take a 30-second peek at the screenplay. Personally, I wouldn't jump over to Paris and write a movie on the life and times of the natives using both a French for Dummies guide and my memory of French class in High School nearly two decades back. Is Paris is Burning already taken? Oh.The ""movie"" follows a confused blonde (duh) named Lisa (Danielle) who unsure of her pending nuptials to Johnny (Wiseau.) Who would be when you're about to marry the love child of G√©rard Depardieu and Bob Dylan? So...she sleeps around and shows the camera she's not ashamed of her (probably bought) breasts. That's pretty much the plot. Throw in some laugh-out-loud 15-second subplot of a boy, Denny (Haldiman) who both likes to watch and do daaaangerous narcotics and a mother who looks as confused as George W. Bush without a speech to read. The actors, unbelievably, took this seriously. I would show more compassion for them, but even with a $1,000,000 scholarship to the New York Film Academy, they'd still fail later on. I've been told this is a great midnight movie experience, i.e. the astonishingly superior The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Perhaps. But, even at 99 minutes, it drags and my laughter nearly died, from pure exhaustion, towards the end. Fortunately, the SURPRISE! ending brought me back up to laughing hard.That all said, well...this entire review, I'd still recommend this ""movie."" How could you miss an opportunity like this? I seriously thought Troll 2 could never ever happen again. Improbably, lightning struck twice. First with a movie that's called Troll 2 that doesn't even involve trolls and now with The Room that's not even about one."
61,The Disaster Artist,6,2 January 2018,Stupidity immortalized,"I'm not really into the whole 'it's so bad it's good' thing, and am not one of the fans of the cult movie 'The Room' (2003), so I'm afraid this review is going to be counter to prevailing opinions. James Franco turns in a strong performance to be sure, and really does recreate the making of that awful film (as he's eager to show us in clips put side by side at the end), but I guess I have to wonder...why? I don't think the stupidity of Tommy Wiseau needed to be further immortalized. There are some very human moments - Franco saying 'you're the monster' to an audience who don't support his attempts at drama, and later him cringing at his premiere amidst the hooting and hollering of the crowd - but they are offset by everything else, which is just laughing at how idiotic this guy was. Regardless, I don't find the film (either the original or this 'documentary') all that funny, although Seth Rogen did rip off a few good lines. I admire Franco for the uniqueness of this film and for the tightness of his storytelling, but think he could apply his talents to far better things."
62,The Disaster Artist,8,2 January 2018,James Franco did a fantastic job.,"The Room, may actually be the worst movie ever made. It is so bad that it wrapped back around the rating scale and actually became, good? No, that can't be right...But somehow this movie now has ""cult classic"" status. This movie has a horrible plot, terrible script and even worse acting brought to you by the producer, director and actor Tommy Wiseau, who played the character Johnny. If you have not seen The Room yet, you probably should...even if you have to fast forward most of it. You definitely need to watch it in order to fully appreciate The Disaster Artist. James Franco's portrayal of Tommy Wiseau/Johnny was spot on, his accent and mannerisms had me amazed and many of the scenes in The Disaster Artist looked like they were plucked straight from The Room.James Franco fantastically portrayed Tommy Wiseau. It really is a testament to Franco's acting skills that at times I actually questioned if it was Wiseau or James Franco on the big screen. The imagined behind the scenes depictions of Wiseau as he goes through filming and ""acting"" was so believable. The end of The Disaster Artist actually had me questioning if it was a comedy, like I initially believed. It felt more like a tragedy near the end. And maybe that is how we know Franco did an amazing job: that we can go from completely mocking Wiseau and his terrible acting and screen writing in The Room - to watching The Disaster Artist and relating to Wiseau through James Franco's portrayal. James Franco might even deserve an Oscar for his performance."
63,The Disaster Artist,9,2 January 2018,Hand an Oscar to James Franco already,"The Disaster Artist is for me James Franco's wisest career move so far. The Room has been dubbed one of the most iconic cult classics of the 2000s and beyond, and it takes more than guts and demanding acting skills to pull off a biography movie about it. Yet James Franco, along with his brother Dave Franco, executed this task perfectly.The Disaster Artist comprises of all that you would crave to know after watching The Room: how director Tommy Wiseau ended up teaming with leading actor Greg Sestero; the juicy dramas on and off set; and most importantly, who is Tommy Wiseau exactly. This movie, a faithful adaptation of Greg Sestero's 2013 biographic novel, puts an end to all of these questions, while at the same recreating those memorable scenes off The Room. Having said that, the most memorable facet of The Disaster Artist goes to James Franco's jaw-droppingly accurate representation of the legendary Tommy Wiseau. In some scenes I barely recognized him and even thought Wiseau had just made a cameo. That's how good James was. Oscar-worthy to say the least.In short, if you are a big fan of The Room, just give The Disaster Artist a try. Or, just watch these two movies in a roll, and enjoy the ultimate fun trip."
64,The Disaster Artist,6,2 January 2018,Mostly funny semi-parody,"'The Disaster Artist' is a homage/satire of the making of 'The Room', one of the so-called ""worst movies ever"". Full disclosure: I've never seen 'The Room', as I'm not sure there's such a thing as ""so bad it's good""... It obviously made enough of an impact for James Franco, who decided to imitate his muse - Tommy Wiseau - by producing, starring in and directing this film. Franco didn't write it though - it's based on the book by Greg Sestero, Tommy's best friend, played by Franco's brother, Dave. One of the film's strong points is watching them onscreen together.There's an exceptional backing cast - Seth Rogen as a script editor, Alison Brie (Dave Fracno's actual wife), as Greg's girlfriend, Ari Graynor as the female co-star, Jacki Weaver, Zac Efron, Paul Scheer, Megan Mullally, Jason Mantzoukas, Hannibal Buress, Sharon Stone, Judd Apatow, Bob Odenkirk. But the film is really carried by the Franco brothers - at least one of them is in every scene. The main revelation is how much James Franco looks like Tommy and the final 5min show a shot-by-shot comparison of some scenes, and it's uncanny how close they got some of the diction and body language.This is basically a film about making a film - an actual behind-the-scenes documentary might have been just as good. Not a whole lot happens really, and you know how it's going to end. There's plenty of funny moments, but I feel like it might be funnier if you're familiar with 'The Room'. Bit disappointed they didn't actually resolve the mysteries of his age, place of birth & where his money comes from!"
65,The Disaster Artist,10,2 January 2018,Masterpiece,James Franco deserves an oscar for his performance in this hilarious masterpiece.
66,The Disaster Artist,8,2 January 2018,Well made and has a heart.,"On has to hand to the Franco brothers getting all those idiosyncratic details just right. The disaster artist plays like a crazy bromance movie with serious homoerotic undertones. The last mainly because, mystery man, Tommy's true motivations aren't really clear. Is he longing for friendship or is something deeper going on? In the end it really doesn't matter as friendship, the little guy versus the good old American Dream is full and center in the story. They could have made the characters really despicable but strangely enough they had certain warmth to them. If the story was handled with respect is hard to say as I haven't read the book but certainly the story and characters were handled with love and admiration. So what to make of it? Hard to say as The Disaster Artist is hard to separate from it's well known backstory. I was a bit disappointed that we didn't learn much more than was already out there. That being said I thoroughly enjoyed the movie nonetheless. I't no Ed Wood in a cinematic sense, but well made and has a heart."
67,The Disaster Artist,8,1 January 2018,Terrific film about a terrible film.,James Franco give a phenomenal performance in this dramedy which details the behind the scenes making of The Room.
68,The Disaster Artist,8,1 January 2018,Must see for fans of 'The Room',"Great film overall that celebrates 2003's 'The Room' as much as it makes fun of it. Dave Franco is good, but James Franco is so outrageously good as Tommy Wiseau I continuously forgot that I was indeed watching James Franco. He nails the mannerisms of Tommy so well - even the little laugh is just so beyond perfect.You don't have to have actually seen 'The Room' to enjoy this movie but it would go a long way - and the Disaster Artist is essential viewing for anyone who has.Loved the side by side scenes at the end as well - the attention to detail in this movie is just superb and there's a great supporting cast with some great cameos as well."
69,The Disaster Artist,9,1 January 2018,Funny and poignant,"What a great way to start the year. Funny and poignant, I would never see The Room in the same way again. The story behind one of the worst films surprisingly turned out to be an uplifting tale of success (?). James Franco is incredible as Tommy Wiseau. Recreating the scenes fromThe Room must have been really something and that post credit scene is gold."
70,The Disaster Artist,7,1 January 2018,A Bit Underwhelming....,"I was actually super keen to see this movie, like a lot of other people I'm sure.
But I feel like it was so underwhelming!
I was expecting so much more comedy to it! I'd probably classify it more as a Drama movie than anything else."
71,The Disaster Artist,9,1 January 2018,Very close to perfection,"'The Disaster Artist' is probably the closest I've ever come to giving a film a 10 out of 10 and not ended up doing so. It's so nearly perfect and only one thing in my opinion really holds it back which I will get to a little later. The positives however are plentiful. I should point out early on here too that I am yet to see 'The Room'. I've been meaning to for years because I know it is something every film lover simply has to do, but I also know I'm not particularly going to enjoy it because the whole ""so bad it's good"" thing doesn't apply to me in any way.So what makes this film so good? Well you have to start with James Franco's performance. It's bordering on flawless. In fact as far as performances based on real-life people go it may just be the best I've ever seen. How he got it down to such a fine art is beyond me. There are times (especially when he has his sunglasses on) where you will question whether they got the real Tommy Wiseau in for the scene. Impeccable acting.Secondly the script structure is a massive strength. Making a film about the making of a film can be a tricky thing to do, because getting the balance between characters and story can be nightmare. 'The Disaster Artist' will go down in a textbook as to how to do it for future film makers. The only negative I could really find in this movie was ironically Dave Franco's performance. I haven't quite decided whether he wasn't right for the role, or he was and he simply didn't get his performance right. Either way though it does have to be listed as a flaw in a near perfect film. Please see this film if you get a chance. It's too good to be missed."
72,The Disaster Artist,10,31 December 2017,Hilarious portrayal of epic filmmaker eccentricity,"The story of the making of the film ""The Room"" is brilliantly realized in this biopic directed by James Franco. It's the story of the making of the one of worst critically-received films in memory. Franco impeccably stars as Tommy Wiseau, the mysterious aspiring Hollywood star who in the late 90s, no one had ever heard of and almost everyone avoided once they saw him except, Greg Sestero, a young aspiring actor (Dave Franco who is wonderfully sympathetic) who meets Wiseau in San Francisco in 1998.The two realize early on that the odds are overwhelmingly against them in getting anyone in the industry to take them seriously or give them the time of day, so they embark on their own project to make their own movie with a script that Wiseau has written. Wiseau also directs the film, which turns out to be a unique experience for everyone involved.No other film this year made me laugh as hard as this one. It's beyond hilarious how peculiar and unconventional Wiseau's filmmaking style comes across. His oddities just jump out at you like no other, but in an endearing way. Despite its comedic aspect, this film never intends to ridicule or make fun of Wiseau but instead seeks to portray him as an artist who had nothing but an honest-to-goodness belief in the work he was doing and devout faith that it would be recognized. It's a story that is too poignant to pass up. Recommended to the highest degree."
73,The Disaster Artist,8,16 December 2017,Outsatnding,Went into the cinema after booking online and on the way in passed all the Star Bores fans clutching their tickets and mountains of popcorn and nachos and just settled myself down in a nice comfortable seat.The difference in my demeanor and those other fools was obvious on leaving...they had just suffered overacted bilge with no plot lines and awful direction...and I had done exactly the same...but mine was meant to be that.Never seen a movie where not much happened but with so much class...remarkable in it's honest simplicity..I was glued to the screen with a grin from ear to ear.Outstanding performances all round with everybody getting in on the joke.The last scene was a joy to behold.this is exactly the opposite of what the sheep in the foyer went to see and it stayed with me for days. Also..I think it's a shame that come Oscars time James Franco will be forgotten..as in my opinion this is the performance of the year.just goes to show that you don't need the Hollywood strange elite to make wonderful cinema.Give star bores a miss and get this on the big screen.
74,The Disaster Artist,8,16 December 2017,This Brilliant Satire will Make you Laugh and Cringe,"The Disaster Artist: Bringing Back the SatireThe Disaster Artist is about the making of ""the Citizen Kane of bad films,"" 'The Room.' It's also about its director, writer, star and producer, Tommy Wiseau. It's the most loving, hilarious tribute to an artistic misfit since Spinal Tap. The difference is, Wiseau is incredibly enough, not a fictional character. Star James Franco will tell you that the film is about the making of 'The Room', but every scene of the film is infused with Mr. Wiseau's essence. Franco embodies him fully. Franco calls upon his own challenges as a successful creative artist and twists it to show us how it would affect him if he had failed. Wiseau is as lovingly portrayed as this man ""from another planet,"" Tommy's planet, could be. Franco was the man to tell the story. Greg, Dave Franco (yes, James Franco's brother), is Wiseau's supportive best friend. I never fully understood why he stuck it out with Wiseau. But in the end, Greg saves Wiseau from complete despair. The rest of the cast is good. In fact, not even the underwhelming, one joke wonder Seth Rogen annoyed me in this one.The film follows Tommy's journey from obscurity to obscurity as he takes wrong turns. Even his good looking friend Greg can't get an audition in Los Angeles. Then Greg says, ""Let's make our own movie,"" as a joke. ""Yeah!"" says Tommy, and The Room is born. It's hard to imagine that 'The Room' was an attempt at serious film making. It plays that way in ""The Disaster Artist,"" however. Every directorial, acting, and script decision is off the mark. It's a master course in what not to do when making a film. Or is it genius satire? Not according to Franco's film. This tragic comedy is a small contained slice of life that doesn't try to me more than a hilarious and entertaining tribute. Rating: Pay Full Price
The film works and will make you laugh and cringe. Peace,

75,The Disaster Artist,7,16 December 2017,Surprisingly caring and reverant,"I was leery of going to THE DISASTER ARTIST as it is about the making of a notorious Hollywood bomb that has become a cult classic on College campuses across the country - not really my cup of tea - but when my college student child came home for Christmas break and asked if I wanted to see it with him, I thought ""what the heck..""And, I'm glad I did.Directed and starring James Franco, THE DISASTER ARTIST tells the story of Tommy Wiseau, a misguided and enthusiastic budding film actor and director who befriends another up-and-coming model/actor, Greg Sestero. Together the two seek to find fame and fortune in Hollywood. When that doesn't happen, Tommy comes up with the idea to make their own movie and the result is the Cult Classic bomb THE ROOM.With Franco and other ""comedy bro's"" friends of his like Seth Rogen, Paul Scheer, Jason Mantzoukas and Dave Franco, I was afraid that this was going to be a ""make fun of this guy"" type of movie and I couldn't have been more wrong. Director Franco takes a respectful approach to the people involved and the circumstances surrounding the making of the film. He approaches it, much like Tim Burton did in ED WOOD or Stephen Frears did with FLORENCE FOSTER JENKINS, Franco tells the tale of a ""quirky kook"" who has the wherewithal to drive their artistic dream despite long odds - and a lack of talent. Director Franco finds the fine line between making fun and having fun with the material and the oddballs involved.Dave Franco (James' brother) takes on the part of Greg Sistero - and he is our eyes into this world. I have turned a corner on Dave, as he is growing into a likeable actor that I was comfortable spending and hour and half living a life through his eyes. Joining the action - in extended cameos - are the comedians listed above as well as strong actors like Josh Hutcherson, Zac Efron, Merrit Weaver and Megan Mullaly - all acquit themselves well and are respectful of the material and the people involved.But the best acting in this film are two actor/comedians that - if gone unchecked - can get on my nerves. But, in this case, both were very strong and held in check just fine. Starting with Seth Rogan as one of the makers of the film. His character is amazed at the goings on around him, but is very willing to cash the paychecks. Director Franco gives us just enough Rogan to serve the film - and serve the actor - well.But it is Actor Franco that Director Franco works with the best. His portrayal of Tommy Wiseau is quirky and different, but always reverent and respectful of the man, showing a flawed and mysterious person who has a dream that will not die. This performance could have easily slipped into caricature (or over-performing), but Director Franco does not let Actor Franco do this and the performance is very close to the real Tommy (shown in side by side clips during the end credits) and could be a surprising Academy Award worthy performance (certainly a surprise to me). It was that strong of a performance.Do you need to see the original THE ROOM to enjoy this film? Not really. I haven't seen this film (but have seen clips and ""know of it""), Franco does a nice job of showing you just enough of the THE ROOM to make THE DISASTER ARTIST make sense.Much more than a ""let's look and laugh at this guy."" THE DISASTER ARTIST is a respectful, loving portrait of a quirky dreamer who never left go of his dreams.Letter Grade B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"
76,The Disaster Artist,,16 December 2017,Charming and feel good,"So the finished product is different than what I thought it would be when the project was first announced. Overall, it's a good film. A very good one at times. But it's also an incredibly safe one. It makes sense considering the novel it's based on, but the film was very, very kind to Tommy and Greg. It follows a very safe formula through and through, and sticks with it to the end. However, that's also probably a good thing. I was sure Franco would try something entirely crazy, but if he had, the film might not have been very good, let's be honest. Instead, the film sticks to the rulebook, sometimes being very funny throughout (although I honestly thought it would have been a lot funnier). Overall, it's decent, very enjoyable, and ultimately very light and feel good, which is sometimes all one needs. Franco did a great job. At first it seemed like a mere imitation, but he did try to go a little deeper to try to get at some core of the character. But the real star here is Dave Franco. He absolutely carries the film and gives it its beating heart and much needed grounded approach. He's incredibly charismatic, charming, and super likable. An underrated performance overshadowed by the showier one."
77,The Disaster Artist,10,15 December 2017,The Ed Wood of 2017,"""The Disaster Artist"" tells the true story of Greg Sestero (actor who played Mark in ""The Room,"" and co-wrote the book with Tom Bissell) as he is desperately wanting to be an actor, while he comes across a man who came from another world name Tommy Wiseau as they both became friends, and would go on to make the greatest bad movie of all time known as ""The Room."" I have seen ""The Room,"" which I thought was mind-blowing, and never thought anyone would make this bad, aside from Ed Wood who has been making bad movies. Even Uwe Boll, himself, makes bad movies based on video games. ""The Disaster Artist,"" has been receiving a lot of buzz, and I believe that James Franco, who not only deserves to be nominated, but deserves to win the Oscar for either Best Actor or Supporting Actor. Either way, he deserves to win one. He really capture did capture the spirit of Tommy Wiseau, who at times is crazy, but shows that he really is human. We really do feel for him, and we follow him along as he trying to make this movie. Dave Franco plays Greg Sestero, and seeing him alongside with James really do feel like that they are best friends, and not make things distracting that in real life they're brothers. Seth Rogen play Sandy Schklair, the script supervisor who claims himself that he was the director of ""The Room,"" and not Tommy Wiseau. He really is just like what audiences would pretty much point out of the flaws that Tommy is making, and he plays it really well too. The rest of the cast all did great. Franco's direction is really well done, and does know how to tell a good story, while getting invested with the characters. The cinematography is shot handheld, but it does give a sense of realism that it feels like real life, and while watching the movie, you feel like that were part of the behind the scenes of ""The Room."" The movie itself is not only funny, but definetly has a really good message when it comes to film making. I believe does go up there with ""Ed Wood,"" and both of those movies do share similar themes and messages. They both deal with friendship, and have a great message about making movies. Like ""Ed Wood,"" this movie should be shown to the scholars, and to those that are interest in the film making business. I won't spoil the movie for you, because I want you to see this movie and judge it on your own. If any of you are fans of ""The Room,"" then you are going to love this movie. I had a fun time watching ""The Disaster Artist,"" and I am giving this movie a 10 out of 10."
78,The Disaster Artist,9,15 December 2017,"""You're tearing me apart, Lisa!"", ""I did not hit her"", ""I definately have breast cancer"" and more, brought to life on the big screen","This movie is amazing. I just want to state that as a blanket statement that is movie, much as Tim Burton's Ed Wood that I also love, sends up terrible filmmaking but also manages to get to the person underneath those terrible movies.Obviously, whilst Ed Wood was based on Ed Wood's life of making many films, such as Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster building up to Plan 9 from Outer Space, and it makes it specifically it clear that this was a work of passion that was worked hard to make happen, this movie is based solely on the making of The Room - and casts a very different kind of persona at the centre of it.The screenplay - whilst it doesn't include everything from Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell's award winning book of the same name, and couldn't since there's so much content in that book it would take a 6 episode mini-series to cover all of it - does very articulately communicate how chaotic the behinds-the-scenes of the movie was, and keep humour going even when it borders into actual, genuine danger for the cast and crew. It also makes it clear, although it doesn't border the point on - which is good filmmaking, as it allows you to craft your own thoughts - is that in comparison to Ed Wood, who put his entire lifeforce into making his so called disasterpieces, the same can't be said for Wiseau, as at every step and turn he just pays for everything because he's so rich and can afford it, and his ultimate fame is ultimately anything but hard work. In order to balance that with a funny, engaging, rewatchable film is quite an achievement, which it more than manages.The best things about this movie BY FAR is the performances, particularly from James Franco, who has a massive challenge in trying to bring to life a guy who is not only as much of a cartoon as you can imagine, but also that no-one actually knows anything about - Tommy Wiseau isn't even his real name - and brings the person to the forefront. In one particular scene, where Tommy is completely naked and yelling at everyone for everything you could imagine, it runs the gambit of funny, terrifying, douchey, vulnerable, terrifying, back to funny again, and really helps make this one of Franco's strongest performances alongside 127 Hours, Spring Breakers and Milk.Dave Franco and Seth Rogen also help the film keep it's tone. Rogen does great at doing what he does best - speak for the audience it seems, in the moment. Sandy, as the script supervisor, is someone who gets the best arguments with Wiseau as the most experienced filmmaker on the crew, who will mention things the audience will see and think, like 'Why's he having sex with her belly button?' or pull up the infamous laugh in Mark's domestic abuse story. He is kind of underused a bit, as is most of the cast, but with a cast that big, it is likely to happen; pretty much, it's the case of the cast is spread a mile wide but an inch deep, although all of them do get a chance to shine for a moment.Dave Franco does a solid job here; he is very much the POV character here, as the movie is framed kind of like how Foxcatcher frames John Du Pont, or The Last King of Scotland frames Idi Amin, like this this Wiseau. When we watch Greg through this movie, we do get a fully realised sense of why these two would be friends, and why after everything they'd still be doing all this stuff for each other. Greg also gets a lot of compelling scenes with Tommy, the other cast, his girlfriend Amber (played by Dave Franco's wife Allison Brie), and the best cameo in a movie full of cameos, Bryan Cranston as himself.I really enjoyed this movie; there are issues, but they don't ruin the whole movie but just detract a little bit, whether that be pacing, or falling too much into a biopic trope (namely the Greg and Tommy fight near the end), and certainly don't make the film any less funny or rewatchable."
79,The Disaster Artist,8,14 December 2017,The Disaster Artist: Story of a bad film that becomes a phenomenon,"Independent comedy, a film based on a true story about the making of 'The Room', a bad film made in 2003, a totally incompetent film, in fact the worst film ever made. Starring James and Dave Franco as Tommy and Greg. Tommy is a larger than life character, he has an indistinguishable accent, unknown origin, unknown age and with a seemingly bottomless pit of money. He meets Greg at drama class, and we follow their journey into the LA film industry.The Disaster Artist is a human story about the pursuit of a dream. Tommy took risks when he decided to make 'The Room' his own way and fans respect him for doing that. A film for both devoted fans and also anyone unfamiliar with the origin film."
80,The Disaster Artist,9,14 December 2017,Makes you want to see The Room again,"Eccentric filmmaker Tommy Wiseau and his best friend, actor Greg Sestero move to L.A. and try to live the Hollywood dream by making their very own feature film, but end up embarking on a wildly unpredictable and unforgettable production. This leads to one of the most infamous, bizarre, and beloved midnight movies of all time, The Room........The Room is an unmitigated disaster on all accounts, and here, in the U.K, it's very hard to find this film. It's currently unavailable on any form of hard media, and it's never had a theatrical release, albeit for the odd midnight screening at novelty cinemas.So apart from the films legacy, you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who would appreciate the presence of Franco playing Wiseau down to a tee.But this is from Sestros point of view, and as much as Franco mark 2 excels as the wannabe star, it was always inevitable that James was always going to be the reason to watch this.In front and behind of the camera, Franco mark 1 has ironically, made his masterpiece, not only does he portray Wiseau as a sociopathic, mythical, almost pantomime villain character, but he also gives him an uplifting, inspirational edge, especially during the first act where everything is a pipe dream.The second act is where the beast of Wiseau is revealed, powerful, sadistic, and borderline mentally unstable. This is where Franco is at his peak, because although he shows all these traits, Wiseau is nothing more than an innocent, trying to reach his goal, and although hi allegedly has a bank account 'like a bottomless pit', he keeps going and going, despite his erratic behaviour.Whatever people think of The Room, Wiseau went all out and chased his dream, and no matter how it turned out, he did it, the man actually did it, and now he's a pseudo-legend in the industry, and it's ironic that not only has he made one of the most ridiculed films of all time, the man will never make anything as memorable.That's food for thought.It's a brilliant piece, hilarious, uplifting, bittersweet, inspiring, and one of the best films of the year.Stay after the credits, for one of the best stingers of all time."
81,The Disaster Artist,7,13 December 2017,"Not Quite as Fun as Watching ""The Room"" Itself","""The Disaster Artist"" begins with some recognizable entertainers talking about Tommy Wiseau and his legendary cult classic terrible movie ""The Room"" and why such a bad movie is so beloved. The tone of that opening segment carries throughout the film. James Franco, who plays Wiseau with equal parts satire and sincerity, clearly admires the man even while acknowledging his flaws, and the whole movie feels like an inside joke in which the people in it are both laughing at and with Wiseau and his creation.It's probably not a great sign that the best parts of ""The Disaster Artist"" are those in which Franco and company recreate the making of ""The Room."" If you've seen it, then of course these scenes are hilarious, and the fun comes in seeing how right they get it. The rest of the film is about Wiseau and his relationship with Greg Sestero, played by Franco's brother Dave, and either because Franco isn't a good enough actor, or because Wiseau isn't as interesting a character as people want to think he is, I found these parts to be far less entertaining. I can't even imagine how ""The Disaster Artist"" would play for someone who hasn't seen ""The Room."" It's such a niche film. And while I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Disaster Artist"" and think it's a good film, it really just made me want to watch ""The Room"" again. I'm not sure which film should be more complimented by that statement. Grade: A-"
82,The Disaster Artist,9,13 December 2017,"Hilarious, even if you haven't seen the Room.","***TL;DR - Really funny film about a classic cult movie with great starring performance from James Franco, a killer script with a unique true story and still accessible for everyone who hasn't seen The Room (although it may be worth watching The Room beforehand, it isn't necessary at all). Only criticism is that it should be longer, because it's so funny. 9/10***It would be wrong to call The Disaster Artist a film about the creation of The Room, because it's so much more. It's a story about film-making, friendship and failure. Epic failure. It is about what happens when you follow your dreams regardless of those who doubt you, those who tell them that you're not good enough - but instead of proving the doubters wrong, you fail so badly that fourteen years later James Franco creates an Oscar-worthy film just so people can laugh at how badly you failed. Believe it or not, this is a true story about an actual film in 2003 (the biggest complaint from test audiences was that they thought The Room could not possibly exist). James Franco puts in the performance of a lifetime as the title character Tommy Wiseau. Any decent Hollywood actor can pull off an impersonation of someone like Tommy for a cheap laugh, but James Franco does better - he disappears into Wiseau so totally that even the parts of the film which don't directly deal with The Room or some aspect of Wiseau's background are really funny. People who haven't even heard of Tommy at the start can, by the end, understand his crazed psyche - it's not just one big Room in-joke. I'm glad he was nominated for a Golden Globe - he deserves it. Another aspect of the film which went above and beyond my expectations was the screenplay. The writers manage to strike a balance between references and homage to The Room and Tommy Wiseau, and accessible and funny original humour. One of the reasons why The Room has developed such a cult is because it is so quotable (from 'Oh hai Mark' to 'Anyway, how is your sex life?' and a million lines between). The writers aren't content with referencing these quotes to comedic effect, they create their own quotes which will, if you ask me, become iconic quotes in their own right. They also didn't restrict themselves to a comedy-of-errors style narrative, and one of my favourite aspects of the story was the friendship between Greg and Tommy (which is touching but not overblown), as well as some of the more serious themes of unfulfilled dreams and how ruthless the industry can be (Tommy ended up paying 6 million US Dollars in budget, partly because the industry took advantage of how naive he was).Overall, the acting was good, although it is difficult to act when you have a character who is as scene-stealing as Tommy Wiseau. I think the cast did an admirable job, especially Dave Franco, Seth Rogen and Zac Efron as Chris-R. The list of cameos goes on and on, and the smaller roles really helped breathe life into the movie. I felt the film was a bit short, and could have explored some of the topics it touched on in greater detail. The laughter at the end (in the premiere scene) was over-the-top and only really served to affirm what we already know: it's a bad film. I also felt there were a couple of unnecessary scenes which could have been exchanged for scenes which drove the plot forward or explored some of the more interesting and crazy aspects of The Room (for example, Johnny was originally going to be revealed as a Vampire).This film is hilarious, even if you haven't seen the Room. It brings a great cult movie into the mainstream by allowing there to be in-jokes for the Room crowd but also making the jokes aimed at non-Room fans funny for everyone. It is also a touching story about friendship and about how not everyone can achieve their dreams (although in Tommy's case this is because of a severe lack of talent more than anything else). It has brilliant acting, a laugh-out-loud script, a true story which you couldn't make up and celebrity cameos for days. It also has just the right amount of heart without becoming sappy. I would give it a 9/10 rating and I would recommend it to any film fan who doesn't already have it on their radar, especially fans of comedy. If you haven't already seen The Room, it may be worth watching it beforehand, but you'll still have a great time if you haven't (I went with a few of my friends who haven't seen The Room and they could not stop laughing). To quote Wiseau himself: ""Haha! What a story, Mark."""
83,The Disaster Artist,10,13 December 2017,A interesting look at an entertaining disaster,"A few people knew about the so bad it's good film known has The Room(2003), I found out about it after watching The Nostalgia Critics review. And also inspired friend and costar Greg Sestero to write a novel about the experience. They say truth is stranger than fiction and this movie is a prime example of that.
James Franco is quite spot on has Tommy Wiseau,, his performance makes you think he is Tommy Wiseau, he does it without going into silliness. Dave Franco is also great has Greg Sestero, who sees something special in Tommy, but during the making of The Room, starts to question is there a method to his madness or it's just madness. Seth Rogen is also good in his supporting role. Also well directed by James Franco."
84,The Disaster Artist,9,13 December 2017,A Great Tribute to a Bad Movie,"I remember being first exposed to 'The Room' via the Nostalgia Critic back around 2011 I believe. I remember how bad the story is and the acting of Tommy Wiseau. But after seeing it it did leave me with a laugh. The movie was so god awful that it was hilarious and it felt natural rather than those movies *coughcoughsharknadocoughcough* that are forcibly bad because it was trying so hard to be a bad film it has no enjoyment to it. Hearing this movie coming out, I was very interested to see what went behind the scenes and oh my god I feel like this was all really filmed! Mostly during the sets of the film. The acting is superb probably the best acting I've seen in a movie and I think Dave Franco did great as Greg Sestero and James Franco was brilliant as Tommy Wiseau, heck the make up for him was stunning work that I almost feel like I was seeing the real one, but I'll get to him in a minute. The scenes during the set, particularly around the 'sex scene' where he was arguing with the crew. It had that raw emotion and how the way Wiseau treats his crew without any respect, what a scumbag! I genuinely felt angry that he did that! That goes to show that James Franco is a great actor. Now onto Tommy Wiseau, I feel a bit mixed with his character. I know he was suppose to be a scumbag as he was in real life but how the way it was delivered made me think him more as a glorified a**hole. Like how he treated his best friend for not taking that big opportunity to be part of 'Malcom in the Middle' because he has his reasons which resulted breaking up with his girlfriend. How the way he treated his cast and crew by spying on them, firing them because of reasons and was being weird towards them and yet 'The Room' is considered as his masterpiece despite all the crap that went into it. Now I don't hate the film but I don't like the creator of it all and it just put me off about him. However after seeing this movie I am interested in reading the book that it was based on to see more of what had gone on during the set as I heard there was more to it than what the film portrayed. In the end the movie was very good. I love the acting including Seth Rogen, I thought he was really good too! The story was interesting to watch and you can feel for the characters throughout the film that it makes them believable, although the actual cast and crew are real in real life :P I recommend this movie whether you know what The Room is or not! It's that good!"
85,The Disaster Artist,8,12 December 2017,Franco disappears into his greatest performance as the mysterious Tommy Wiseau.,"The Disaster Artist is directed by James Franco and stars Dave Franco, James Franco, Seth Rogen, Paul Scheer, Alison Brie, Ari Graynor, Josh Hutcherson and Jacki Weaver.When Greg Sestero, an aspiring film actor, meets the weird and mysterious Tommy Wiseau in an acting class, they form a unique friendship and travel to Hollywood to make their dreams come true. (15 cert; 103 mins)Over a decade ago, something truly remarkable happened. The Room, one of the best worst movies ever, was released in a single theatre for two weeks. Not surprisingly, the reason The Room lasted two weeks in that theatre was because a ""young"" man; Tommy Wiseau, paid the theatre to keep it running. Surprisingly, his disasterpiece became a sensation and has garnered a huge cult status over the years. A few years ago, Greg Sestero (who played Mark in The Room) published a book - ""The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made"" - documenting his life and eventual meeting with Tommy, interweaved with stories from the set. Now that book has been adapted into, as Tommy would say, real Hollywood movie; The Disaster Artist.Having watched The Room and reading the book about its creation, I was incredibly excited to hear the news of a film being made, focusing on the relationship between the two friends. What sucked was when I realised I'd be travelling 12 miles out to see this film. Unfortunately, the UK has had a lack of screenings for The Disaster Artist, but I just had to see it, so I made the effort. It was worth it. The guys working on this film all have a great amount of respect for Tommy and his unstoppable drive to make it in Hollywood, and it shows. James Franco directs with subtlety and finesse but it's his portrayal of Tommy that struck a chord with me. He completely disappears into his performance, delivering an unforgettable act that absolutely nails the personality and sells the affect Tommy had on people. Dave Franco provides a likeable lead as Greg, who has the same dream as Tommy; to be a Hollywood star. Having two real-life brothers play two best friends was a great choice. The Franco's have a brotherly bond that excels further on-screen and they both make The Disaster Artist a believable (as unbelievable as it is) and compelling drama.The film really focuses on the two aforementioned, but the surrounding cast is just as brilliant. Seth Rogen, Paul Scheer, Alison Brie, Josh Hutcherson, Ari Graynor, Jacki Weaver and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention are important to the story and bring greatness to the set within the set. The same goes for the crew who have worked incredibly hard to tell this story right. To respect these talented folk properly, stay through the credits because there are some insanely good side-by-side scene recreations. It wouldn't surprise me if they shot these on both digital and 35mm like Tommy did with The Room, that's how painfully accurate they are.Dave Porter's original score is surprisingly very present in the film, which for comedies is somewhat unheard of. Due to its dramatic nature, though, The Disaster Artist required something a little more memorable. Porter presents an inspiring and uplifting score that captures the tone perfectly right up into the credits.In terms of story, The Disaster Artist is fairly faithful to the source material. There are some moments overlooked, such as Tommy's awful behaviour and attitude on-set (though they do show some of this briefly), his suicidal period leading to his disappearance, and even the original casting of Mark. I was somewhat disappointed but then I realised what I was watching was real enough that it didn't subtract from any of my enjoyment. Greg's intricate explanation and description of these events are definitely worth reading, though, so I recommend buying his book right away. What I did like about this film was how Franco decides to add emphasis to Tommy's dream and create a sort of likeable charm that pays off during the premiere/auditorium scene in the final act. It was one of the best moments in the film and it really hits you. The Room is Tommy's baby. It's his life. I liked Franco's direction to respect that.Verdict; Though respectful, Franco isn't afraid to show the darkness looming over Tommy Wiseau, as he disappears into his greatest performance yet. This may well be one of the best biopics I've seen; a truly remarkable story.The Disaster Artist, 8/10."
86,The Disaster Artist,8,12 December 2017,Well done look at the origin of how a cult classic came about.,"I have seen many movies yet have never watched ""The Room"" over the coming months I plan to see it. As I've wondered what was always the fuss and as to why many art house and independent cinema chains have countless midnight showing of this film. So being one for film history and stories that involve origins, I decided to watch ""The Disaster Artist"" and I must say the work was well done as it gave me the viewer a better understanding of ""The Room"".Set sometime in 1998 it is the story of one Tommy Wiseau(in a fine turn from James Franco) who wants to become an actor so this apparent New Orleans native with a hard to call accent who claims to be in his 20's ventures out to Los Angeles for acting classes, and he meets and befriends a different style and kind of guy in Greg Sestero(Dave Franco)yet both have dreams of being well known actors. It's gonna be a challenge though with Tommy's long hair and heavy metal rocker looks. Yet with a bank account and the desire to set up his own studio and shoot scenes with his own cameras hope is present for Tommy and Greg.As the movie they plan to make is just one simple love story of passion and drama, yet Wiseau acts as his own independent style of a rebel and maverick on set as he calls the shots behind the camera and in front of it when he acts you feel like it's Hitchcock or Kubrick. Tommy did things his way. Still the actual film ""The Disaster Artist"" is blended with humor and pathos when it looks at the ups and downs of a guy striving for survival and the acceptance of humanity. Along the way many cameos are from well knowns like Jacki Weaver, Seth Rogen, Alison Brie, Sharon Stone, Bryan Cranston, Judd Apatow, and Melanie Griffith.Overall ""The Disaster Artist"" is a showcase film of desire and wanting acceptance to make something you want to feel belonging still the audience feels and sees the rage of one would be up and coming artist like Tommy who's own rules didn't apply it's like the world was against him. Still even though a mess Tommy did it his way proving it's okay to be different, it's meant to be different and everyone will be different. As with difference and being a disaster Tommy Wiseau will long be remembered and his work is a stepping stone for many underdogs and up and comers."
87,The Disaster Artist,9,11 December 2017,A *WONDERFUL* movie! No spoilers herein...,"EXCELLENT script, acting and directing all around, particularly regarding James Franco who unquestionably deserves awards for a genuinely incredible acting performance. It's actually a heartwarming dramedy that does NOT require viewers to watch the original ""The Room"" movie to thoroughly understand it. The film is quite an achievement, especially for a low-budget one based on a true story using a film-within-a-film structure. Kudos to the great Warner Bros. for picking up the international distribution rights. I STRONGLY recommend it."
88,The Disaster Artist,8,11 December 2017,A fascinating memoir,"Greg Sestero published his book, ""The Disaster Artist"" about three or four years ago, recounting his experience meeting and working with the human enigma that is Tommy Wiseau. What follows is the trainwreck of a production that later became 'The Room', known as the Citizen Kane of bad movies.In this adaptation of Sestero's memoir, with Dave Franco playing Sestero and his brother James playing Wiseau, it follows the bizarre journey Sestero takes after moving to Los Angeles in pursuit of becoming an actor. With producers and agents telling the duo that they have no future in Hollywood, they decide to make their own movie, prompting Wiseau to write The Room.The actual production is pretty chaotic and self-explanatory if you've either read the book or have seen The Room. But even if you haven't seen the movie, you kinda get the gist of it anyway.James Franco completely embodies the character of Tommy Wiseau; his impersonation and portrayal being pitch-perfect. Dave Franco's portrayal of Greg Sestero is also good, although he does come across as overly na√Øve. Seth Rogen is very funny as the script supervisor and the other supporting cast members and cameos are great also.While the general consensus would be that Wiseau is an overall grotesque individual, there is a great attempt of humanizing him through Franco's portrayal. You really see the development of an unlikely friendship between the pair and an idea behind how their production of infamy is still popular nearly 15 years later.Fans of The Room are going to love this and even the uninformed will enjoy it. Definitely has my recommendation."
89,The Disaster Artist,8,7 December 2017,A treat for fans and newcomers alike,"The Disaster Artist is a fairly ironic experience; one of 2017's most purely enjoyable films, based entirely around what could very well be the worst film ever made.For those that have thrown a spoon or two in honour of Tommy Wiseau's 2003 shocker The Room, a crime against cinema that has in turn become a cult favourite amongst cinema elite as well as casual cinema-goers, James Franco's newest passion project as director and star will be an absolute treat, while for newcomers to the bizarre universe of The Room, The Disaster Artist will act as a genuinely laugh out loud experience that acts as a fascinating look at the movie making process.Based on The Room co-star and Wiseau's best friend Greg Sestero's best-selling memoir of the same name, The Disaster Artist offers a captivating look at both the beginnings of Sestero's and Wiseau's budding friendship and collaborative partnership, as well as an hilarious, shocking and cringe-worthy look at how The Room was birthed into existence from the mind of Wiseau and how the multi-million dollar film was made.At the heart of this tale is a commanding and awards worthy turn from James Franco as Wiseau, who has with this production overcome a bizarre career patch of countless movies and so-so turns to remind us all once more of the talent that he possesses.For those familiar with the persona and mannerisms of the bizarre creature that is Tommy Wiseau, Franco's performance will quickly blend into a freakishly accurate and incredibly on-point inhabitation of the egomaniacal filmmaker and movie star.From the way in which Franco walks, talks, looks and of course laughs (Tommy getting his Ha Ha on is as creepy as you remember), Franco delivers what could well be his best performance to date and it's a turn that transcends imitation and becomes an actor at one with his character.Surrounded by a bunch of notable co-stars (as is the norm with a Franco production) like Seth Rogen, Alison Brie, Sharon Stone, Josh Hutcherson (winning the years worst movie haircut award) and a scene-stealing Zac Efron, all of whom have somewhat minor yet important roles, The Disaster Artist is a the type of event where you can tell everyone was having just as much fun making the film, as we are watching it.If there are criticisms of the film, they fall firstly at the feet of Franco's brother Dave who gets one of his biggest roles yet as Sestero but his not at the same level of his brother and it's hard to ever see the younger of the Franco brothers ever becoming a regular leading man, while The Disaster Artist as a whole is a fairly light on depth ride, there's not lasting substance to be found here, just a legitimately fun movie about the making of a terrible one, nothing more and nothing less.Final Say ¬ñ A film that will likely be a different experience for those that have watched The Room and those that haven't, The Disaster Artist is a film that will appeal to both portions of the viewers as one of the year's most enjoyable big releases, that offers an often fascinating insight into how one of the 21st century's biggest cultural phenomenon's came to be.4 surprisingly valid cheques out of 5"
90,The Disaster Artist,7,9 December 2017,Disaster Artist Makes Light of the Worst Movie Ever,"The fact that The Disaster Artist exists as a full-blown award season movie should be evidence enough that we're through the looking-glass when it comes to ironic/unironic appreciation for all things meta. The film is based on the making of The Room (2003), a noteworthy ""trash"" movie that's captured the imagination of many a film nerd with years of sold out midnight screenings and pot smoke filled, dorm room viewings. Centered on the friendship between Greg Sestero (D. Franco) and one man side-show Tommy Wiseau (J. Franco), The Disaster Artist recreates the atmosphere of chaos, ineptitude and bizarreness that plagued the production and inadvertently made the film such a cult hit.I first saw The Room under supposedly ideal conditions ¬ñ a viewing party of a few friends all of whom, like me, came in with fresh eyes. I¬Öwouldn't recommend it for those looking for a good movie (obviously), but if you're curious about grasping the appeal of trash cinema The Room is a surefire introduction into that world. For unlike something like Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) or Birdemic: Shock and Terror (2010), which are special-effects laden sci-fi films which cartoonishly under-deliver, The Room is pure, concentrated badness from pre-vis to post.On the other hand, The Disaster Artist, based on the novel of the same name by the real Greg Sestero, is a fairly polished, Hollywood biopic whose only real trick is it actively rouses Wiseau fans while selling itself to the masses as the anti-La La Land (2016). It's a neat little trick and it largely works thanks in part to James Franco's unhinged performance as the delusional Tommy.Yet for those giddy over the prospect of The Disaster Artist hitting the Award circuit with the energy of something like, say Ed Wood (1994) or Sunset Boulevard (1950); yeah, no. I'm afraid despite its subject matter being red meat to Academy voters; this film is far too modest in its approach and too bogged in the minutiae of the famed, plagued production to be anything more than a really, really good fan film.Which is kind of a shame; had the film truly delved into the darker side of Tommy's obsession, really reveled in the dark comedy, or at the very least made Greg's naivety a little more tethered to reality, The Disaster Artist could have edged out Swimming with Sharks (1994) in its nihilistic takedown of Hollywood. Instead it vies for a mercurial, funhouse mirror sense of irony where audiences don't know whether their laughing at/with the situation, the characters' reaction to the situation or the actors portraying characters that are inundated by the situation. It thinks it's being subversive but just like Tommy Wiseau himself it's mostly just hard to pin down.But regardless of whether we're laugh at or with The Disaster Artist, at least we're all laughing - you can thank all the seasoned comedic talents that pepper the film for that. Much has been said about James Franco's performance (which is great in a Best of SNL kind of way). But the comedic timing of Seth Rogen, Paul Scheer, Jason Mantzoukas and Zac Ephron not to mention the inclusion of Megan Mullally, Alison Brie, Hannibal Buress and Bob Odenkirk all keep the film entertaining and even charming in a sense. Also, not to get too insider baseball on you but Josh Hutcherson as Denny was a stroke of genius.So, what ends up happening when the usual suspects turn a niche inside joke into ""big Hollywood movie?"" Well, exactly what you'd expect I suppose. If the intention of The Disaster Artist was to be a cross between Boogie Nights (1997) and The Master (2012) (as James Franco had declared of the script) then I'm afraid to inform you it doesn't quite reach that level. But I suppose that's just another layer of comedic irony. For much like Tommy Wiseau himself, this film aimed for the moon and still ended up among the stars. Only time will tell if this film will have the same staying power¬ÖI doubt it."
91,The Disaster Artist,8,10 December 2017,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"I'm sure everybody remembers Tommy Wiseau's classic, laughable disastrous movie ""The Room."" After 14 years since it's 2003 release it has developed a cult following around the world, and while Tommy Wiseau was aiming for the movie serious and dramatic movie ever made, it ended up being the most laughable movie ever made, and yet so many people remember this movie more than last years Best Picture Oscar Winner. Here in ""The Disaster Artist"" it takes you deep inside who Tommy Wiseau really is and how he wanted the Hollywood dream. James Franco plays Tommy Wiseau, a man who is fearless and wants his fame, and Dave Franco plays Greg Sestero, a man who wants his Hollywood fame and thinks Tommy Wiseau is the best solution and thing that has ever happened to him. Together they finally agree to make a movie called ""The Room."" One by one, they get each actor/actress and crew member to become apart of the movie, and slowly we see how it all progresses. What makes this movie really great, and really inspiring is that while we can all agree Tommy Wiseau was too over confident and so over the top and dreaming too big, and how we can just shake our heads and laugh at him the film shows us the sad side to it which is that Tommy was a man who had a lot of heart and a lot of feelings and was really trying to make it, but nobody would give him the chance for they thought he was a loser and a nobody. The film touches on real facts on how hard it would be to get jobs and auditions in Hollywood. James Franco playing Tommy Wiseau was flawless. He was hilarious and he really knew how to touch your heart and makes you feel sorry for him. Dave Franco is another good performer here. He plays the part well by sticking with his buddy and trying not to ever let him down no matter what opportunity arises. The supporting cast are great, Seth Rogen and Jackie Weaver in particular. The direction by James Franco was really good as well. All in all it is a really funny movie, but the good thing about this film is that its heart is in the right place and knew when to make us feel for Tommy Wiseau. Highly recommended in my opinion.4/5 - Jayfilm lovers ourselves and audiences world wide, we know that there are bad films that exist among us, with The Room this particular film has a huge cult following for its bad value, performances, script and inconsistent tone. It's bad enough that we laugh at it, mock it and yet praise it's bad values. The Disaster Artist tells it's story of how it came to be and it results in plenty of laughs, great moments and a solid leading performance that adds to the list of this year's best performances.With a cast of recognizable actors and actresses including James Franco, Dave Franco, Seth Rogen and Alison Bre to name a few, the performances are all great throughout but it's James's performance as the oddly famous Tommy Wiseau that steals the film. From his behavior, style and even speech and acting range, it's quite a near pitch perfect role that seems like a blast.The script and pace is right on target, not a dull or heavy moment that drags the film and the overall direction (which is helmed by James Franco) is great that would be considered for award nominations, including his lead performance.Overall, TDA is a fascinating film that captures the essences of how a film can be so bad and how one dream can be hard to accomplish in life. Well worth seeing if you have seen The Room countless times or you are in for a film with a message about avoiding making a bad film and capturing a dream that's not as easy. 4/5 - Nick"
92,The Disaster Artist,10,10 December 2017,Possibly the Best Movie of 2017,"***Backstory*** I've watched the Room twice before, laughing while I've done it both times, and although I found it hard to watch the movie in one sitting I did quite enjoy it. When I heard James Franco was making a movie about the Room I ignored it thinking it must be a spoof. Although my early reactions weren't quite as hot, this immediately changed as the next two trailers came out. The next two trailers showcased this was not going to be a parody and instead an emotional and heartfelt look at what happened behind the scenes during the Room. I began to follow this movie, finding all the reviews I could as I learned this movie had already premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival and received a standing ovation. Although I began to anticipate this movie, I was still questioning whether or not to see it in the theaters as it was playing just a week before Star Wars and a few weeks after blockbusters like Justice League, Thor and Coco. I ***Flash Forward to 2 months later*** Heading to the theater I was still questioning my decision to skip Star Wars this year and watch The Disaster Artist instead. My previous theater going experiences weren't as well this year and I thought to myself ""If this movie is bad, I will literally lose all faith in cinema"". I anxiously waited for the trailers to end and the movie to start. Then the lights started to dim and the movie started, and I remember being blown away. This movie is breathtakingly good. Superbly good. Some scenes were really emotional and almost heartbreaking while others were really uplifting and deep. The movie starts at an acting class in San Francisco about 20 years ago and we are introduced to our main two characters Greg and Tommy. We see Tommy through the eyes of Greg, and although he appears to be a weirdo at first we later dive deep into his character. Greg and Tommy form a deep bond throughout the first 20-30 minutes of the movie and their bromance is somewhat... touching. There's an scene that sets the base of their friendship where Greg introduces Tommy to James Dean, who becomes an inspiring figure to Tommy, and Tommy insists that they go see James's crash site. At the site, Tommy and Greg making a pact to ""keep pushing each other forward"" and ""never give up"" and to confirm it, Tommy makes Greg pinky promise. Greg, although reluctant at first, agrees and the duo have a touching moment. Tommy asks Greg to move in with him in LA so that the two could give their acting careers a shot to which Greg immediately agrees. We see the two trying to make it in Hollywood being painfully rejected. Tommy, desperate to find a role as a hero going so far as to auditioning in front of a producer at a restaurant which doesn't end well and Greg, who can't even find a small role on a TV show. Tommy, obviously taken apart by this gets the idea from Greg to make his own movie. We watch Tommy write his own script for his masterpiece alias The Room. In the meantime Greg finds himself a girlfriend with whom he wants to move in with. When Tommy learns of this, he becomes heartbroken. Imagine having no chances, no friends and being rejected from your dreams all your life and then after having one friend, losing that one friend. That is Tommy at the moment. Nonetheless, the production of the Room starts and as most know it is haywire. Tommy constantly shows up late, directs in a funny manner and constantly yells at the other crew involved in the film which leads to the crew making jokes about him behind his back. In one integral scene of the movie, he goes so far as to body- shaming the lead actress in front of the whole crew and justifies it by exclaiming he knows what the crew says about him behind his back. Tommy even jeopardizes Greg's chance to be in another film or TV show apart from the movie which leads to him reaching his breaking point. Greg and Tommy ensue in a heartbreaking fight and don't talk to each other again for the next 2-3 years. Greg, who is now working at Broadway comes to know about the premiere for The Room and is shocked to know it is still a thing. Tommy locates Greg and forcefully invites him to come along just for the premier alone. Although Greg is reluctant at first he eventually agrees. Premiere night comes along as the Greg still questions his decision to come. As The Room starts, most of the audience is in dismay and questions what is the hell is this? As Room progresses most of the audience find The Room hilarious due to its atrocity. When Tommy is revealed to the audience's reaction, it is truly heartbreaking. Tommy cries and leaves the theater. Greg soon goes after Tommy as he sees him crying and consoles him. Greg takes him back to the theater proclaiming, ""Don't cry Tommy, they are only laughing because they love your movie"" as he rekindles their relationship and eventually cheers up Tommy. Tommy accepts this and thanks Greg. As Tommy races onstage to receive the round of applause Tommy thanks them, and invites Greg onstage exclaiming it is his best friend. So please do watch this excellent movie if you can rather than the CGI fueled mega-blockbusters coming out these days and treat yourself with a rich movie about art, film and above all friendship."
93,The Disaster Artist,7,9 December 2017,Good Comedy,"As a stand up comic myself, I was very pleased to see so many stand up comics in this film. They acted well. I've always wondered why so many stand ups of yesteryear (i.e.: George Carlin, Dennis Miller, Bob Saget, etc.) who were themselves onstage couldn't quite transfer that ability to screen acting well. I think that it's a rather easy transition after you've had your soul drained out of you onstage.Anyway, it was a pleasant element, as were the jokes in the script. James Franco is to be commended for acting poorly so well. Even his physical acting when his Tommy character was ""acting"" in his movie was absolutely horrible. Nailed it. It's probably difficult for an experienced, talented actor to discard everything that he knows about his craft for weeks at a time.If you're familiar with film making, you're going to laugh when you realize that Seth Rogen's SCRIPT SUPERVISOR character seems to be taking over the role of director as Tommy's incompetence is exposed.It also had surprisingly touching and sympathetic moments between Tommy and his closest friend near the end.There were a few lulls in which I wasn't laughing and getting somewhat bored, but overall I was impressed."
94,The Disaster Artist,10,6 December 2017,"My favourite movie of the year, so far!","Oh hi, IMDb user... how's your sex life? Sorry, I just couldn't resist. 'The Room' (2003), is, without a doubt, one of the worst films ever made. Tommy Wiseau (who wrote, directed, produced and starred in it), had a vision that nobody else could understand. A vision so unique, that it just did not make sense. We see aspiring young actor Greg Sestero (Dave Franco) struggling in acting class, feeling ridiculous and having no confidence to act in front of people, afraid that they will humiliate him. It is there that he meets a strange looking man with long black hair, odd fashion sense and an accent so bizarre, it sounds like a cross between American, French, and maybe Russian(?). That man is Tommy Wiseau (James Franco), who feels no shame in performing however he can in front of an audience, despite his over-acting and messing up the lines. These two seem to form an unlikely friendship. Greg admires Tommy's confidence and willing to go the extra mile to be a movie star. Tommy decides to take the time to teach Greg how to ""express himself"". They decide to head to Los Angeles to fully achieve their goals to become actors, but everywhere they go, they get rejections from all over. Greg meets a girl, and Tommy feels strongly about this, as he fears he could lose his only friend. After a plethora of rejections, Tommy and Greg come up with an idea that they should just make their own movie to prove what they have got. So Tommy gets writing, and comes up with... ""The Room"".This movie directed by James Franco - based on Greg Sestero's ""The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room"" - is mostly about friendship. I found myself caring for the close bond that Tommy and Greg have. It's heartwarming to see Tommy - who probably struggled to make friends throughout his life - find someone as caring as Greg, who looks out for this strange human being. James Franco does a great job making Tommy Wiseau seem sympathetic and down-to-earth. I actually found myself feeling sorry for him at one point... never thought I could, but wow!Dave Franco does a terrific job at playing the troubled actor, Greg. The guy that always has to help Tommy stand on his own two feet and support him, no matter what everyone else says. If you're an aspiring filmmaker, this is definitely the film for you. It reminds me a lot of Tim Burton's 'Ed Wood' (1994) and/or Disney's 'Saving Mr. Banks' (2013), about the somewhat troubled production behind some films. Tommy Wiseau is kind of an odd inspiration, but one thing you got to give to him... he was never afraid to give up. He did what he could, and in a way, he did achieve it. 'The Room' will always be an inspiration for bad movies, and after seeing James Franco's biopic, Wiseau should definitely look back and be proud of what he's done. Now, let's go eat, huh..."
95,The Disaster Artist,8,5 December 2017,"Great fun, but so much potential to have been a Kaufman-esque masterpiece","I love The Room (despite the weird nebula of disturbance it leaves in my mind afterwards) and Greg's book The Disaster Artist (many moments of which had me burst out in laughter). Having anticipated the movie so much, I couldn't help but smile all the way through - the performances are brilliant, and the little nods and references to various aspects of the film and book are great. Tommy is as amusingly accurate as can be (its never going to be 100% successful, Tommy is completely unique). Its so much better to watch with others who are aware of The Room - you can feel the difference in reactions from people in the theater as to who 'gets it' and who doesn't. I wanted Franco to push more of the randomly odd moments of the book but I can see that its a tough balancing act in terms of portraying his character. Franco does well to instead underscore the film with this sense of inner turmoil. In less sensitive hands Wiseau could easily become a cartoon target of mockery, but Franco gently invites you to consider his humanity, dreams and insecurities. This gives the film a much stronger backbone, especially when dovetailed with his relationship to Greg. But I couldn't help but find myself in that weird, murky and unsettling place again when exposed to 'Planet Tommy'. So there's as much tension as comedy - seeing the horrible conflict of encouragement/support vs honesty, opportunities vs loyalty, altruism vs expected reciprocation, tradition vs originality, believing in yourself vs listening to criticism (or, your own perception vs everyone else's). It was a VERY ambitious and tough film to pull off considering the overall complexity, but overall they did a great job. I would have LOVED the film to have gone even more meta to see more of the actors and filming of this film, intercut. E.g. the Francos talking about their discovery of The Room, seeing more outtakes of the actors laughing their heads of when trying to recreate scenes etc. If there had been scenes of James Franco writing bits of dialogue for the film, some rehearsals etc, trying to become Tommy, it could have become an insane masterpiece (sort of like Synecdoche New York crossed with Adaptation)."
96,The Disaster Artist,9,3 December 2017,It's ironic how this movie is so good as it celebrates a movie so bad.,"Just like what Tim Burton did for Ed Wood when he made a movie about the filmmaker's attempt to make what will become known as (until the Room) the worse picture ever conceived, Plan 9 From Outer Space, James Franco takes his love of what The Room is and became interested enough about the man (or rather men) behind it to want to make a movie about it.I've seen the Room, let me tell you, it does not seem that interesting. With acting so bad it makes the movie dry and bland to the point where you can't help but to laugh at how bizarre the whole thing is. When I saw it I did ask the question: ""How the hell did this get made""?James Franco gives us the answer (or as much of it as he can), as he directs himself as Tommy Wiseau and his bother Dave plays Greg Sestero in a inspiring story of a man with a lot of money who befriends a kindred spirit in a young actor, and they decide to lean on each other in order to follow the Hollywood dream, but when the dream becomes a nightmare they decide to go at it themselves by making a movie... that's a nightmare on it's on.If The Room did not have a big enough cult stasis I can already see it increasing thanks to The Disaster Artist. How ever famous it was before Franco's well crafted journey into a the mind of a man who stands on the edge of genus and instability, is about to make it Infamous. It was indeed a great role for Franco as both director and actor. With the support of all his friends through small parts and cameos like Zac Efron, Hannibal Buress, Josh Hutcherson and of course, his hetero life mate, Seth Rogen. ¬†I hear Oscar buzz in his future, which I get, his transformation into Wiseau is amazing, and if the academy can love a picture like LA LA Land than they should love The Disaster Artist, cause it's just such a pure story about two people who love the biz.http://cinemagardens.com/"
97,The Disaster Artist,8,3 December 2017,The Disaster Artist (2017),"The Disaster Artist I saw The Room a few years back and love it, to the point of obsession. No doubt, its absolutely terrible with a ton of flaws in production, acting, and script. Yet there is something endearing about it, that makes it ridiculously entertaining. I own the damn Bluray because I love it so much. Definitely my favorite ""so bad its good film."" When I heard about The Disaster Artist I was so infatuated with an adaptation of Greg Sestero's book. I loved all the trailers and was anticipating this for a while. Safe to say, The Disaster Artist is actually really good. Very entertaining, funny, and well acted.The film is an autobiographical take, focusing on the beginning of the friendship of Greg and Tommy Wiseau. Wiseau is definitely a mysterious figure and the two soon become friends because of their love for acting. Down out of luck in Hollywood, Wiseau decides to make his own film (with a mysterious fund for the film) and while the film production wasn't without turmoil, the end product turns out to be one of the worst films of all time. And yet, the film becomes a cult hit and a success despite being terrible.I think Franco's filmography is streaky to not very good (although admittedly I've only seen stuff here and there) but this most be his best work. Franco captures most of the embodiment of Tommy Wiseau and is so magnetic with his awkward mannerisms, ideas that don't make any sense, and his foreign accent. The film is very funny, you will get the humor and enjoy yourself even if you haven't seen The Room. However if you've seen it you will really appreciate what goes on in this film.The film has a few cameo appearances which are cool, stay tuned even after the credits. The film also boasts an incredibly catchy late 90' early 2000's soundtrack and the attention to detail of the recreation of scenes and sets of The Room is almost perfect. This film actually made me want to re-watch The Room and re-experience the wonders of unintended genius of Tommy Wiseau. Franco has done a wonderful job with this film, and even though its about the worst movie ever, the film about the making of it is rather fantastic.8/10"
98,The Disaster Artist,6,2 December 2017,The Room Goes Outside,"I give this movie a 6.7, for me personally there wasn't enough story or behind the scenes moments that made me feel like it was something special, although the acting does work and Franco does a great job as Tommy I was left feeling like I was watching a parody movie. Being that; my biggest problem was not James Franco's performance of Tommy but that Tommy wasn't playing Tommy, to me no one can play Tommy but Tommy. All those scenes that showed Tommy's life; I just kept thinking to myself wow I would just most rather see Tommy do it to see him live it! Otherwise there wasn't any real big surprises in the movie, and in the end I would have preferred to have read the book instead. When the primary movie is over they do a side by side of scenes from the Room and scenes they shot with actors portraying the scenes from the Room that were done to be exactly the same; and to me that's how the movie felt, I know its a biography style movie but when you are already familiar with the 'real' actors you get a kind of knock-off feel throughout. In the end this is probably one of those instances where people who have read the book (me not being one of them, but I am currently more interested in doing so) would probably say the book is better. There wasn't any serious arches in the movie but it was still enjoyable to see, but probably not as much fun as seeing the Room in theaters with a large crowd, it was basically an ad for the Room where I would have preferred seeing the Room in a sold out theater instead. The movie moves along though not to be entirely negative it keeps a calm straight line with the audience but for me it was definitely a watch it once and probably not again, I don't think it has much ""re-watchability"" and I ultimately was hoping for more back story or candid moments to come to light. 6.7."
99,The Disaster Artist,7,10 December 2017,Wiseau Serious,"If you are aware of the broader catalogue of James Franco's filmmaking decisions, you should appreciate him as the lead of ""The Disaster Artist."" As a director, Franco has made bold and ambitious decisions that would (or should) be considered senseless by even the best of filmmakers. Great stories like ""As I lay Dying"" by Faulkner, and ""Child of God"" by Cormac McCarthy make for absorbing and introspective reading, but are almost untranslatable to screen. Franco throws himself heedlessly and enthusiastically into these projects with every intention of honoring his adored authors. The results have stacked up to a litany of adaptations that are generously called pretentious, and more often considered self- serving passion projects by an ill- equipped visionary. One could see why Franco found a kindred spirit in the tragically inept creator of ""The Room"", Tommy Wiseau.""The Room"" is an un-spoilable movie. There isn't a coherent plot to ruin. It is infamous for all the reasons a filmmaker would hope their film wouldn't gain notoriety. Incomprehensible melodrama, atrocious acting, baffling editing, and otherworldly dialogue are all slapped together in a film that should be unwatchable. The reason it has gained a loyal cult following and become endearing is an unmistakable sincerity. Each frame shows a filmmaker hopelessly baring his soul while making every mistake in the book. Had this been a contemptuously produced project by a creator who truly didn't care, we might feel affronted for the gall. With Tommy, the audience may laugh at him for the duration, but they also ardently thank him for the experience. We can hardly conceive of a picture made with so little self-awareness and so much innocence. ""The Disaster Artist"", based on the book of the same name, is the first-hand account of ""The Room's"" creation by its 2nd lead, Greg Sestero.Greg (Dave Franco) is a 19-year-old dreamer from San Francisco in 1998. He struggles to utter syllables in his local acting classes and hopes to be part of the movies in some capacity, appropriately na√Øve for his age. It is there he meets the enigmatic and marvelously eccentric Tommy (James Franco). Greg overthinks every line in his rehearsals while Tommy fearlessly gives zero thought into every line he bellows. The sheer confidence of Tommy is attractive. Based on the reaction Tommy gives to Greg's attention, you'd think it was the first person that ever showed him interest. Tommy orders everything on the menu when they go out, and drives a $50,000 car with literally no backstory. When they toy with the idea of venturing to Hollywood to follow their dreams, Tommy reveals he already has a place, unused for months, in the heart of L.A. for no logical reason. Money is never an issue. It's as if Greg conceived an imaginary friend that came to life before he was finished thinking through the details. Once in Hollywood, the duo quickly find that wanting the dream isn't enough to gain traction in the cynical city. Months pass without the promise of work and still nothing comes to light to explain who or what the hell Tommy is. He maintains lies about his age and citizenship, making for hilarious moments where he thinks he's got everyone fooled. The depths of Tommy's pockets grow in scope when he decides to write, produce, and direct his own film having exhausted all other prospects. Acting in the lead role, of course.The production of ""The Room"" is the most entertaining act of the movie, but it's not its heart. We find that Tommy deals with challenges with less maturity than his teenage (now 23-year-old) co- star. The lovable qualities of Wiseau start to teeter when his childlike jealousy and frustrations mold him into a much less sympathetic character. I suppose it's all necessary so that we can feel justified in our glee of laughing ""at"" Tommy and not feeling too guilty about it. Supporting actors on the project like Seth Rogan, Aria Gaynor, Josh Hutcherson and Alison Brie get to make all the side comments during production that we all said to each other in the theater when first seeing the finished project.It may not be a high compliment to say that Franco is more suited to adapting a book based on ""The Citizen Kane of Bad Movies"" than Steinbeck, but he deserves something for the well-executed effort. Franco goes full method in his approach to portraying Wiseau, all while directing himself, directing himself, and treating the character with dignity. For those who can't appreciate the low- stakes juggling act, ""Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!"""
100,The Disaster Artist,,5 December 2017,"First see the Room, then Franco's brilliant docudrama about its making.","""The Citizen Kane of bad movies"" In front of the camera and behind it as director of The Disaster Artist, James Franco deserves the artistic praise his subject, Tommy Wiseau, would never receive. Wiseau produced, directed, wrote and starred in The Room, arguably the worst movie ever made.Because it's natural to be curious about the dedication and lack of talent it would take to make such a cult classic (packed at midnight in many art houses around the country), Franco has given his measure of dedication and talent to produce a first-rate biopic that sugarcoats not at all the zany set and principals producing such a risible work.Although Franco's imitation of Wiseau is sometimes too slavish, generally he catches his charmingly witless energy in the search of becoming a filmmaker. With the help of his best friend, Greg Sestero (Dave Franco), Franco and his brother make the making of The Room believable and affecting.Because, you see, although Tommy has no talent for artistic expression, he has a drive to be successful that transcends his limitations. Indeed, pursuing a dream, even while lacking the resources, is an end great in itself. Tommy is helped, coincidentally, by a mysterious fortune no one can ever trace. Yet, he uses it to fulfill his dream of being a filmmaker who creates a classic, albeit one that may be the worst ever made.He can be legitimately called the modern Ed Wood, a producer of schlock like Plan 9 from Outer Space, the reigning clunker until The Room arrived.""Why is he having sex with her bellybutton? He knows where her vagina is, right?"" Sandy Schklair (Seth Rogen)"
101,The Disaster Artist,1,11 January 2018,Horrible movie,"Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. You've been warned. James Franco is utterly annoying and unbearable in this movie. I don't get the joke. The film is proof that if you get a bunch of respected critics to like something, everyone else is guaranteed to agree like a lemming."
102,The Disaster Artist,8,28 December 2017,Stunning performance by Franco,I wasn't familiar with the story of The Room until reading about The Disaster Artist but still thoroughly enjoyed it. James Franco's performance as the bizarre enigmatic Tommy Wiseau is stunning. Highly recommend.
103,The Disaster Artist,7,21 December 2017,A Good Film About Making A Bad Film,"The Disaster Artist tells the true story of eccentric, wannabe filmmaker Tommy Wiseau's (James Franco) attempt to make his own professional movie, and of his relationship with young, wannabe actor Greg Sestero (Dave Franco). It's not at all a spoiler to say Wiseau was successful in that he did get his film, The Room, made and that it did experience a theatrical release (in one theater). The Room, (released in 2003), has achieved cult status since its release; now considered by many to be ""the best worst movie ever made"".The first question that should arise is, ""Can you really enjoy The Disaster Artist without first seeing The Room?"" The short answer is ""No"". The Room is a bad movie for sure. I personally didn't enjoy it as much as its many fans do because it's not quite bad enough to be hilarious, at least not for me. For me, it's just bad. (Though I did chuckle at it at some points throughout.) However, seeing it before watching TDA will help you appreciate a lot of what's going on behind the scenes in this film. That being said, if you absolutely can't suffer through The Room, then you can still find enjoyment in TDA, because, unlike the film it's based on, it is very good.TDA is the best film James Franco has been attached to in recent memory. He transforms himself into Tommy Wiseau. It's an excellent performance and one that deserves the praise it's getting because he disappears into it so well. Also, Wiseau is so odd that any imitation of him may have easily come across as parody. That seems to be the last thing on Franco's mind. Wiseau's lack of tact and inability to empathize with others could easily make him seem like an arrogant jerk. But he's portrayed here more as someone who's odd behavior is simply misunderstood; his abrasiveness stemming more from passion than from ego. It's a bit of a tight-rope walk for Franco. While we shouldn't necessarily like Wiseau, we at least need to be able to appreciate his motivations, and connect with a man pursuing his dreams-Franco does this very well. He does not do it alone though. In order to avoid just scoffing at Wiseau, we need a more grounded character to bridge a connection. James' brother, Dave Franco, plays Greg, an aspiring actor who is at first intrigued and fascinated by Wiseau, even accepting an invitation to move to LA with him so they can both pursue their dreams of becoming famous Hollywood stars. After last year's underrated Nerve, and this year's turn in TDA, Dave Franco is showing some solid potential beyond the immature young guy roles we're used to seeing him in. His performance obviously isn't as showy as his brother's, but that's exactly why it works. Someone needs to offset the wackiness and bring a balance to the film. While James is getting a lot of awards attention for his performance, I feel Dave should be in the best supporting actor conversations. It may be that he's simply in the film too much to be considered a ""supporting"" role. Either way, if he keeps digging into more roles like this, he could easily make a real impression on audiences beyond being ""James Franco's brother"".The rest of the cast is a real who's who of cameos and supporting turns. The film opens with several real-life actors and filmmakers sharing their opinions on The Room. Then as the film goes on, every time you turn around a popular actor shows up in just about every role. It's like everyone wanted to be a part of this film. Just to name a few: Seth Rogen, Paul Scheer, Ari Graynor, Alison Brie, Jacki Weaver, Josh Hutcherson, Zac Efron, Megan Mullally, Hannibal Buress, Jason Mantzoukas, Lauren Ash, Charlyne Yi. Even Melanie Griffith and Sharon Stone show up for small but effective parts.As for the film itself, if you're a fan of movies about making movies, like I am, you'll love TDA. Pulling double duty as both the star and director (it only makes sense considering who and what the film is about), James Franco creates a wide canvas for his characters to play on, beyond just watching a bunch of people making a movie. I'd argue that the first act could have been a little bit tighter, but the film never gets to where it's dragging or stalling. All the actors are given a chance to shine. The script is solid. On the technical side, from cinematography to music, nothing will over-impress, but its all serviceable and suits the material well. There is some appreciation for the technical crafts after the film ends when side-by-side footage is shown of The Room and precisely re-created scenes for TDA.The Disaster Artist probably won't crack my top ten list for this year, but I certainly enjoyed it and intend to see it again at some point, perhaps as a double feature with The Room. Other than being fully prepped for awards season, I can't say its a film that must be seen in theaters. It's small scale seems well-suited for home viewing. If you're a fan of The Room, or just want a glimpse into the world of making indie movies, or even if you're just a fan of the actors involved, The Disaster Artist should earn a spot on your watchlist. 7.5/10"
104,The Disaster Artist,6,17 December 2017,Hollow,"There was an odd buzz surrounding this film, that in my opinion was totally unmerited. It just scratches the surface of the story and embellishes some things. I'm someone who is not a fan of The Room because, well it's really bad. That being said I really wanted to see what Franco had to offer here as far as unpacking what the hell caused the debacle of a film. Really Disaster Artist was an empty look and borders on biography and parody. I found the end to be very very overdone and from what I know, entirely fabricated."
105,The Disaster Artist,8,10 December 2017,Hilarious Look at the Making of the Best Bad Movie of Hollywood History,"James Franco absolutely crushes it as Tommy Wiseau. He captures every single oddball idiosyncrasy the man has to offer, and Franco encapsulates it all perfectly. From the first second we are introduced to him, it is clear that Franco isn't just doing a Tommy Wiseau impression; he has completely become him. That was one of my fears going into the film, that we would simply be watching Franco play Wiseau. But instead, all I saw on screen was Tommy Wiseau. He gives the film so much of its comedy, as well as its emotional core- - and it all stems from Franco's performance. That is absolutely an accomplishment on Franco's part, and he is deserving of an Oscar nomination for it in my eyes. Dave Franco is really good in the movie, though he didn't lose himself in the character of Greg Sestero quite like his brother did with Tommy. I could mostly see Dave Franco in the role, but that doesn't take away from him being as solid of a lead as he is. One of my favorite characters, second only to Tommy, is Seth Rogen as The Room script supervisor, Sandy Schklair. He captures the despondency of the role perfectly, and it makes for some great comedic moments. He's the most relatable character in the film, I find, simply because what he says and does is exactly how I would react to what was happening during the shoot..."
106,The Disaster Artist,9,11 December 2017,A thoroughly engaging salute to an incredibly disastrous film. How often does that happen?,"Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. Or so they say. They also say that one man's treasure is another man's garbage. Case in point was the events that led to the production of the 2003 indie film ¬ñ The Room ¬ñ which was made from a production budget of $ 6 million but returned only $1800 after two weeks of public screening. It was one of those 'so bad it's good' movies that over time, gained cult status for its bizarre narrative and off the wall performance by writer, producer, actor and director Tommy Wiseau. The Disaster Artist not only serves as a memoir on the making of The Room, it is unexpectedly one of the most engaging films about friendship and perhaps, over time, will even gain cult status of its own. Although The Disaster artist is intended as a biographical dramedy and succeeds as such, the film triumphs on many levels, starting with the portrayal of bromance between Tommy and his lead actor and co- producer Greg Sestero, who would later go on to chronicle events leading to the titular film. Playing the duo are the Franco brothers - Dave as Greg, and James as Tommy, with such poignancy and chemistry that we actually believe they are Tommy and Greg and want them to succeed. James Franco, known for outrageously hilarious bromance films from Pineapple Express to the bold and equally scandalous The Interview (with Seth Rogen as a frequent cohort) is in top form and perhaps his best turn as both the lead actor and director. Another rare achievement is Franko's wide range delivered in the same film. While he is absolutely hysterical throughout this film, Franco's real achievement is an auteur playing an auteur with the kind of convection that instantly makes Tommy Wiseau some sort of mystery man without solving or speculating the mystery surrounding him. But Franco is just one person. Across the length and breadth of this film, there are plenty of characters, cameos and Easter eggs in on for the ride. Yet at no point does the film seem too busy or crowded or stuffed. It gets to a point where we are not sure if we are laughing at one man's failure or one man's success at depicting another man's failure. Sure, it's a film within a film and we've seen films that are love letters to some of the greatest eras in Hollywood. What makes The Disaster Artist a remarkable standout is the fact that this is a moving and at times inspiring love letter to a film that not only flopped, but flopped spectacularly. Which is why the big beating heart of the film is its artistic calling on what perception means to the beholder. Franco and everyone else involved just found gold in what everyone else discarded as trash."
107,The Disaster Artist,9,10 December 2017,The film is a story of friendship between Tommy and Gregg as well as the filming of The Room and a zany comedy.,"The Disaster Artist: ""I don't want a career, I want a planet"". So says Tommy Wiseau, Director/Producer/Writer of The Room, arguably the worst movie ever made. The film opens with Tommy (James Franco) literally climbing the walls in an acting class. He convinces a fellow student in the class, Gregg Sestero (Dave Franco) to move to Los Angeles with him, to become stars. Gregg makes minor progress but Tommy's total lack of talent and weird behaviour brings on disaster, he insists on performing Shakespeare when his acting coach tells him he would make a good villain or monster. He cannot accept rejection, when a movie producer tells him he could never succeed in a million years, he responds: ""but after that?"".Undaunted, Tommy decides to make his own film, eventually producing an incoherent script for The Room in 2001 which will star himself and Gregg. Tommy's bizarre directing style alienates both actors and film crew. But pouring $6 million of his own money into the film he finishes it.Tommy is an enigma, he claims to be from New Orleans but has an Eastern European accent. When he first meet Gregg, who is 19, he also claims that he is a teenager but looks 40. With his flowing long black hair he looks like Byron (think Gabriel Byrne in Gothic) or a Vampire (think Tom Griffith in John Carpenter's: Vampires). He has apartments in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, putting Gregg up for four years there. No one knows where Tommy's money cones from but as a bank teller comments, his account is a ""bottomless pit"".The film is a story of friendship between Tommy and Gregg as well as the filming of The Room and a zany comedy. Tommy's behaviour has to be seen to be believed, incapable of altering or even modifying his accent, hamming up every scene. He is jealous of Greggs relationships because it means he gets less attention. But they are still friends today.The film became a cult classic and even turned a profit eventually. Tommy went on to claim that he had always intended the film as a comedy rather than a serious drama.James Franco deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of Tommy but this film may be too bizarre to attract the necessary attention."
108,The Disaster Artist,10,10 December 2017,"James Franco's ""Ed Wood""","After seeing ""The Room"" and hearing that James Franco and Seth Rogen are making a movie about the making of the greatest bad movie ever made, how could I not be stoked? I love this movie, from the performances, especially Franco's, the writing, the relationship between Wiseau and Sestero, and the humor that goes along with the movie.Before seeing ""The Disaster Artist"", I watched Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"", another film about a filmmaker with ambition and poor talent. Both these films explore horrible filmmakers fulfilling their dreams despite the negative criticism they receive and the ironic legacy they have on the public.With that being said, this film is truly James Franco's ""Ed Wood."" I highly suggest you check this film out."
109,The Disaster Artist,10,10 December 2017,How to be Shameless and Get What You Want,"Guys, I just came back after watching what could possibly be one of the funniest films of 2017. If you have unrealistic dreams and don't have the talent to realize them just watch this film. This man called Tommy Wiseau didn't know how to act, didn't have an attractive personality and yet he went ahead and produced, directed and acted in this film called ""The Room"" which is considered to be one of the world's greatest bad films ever made. Tommy was or maybe still is an adamant, passive-aggressive human-being who wanted to continue to be an unprofessional and bad actor/director because there was this strong sense of entitlement that was embedded within him which told him NOT TO CHANGE. And look at the awesome things that have happened to him in his life. James Franco has directed this film and stars as Tommy in the film. James and his brother have acted brilliantly but it is very important to take a leaf out of Tommy's book. If you suck at something, keep sucking at it until such time somebody considers your sucking to be some extraordinary form of talent. One of the best dialogues from this film is something like this: ""Your worst day as an actor on sets is better than your best days anywhere else "". Leave everything and watch this movie right NOW. I'll give this movie a thunderous 10 OUT OF 10"
110,The Disaster Artist,6,9 December 2017,The Disaster Artist,"Out of all the hilariously awful trash films that exist, from ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" to ""Troll 2"" to ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"" to all of Neil Breen's films, none are as famous or as disconnected from normal human interaction as ""The Room"". And none of their creators are quite as intriguing and puzzling as the enigmatic Tommy Wiseau.But, as ""The Disaster Artist"" makes clear, this cult classic never would've existed without his best friend, and co-star of the film, Greg Sestero. After witnessing Tommy's passionate performance of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" at his acting class, timid Greg Sestero approached him, asking if he could do a scene with him. Tommy of course said yes, and proceeded to help boost Greg's confidence by giving him an acting lesson in the middle of a coffee shop. From there, the two united over their shared ambitions of becoming Hollywood stars, and with Tommy's mysterious, seemingly unlimited supply of cash, they moved to L.A., and the rest is history.Of course, there's a lot more in between and after that, but if you've ever seen ""The Room"" you basically know the end result. But ""The Disaster Artist"" isn't primarily about the making of ""The Room"", although that takes up the majority of the second half, it's main focus is the unlikely friendship between Greg and Tommy, who are played by Dave and James Franco, respectively. It could've been very distracting that two brothers were playing two best friends who were in no way related, but, due to James Franco's fittingly stilted performance, I wasn't focusing on that at all.Also, although he's been making pretty poorly reviewed films for years, this is Franco's first major directorial effort, and the first film of his that I have seen. From a visual standpoint, everything seems pretty standard, other than some opportune long takes during a few scenes, such as the tense, uncomfortable, and hectic shooting of Tommy's sex scene. From an acting standpoint, everything seems pretty standard, other than Franco's performance. From a general directing standpoint, everything just seems pretty standard. All of it is fine, and none of it is really special. The writing has a few flaws as well, such as one very unrealistic decision by Greg and an incredibly rushed ending. The bizarre subject matter of this film is honestly what really makes this film work.The Greg and Tommy dynamic worked as an eccentric and his straight man, but the funniest part of the film was its depiction of the disastrous production behind ""The Room"". It began with many confused cast members, but a faint glimmer of hope but slowly spiraled downward, with personal tensions rising between Tommy and the other members of the crew, shooting going far over schedule, and Tommy's strangeness disrupting several days on set, such as one day where he didn't pay for air conditioning. But, other than one scene at his lowest point, Tommy never comes across as malicious, just horribly ignorant and oblivious to his own mistakes, which is partially of why ""The Room"" still reigns as the best bad movie ever made. Tommy single handedly created, ruined, and saved ""The Room"", all in one fell swoop.Many watch ""The Room"" and ask ""How could anyone who made this have thought it was good?"". And the truth is, they didn't. When the actress for ""The Room"" character Claudette is asked why she would drive such a long commute every day for such an obviously doomed film, she replies ""Because we're actors. A bad day on set is better than a good day anywhere else"". ""The Disaster Artist"" shows this kind of sheer commitment as both a virtue and a flaw, balancing between advocating pursuit of your wildest dreams despite everyone telling you otherwise, and warning against that pursuit."
111,The Disaster Artist,10,7 December 2017,A movie about a movie is so bad that is good became a great idea,"Honestly I don't know which one to compare between IT (2017) or this movie. This movie has strong performances from James Franco and his brother Dave Franco. The story sums up the events of The Room (2003). The Room is so bad that is good and the fame from Disaster Artist (2017) made that movie more popular. I enjoy this film a lot. Someday I'll buy this film and The Room (2003).My favorite quotes from this movie ""YOU'RE TERING ME APART LISA!"" ""I did not hit her! It's not true, it's bulls**t! I did not hit her! I did not! Oh, hi Mark!"" (The quotes are from Jame's character Tommy Wiseau)"
112,The Disaster Artist,9,5 December 2017,James Franco SOARS as Tommy Wiseau in this Hilarious & Affecting Comedy!,"Tommy Wiseau's 2003 cult film 'The Room' is widely considered to be the worst film of all-time by too many, although I accept I haven't dared to watch the film yet. I did see the trailer though in anticipation for 'The Disaster Artist'. And oh boy, the trailer itself made it clear to me how big a dud it is.But Director-Producer-Actor James Franco takes inspiration from that super-dud movie & turns it into a behind-the-scenes look at 'The Room', and delivers his best film to date. Franco goes all-out in his portrayal of Wiseau, pitching in one of the year's best performances, that redefines comedic idiocracy to an all new level. Franco is a force of nature & portrays a terrible actor, with terrific timing. 'The Disaster Artist' is all kinds of amusing & ridiculous, but its never out of heart or genuine feeling. I LOVED IT!'The Disaster Artist' Synopsis: When Greg Sestero (Dave Franco, in good from), an aspiring film actor, meets the weird and mysterious Tommy Wiseau (James Franco) in an acting class, they form a unique friendship and travel to Hollywood to make their dreams come true.'The Disaster Artist', above all, is a story about dreams & ambition. Wiseau may never become the artist he thought he'd become, but he did make a movie & gained a cult-following, even if it was for all the wrong reasons. 'The Disaster Artist' explores Wiseau's unrealistically abysmal vision & what went behind the making of his dream project 'The Room', and turns it into an unexpected story on living your dream. Franco keeps the proceedings hilariously over-the-top & captures Wiseau's absurdity with the perfect blend of madness & ambition. With several laugh-out-loud moments & a few really affecting ones, Franco churns out 'The Disaster Artist' with astonishing success.Scott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber's Screenplay, which is based on the non-fiction book The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Film Ever Made by Greg Sestero & Tom Bissell, is splendid. The humorous tone is fabulously maintained & the sequences that follow one after the other, deliver big laughs, but its the relationship between Wiseau & Sestero, that is the emotional core of the film. Watching two men, one way crazier than the other, chase their dreams & believing in each other despite facing repeated rejection, is heartfelt & relatable. Franco's Direction is excellent. He's handled this comedy proficiently. Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume Design deserve a special mention. Make-Up, also, is very well-done.Performance-Wise: Franco's turn as Wiseau, is a Tour-De-Force. Right from his accent (which Wiseau proclaims to be from New Orleans, but sounds nothing like it), to the restlessness in his body-language, to delivering the worst performance as ""Johnny"" in 'The Room', Franco SOARS. This is his finest performance to date, that truly deserves Oscar-Attention. Go, get it Franco! Of the rest of the cast, Dave Franco does a good job as Sestero. Alison Brie is extremely charming as Sestero's girlfriend. Seth Rogen as the script supervisor is first-rate. Josh Hutcherson, Ari Graynor, Jacki Weaver, Zac Efron & June Diane Raphael, all who appear as actors in 'The Room', are hilarious to watch. Sharon Stone & Melanie Griffith appear in fun cameos.On the whole, 'The Disaster Artist' is anything but a disaster. This Comedy based on the Worst Film, is actually among 2017's best films! Don't Miss It.And...Oh, Haai, Mark!"
113,The Disaster Artist,10,8 December 2017,An ode to disaster,"The level of cult status that Tommy Wiseau's The Room has acquired over the years is one of those phenomenons I'd find hard to explain, having only seen it in full recently prior to the release of The Disaster Artist. It's literally one of the worst films I've ever seen but it's surrounded by this bizarre aura that makes it one of the most entertaining films you could ever watch, simply because of how bad it actually is. Based on the book of the same name, The Disaster Artist follows the friendship of the eccentric Tommy Wiseau (James Franco) and Greg Sestero (Dave Franco), both aspiring actors who embark on a personal journey together to make a film themselves. What they think could be their ticket to stardom ends up as one of the most notoriously bad films of all time in The Room.The idea of making a film about the making of one of the worst films going as a comedy driven biopic is a stroke of genius, particularly considering the talent involved. James Franco delivers riotous comedy in spades but this also works very well as a drama exploring the friendship between Wiseau and Sestero. I wasn't expecting the film to spend so much time outside of shooting The Room however, I'm glad it did as it gives an insight into their fascinatingly different characters and how they viewed success.The Disaster Artist is undoubtedly at its strongest when we see them shooting The Room, some of the scenes leaving me crying with laughter. The Room is full of unintentionally funny moments but watching James Franco try to deliver Wiseau's lines in his debut in front of the camera is a moment that will forever be one of the funniest in a film for me. The film's premiere is an incredibly touching moment, explaining why the film has become such a cult classic.Coming to the performances, The Disaster Artist features two great performances from James and Dave Franco, both playing off each other so well. James Franco literally becomes Wiseau it's actually quite scary at times, nailing the voice and mannerisms, while Dave captures the innocence of Sestero, a man led astray by the eccentric Wiseau, perfectly. There's fine support from the likes of Seth Rogen and Zac Efron too, while a whole host of cameos ensures the audience is kept entertained.The Disaster Artist is one of my favourite films of the year and having now seen both this and The Room, I'd happily go and watch a double feature at the Prince Charles Cinema as I'd imagine there'd be such a wild atmosphere. Let's get Tommy Wiseau to the Academy Awards!!"
114,The Disaster Artist,7,8 December 2017,A Hilarious Look at One of the Worst Movies Ever,"Of all of the worst movies ever made, ""The Room"" is by far the most fun to watch. It is so terrible that I don't think something like it could ever be made intentionally, so I was excited to get a look at how it was made. The Disaster Artist did not disappoint. We see most of it through Greg (Dave Franco) as he meets and befriends one of the most enigmatic people in the world, Tommy Wiseau (James Franco). Everything about Tommy Wiseau, from his thick accent to his preference for wearing several belts at once, is so absurd, that no one could make it up. There is also the strange relationship between Greg and Tommy, where Tommy becomes dependent and protective of Greg.The highlights of the film are when the experienced members of the movie industry observe Tommy and his inane approach to film making. This is where Seth Rogen gets his lines in as the script supervisor Sandy. They also painstakingly recreate key moments from The Room and show them both being filmed, and side by side with the actual movie just before the credits role.James Franco nails the role of Tommy, having the accent down perfectly and the constantly spaced out look. Dave Franco does well as Greg, though the height difference was notable, as Dave Franco is noticeably shorter than his brother, but the actual Greg was much taller than Tommy Wiseau. The rest of the cast is filled with recognizable faces as many notable comedians cameo."
115,The Disaster Artist,8,6 December 2017,A fascinating and often funny look into the making of The Room,"The Disaster Artist is a comedy-drama film directed by and starring James Franco. Based on the non-fiction book ""The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Film Ever Made"" by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell, it is a fascinating and often funny look into the making of The Room, a film widely considered to be one of the worst ever made.In San Francisco in 1998, aspiring actor Greg Sestero (Dave Franco) meets a bizarre, long-haired, heavily-accented man in his acting class named Tommy Wiseau (James Franco) and the two form a strange friendship. One day, Tommy persuades Greg to move with him to Los Angeles in hopes of pursuing their mutual dreams of stardom. Tempted by the thought of becoming famous, Greg immediately agrees and the two embark on an adventure through Hollywood. After neither of them receive any movie offers, Tommy decides to make his own movie, which will be written, directed, produced by and starring him and Greg in the lead roles.Charming and fun to watch, The Disaster Artist is an amusing but cautionary tale about following one's dreams and the longing to make it big in Hollywood, even if it does detract a bit from the book it was based on. The filmmakers did a superb job recreating some of The Room's most (in)famous scenes, from Johnny's (Tommy's) anger on the rooftop (""I did not hit her! It's not true!"") to his argument with his future wife (""You are tearing me apart, Lisa!""). James Franco is mesmerising as Tommy Wiseau. His mimicry of Tommy's mysterious European accent and mannerisms are on point, but never so much that they feel like outright mockery. James' real-life younger brother Dave Franco was also great as Greg Sestero. One can't help but feel sorry for the real Greg with what he went through helping Tommy get this movie made. While not a requirement, I strongly recommend watching The Room before seeing this film, as I feel it would help put certain moments in the proper context. Also, be sure to stay after the credits for a hilarious bonus scene.I rate it 8/10"
116,The Disaster Artist,6,6 December 2017,A film about friendship 6.5/10,"OK. So I had no idea what I was walking into and actually thought I was in the wrong screen - I judged the book by its cover and thought I was seeing a black and white film , something like The Artist ! So it took a while to fathom what was going on ,I couldn't understand why a 20 year old Mercedes C 220 was supposed to be special , only later did I realise this was set in the recent past ( despite the brand new Rolls Royce drop top shown at one point ) once I realised it was set around the millennium it started to work , weirdly I kept thinking I was watching the son of Tom Cruise playing the joint lead role Greg . Basically the story which I only realised at the end was based on a true story and an actual cult film ( can't believe The Room was never mentioned once in my film degree ! ) is about a chance friendship of two males both of which need each other to fulfill their dreams . They're both dreamers but one mysteriously has the financial means to make dreams come true . Tommy is an interesting character full of mystery , completely eccentric but incapable of forming meaningful relationships with anyone which was sad to watch as clearly he had his heart in the right place but his talents didn't match his ambitions whereas Greg had the talent but lacked the ability to promote himself and see a golden opportunity when it was in his face due to his loyalty . In some ways it reminded me of The Producers though they went out of their way to make a flop this film ROOM became a cult because it was so unintentionally bad So the film - Well if you're a fan of Apatow/Franco/Rogen then you'll love this and you'll love it if you're a fan of the Cult of The Room . Did I like it? Yes - I laughed in parts and I hadn't even realised it was comedy , I'd say it's more drama than comedy, I wouldn't rate it as highly as The interview or many of their other collaborations but as a craft , a story - it had a beginning , a middle and an end so it is a watchable story - you get to know the characters and you engage with them . Basically it tells the story of the making of the film and it tells the story of a friendship ad it does both well . It's a good film it's not an exceptional film but I'm glad I saw it :) If you don't have the talent but you have the money no one is going to stop you realising your dream ! Pad.A 6.5/10"
117,The Disaster Artist,10,8 January 2018,The Disaster Artist tells a fantastic story,The Disaster Artist tells one of the best stories ever. James Franco did a great job playing as Tommy.
118,The Disaster Artist,1,8 January 2018,Lets make a movie about a really bad movie and expect it to be entertaining,Absolutely the most self indulgent piece crap I've ever seen.
119,The Disaster Artist,4,8 January 2018,Based upon the worst film ever made..,"When Greg Sestero, an aspiring film actor, meets the weird and mysterious Tommy Wiseau in an acting class, they form a unique friendship and travel to Hollywood to make their dreams come true. I don't get the big deal about both The Room and The Disaster Artist and i'll admit Franco does an alright job as Wiseau but Franco on his own is freaking weird so it makes sense. Most of the jokes are a miss and the overall story it tries to tell isn't even interesting to begin with and since Hollywood wants more like that then maybe the 2nd one should be more focused upon other artists as well like Joel Schumacher, Adam Sandler or even Michael Bay. Overall i hated this film for the reasons of why i hated the film that it's based on as well but it's less painful at least although the cameos were. (4/10)"
120,The Disaster Artist,1,3 January 2018,Really ???,"Not even the Franco's could hold this above water.It was terrible and I love movies more than most.""The Disaster Artist"" is a story about the making of a 2003 movie called ""The Room"" which was written, produced, funded and starred Tommy Wiseau (a Polish guy who had a false sense of himself being young and talented) for an estimated $6 million. It's opening weekend take was $1,800. ???""The Room"" became a cult classic and over time has earned more that the initial cost despite dreadful ratings. And now - ""The Disaster Artist"" is being rated very highly. Oh come on people. There are better movies out there for Oscar nominations."
121,The Disaster Artist,2,2 January 2018,Why Franco....Why??!!! A bad movie about a bad movie,"I don¬¥t understand why this movie has high ratings unless these reviewers are fans of The room, one of the worse movie ever made. And talks about academy awards? What??!! Is not 127 hours, people. 
I liked other films from the Franco bros, and the rest of the cast but this...naaah
The actors from The disaster movie...sorry, artist, wore fake wigs and fake beards in the movie, this I also never understood. Was this to create an ambiance of a lousy movie or what?
And I don¬¥t understand why we don¬¥t know Wiseau¬¥s origins (birth place, birth date, where he got his millions. I wonder why the IRS never que$$tioned him??) Did the IRS got money from Wiseau for IRS ¬®charity¬®?"
122,The Disaster Artist,10,30 December 2017,ART,"This is ART. One of the BEST films of the year...where wannabes produce a film with no substance, other than passion to drive a lackluster film....and years later, is picked up and the old re-created, verbatum by a big studio with major stars 20 years later... What emerges is pure ART. For it is not about how bad the script/film is or its leading man...but the desired of all souls who wish to be simply heard..to tell their own stories. We all need that..... I highly recommend this film. It is the Dream of all...."
123,The Disaster Artist,10,30 December 2017,One of the Best Films and Performances of the Year,"Actor/Director/Producer James Franco has arrived, and you should not miss this outstanding film about Tommy Wiseau, the writer/director/actor of the now cult status film ""The Room"" - if you been in Hollywood over the past several years you've probably seen the numerous billboards for this film that no one saw. While ""The Disaster Artist"" is filled with numerous terrific familiar actors (Dave Franco, Seth Rogen, Ari Graynor, Alison Brie, Jacki Weaver, Paul Scheer, Zac Efron, Megan Mullally, Sharon Stone, Melanie Griffith, and the lis goes on and on), it is James Franco's Tommy character that is the heart and soul of this film. Where other actor/director/writes have failed this year (Kenneth Branagh - Murder on the Orient Express), James Franco knows how to use his stellar cast, while being able to commit to his odd character and oversee a quality entertaining film. So perfect and committed is James Franco to this Tommy character, that his performance ranks up there with such memorial characters at Tom Hanks' ""Forrest Gump"" and Dustin Hoffman's ""Rain Man."" The thing is, the film and the main character are so unique, and the ""real life story"" so farfetched and unknown, that Hollywood can't seem to find a way to get audience members into the theatre to witness the magic that James Franco has brought to the big screen. Equally sharing and filling the screen is Dave Franco as Greg (whose book the film is based upon), the handsome young actor who befriends Tommy, and together they make what maybe be the best of odd friends and the best worst movie of its time. Yes, there are other big films that will warrant your movie going experience, and other lead actors who will probably fill the ""Best Actor"" category during Awards time. However, if your looking for something extremely entertaining and oddly enjoyable ""The Disaster Artist"" should not be missed. I think this film ranks up there with one of the Best Films and Performances of the year."
124,The Disaster Artist,8,28 December 2017,A honest telling of a ridiculous story!,"The Room is considered by people to be the worst film ever made, I would probably put myself in that boat as well. Only for the reason that it tries so hard to be good that it fails at the basic elements of everything. Anyway when I heard that James Franco was gonna be doing a film about the making of ""The Room"" I was a little nervous because it could turn into a bit of a spoof. Luckily it is not a spoof, it is very good and really eye opening film into the life and world of Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero. Lets quickly ish get the compliments for the directing and the acting in the film over and done with, there are big elements to compliment and fry. Overall the directing of the film is good start to finish, but nothing amazing it is a solid film. The acting on the other hand is perfect, everyone in the film has been cast perfectly in there roles. From Dave Franco, Allison Brie and Seth Rogen to the surprise inclusions of Judd Apatow and Bryan Cranston are brilliant and hilariously funny. However obviously there is an elephant in ""The Room"".......haha get it see what i did......*cough*.....dust ball*............anyway, James Franco as Tommy Wiseau. One hundred percent deserves an Oscar nomination the resemblance to the real life person is incredible and actually quite worrying. The look, voice and physical movement are all so on point and add so much to the believability of the performance. Amazing!Its the actual story or backstory being told about Tommy and Greg's lives as well as the production of the film that is the heart of the film and the most interesting part. There was so much about Tommy and Greg that I didn't not know and it was extremely interesting to see there backgrounds and where they were when they met in 1998. It shines a light for me on the type of person, on the surface at least, what Tommy Wiseau was actually like at the time. Unfortunately it definitely does not do anything to improve his image in some ways it tells the honest truth about the man and that actually he is a delusional, idiot. He is a monster on the film set, being horrible to everyone there as if he knows best, and disregards everyones opinions as invalid. Even though it is shown that he didn't know what a DP on a film set was ! Its because he knew nothing about film making to begin with, which especially shows when he fires the only professional help he had on the production. Unfortunately it doesn't stop there and the monster he is continues with destroying a possible chance for Greg and his career. I assume considering that this film is based on the book written by Greg Sestero that the scene and side story about Malcom in the middle is true. It justifies why Wiseau is an arsehole by making Greg feel bad for even asking him about taking the day off.
Im so happy that they didn't shy away from telling this side of the story because it makes Wiseau look bad, this is honest film making. On the outside I never knew that he was this type of person, but you never know I suppose. Overall this film is really good 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, the directing and acting in the film is really strong for everyone but obviously the star is Franco. However its the story of the people and the production that give this film heart and momentum throughout. It is extremely eye opening, funny and brilliant people should definitely watch it. It now puts ""The Room"" itself in a new light !"
125,The Disaster Artist,8,28 December 2017,What a story Mark,"The Disaster Artist takes a few liberties with the source material but ultimately delivers an incredibly funny piece of work showing incredible love, devotion & respect for The Room coupled with an outstanding portrayal of Tommy Wiseau by James Franco."
126,The Disaster Artist,8,28 December 2017,Franco outdid himself!,"While Franco is using the well-known struggle and weirdness of the artist as a basis of the plot in The Disaster Artist, it's NOT to ridicule the hardship of achieving success in our field. Rather, it's to promote the cult of Tommy's movie The Room. A cult proving that even the most misunderstood of us can get their success by the virtue of passion and dedication.The Disaster Artist and The Room showcase how weird of an industry this is. Both movies decline the idea of the only one holy path to fame and success. Rather, through exposing the complexities of the story, they suggest that there are as many roads to one's dream as there are people in our industry. In my observation, the majority of new successful artists did not have a bright start at all; furthermore the newly acquired fame is not even where their final heart's desire is pushing them to be. They continue their journey on and on, be it through ANY public opinion... hatred, judgement, approval or disapproval. Most of them have their rocky road stories to share and bizarre ideas to remain unheard. Yet, Franco's movie simply features what is only a small element of the whole hardship of the successful story - actually the movie heavily emphasizes the strength to overcome even the worst backlash and continue on the path to the destination chosen. A famous example in the Film industry would be the Director/Writer Edward Davis Wood Jr., who is considered one of the worst directors of all times. Yet, he continued with his passion and dedication throughout his live, which in turn made him a really well known influence in the industry. Yeah, it may not be an influence ""for the better good"", but David Woods remains of a big importance for the growth of the Film-making community.It's well-known that the movie maker's path is statistically nearly impossible. But for those of us, wild enough to dive into the ocean of the unknown, and somehow get to the isolated isle of the moving pictures, in retrospective it allows us to collect stories... stories that one day would make audiences chuckle.Tommy Wiseau's life is one of those stories."

128,The Disaster Artist,10,25 December 2017,A 2017 Masterclass of Cinema! 'It's real Hollywood movie!',"The Disaster Artist chronicles the making of a movie notoriously bad yet oddly watchable: The Room; and this film is a love letter to moviemaking in general as well as a celebration and honest critiquing of artistic and personal persistence. The Disaster Artist is one of the year's best movies and makes for a surprisingly moving journey as well.James Franco plays Tommy Wiseau and he delivers a man not only far-fetched from humanity and the present, but a wannabe star in pursuit of Hollywood success and glamour. Was it all sunshine and roses? No; of course not, and neither was the actual making of The Room. The miracle The Disaster Artist pulls off is its celebration of failure and how there can be genuine passion from an ironic admiration of something as absurd as a poorly-made 2003 'romantic-drama'. The Disaster Artist is the best movie-about-moviemaking I've seen in a long time and Franco deserves an Oscar for his spot-on impression of Tommy Wiseau making him out to be an odd yet artistically experimental guy whose farfetched and absurd personality made him become a super-cult-star of an actor.The Disaster Artist: art born from an actual disaster. I love this movie! Easily deserves to be seen at the movies and easily worth owning on BluRay/DVD."
129,The Disaster Artist,10,21 December 2017,"You will want to watch it again, again, again and again.","Oh hai Audience!I watched this film hoping for it to be good but it was astonishingly a great film, the actors were spectacular especially James Franco who was just amazing in the film especially when imitating Tommy Wiseau's accent which is just brilliant and splendid. The movie also gives you a background of how Tommy started to make the room with Greg Sestero his best friend. The film does captivate you with Franco's performance and gives you an emotional breakthrough when two friends tried to make a film that spectacularly failed but in the end it had triumphed when people started to talk about the film.The film also shows how the production was made in The Room, Many people started to understand what the production was like when working with Tommy's project which absolutely made a lot of sense especially when Greg stated to make the film with Tommy and his crew.The Film is great and should be watched by those who have watched The Room and those who haven't but I think The Disaster Artist could be a film that inspires people who want to become actors and filmmakers.Go out and watch this film, you will absolutely love the film and Franco's Performance."
130,The Disaster Artist,10,21 December 2017,"The ""Disaster Artist"" is anything but","The Disaster Artist is an excellent film about making a film that is anything but excellent. James Franco, Dave Franco, and Seth Rogen give some of the best performances I've seen in my entire life. A captivating story, excellent acting, and an incredible recreation of the story of The Room make this film one of this decade's best."
131,The Disaster Artist,8,21 December 2017,Hilarious film and brilliant performance from James Franco,"James Franco's incredible performance as Tommy Wiseau is hilarious and shows his range as an actor. Greg (Dave Franco) is a young aspiring actor when he witnesses the wild, inspirational bravado of Wiseau in acting class. He asks the strange man to read a scene with him and Tommy invites him to a restaurant to read a scene in front of the other patrons. Greg feels powerful after the performance and they form a fast friendship. Inspired by Hollywood legends like James Dean, Greg and Tommy set out for Los Angeles much to Greg's mother's dismay. Tommy does not explain how he just has another apartment in Los Angeles on top of the apartment in San Francisco or where he got the money for his Mercedes. He lets Greg take the bedroom while he hangs up curtains for his room.Greg works to get an agent and land parts in television shows or films and finds some moderate success. He does meet Amber (Alison Brie), a bartender, and Tommy's jealous nature begins to surface. Wiseau makes up elaborate stories to pretend he is having success but his lies are easily disproved and his attempts to impress producers are met with scorn. Feeling downtrodden and defeated, Tommy is ready to give up when Greg gives him the idea to create his own film. The funding for this film remains a mystery but Tommy is convinced he can do it so he sets out to write a screenplay. He comes up with the idea of The Room, writes the screenplay, and shows it to Greg making him read it through while in a restaurant. Greg, in his optimistic nature, agrees to work with Tommy to create it and take on the second lead role. Together they set out to make the infamous film, The Room.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
132,The Disaster Artist,10,20 December 2017,An Absolute Blast For All 'The Room' Aficionados!!!,"I've read Greg Sestero's book three times and I had the pleasure of meeting him a few years ago. My friends and I love and adore The Room to pieces. When this movie was announced, I was ecstatic. I rarely ever say this, but this movie was a phenomenal superb masterpiece from beginning to end. It's so inspirational and full of heart. James Franco was hilarious and perfect as Tommy Wiseau. His accent was really spot-on. There were a few things from the book that I wished had made it into the movie, but overall I loved it and hope it wins Best Picture. The film starts in 1998 when Greg is a young aspiring actor taking an acting class under Jean Shelton. One day, Tommy Wiseau goes on stage and destroys Mar;lon Brando's scene in 'A Streetcar Named Desire' and keeps saying ""Stella"" over and over and starts climbing the walls. Greg becomes fascinated and wants to do a scene with him, and from there, their unique friendship was born. Over the years, Greg and Tommy can barely get any work as an actor, so they decide to make their own 'real Hollywood movie' Tommy begins working on a hot mess of a script called 'The Room' Tommy plays the character of Johnny, an all-American hero who has many friends and a beautiful future wife. (Johnny may or may not be a vampire) Greg plays the character of Mark, Johnny's best friend who betrays him by having an affair for his future wife, Lisa. Tommy buys all the equipment, spending up to six million dollars on the film. (To this day, no one knows where Tommy is from, how old he is, or how he made all the money) When the movie starts filming, that's when the trouble begins. The movie makes no sense, Tommy forgets his lines and it takes him 3 hours just to do the 'Oh hi Mark' scene. Tommy becomes more hostile toward his cast and crew. The Room is so hilariously interestingly bad, that it's amazing. My friends get together and we watch it every so often. This was a great film about the making of it. I'd be proud to have it in my collection. Another thing I loved was during the end credits, they show the original film side-by-side with the footage they re-created in this movie. A lot of the footage they remade was really spot-on, right down to their mannerisms. If you love The Room, and read Greg's book, you'll absolutely love THE DISASTER ARTIST!!!"
133,The Disaster Artist,,20 December 2017,Peculiar Project,"I wonder how many viewers saw ""The Room"" with the real Tommy Wiseau, because that way you get the needed background to appreciate ""The Disaster Artist"". ""The Room"" was a truly awful movie, so bad it has acquired a cult following and was riffed on MST 3000. I just thought this picture would have marginal appeal to a select audience.That said, I thought James Franco gave an astonishingly great performance as Tommy Wiseau, the Man With No Talent who wrote directed, produced and starred in this bomb for the ages. Franco is fascinating as the enigmatic, temperamental Wiseau and adds a dimension of vulnerability not apparent in ""The Room"". The film is based on the making of his signature movie, with some apocrypha added to flesh out the story. I still think you would have to have seen ""The Room"" for context.But I wonder, though. Why make a movie about a lousy movie?"
134,The Disaster Artist,,20 December 2017,"I worry a little that the filmmaker's are exploiting Wiseau, but I think it's a mostly loving tribute.","'THE DISASTER ARTIST': Five Stars (Out of Five)A comedy-drama biopic based on the making of Tommy Wiseau's 2003 beloved cult film 'THE ROOM', which is considered (by many) to be one of the worst movies ever made. The film was directed and co-produced by James Franco, who also stars as Wiseau. It was written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (the duo previously co-scripted such critically acclaimed hits as '500 DAYS OF SUMMER', 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW', 'THE FAULT IN OUR STARS', 'PAPER TOWNS' & 'OUR SOULS AT NIGHT'). The script is based on Greg Sestero (who costarred in 'THE ROOM') and Tom Bissell's non-fiction book, of the same name. The movie also costars Dave Franco (James's brother), Seth Rogen (who also co-produced the film), Alison Brie (Dave Franco's wife), Ari Graynor, Josh Hutcherson and Jacki Weaver. There's also a load of other celebrity cameos in the movie as well (including ones by Kevin Smith and Judd Apatow, two of my favorite filmmakers). It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics (especially for Franco's performance), and a shitload of awards attention as well. I found it to be a very powerful, and well made movie! It's also pretty disturbing though. The story begins in San Francisco, in 1998, where young aspiring actor Greg Sestero (Dave Franco) meets another aspiring actor named Tommy Wiseau (James Franco). Tommy is much older than the 19-year-old Greg, and he's also very odd, eccentric and possibly mentally unstable. Greg is impressed by his passion for acting though, and the two become close friends. They then move to Los Angeles together to pursue their dreams. After failing to get cast in any major roles, the two decide to make their own movie together, 'THE ROOM', so they can cast themselves in big roles. The film then follows the whole long, bizarre process of the making of that cult classic movie. The film is a beautiful character study, of a very unique but passionate character, Tommy Wiseau, and his loving friend, Greg Sestero. The Franco brothers are both good in their roles, and Rogen is once again a fantastic scene stealer. Franco also does a really good job directing. I love the movie, because it's about having an uncontrollable passion for an art form (film in this case, and mine), and it's also about accepting people that are different, and dealing with their mental illness. The film is really disturbing, and intense to watch at times, because Wiseau's mental illness does sometimes turn abusive, and creepy. It's still always incredibly fascinating to watch though, and funny. I worry a little that the filmmaker's are exploiting Wiseau, and others involved in the making of 'THE ROOM', but I think it's mostly a loving tribute. I really enjoyed it, and I do think it's one of the year's best movies."
135,The Disaster Artist,10,20 December 2017,Absolutely hilarious,The Disaster Artist. Absolutely hilarious. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Brilliant acting and writing. James Franco deserves an Oscar nomination. I want to see it again!
136,The Disaster Artist,8,18 December 2017,One of the best movies I've seen in a while.,"This movie is somewhat of a masterpiece on its own. James Franco's portrayal of Tommy Wiseau is a phenomenal piece of acting from a great actor, but at the same time, this is one of the weirdest roles to play. Most of the casting was good, but some people were just mis-casted. For example, Josh Hutcherson playing Phillip Haldiman, or ""Denny"", was not the right choice. He doesn't really suit the role, and just doesn't seem like the right casting. I'm not saying he's a bad actor, but he just doesn't work in the role. I believe some of the other people were mis-casted, but I can't really figure out who. Other than that, this movie kind of portrays Tommy Wiseau as a bit of an a-hole. He mistreats his cast and crew like garbage and doesn't even give them water during breaks on hot days between scenes. In a nutshell, James Franco portrayed Tommy very well and definitely nailed that unidentified european sounding accent. The scene recreations were very good and if you look at them side-by-side, you can really see that James Franco nailed the various scenes that were in the movie. Overall, this movie is fantastic and I would definitely recommend it."
137,The Disaster Artist,9,18 December 2017,Great Film for anyone who loves the art of the cinema,"The Disaster Artist is a great film with a fantastic performance by James Franco as Tommy Wiseau. This is the story of a wannabe actor Tommy Wiseau who is both a heroic and tragic character. This is the story of Tommy Wiseau producing, writing, directing and actin gin his own film, The Room. Great films are defined by the quality of six basic elements: script (story), characters, acting, timing, visuals, and sound. Wiseau's film had one maybe two of these things: sound and visuals. This is mainly due to the fact that he spent the money to hire a professional crew. Tommy is someone who is clueless in how to produce, direct, write or act. Yet, his character is both heroic and tragic in his desire to produce a film. The story starts off with Tommy and Greg Sistero meeting in a an acting class. Greg is having trouble relaxing and exposing his emotion as part of his performance. He sees Tommy recite some lines from A Streetcar Named Desire which can best be described as wild abandon. Greg is impressed introducing himself to Tommy and they become friends. They both move to LA and try to get acting jobs. Tommy utterly fails and Greg also has difficulties landing parts. As a result, neither is able to get any acting job. As a result, Wiseau embarks on a journey to write, direct, and produce his own film. He is oblivious to the advice of any professional with whom he surrounds himself. In this case, Seth Rogan plays the amused Sandy Schklair who is an experienced script supervisor working on the production of Wiseau's film. Throughout the story, Wiseau has a mysterious source of money so he can buy (rather than rent) all his equipment and pay a production staff. Throughout the film, Franco shows through his performance that Tommy is both a wild eyed dreamer and a deeply lonely and wounded individual. Greg Sistero is played by Dave Franco who demonstrates the characteristics of a loyal and almost star struck friend. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a story of great characters."
138,The Disaster Artist,9,18 December 2017,One of the funniest of the year,"'The Disaster Artist' is written by Scott Neudstadter and Michael H. Weber, based on a book of the same name by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissel, and is directed by James Franco. It also stars Franco as Tommy Wiseau. The film is about the friendship between the aforementioned Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero and how it led them to make what is often called the worst movie of all time namely 'The Room' . And that is an important point to make- Franco and co were not so interested in superficially showing how Wiseau made a terrible movie and getting us to laugh at it but rather in showing that Wiseau is a passionate artist and legitimately believed that he was making a masterpiece. The strong elements of the movie lie in Franco's lead performance as Wiseau, which is one of the best of the year, and in the script which allows us to engage with Tommy and learn about his inspirations as well as his often wacky and peculiar mannerisms. The direction is less impressive and rather understated but I imagine it is rather difficult to direct yourself directing a movie which is exactly what Franco does here. Dave Franco costars as Greg Sestero in a competent performance but one which is overshadowed by his brother's. As I mention in the headline of this review it is very funny but not in the typical way Franco tries to be in his usual stoner comedies with Seth Rogen. It is funny because of the genuine bizarre behavior of Tommy Wiseau and especially the reactions he garners from his cast and crew on the set of 'The Room'. Coincidentally, Rogen is also in the movie as Raphael i.e. the script supervisor on 'The Room' who in actuality ended up directing a large portion of the movie due to Wiseau's constant lateness to set and general incompetence. This is also a departure for him as you won't hear his patented 'pot laugh' in this film. All in all 'The Disaster Artist succeeds wildly (and even elicited applause at the end in the screening I attended) due to the strong central performance by James Franco and the comedy and heart and he and the screenplay bring with it."
139,The Disaster Artist,9,17 December 2017,Absolutely Worth the Anticipation,"As an ironic fan of The Room and a legitimate fan of the book based on the making of the movie and the friendship of Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero, The Disaster Artist, I had been waiting months in anticipation for James Franco's film adaptation of said book. To say it did not disappoint would be a gross understatement, it was an amazing thrill ride. What makes the movie authentic is how faithful it is to the book and Tommy Wiseau. While a few things were obviously changed here to either fit the running time to work as an adaptation, it still succeeds in capturing Sestero and Wiseau's friendship from when they first met at an acting class, to living in LA to get their acting careers off the ground, to the troublesome production of their movie, to the premiere. It makes both characters very relatable to the audience, especially whenever Greg tries to understand Tommy's view on the world while being by his side.The movie can almost be seen as the modern day Ed Wood in how it ""seems to hold a certain amount of respect for Wiseau's chutzpah, while also critically looking at what makes The Room such a disaster"" (Stefan Ellison). Granted it doesn't present Wiseau in as positive of a light as Ed Wood did with Mr. Wood, but as eccentric and oddball as Tommy seems, all he really wanted was to bring his vision to life. Same applies to Greg Sestero, because he chose to tag along in the making of The Room just to get his name out there, let alone be there for Tommy.Speaking of the making, what Franco nailed in his direction was recreating the scenes from The Room for this movie, and the resemblances are near uncanny he did such a good job. As for the behind the scenes making, the crew are just like how they were described in the book, from script supervisor Sandy Schklair and cinematographer Raphael Smadja summing up anyone trying to comprehend Tommy's method of filmmaking, or lack thereof. Like in the book, Tommy was both an incomprehensible weirdo and an asshole that really tested the crew's patience during the making from one scene to the next, and Franco does not shy away from Wiseau's sudden outbursts and egocentric attitude.As for the acting, it is simply wonderful. While Dave Franco is good as Sestero, James Franco accurately nails the role of Wiseau, really capturing his indistinguishable accent, his laughable attempts at acting, and even his emotions, whether they be soft, angry, or even sad. Anyone can imitate Tommy, but it takes a genius of an actor to capture the right emotional key of someone, and Franco hit it home. Even the many well known actors in the film are well casted, like Megan Mullally as Greg's overly anxious mother, to Judd Apatow as a obstacle of a producer towards Wiseau, to Seth Rogen as the aforementioned Schklair, to Alison Brie as Sestero's cute albeit concerned girlfriend Amber, and even Josh Hutcherson and Ari Graynor as Philip Haldiman and Juliette Danielle doing whatever it takes to follow Tommy's orders as the actors, while getting annoyed in the process.Overall, James Franco's adaptation of The Disaster Artist is a worthy tribute to the friendship of Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero and their movie. By showing the side of Hollywood with struggling artists making films most likely not seen outside of late night programs, it still shows how astonishing it was to see Wiseau complete his phenomenally terrible $6 million passion albeit vain project and have it play in a theater. What could have easily been forgotten about has become a staple of disastrous cinema around the world by thousands of people. Without the movie's growing popularity, we would not have gotten to see the hilarious and faithful book that inspired this movie. Tommy's Planet may forever be a mystery, but we have The Room and The Disaster Artist to help us theorize where this fascinating weirdo originated from, let alone where he got the money to make his movie."
140,The Disaster Artist,10,17 December 2017,Movie of the year,"In the spirit of the movie, I'm going to write this review without editing or looking it over at all, its just gonna be a stream from my mind to the keyboard. WOW. I didn't think i'd like this movie this much. I expected funny moments, which there were many of, but I didn't expect any of the depth or emotion this movie would bring, the chemistry between Tommy and Greg is fun to watch and actually heartbreaking at times. I want to say more but it doesn't do it the same justice as watching it. The story, the acting, the humor, it's all so good. With regard to the acting, James Franco and Dave Franco are at their absolute best and I think they deserve awards. The next most memorable performance was Seth Rogen who was hilarious.I think 2017 is gonna go down as one of the greatest years in cinema given the hard hitters that have come out. As of right now I have this movie neck and neck with blade runner as my favorite of the year, which is saying a lot given how good this year has been."
141,The Disaster Artist,9,16 December 2017,The Disaster Artist is both an endearing and hilarious biopic from the Franco brothers.,"The Disaster Artist is a biographical film about Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero and the making of one of the worst movies ever made called The Room. This movie stars James and Dave Franco and is also about the friendship that develops between both Wiseau and Sestero.This is an Ed Wood-esque film about a man aspiring to work in the movie industry who, despite continuously getting knocked down over and over, continued to follow his dreams. In terms of it as a movie, it's similar to that of Ed Wood. Either way, this is a hysterical, endearing look at two underdogs who unintentionally made it big. I was laughing out loud frequently at this film, almost every joke hit, if not, every joke hit. I wasn't the only one frequently laughing either, the entire theater was laughing, even during scenes initially shown in trailers. Aside from the comedy, this offers more than just that. This movie offers a look at Tommy's softer side, which I personally could hardly see out of a guy like Tommy. It was genuinely hard to see him looking saddened and heartbroken during said scenes. James Franco's performance was absolutely fantastic. From the accent, to Tommy's strange acting to his overall performance, he just simply did an incredible job portraying Tommy. I heard that he even directed the entire movie in his Tommy voice, which is incredible, even for him. Near the end, they reenact certain scenes from The Room such as the ""I did not hit her!"" scene and the flower shop scene, which were very impressive and spot on.My flaws for this movie are small and few in between. For example, I think that the other actors from The Room like Juliette Danielle could've used a more in-depth look. I remember hearing that she was uncomfortable doing the sex scenes with Tommy and I wish we would've gotten a bit more out of her regarding that. Another flaw that I have is more of a nitpick. It's that James Franco's voice hardly sounds anything like Tommy's. It's not his fault though, again I'm nitpicking more than anything.I loved this movie, even with its small flaws. The Disaster Artist is anything but a disaster with its intriguing story, great humor and heartbreaking moments about one very strange man's dream of becoming a big name in Hollywood and managed to become big in the end for the wrong reasons.9/10"
142,The Disaster Artist,9,10 December 2017,"Hilarious, heartfelt, dramatic, and intense","""The Disaster Artist"" was perhaps my most anticipated movie of the year. So you better believe I spent an obscene amount of money on tickets to force my family to come see this movie with me; after all, they can't say no when I already bought out a whole row of reserved seats at my local theatre. I sat down in my reclining chair, practically salivating, and not just because I bought an extra large hotdog and a cherry Coke. The trailers were painful to sit through. The theatre was packed - there hasn't been a theatre so full since ""The Simpsons Movie."" We sat through trailers about fish monster romance and people shrinking themselves for some unknown reason, and then finally, after 20 minutes, we had to sit through another preview about the cinemas new monthly reward club, and then our movie started.And immediately everyone started to laugh. The first 20 minutes of the movie brought forth practically non-stop laughter from everyone in the audience. People laughed at the small references, the visual gags, and of course, the actual jokes that the movie was making. But then, maybe after about 30 to 40 minutes, some seriously heartfelt drama started to appear, which made the movie take a turn for the better. You see, everyone expected ""The Disaster Artist"" to be a goofy, silly comedy film, but in reality it is much more than that.Tommy, played masterfully by James Franco, becomes such a sympathetic character that at points the movie becomes too sad to laugh at. For example, there is a wonderfully intense scene where Tommy, when filming the infamous bellybutton sex scene, starts arguing with his film crew. It's supposed to be funny as well as dramatic, but the film paints such a sad picture of Tommy that the scene just becomes depressing. And this isn't a bad thing at all, this just shows how emotionally powerful this so-called comedy really is. Yes, the movie is very funny, but at its core this movie is a character study of Tommy Wiseau; it is a look inside of his desperately lonely but yet somewhat positive life. What I mean is, it is obvious that Tommy wanted a friend in his life, as is evident by his almost homoerotic possessiveness over Greg. But, Tommy absolutely stopped at nothing to accomplish his dream, which is, in my opinion, very commendable. ""The Disaster Artist"" shows how lonely Tommy is while also showing how much he wanted to make his lifelong dream a reality, and in addition to that the film is truly funny, even though there are many points where you'll feel so bad for Tommy that you won't want to laugh at him, even though the movie wants you to.If you thought that ""The Disaster Artist"" was just going to be a one-note comedy, then you better get that notion out of your head now because this film is much, much more than that. I didn't, and it was obvious that the rest of the audience didn't, expect this movie to be as dramatic and sympathetic as it was, but the drama and the study of Tommy's character and mind are truly what makes this movie as fantastic as it is, and I can tell you right now that if James Franco does not get an Oscar nomination for Best Actor then he is being robbed. Please go see this movie. It is not only one of the best comedies of 2017, not only one of the best dramas of 2017, but it is most definitely one of the best MOVIES of 2017. Anyway, how's your sex life?"
143,The Disaster Artist,9,10 December 2017,As Entertaining as it is Endearing,"The best filmmakers are the ones who put their heart and soul into something they had a specific vision for and see it out until its release. Albeit a strange and unclear vision, Tommy Wiseau certainly envisioned something for The Room. Whether or not he knew all along that it would be interpreted at a comedy (there's no way), who knows. But there will always be room for people in Hollywood who put everything into making a film. The Disaster Artist does its best to exemplify the balance between a chaotic mess of making a movie to the heart and devotion of someone trying to make their dreams come true.The Disaster Artist takes a mostly comedic approach to the source material, but it does have plenty of heartfelt moments, thanks to the chemistry of the Franco brothers as Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sistero, two men devoted to making their own Hollywood movie since the city continues to ""disrespect"" and ""misunderstand"" their talents. I'm always on board to watch a movie where people pursue their dreams, especially those trying to make it in Hollywood. Throw in the fact that Wiseau remains a mystery in real life, as does the production behind The Room, and you have yourself a movie worth making.Something The Room clearly didn't do is establish a specific tone to ensure everything runs cohesively throughout the movie. Where scenes constantly come and go with no real reason or explanation in The Room, The Disaster Artist makes good use of its runtime to make a quick and memorable bio-drama that is equally as entertaining as it is endearing. I initially walked away from watching The Room with confusion and misplaced laughter, I came out of The Disaster Artist even more fascinated with Wiseau's history and the troubled production of The Room.So although Wiseau never could have imagined there would be a movie made about his trainwreck of a film, I can't help but feel happy that Wiseau eventually got to this position, and in a way, fulfilled his dreams. 9.0/10"
144,The Disaster Artist,10,8 December 2017,Torn Apart,"Have you ever had an embarrassing failure in your life? Have you ever been told that you were so bad you'll never achieve your dreams, no matter how hard you've tried to achieve them? This is the story of every artist, successful and unsuccessful, in which they are forced to overcome the all too typical adversity of the cruel city of Los Angeles. But sometimes, when a door is slammed in your face, an even better one is opened next to you. Walk through that door. It's the door that enters The Room.Released in 2003 to the sound of crickets was perhaps the worst film of the past 50 years. A film so monumentally atrocious, it was destined to be a cult classic of Rocky Horror Picture Show proportions. Starting it's run late-nights on Adult Swim and skyrocketing into meme heaven on YouTube, The Room became a beloved cinematic train wreck and the world became fascinated with the human enigma known as Tommy Wiseau. Greg Sestero, the film's co-star leaked the juicy behind the scenes details of The Room in the hit autobiography The Disaster Artist, which revealed that the film had a more troubled and depressing backstory than anyone would've imagined. James Franco took it upon himself to bring this story to the big screen.What we get is a masterful movie about making movies. The Disaster Artist is an all-time crowning achievement in biopic history. It deserves to be recognized alongside 8 1/2, Ed Wood and Boogie Nights. I laughed uproariously as much as I felt terribly sorry for the unfortunate beautiful soul that is Tommy Wiseau. A man who wants to be famous at all costs, both literally and figuratively. A man who nearly destroys every relationship in his life to make The Room, a film that ultimately people love to hate. You can say that it's a tragic comedy that makes a mockery out of Wiseau.. that is until the scene of the film's premiere in LA. From horrified gasps to raucous cheers, The Room goes from DOA to the stuff of legend in less than 90 minutes. If ever there was a story about someone who fell face first into fame, Tommy Wiseau is the one. James Franco is phenomenal, alongside his younger brother Dave Franco (as Greg). I loved seeing these two together and the amount of heart they pour into the rocky friendship of Tommy and Greg. These are two men that love each other dearly and who's souls were meant to come together, despite the disaster (if you will) that ensued.What else can I say but.. YOU ARE TEARING ME APART!!!"
145,The Disaster Artist,10,8 December 2017,"Follow your dreams, even if it's a disaster","An excellent comedy that's also a cautionary tale of sorts. While Tommy and Greg have a dream, and they have the means to get there (somehow), they're completely blind by ambition. They can't see that their idea is doomed to fail, as they support each other on this journey to unintentional cult status. The movie's ultimately about ""The Room"", that's what so many people are coming to watch, what happened behind the scenes in the disasterpiece known as ""The Room"". And while a lot of humor comes from how strange Wiseau is, and how the movie will be so hilariously awkward and dumb, the comedy doesn't just revolve around that. It doesn't just use ""The Room"" as a punching bag for over 90 minutes. You don't have to have seen ""The Room"" to enjoy this movie. If you have, it's a love letter to the movie. If you haven't, it's a very funny story about dreams giving way to blind ambition. James Franco is perfect in this role, he gets everything strange about Wiseau down to a tee. You laugh at him, but you also feel sorry for him when people start to laugh at something he put $6 million into. As stated previously, I don't know whether to just laugh at the real Tommy Wiseau, or shake his hand for making a movie so inept, so flawed, so awkward, so bad, and yet it still makes me laugh to the point of tears running down my face. Please see this movie, it's a great comedy/drama/love letter to not only bad cult movies, but movies in general. And it perfectly drives home a very simple point: making movies is hard, but who cares, do what you want, you might get lucky."
146,The Disaster Artist,10,8 December 2017,"A great, funny and sometimes even moving story of the making of the best worst movie ever (Oh hi IMDb)","First off, yes I have seen The Room so I went in to this film with prior knowledge of what exactly it was about. Oh and yes the description ""The Citizen Kane of Bad Movies"" is a fitting description seeing I've called it the funniest non comedy movie I have ever seen. Also yeah I have also seen the actual Citizen Kane and that was brilliant too.This film was brilliant, James Franco really nails his performance as Tommy Wiseau from his first scene. The first time you see him on screen it all feels familiar about him but by the end of the scene you believe that he was Tommy Wiseau. And with a interview with the real Greg Sestero playing in the background Dave Franco really nailed him in his own way as well. But the thing about this film that stands out is the friendship between James and Dave Franco playing Tommy and Greg. Both actors were what really made this film, you get to feel and go through the ups and downs of making a film or trying to make it as a actor in Hollywood. And the rest of the cast help in the right kind of educated and often in a funny way how ridiculous and inexplicable so many of the things of The Room where neither explained or made sense. Only spoiler if you have seen The Room warning: All the spoon pictures never come up at all, that's the only famous thing about The Room that doesn't come up if you don't count all the questions everyone has ever asked about Tommy Wiseau but he never answers.But towards the end you really start to feel the emotions the main characters and it does work in a relatable way. There was a moment were they set up what would ultimately become The Room's legacy as a cult film (only one I know that I know of that has the kind of cult following you associate with The Rocky Horror Picture Show) and the I was actually moved by it. But I still had a good time enjoying the story of this film and being reminder of what made The Room so bad yet enjoyable. There is some irony that the worst film of all time was the basis of one of the best films of the year.So in all The Disaster Artist is a brilliant film and I would say that if you have seen The Room regardless of what you thought of it you should definitely see this film. But even if you have not there are plenty of things to enjoy about this film."
147,The Disaster Artist,7,7 December 2017,"""You can laugh, you can cry, you can express yourself, but please don't hurt each other."" - Tommy Wiseau","How anyone could watch 'The Room' - a nearly impressively incompetent flick which fails on seemingly every conceivable level and yet has captured the hearts of thousands of audience members, earning the unofficial title of 'best worst movie' in the process - an alleged thousand times is almost beyond my comprehension and yet this is exactly what James Franco claims to have done in order to successfully step into the skin of the strange enigma that is Tommy Wiseau, and, while his exact number may have been wholly hyperbolic, the sentiment still remains the same, a feature so universally panned is still somehow so universally loved and brings joy to so many people; 'The Disaster Artist', a biographical comedy/drama, aims to explore both how such an almost admirably ill-conceived work could possibly come about, let alone continue to be crafted to a release- ready point, and why it is so oddly appreciated, and what this particular picture does so well is recreate the most iconic segments from the original piece (a side-by-side comparison is almost seamless) while also paying homage to the little mysteries and tidbits that those familiar with it will appreciate greatly, but there's much more than just a collage of comedic callbacks to be found here, namely a rather meaty emotional through-line and fairly in-depth character study, and it is this that keeps the fairly funny feature from falling too far into parody. 7/10"
