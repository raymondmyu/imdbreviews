0,Cinderella,10,4 October 2005,Bibbidi-Bobbidi-BEAUTIFUL!,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen. They remain among the most popular animated films of all time. The first was his groundbreaking classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" released in 1937. The last was the then-under appreciated ""Sleeping Beauty"" which made it's debut in 1959. In between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale: ""Cinderella"" (1950). Of the three films, ""Cinderella"" is the one most faithful to its origins. Ironically, unlike ""Snow White"", which for better or worse, became for many the definitive version of the story. ""Cinderella"" did not follow the same path. Although it was a hit and, like ""Snow White"", was responsible for restoring the dwindling Disney fortunes, it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved. Disney, for once, did himself proud, electing not to tamper with a classic, instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale, rather than rewriting it for the screen. The result was enchanting. A combination of superb animation (in beautifully soft Technicolor) and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day. Ilene Woods, who was a radio performer, recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material, Al Hoffman, Mack David, and Jerry Livingston. When Disney heard them, he knew he had found his Cinderella. And indeed he had. Woods heartfelt renditions of ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"", ""So This Is Love"" and ""Oh Sing Sweet Nightingale"" are perfect. Eleanor Audley, who would go on to voice Maleficent in ""Sleeping Beauty"", masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother, while Rhoda Williams and Lucille Bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters. Luis Van Rooten admirably performed as both the King and the Grand Duke, and James Macdonald was endearing as both Jaq and Gus, Cinderella's devoted mice. William Phipps has little dialog as the prince (future talk show host Mike Douglas provided his singing voice) but film (and Disney) veteran, Verna Felton was born to play the fairy godmother, and she made the best number, (the Oscar-nominated ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"") her own show-stopper. Among the artists responsible for the ""look"" of the film, was Mary Blair, whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by Disney. Her elegant French-period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie. But, most important of all' are the believable characters--from Cinderella, right down to Lucifer, the stepmother's deliciously evil cat. They bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story, something very difficult to create in an animated film.In conjunction with the film's 55-year anniversary, (and, not so coincidentally, the coming holiday season) ""Cinderella"" has just been released on a special edition DVD. It simply has never looked better. The fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated--suffice it to say, it looks wonderful. An enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added, and serves the music well. The DVD extras, now a standard part of Disney Platinum Editions, are too numerous to list here, but as usual, some are directed towards children, some are slanted to adults, and the rest fall somewhere in between. But real fans will want to get the Deluxe Gift Set, because, along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches, it includes a 160-page hardback book, which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release, but much more as well. As usual for Disney, ""Cinderella"" will only be available for a limited time. So, if like me, you are a ""Cinderella"" lover, get it NOW! This edition is truly a ""Dream Come True."""
1,Cinderella,,15 July 2001,Delightful Disney animation with some pleasant songs...,"When I first saw 'Cinderella', I found it surprising that the mice had so much to do whereas in the fairy tale they were just incidental creatures. But Disney saw that giving them a big role in the main storyline was the key to providing all the humor and suspense needed to spice up the predictable story. The leading mice, Gus and Jaq are delightful creations and the valiant band of mice are given amusing bits of business.Artistically, the animation art has a rather glossy modern look despite the fact that it's an old, old story from 1697, a classic children's fairy tale that has been done countless times as either a film, a play or a ballet. But this version will charm Disney fans young and old with its imaginative use of animation and a splendid collection of tuneful songs.A highlight is the 'Cinderella Work Song' in which the mice make a dress for the mistreated Cinderella, full of inventive comic touches and accompanied by the intricate blend of song and animation. Add to that 'So This Is Love', 'A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes' and 'Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo' and you have a charming version of the Charles Perrault story.For villainy, the stepmother and her black cat (Lucifer) are two of the most brilliantly animated creatures in the film. The cat reminds me of a naughty black cat I once owned. The scene where the stepmother is stroking the cat as she gives Cinderella a list of chores is striking in its use of shadow and menace. Along with some dark touches, there is always a bubbling sense of humor, particularly in this sequence.Cinderella herself comes across as a pleasant heroine with a sense of humor herself, lifelike in her movements and one of Disney's more successful human figures. Disney's artists did greater art work in other films but this is a well-structured work, a great combination of music and clever animation. The pace is fast, even allowing for extended scenes of the mice and their shenanigans for the sub-plot. And Lucifer, the cat, makes a wonderful foil for their tricks.The Disney touch is evident in every scene and makes this charming blend of comedy, music and romance a film with timeless appeal."
2,Cinderella,10,20 May 2000,Enchanting and enthralling adaption of a classic fairy tale.,"Walt Disney's CINDERELLA takes a story everybody's familiar with and embellishes it with humor and suspense, while retaining the tale's essential charm. Disney's artists provide the film with an appealing storybook look that emanates delectable fairy tale atmosphere. It is beautifully, if conventionally, animated; the highlight being the captivating scene where the Fairy Godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic coach and Cinderella's rags to a gorgeous gown. Mack David, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston provide lovely songs like ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" and ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" that enhance both the scenario and the characters.Even though CINDERELLA's story is predictable, it provides such thrilling melodrama that one shares the concerns and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends.  Both the wicked stepmother and her dreadful cat Lucifer present a formidable menace that threatens the dreams and aspirations of Cinderella and the mice. It is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the viewers' interest.  The film's suspense, however, is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness, especially in the musical numbers.  It is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of Cinderella and her friends, moving the viewers to care for them.  Overall, Walt Disney's CINDERELLA is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century."
3,Cinderella,,12 December 2002,Magical,"Let's not be coy, this is one of Disney's finest animated features. The characters, the colors, the music, it's all wonderful. The studio was at it's absolute peak at this point, with the terrific ""streamlined"" look to the artwork, that would be changed to a more ""rough"" appearance in just a few years following this movie. And what's not to like about it? Cinderella is one of the more endearing characters to come from a Disney feature, her stepmother and stepsisters some of the meanest, and her mice and bird friends, some of the most charming. Memorable scenes include the ""Nightingale"" number, with Cinderella's reflection in the soap bubbles, the evil sisters tearing her dress to shreds, her arrival at the ball, and the trying-on of the slipper. Add to that some great numbers like ""Bibbodi Bobbodi Boo"", and the mice's ""work song"". A wonderful movie, that never loses its magic, no matter how old you are."
4,Cinderella,,16 April 2000,My first movie,"This is the first movie I have ever seen and it was love at first sight. Since then I've watched it a hundred times or so and collected the video in many languages. Cinderella is wonderful, funny and rich. I know that many people remember it for the mice and Lucifer, but look at the human figures: they're (with the exception of the Prince) perfect and truly convincing. For example the relationship between Cinderella and the stepmother is strongly rendered and it's clear that the girl fears that woman. The sequence of the fairy godmother is one of the best of all Disney films (what a dream the transformation of the dress) and the ball episode is exciting and fascinating in both drawing (note the use of the shadows at a time when computer coloring was far away), dialogue and music (the Cinderella Waltz ""So this is love"" is enchanting)."
5,Cinderella,9,12 August 1999,"A success, on the whole","People criticise Disney's animated features of the 1950s for being overly glossy, set in landscapes that are much too pristine.  That criticism is just.  And yet it can't be the whole story, because the two least glossy - ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Peter Pan"" - are also the weakest. ""Cinderella"", on the other hand, set in a world in which the very dirt sparkles, is clearly the best.It DOES look good.  The backgrounds are subtle and consistent; the colours are pure without being too bright.  The animation varies a bit.  I'll swear that some of the humans are rotoscoped - but then, the rotoscoped humans (including Cinderella herself) aren't full-blooded characters in the script, so this approach works well enough.  It's really the animals that make the movie.  I think the studio had never quite used animals in this way before, as totems rather than sidekicks.  The mice, for instance, are the creatures who draw us into the story; but they are really representatives or allies of the more colourless Cinderella.  The cat, Lucifer, is a kind of witch's familiar to the Wicked Stepmother.  (The cat is brilliantly conceived and animated - one of the best feline creations of all time.  The supervising animator was Ward Kimball and he modelled it on his own cat.  I wonder how he put up with the animal.)  This approach allows the animals to steal the show without drawing our attention from the main story.  Their actions are of maximum interest only in the light of the main story.Among the supporting cast the notable humans are the King and the Grand Duke.  The King is a one note character - he wants grandchildren and appears to have no other desires at all - but the note is struck in a pleasing fashion.  The Grand Duke is a put-upon character who deserves to be lifted out of his sphere as much as Cinderella does.  (Although he, of course, is richer.)""Cinderella"" is Disney's return to features after an eight-year hiatus, and neither with it nor with any subsequent movie would he recapture the raw brilliance of his early years.  Moreover he made things hard for himself by picking ""Cinderella"".  She's a passive heroine and there's not much anyone can do about that.  (Maybe I'm wrong on this score - I haven't seen the recent ""Ever After"".)  Nonetheless it is remarkable how successful Disney was in bringing this unpromising story to life, without cutting across the grain of its spirit."
6,Cinderella,10,23 April 2004,A Symbol of the Disney Magic,"As a young boy, I always sort of hated ""Cinderella,"" since I was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what Disney movie to buy.  I wanted ""Dumbo,"" but my sisters won out, and we got ""Cinderella.""  They thoroughly enjoyed the movie while I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures.A lot has changed since then.  My love of the Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World, and I now have two young nieces.  I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched ""Cinderella"" together.  With my newfound appreciation for all that is Disney, I watched ""Cinderella"" with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw.From the beginning of the movie, though, I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament.  Why was she such a slave to her stepfamily, and why couldn't she just run away?  I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming immersed in the story.  Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listening to songs like ""Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo"" and ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" sort of whisked me back to the theme parks.  I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring Cinderella Castle.Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney.  That may make many people scoff, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like Cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about.  The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Tinkerbell - embody why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world.While ""Cinderella"" may not be the strongest story, it is sort of iconic in Disney and movie history.  It represents that fun, idealistic, and fantasy-like wonderment we held when we were kids.  I imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many, many people out there.  It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it does represent all that I love and admire about the Company.My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)"
7,Cinderella,9,19 January 2004,Beautiful,"Cinderella takes me back, when I was a little girl I loved the princesses of Disney. Cinderella was one of my favorites because I always was so enchanted by the story. Any child or family members will enjoy this wonderful and magical story.We have Cinderella who is a beautiful girl enslaved by her wicked step mother and ugly step sisters. She cleans and cooks for them without ever receiving thanks. The only friends she has in the world are the mice in the attic that are so charming and musical. When the ladies receive an invitation to the King's ball to find a lady for his son, the prince, a.k.a. Prince Charming, they all get excited, Cinderella overhears the exciting news and asks if she could come too. Her step mother makes a false promise and says if she does her chores and such, she can come too. Of course, she doesn't keep her promise and destroys a beautiful dress she and the mice made for the ball. Leaving poor Cinderella behind, a wonderful thing happens, Cinderella's fairy god mother appears and creates a beautiful dress and carriage out of things from around the house and even makes the mice and horses into elegant horses and a driver for the carriage. When the prince sees Cinderella at the ball, he has fallen hard for her. All the ladies are jealous, including her step mother and sisters. But Cinderella must return home at midnight when the spell is broken, all she leaves behind is her glass slipper. The next day the prince is on a hunt to find this girl who fits the slipper and is making a stop at Cinderella's house where her step mother has found out about her night and locks her in her room. Can she escape in time to tell the prince that it was her at the ball? You'll just have to find out. Trust me, this is a true Disney classic with beautiful animation and classic music that is so charming. You can't help but fall in love with this masterpiece. A dream is a wish your heart makes, this movie captures everything a girl could want.9/10"
8,Cinderella,10,18 July 2013,A Childhood Classic of My Children and Mine,"In a small kingdom, the happily child Cinderella loses her beloved mother and his father marries with the cruel Lady Tremaine, who has the mean daughters Drizella and Anastasia. When her father dies, Cinderella becomes a servant in her own house and her stepmother and sisters feels only hatred for her. Cinderella's only friends are four mice, a dog and a horse that live in the house.When the King decides that his son, the Prince, should get married, he invites every maiden in his kingdom to a ball in order that the Prince could choose his bride. However, Cinderella's cruel stepmother does not allow her to attend the ball. When Cinderella is hopeless of going to the Royal Ball, her Fairy Godmother appears and uses magic to help her to make her dream come true. But she must leave the ball before midnight since the magic effect will end.""Cinderella"" is one of the classics produced by Disney that belongs not only to my childhood, but also to my daughter and my son's childhoods. This adorable fairytale is wonderful and should be mandatory to every child in the world. I do not have much to say, since I believe that most of the readers certainly know the story of ""Cinderella"". I feel sorry for those that have written stupid things about this lovely fantasy  what a poor childhood they had. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Cinderela"" (""Cinderella"")"
9,Cinderella,10,9 May 2005,The most magical of all the Disney movies for me. pretty excellent too,"Cinderella....I hadn't watched this film for about five years the last time i saw it. The magic remains. There is something that definitely contains that storybook feel, the songs entertain and the secondary character's all please. The villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile. Then there is the most magical of all Disney, the mice making the dress and well you know the rest. To sum up the four of the Disney princess movies are all great but this is a charming magical experience, watch and enjoy. Oh and of course, Cinderella is wonderful as the main character in the movie.If you think about it Disney movies can really lost their charm. With Elene Wood and others the movie has such a feel to it, you simply can't help but smileThey say the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course in the real world some are believers others are hoper's. In this film it's even more the magical when her rainbow comes smiling. And of course the rest is...Cinderella"
10,Cinderella,,31 December 2013,Charming Fairy Tale,"Cinderella (1950)*** (out of 4) Very charming animated feature from Disney about the abused Cinderella who is kept from a Royal ball by her wicked stepmother. Thankfully, with the help from some birds and mice, Cinderella manages to get to the ball where she's a hit with the Prince. Cinderella isn't the most original Disney film when you consider that the story had already been filmed before and I'm sure most little girls already knew of it. With that said, as familiar as the story is, the movie still makes for an entertaining 74-minutes. I think the biggest reason for the success is that the story itself is one I'm sure most little girls dream about and I'm sure many can connect with the lead character. I think the film remains entertaining for boys as well thanks to the supporting players including the mice who easily steal the picture. The battles between the mice and the overweight cat were a lot of fun and there are some terrific sequences with the two including one where two of the mice try to get some jewelry but the cat isn't going to turn them over without a fight. Another great sequence happens towards the end when Cinderella is trapped in an attic and the mice must come to her rescue. The vocal performance are all extremely good with Ilene Woods standing out as the title character. The animation is at the highest level, which you'd expect from Disney. Again, I think this falls well short of being a ""great"" film but there's no doubt that it's fast, fun and contains some memorable characters and a charming story."
11,Cinderella,7,8 September 2013,"""The thing-a-ma-bob that does the job is bibidi bobidi boo""","Not the best of Walt Disney's feature length animated films, but any film that has Bibidi Bobbidi Boo and A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes has to rate as good in anyone's standards.I saw this for the first time as a small child on Walt Disney's Disneyland hour and it was as effective on the big screen as well as the small. I don't think there's anyone who is literate in the western world who does not know the story of Cinderella. The story is intact and kept in the mythical medieval times it was written for.As a subplot to the main story we have the story of Cinderella and her relationship with the animals around the house. The pecking order is dog, cat, mice with a horse thrown in for good measure. Naturally the evil stepmother who is voiced by Eleanor Audley has the cat as her favorite. What does that say about us cat lovers.Ilene Woods voices and sings A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes which Perry Como made a big hit record of. Bibidi Bobidi Boo is sung by Verna Felton who voices the Fairy Godmother. She's unforgettable in this role although she's better known as Hilda Crocker, Spring Byington's Ethel Mertz on December Bride. This is one eternal film that I hope my niece let's my new grandnephew check out and his sister or brother to be."
12,Cinderella,10,4 March 2002,A deeply beloved animated classic,This is very easily one of my Disney animated films ever made because it is such a delightful adaptation of the classic fairy tale.  The characters are a lot of fun to watch and the story was handled excellently.  The songs in the movie are also very good to listen to and fit perfectly into the movie. I strongly recommend it to any Disney fan.
13,Cinderella,3,4 July 2006,I know I'm going to take heat for this...,"but ""Cinderella"" gets my vote, not only for the worst of Disney's princess movies, but for the worst movie the company made during Walt's lifetime. The music is genuinely pretty, and the story deserves to be called ""classic."" What fails in this movie are the characters, particularly the title character, who could only be called ""the heroine"" in the loosest sense of the term.After a brief prologue, the audience is introduced to Cinderella. She is waking up in the morning and singing ""A Dream is A wish Your Heart Makes."" This establishes her as an idealist (and thus deserving of our sympathy). Unfortunately, the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about. Freedom from her servant role? The respect of her step-family? Someone to talk to besides mice and birds? In one song (cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest DVD) Cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently. You go girlfriend! In short, Cinderella is a very bland character. She passively accepts her step-family's abuse, escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief. She only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family. For this, she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear, a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except, of course, Cinderella. Can anyone see Belle or Jasmine being such a doormat? If Cinderella is dull, her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless. The Prince in Cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time. We are given no indication if he is a good man, if he respects Cinderella or anything. All we know is 1) he is a prince and 2) he dances well. Heck, even the prince from ""Snow White"" got to sing a romantic song at least. Not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting, it makes Cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot, weakening her already tenuous appeal.Perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were, the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie's comic relief, Cinderella's friends, the mice. Granted, these characters are amusing. Even so, when the comic relief steals the show from the principals, well, let's just say your story has some problems.Dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as ""masterpieces."" While many of them are, there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way. Cinderella is a prime example of this fact."
14,Cinderella,,12 January 2016,"""Poor Cinderelly!""","Classic Disney adaptation of the Cinderella story. It's a charming, lovely fairy tale with romance and quite a bit of humor (perhaps too much for some tastes). It's not very fashionable today but it's one of those films that has stood the test of time and will continue to do so, long after one generation of whiners and malcontents has been replaced by another. The voice work is wonderful and the music enchanting. The memorable songs include ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,"" ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,"" and ""So This Is Love."" The animation is the strongest selling point. It's Golden Age Disney, so you know the characters and backgrounds are well-drawn with rich, gorgeous colors that really pop. The only negatives are the story's familiarity and a little too much comic relief provided by Cinderella's animal friends. It's a beautiful story, told in that inimitable classic Disney style. Recommended for everyone who isn't a cynic at heart."
15,Cinderella,8,21 February 2012,What is the secret of Cinderella's charm?,"Ah, the Charming Prince  Charming because he's tall and handsome, and Prince as the son of an authoritarian figure, powerful and rich enough to guarantee a material comfort and young enough to have no responsibilities whatsoever and full time to have fun with his beloved one well, there's a reason why this myth is still persistent in many girls' minds.But let's not get too cynical, I guess there is another reason why ""Cinderella"" is one of the most famous and universally appealing stories, beyond the originality of the plot with the famous midnight strokes and the fancy ball dress, there is a simple and inspirational message. On the surface, it's about a young beautiful girl who'll get the Charming Prince thanks to something that makes her completely unique, but we all know it's the fairy tale definition of the wags to riches concept that paved the way to many underdog stories, providing hope for both women and men. Capra owes a lot to ""Cinderella"", ""Rocky"" is a 'Cinderella' story and it's not surprising that such a feel-good tale ended up being adapted into the (how fitting) twelfth animated Disney film, in 1950.Now, is it accidental or logical that Walt Disney's ""Cinderella"" got itself the ninth place in the American Film Institute's Top 10 Animated films? I'm inclined to say both, not to diminish the merit of the film, but just to remind that there were many other Disney animated features that deserved this place, ""The Jungle Book"", ""Sleeping Beauty"" to say the least, or how about ""The Little Mermaid"" or even a forgotten classic non-Disney film titled ""Gulliver's Travels""? Yes, there is an interesting divergence between the film's recognition and cultural status and its content, which is relatively banal considering the glorious collection of animated masterpieces the Disney Studios provided. I'm not saying I'm not a fan of ""Cinderella"", but I might be biased because my favorite version will forever be from Tex Avery, I'm talking of the legendary ""Swing Shift Cinderella"", which always made me howl of laughter.I also was never a big fan of Disney princess-themed films, which I thought were too formulaic and never contributed to something new since ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". Anyway, I had the recent opportunity to watch both ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Cinderella"" and somewhere while viewing the second, I had to reconsider my opinion because something was strangely appealing to me I couldn't point my finger in. Was it Jacques and Gus, the funny little mice? Maybe. Was it the scene-stealing sequence featuring the Fairy Godmother, the pumpkin carriage and the unforgettable Boobiddy-boos? Probably. Or was it the intimidating Stepmother, Lady Tremaine and her shadowy bitchy look? Yes, I guess so. But still, we can find the same elements in other Disney classics. So I finally realized that the secret in ""Cinderella"" simply depended on the appeal of its titular character.In many aspects, Cinderella embodies the same condition than Snow White, but there is something fresh and modern in her personality that appears right in the first scene, she's not overly romantic and she doesn't take her work as a servant without detachment, even humor where am I going with that? Simply that we never feel sorry for ""Cinderella"", as she's not portrayed like a victim, something intelligently hinted in the early scenes. Take the first confrontation with the stepmother, when she's unfairly punished: Cinderella's eyes betray a feeling of true anger, anything but a desire to cry. When she learns that she might be the bride, she's so hypnotized by love that a beautiful smile enlightens her face, and she looks incredibly sensual. ""Cinderella"" is modern by today's standards without the archetypal free- spiritedness disguising a real spoiled personality a la Ariel or Jasmine. Cinderella is modern because she is practical.This is important because the obligatory supporting characters fulfill their roles, the stepmother and her ugly daughters are the perfect contrast for Cinderella but the movie mostly works because it didn't forget to have a central character, realistic enough to inspire our empathy and needful enough to give the characters a moment to shine, whether it's from the precious help from the cute chipmunk-like talking mice or the providential help of Bruno, the brave dog. And another interesting thing about Cinderella is that for once, it doesn't need dragons, or killings to be entertaining, and although the last act is set in a house, it's an efficiently suspenseful climax, carried by the memorable character of the Grand Duke who's charged to try the shoes on every eligible girl.The Grand Duke is an important character not just for his comical pairing with the King, but also for the way he inspires the most evil action from the stepmother, when she makes him fall and break the shoe, her look says a lot about how she doesn't give a damn about one's life as one of the most truly despicable villains from a Disney film (who'd call a cat Lucifer anyway?) and coincidentally It also allows the heroine to own her by giving the other shoe, which was already proving that she was the one. The close-up on the stepmother's face at that very moment is the highlight of the film as it finally puts an end to Cinderella's torment. The film doesn't forget to be a fairy tale, yes it's all about the myth of the Charming Prince, but the key that forges Cinderella's appeal is that she's not a passive character.And they lived happily after  despite the predictable conclusion, ""Cinderella"" remains a timeless classic that gets in fact, better after each viewing, so there's no use to ask what the secret of Cinderella's charm is, the answer is in the question. It's precisely the unique charm of a universally, timelessly and (might I add) physically appealing character."
16,Cinderella,4,28 May 2013,Not that great... feels like tom and jerry,I really wanted to like this movie but it is not romantic or classic. It adds nothing to the basic story of Cinderella that we have always heard. The scenes are very pretty and the animation is very good but the most part of the film focuses on the mouse-friends of Cinderella and the mean cat belonging to the step mother. It feels like tom and jerry and by the end of the film you are too tired of watching the animal characters. As another reviewer has mentioned there is no background given of Cinderella or any insight into who she is or what she is all about and no screen time what so ever to the prince himself. It starts well and then gets very very bland. The fairy Godmother is very lovable and so is the King but there is nothing that Cinderella herself brings to the movie. I would recommend watching Enchanted instead.
17,Cinderella,,13 September 2008,Slippery,"Recently, I watched ""Snow White"" and was amazed again. So I had to follow it with this, which is a sort of nadir in the art of film. The story, is actually every bit as promising as ""Snow White"" was. In fact to my mind it is better.Unjust subordination. Magic. Love at first encounter. A sexual union. Loss (magic again). Search. Reward.Now, in the source stories, there are plenty of versions that were explicitly bawdy in the search and what was attempted to fit into what among all the eligible maidens. But even without this, there is plenty of room for fable elaboration. You could take this in many, many directions. These things are clouds of rich quantum possibilities.What does Disney do? Insert Tom and Jerry sequences. Where ""Snow White"" pulled short cartoons into long form film, this pulls by then well established long form animation back into short cartoon form.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
18,Cinderella,6,19 January 2006,Midnight never strikes when you're in love.,"Cinderella is one of the Disney classics that I watched in my childhood. I was never a big fan of Cinderella and in my opinion, there are many better movies from Disney than this one,like Aladdin,Little Mermaid, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast.Bbut I think Cinderella deserves some credit, since it is an important and very famous film. The story is about the beautiful Cinderella, who lost her parents when she was a kid and had to live with her cruel stepmother and bad ''sisters'' Drizella and Anastasia.(Her stepmother's daughters)Always treating Cinderella bad and making her a servant, the bad stepmother always try to ruin poor Cinderella's life. One day,the King determines that his son the Prince needs to find a bride, so invites every eligible lady in the kingdom to a fancy dress ball,where his son will be able to choose his bride. Cinderella's stepmother does not want to let her go, but Cinderella's Fairy Godmather will help her, making the prince and Cinderella to meet, and many problems to start."
19,Cinderella,9,5 January 2013,Charming and delightful,"This was such a charming and beautifully made animated film.""Cinderella"" is everything that an animated fairy-tale should be. It was delightful and highly enjoyable from beginning to end, showing in every single scene form this movie a ""magic"" that most of the animated films from the recent years lack, with wonderful designs and a exquisite level of detail in every frame.Personally, I consider this movie to be the best adaptation of the classic fairy tale written by Charles Perrault. Movies like ""Cinderella"" shows why the time when this was made was considered ""The Golden Age of Animation""."
20,Cinderella,5,8 December 2013,It's Disney.,"First of all, let's discuss the positives of this film, namely the production value. The drawings and the animation are gorgeous, and the music is catchy and perfectly-crafted. It's not for nothing that people speak of ""Disney magic,"" and what else would come to mind but a fairy godmother and a beautiful girl? Disney's Cinderella is certainly a cultural icon.And that's really unfortunate for our culture. Because, you see, the writers of the script decided to favor the synthesis of the eye candy magic over the essence of the original story. Disney's Cinderella appears to be an unwilling captive in a situation so bad we cannot understand why she does not run away: she IS shown to be of at least moderately illustrious ascendancy and surely she could at least start out in a more worthy setting somewhere else before her masters take note that she's perhaps issue of an education not quite comparable to that of the other scullery maids?Charles Perrault's Cinderella was rather clearer on this point. Cinderella loved her father and even though his second wife and stepdaughters were cruel to her, she stayed behind to look after them out of love for her father, knowing he wanted his two families to love each other and to meld together. This is made clear at the first ball (in the Disney version, there is only one, and the story is robbed of commensurate death): the prince takes notice of Cinderella and gives her a plateau of oranges and lemons (a rarity in 17th-century France), and she immediately finds her stepsisters and shares the dessert with them. The message is that Cinderella had it all to move up in the world, deep interior beauty as well as outer beauty, and just a little bit of divine intervention (through her fairy godmother) cleaned up and allowed people to look past an otherwise soot-laden exterior. She was noble both in birth and in character and she deserved the royal treatment she ended up getting.But Disney's Cinderella does... nothing. Not even talk. And she gets the prince's attention. And what, did she just leave her father's second family behind once she got into the palace? Not that they didn't deserve it (they deserved much, much worse, of course!). But the whole meaning of the original is lost. Her stepmother and stepsisters are not seen at the wedding. Disney's Cinderella is just a pretty but ordinary ""nice girl"" who happens to be of noble birth and possesses little gray matter.What's the point?? I mean, seriously, this stuff is porno for little girls. Yes, everyone wants to move up, everyone wants to be royal. And I'm NOT a feminist. But this kind of passive corset-stringing is not a good role model. The message is, ""Bide your time and be pretty and someone will come to rescue you."" What about developing the kind of loving and thoughtful character and self-esteem that will attract a decent man - and touch the lives of others while you're at it?Overally, really not a constructive addition to the film canon, whatever its technical merits."
21,Cinderella,2,9 May 2016,A very problematic Disney classic,"I'll receive many fingers down, but I need to be true to myself. As a child, I watched Cinderella oftentimes - I had a VHS. It is without doubt one of the most famous Disney classic, was a resounding success when released and was the film that saved the Disney studio going bankrupt. But leaving its historical significance aside, watching Cinderella today as an adult, I realize how this animation is problematic.To start, this movie has several scenes of secondary characters just for comic relief - the mice and the cat - what absolutely does not contribute almost nothing to the central story, feeling as a filler. Disney princesses films have a tradition of have fantasy stories, with lots of magic involved. But discarding the scene in which the fairy godmother appears to sing the song ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" (undoubtedly the pinnacle of the film) and the scene where the clock rings and Cinderella flees the Prince (which, together, does not reach even ten minutes), there is absolutely no magic remnant throughout the rest of movie - ever stopped to think about it? 80% of the movie, we just have Cinderella and mice in the stepmother's house doing trite and mundane things, or scenes with the King in the castle dreaming of grandchildren. Boring.Then we have a poor character development. Disney's Cinderella is not a good example of woman and heroin. She's a bland character, accepting mistreatment with passivity, and she always need others to get it out of their problems (mice, fairy godmother, the prince). Cinderella never changes the situation for herself. She falls for the guy just because ... he dances well? In no time the prince's personality is shown; we do not know if it will be a good husband to her, not even Cinderella have this certainty, but who cares, if he is rich, beautiful and is a prince, isn'it?And we have the animation, which is a bit disappointing. Unlike the beautiful painting that was Snow White (for its time), or stylish, graceful and unique backgrounds of Sleeping Beauty, the animation in Cinderella doesn't have anything extraordinary for a studio like Disney, and there are times really ugly looking. To this day I don't understand why the hell the animators don't draw toes for Cinderella. We're talking about a movie that the ""feet"" have considerable importance, are not we? Instead, we have a hideous ""close-up"" Cinderella wearing her shoes with her feet like a surfboard, or a quick sketch of a foot. I always thought it was horrible when I was a child. I mean, even a child of five years, to draw a foot, would have the decency to do ""risks side by side"" to represent toes.Seriously, Disney. You could have done much better.I gave two stars just for the excellent and beautiful animated sequence ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo""."
22,Cinderella,5,18 June 2015,"So, This Is Love (?)....","""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo!"" Yeah. Yeah. I know full-well that the story of Cinderella was, pretty much, just an empty-headed, little fairy tale about wishful thinking, and such - But, all the same, I found that there was definitely some really peculiar problems with this tale (as a whole) that prevented me, as an adult, from giving it more than an average rating of 5 stars.I mean, not only was Prince Charming just another pretty face with no personality to speak of at all, and his father, the king, a blustering idiot of the highest order - But I also seriously thought that the Cinderella character was clearly missing some of her marbles and even teetering on the edge of insanity by having real conversations with a bunch of mice and actually fashioning clothes for them.Another thing that caused me to doubt Cinderella as being a rational-thinking person was the fact that she allowed herself to be locked up in a tower and treated like pure garbage by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters. Like, wasn't there such things as ""Human Rights"" back in those days? Surely Cinderella could've found a reasonable out from having to endure the torment from these decidedly wretched people.I also found it rather odd that this animated film's most entertaining moments had little at all to do with Cinderella and more to do with the slapstick shenanigans that went on between the non-human characters, like Lucifer, the cat, and the colony of smartly dressed mice."
23,Cinderella,7,2 July 2013,"""Cinderella"" isn't Disney's best, but I think many people will be able to identify with the main character","Walt Disney's 12th full-length animated feature ""Cinderella"" (1950) was one of the first movies I ever saw as a kid along with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937) and ""Mary Poppins"" (1964). If there's something we all know from our childhoods, it's that the first few movies we see (especially Disney movies) are going to remain in our memories for quite some time. It was a great film to watch as a child, and for the most part, I still liked the film looking back at it as an adult. Unfortunately, due to some serious story flaws, ""Cinderella"" doesn't stand the test of time as well as either ""Snow White"" or ""Mary Poppins"" do. You know the story to this one. A young woman named Cinderella is forced to work as a maid to her evil stepmother and two stepsisters after her father passed away. Despite the terrible treatment she gets all around from them, Cinderella still remains kind and gentle. Furthermore, she at least has a few animal friends in the form of mice, birds, and other animals in the farm nearby. One day, the kingdom announces that the prince has returned and a ball will be held to celebrate this occasion. Every single person is to attend meaning Cinderella is eligible to go. However, her stepmother doesn't let her go and gives her more chores to do. That's when her fairy godmother comes in and.well, I think it's safe to say that you know the rest. Let's discuss the biggest issue I have with ""Cinderella"" as an adult. It makes the serious mistake of placing half its focus on the side characters rather than on the main characters. I'm particularly disdainful of the fact that more than a quarter of the film is focused on the adventures with the mice and the cat and yet we only see Prince Charming for around 2-3 minutes. Now why did the storytellers feel like this was the right direction to go? They even spend more time on the King and the Grand Duke more than they do with Prince Charming. It gets to the point where it should be the King who should be married and not the prince. I realize that it was hard to draw realistic human characters when ""Snow White"" was being made. So there's absolutely no excuse whatsoever for Disney's storytellers to drop the ball like that. In addition to the prince not having enough screen time or any personality, the mice have way more screen time than they should be having. And there's only so much of their cuteness that I can take. While these mice characters are at least useful to the main plot some of the time, a film that is titled ""Cinderella"" is supposed to be focused on Cinderella, not on a ""Tom and Jerry"" type subplot. The high-pitched voices on these mice don't help either. In fact, they make the problem even worse. Now despite the criticisms that the main character Cinderella gets for not being an assertive enough character, I have to be honest and say that I still liked her character wise. I admired how after all the misery she has been put under from her step family, she still maintains her kindness and positivity almost all the time. If that wasn't enough, she also tries to spread that positivity to everybody and every creature around her, so that they can all get along. So for that aspect alone, I think she's a good role model for young girls to look up to. Of course, I thought the stepmother was a well written Disney villain. Who wouldn't think so? She doesn't need any evil laughter to become more intimidating for our main character. The fact that she simply keeps forcing her to do more chores and not even give her any credit whatsoever is enough for me. Even though it's a little unusual that more time is spent with the King and the Grand Duke than on the Prince, I still think that they're enjoyable comic relief and they do keep the plot in motion as characters of this nature should be doing. The soundtrack by Oliver Wallace has a couple memorable tunes that I'm sure most of us are familiar with such as ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"", ""Sing Sweet Nightingale"", ""So This is Love"", and ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes"". Though it isn't as richly detailed as the earliest Disney pictures are, the animation here is nice and colorful in its own right. Overall, I think that ""Cinderella"" is okay. If it didn't make the serious storytelling errors that it did and if it focused more on the central characters, then I think ""Cinderella"" would be a more timeless Disney picture as a result. But for what it is at the time being, it's still a nice picture with a positive, harmless message for children about the importance of kindness and hard work."
24,Cinderella,9,24 February 2009,So inspiring!,"Cinderella was one of the first movies I ever saw, and to me it is timeless. It is a lovely looking film, with gorgeous animation. My favourite animation scenes were the dress scene- I just love those mice, and of course the iconic Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo sequence. The songs are also lovely, not as good as Snow White's, but they are a delight to sing, and are reminiscent of Tchaikovsky. A dream is a Wish and So this is love? are standouts. The characters are also a delight. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mice provided great comic relief. The stepsisters were also well done, as well as Lucifer. But I loved the stepmother the best, she was really evil, in comparison to a great character in the name of the Fairy Godmother. It is true, the movie drags slightly, with the antics of the mice with Lucifer, but they were genuinely funny, so I don't care. I don't think it is overrated, underrated don't you mean? It rarely plays on television, but the really bad sequel does on Cinemagic on a regular basis. if you want a great Cinderella adaptation, try the wonderful Ever After, or the lavish Slipper and the Rose, which isn't as good. But whatever you do, avoid the sequel, which I have the mistake of owning, because you'll thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox"
25,Cinderella,8,9 October 2016,Innocent and simple,"It's not a complex tale, but it doesn't have to be. It's a simplistic tale about falling in love, and easy to follow. I don't like it as much as other films in it's genre, but it made me laugh a few times and kept me interested. Much like ""Snow White"", the simplistic plot is helped along by stunning animation and timeless characters. I forgot just how evil the Stepmother and Stepsisters were. But unlike ""Dumbo"" for instance, Cinderella actually has a personality. She's kind, nice, and optimistic, which makes you actually feel sorry for her when she's abused. A lot of people like to say that the Golden Age of Disney ended with ""Bambi"", I don't agree with that. Sure they had to do a few package films to still gain income during World War II, but the charm and quality is still alive with ""Cinderella"". Obviously, the idea of a Golden age is just opinion, but saying Disney peaked with ""Bambi"" is a little far-fetched to me."
26,Cinderella,9,9 January 2016,A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes...,"After having adapted Snow White for the screen in 1937, I don't think there was a better way for Disney to return to the fairy tale genre than with the world's second most famous tale that takes place once upon a time.At the time of its' release, Cinderella was the company's first full-length feature film after a six-year hiatus due to all of the financial straits that were brought on by WWII. So, in crafting the film, Walt and his staff had to out all the stops and nearly bankrupted themselves in the process. Fortunately for them, Cinderella was a smash hit with audiences and critics alike, ensuring that Disney made enough money off of the film for them to produce many more animated films.However, the question is: Does Cinderella still hold up to this day? Is it truly the masterpiece it was hailed as in 1950? The answer to both is definitely yes! The film had many of Disney's top men working on it and it really does show. The backgrounds which were designed by the renowned female artist Mary Blair are not only beautiful to look at but are drawn in a way that gives them a breathtaking air of grandeur.The musical numbers by Mack David, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston are endearing, catchy and will no doubt find their way into your head after you've watched the film.Cinderella (gorgeously voiced by Ilene Woods) is a strong-willed, optimistic and independent young woman who you'll be rooting for the whole time as she manages to get all of the work her evil stepmother mercilessly piles on her without a complaint.Her mouse friends (voiced by James MacDonald, who also voiced Mickey Mouse) unfortunately get a lot of hate as many say that they take up too much screen time. However, I think that they are given just enough so that they do not overshadow the main heroine. Plus, with all the ways that they help Cinderella, I'd say that they are more likable and much better integrated into the plot than some of the comic-relief in today's Disney films (e.g. Olaf from Frozen, the Gargoyles from Hunchback.) The only thing that I would change about this film is the amount of screen time given to the Prince. Instead of having another scene where the King/Duke argue following the Ball, there should've been a scene where the Prince discusses his feelings for the girl he met.Other than that, Disney's 1950 adaptation of Cinderella is one that delights me as much as it did movie-going audiences of the 20th- century and will continue to have a special place in my heart for years to come."
27,Cinderella,6,21 October 2015,Missing that vital Disney Darkness.,"Good people are beautiful and can sing. Bad people are ugly and tone deaf.That's the Disney message here.Looks absolutely beautiful, though. The comic relief from the mice stops short of being annoying - often genuinely hilarious. I can't recall any real scares, though, and I tend to think it's the darkness in these old Disney films that made them special. Think of the Pleasure Island transformation scene in Pinocchio (1940).Also, I thought Cinderella looked way better in her ripped dress than the magic gown her Fairy Godmother cooked up for her. More edgy. But then again, this was 1950 and it wasn't directed by Luc Besson, so I should shut my face.Verdict: Classic Disney, from before the songwriting got too obnoxious, but missing the dark edge of some of the other early efforts.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com"
28,Cinderella,8,13 August 2015,Disney's Magic at its best,"This is another Walt Disney Classic (I know every film from that Time Period is a classic but still!), we all know the story of Cinderella so no plot to spoil really. But Disney's artists did a wonderful job in making this film truly look like an animated kids story book. I think that conventional artistry is or will soon be a forgotten art in today's 3D Animation CGI world. The rags to riches ball gown transformation scene and the pumpkin to a coach fit for a princess are just stand out beautifully drawn with excellent attention to detail. And lest we forget the soundtrack as always some lovely songs from Mack David, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston like ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" and ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" that enhance both the scenario and the characters."
29,Cinderella,7,8 October 2012,"Good movie, but where's a true element of evil?","When people talk about Disney Princesses, Cinderella is the first one that comes to mind. Although it's obviously targeted to a female audience, there's enough humor found in the antics of the mice, the cat Lucifer, the Prince's father, and his assistant to keep male audiences at least mildly entertained for the movie's 75-minute runtime. This is an exceptional fairy tale film, although a true element of evil like a witch or a sorceress who can turn herself into a dragon is sorely missed. Evil stepmothers just don't hold the same peril for me as something supernatural.After her father dies, Cinderella is left to the mercy of her stepmother. The wicked lady puts her stepdaughter to work as a servant. She cooks and cleans after the vile stepmother and her two daughters with a constant fear of being cast out of her own home. The Prince of Cinderella's homeland puts on a ball to find a wife. He demands the attendance of all the maids in the kingdom and the poor girl sees an opportunity for a temporary escape from her miserable day-to-day routine. Unfortunately, the depraved stepmother and her daughters have plans to keep Cinderella from attending the ball and meeting the Prince.http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html"
30,Cinderella,7,12 September 2009,The Chicken Soup of Classics,"Out of all the Princess stories Disney has put out there, Cinderella probably has the most enduring appeal. I can't really say why, but for some reason, generation after generation thrusts her to the top of their lists. As a little girl, I wanted nothing more than to be Cinderella with her glass slipper- it was my absolute favorite costume.Honestly, I don't think there is any story that more realizes the longings of the human heart than Cinderella. Who has never wanted to run away from the drudgeries of daily life and find someone who sees you as no one else ever had? The story is older than the English language and somehow it still rings true.As for the characters, if nothing else, Disney can make a wonderful villain. Lady Tremaine is evil to the T, in a wonderfully calculating, not overtly physical way. Her cutting tongue and eyes do the work for her- she doesn't need staffs of lightening to strike fear into your heart. The animal friends tend to grate, especially that idiotic Gus. I would have cheered had he met his fate in Lucifer's jaws. Cinderella herself was no pushover- making some justly catty remarks at times. However, she just lacked the drive to make her entirely sympathetic. Sure, she was nice and fed animals, but what was keeping her at that place? We never know. Even if she only became a maid in another house, at least she'd be getting paid and have a shot at respect. It seems the only reason things work out in the end for Cindy is that everything sort of falls to place in her lap. She never works for her dreams that she sings so fondly of.Which brings me to the music, which is lovely, as ever. Ilene woods has a lovely, rich voice, probably my favorite of any Disney heroine. Some big standards originated here- A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes, So This is Love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo...Cinderella is a wonderful heartfelt story with a ton of musical highlights. While it is lacking in some character development, it does provide some classic villains and excellent voice work. If you are feeling sick at heart, pop it in- it'll warm you up and make you hum Mmm Mmm Good!Quote of the film:-Surprise! Surprise! -Duh duh duh- Happy Birthday!"
31,Cinderella,8,6 September 2008,"I know, I can't believe I'm writing a review either","Walt Disney & his 9 Old Men put their own 1950 spin on the classic fairy tale of Cinderella, which I guess you could say helps form an unofficial ""fairy tale princess trilogy"" from the classic Disney years.THE PLOT: Cinderella is a nice girl who can't catch a break. She is the daughter of a nice, wealthy widower who loved her dearly, but her mother passed away when Cinderella was very young, and Cindy's father felt she needed a mother figure, so he eventually married the woman who would become known as Lady Tremaine, herself a widow with two daughters about the same age as Cinderella, Anastasia and Drizella. At first they all seemed to get along, but then Cinderella's father died, and Lady Tremaine's true nature was revealed - she was a cold, cruel, callous, heartless, mean spirited woman, and she passed those traits on to her daughters, who were spoiled, bratty, and equally mean spirited. Anastasia & Drizella hate Cinderella because they know deep down that she's better looking and an overall nicer, more attractive lady than themselves (i.e., more appealing to men), and their mother, Lady Tremaine, hates Cindy for pretty much the same reasons. As the years passed Lady Tremaine began to squander the family fortunes in a stubborn but futile quest to improve/refine her awkward, unattractive daughters (to call them ""homely"" would be an insult to homely people everywhere) while all three relegated Cinderella to being the multi-tasking servant of the house, abusing her, mistreating her and humiliating her every chance they get (they are particularly fond of increasing her already absurd workload). That brings us to Cinderella in the present, where she has blossomed into a good looking young lady who somehow manages to remain kind hearted and nice despite her abusive step family and holds on to the hope that one day the tables will turn in her favor. Cinderella gets her shot at freedom & happiness when a royal ball is held to introduce the local prince to an eligible young maiden so that he can take her as a wife, settle down, start a family, etc. Naturally, her step family tries to keep her from attending, even going so far as to physically assault her and rip up the dress she had procured for herself (with a little help from her mice friends - the dress belonged to her biological mother). Finally pushed beyond her breaking point, Cinderella runs out into the courtyard and cries in despair. It is at that point that her Fairy Godmother, a short, plump, jolly woman, arrives and provides Cinderella with transportation and a transformed dress (after all, Cinderella wouldn't make a very good impression at the ball if she entered the scene looking like she had just gotten gang raped). Cindy arrives at the ball, the Prince falls hard for her, but that pesky midnight rule gets in the way, forcing her to flee, but leaving behind a glass slipper. Make a long story short - after a long harrowing quest to find the mystery girl via trying on the glass slipper, Cinderella is found and she and the prince get married, giving her the happy ending she deserves.Overall, an enjoyable Disney classic. Not without its flaws, the most glaring of which is that the Prince is little more than a MacGuffin to help push the plot along - he has very little screen time and even less dialogue, so we never get to know him very well or get a good look at his relationship with Cinderella (which is unfortunate since, according to the making of documentary, the Prince was originally meant to play a bigger role), and a few additional scenes to help flesh out Cinderella herself might have been helpful (there was a song that showed her fantasizing of turning into an army of maids to clean up the house as well as eavesdropping on her step-family post ball to show her amusement at their jealousy, which was cut because Walt himself thought it made her look spiteful). Still, Cinderella herself is a likable enough heroine, even if she is upstaged by her mice friends, and there's a sweetness to the film that is becoming harder to find these days. Of course, if this were being made now, Cinderella would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax (either by picking the lock herself or making an impractical yet exciting jump down from her window) but this is beside the point.And for all those who say Cinderella sets a bad example for young girls, well, consider this - at least Cinderella didn't go around getting publicly drunk and indecently exposed, unlike some modern day ""princesses"" (you know who I mean)."
32,Cinderella,8,11 July 2008,Bibbidi Bobbidi Beautiful!,"""Cinderella"" is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics, a status it deserves. Based on the classic fairy-tale as told by Charles Perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella, a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally awful stepsisters. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: the King wants to get the Prince to marry so he can have grandchildren), Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand, and if you don't know what happens next, then I would seriously want to know why.I think we can all admit that the story of ""Cinderella"" as it appears in Perrault's collection wouldn't be able to pad out a feature on its own, so whilst generally staying true to the story, the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderella's true sidekicks, much like how the roles of the fairies were later fleshed out in ""Sleeping Beauty"", or how Jiminy Cricket in ""Pinocchio"" went from a minor character into the role of mentor. Two of the mice, Jaq and Gus, act as the principal sidekicks, with their own nemesis being a purely invented character, the obnoxious family cat Lucifer. The animal antics intertwine generally with the main plot, and reflect the general theme of the struggle between oppressor and slave (the little mice, birds and barnyard animals live in squalor, whereas the manipulative and selfish Lucifer lives in luxury). The film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and before the stepsisters depart for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really gets going again and surprisingly (since ""Cinderella"" is the most worn down story of all time, probably) ends up as one of the most involving and engaging of Disney stories. The stepmother is one of the most alarming of Disney villains due to her having a sense of reality. She doesn't use black magic like to get her way like the evil fairy Maleficent in ""Sleeping Beauty"" or the Queen in ""Snow White"", but regardless subtly controls and manipulates people to horrific effect, including her own blatantly insecure daughters. In short, she uses people skills to a truly terrifying effect.The animation and art direction is lovely. All of the legendary Nine Old Men animated on this picture, and Mary Blair's colour styling and concept art (she also did concept art and colour styling for ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Peter Pan"", ""The Three Caballeros"" and many many others) manage to wiggle their way on screen. The bold colours and whimsical, wavy designs are lovely, especially in the Fairy Godmother and ball scenes, where the characters often play against silhouettes of dark blues and violet. The staging feels theatrical and expressionistic, suiting the whimsical and romantic nature of the story adequately.Overall, ""Cinderella"" ranks as one of the best Disney fairy-tales and comes recommended to young and all. It embodies that uplifting philosophy so present in many Disney films - dreams really can come true."
33,Cinderella,7,18 July 2007,Classic fairy tale,"The 12th animated Disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story. Even though a little dated, it deserves a place in the list of Disney classics.It's not among Disney's top works, but is satisfying. One of Disney's most ""simple"" works, yes, but keeps a certain magic and enchantment (which old Disney is well known for). This was an important movie because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If this was a failure, there wouldn't be any more Disney animated classics.""Cinderella"" is somehow like a return to Disney's 1st animated classic (""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"") because it brings back the fairy tale genre. It's not clear where the story takes place, but I suppose it's somewhere in France because this is based in a tale by Charles Perrault.There are plenty of likable characters, such as Cinderella, the Prince, Bruno (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main mice), the Fairy Godmother (for a fairy she sure is funny), the birds, the King and the Grand Duke.Jaques is very smart and amusing. I love his voice. Really has that mouse-like quality. Gus might not be that smart, but he's humorous.The King is hilarious, but I think that what makes him so funny is his short temper. The Grand Duke is a very cool chap and funny too. They're two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing moments.The Prince is certainly one of the most charming in Disney. No doubt that Prince Philip from ""Sleeping Beauty"" was inspired on this prince, because they are very similar-looking.On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) isn't supposed to be likable because she's cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) aren't much better than her. However, the stepmother isn't as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, kind, pretty and lovable. By the way, I think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the Fairy Godmother.Lucifer (the cat) is hilariously malicious. The way he walks, sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny. Ironically he's very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the stepmother's attitudes towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he's such a devilish and mean cat. Yet, there's nothing annoying about him.The soundtrack is simple but pleasant, although not among Disney's best. The best song in this movie is ""Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo"".There are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this, such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten.Despite being simple-looking, the movie has good artwork, as well as its nice details, although never something ""out-of-this-world"". However, the King's palace is a spectacular masterpiece, being truly majestic and colossal."
34,Cinderella,9,14 October 2013,A true Disney classic from my childhood.,"This movie has stood the test of time for me over the years. It is still one of Walt Disney's best classics, I think.I haven't seen many renditions of Cinderella on TV or film, but this one could easily be the ultimate and timeless adaptations of the fairytale. Cinderella is portrayed as kind and gentle, but strong-willed character that overcomes her adversaries and befriends her animal friends, including the lovable mice Gus and Jaq. They add comic and charm to the movie and helps Cinderella go to the ball to find her Prince Charming. The stepmother and stepsisters went overtime in being portrayed as cruel and devious, including their sly and mischievous cat Lucifer (I just wished their coldness towards Cinderella was more counterbalanced). And, the Fairy Godmother, as portrayed in this movie, makes you believe in miracles.This movie is beautiful from start to finish - memorable characters, sweet and catchy songs, fast-paced plot, and a story development that just flows naturally and ""magically,"" making it one of the those films you would know that has the definite Disney-touch, as opposed to the more recent movies from Disney.This Disney classic is a definite for the movie collection for any family.Grade A"
35,Cinderella,7,26 November 2005,Straightforward Disney rendering of the fairy tale...,"Beautiful young woman, orphaned and living with her evil stepmother and two jealous stepsisters, hopes to attend the Royal Ball in the castle on the hill but may be thwarted by her cruel keepers and a decidedly nasty cat named Lucifer. Animated classic from Walt Disney has the company's signature style, but the scenarists skimp a bit on the background details. Walt wasn't exactly into character development, and the leading lady here is a bit of a masochist (one has to wonder, especially in this day and age, why she doesn't stick up for herself. Does she feel trapped or is her isolation a comfort to her after her father's demise?). The friendly, chattering mice who help Cinderella provide the comic relief, there are at least two excellent songs (""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" and ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes""), and many gorgeous moments of animated magic. Still, this plot is on the slim side (running time: 74 minutes), and is reminiscent of ""Snow White"" besides. Loaded up with villains, the movie could perhaps use a bit more of the grandmotherly Fairy Godmother (who literally vanishes); the pacing seems to stall after the big ballroom sequence, and the finale doesn't tell us what happened to the step-family. It's exquisite to look at however, and has some very funny slapstick. *** from ****"
36,Cinderella,8,4 March 2002,"I guess Disney really, really, REALLY needs money.","We watched this on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" on ABC last night, and I came to the conclusion that things must be tighter there at ""the Mouse"" than usual.  Since this movie only runs 74 minutes, and they had to pad it out to 2 hours of broadcast television time, they had, and I'm not making this up, commercial breaks that lasted 6 to 7 minutes.  And during these commercial breaks, they had another advertisement in the guise of a ""TV show"" hosted by the oh-so-annoying Kelly Rippa that loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of ""Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True"".Again and again, break after break, Disney took time out of the real movie to tell us, the loyal viewers, that we needed to get a copy of the sequel. Thank you, Disney, for doing us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie.Anyway, all this commercialism and cash-register-ringing made it a difficult task to get into the actual movie of ""Cinderella"", because by the time the commercials were over, I had forgotten where the story had left off.But of course, the original ""Cinderella"" still maintains its magic, and the story is still a good one, though we've all seen it countless times.  It's a shame they had to cheapen it with all the marketing for what looks to be a lame follow-up."
37,Cinderella,,23 February 2003,Quite good,"I always thought that Cinderella was a slightly weak heroine, and you'd have to reinvent her to make her at all interesting (which Ever After successfully did). It's a nice story though, aside from the fact that Prince Charming looks almost exactly like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty's princes...the stepmother is very good, and I liked how they made sure the mysterious gal at the ball WAS Cinderella (the glass slipper broke, Cinderella showed them that she had the other), because I always thought it was slightly vague for her to be judged on her foot-size.All in all, this is a nice story, but it doesn't make my heart melt like Snow White did. 6 out of 10."
38,Cinderella,7,8 October 2017,"Strong heroine, nice film","Cinderella is considered by everyone as one of the best films ever done by WDAS. With amazing animation and beautiful artwork, this movie is a visually stunning piece of art.The main character, Cinderella, is one of the strongest Disney female characters. You may not agree with me, but, from my point of view, anyone who is capable to keep her head up, while stuck in a hard situation, and still be nice and optimistic is a great role model.Furthermore, Cinderella is not just your average damsel in distress. Unlike Snow White and Aurora, she does not dream about love. She dreams indeed about her life getting better, but romantic love is not necessary for her. She wanted to go to the ball to have fun and because that was her right, not to marry the prince. In fact, she didn't even knew it was the prince the one with whom she had fallen in love.She is not as passive as some people believes she is. Some people complain that she never ran away, but seriously, what chances had a woman in the 18th century alone and without money? Running away wasn't an option. But she won't let her stepmother to take away her few rights. She demands Lady Tremaine to let her go to the ball, and doesn't hesitate to sass out Anastasia and Drizella. She works hard in order to fulfill the conditions her stepmother put to her, and is quite resourceful (no dress? I'll make one). She is just a victim of her circumstances.Lady Tremaine, without any magical powers nor musical number, is still one of Disney's best villains. Her cold, calculating, almost twisted personality is a effective menace to Cinderella.The King steals the show, provides comic relief without being over the top or annoying, and is a memorable and likable character. Same with the Grand Duke and the Fairy Godmother.With the exception of Prince Charming (or Henry), who may be a bit dull, the other side characters are funny and likable.The music numbers are quite good. Some funny songs (The Work Song, the iconic Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo), other are just lovely (So this is love, Sing Sweet Nightingale). On the whole, enjoyable.However, I must say, as a kid I never enjoyed Cinderella that much. To begin with, the mice have too much screen time, and most of those scenes are slow and don't really contribute to the plot.Also, it lacks scary/dark scenes. Not featuring any dark magic, warfare or dangerous situations, this film doesn't really have much action, and can get boring. However, this also make it suitable for toddlers and sensitive children, who might be scared by the more violent Disney movies.A good film, worth watching."
39,Cinderella,9,1 October 2017,Beautiful animation and an intimidating villain.,"Cinderella is a classic Disney fairytale and has both the great villain who psychologically abuses our main character and the cute animal sidekicks to support our main character as seen in earlier classics. Lady Tremaine is one of my all time favorite villains in Disney's animated movies. Her calm and collected persona even when being a monster towards Cinderella makes her intimidating and believable. I often see her as an inspiration to my absolute favorite Disney villain, Claude Frollo from ""Hunchback..."" (1996). They share a couple of traits. Eleanor Audley makes a brilliant develish voice for her. What did you expect from the voice of Maleficent? As fantastic as the Disney magic is, it also has its drawbacks. Cinderella herself is a passive female main character. I admit that she is an innocent, kind-hearted, hardworking maid, and that is a great contrast to the spoiled stepsisters and Lady Tremaine's abusive nature, but it stops their. She is supported by her little animal sidekicks and her fairy godmother and never does take matters into her own hands. It is justifiable as a product of the time and by the fact that it is a fairytale where everything magically comes true. The one thing I find lacking is the development of the prince. He barely says anything and that annoys me a bit. His father and his right hand man speak way too much and that could easily have been more balanced. Enough of my complaints. I think Cinderella is a great fairytale and I really like it. Go see it if you haven't already."
40,Cinderella,7,11 August 2017,Sometimes dragged but still magical,"This is a great movie, with such a wonderful, magical, classic touch to it. There are some flaws, however, and one of them is how much is focused on the mice, mainly Jaq and Gus.Though Jaq and Gus are extremely cute and likable, the story drags when you watch their parts, including how they fight and try to escape the cat, Lucifer, or how Gus is hungry and tries to get a large stack of corn. Cinderella even bothers to make clothing for the mice. Really? At least that was fixed in the live-action.However, the part where Cinderella goes to the ball is magical and memorable. Really, every part with Cinderella is perfect. She is an alto, a low singer, but she still has a wonderful voice and beautiful duet, ""So This is Love."" Prince Charming does not have many lines, but he is a great singer as well, and the man that voiced him, William Phipps, did a great job at putting urgency and distress into his voice. Though Cinderella may seem weak to most of us, especially with how she can't break down her attic's door, yet fat mice can squeeze under it, she is truly a strong and brave character. She is pretty much a slave to her stepmother and does what her stepmother wants her to, even when she doesn't want to. She is obedient and hopeful, still holding on to her dreams even when in hard times. Speaking of characters, though Lady Tremaine may seem like one of the smallest villains, she may actually be one of the most dangerous, with how real she is and how it is possible someone like her can exist.With how the movie drags when the mice are around, yet with the well-built characters, I give this 7/10 stars. It is truly magical."
41,Cinderella,8,16 December 2016,A Walt Disney classic that can sill enchant and entertain,"A Walt Disney classic that  while not as groundbreaking or charming as the company's first full-featured animated feature Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)  can still enchant and entertain, especially young (and still young at heart) girls. The movie features an Academy Award nominated Score (and Sound) including ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"", which also received an Oscar nomination, ""So This Is Love"", ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes"", and the title song, which in part is sung by Marni Nixon. Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske, the story was adapted by Bill Peet, Erdman Penner, Ted Sears, Winston Hibler, Homer Brightman, Harry Reeves, Kenneth Anderson, and Joe Rinaldi from the original classic by Charles Perrault. The film was originally distributed by RKO Pictures.After the early death of her loving father, Cinderella (voiced by Ilene Woods) is made to work as a maid and cook for her stepmother Lady Tremaine (Eleanor Audley) and two stepsisters Drizella (Rhoda Williams) and Anastasia (Lucille Bliss), all three of whom are jealous of her charm and beauty. Having been happily raised by her widowed father, who married widow Tremaine out of concern that his daughter needed a mother, Cinderella continues to keep an optimistic outlook and perform her daily duties cheerfully despite her circumstances, befriending the estate's animals: mice Jaq and Gus, dog Bruno (all voiced by James Macdonald), horse Major and various bluebirds (Marion Darlington). The Tremaine's aptly named cat Lucifer (June Foray) terrorizes the mice and causes Cinderella extra work every chance he gets.Meanwhile the King (Luis Van Rooten), who wants grandchildren, decides to welcome home his son Prince Charming (William Phipps; Mike Douglas, singing) with a Royal Ball to which he'll invite all the comely maidens, hoping one will capture his son's heart. After grudgingly giving Cinderella permission to attend, Tremaine and her daughters all but ruin her chances to impress, forcing her to do extra chores then ripping her (animal assembled) dress and beads apart just as it's time to go. This act of cruelty and mean- spiritedness finally causes Cinderella to burst into tears and run into the garden, frustrated that she'll miss the dance and perhaps the only opportunity to escape her situation.At this point, Cinderella is visited by her Fairy Godmother (Verna Felton), who magically transforms various items and animals into the coach, driver, footman and horses she needs to attend the Ball; she is then adorned in a sparkling new dress complete with glass slippers. Her Fairy Godmother then warns her that ""on the stroke of midnight"" the spell will be broken (and everything will return to as it was). Of course, this is more than Cinderella could ever have hoped for, and she proceeds to the Ball where she and Prince Charming share a dance, ""falling in love"" just as the clock begins to toll midnight. She dashes from the Ball to her carriage which rushes homeward before turning back into a pumpkin. However, she'd left behind one slipper.The King decrees that the owner of the glass slipper must be found, and orders his Grand Duke to visit every house in the kingdom to find her. Seeing how utterly happy her stepdaughter is behaving, Lady Tremaine correctly surmises the truth and has Cinderella locked her attic bedroom while the Grand Duke is visiting their estate. While the Grand Duke tries in vain to force the slipper on Drizella's and Anastasia's big feet, the animals conspire to help their friend, outsmarting and outmaneuvering Lady Tremaine and Lucifer to give Cinderella a chance to try on the slipper. When Tremaine trips the footman, the slipper shatters on the floor, but Cinderella then produces its mate. After it is revealed that ""the shoe fits"" her perfectly, Cinderella is whisked away to the castle where she and the Prince live happily ever after."
42,Cinderella,,27 August 2016,Your wish come true,"Disney must have a knack for wicked stepmothers who want to torture their stepdaughters. Cinderella is a bedazzling tale about a glass slipper that will only fit the foot of the one the prince fell in love with at the ball. Happening upon a cottage, its a race against time as the friendly mice must free her from a locked room, before he leaves and evade the cat Lucifer who wishes to spoil their heroic gesture.Cinderella deals with many themes making a rich thought provoking tale from dealing with abusive stepparents, what it means to be humble and how to be a good worker no matter what circumstances you find yourself in. Cinderella never complains or raises her voice and only asks to have the night off to attend the party. The mother's hatred of the girl is never explained left up to the imagination which I based on her father having more favor with his daughter before he died and thus opened up bad wounds between them. Like Snow White I found the prince's character lacking and his love for our fair maiden feels phony from one ball and never takes the time to get to know her. Other then this complaint I found the picture to be a magical experience I'll be reliving over and over again."
43,Cinderella,9,9 July 2016,A very good movie that the current public ignores.,"One of the great classics of Disney Studios, this film adapts to the film one of the most famous tales of Charles Perrault: Cinderella, the girl who lives on the shadow of a cruel stepmother and her two sisters. Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske, the film was produced by Walt Disney himself and has an experienced cast of voice actors, animators and a great soundtrack, created by Mack David, that earned three appointments for the Oscars in the categories of Best Sound, Best Soundtrack and Best Original Song (for the song ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"").Personally, I consider this one of the best films that Disney Studio presented before converting to digital animation. The film managed to capture the magic of the story and present it in the same way that we do for our children. The film exudes charm, largely thanks to the way the animals become active characters, assuming very human attitudes and characteristics, something that wasn't usual in the movies that time. Nevertheless, some characters were poorly designed, and the King is the most obvious case: he only cares about the need to have many grandchildren quickly, in a caricature of the importance that royalty give to the dynastic stability. This is the most negative review I do to this movie, that can easily make forget this little flaws at a glance.Currently, this film has been criticized due to the glamorous and very stereotypical way that presents the story. However, I consider this kind of criticism quite unfair. The mentalities has changed a lot since this film was shot. In fact, the story in which the film is based is also the honest but passive girl, far from pleasing the current feminism's of our culture of ""woman-warriors"", independent and sexualized. People cannot see this movie with the eyes of this time, but it does not remove merit to it."
44,Cinderella,8,29 April 2016,Disney icon,"After her father's death, Cinderella lives under her cruel stepmother Lady Tremaine and her two mean daughters Drizella and Anastasia as their servant. She is kind to the small animals as they avoid Tremaine's cat Lucifer. The King is impatient for his only son to settle down. He arranges for a grand ball so that the prince may choose a bride. Cinderella is eager to attend. Tremaine promises to let her go if she finishes her chores and find a dress. They keep her busy so the little animals help her fix up her mother's gown. However, the stepsisters destroy the gown and she's left behind. Her fairy godmother comes to the rescue but her spell will be broken at midnight.The subject is a little old fashion but it is still plenty of fun. Cinderella is more pro-active than Snow White. She is a compelling character. She is kind-hearted and hard-working. The animals add a lot to this. The first half relies heavily on the mice. The music is light and fun. The songs are memorable. It's an iconic Disney animation and loads of fun overall."
45,Cinderella,,4 December 2015,charming,"just charming. for the characters and atmosphere. for the joy and for old fashion shadows. for te magic and for innocent beauty. for the delicate colors and for the spirit of a fairy tale who becomes more gentle in Disney version. a film about love and friendship. and about miracle. seductive for the grace to translate emotions and inspire another. beautiful for the details. and for an universe forever green. because it is one of films who not only presents a story but inspire a state of soul. real gem, it is a meeting with small pieces from childhood. the romance, the tension, the ferocious cat and nice mouses. and Cinderella. like a spring wind. a film who could be new at the each new view. this is its secret."
46,Cinderella,7,20 August 2015,Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo! This quintessential rags to riches story was kinda cool.,"Cinderella is one of the oldest, best known, and most universal stories in the world. The bare bones of the story are mostly the same with the Disney version directed by Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske and Wilfred Jackson. The 12th canon film for Walt Disney Animation Studios, Cinderella tells the story a young noblewoman, Cinderella (Voiced by Ilene Woods), whom is forced to live with her crude & vindictive stepmother (Voiced by Eleanor Audley) when her parents died. Unable to get along with her step-family, they mistreat her by making her work as a servant. When the local prince (Voiced by William Phillips) holds a kingdom-wide ball, they refuse to let her attend, but she was able to go, when her fairy godmother (Voiced by Verna Felton) takes pity on her and outfits her for the ball. However, there is limit to the spirit's help: Cinderella must return by midnight. Can she win the heart of the prince or the limited time, be too much for her to overcome? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, the best known version of this story, is the one written by Charles Perrault in the 17th century call 'Cendrillion"". When you hear the name Cinderella, you think of fairy godmothers, glass slippers, and a pumpkin turned into a coach, you're thinking of Perrault. In the1950, Disney adapted Perrault's story into a movie, cementing it in people's minds as the 'truth' story of Cinderella. Not a lot of people know this, but this movie help save the Walt Disney Company from being bankrupt. At the time, Walt Disney Productions had suffered a big blow, when their European film market was cut off, due to the outbreak of World War 2. They were in debt, after high production films like 1940's Pinocchio, 1940's Fantasia, and 1942's Bambi weren't making a lot of money when they came out. Disney was limited to making collections of shorts while many of their staff were drafted to the war effort. It's Cinderella that save the company from bankruptcy. It's no wonder why the Cinderella Castle is one of the company's main logo. Since then, the popularity for this movie, has somewhat died down, as a lot of people saw the Cinderella story as alright at the time, but somewhat dated for the modern viewer. Then, you got those, modern viewers that really get angry, when you mention the name, Cinderella. Their beef against the film, was how the film is sexist, due to fact, that it portray women as hysterical servitude slaves who can only be rescue, by men or magical forces. I can understand, a bit, of what they were saying. Cinderella was indeed, somewhat a submissive and meek character, but she also has a fighter side. She did make a choice, to go to the ball, against the wishes of her crude Step-family. She did try to escape her abusive environment, toward the climax and despite the abuse and neglect she had gone through, she still remained kind and forgiving. Any normal person would have become cynical if they had gone through this, but she didn't. Yes, she got married at the end. But how does that make this movie less feminist? Being a feminist doesn't mean you hate men, so getting married didn't make her any less of a strong character. There is nothing wrong, with caring. I know that whole essays have been written ripping Cinderella apart, but those are some good examples of her being more than the submissive, servile archetype. Also is the Fairy Godmother really damaging to children, convincing them someone will solve their problems, or is she a symbol of hope? There has been many of brave, productive people that believe in higher powers, throughout history. I really doubt of any of them, were call fragile. Maybe we just need to admit we don't know the character as we think we do, and leave our interpretation of Cinderella up to the individual. However, this doesn't stop the movie, from having other faults; like how the movie is call Cinderella, but most of the screen time, is with the mice. Another is how Cinderella's looks win over the prince, over her personality. The two of them, have little to no chemistry. The film also fails to explain, how the magic works. Why doesn't the Fairy Stepmother step up and save Cinderella, earlier? Why does Cinderella's magic end at midnight? Why doesn't the glass slipper, disappear when the clock strikes midnight? Could Cinderella really the only person in the kingdom who the slippers could fit? These things, really needed some more exposition. Anyways, the animation is alright, but it definitely marked down to form, compare to the painstaking and extremely expensive animation techniques of the earlier films. The songs were pretty catchy. I love all of them, but some songs do go, way too long. The voice acting is alright, for the most part. However, the prince is the worst of them, all with his limited role. Glad, the movie nearly goes all Brother Grimm with the story. It never goes too gory. We don't see the stepsister's gruesome acts of self-mutilation of foot-binding and cutting off limps. Then later, them being blinded by birds. Still, I can wish, they kept the part of one that one of the step-sisters was slightly less mean than the other one. Anyways, parents need to know that this Disney classic is one that whole family can enjoy together. Even, if kids saw the film, they will likely already be familiar with Cinderella and her Disney Princess colleagues due to a massive marketing effort behind the ladies. Cinderella got not one, but 2 Directed-to-Video sequels: 2002's Cinderella II: Dreams Come True & 2007's Cinderella III's A Twist in Time. There is also a 2015 live action remake with the same name. Overall: while, not the best Disney movie, but it does have enough magic, to keep the magic going. Do recommended."
47,Cinderella,,18 March 2015,Cinderella 1950 Review,"Among Disney's repertoire of classic animated films, their adaptation of the Cinderella fairy tale is one of their most renowned. Even if you haven't seen it, you're probably already familiar with its whimsical magic, character archetypes, and symbolism.Disney's animation is a very short and brisk film, making it easily-digestible and accessible. About half of the film focuses on Cinderella, the country maiden who's forced into servitude from her evil stepmother and her daughters. These scenes can elicit a good amount of sympathy for Cinderella and gives her struggle a decent amount of weight. In between all this drama, there's also a bunch of cute little critters who go around helping Cinderella while dodging an evil cat. These Tom and Jerry style antics provide the comic relief and peril that kids may find most enthralling. And, of course, there are a few cute and catchy musical numbers.Unfortunately, because the film flip-flops between the main story and the animals so much, it comes off as a very thin plot. No background is really given to Cinderella and the ladies she lives with; any motivation behind them hinges solely on their emotional state (which is fine for Cinderella, who wants to break free of her bondage, but all the villains are just evil for the sake of being evil). Even less is said for the royalty - Prince Charming may as well be a literal cardboard cutout, and the King is just wacky. Everything else is filled in with the goofy mice and animals - they tend to steal so much screen time that could have been used on other aspects of the storytelling. Despite these complaints, the story is simple and elegant, and it gets the job done. It relays an implicit theme to the audience that ugliness can be more than mere looks, and grace and love transcend physical and social boundaries.This film boasts pretty good-looking animation. Most backgrounds are well-detailed and stylish. Character and animal designs are much more spartan, but are consistently interesting to look at. Designs for all the settings, costumes, props, and such are straightforward. Voice acting is pretty decent, and the writing is okay. Music is catchy, but not the most memorable of Disney tunes.Cinderella is rather uneven and thin, but it's a good-looking animation with a few decent moments, and it tells a simple story that's worth seeing. This film is worth seeing at least once, but 2015's live action adaptation provides a fuller and more well-rounded story.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)"
48,Cinderella,8,30 June 2014,Fairytale ending,"So, I just got Cinderella recommended on IMDb.Cinderella will become alive again next year in the cinema.This is the fairytale about the hard working girl Cinderella, and her evil step mom.The girl is singing about her dreams she wants to become true in the meanwhile.Later on the girl wants to go to the ball, but the villain comes in the way.Some of the sidekicks are the mice.The mice you can see sing every Christmas Eve here in Denmark on our annual Disney Christmas variety.This movie are having romance, thrills and lots of fun.Beside being an old cheesy fairytale the animation is striking.It have a lot of hearts and charm too.So, have fun with hunting this DVD or Blu Ray down.8/10"
49,Cinderella,8,23 July 2012,A movie for everyone who believes that dreams can come true.,"I remember watching this movie when I was a kid. I see this movie as quite a memorable and wonderful experience. Cinderella(Ilene Woods) is a young woman who was forced to be a servant for her cruel stepmother, Lady Tremaine(Eleanor Audley), and her two stepsisters, Anastasia(Lucille Bliss) and Drizella(Rhoda Williams). Later that night, everyone except Cinderella has gone to the ball. However, with the help of the Fairy Godmother(Verna Felton), Cinderella is dressed in beautiful clothes and meets Prince Charming(William Phipps). On midnight, Cinderella leaves the ball and leaves behind a glass slipper. When the Duke(Luis Van Rooten, who also plays the King) arrives at Lady Tremaine's house to look for the girl who won Prince Charming's heart, will Cinderella meet the Duke just in time to marry Prince Charming or will Lady Tremaine and her equally nasty daughters prevail? The music is absolutely dynamic and the character designs are absolutely great. Also starring James MacDonald as Jaques and Gus, Don Barclay as the Doorman, June Foray as Lucifer, and Betty Lou Gerson as the Narrator."
50,Cinderella,8,18 April 2011,Nice film,"May contain spoilers I never even saw the Disney version of Cinderella before so when I heard that they were releasing it from the Disney Valut I had to get it as I wanted to see what it was like.Cinderella tells the story of a young girl named Cinderella who lives with her evil stepmother Lady Tremaine and her ugly stepsisters Drizella and Anastasia. Cinderella has to do everything in the house from cleaning floors,to getting their dinner ready etc etc. One night Cinderella gets an invitation for the ball which is for the whole household. With the help of some (irritating rats that sound like the rodents in Alvin & the Chipmunks) help her get ready for the ball by designing a dress but the dress gets ruined by Cinderella's evil stepsisters and her mother. But that doesn't stop Cinderella as her fairy godmother transforms Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown and she goes off to the ball and a prince is enchanted by her beauty.You can probably figure the rest for yourselves but personally I may be 19 years old going on 20 but I am a sucker for fairy tales and animated movies(depending on what they are about). The story of Cinderella is very old-fashioned yet its a very romantic movie. This film is strictly for little girls aged 4 years of age who love dressing up as princesses and daydreaming about romance.Cinderella is a very enchanting flick. Check it out doesn't matter if you are a child or not watch it."
51,Cinderella,8,15 November 2009,Another one of Disney's classics-Dazzling,"Cinderella is a beautiful film, with beautiful songs of course. In fact, it's one of the best films of the 1950's.I think all the characters are portrayed amazingly. You can see the cruelness of Cinderella's stepsisters and her stepmother, the sweetness of Cinderella. The mice are funny and sweet too.I think they changed the tale a bit, but I think it's for the best. It's such a nice film, and I don't think anyone could resist it deep down.I give it a 8/10. I don't think it's the best Disney film. But it sure is a true classic."
52,Cinderella,8,16 June 2008,Beautiful.,"For quite a long time in my life, I either did not like this film, or I liked this film but not as much as many more. I watched it recently (at a sleepover, funnily enough) and I liked it more than I had done since I was under 6 or something. I now appreciate it more, as I do with a few other Disney classics that I have watched recently (including ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Pinnochio"" or however you spell it). I now very much appreciate the animation, the clever ""Disney"" plot turns, the humour from the mice, the emotions expressed and the plot. The animation is very well done, often it seems you are wherever the other characters are, watching them. The animation also does well portraying the styles of the backgrounds, including the town (which is shown twice briefly). Disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, injecting clever plot turns ,such as the mice making the clothes and the key part (usually I do not like Disney films very much if they are not that similar to the original story, but with this I am not overly bothered. I feel they made necessary changes to make this a good Disney film. Often I do not think Disney changed the book in a good way in some of their films). You know the story already, Cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters. She goes to a ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper...This is a film very much to be watched with other people. Immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend you watch it with friends (and immediate family, if you like. :-) ). I recommend this to people who like Disney at least a little bit, people who like fairy tales and for people who like mice. Enjoy! :-)"
53,Cinderella,1,7 May 2007,One of most overrated Disney films ever!,"I don't care if people bite my head off for this review of this Disney film or not, I'm just saying right off the bat: THIS MOVIE STINKS! I hate this movie and everything it stands for. It soooo overrated with people on this forum and in public pouring so much praise on this saccharine garbage. I don't even want to mention the plot (everybody knows it anyway). The movie is total rubbish and don't understand all the praise going towards this movie. Along with others like ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""The Aristocats"" and ""The Rescuers"". Great Disney movies are out there like ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Aladdin"" and ""Robin Hood"". So stop green lighting these films and go for the ones I said instead.1/10"
54,Cinderella,5,1 February 2007,Could have been more,"Yes, yes, it's cute, funny, a great visual, but the way the characters are used is very bad. The prince almost does not appears, the fairy godmother could have appeared in other scenes etc etc. ""Cincerella"" is the type of movie that, when the ""The End"" appears, you ask ONLY THAT? I found myself thinking that it could have a good 30 minutes more not being boring, but telling the story more interesting and detailed. If you see the DVD bonus material, you'll see some deleted scenes that could perfectly have been used with no matter. Songs are nice, colors are great, Cinderella is beautiful, but because what I have said, I don't like this movie so much. If you want a very well-told Disney's classic story, look for Snow White."
55,Cinderella,5,30 May 2006,A Dull But Still Popular Disney Effort,"This bland, tepid Disney cartoon remains one of the most popular animated films produced by the studio, but it has none of the visual artistry that distinguished the Disney style in its early days in films like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia."" ""Cinderella"" acts as more of a transition to the family-oriented Disney of today, that sacrifices artistry and content for popularity and merchandising opportunities.And, to top it all off, ""Cinderella"" has one of the most annoying soundtracks of any Disney film. ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,"" anyone? Grade: C"
56,Cinderella,9,18 March 2007,"Sweet, Timess Classic","This Disney animated classic sure does live up to the term, ""classic."" The characters here are well conceived, presented, and executed, as is the storyline, the premise, the tale, and the animation. This is among the oldest of Disney's animated feature-length films, and in my opinion, the older ones are the better ones. The animation quality is superior to the techniques used today, as are the scores.Cinderella is a personal favorite of mine, as it teaches you to hold onto your dreams, to ACT on them, and to have faith in yourself.This is beautiful, and definitely belongs in your Disney collection.It rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :."
57,Cinderella,,3 July 2002,More Disney Magic.,"Disney's animated ""Cinderella"" is another winner from the famed studio. The story is naturally about the titled character, a beautiful but psychologically abused young lady who has two cruel evil step-sisters and an evil step-mother. But she has a chance to get away from them and have her dreams come true with the help of her fairy god mother and some friendly mice. 4.5 out of 5 stars."
58,Cinderella,5,30 April 2016,The pinnacle of Disney mediocrity,"I call this strictly an average film because Cinderella is actually a mixed bag. On my + side, the human characters are strong, the magic works as well as the marketing boasts, and when the mice are actually important, they can keep the movie going enough to continue to watch it. The songs are overall average, with Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo being the only one I enjoyed. The rest, I could merely describe as sufferable. On my - side, I found Jackson, Octavius, and the other mice to have insufferably annoying voices, and when they aren't important to the Perrault plot, I couldn't stay awake. The mice get into all sorts of antics with Lucifer, distracting him to retrieve food, escape the castle, or other things that Cinderella has nothing to do with. The only scene of this Tom and Jerry clone that I enjoyed was the final one, not only because it meant an end to these ripoffs but also because IT WAS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO CINDERELLA'S PERSONAL STORY. The rest of them attempted to be like Tom and Jerry with more mice, but quality trumps quantity when it comes to the amount of mice you have against a cat. I don't know if I've been too harsh on it, but personally I would skip these scenes and leave remembering magic and important comic reliefs. Other than the mice vs. Lucifer scenes, this is decisively worth it."
59,Cinderella,5,5 January 2016,A pleasant Disney effort,"Cinderella is widely seen as an iconic film. Not only did its success help save Disney from financial collapse, but it also crafted some memorable imagery and established themes that would reoccur in Disney's fairy tales. Most people know the story. Cinderella is effectively a slave to her cruel stepmother and her chance to escape appears when every maiden in the land is invited to the Prince's ball in order to find him a wife. She attends, with help from her Fairy Godmother, and falls in love with the Prince, but leaves only a glass slipper behind for him to find her. I think the simplicity of the story is what appeals to people, while its themes of perseverance and triumphing over adversity are also used effectively.Cinderella herself is not the most interesting of characters, she's pleasant and sweet but she's also a little boring. Yet her kindness is what wins you over, the fact she's always so upbeat and optimistic in the face of such hardship makes her a very likable lead. Some people might have problems with how passive she seems at times, but it adds to the characters sensitivity for me. I also think Ilene Woods has a very gentle voice that matches the character flawlessly. Sadly the Prince gets even less development and comes off as a total bore. He only has a few lines of dialogue and we never know how he feels, he appears disinterested in the ball and as a result the romance with Cinderella just feels weak. The animation is excellent and softer which calls back to the likes of 'Snow White'. However, the most impressive thing about the film visually is its size. This is one big film with every castle and every mansion looking massive, in fact the scenes at the Prince's ball are amazing in scope considering the films ages. The colours are bright and bring a lot of warmth to proceedings, with lots of blue and pink that blend together beautifully with the background. The music is good for the most part and there are plenty of pleasant melodies that suit the films tone, while songs like 'Bibbidi- Bobbidi-Boo' are bouncy and enjoyable.Possibly the best element for me is the stepmother Lady Tremaine. She is comfortably one of Disney's best villains and it all comes from her having control over Cinderella. She comes across as calculating and spiteful, always looking to make Cinderella's life miserable with an icy glare and air of superiority. Eleanor Audley also deserves praise for providing her calmly sinister voice. The stepsisters are suitably annoying, though much time isn't devoted to them. The dress ripping scene is the perfect display of Tremaine's subtle cruelty and has a real emotion heft to it given Cinderella's reaction. Disney regular Verna Felton deserves credit for making the Fairy Godmother a caring and motherly figure for Cinderella.The biggest issue with the film for me is that there are far too many 'cute' moments, most of which involve the mice that help Cinderella. They aren't overly important to the story yet the film gives them ample screen time and all they do is slow down the main plot. They do provide some amusing comic relief at times, but there is simply too much time spent with them when it really should have been spend developing characters like the Prince. Lack of development is something of a general issue with the film, we never really know the true motivations of any of the characters outside of our main character and it does mean you struggle to get engaged in the story at times.On the whole Cinderella is a charming and enjoyable fantasy, yet despite its acclaim and iconic status I certainly don't think it's amongst Disney's best. The animation is spectacular in every sense, Lady Tremaine is a wonderfully evil villain and despite some flaws Cinderella is a pleasant lead. The voice actors all do fantastic jobs and the music is enjoyable as you'd expect from Disney. With that said it certainly suffers from a lack of character development, a flimsy romance and far too much concentration on the animal sidekicks which both harm the story. The memorable moments are worthy, but it just lacks something to be considered as one of Disney best."
60,Cinderella,9,13 October 2014,The classic that saved Disney,"Cinderella is arguably the most important full-length feature in the history of Disney. If Cinderella wouldn't have been a success, Disney probably wouldn't exist today. Why is Cinderella so important? Disney wasn't doing good business in the 1940's. The expensive productions of Pinocchio and Fantasia cost Disney a lot of money, while both films didn't do well at the box office. After the release of Bambi, which also didn't make Disney enough profit, the company decided to release a series of package films like Fun and Fancy Free, Three Caballero's and Melody Time. These films featured several shorts packed into one film. But Walt Disney soon realized the package films weren't going to get Disney out of financial trouble. A full-length feature, if successful, would be much more profitable. So Disney pulled the trigger and started producing Cinderella. It really was hit or miss for the company. Cinderella was finally released in 1950 and it saved Disney from disaster. Cinderella performed incredibly well at the Box office, grossing 85 million dollars. It received praise from audiences and critics alike. It's not hard to see why.Disney returned to its roots since Cinderella is based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. People criticized Walt Disney for his production of Bambi in 1942, stating that there wasn't enough magic involved. He made more than up for it with the release of Cinderella. That's arguably one of the reasons why Cinderella was much more successful than previously released films. Another reason might be the fact that Cinderella was released in 1950, while films like Bambi and Pinocchio were released during World War II, which cut off the European market for those films. Cinderella is a kind-hearted scullery maid in her own house. Her mother passed away when she was young, so her father married Lady Tremaine (voiced by Eleanor Audley), who has two daughters of her own: Drizella and Anastasia. After Cinderella's father passed away, her stepmother and stepsisters mistreat, abuse and humiliate Cinderella. Luckily, Cinderella has befriended a group of mice, who are the only animals that actually talk during the film. When Cinderella hears the news that there will be a ball in the royal palace to find a bride for the prince, she asks permission from her stepmother to attend the ball. The mice, led by Jaq and Gus (both voiced by Jimmy McDonald), find worn clothing from the stepsisters, while avoiding the evil cat called 'Lucifer'. The mice put together a dress for Cinderella, but when she wants to leave the house to go to the ball, her stepsisters destroy her dress. Cinderella meets the Fairy Godmother (voiced by Verna Felton) and she casts a spell so that Cinderella has a new dress and can attend to ball. She dances with the prince, although she doesn't know he's actually a prince. She must leave him, though, since the spell will be broken at twelve o'clock. The next day, the king sends the Grand Duke to try and fit a glass slipper, that Cinderella lost, on every girl in the city because the prince promised to marry the girl who fits the slipper. Lady Tremaine realizes the prince danced with Cinderella, so she locks her up in the bathroom. The mice manage to save Cinderella, she fits the glass slipper and marries the prince.This Disney classic is almost perfect. The animation looks rich and is perfectly crafted. In my opinion, the animation in Cinderella is as good as it was in Pinocchio and that's saying something. The songs in Cinderella are fantastic, especially 'Bibbidi- Bobbidi-Boo' and 'The Work Song'. They are catchy and are still memorable today. The characters are interesting, especially the side-characters. The king and the Grand Duke (both voiced by Luis van Rooten) get a lot of screen time and have a great deal of chemistry, which leads to some great comedy scenes. The mice are fun, Lucifer is great as the evil cat and Lady Tremaine remains one of the most cruel villains in the history of Disney. She's absolutely brilliant as the evil stepmother. Great performance by Eleanor Audley, who also did the voice work for another great villain in Maleficent. There's one flaw though. The Prince. He's incredibly boring and seems very unmotivated. He barely has any dialogue at all. He's perhaps the worst Disney prince in history. But except for the prince, Cinderella is a flawless film and was the right cure for Walt Disney. His company probably wouldn't have survived without Cinderella."
61,Cinderella,10,26 June 2014,What Fairytale Dreams Are Made Of,This movie is what fairytale dreams are made of... a beautiful damsel in distress waiting for prince charming to whisk her away to his palace! OK I admit it - I'm still a sucker for the film. This was a childhood favorite of mine and I still enjoy it today! I guess most young girls dreams of her price charming - and I was not one of the exceptions! I guess I'm still waiting my prince to this very day. LOL.This is the kind of film that couples should watch together in order to remember that he should treat her as his princess and she should treat him as her prince... to rekindle their romance (if possible).I still love this movie...10/10
62,Cinderella,8,15 May 2014,The weakest of the Walt-era princess films,"Cinderella (1950) was my favorite movie as a child. I would re-enact scenes as I watched it, dressed up like the titular character, and almost wore the VHS out. Watching it as an adult, I still get warm feelings of nostalgia; however, it is certainly the most bland of the Walt-era princess films.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Sleeping Beauty (1959) are both more ambitious and visually interesting. Cinderella was made at a time when the studio was (not for the first nor last time) on the verge of bankruptcy and they were starving for a hit film. As a result, Cinderella was made in the Snow White model and feels much safer. The songs are memorable and the characters are fine, though not terribly interesting. Unlike many, I find the mice grating comic relief. Fortunately, they are balanced out by the cold-hearted stepmother, among the greatest Disney villains.In conclusion, an entertaining film, but not entirely deserving of the amount of celebration it receives."
63,Cinderella,8,30 June 2013,Classical and A Soft Re-Telling,"I really did enjoy this movie when I was a child. It was great at such a young idea to believe in love at first sight. I also enjoyed the ideal that a girl who was worthless and nothing could become someone amazing and marry the perfect man.I didn't enjoy her singing voice, though. I thought the vocal actress for singing was too high, my ears are sensitive and high soprano doesn't float my boat. I kind of enjoyed the second Cinderella more, it was probably because I was overwhelmed by the original story. When I was young I read the Grimms version, with the cut off of parts of the step sister's feet to wear the shoes, and all the other gore, but Disney did a good job of making it nice. I preferred Dark though :P"
64,Cinderella,8,26 May 2013,Another childhood classic from Disney,"Along with 'Peter Pan' and 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Cinderella' was one of my favourite Disney films as a child. This film was engaging for the most part, but I feel that the announcement of the ball took longer than it should have done due to a somewhat overlong segment of Cinderella doing her duties and a couple of the scenes involving the king and the duke were slightly irrelevant to the film's main plot. The mice were hard to understand when I heard them speak for the first time in this film for several years but they were cute, funny and active supporting characters nonetheless. Also the film's location setting (probably a toss-up between France and the Netherlands) and time period are hard to determine. The ending was rushed yet memorable with some twists and turns leading up to it.The best aspects of this film were the prologue that consists of a moving back-story of Cinderella and her step-family; beautiful illustrations; very young versions of Cinderella and her stepsisters and simple animation, which got better as the film progressed; the memorable songs (In particular the opening song, 'A Dream is a Wish,' 'Sing Sweet Nightingale,' the brief song sung by the mice before they made Cinderella's dress, 'Bibbidy Bobbidy Boo' and the song that plays when Cinderella dances with the prince); the bubble sequence during 'Sing Sweet Nightingale;' the dressmaking scene and the Fairy Godmother scene. In conclusion, this film isn't quite as enjoyable as 'Peter Pan' and 'The Little Mermaid,' but it was worth another look after several years. 8/10."
65,Cinderella,,1 August 2011,Thoroughly enjoyable and enchanting,"During animation class today, our teacher decided to inspire us by screening Cinderella. Needless to say it backfired, because we were so entranced by the movie we stopped animating to watch it... And what a movie it is! Perhaps people who haven't animated before wouldn't be able to fully appreciate what a masterpiece of animation this is. While other studios were stuck on lifeless in-betweening and line moving, Disney animators have already worked out what gave animations the illusion of life. Even by today's standards, this is superb animation, and the beautiful thing is that you hardly notice! That's the hallmark of great animation- it feels so natural you don't notice it.I voted an 8 because, honestly, it's got a rather weak story, with little character development etc. But nevertheless, I can't say that it's a major flaw, the other aspects of the movie more than make up for this. The characters are charming, and the story felt as magical and timeless as I first saw it as a little kid all those years ago. The colors are perfect, the songs are very memorable and the voice actors fit their roles very very well.Overall I love this film, and I'm damned sure that kids are still gonna be watching this in the generations to come."
66,Cinderella,10,27 December 2010,"Cinderelly, Cinderelly. Any Girl Can Be A Princess.","a lot of people like to dismiss 'Cinderella' as a unremarkable Disney product, but those who do so obviously haven't given it enough thought or compared it to other hand animation.not only does 'Cinderella' feature some attractive 50's style animation and lush color design, it also has some of most skillful characterizations and storywork of all the Disney classics. 'Snow White' might be a better film, but the story and script and characters are done with more complexity and dimension. Snow may be sweeter and cuter, but Cindy seems more like a real person and not so much of a cartoon caricature. she also feels older and more mature than the somewhat tweeny Snow.the story also is scripted to elicit strong emotional responses from it's audience. to quote Disney historian Leonard Maltin, ""there are more scenes calculated to traumatize a viewer in 'Cinderella' than in practically any other Disney animated feature"". the scene where the stepsisters rip Cinderella's dress to shreds is probably bound to disturb some children more than the ""enchanted"" scares in the other films because it's a very real and human, and the sisters are human and not witches. also there is my favorite moment when the stepmother trips the Grand Duke, who is carrying the glass slipper, and the slipper falls to the floor and smashes to bits. i can remember being a child and being very taken aback by that moment.the color styling and animated special effects are some of Disney's most beautiful and striking. the pastel hues of pink and blue really define the film's memorable look. the sequence where Cinderella and the Prince dance out into the garden boast some amazing colored animation effects. when the fairy Godmother transforms the pumpkin into a coach is some of the most breathtakingly fluid and detailed animation i've ever seen. the images literally make your eyes move in all directions while viewing.and of course the songs and score, like most Disney classics, is charming. often music in children's films can make or break the film and turn the whole thing into a droning, sappy, sugary, kiddie mess. not with 'Cinderella'. the songs are nicely done and not a overworked hodge-podge of kiddie clichés.feminist have always claimed a problem with the Cinderella story. we've all heard the tiresome ""cinderella complex"" theory. there is something to that but really, you shouldn't let your childhood stories mess you up like that. i also present this alternative outlook to the story and film. first, in the original fairy tale, Cinderella takes revenge on the mother and sisters with hot coals on their feet and has the dove peck there eyes out. eek. second, in the Disney version Cinderella does not complacently sit there and wait for her princey. Cindy attempts to make her own gown and get there herself. if you know the Disney version, you know Cindy takes a lot of initiative. with apologies to Linda Woolverton, not everything is in need of a feminist twist.next to 'Snow white', this is my favorite Disney princess story. this cartoon has been with me all my life, and it still rings true for me to this very day."
67,Cinderella,7,18 September 2010,"Not the strongest Walt Disney-produced effort, but still another good family film","""Cinderella"" is a VERY famous fairy tale, and I remember it from my childhood in more than one form, but don't recall ever seeing much of this 1950 Disney movie version. I guess I was reminded of this film's existence from watching ""Enchanted"" last week, which is a parody/homage to the Disney princess movies, including this one. I have to admit, as popular as that comedy/fantasy flick is, I thought it was annoying, and it was the third 2007 film I've seen which I personally found to be an incredibly overrated turkey (the other two being ""Juno"" and ""Superbad"")! Still, I watched this particular version of ""Cinderella"" a little over a week later, expecting it to be a lot better than the hit 2007 Disney film, and I was not proved wrong.Cinderella used to live happily in a castle as the daughter of a widowed aristocrat who remarried to Lady Tremaine, a woman who already had two daughters of her own, Anastasia and Drizella. Sadly, since her father's death, Cinderella has been mistreated by her cruel stepmother (who never showed her true nature until after death of Cinderella's father) and spoiled stepsisters, who are jealous of her beauty. She is now forced to be the servant of the castle, but remains kind in nature and has many animal friends. One day, which appears will just be another day of chores for Cinderella at first, an invitation to a royal ball to find a suitable bride for Prince Charming is delivered. Lady Tremaine says Cinderella can attend if she finishes all her chores in time and has something suitable to wear. While the mistreated young woman has her animal friends and eventually a Fairy Godmother to help her get to the ball, her terrible stepfamily obviously doesn't wish for her to be the one who marries the prince! Watching this on DVD, I was very pleased with the animation, with some very nice backgrounds in the outdoor scenes. However, there were a number of things I didn't like about this adaptation of ""Cinderella"". It doesn't feature the greatest bunch of musical numbers in an animated Disney movie, and the film is off to a shaky start with Cinderella waking up and talking to her animal friends. The voice acting for the main character provided by Ilene Woods is also flawed, though it's not always bad. Her mouse friends provide comic relief, but I didn't find them very funny. I did find them mildly amusing at times, with them trying to get their food without getting captured by Lucifer the cat and such, but I've seen much funnier characters in Disney animation. With these gags, it takes a little too long to get into the story. Better comic relief in this film is provided by The King. Even though this character doesn't make as many appearances, he certainly made me laugh. The story gets more entertaining as it goes along, and most of the characters stand out, including the lead.During my childhood, I remember seeing part of an animated film featuring a cat named Lucifer, but didn't know it was this movie. Like I said, I don't recall seeing much of this particular Disney flick as a kid (unlike a number of other Disney animations, some produced by Walt Disney during his long career, like this one, and some made after his death), but I'm sure I would have enjoyed it if I had seen it all. Finally watching it from start to finish in my 20's, I felt I would have liked a lot of it better as a kid, including the scenes with the mice, but overall, I still thought it was a decent piece of animation. Also, I'm not sure haw many readers will approve of me saying this, since Cinderella is a cartoon character and this is a squeaky clean family film, but during my recent viewing of the film, I thought the main character was hot, which obviously wouldn't have been the case when I was a kid! Anyway, if you're a Disney fan, regardless of age, I can't think of any reason why this 1950 production wouldn't be worth watching. It's still an entertaining family film after sixty years."
68,Cinderella,9,14 August 2010,"The one that started it all, again....","The year of 1950 gave us three, perhaps four, great American movie classics. Mankiewicz's 'All About Eve,' Wilder's 'Sunset Boulevard,' and, yes, Disney's 'Cinderella.' There is also Huston's excellent, gritty 'Asphault Jungle,' a landmark in American Film Noir, but it cannot reach the cataclysmic heights attained by these three upon their individual releases. And while the remarkably similar, and yet strikingly different, former two films have received their accolades time and again from critics, there seems to be a hesitance to give this classic its dues. After all, its a ""children's picture."" What many don't seem to understand, however, is this film's significance. They don't seem to realize that although 'Snow White' ""started it all"" in 1937, without 'Cinderella,' the American public would not have 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Aladdin,' 'Anastasia,' 'The Lion King,' 'Monsters Inc.' or any other animated blockbuster cherished today made after 1950. Walt Disney, at the end of his financial rope, took one of his biggest gambles in producing this project ""about a girl in trouble,"" and it paid off, making it ""cool,"" once again, to go to see a feature length animated film. He was, in turn, able to produce the subsequent animated classics of the 1950s and 60s, and, perhaps, his live action ones as well.Most remarkable is the way every aspect of this film seems to flow together without interruption or flaw. This is a film that combines the romantic, almost neoclassic technique to be found in 'Snow White' with the more picaresque, bubbly quality of 'Pinnocio.' The Nine Old Men, each with his own distinct style of animation, were able to find a healthy medium so that their characters, different in appearance and mannerisms as they were, could all coexist on the same plane. To watch the Siskel and Ebert review of this film, in which both men have differing views on why this film is great, Ebert preferring the cartoon antics of The King & Duke, the Mice, the Stepsisters, and Lucifer, and Siskel partial to the magnificent realist approach taken to stepmother Lady Tremaine's design, is a testament to the film's versatility.Music, both song and instrumental, is as crucial to this film as it was to 'Bambi,' 'Dumbo,' or, even, 'Fantasia.' Instrumentally, it heightens the film's drama (ex. the dress tearing scene characterizing the sister's hate and Cinderella's confused heartbreak) and suspense (ex. the retrieving of the key from the stepmother's pocket). In terms of song, the team took risks and endeavors not attempted before, most famously with the 'Sing Sweet Nightingale' number, with the blending of Illene Wood's voices. More importantly, I find it an injustice that neither 'A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes,' nor 'Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo' were selected by the Academy to win the Oscar, surely either of these are more timeless than the song that was selected.The film's main point of criticism has always been its heroine. Soft and genteel, she is regularly dismissed as uninteresting and of not asset to the film. However, although Cinderella sports remarkably American qualities and values for a humble, French servant girl, she exhibits a sort of intelligence, perseverence, and creativity not to be found in Snow White, or, later on, Aurora. Cinderella's gutsy persona, that she was a rebel, was a source of pride for Walt Disney during and after the film's production. In the film's lead, we see the fabric that would lead to the creation of future model heroines; inquisitive Ariel, learned & feisty Belle, and heroic Mulan. If anything, it is the Prince Charming character who is objectified, and Disney's Golden Age can only sport Prince Phillip, and perhaps the Tramp or Bambi, as an interesting leading man.'Cinderella,' as a whole, has much to offer, not just as an animated film but as quality entertainment, just as timeless and worthwhile as 'All About Eve' or 'Sunset Boulevard.'"
69,Cinderella,10,15 February 2006,The classic fairy tale comes to life!,"Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is treated cruelly by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters. One day, a ball is to be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance of going, because her stepmother and stepsisters won't let her. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she is off to the ball, with the warning to return home by midnight. At the ball she meets the handsome Prince Charming. When the clock strikes midnight, she runs home, leaving behind one of her glass slippers. With the help of her animal friends, her true identity is revealed. She and the prince later get married, and they live happily ever after.Cinderella, released 56 years ago, was a huge box office success, and it continues to charm audiences to this day. It has a well-written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, including ""A Dream is A Wish Your Heart Makes"", ""So This Is Love"", and the great ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"", help tell the story. This was my favorite movie growing up, and it hasn't lost any of its charm. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The recent DVD release is the best way to appreciate this film, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music video, vintage radio programs, and a restored print of the movie!"
70,Cinderella,10,4 January 2006,Appropriate rendering Disney-style,"This is one of Disney's top five animated features, in my opinion. Cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length feature animation film (as opposed to the compilation films of the 40's), and expensive depth via the multi-plane camera returns to the film in no other way. Although Disney adapts the story somewhat liberally, you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizations---a clear time period the story takes place.Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multi-dimensional character. Actually, all of the characters are somewhat well-developed, except for the Prince--left the most flat--we know he has a sense of humor, and a great smile, but that's about all. Like Snow White, Disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culture---in most versions of Cinderella, the stepsisters are attractive, just not as pretty as Cinderella, and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance.Favorite Disney additions: the mice! Also, appreciated the continuity--Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film. The addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsisters was always horrific as a child--I remember View Master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it! The broken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil Lady Tremaine to give up her hold over Cinderella and admit defeat---Audley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all Disney villains, satanic witch Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty."
71,Cinderella,,20 May 2003,Cinderella,"Walt Disney takes the fairy tale ""Cinderella"" and makes it into a nice movie.The movie sees the young pretty girl Cinderella who is used as a slave by her evil Stepmother and two ugly step sisters.It's enjoyable, funny, even thrilling for young children with the touch of little mice being Cinderella's only friends, who help her survive her terrors. ***"
72,Cinderella,,18 July 2001,enchanting,"**SPOILERS** This is one of my favourites in the ""older disney classics"" section.With brilliant animation and songs including the catchy ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" and soothing ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" this movie is a winner.There are also memorable characters and excellent voice work from  the Stepmother,mice,cat Lucifer and King/Grand Duke.Cinderella is a lovely heroine,kind,persistent and strong-willed with good humour who calmly argues her point of view.The villain is wonderful in that she is cunning  with no magical powers,a similar characterized cat and a realistic appearance.The stepsisters are clever because their appearances aren't too hideous or revolting but their behavior says it all"
73,Cinderella,,20 December 2001,The Most Enchaning One of All,"Cinderella is my favorite Disney movie of all time. The music is great, the animation, and lets not forget the characters, I like Cinderella most of all, because Cinderella is like a drama. The setting is beautiful, and the music just makes it even better. My favorite sequence is the Nightengale sequence when she's cleaning the floor, although short that sequence takes the viewer inside Cinderellas mind, even for asceond. Until Lucifer starts trouble and Cinderella is brung back to reality (which she faces everyday). Another thing, although these parts only happen once in the movie, Cinderella coming down in the morning, the viewer gets the idea of what her life really is. She comes down, and starts the day off dreaming into her own fantasy world. Thats why Cinderella is so special. Sleeping Beauty has Aurora dancing in the forest, but thats all we would know about her, the viewer doesn't know what her life is like living in a cottage in a great forest, Cinderella reveals all these things, and thats what really gets the audience, captivation, mystery, and drama(the stepmother scene) Expecially the stepmother scene. I mean other scenes have the villain look terrifying by making them look grotesque or ugly like Snow Whites witch, but Cinderella has the stepmother be scary by her attitude toward things, shes strict and I dont know about anyone else but when I used to watch that part of the movie I was really into it, I mean all attention was captured by that scene. Cinderella is I think one of the best Disney movies."
74,Cinderella,6,16 December 2008,"Classic Disney, with All the Best and Worst","Cinderella is raised by her evil stepmother and two stepsisters, who make her do chores and essentially keep her as a slave after inheriting her father's estate. When the prince (with the prodding of the king) decides to throw a ball, Cinderella ends up going with the help of her fairy godmother and some lovable mice.The problem with criticizing ""Cinderella"" is that many of the criticisms aren't really related to the film so much as to the story it's based off of. Some feminists decry her reliance on a prince to save her from hardship (a common theme in Disney films). Others have the more general criticism that the film portrays women as little more than future brides with no life outside of her husband.You could also say that the film offers no real hope for those looking to it for inspiration. A girl in a desperate situation is saved at the 11th hour by a magical hag with a wand. Without her, Cinderella would be left to toil and the prince would have chosen some other girl to be the princess. In real life, no fairy godmothers exist, so I guess we are left to suffer on our own with little recourse.These concerns aside, the film itself is sound. The animation is great, and looks even better in the restored edition. I've heard some complaint that the ""dirty"" world of Cinderella is too clean, but I think that's really ignoring the fantasy element of the film. It's a simple but effective story, timeless. And the songs are now a part of our culture with good reason.I gave the film a fairly low rating because I don't think there's much about the film that pushed any boundaries. It really played it safe in every way it could. Don't get me wrong -- sometimes following the formula makes a good movie, and I think this is a good movie. But it won't get you recognized as one of the best movies of all time, certainly not by me."
75,Cinderella,3,15 March 2006,Not a guy's movie,"I'm a guy, so I naturally wouldn't appreciate this movie as much as others. I know that without this movie, there wouldn't be a castle in Walt Disney World - I've never been there; I've only been to Disneyland - but other than that, I really don't see what all the excitement is about.I do know that the same person who did the evil step -mother's voice is the same one who did Meleficent's voice in Sleeping Beauty"" This would be a definite ten, but like I said, I'm a guy, and the songs stay in my head and won't go away. It's very annoying.My score: 3/10."
76,Cinderella,8,31 December 2014,I think they made the most considering the subject matter.,"""Cinderella"" is among my wife's favorite Disney films and there is a lot to like about it. Although Cinderella herself is among the dullest characters (a problem with too many Disney princesses), the supporting characters are great. The step-mother is wickedly wonderful and Cinderella's friends, the mice, are delightful. It also is nicely animated and has some great songs that have lasted for many decades. But it also is not nearly as lovely to look at some of the earlier Disney films such as ""Bambi"" and ""Pinocchio"" and lacks their artistry. Additionally, my biggest complaint is that the subject matter is way, way too familiar. EVERYONE knows the story and there is little in the way of surprises. It's very good and is probably close to as good as anyone could do with the material."
77,Cinderella,9,16 April 2013,1st out of 8 in the Silver Era,"After spending most of the 1940s with package films, Disney was on turmoil with this last film and if it was successful, they would make more movies but if they were not, they would close the studio, and this film was a big hit in 1950.The story is about a young woman named Cinderella who has become a servant in her own home by her own stepmother. When the royal family throws a ball for Prince Charming's return, Cinderella sneaks out of her house to go to the ball, and unknowingly bumps into Prince Charming.The plot is not the most complicated, as it is practically the same as the fairy tale, but they perform it so well. The characters are also very interesting, except Prince Charming. Cinderella is a nice, genuine, spunky (for the classic princesses), level eased girl. Lady Tremaine is a crude, selfish, manipulative villain, who has so much impact in everything she is doing; great villain. The stepsisters are Lady Tremaine's pawns, but their foolish, bratty behaviour is hilarious. The King is extremely cold and enjoyable at the same time, but he does not come off as extremely threatening. Prince Charming is barely in the movie, and faces the same problems that Snow's Prince had (they could not animate a realistic male character yet). The mice are cute, fun characters that provide our comic relief.The songs, everybody remembers them, from ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"", ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Bo"", ""So This Is Love"", etc. they are so soothing, and not overly energetic and fast. Disney's most memorable songs are in this movie.The animation is top notch. It is so stylistic, and the backgrounds are so beautiful. Cinderella's design, as all the other characters (excluding Prince Charming) are designed really well, and Disney really got the character movements down. This is one of the best animated movies they have ever done.Everything flows well with this movie, and the only thing that I wish would have been better is if they took away some of the scenes with the mice, so we could have seen more of what the royals were thinking, but this movie is practically flawless.This film is perfect for the entire family. Little girls will like the dresses and mice, boys will love the slapstick humour, and the adults will enjoy the animation, story, and the undertones of the movies. You should definitely give this movie a look."
78,Cinderella,9,24 July 2012,The last great one before the decades long slump,"Cinderella is a wonderful film that makes you smile the whole way through. It has a lot of similarities to another Disney masterpiece, Snow White, but it holds its own. By this point, Disney fairy tales were starting to fall into formula, but Cinderella showed that the studio was still trying hard to pay attention to the details. The animation is perfectly smooth (yes, they rotoscoped most of the humans, but it still looks great!), the songs are uniformly excellent (Sing Sweet Nightingale being one of the best), the characters are developed enough to be interesting, and the business the animators give them to do is fun to watch. A critical choice the storytellers made was to give the animals voices (though the mice are hard to understand at times). Snow White's animals were all silent. Yes, the animals in Bambi could talk, but the story was about the animals. In Cinderella, the story is focused on the humans, but the animals still talk. By doing this, the animals become more distinct and their personalities shine more clearly. Disney would change that for their next princess story (Sleeping Beauty) and the animals would be silent again. Pity, because that was one of many reasons why that film was so dull. There is never a dull moment in Cinderella. We are enchanted, we are filled happiness. Disney would begin to cut corners in both story and especially animation after this film. They would turn out competent films that would make some money, but not really show the world what a great studio they were, at least not until 1989's The Little Mermaid and the start of the Disney Renaissance. But Cinderella reminds us why we love Disney films in the first place. Not quite as good as the masterworks of Snow White, Pinocchio, and Fantasia, but fabulous nonetheless."
79,Cinderella,8,1 January 2011,Nearly Perfect,"I can't call this a perfect movie, but it might be the movie that captures the Disney magic most fully. The story was one of the most beloved fairy tales already. What this movie did was add amazing visuals, which I credit largely to the stylings of Mary Blair. Her concept art give this movie and Peter Pan such a magical, dreamlike quality that they take me into their worlds every time I watch them. There were some sequences that were done so amazingly well I never tire of seeing them--the chase after the ball, the tearing of the dress, the dance with the prince, and the final sequence with the fitting of the slipper. I think some of the sequences that feel like filler involve the mice and the cat, and I also think the animation is on a lower level for some of those characters. The songs aren't the strongest, but do end up being memorable. The bottom line is that this is a movie that has kept its appeal for many, many years, and still brings the magic even today."
80,Cinderella,9,14 July 2009,One of the Greatest Disney Films Ever Created,"""Cinderella"" is a film about a young girl whose mother passed away and her father remarried. Once her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house, like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters. One day the King sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did. Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball, until her fairy godmother appeared. So she did some magic and made Cinderella into a beautiful woman, but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back. While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight, so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper. Then the King orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper. The duke searched every house, but finally found the women who it belonged to, Cinderella.Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated Disney films in 1950. This film is about a magical fairytale. In the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her, but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love.My favorite thing about ""Cinderella"" is the music. When Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a child, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so I will never forget it. I also loved the part when Cinderella and the Prince were singing the song So This is Love while they were dancing because they realized that they are in love. Overall this film was my favorite film when I was a little child because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale life."
81,Cinderella,10,24 January 2005,I LOVE This Movie!!,"***Might not consider this having a spoiler, but I'd rather be cautious than careless*** I never saw this movie when I was little. I fell in love with it the first time I saw it with my three year old daughter. I can watch it over and over again.For the little acting Ilene Woods did in her lifetime, she was a wonderful voice for Cinderella; very appealing; very believable. The music really fit the movie perfectly. The acting was great; loved the mice!! You really ""hated"" Lady Tremain and the step-sisters; they were just awful. The cartoonists depicted the spoiled behavior very well.This is a wonderful movie, especially if you are into love stories. My daughter has seen the movie about 25 times and still gets excited at the end."
82,Cinderella,,24 June 2004,"Not quite a full-blown classic, but still one of Disney's better efforts...","Personally, CINDERELLA seems a tad redundant... there's simply a few too many Disney features that concern a female title character who is ""saved"" at the end by some sort of Prince.  SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (1937) had already come before CINDERELLA (1950), and SLEEPING BEAUTY (1959) seemed like a ""greatest hits"" version of both movies.  And in the grand scheme of all things Disney, CINDERELLA, overall, is probably not one of the greatest features Walt oversaw (props should rightfully go to other efforts such as FANTASIA, SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO, BAMBI and DUMBO).  But before I get too stuffy about all this...CINDERELLA is still funny, charming and loaded with fun songs and absolutely superb animation.  If I only have one minor quibble, it's that the business between the mice and Lucifer the cat seem to take up a little too much time of the film.  If you have children, or are simply a fan of old movies or animation in general, no collection is complete without this.  It may not be perfect, but it comes closer than most animated films of today and is still a minor classic at the very least."
83,Cinderella,10,11 July 2003,A classic film for now and always,"Any child old enough to sit up in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this heartfelt and humorous re-write of the Grimms' fairytale.  They'll be singing 'Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo' before they can even formulate a complete sentence and will continue singing it till their dying days.  It is a classic for all children, especially those adults who are young at heart."
84,Cinderella,9,24 June 2001,One of Disney's finest,"Cinderella is one of Disney's greatest films, one of those films I think you appreciate more the older you get.  Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairytale.  I consider the film to have been the greatest of his films at the time of its release.  The characters became more dimensional than earlier films, creating more depth to appreciate the characters more. Cinderella herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters Disney ever created.  With her kindness and dash of dry humor, she is extremely likeable; however, it is the inspiration she provides which makes her memorable.  Like many people she is an endless dreamer, and she holds onto her dreams, never giving up.  Even in the most adverse of situations, her dreams endure, and she won't let anyone take that away from her.  Her example should serve as inspiration to everyone, and encouragement to never let go of your dreams."
85,Cinderella,4,6 March 2015,bippity boppity boo right out of my way,okay first off i am a girl locked in her attic with no parents and an evil step mother. My step sisters make me do all of the house work including cleaning their dirty bloody underwear from their periods. I think one of them even has an std or something. Im getting off subject now but lets talk about the movie. those rats are gonna give that Cinderella chick the plague or something i mean the chick has to be high or something talking to disease infested rats that will kill you with one bite its insane. this chick even makes clothes for them. imma start about the dress that all of the animals made first of all don't try it i sang to get birds to clean my room no i got bit at least 20 times and the rats most likely gave me rabbies. they didn't even make me a beautiful dress to go to prom in they just pooped all over the fabric and left me to find a fairy godmother. and if Cinderella's dress disappeared at midnight leaving her looking like she was attacked like a bear then why are her the glass slippers still there. like wtf its not okay and then the prince was to lazy to go looking for her himself like i would know the persons face if i saw them but no he had a freaking shoe tell if this was the girl or not did she have like baby feet because they went through the whole kingdom and did not find a girl with the same sized feet as her.this movie is a bad influence on children every where and you should all feel disgusted about yourselves.
86,Cinderella,4,18 July 2013,A true Disney classic,There have been so many versions of the Cinderella story that you may be surprised to find that some of the elements that you think are a part of the story are missing. Gone are Buttons and Barron Hardup figures that we see in Pantomime and instead we have a selection of cute animals (this is Disney after all) that will either warm your heart or annoy you badly.Cinderella herself is a typical Disney princess but the film moves along at a quick pace after quite a slow first 20 minutes. For it's age it looks stunning and the humour does not date.Although it probably appeal more to girls than boys there is a lot of fun for them to enjoy in the film as well what with the bumbling king and his servant.Overall a classic Disney film that is well worth seeing to bring back some childhood memories.
87,Cinderella,,10 November 2002,Another example of animated boredom from Walt Disney Pictures,"The truly best years of animation production at Walt Disney Pictures were while Walt Disney was alive but the horribly dismal results of this film gives an indication of how really bad it is over there today. There's just not much to keep ""Cinderella"" going in levels of interest as it is just an animated rehash of a story that has been filmed and written way too many times. This film's only highlight and mild levels of amusement comes from Gus and Jaq, Cinderella's two pet mice (these Walt Disney Pictures fairy tale adaptations usually add a couple of new characters in an effort to be more interesting and original). They provide this film's very few good moments with their antics."
88,Cinderella,5,24 March 2006,"Anyone remember the time on ""Gilligan's Island"" when Mrs. Howell dreamed that she was Cinderella and Gilligan was her Fairy Godfather?","OK, everyone knows what ""Cinderella"" is about, so I'll just talk about some things. I saw it 3 days ago for a class. As a 21st century 22-year-old guy, I'm not tempted to just watch such a movie and get transfixed. So, I threw out ""MST3K""-style comments. For example, when the birds wake her up at the beginning, I said ""Hey Cinderella! O.J. Simpson got acquitted!"".Now, whenever a book gets turned into a movie, there's bound to be some changes. And boy were there here! The Grimms' version of the story has the stepsisters mutilate their feet to try and fit them into the slipper. Charles Perrault's original story didn't have a Fairy Godmother; Cinderella planted a twig on her mother's grave and the tree granted her wishes.I like the ""Gilligan's Island"" episode where Mrs. Howell dreams she's Cinderella and Gilligan her Fairy Godfather. Speaking of the Fairy Godmother, would Cinderella's Fairy ""Godfather"" make offers you can't refuse? And of course, what of Cinderella herself? I assume that any heterosexual man's hormones would go wild just thinking about her, and any gay man would idolize her. And if her stepmother and stepsisters deprive her of everything, why does she always look like Grace Kelly? But this is Disney: the fact that she's so beautiful means she's 100% good, while the homely stepsisters are 100% bad. And there are Cinderella's mice friends. Maybe her friendship with mice affirms her isolation from society: people keep her locked up, she befriends animals. And let's face it, the mice are the underdogs the same way she is. The cat reminded me of Stewie on ""Family Guy"". I would call the king a cross between Archie Bunker and the characters whom Jack Nicholson plays in movies. The grand duke reminded me of Darrin on ""Bewitched"".Considering that ""Cinderella"" is the ultimate fairy tale, we need to think about the idea of a fairy tale. Fairy tales involve someone trying to make it (the American Dream). Not just economic success, but also the idea of going out and making the most of oneself. Thus, Hunter S. Thompson's life was a fairy tale! One more thing. The name Cinderella comes from the Latin word for ""ash"", because she's rising up from the ashes. I have to admit: when I hear ""ash"", I think of the ""Evil Dead"" movies. So, thinking of Cinderella's name, I picture Ash telling the ""primitive screw-heads"" about his boom-stick! Last but not least, I bet when the movie came out, the teenage boys really liked the scene where Cinderella's taking a shower (we see her backside). I will admit that she is pretty hot."
89,Cinderella,8,11 July 2005,Cinderella,"I had not seen this Disney classic cartoon based on the famous fairytale for several years, I probably only saw it a couple of times as a child, so when it was finally broadcast on terrestrial television I was not going to miss the opportunity to get a proper opinion at last. Basically in a small kingdom young Cinderella was the beloved child of a widowed aristocrat, the father married Lady Tremaine (Eleanor Audley) for a mother's care, she has two daughters, Drizella and Anastasia, from a previous marriage, Cinderella's father dies and Lady Tremaine reveals her true colours as a cold and cruel woman, she and her daughters take over the estate and reduce Cinderella to becoming a scullery maid in her own home. Cinderella (Ilene Woods) despite her mistreatment becomes a kind and gentle young woman, befriending animals who live around the château, including the mice and birds, but she cannot escape the ruling of strict Tremaine and ugly sisters Drizella (Rhoda Williams) and Anastasia (Lucille Bliss). Meanwhile at the royal palace, the King (Luis Van Rooten) and Grand Duke (also Van Rooten) organise a ball in an effort for the Prince Charming (William Phipps) a wife, word is spread that ""every eligible maiden"" is to attend, Cinderella wishes to attend, Lady Tremaine agrees she can, provided she finishes her chores and finds a nice dress. While Cinderella is called for more chores and work by the stepmother and stepsisters, her animal friends, led by Jaques (James MacDonald), Gus (also MacDonald) and the other mice, work together to fix a gown that belonged to Cinderella's mother, avoiding Lady Tremaine's wicked cat Lucifer (June Foray) they also manage to beads and a sash thrown out by the stepsisters. Cinderella is delighted by her new gown and comes down to attend the ball, but Lady Tremaine makes sure Drizella and Anastacsia destroy the dress, pointing out the apparent theft of the beads and sash, just as Cinderella is about to give up on hope her Fairy Godmother (Verna Felton) appears, using her magic wand to transform a pumpkin into a carriage, the mice into horses, her horse into a coachman, and dog Bruno (MacDonald) into a footman, and finally creating a new ball gown, with glass slippers. Cinderella is warned that at the stroke of midnight the spell will be broken and everything will return as it was before, at the ball Prince Charming rejects every girl, then he spots Cinderella in the distance, the two meet, fall deeply in love and dance alone throughout the castle grounds, then the clock starts to chime midnight, so Cinderella flees, dropping one of her glass slippers, away from the palace her gown turns back into rags, the mice point out one glass slipper is still on her foot. The Duke tells the King of the Prince meeting the unknown girl, the King is angered by her getting away, but the Duke calms him down telling of the glass slipper and that the Prince will marry the girl who fits the slipper, so the next morning a search begins to every house to find the girl whose foot fits the slipper, this news reaches Cinderella's household, the stepmother and stepsisters prepare for the arrival, and hearing Cinderella dreamingly humming at the news Lady Tremaine realises she is the girl dancing with the Prince, so she locks her in the attic. While the Duke arrives and Drizella and Anastasia try unsuccessfully with their large feet to fit the glass slipper, Jaq and Gus steal the key, Lucifer ambushes them, but Bruno chases him out of the window and Cinderella is freed, the Duke prepares to leave but Cinderella appears and requests to try on the slipper, but Lady Tremaine trips the footman causing the slipper to shatter on the floor. But then Cinderella produces the other glass slipper, to Lady Tremaine's horror, the delighted Duke slides the slipper onto her foot, fitting perfectly, in the end Cinderella and Prince Charming celebrate their wedding and live happily ever after. I was so happy that I was able to watch this again, I had forgotten so many moments in it, only remembering the obvious bits, the leading female character is lovely, her mouse and other animal friends are likable, the evil stepmother is sadistically sinister and the stepsisters are suitably irritating, the songs are delightful, the animation is fantastic, it will just make the family watching feel all warm inside, a terrific animated musical fantasy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for ""Bibbidy-Bobbidi-Boo"", Best Music and Best Sound. It was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 98 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!"
90,Cinderella,7,3 December 2016,Story Dull; Some Very Nice Songs,"I've never been as enamored with this film as with other Disney films. First of all, the villains just are laughable. They don't' have the cruelty that they have in other movies. The prince is a dud. He is strictly window dressing, someone for Cinderella to fall in love with. But the real downer is those tiresome mice and their electronically enhanced voices. After a few minutes of them, I've had enough. Even the Fairy Godmother is a dull, undeveloped character. Cinderella's plight in the original fairy tale is hell on earth. Here she is mostly inconvenienced. I know it's animation out of the fifties and Disney is for kids, but when I was young I didn't like this very much. Again, there are some really good songs, including ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes."" A theme for the whole Disney enterprise."
91,Cinderella,9,18 November 2015,One of the greatest Diseny film,"Cinderella is one of my favorite movie. when I watch this,it brings me back,when I was a young girl. and it made me want to keep on watching to know the ending. In my opinion, Cinderella is one of the greatest Diseny film with the beautiful songs.Cinderella is a story about the girl who lived with a step-mother and two step-sisters. she lived like a slave and suffered a hard life.when the step-mother and two step-sisters did really bad on her,I felt pitiful for Cinderella. And there are many characters in the movie as well. my favorite character was fairy god mother. because, she was the most helpful person in the movie. she could use magic. so, she could help Cinderella to join the ball. if she did not exist in this story, Cinderella would not be able to join the ball. And my favorite part of this movie was when Cinderella's foot fits on the shoes. so, the prince could know that Cindellar is the girl who danced with him.It was just fine for children to watch, not too scary and not too romantic. however, for the teenagers and adults, they could figure out the ending easily. so, it can be boring for them. I'd recommend this movie to kids, or young readers. because, it is a cartoon movie and easy to understand for them."
92,Cinderella,,9 July 2015,Tremendous comeback,"In 1950 Disney finally returned to full feature animations with Cinderella, one of their greatest comebacks to date. A film that quite literally saved Walt Disney Animation Studios and allowed them to continue shaping our childhoods.It's also the first fairytale film Disney had produced in a long time, featuring only the second Disney princess at the time of its release. A film of many returns and a film that helped to solidify what a Disney film was to mean.And it's a fantastic film in its own right. The animation is once again some of the best ever made, which must have been a true treat for the audiences at the time after a full half of a decade of nothing but shorts of varying quality. Here the quality is topnotch, though we still have a few films to go before Disney would once again start to push the medium forward with Sleeping Beauty.The story is of course a classic, and nowadays the version almost all think of when they hear the name Cinderella. Disney has always been at its best when it's doing adaptations, this being no exception. The best parts of the original fairytale are transformed into the silver screen experience we've all come to love.If I had to name one problem, I have to admit that the mice are a bit annoying now that I'm an adult. As a child I don't remember minding them at all, but now... Oh well, it's no like they ruin the film, so it's a minor flaw.Cinderella is an important film in Disney canon. It's also one of the better Disney films ever made. A true classic, and if for some reason you haven't seen it already, please do."
93,Cinderella,10,14 June 2015,"One Of The Finest Animation Techniques  I Have Ever Seen, Make This My All Time Favorite Disney Film.","Simply put: a masterpiece that will endure the tides of time. A fitting tribute to children all over the world by the hard-working animators that brought life to the colorful characters in the film.Even adults will enjoy this film. Cinderella, or The Little Glass Slipper (Italian: Cenerentola, French: Cendrillon ou La Petite Pantoufle de verre, German: Aschenputtel), is an Italian folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression. The first written version was published in Napoli (Naples) by Giambattista Basile, in his Pentamerone (1634). The story itself was based in the Kingdom of Naples, at that time the most important political and cultural center of Southern Italy and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the Neapolitan dialect. It was later reprised, along with other Basile's tales, by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps passé (1697), and by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales (1812). One of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written in French by Charles Perrault in 1697, under the name Cendrillon. The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of glass slippers.Plot: In a far away, long ago kingdom, Cinderella is living happily with her mother and father until her mother dies. Cinderella's father remarries a cold, cruel woman who has two daughters, Drizella and Anastasia. When the father dies, Cinderella's wicked stepmother turns her into a virtual servant in her own house. Meanwhile, across town in the castle, the King determines that his son the Prince should find a suitable bride and provide him with a required number of grandchildren. So the King invites every eligible maiden in the kingdom to a fancy dress ball, where his son will be able to choose his bride. Cinderella has no suitable party dress for a ball, but her friends the mice, led by Jaques and Gus, and the birds lend a hand in making her one, a dress the evil stepsisters immediately tear apart on the evening of the ball. As they depart for the ball, Cinderella is left behind. She goes outside and starts to weep, when suddenly a soft hand caresses her shoulder and she looks behind. She sees an elderly woman with a kind face who professes to be her fairy godmother. She immediately began to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turned a pumpkin into a golden carriage, mice into horses, a rat into a coachman, and lizards into footmen. She then turned Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Godmother told her to enjoy the ball, but warned that she had to return before midnight, when the spells would be broken. Watch this timeless classic to see what happens next...This animated film is based on Perrault's version of the tale. You immediately notice that the animation is very pleasant for the eyes, and the colors are rich and vibrant. The backgrounds and attention to detail is meticulous. The plot and script is well polished and perfectly adapted from Perrault's tale. Then we move on to the sound effects of the animated film. Again, excellence in the voice-acting, background themes and the few songs that occur in the film are very melodious. All the characters in the film are well portrayed and will linger in your memory long after you have watched the film.Other Walt Disney Classics: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio(1940), Dumbo (1941), Bambi(1942), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan(1953), Lady And The Tramp 1955, Sleeping Beauty (1959), The Sword in the Stone (1963), The Jungle Book (1967), The AristoCats (1970), Robin Hood (1973), The Rescuers (1977), The Fox and the Hound (1981)."
94,Cinderella,9,4 June 2015,The last of Disney's golden era,"Walt Disney's Cinderella, directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske, reinvigorated the House of Mouse's box- office power after the devastation of World War II, while at the same time marking the end of their 'golden era'. This was, critically, their final 'classic' film (although fans of Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) may disagree), and some of the art on display here is some of the finest animation Disney has ever produced. It also helped Walt Disney's huge ambitions, which was to take Disney to the new medium of television, bring children's dreams vividly to life by opening Disney World in 1971, and for Disney to become a global franchise in its own right.Cinderella (voiced by Ilene Woods) spends her days and nights tending to the many needs of her two bitter stepsisters, Drizella (Rhoda Williams) and Anastasia (Lucille Bliss), and her wicked stepmother Lady Tremaine (the wonderful Eleanor Audley, who would later voice Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty nine years later). When it is announced that the King (Luis Van Rooten) has organised a ball, inviting every maiden in the land to attend in a search to find a bride for his son Prince Charming (William Phipps and Mike Douglas), Lady Tremaine gives her blessing for Cinderella to attend. However, on the night of the ball, Cinderella's stepsisters destroy her dress, leaving her distraught and humiliated. But with the help of her Fairy Godmother (Verna Felton), she gets to attend the ball with the help of a pumpkin carriage, some mice-turned-horses, and a pair of glass slippers.The main draw of Cinderella, apart from the gorgeous animation, is the lead character herself, who is a truly sympathetic character and far less annoying that the usual Disney princesses. Tremaine and her daughters are truly ghastly creations, and their cat Lucifer - responsible for many laugh-out-loud moments as he tumbles with the mischievous residing mice - is no better. It's the plight of Cinderella that gives the film its backbone and emotional edge, rather than relying on musical numbers (though there are a few catchy tunes) and scenes of soppy romance, In fact, Prince Charming barely appears, but when he does it is short and all the more magical for it. It's also very funny, with the ensemble of animals on show providing many inspired comic set-pieces. Deserving of respect from both fans of animation and fans of classical film- making."
95,Cinderella,10,29 January 2015,Geeky Randy's summary,"Timeless fairytale of a gorgeous, smart and sweet young woman who was adopted by her abusive stepmother and demanding stepsisters after her father died and is used as their slave. But when her dreams are finally shattered and all hope for happiness is lost, her Fairy Godmother appears and turns the remains of Cinderella's dress into a new ball gown with glass slippersand when she is favored over other women at the ball, her stepmother sets out to hinder Cinderella's chances of marrying the prince. Bruno the dog, Lucifer the Cat and especially Gus the mouse certainly add an element to the already beloved story; and while the musical numbers are certainly not among the best to come out of the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, the songs are nevertheless fitting for such a wonderful and flawless tale.**** (out of four)"
96,Cinderella,8,19 December 2014,"All Politics aside, It's still a beautiful masterpiece.","The Moral of Cinderella, however you put it, isn't the most realistic moral. ""No matter how your heart is grieving, if you keep on believing, the dream that you wish will come true"".Cute, but that's not going to do Anne Frank any good.But I believe It's more about being optimistic; not so much, you get what you want because of Karma. The film is beautiful, exciting with interesting characters (I'm dead serious, Cinderella is a very interesting character).I don't care how many movies you've seen.That Climax is one of the most exciting of any Disney film."
97,Cinderella,7,23 September 2014,One of the most appealing fairy tale for girls.,"I think just every little girl or anyone that grew up listening to fair tales knows the story of Cinderella. It does give little girls the wrong perspective of marriage and all, but I can see why this movie can be enticing for a lot of girls and even women around the world. I actually like the secondary acts and characters of this movie. Even if Gus Gus can get annoying sometimes, but he atones for it at the end and sometimes that is what matters. Cinderella isn't a very standout character, nor do I think she is a strong heroine. And again it plays upon the Prince Charming saving her from all her struggles which includes her step mother and evil step-sisters. However when it comes to the overall package, it's actually a pretty good fairy tale movie from Disney. At least it's better than ""Snow White"", even if some may disagree. Even the musics are more memorable.7.3/10"
98,Cinderella,9,26 September 2012,Is it about love or family drama?,"When I was a young girl, I've always dreamed to become Cinderella and wear that wonderful sliver-blue gown. Cinderella has taught that if you keep on believing, your dreams will come true. Sadly, I've stopped believing and started to work on my dreams. It's a great movie, but the message is wearing off now a days.Let's talk about the main question... Cinderella gets to go into this exciting ball that was hosted by prince charming. Charming caught his eye one the girl in the sliver-blue dress and fell in love instantly. Sorry Charming, it doesn't work that way. And Cinderella fell in love too. The prince is braindead. He has no personality! He just has charm! He barley knew about the girl and he wants to marry her, but then he has every girl try on the glass slipper to find who is the girl charming danced with. Like are you kidding me! He's so braindead: what if a 50 year old woman fits into the glass slipper?? Charming is definitely going to regret that dance with Cinderella!Now I'm going to stop blabbing about how ignorant Prince Charming is and move on to the Tremaine family. So, Cinderella's real mom died, her father married Lady Tremaine. This new family is actually courteous and kind to Cinderella and her father. Well that changes years later. 4 ladies with a black cat and adorable mice. So Lady Tremaine and her daughter showed their true colors to poor Cinderella and they start to treat her like crap! What an exciting story so far! Why would a mother (well stepmother) treat someone in the family like crap? Doesn's she know it's child abuse? It's just so cruel of her! Cinderella just believes in her dream of falling in love with a bland prince and living happily ever after, but no. Family comes first! Cinderella is a movie about family disputes and how a family should not be! I wonder how the Tremaines will survive in the 21st century with all of these abuse prevention laws and the loads of security. But it's just family drama and Cindy is left behind.Sorry for my long, torturous paragraphs. I didn't realize it would take me this long to make my points. Otherwise Cinderella is a wonderful classic with the songs, drawings of the characters and the animals. I'm glad that I grew up with it. You have to wait for Cinderella 3 for Prince Charming to have a personality!"
99,Cinderella,9,22 March 2012,Enchanting.,"Walter Disney was not a great animator himself, but a great innovator and caterer to what people loved most about life, and the good things life has to offer. He made his films always with this regard at the forefront. From Snow White, to Bambi, Dumbo and all of the other classic tales that he lifted from folklore and history, and, like a deity of animation, breathed life into characters that were once trapped on pages in library books.""Cinderella"" is no different, and we see a gentle and simple tale of honesty come forth as the young girl who means no harm to anyone must overcome adversity aimed at her in the form of jealousy. An active attempt to keep her down and in her place as we see a contest of power among sisters in name only. There is almost a kind of Jane Goodall quality as we see the new matriarch push aside the offspring of the father's previous love so that her brood can benefit from the resources created by the previous marriage. Cinderella, the once much loved daughter of the household, is now relegated to servitude. But even here her spirit cannot be quelled. For in her labor lies love, and her friends, the various fauna that populate the household grounds and walls, keep her spirits up. She is isolated from people and society, but soldiers on.It is a basic story telling of how seeking consolence from another object of affection can adversely effect that which one loves; i.e. the father remarrying someone whose motives are less than altruistic. But, in the end, it is the stalwartness of the royal seneschel who knows only that his duty must be performed at the behest of the crown, for therein lies honor. And it is thus that Cinderella sees that her one moment to shine has been rewarded through an artifact of military etiquette.It's a lovely film to watch and see. There're no real deep messages, but the story reminds us that delving hastily into new relations where matters of the heart are concerned, can be perilous if the previous party has been wounded. But, it also shows us that it is trusting your heart that brings about, for lack of a better term, good things. It is a story that reminds us that opportunists may crush that which we hold dear, and unless a miracle is forth coming, the likes of which Cinderella experienced, bad things may continue to persist.Technical notes; lots of inbetweens to show us animation so smooth that nothing has been rendered like since CGI, and even CGI comes across as highly mechanical and precision oriented, a raw juxtaposition from the innate intuition of the artists who animate with gentle feeling. This is what makes Cinderella such a beautiful visual for us to sit, watch and absorb. I feel like I should have more to say, but, other than the fact that it's a wonderful film, I'm at a loss for words. Watch it, and enjoy."
100,Cinderella,9,28 January 2012,Bravo to Disney,"As a young boy, I always sort of hated ""Cinderella,"" since I was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what Disney movie to buy. I wanted ""Dumbo,"" but my sisters won out, and we got ""Cinderella."" They thoroughly enjoyed the movie while I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures.A lot has changed since then. My love of the Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World, and I now have two young nieces. I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched ""Cinderella"" together. With my newfound appreciation for all that is Disney, I watched ""Cinderella"" with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw.From the beginning of the movie, though, I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament. Why was she such a slave to her stepfamily, and why couldn't she just run away? I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming immersed in the story. Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listening to songs like ""Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo"" and ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" sort of whisked me back to the theme parks. I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring Cinderella Castle.Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney. That may make many people scoff, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like Cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about. The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Tinkerbell - embody why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world.While ""Cinderella"" may not be the strongest story, it is sort of iconic in Disney and movie history. It represents that fun, idealistic, and fantasy-like wonderment we held when we were kids. I imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many, many people out there. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it does represent all that I love and admire about the Company.My IMDb Rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)"
101,Cinderella,6,28 December 2011,"Interesting, good story, meh ending","I'll admit up front that the story was pretty good, the songs were good, the comedic jokes were fine and all. But the ending seemed to lack. First off, there was no final battle between Cinderella and the evil step mother... one minute the slipper inspectors are about to leave, the next Cinderella comes down and ends up with a perfect match. Then she's married, the end. What happened to the step mother or the two daughters? No dramatic ending.Oh well, I did enjoy the humor with the cat and dog (the cat may have died?) and the mice were also entertaining. But all in all the movie wasn't bad at all. Rated 6/10, almost 7 but the ending seemed unsolved."
102,Cinderella,4,4 November 2011,Great Movie!,"I hadn't watched Cinderella when I was younger but recently I did and I loved it! I think its so different from the ordinary Disney film...well i heard it's not even Disney so I guess that's a given. But the characters looked different and it has some really nice songs. Especially the first one ""This is my idea"" which speeds things up from when they're kids to when they're older...its really cute and the song itself is nice. Also its not the typical old animated films where the guy and girl fall in love straight away since they kinda dislike each other when they were young. But after that they just have this beautiful love which is both happy and sad and perfect!! Other than that, far longer than forever is a great song, along with many others. Tons of funny characters - Cindrella's friends, who are good funny friends are hilarious as well as the shoes's adviser and his friend. Anyway love it!! A must see classic."
103,Cinderella,8,24 March 2011,Stays very true to the original story,"An other reviewer says that Disney's Cinderella stays very close to the original story and I have to agree with that. I don't think any other Disney fairy tale stays that true to their origins. What Disney does is merely elaborating on the story and adding some helpful animals (especially mice) so Cinderella is not that alone in her duty to face the evil stepmother and stepsisters. I remember reading a Cinderella version where she did get help from birds, so maybe that idea wasn't fully copied from Snow White. The whole story is executed as it should be with a few extras but I must say the movie is kind of lacking in the humor department. It only becomes a bit funny when the mice are in it. The rest of the movie is serious and dramatic. But that's just how the real fairy tale is, pretty dark and dramatic. That doesn't take away the animation is splendid and the magic when the fairy godmother shows up is fantastic. Long had I waited to see this movie for the first time (over 12 years old), not because I disliked the Cinderella story (in fact I love it) but I could not think a fairy tale with so little action (most takes place in the house) could actually make a good movie. I was wrong there. Even if I liked its sequels more I think this one deserves an 8, my only complaint that it lacks humor but I cannot find any faults in the storyline or its execution. I might not have liked it that much first time around but this one needed re-watching to make it grow on me and it did."
104,Cinderella,7,15 August 2010,Quite good.,"I don't have many deep thoughts on Disney's return to feature length narrative animation. To me, it doesn't rank with the best of their work, but it's a very entertaining and charming movie with some excellent animation, music, and characters. What is most fascinating to me is the atmosphere around its release.After most of Disney's golden age masterpieces proved to be financial disasters, and after WWII had led to a focuses on cheaper productions and serving the war effort, Cinderella came about when the whole studio was in need of a hit, or else it would go under. Thankfully, it proved Disney's most resounding success since Snow White, another princess fairytale, and allowed Walt to break into television and, of course, his fascination with a certain theme park.It's not hard to detect that the film was made in more more desperate times for the studio, with its overabundance of rotoscope (quite a bit of live-action footage was shot even before production began) and animation which, though lovely, isn't as lavish as Pinocchio's or Fantasia's. Though I had issues with the rotoscope in Snow White, it bugs me less here since it's not as literal, and the work on Lady Tremaine is legitimately imposing. Unfortunately, the design work on the humans is pretty bland overall.Which is why we must be thankful for the myriad side characters who help Cinderella in her goal to become one of the godless, gluttonous aristocrats. Ward Kimball does a lot of funny stuff on the mice and birds, and Marc Davis has a few standouts too. However, it's Milt Kahl's work on the Fairy Godmother that steals the show. While Kahl usually detested work on human characters, he's clearly having a ball with this one, playing with her facial mannerisms and drapery to give a real sense of fun to the character. Bippity Boppity Boo may be an overexposed number, but her interaction with the effects and other characters in that scene is so enjoyable that I still love it.The plot is pretty boring. She wants the guy, her evil family won't let her get with the guy, her friends help her work to get the guy, she gets the guy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't matter when so many great scenes populate the film. Overall, I think the early fifties is a weaker period for Disney feature animation (though there were fabulous side projects like Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom) but this still shows why they could whip up an entertaining movie even when the conditions were problematic."
105,Cinderella,9,16 September 2009,Give me Jaq and Gus over any outspoken Disney hero any day.,"When it comes down to fairy tales, Cinderella was the one that made you cry the most. poor Cinderella is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave-driving step-mother. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, We got to witness Cinderella in animation.Before the story begins, Cinderella and her father are lonely, and rich beyond their needs. to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sisters, Cinderella's Dad marries a woman, but then dies soon after. the stepmother, only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step-daughter, Cinderella.So for many days, Cinderella is a slave to her step-mother and her step-sisters. she has hope however, thanks to her friends, the mice of the home (sounds like Cinderella wasn't playing with a full deck.) she has hope that one day she'll find her prince. the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend.9/10"
106,Cinderella,10,19 June 2008,Greatest Disney movie ever?,"Worry not, Disney fans--this special edition DVD of the beloved Cinderella won't turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight. One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the Disney-fide adaptation of the gory Brothers Grimm fairy tale became a classic in its own right, thanks to some memorable tunes (including ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,"" ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,"" and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. The famous slipper (click for larger image) We all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. There are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderella's rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer. There's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke. It's a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying."
107,Cinderella,9,11 January 2008,Makes you a child again,"I don't think I need to tell you the story. For it has been told for years and years. So I will just share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella was when I was five years old. From then on I was a Disney child in a good way. The animation now seems childish and old fashioned, but that is part of its charm now. Now, in the age of High School Musical and computer generated images, it seems like people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early Disney movies. Thankfully I was born before that so I was introduced to this classic. And it seems no matter how old I get, I turn back into that five year old watching it on VHS. Which is the true magic of Disney."
108,Cinderella,10,11 October 2007,"A sweet, enchanting masterpiece from Disney","The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites from Charles Perrault, along with Sleeping Beauty which was also made into a Disney film in 1959. I thought this film is a sweet, enchanting masterpiece from Disney.The film has a great soundtrack and that's one I like in a movie is a very good soundtrack. Also I love the songs too, my favorite song is the romantic ""So This is Love."" I love the mice from the film too, they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the narration, the little birds tried to wake Cinderella up in the morning. And I also love it when Cinderella's animal friends (the mice and birds) fix up Cinderella's birth-mother's dress so she could go to the ball, until Drizella & Anastasia tore it to bits, the b****es!"
109,Cinderella,10,19 September 2006,Greatest Love Story Ever,"Cinderella In my opinion greatest love story ever told i loved it as a kid and i love it now a wonderful Disney masterpiece this is 1 of my favorite movies i love Disney. i could rave on and on about Cinderella and Disney all day but i wont i ll give you a brief outline of the story. When a young girl's father dies she has to live with her evil step mother and her equally ugly and nasty step sisters Drusilla and Anastasia. Made to do remedial house chores all day poor Cinderella has only the little mice who scurry around the house and her dog Bruno as friends. When one day a letter is sent to her house telling all available women to attend a royal ball. Cinderellas evil step mother and step sisters try to prevent her attendance Cinderella finally gets her dream and wish and is able to attend her captive beauty , Genorisity and beautiful nature help her win her prince."
110,Cinderella,10,30 July 2006,A great masterpiece - don't miss it!!!!!,"First off, I want to say, ""Thanks, Disney, for finally releasing the ""Cinderella"" movie on DVD! Now you have all the Disney animated films on DVD (including the 1999 Limited Editions)! What are you going to do next? You're going to Disney World!!!!!"" Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle!!!!!)Anyways, Disney remains magical in his 1950 animated classic film ""Cinderella,"" the movie that put fairy tale movies on the map. We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her stepsisters, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just for saying ""Bippity- boppity-boo!,"" and of course, trying to head home by midnight!What I like about this film: It's a grand old fairy tale that children like, now in a movie form (as well as on DVD as well)!!!!!""Cinderella"" - thank you, Disney!!!!! 10 stars."
111,Cinderella,10,27 November 2005,Absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece,"In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the stepmother (voice of Lucille La Verne) was truly diabolical. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping, Cinderella (voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful lady. To me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it."
112,Cinderella,8,28 October 2005,"""Happy Birthday""","I know all the critics of this movie, most of them women's libbers or the such who hate a woman being rescued. But switching the focus to the passive Cinderella to more interesting animal side kicks was ingenious. I recently watched it again after probably 20some years and was entertained by the subtle perks I am sure I missed as a kid. What was most entertaining and enlightening was my 2 year old daughter sat spellbound throughout the entire movie, a feat that has not to this point been accomplished with modern movies. If I have any complaints it would have to be the songs. Other than Bibbitybobbity I want to cram something into my ears to prevent the sappy made for movie music from lodging into my head like a tumor. Disney has taking a dive into the tanks lately and a classic like this just drive the point home."
113,Cinderella,10,24 October 2005,This kind of movie have great educational influence on all generations.,"Comment? Like my comment is necessary? We are talking about all time masterpiece, for all seasons and all generations. This is only type of movies that i still have patience to watch. In this, like in other Disney's movies is some kind of magic. All characters are in some way, ""alive"" and ""real"" so it's easy to understand message, even if you don't understand language, (like i didn't understood when i first watched movie, because i was about six years old). Maybe my English is not so good, but i learned what i know mostly from this kind of movies, and this is one more great dimension of this kind of movies, which in present time are rare. But there is a one big shame. In my country is now impossible to watch this, or any other Disney's movie! We don't have copyrights, so our children are disabled to enjoy and learn from this kind of movies. So, we will watch this movie again ""Once upon a dream"" or...?"
114,Cinderella,,2 July 1999,"Great animation, sure.  Great film?  Hardly.","""Cinderella"" was one of the breakthrough films of its time, with some great animation work.  However, I hardly see it as a ""classic fairy tale"".  It's certainly not a very inspiring story.  What lesson does it teach?  Stick around through suffering which you have no right to suffer, and your fairy godmother will come and save you.  If you're going to show it to your kids, try waiting it out a bit until he, she, or they are old enough to distinguish between fantasy and reality.  That, or hope that you're a darn good parent."
115,Cinderella,6,22 May 1999,"Nice, but forgotten?","I can't believe no one has yet commented on this film, so I feel it my duty to be the first. This isn't one of Disney's best films (in my opinion), but holds it's own and is quite a beautiful story. With the mere fact that no one has yet commented on it shows how little of an impression it has on the general public today. Still, I believe anyone who thinks of Cinderella today thinks of mice, birds, and a plump and jolly Fairy Godmother; many of the elements first introduced by this delightful film. In addition, it spawned some classic songs like ""Bibbity-bobbity- boo"", and ""A dream is a wish your heart makes."" I think my favorite part is the mice singing their ""we can do it"" song while making a dress she can wear to the ball. I believe this movie was the first to introduce the concept of having two lovable side-kicks that the kids could relate to and enjoy: Gus and Jack (Aside from perhaps Thumper and Flower from Bambi). Disney realized the success of this much later and now include these types of characters in nearly all their animated movies. All in all I give it a 6½ out of 10, but respect it for what it is: A classic story that Disney made timeless and unforgettable."
