0,A Cat in Paris,8,16 October 2011,Sur les Toits de Paris,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film: in one sense it's an animated spoof of a classic thriller genre, in another it's a charming entertainment -- and it contains a very well observed cat! Like the B-movies to which it nods, it packs a vast amount of action into its 65-minute running time, leavening action with humour (the splatted dog is a classic cartoon gag -- but it's a tribute to the emotional realism of the film that later on the audience was actually worried that it had come to serious harm) and parody with genuine feeling: the gangsters discussing food are a homage to Quentin Tarantino, but the bereaved Jeanne's battles with the cartoon-Costa of her imagination put a quiver in my stiff upper lip. And the clambering up and down the face of Notre-Dame is a pure paean to Paris... and to the Hunchback! There are two apparently separate stories going at the start: the little girl with a workaholic single mother, plus the night-time adventures of her cat. But neither of them is quite what it seems -- the neglectful mother in particular is a much more sympathetic character than we initially assume -- and both strands rapidly intertwine with a gangster thriller plot. This may be an animated adventure, but it has more than enough depth for adults as well as children: in fact, I suspect the tension may be a little too much for small children. One little boy in the row in front of me had to be carried out howling that he wanted to go home.The style of animation is -- deliberately -- extremely crude: characters are drawn in the simplest of outlines, although I noticed that the cat movement and postures, for all the crudity of the shapes, were extremely well done. (Take the scene, for example, when the cat is sprawled in Nico's room -- or when it disdainfully opens just one slit of an eye as Claudine rages at it!) And almost all the action takes place at night or by artificial lighting, heightening the child's storybook appearance of the art. This is clearly a consciously retro aesthetic: I was amused to note that the brand of paper used in making all the drawings got its own entry in the credit listing at the end of the film.What really grated on me, for some reason, was the depiction of the feet (I had the same problem with DreamWorks' Sinbad animation). The characters in this film have incredibly tiny triangular feet which seem always to be drawn from the same angle no matter which way the rest of the body is pointing, and I found it visually disturbing to have the perspective so obviously all wrong...A bonus feature was the fluent idiomatic English translation in the subtitles, at least in the London Film Festival version: it makes a welcome change from translations obviously aimed at the American market. (And it's always fun to back-translate the insults: within the limits of my vocabulary of French vituperation, some pretty apt equivalents seemed to have been chosen!) I'm tempted to rate this at 9 out of ten, but I don't think it has quite enough depth for that level: I'll compromise and knock a point off for the annoyance of the feet, leaving it at a very solid 8."
1,A Cat in Paris,8,2 November 2012,Simplicity in itself,"A Cat in Paris is touching, uplifting entertainment for the young and old. The young will like it for its extreme simplicity, in contrast to many bombastic, whiplash-inducing animated films of the last decade, and the old/older will appreciate it for its beauty and sound.Prior to its Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, A Cat in Paris, or Une Vie De Chat, its French title, was seldom seen in America. Its animation style is gorgeous and instantly flashed me back to the big, colorful storybooks that were one of the dominant factors in my youth. The scenes look to be lifted directly from a large picture book, with its colors mixed and warm and its characters appearing like simple human-beings. I expected a watercolor style similar to Chico and Rita, another Best Animated Feature nominated from 2011, which had a heavy emphasis on character detail and environment artistry. A Cat in Paris seems more concerned with the environment and how it appears and feels as a whole, rather than the detail of it.The film revolves around a young mute girl named Zoé, who lives with her workaholic mother named Jeanne and her black cat. Zoé feels constantly in a competition to get her mother's attention, and is in dismay when she reacts in anger to her collection of dead lizards brought home by the cat. Unknown to both Zoé and her mother is that their cat lives a double life; he assists Nico, a local jewelry burglar, in his late night heists. The cat sneaks out in the middle of the night to return home soundly the next morning and wind up in Zoé's arms. One day, Zoé, the adventurer she is, decides to sneak out and follow her cat to see where he goes, despite the cat's protest. The cat winds up leading her into a mess involving gangsters, searching for a rare, expensive statue. The result is a cute, lively cops and robbers film providing goofy laughs and delightfully whimsical material.The jazzy soundtrack is instantly lovable, the action is in short bursts and surprisingly fluent, the animation is easy on the eyes, and the fifties look and feel is all present. A Cat in Paris is a film of low-key charm, beautifully rendered images, and a series of lovable little nuances all captured within a slender fifty-eight minute runtime. Perhaps, due to its shadowy effect and gorgeous style, you could refer to this as ""animation-noir."" Voiced by: Dominique Blanc, Bruno Salomone, Jean Benguigui, Bernadette Lafont, Oriane Zani, and Bernard Bouillon. Directed by: Jean-Loup Felicioli and Alain Gagnol."
2,A Cat in Paris,8,19 February 2012,A nice film for the whole family,"Even when ""A cat in Paris"" isn't at the same level of animated masterpieces as ""The Triplets of Belleville"" or ""Persepolis"", certainly it is a much better film for the whole family than most of the awful stuff produced by Hollywood in the recent years.The animation of this film is neat, with a great atmosphere and beautiful sceneries. Also, even when the character's designs seem to be quite simple at first sight, they are actually quite stylish and well made.The story, without being spectacular, never fails to entertain, keeping a good pace from beginning to end.While this film is clearly aimed to kids, I think that the adults will find ""A cat in Paris"" to be quite enjoyable, mostly because it is a way more mature and sober movie for the family viewing."
3,A Cat in Paris,8,23 March 2012,A Cat in Paris,"I found A Cat in Paris to be a very good film. Although it is rather short, perhaps too short, it is very well animated with ethereal colours, beautiful sceneries and a fantastic atmosphere that is both thrilling and nostalgic. I agree however that how tiny the feet were drawn was a form of annoyance. The music was both haunting and charming, almost like listening to a score by Bernard Hermann. The story is not the most original story in the world, but I didn't see it as a bad thing, seeing how slickly paced, vivid, affecting and humorous A Cat in Paris was. The characters also engage, with the best being the title character, a strutting observant sort of cat, and the little girl who is sweet and moving, and the voice acting is dynamic enough too. In conclusion, a very good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
4,A Cat in Paris,9,6 January 2012,Animation still lives in Europe,"As a big fan of anime, I got quite disappointed over the years as the European animation was slipping away, bit by bit eaten away and replaced by the Disney mass production. And just when all hope seemed to have gone, ""Une Vie De Chat"" arrived, bringing new energy and life.I liked this anime, I liked it a lot, and there is a good reason why. A single mother named Jeanne, employed in a Paris police force lives a lonely life with her daughter. Zoe lost her father, the mother is hardly around due to work, and the only bright spark of her day is the company of one black cat. But Zoe is not the only friend this kitty has got. Soon, a mysterious stranger will enter their lives, and together they will face a dangerous task...However, the real eye candy of ""Une Vie De Chat"" was the animation and the atmosphere it delivered. Drawn in an almost naive manner, the characters, surrounding and overall visual expression was truly beautiful and mysterious in a very special way. Seeing this anime is quite a different experience than you'd expect from a cartoon and it fits all ages, both kids and adults. It reminded me quite some of ""Amelie"", with a unique visual description of Paris and it's unforgettable charm.I like to be pleasantly surprised, and ""Une Vie De Chat"" is by all means the best surprise I could get. There is still some soul and creativity left in the European animation. It's a must-see for all true fans of anime. Good job!"
5,A Cat in Paris,7,29 January 2012,"Nothing revolutionary, but quite pleasant","The least familiar of the 2011 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, this is a French film (originally just titled A Cat's Life) made with traditional animation. The style is similar to some other recent foreign animated features like The Secret of Kells and Persepolis, with a lot of exaggerated backgrounds and simply designed characters (sometimes they even look like figures from Picasso's cubist period). The best thing about the film is its beautiful use of colors, which are truly stunning. The film is always a joy to look at. Story-wise, though, it's nothing too special. It's a basic crime film spoof. The titular cat leads a double life, living with a young girl during the day but venturing out with a cat burglar neighbor at night. The girl's father, a police officer, has recently been killed by a gangster, and now her mother, also a police officer, is on the gangster's trail. Eventually the girl, being chased by the gangster, is aided by the cat burglar. The villain is pretty dull. In fact, most of the characters are pretty uninteresting, with the possible exception of the burglar, whose nimble acrobatics are fun to watch. It doesn't even run 70 minutes, though, so its pleasures definitely outweigh its flaws by the end. It's well worth checking out if you're an animation fan."
6,A Cat in Paris,,11 July 2012,Cute Cat,"Having most recently been seduced by Paris in The Artist and Midnight in Paris and before that in animation with The Illusionist and Triplets of Belleville, I was fully prepared to enjoy A Cat In Paris, a nominee for Best Animated Feature Oscar, worthy of the award even with competition like Chico & Rita. I was not disappointed.This cute, un-Pixar thriller depicts a cat accompanying a cat-burglar at night over the rooftops of Paris and into apartments ripe for the plucking with his accomplice, Nico (Bruno Salomone voice). The owner of the crafty cat, Zoe (Oriane Zani), lives with her chief of Police mother Jeanne (Dominique Blanc), both of whom are still mourning the loss of dad/husband at the hands of arch-villain Victor Costa (Jean Benguigui). The plot does not make this a memorable cartoon; it's the whimsical slit-eyed, long-nosed eccentrics who inhabit the flat pastel world, slim on speech and graceful even when they're thugs. It's a fantasy of our imagination, what we dream Paris would be like in a better world, even with burglars and mobsters.An interesting touch is to make the cat tough rather than tender and Zoe mute for the shock of her father's death. The tonal shifts between that darkness and then silly thugs and a sweet cat burglar, who doesn't seem to be punished for his crime, will make this a problematic choice for kids, who might not get it. Parents may find it difficult to decide if this is a thriller or a comedy as well. For me, it's just the exotic world of Paris in my imagination. Nothing beats swinging over the rooftops at anytime with anyone, even a mischievous cat."
7,A Cat in Paris,6,9 April 2012,Another nice looking French animated feature,"French animation has a certain stylish aesthetic. From the Gallic influenced 'Pink Panther' and 'Inspector Clouseau' cartoons to the films of Sylvain Chomet such as Belleville Rendezvous and The Illusionist, French animation has a definite look and feel. A Cat in Paris very much fits into this category. Its appeal lies almost exclusively in its French aesthetic.Its story has three plot strands: a single mum and her daughter, their cat and a burglar and a gang of crooks. All the stories ultimately converge. In all honesty the story and characters aren't especially interesting. This is the weakness of the film. However, its strength lies in its animation and look. It's an old-style cartoon done in the traditional way. It isn't CGI and this is to its benefit. It has lots more heart and soul than the slick computer generated stuff we mainly see nowadays. The characters are simply drawn, resembling some forms of primitive art. The Paris they inhabit is beautifully presented. This city is such a knockout that it always looks terrific when animated, it really seems ideal for the treatment. Here is no exception, with the buildings lovingly depicted and the night-time rooftops romantically illustrated. The atmosphere created by the animation is very appealing.This is a good feature. It's not up to the standard of Sylvain Chomet's work but it is certainly operating from a similar place. If you appreciate traditional animation or more specifically French animation, then this is a feature well worth catching."
8,A Cat in Paris,6,17 September 2012,Surprisingly satisfying entertainment for a short film,"At 70 minutes, ""A Cat in Paris"" is the little film that could. The hand-drawn animated film packs a surprising amount of action and pathos into a children's cartoon and weaves a fairly rich back story that lends heft to the battle that unfolds between a cat burglar and the cat he shares with the local police chief versus the leader of a ring of art thieves. Leave it to the French to give the older child target audience some real narrative meat to chew on - although the action can be a little rough at times and some scenes will clearly scare younger viewers. The hand-drawn animation technique amplifies the scare factor but equally amplifies the warmth factor with scenes of the Dino the cat (and cat burglar)sinuously jumping from Parisian rooftop to rooftop approaching art. While the film is mostly beautiful to look at there are some plot problems such as the movie never stopping to explain how the older, puffy antagonist can keep up with our experienced cat burglar and his feline accomplice step-for-step across the Paris skyline. Also, action scenes too heavily dominate the run-time so at times it feels like Mel Gibson action movies from the 1990's. In short, the brief run time and a lack of memorable characters recommend it to a rental rather than a $12 a kid multiplex visit but it is a charming little film."
9,A Cat in Paris,8,17 April 2012,Visually haunting and plenty of laughs,"Will it change my life? No. Did half the cinema laugh out loud on several occasions? Yes Did I look at my watch during the film? Not once Will I remember it? Definitely the visuals, maybe not the plot Will I recommend others to see it? I already have Did anything annoy me (even the way feet were drawn)? No Did I come out smiling? Definitely Were the characters well-drawn? Cat yes, little girl yes, gangstas rudimentary (but fun) mum, a bit of a cliché but who cares Plot? Serious novelists don't need to feel threatened but it hung together nicely within its own parameters. So... a rather sweet film, funny, uplifting, eye candy, feelgood. For serious film buffs? Depends how seriously they take themselves. I defy anybody not to enjoy this movie. Oh, and I hope someone repairs Notre Dame."
10,A Cat in Paris,6,12 June 2012,Cute little film but that's it,"French cartoon about a cat that lives with Zoe a little girl. But, at night, he helps a cat burglar out.I caught this at a film festival last year. It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and it was perfect in that respect. The kids in the theatre seemed to love it but the adults (like me) were underwhelmed. The animation was OK and it was pleasant but the plot was dull and I was bored long before the 70 minutes were up. How this got nominated for an Oscar is beyond me. Must have been a slow year for animated films. Kids might like it but not adults. I've got nothing else to say but IMDb says you must have 10 lines of text to get published. I give it a 6."
11,A Cat in Paris,6,17 June 2013,Aesthetically arresting funbyte,"A charming, if somewhat trite, tale about the night life of a pet cat, Dino, who wanders off every evening, where he leads a second life as a partner in crime for an extremely elastic burglar. During the day he accompanies the mute Zoe, having lost her will to speak after the abrupt death of her father, murdered by villainous art thief Costa. Both her parents married into the police force, so now her mother, Jeanne, places great focus on pinpointing and capturing the elusive and ruthless crook.The odd, yet arresting, traditional animation are extremely stylish, visibly marking the specificity of French animation, seen also in similarly caricatured human drawings of Sylvain Chomein (""The Illusionist""). Drawings are kept simple, yet layered, with well animated figures, inspired by unique lack of symmetry oft found in children books, not by the strive for perfection of Walt Disney animation. Whereas the throwback-style of animation brings about a sense of unique charm, the story itself really doesn't venture into any unknown territory, instead delivering a well-mannered simple tale, which - unfortunately - does not always seem suitable for children given the simmering brutality (dogs being squashed by large bricks or a surprisingly direct level of aggression in the final act) and the drastically building tension levels in the second act. Nonetheless the entertainment value, significantly enhanced as an ode to the old-style heist genre, makes it an enjoyable affair, just as long as expectations keep the audience very close to the base ground level: just enjoy, don't analyse.Well-paced with a decent amount of action, after a more muted, restrained beginning, the voyages of a French cat thoroughly engage, leaving a level of satisfaction, not hampered by the overall triteness and familiarity of the whole affair. Naturally, French wouldn't be French without homaging and referencing other movies, hence the feel of old Closeau and Pink Panther movies is omnipresent."
12,A Cat in Paris,8,18 November 2012,A Unique nominee for the best cartoon award,"Alongside Chico and Rita, this is another worthy contender for the Oscar best animation category. Unlike most other animation, this is uniquely European in terms of art and of both the physicality and the expressions exhibited from movements to geometrics and color contrasts.I believe that, concurrently with choosing such an art style, the intention is to make the whole movie slightly more one-dimensional and maximizes the potential in that regard. The plot is meant to be simple and the characters being as predictable as it should be (villains are bad & stupid, etc.). Despite being too crude or lacking advanced perceptions which would obviously boost up the script's potential for a far richer content, there is still enough entertainment value, material and the pace of the plot is quick enough to keep demanding viewers like me hooked. In fact it is superior to Chico & Rita in terms of that. Some of the scenes are very creative too. I do hope either this or Chico will win the Oscars 2012!!"
13,A Cat in Paris,3,5 November 2012,What a disappointment,"For an Oscar nominee (!), this is pretty weak stuff. Yes, the hand-drawn animation is nicely done but -- at least in the English-language version -- the writing is just awful; over-explanatory and on-the-nose. I was constantly annoyed by it. In addition, the characters all have either American accents or *SPOILERS* British accents if they're bad guys. And the voice work is nothing special. I *would* be interested in seeing a French-with-subtitles version if one exists. Also, there's almost nothing particularly ""Parisian"" about the film, despite the title, except for the climax which takes place atop Notre Dame. And it's barely over an hour long! Glad I caught it via On-Demand rather than paying 12 bucks in a theater."
14,A Cat in Paris,8,11 July 2017,Very Intriguing and a Thrilling Experience,"I was surprised after watching the film, It kept me attached to the end. This is a story of a Cat who has two characters: The Cat accompanies a girl named Zoé while her mother is busy with her police work. And also he wanders in the night with a thief.A captivating and thrilling experience I never expected from a movie. This is worth an Oscar Nominee."
15,A Cat in Paris,9,5 May 2015,"Beautiful animation and design, gripping story and excellent voice-work make this film a joy to watch","This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Feature, losing to Rango. There will be spoilers ahead:This is a very short feature, clocking in at roughly 64 minutes and that includes credits. It's essentially a crime drama/mystery and the plot and pacing is excellent. The animation is beautiful, as is the design. It works for children and adults.The basic story is that of a police detective, her daughter Zoe and their cat Dino. Zoe's dad wad murdered by a criminal named Phil Costa and her mother, Jeanne, has sworn to catch Costa, even as she's trying to catch a cat burglar and protect an art exhibition. Zoe hasn't spoken since her dad died and is cared for by a nanny named Claudine.The first twist to the plot is that Dino has a double life-Zoe's cat by day, companion to the cat burglar, Nico, by night. There are some magnificent scenes showing Nico and Dino pulling off a heist and escaping. The visuals are incredible in these night scenes. Dino the cat weaves the various plot lines together as the several characters and story lines start to intertwine themselves. I won't discuss any more major plot points because it is, after all, a mystery.There is a running gag of sorts involving Dino and his penchant for stirring up a small yappy little dog named Rufus. It's funny and entertaining, as Rufus can be annoying but has lots of determination and stamina! This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray. It looks beautiful on either format. Most recommended."
16,A Cat in Paris,6,13 November 2014,"A good first time watch, but second not so much...","The first time I watched this I was quite pleased. It didn't bring anything fresh or new, but it offered a fun enough plot and good visuals to boost through these flaws.But then, I watched it again. Sadly, I just wasn't as interested. Now, I enjoy watching some movies more than once. This isn't one of those movies. It feels even less fresh than the first watch! I really wanted to have a rewatchable but short French animated film, and all that's missing is the ""rewatchable"" part.The thing that kept me from stopping halfway through the second watch was the animation and my raw urge to finish it.In conclusion, A Cat in Paris is a good first time watch. If you are looking for a caper with good animation (but no good 2nd time watch), I advise you to watch this. Better than average. 6/10"
17,A Cat in Paris,5,2 August 2014,Surprisingly mundane.,"I've been an animation lover all my life. You could even say I prefer it over live action. However I have been a little disappointed that pretty much all American animated films have turned to CGI and turned down traditional styles (I have nothing against CG animation, I just like verity).However tradition hand-drawn animation still thrives in Europe and Asia. Sometimes I even find some great gems like; The Secret of Kells, Ernest and Celestien, Metropolis, and Studio Ghibli. But one film in particular was a real white elephant and this the film I'm talking about today.I first heard of A Cat in Paris a few years back and ever since then I've been wanting to give it a watch. The film eventually found it's way unto Netflix and I gave it a sitting, my reaction; MEH!At first I thought the movie was going to be really charming; A cat that has two owners; 1) a traumatized girl named Zoe who won't talk and 2) a cat burglar. I thought the contrast between the two worked so well and eventually the cat will bring them together and they will have a cute little friendship. I spoke way to soon.The real story is about a boring police man hunt for an insane crime boss who killed Zoe's father. It wouldn't be so bad it the villains weren't the most clichéd humorous baddies you'll ever see. This guy is supposed to be a ruthless crime lord who murders cops. But the movie portrays him as a male version of Cruella Deviel. If this guy is Cruella Deviel that means his henchmen are Horace and Jasper. They do lame recycled slapstick comedy, talk like they have dementia, and say stupid one liners. So yeah this movie turned into something I was hoping it wouldn't be like.However the movie wasn't without it's good moments. For one; the animation was good a fluid and the art style was really unique. The fore mentioned Thief and the girl were good characters but they still needed more development. Overall I feel A Cat in Paris is a failed attempt at an underrated classic."
18,A Cat in Paris,8,28 February 2014,An artistic independent French animation with the right amount of poignancy and suspense,"I stumbled upon this film right here on IMDb when it recommended this title for me due to having looked at the information given for the 2010 film 'The Illusionist.' I then watched both trailers, one in French with English subtitles and the other in English and they looked stunning. Upon watching the English dub of the film, I enjoyed it slightly more than the trailers since I got more out of it although there are a few problems such as the film being a little too short for my tastes, the story being a tad complicated and the dubbing sometimes seeming off.The animation is artistic and vibrantly coloured if flickery and a tad choppy in places but it is impeccably cel-shaded and I liked the effective white line-drawing animation against a black background towards the end. The backgrounds are equally as vibrant and are also well-shaded - I especially liked how Notre Dame Cathedral and the Eiffel Tower were realised. The English-language dialogue was over-familiar in parts but delivered the occasional true-to-life line that I would respond to in relation to my pretty mediocre life at the moment while the voice acting seems unusual with a mixture of British and American actors but it is clear and well-projected nonetheless. The incidental music is jazzy, beautiful and suspenseful at the right moments. While the story is, as I mentioned, hard to follow in parts, it has the right amount of moving and tense moments with a subtle hint of joy. Moving onto the characters, Claudine and Nico are endearing, Zoe's mother is stern yet affectionate and Zoe herself is sweet, even though she didn't start speaking until the second half of the film and the cat is equally adorable.Overall, this French independent animated film is on par with the majority of similar titles I had seen ('The Illusionist,' 'The Old Lady and the Pigeons' and 'Ernest and Celestine') and a notch above 'The Monk and the Fish.' 8/10."
19,A Cat in Paris,8,18 January 2014,animated thriller to watch in family,"This one is for all your family. Classic thriller caper for adults with some fine references to classic movies (waoh the allusion to Night Of The Hunter and others). And a nice cat story and big laughs for the kids, and of course, they will ask you a lot of questions for a passionate discussion.Action, mystery, caper, violent gangsters, love story, a child in danger and many visual surprises : a cinematographic mirage.I found Une Vie De Chat real magic, everybody smiles at the end, it doesn't cheat on. Bravo.Yes, french cinema is still alive."
20,A Cat in Paris,,21 October 2013,I don't get it - good story plus ugly drawings = mediocre film in my books,"Hard to review this film. If it's supposedly aimed at kids, the subject matter is fairly dark with a dead father, a single mother obsessed with work and finding her husband's killer, some betrayal, some really obnoxious bad guys and a charming lovable cat. The story is interesting and despite all the loose ends and unanswered questions it leaves, it held enough of my interest and entertained my eight year old.But the ugly drawings - ugh. Reminded me of Beavis and Butthead. On the one side, they work hard to have some decent looking backgrounds. But the characters look like Picasso rejects. Don't know why they went with that style. I found it distracting and annoying. My 8 year old's drawings have more art and substance in them.Being such a crudely drawn film I am perplexed as to how this film could have received an Oscar nomination for Animated Film. Was there nothing else that year? Nothing at all? 5/10"
21,A Cat in Paris,,12 October 2013,"Loved it so much, I watched it twice","A simple story, almost cliché, but nicely done. The story has a well done form. The execution is beautiful. You have a little bit of everything here without making a mess. I loved it. And I loved it even more after seeing the bonus track with the other versions, more dark, more violent. It succeeds at making a child movie which is fun to watch for an adult. And it can be considered an adult light story that can be seen by children as well. A wonderful depart from the big budget animations from DreamWorks and DisneyPixar. So history seems to repeat itself. You have the big budget, nicely polished, yet silly and pointless Cars. And you have smaller, apparently independent European movies like this one. Bravo!Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"
22,A Cat in Paris,9,22 March 2013,The movie was an awesome movie!,"I noticed that the robber (Nico) was actually a good guy. Nico saves the little girl (Zoe) from Costa who killed Zoe's father. The nanny thats watches Zoe is actually on Costas side. In the end Nico kills Costa and saves Zoe. Because of Nico, Zoe talks again and because of Nico the mother and Zoe can be together again.And they all live happily ever after. My opinion of the movie was that it was a great movie! it keeps you at the edge of your seat and you never really know what is going to happen next! I would recommend this movie to all of ages From 10 to anyone older than that! The Cat in Paris is the best animated movie i have watched in awhile!"
23,A Cat in Paris,6,19 October 2012,France's stylized answer to The Rescuers,"The curse of our modern times is that everything seems to reference something else...very few films are truly original any more. That being said, A Cat In Paris is nicely done and a pleasant way to pass about one hour with your kids (realistically engaging for ages 6 to 10). Certainly, it will do you all some good to see old-fashioned animation once in a while in our computer-generated world.Plot: Girl gets kidnapped by crime boss who wants to use her to steal something valuable. Some animal friends set out to rescue her, leading to some spectacular chase scenes and heartwarming moments. Along the way, a few more animal friends help them..will they manage to save the girl? Will the criminals be brought to justice? Grownup's view: Once I realized where I'd seen this story before, everything fell into place; change the two mice to one cat and his cat burglar friend, and A Cat In Paris is basically The Rescuers with a few minor differences in plot elements and a major location change. But what a change! I'll take a wild chase or two among the midnight rooftops of Paris over the Bayou any day. Those ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" moments were definitely the best sequences of this film.Visual: The really original thing about A Cat In Paris was the animation style, which is...well okay, it's somewhat a homage to the art of Pablo Picasso. It's a bold choice, and since I can't recall the last animated film that paid tribute to Picasso, I'm calling this ""original"". The movements of the characters do seem uniquely sinuous here and there, and it is an especially fitting way to animate cats and cat burglars.Cynic's angle: Honestly though, the critical acclaim and the awards for ACIP baffle me. Are we so starved for something different from the last decade of wisecracking, slickly-dressed ""kids"" films, that we pounce on anything that doesn't smack of Disney and proclaim it great? (only to find that indeed, it was much like Disney's old formula anyway..)Yeah, I feel that way myself all too often.Conclusion: A the end of the movie, we had all enjoyed it, but not enough to watch it again. If I'd bought this at current retail I'd have been a little annoyed because it was so short..recommended for an on-demand viewing."
24,A Cat in Paris,6,24 February 2012,Nothing to get too excited about.,"Thing that these little, European, animated movies always have going for them is the fact that they are unique to look at. They have a visual style and atmosphere of its own, that is being quite different from any of the animated movies, coming from the big studios. And this is probably the only thing that this movie still has going for it really.Sorry to say but this movie really isn't much special. Story-wise it's all a bit too familiar and it doesn't has enough excitement or originality to offer. This feels like a typical animated movie, for kids to watch early on a Saturday or Sunday morning. So it's still good and enjoyable enough all but just nothing special really. It's not a movie that will stick to your mind, for a very long time.Visually it's a pleasant movie to look at but again, it's nothing that special really. The animation is actually quite simplistic, which prevents the movie from ever doing anything groundbreaking or impressive to look at. The movie does still have a couple of stylish and artistic moments in it but unfortunately the most impressive thing to look at are still its end credits.I'm not even all that sure about it if this is a movie all children will enjoy. There are some comical moments in it but the story itself is lacking some real excitement and isn't always that interesting to follow and to keep your interest, let alone that of young children. But luckily it's only an hour short movie, so it also never starts to become a boring or one, or anything like that.Good enough but really nothing Oscar worthy.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
25,A Cat in Paris,7,16 July 2012,Lives of a cat,"The cat in Jeanne's house is not just the family's pet. As night falls over Paris, the feline goes looking for adventure, pairing up with Nico, a burglar, who has a knack for breaking into homes while the people are asleep. A dangerous occupation, indeed. Zoe, who is Jeanne's daughter, is overseen by a nanny, an older woman whose real identity has not been exposed. To complicate matters, Jeanne, a police detective, is pursuing a criminal, Victor Costa, who is responsible for her husband's death, something that has left little Zoe unable to utter a word.Costa and his gang are after the Colossus, a statue with whom the gangster identifies and would like to possess. One night, little Zoe goes after her cat, after it goes in one of the nightly rounds following Nico, the burglar. She discovers a world of danger lurking outside the security of her home and is befriended by a kind Nico. Zoe discovers the duplicity of her nanny who works closely with Costa and his gang. Jeanne and the police go after Costa, getting in a final confrontation that will pay off two ways, the apprehension of the evil man and the miracle of Zoe regaining the voice she lost.A surprising anime from France, ""Une vie de chat"" is wonderful in the way it tells a story with animation. Directed by Jean-Loup Felicioli and Alain Gagnol, the film will delight adults and children. The dialogue is by M. Gagnol and Jacques-Remy Girard. The artists behind this project succeed in the way the story unfolds on the screen as well as the choice in the casting of the characters. Dominique Blanc is heard as Jeanne. The great Bernadette Lafont is the evil nanny. Bruno Solomone gives life to Nico. Jean Benguigui is the evil Costa and although she does not speak until late in the film, a sweet voiced Oriane Zani makes a good Zoe.An enjoyable animated film for all ages."
26,A Cat in Paris,7,19 February 2012,"beautiful animation, boring chase plot","The only reason you should see this movie is the beautiful art/animation. Colors and scenarios are gorgeous but the plot is quite boring, old and basic, its just one chase after another. If anything is worthwhile in the script is that there's no moral implications, not everything is merry and bright with the ""good"" characters; but we can account this on the film being french. Far from the political-correctness from USA animations.The main character is a cat, that bonds a little girl to a jewelry thief. But there's also a big-time mafia leader that the girl's mother investigates restlessly, making her an absent mother that can't spend much time with her daughter, traumatized after her's father death. Everything comes together with this 4 characters in the streets of Paris and the church of Notre-dame."
27,A Cat in Paris,7,12 August 2012,A little gem?...,"I really like the hand-drawn animation with great attention to detail. I also very much enjoyed the musical score by Serge Besset. All the performances were good (if a little odd in places more on that later) so honourable mentions go to the voice talents of; Marcia Gay Harden as Jeanne, JB Blanc as Victor Costa, Anjelica Huston as Claudine and Matthew Modine as Lucas.I guess the filmmakers were trying to please everyone by making the accents of the characters quite international. Of course the bad guy has an English accent, with one of his henchmen being German. There's an old lady with a very American accent; to be honest, it's all a bit confusing! Even so, I did find it entertaining with nods to Hitchcock (amongst others), this one managed to do much more right than wrong. It's funny (in parts) too, there's one recurring gag with a barking dog that had me in stitches! Over all, it's one I don't mind giving my seal of approval to.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED.My Score 6.5/10IMDb Score: 6.8/10 (based on 2,310 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 63/100: (Based on 19 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 82/100 (based on 55 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 72/100 'Liked It' (based on 3,299 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
28,A Cat in Paris,,19 July 2012,policier ad usum delphini,"touching, nice, interesting. not very moral, in fact, but this is not great problem. its virtue - the colors and game with Paris symbols, Eiffel Tower or Notre Dame de Paris as perfect actors. in same measure, a pleasant music. and adorable moments. a policier ad usym delphini. but really good for science of measure, for the art to create a puzzle with ordinary pieces but not boring. a cat as axis of events. a mother, her daughter. and the group of evil gangster. a poor dog, roofs, trip in zoo, crumbs from Persepolis animation. revenge, love story, wise thief with brave heart and slices of seduction. nothing new. nothing complicated. but beautiful. and this is the point !"
29,A Cat in Paris,5,9 March 2015,It must have been a very slow Oscar year for animated features.,"I'll cut to the chase. ""A Cat of Paris"" was Oscar-nominated in one of the worst years in recent memories for the category of Best Animated Feature. Considering that the mediocre (at best) film ""Rango"" won and films like ""Puss 'n Boots"" and ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" were also nominated, I think I can rest my case. ""A Cat of Paris"" is really no better and is a film I could have skipped.The movie is told using a very simple looking animation style and looks a bit like another nominee that year, ""Chico and Rita"". The drawings appear a bit crude and the film has a very non-Hollywood look. Some might like it--I just thought it looked less than Oscar- worthy. Now it it NOT because I expect all animated films to look like Disney, Pixar or Dreamworks films--but I would have expected for with an Oscar nominee.The story is about a cat who spends its days living with a mute little girl. However, at night when she sleeps, it slips out and hangs with a thief with a heart of gold (a bad cliché, I admit). Later, when the child is caught up with a vicious group of gangsters, the thief and cat come to her rescue.I found myself only moderately interested in the film. It's not bad but it wasn't particularly inspired. I think had it NOT been nominated, I actually would have enjoyed it more, as my expectations were awfully high but the film couldn't match them. Additionally, I was a bit surprised how nasty and scary the gangsters were, as it seems a bit too much for younger viewers--which is unusual for a cartoon."
