0,Wild Tales,10,24 May 2017,The Darkest Most Funny Movie I Have Ever Seen,"I don't even know how to begin with describing this masterpiece. This movie is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen, I am more than serious. I don't think words can describe the love I have for this amazingly funny masterpiece, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that both made me laugh and cry so much.The way this movie portrays humans and their behavior, and how this world is is just incredible. The whole way this movie is put together is just brilliant and I have personally never seen anything like it. The darkness the humor and the love in this movie is just huge, and you keep wondering if you should be laughing or crying.There are 6 different stories, and they just keep getting better. They are all very different but very emotionally connected. I am not going to tell you what they are about, only because i think going in ignorant to what is about to happen make the movie so much better. All I can say is some of the stories are sweet, some of the stories are very dark, and some of the stories are both, and all the stories are amazing breath-taking hilarious, and the are all amazingly beautiful. The directing is beautifully done, and really shows the stories the best way possible. Not knowing any of the actors I was more than pleasantly surprised by how amazing many of them were. I just wanna finish by saying I hope you will watch this movie after reading this, and I really hope you are going to love it just as much as I did. 10/10"
1,Wild Tales,9,25 August 2014,Too much fun and human darkness for one day.,"Watched last night at the theater with my girlfriend.It's a compilations of 6 tales, but they don't have the same type of lenght, humor or darkness. Each one is unique.1) Airplane tale: fantastic, hilarating and surrealistic story to open the series.2) Coffee shop tale: shorter, but dark and makes you wonder what's ""freedom"" for some people.3) Road tale: excellent. A really LOT of violence and a little bit of humor makes this one of the best tales in the movie.4) Human limit tale: a man that's having a couple of really bad days explode when he runs out of patiente. Great acting.5) Accident tale: 90% darkness. And the fact that could be a very possible story makes it even darker. Shocking finale.6) Wedding tale: almost impossible to qualify. Hilarious for the most part, but at the end, it will make you wonder to whom you are spending your whole life with.Seeing this compilation in a theater for the price of one, its a damn good deal if you ask me.Go watch it."
2,Wild Tales,8,25 August 2014,"Clever, dark and funny","The movie is actually 6 short films, all related by brutal violence motivated by different situations. Family. Society. Government. It works very well like that, lasting over 120 minutes that go by quickly. It feels very fluid. Szifrón's eye is very precise. You can tell everything was very well thought. I wouldn't say this is a philosophical film, but it is clever entertainment, that makes you think if this wild tales are actually that wild... Even though this stories are taken to the extreme, everything feels somehow possible when you look back. Darkly humorous. Watch it."
3,Wild Tales,10,30 January 2015,What a wonderful idea!,"I went to see this movie hoping to get a brake from Hollywood production. And I did. It was amazing, one of the best movies I've seen on big screen in 2 or 3 years.Plot consists of different stories which all have one thing in common: they are about revenge. Every single story starts rather boring. At the very beginning I was thinking ""What's so wild about it? It is just lame"" and by the end of the intro I was like ""Holy God! No, they did not just twist it like that! OMG!""And it gets better. A true masterpiece. I am from Russia so for me it was rather interesting and surprising that Latin America is so similar to Russia. The views, the behaviour of the people, the insanity - all like at home.You won't regret seeing this movie. Don't take your kid or your grandmother though."
4,Wild Tales,8,17 March 2015,Wildly thrilling. Wildly fun. Wildly original.,"This Argentine film that found itself nominated for the 2014 Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award comes to us from director Damián Szifrón who has crafted a feature film comprised of a series of 6 vignettes/small stories about human beings from all walks of (Argentine) life who are all tested and taken to their limits ... until they finally lose control. While mostly disastrous the film is also WILDly thrilling and wholly original in its daring cheekiness ... as the film is a bitter dark comedy (with tinges of brutal drama).It is a film about a myriad group of people on a plane; a young waitress who still finds herself grieving over a family tragedy of the past; an encounter between two men from different social classes on a desolate highway; a man growing tired of the rat race of life in which we are all destined to lose; the aftermath of a horrible automobile accident; and a wedding reception like none you've ever seen before. All feature one or two characters taken to the edge ...It is how each of them handles their various situations that give us our WILD stories. Fascinatingly grim at times, the film almost always miraculously produces laughter and grins. Much of the laughter might be heavily muffled as one chuckles under his/her breath as others around them fail to see the director's (WILDly) wicked sense of humor come into play in some of the film's intense situations; but the dark tone pervades the entire film.While the film is most definitely tragic in many instances, Wild Tales is a comedy of errors about human nature and who we are. Some can watch this and most-likely not pick up even a hint of humor; but it is there ... and it is fantastically facetious.Wildly thrilling. Wildly fun. Wildly original. It is courageously wild."
5,Wild Tales,10,27 August 2014,Just Brilliant !,"6 Stories - 6 masterpieces! They perfectly combine thriller, drama, humor and the common topic is the violence.Each tale is independent from the other, but all of them have something special that makes you really enjoy.The situations introduced in each story are actually based on real life, of course the are intentionally exaggerated with a sense of satire and irony that really makes you laugh.The picture is the best I have seen in an Argentina movie and the music ""made ​​in"" Santaolalla is sublime.The actors/actresses are amazing (specially the bride - Erica Rivas) In my opinion it is one of the best non-English Language movies ever."
6,Wild Tales,10,12 October 2014,Time does not heal all wounds.,"Time does not heal all wounds. One thing leads to another in six outrageous, hilarious and extreme stories of revenge. A jilted and emotionally volatile bride wreaks havoc at her wedding with an equally unstable new husband, a towing company hauls away one too many times the vehicle belonging an explosive expert, and two macho drivers  one in an Audi and the other in a pile of junk  go head to head with explosive road rage, among other delicious and fiery adventures. The utmost fantasies fulfilled, the extremes of emotions, and the riot of laughter that engulfed me from all sides, I cannot remember having such a good time watching a film. The director, who answered questions at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, said the film is about the pleasure of losing control and giving in to unrestrained passions. Is it ever!"
7,Wild Tales,9,25 August 2014,6 hilarious black comedy live action shorts,"This Argentinian movie was released in my country (Chile) on last Thursday, and since i heard very good comments about the movie i decided to go to a Cinema at Parque Arauco in Chile and this is what i wrote about it:The film is split into six unconnected stories, watching each story is around 20-30 minutes long and you feel like you're watching a live action short film. What do they have in common? All of them are a mix between drama and comedy. The script is hilarious, even if the lines are sad, it's so full of black comedy, that there were people rolling on the floor laughing at the Cinema. I'd write much more about this film, but i think i might be spoiling it, so i prefer to tell you that i can't wait to watch it again. So please do NOT miss it."
8,Wild Tales,10,29 September 2014,"Very dark, very funny, extremely realistic","Wild Tales (Relatos Salvajes) is perhaps the darkest and funniest movie I saw in years; but is it really a comedy ?. No it is not. Six tales about human that are obviously related to the Argentinian reality (abusive government, corruption, people indifference) but certainly can be applied to many other countries in the world; USA included.Telling about each tale will cut the impact and somewhat surprise of each one. Let's just say that the outcome of each tale is sometimes predictable; but driven by logic not clichés.As always happens; some histories are better than others; but even that will be different for different viewers.In brief; an excellent movie that deserves to be seen by people with a brain and a will to think."
9,Wild Tales,10,23 August 2014,"""All may lose control""","It's hard to review an unconventional movie, because this one is sort of six movies all in one. Relatos Salvajes (Wild Tales) is about six different and independent stories with one thing in common: the limit of our patience, or like it's tagline says...""All may lose control"". Ordinary people that find themselves in awkward situations they didn't look for, and that's the beauty of this movie. It's almost impossible not to feel identified with one of the characters, with one of their situations, despite the awkward moments they struggle that in some passages make us feel uncomfortable. And the merit of director Damián Szifrón is to tell those stories with an exquisite combination of intrigue, suspense and a remarkable and effective dark humor. The acting, editing, photography and the music of Gustavo Santaolalla are all ingredients that give extra points. You'll get out of the cinema talking to each other which tale you enjoyed the most and reviewing some of their hilarious scenes."
10,Wild Tales,10,18 March 2015,Hopefully Damián Szifron is on his way to Hollywood,"Hopefully Damián Szifron is on his way to Hollywood. Simply the most refreshing and entertaining film that I've been lucky enough to watch since Nightcrawler...really it's that good. The darkest comedy you'll have the pleasure to experience. Ticks all the boxes, cinematic, a superb ensemble cast deliver in every short story, dead pan humour, intelligent, thought provoking, terrifyingly realistic, wonderful camera-work especially in the final story, with a couple of explosions and some (thankfully) subtle CGI thrown in to complete this masterpiece. Lovely to once again sit amid an audience all happily laughing out loud, without the need to lower itself to racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic humour, though the scatological humour is surprisingly perfectly appropriate and carefully framed to make the point without unnecessary vulgarity. Ten out of Ten. A new name to watch. Kudos to Damián Szifron."
11,Wild Tales,10,26 February 2015,What a Ride,"I had an idea from the opening credits that Damian Szifron's WILD TALES, was going to be fun. Images of animals with the actors' names as counterpart, preparing the audience for the animalistic behavior about to come.The film is comprised of six separate vignettes, short stories, if you will. These vignettes all begin innocently enough, passengers boarding a plane, a man driving through the desert, a restaurant on a stormy night, a wedding, everyday slices of modern day life. Something occurs to break the routine, the main character responds, then the scene escalates, and escalates, and when you think you've reached the peak, it escalates even more, and finally in the end reaches a perfect balance of comedy and tragedy. The tales are all perfectly relatable and escalate logically and realistically, nothing comes out from left field. All the characters, each flawed in so many ways, remind us so much of ourselves, both at our best and at our worst... and make us laugh and feel in recognition.Great Movie."
12,Wild Tales,10,19 November 2015,This is Cinema !,"i always thought that the real art is missing these days, the cinema is going on the wrong side, this movie was the hope, that there is still genius artist who can makes such a beautiful story, with excellence in direction and perfection in casting, this is the best movie i ever watched so far, it is black comedy and it is REAL, it is like what you think you DO, what you imagine COMES REAL, it is HUMAN, for those who really loves the art of cinema, MUST MUST MUST watch this movie, you will enjoy it from the beginning to the cast list, it is a THEATER in a cinema movie, 10/10 and we will wait a lot to see such a quality movie like this one."
13,Wild Tales,8,21 May 2015,Big things have small beginnings,"Never watched any Argentine/Spanish film before. Actually, the number of foreign language (ie. other than English and Hindi) films I have watched till date is not even two digit. Still, this movie was mind-blowing!! Wild Tales, is a package of 6 short films which are dark and explosive comedies. All of them has the theme of revenge strikingly common and each one of them is unique and funny in its own way. Each one of them puts forth wild yet realistic situations. The first short story is the shortest of them and is shown pre-credits.Its story of a psych who is not even seen on the screen who makes revenge plan which ends on a bang giving us an overly wild ending. The second film slightly more dark and longer, will make you think before deciding what is right and what is wrong. Third one even longer, is my favorite alongside the fourth. Its violent and brutally hilarious with explosive ending(literally). The fourth one sheds light on realistic situation of a common man troubled by the abusive government system. Another explosion in the climax(again literally)! The fifth slightly less on humor quotient but portrays the human characteristic of greed perfectly. Its darker and has a shocking finale! Th last one, longest and wildest of them all will take you to one of the craziest weddings you have ever seen. Beneath its madness it subtly touches upon the issues of trust and betrayals in human relations.Besides the common notion of revenge and letting oneself lose control in rage, all these tales also focus on how tiniest of our actions can lead to monstrous consequences. The comedy is satirical and dark still its outright hilarious in many scenes. There are many actors (each story has different cast), can't highlight anyone as most of them have done a good job. Director Damian Szifron executes all the ridiculous madness and explosive twists with sheer brilliance leaving dazed at the end of each story. The soundtrack is also quirky and beautiful.The two hours fly away like a breeze. Even if you don't understand the language you will be so invested that after sometime you won't even realize that you are watching a Non- English film. Highly enjoyable!RATING: [4/5]"
14,Wild Tales,7,10 June 2015,Very good Argentina/Spain co-production being stunningly  directed and efficiently produced by Pedro Almodovar .,"This picture displaying genuine humor , thrills , chills , suspense , dark atmosphere and twisted conclusions , being skillfully proceeded . At the beginning, in the title credits each main actor of each tale is identified with a wild animal , and in the director's case, it is a fox . Subsequently , it takes place six short stories involving distressed people . They are titled : Pasternak , The strongest , Little bomb , Proposal , The rats and Until Death Do Us Apart.This exciting , bizarre film contains black humor , tension , thriller , drama , plot twists and shocks . Disconcerting black comedy packs crazy events , amusement and absurd situations . Sitting in a strange middle ground between the completely absurd and the stylish set pieces , adding some enjoyable moments . It is an Argentina/Spain co-production by El Deseo : Agustin and Pedro Almodóvar , that turns out to be an acceptable film because of the thriller , tension , Kafkaesque suspense , embarrassing humor as well as an interestingly written script concerning complex episodes episodes in which our protagonists are in such extreme situation and their subsequent instinctive urges for exploding violent feelings . We immediately see that the stories are going to be told from some unorthodox perspectives as each scene and its conclusion result to be surprising and shocking . Despite its disturbing as well as violent developing the picture manages to be intelligent , intriguing and thrilling , being entertaining to follow . The good thing about this film is that the director made it on an enough budget , including several sets , yet the movie works on many levels but is constantly reconfigured . The final outcome is an offbeat picture that's captivating , in spite of not being all that fun , resulting to be thoughtful and thought-provoking , dealing with the impact of violence nowadays . The interesting as well as original screenplay is 84 pages long and some of the six tales are featured in different order , it also includes a seventh tale , pretty much shorter than the other ones, called Bonus Track . Being official submission of Argentina to the best foreign language film category of the 87th Academy Awards 2015 . Top-notch cast formed by prestigious Argentinean actors as Darío Grandinetti , María Marull and Leonardo Sbaraglia .

Furthermore , colorful and evocative cinematography by Javier Julia . Rousing musical score by Gustavo Santaolalla , including an attractive leitmotif . Gustavo is considered to be one of the best international composers , his works in group production from the USA have turned Santaolalla into a prominent figure in that area, what gave him, besides, the chance to participate in big musical projects for cinema movies with successful results such as ""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"",""The Motorcycle Diaries"", crowned with the Oscar award by the music of the controversial film ""Brokeback Mountain"" and in 2007 for his friend Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Babel"" . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Damián Szifrón who shot in 8 weeks and he wrote most of the tales from the movie in his bathtub , he actually said: "" The bath is a great place to write"". Damián was born in Buenos Aires, , location in which he often shoots his films . He is a writer and director , known for El Fondo del Mar or Bottom sea (2003) , Tiempo De Valientes (2005) and this Relatos Salvajes (2014) at his best ; being elected by Time as one of the best films of 2014."
15,Wild Tales,9,12 March 2015,Absolutely gripping short stories,"Being a horror and thriller fan, this movie was very interesting.Stories of revenge one after the other will keep you on the edge of your seat! And the stories told are short. Filled with suspense. You will not know what is going to happen next. And the stories will seem so real. Stories of day to day anger and real life occurrences. The actors are very convincing in their roles. Pace of the short stories is very gripping.Some of the shots captured are amazing. Overall very thrilling! And a must watch!"
16,Wild Tales,8,25 August 2014,Modern rage + black comedy,"Mixing modern rage with black comedy this collection of shorts rises above expectations to become one of the best and funniest movies from Argentina along with The Secret In Their Eyes and El Aura, and probably the most accessible for international audiencesSix unrelated stories that share a common theme of revenge are shown back to back, and not edited back and forward like it's usual with these kind of movie, some of them are better than others: the opener, the road rage incident, the hit and run, and the wedding stand out, while the more conventional and predictable ""Bombita"" and ""The Rats"" still entertain thanks to superb writing and directingThere's a few annoying problems with logical plot holes like why would the rich yuppie go out of his way to put the damaged spare tired in his trunk (and thus leaving it open) when running for his life and factual errors like on the wedding episode the bride's threats about this husband's companies are meaningless because in Argentina possessions are considered marriage goods (""bienes gananciales"") only if the are acquire during the marriage and not before like the screen husband's companies, and like these are others but among such high quality stuff glaring mistakes like these are more evidenthighly recommended"
17,Wild Tales,8,12 March 2015,"Rage and Revenge, Guilty Laughter","Greetings again from the darkness. Do you often get accused of having a slightly demented sense of humor? Do you have secret crazy thoughts of seeking revenge on those who have wronged you? If so, writer/director Damian Szifron has a collection of short stories just for you!Nominated for Best Foreign Language Oscar, Argentina's entry is just now opening in the Dallas market where I live. To say Wild Tales is a wild ride would be quite an understatement. There are six short stories blended together, and while you may not recognize the theme immediately, it doesn't take long before rage and retribution jump to the forefront in these seemingly typical slices of everyday life.The best short stories make a quick grab for attention, and manage to convey character and setting from the beginning. The writing is crucial and can easily collapse in the hands of a less-proficient short story writer. But when it works, it's fascinating to watch, and Mr. Szifron has a real talent for making us laugh in the midst of truly awful situations.Not to give away any details, but the six stories involve: a remarkable ""coincidence"" on a flight, an unwelcome customer at a local diner, a close-quarters brawl at a bridge, the frustration of dealing with ""the system"", misguided parental instincts in protecting their kid, and the most wheels-off wedding reception ever filmed.If you are ever searching for an example of a dark comedy, this one will provide clarity. The seemingly unrelated stories are woven together through payback, though the price is often pretty high. Mr. Szifron's stories remind us that life is not fair, but when it's happening to someone else, we can still laugh about it."
18,Wild Tales,10,3 January 2015,Six stories of frustration leading to joyous revenge,"The Spanish title is more apt: Savage Tales. Six short stories show various ways in which savagery persists in the highest levels of civilization. The titles appear against a montage of wild animals. The twist is that here the savagery is celebrated not rued. Where civilization was supposed to free us from savagery, as in the American Western, here the savagery liberates the characters from their civilization. As director Damian Szifron told the Palm Springs festival audience, ""The theme is the pleasure of losing control. Releasing the beast.""In each story a modern frustration wells up until the character erupts. All the stories involve a furious revenge, with a broadening range of characters. To convey the tensions in modern life, ordinary sounds are amplified, like the luggage wheels in the opening shot. In the pre-credit tale, the pilot turns out to be a lifelong failure who has collected the various teachers, friends, psychiatrist, who have thwarted him, on a flight he will crash into his parents. In a diner the waitress recognizes a customer as the smalltown gangster who drove her father into bankruptcy and suicide. Now running for mayor, he is rude and abusive. As her anger and conscience struggle the cook takes over and kills him. She's content to return to the security and comfort of jail.An Audi driver rages at a redneck who blocks his way. When the rich guy stops to fix a flat tire his nemesis stops and assaults him. The road rage turns into class warfare. Ironically, when they're found burned alive their clutch suggests it was a crime passionel.When an explosives expert gets his car towed for an unjustified parking ticket his angry campaign for justice blows up his marriage, job, career and even shared custody of his daughter. When he blows up the tower's yard he becomes a local hero, Mr Dynamite. In jail his wife and daughter bring him a birthday cake and all the inmates and guards celebrate his day. His last act is blowing out the candles. Terrorism works.A spoiled teenager's fatal hit and run accident leads to a steadily expanding chain of corruption as his wealthy father tries to get the family groundskeeper to take the rap for him. As the bribery balloons no-one is innocent. Even the humble groundskeeper raises his demands. When the father decides not to pay to save his spoiled son, his lawyer says it would be dishonourable for him to renege on his bribery of the the public prosecutor. When the boy decides to confess the greedy renegotiate their scheme. As the fall guy is led away an angry citizen kills him. Amid all the bribes and false honour the poor worker pays the price.In the climax, a rich Jewish family's wedding, the bride explodes after the groom admits he had sex with a colleague who's a guest. The demure bride turns into a vengeful virago wreaking massive destruction, reducing the groom to tears, the ceremony to chaos, and her rival to a bloodied mess. When the newlyweds reconnect  making passionate love amid the ruins of the cake  their union feels more honest than the initial smiles and formality. Now their union expresses more passion than manners. The chaotic wedding is more honest than the ceremonial ritual was. The anthology structure hearkens back to Italian neorealism, where separate short stories provided a wide-ranging survey of social issues. Apt for a celebration of the unruly, the film is exuberantly comic but with a black undercurrent. As its initial frustrations are so common, the film provides its audience with a greater catharsis than most comedies or tragedies. We're left calm of mind, frustrations spent."
19,Wild Tales,9,6 April 2015,The absolute definition of black comedy,"Maybe I was just in the right mood after a frustrating, wasted day, but this wonderfully irreverent portmanteau movie hit the spot for me. In many ways it took me back to the days of Bunuel. The format means every story has to set its scene fast and be told with economy and unusually there is no weak link here. Most of the tales keep you guessing right to the end in a Twilight Zone kind of way, whilst you are being fed the best in cinematography and acting. There are several standout bravura performances, most notably from Ricardo Darin (also brilliant in ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" a few years ago) as a mild-mannered engineer driven to extreme measures and Erica Rivas, in the climactic section, as a bride who reacts badly to a setback at her wedding reception. If you are easily shocked, keep clear; otherwise, be prepared for a terrific ride. I already envy those who don't know what is coming next!"
20,Wild Tales,9,27 January 2017,"Wow, Anger is really a powerful emotion!","Great movie telling stories I would label centering around anger. I realized how powerful anger emotion is and how quickly it can ruin your life for good.1) Airplane: It was developed beautifully and gratz to the pilot for determination.2) Restaurant: The douche bag of a guy basically kills the girls father, girl thinks about confronting him and the chef lady thinks confronting him is not enough at all. 3) Car: Need to be careful about road rage, you don't know who is the guy in the other car. I think this goes for any rage. I think I can conclude that we shouldn't rage.4) Tow away: Really good criticism of government and it's fines. There should be a better method to determine which fine is just. Also I agree that most government workers are really annoying, they don't enjoy their job at all and the mind set ""I am just trying to do my job"" is absolutely true.5) Hit and run: Really good visualization of what money can make people do. Basically if you have enough money, you carry a get out jail card with you. The twist in the end was really awesome, poor gardener.6) Wedding: This was my favorite story by far. It shows that how things can escalate quickly out of hand. Also it is easy to make bad decisions while under so much pressure like a wedding ceremony. I must say bride was really good and very nice acting. But I doubt that make up sex will solve their problem...Awesome movie, really effected me while being entertaining."
21,Wild Tales,7,5 February 2016,Six short stories that make a good movie,"When i read it was going to be a movie with six short stories I was worried because almost all the other movies with short stories I saw before are just too boring. You never feel satisfied with short stories like that but in Relatos Salvajes you don't get that feeling. Every single story is fun to watch. They are all with a bit of violence , but that what's make it great. Watching people loosing it. I thought all the actors that participated in this movie did a great job. I didn't expect to be this entertained but at the end I was certainly pleased that I watched those short stories. Two hours of entertainment that flew by in a second."
22,Wild Tales,9,26 June 2015,early shoe-in for top-25 of 2015.,"Note:My top-25 list are based on the U.S. release date.. so while it has 2014 next to it on IMDb, this will be featured on my pending 2015 list.""Wild Tales"" was an orgasmic reprieve from the diluted, poorly written, oft-regurgitated Hollywood romcom's that saturated my rental selections the last few days.It's a collection of short stories that mainly focuses on the animalistic nature of human beings. It's often funny, sometimes shocking, and the quality of the work overall is exceptional.It looks great and sounds great, and is one of the more entertaining films that I've seen in a while. The acting is strong top to bottom, and no one segment pulls the rest of it down. They are all good, but personally I think the middle segments(""road rage"" and ""botched wedding"") are the best. ""Dynamite Joe"" probably the weakest, and that is primarily due to it's unrealistic climax.There's some spectacular moments of cinematography and music. Definitely reminiscent of films like ""Babel"", but the subject/themes are based more upon black-comedy-bad-fortune type scenario's. Think ""After Hours"" or ""Creepshow 2"" ONLY with the cinematography and overall attention to detail similar to ""Babel"". I highly recommend this. Very pleasant surprise that went directly onto my ""Jeremy's B-Movie Marathon List Part 4"".85/100 SOLID!Glad to see this was nominated for an Academy Award. Deservedly so."
23,Wild Tales,8,24 January 2015,"Hilarious, satirical and over the top","If ordinary films are like novels, this one is like an exquisite collection of short stories. The film is divided into six segments, each with its own plot and character development. Director Damian Szifron is like a modern-day Guy de Maupassant, telling each story with meticulous accuracy, carefully measuring out each twist, detail and conversation. The segments are hilarious and over the top, but at the same time satirical and somehow realistic - the extreme events could happen to any of us. That's why this is such a great film: its shows the darkest side of human nature and of Argentinian society, but in such a way that it makes you smile. The director claims the theme connecting the stories is 'the joy of losing control'. It's also the tag-line of the movie: 'We can all lose control'. Indeed, most of the segments are about losing control, although one is about keeping everything under control in a situation that can easily spin out of control. In any case, all segments are about individuals solving a conflict in an extreme way. In most segments, the solution is extremely violent or deadly. Although the trailer splashes out the name 'Almodovar' because Pedro and his brother produced the film, the style is by no means Almodovar-like. Szafron uses a sophisticated style, very different from the extreme cinematography we know from Almodovar. 'Relatos Salvajes' also surprises with original cinematographic gimmicks. In one scene, the camera is positioned in an overhead bin of an airplane. In another, in the interior of an ATM, with the image filmed through the touch screen. The film is carefully constructed, with lots of little details. In one segment, about a man fighting the parking ticket bureaucracy in his city, we see the conspicuous towing trucks constantly moving through the image, as a sort of evil force. Once again, an Argentinian film maker pleasantly surprises moviegoers around the world. Maybe such wonderful, sharp-edged movies can only flourish in a country like Argentina, where life is a bit of a struggle and not everything is taken for granted"
24,Wild Tales,10,18 January 2015,Highly Recommended:  Wild Tales,"Wild Tales is the best film I have seen in a long time. The script is so clever and unique that is a must see for movies lovers. What is the border between tolerance and barbarism? We can all loose control in just one second even in the most ordinary situations. Action lovers will enjoy the ride more than romantic audiences since revenge is at the center of this master piece. In my opinion, this is the best Argentine Film in decades and a box office record in Latin America and Spain. Even Almodovar brothers are the producers the film has a unique style that is not crazy but real. Get ready for a different kind of movie that will take you out of your seat and even we shouldn't laugh about it ...well I can guarantee that you will. Clever mixed of comedy and drama that will make you think again and again and even change behaviors after you give it a thought. If Wild Tales doesn't get the Oscar for Best Foreign Film I might wonder who will."
25,Wild Tales,10,21 March 2016,Six extreme and surreal set-ups create darkly comedic results,"I really enjoyed the film; I felt the six short stories worked well together in tone - black humour at its finest. Each shows a surreal and unlikely scenario, and the viewer is gripped to discover the outcome. I thought the shots were composed amazingly - the cinematography is innovative and thoughtful (low level panning, cameras attached to doors, etc). The colour grading ties the stories together well and sets a sickly tone.1) Aeroplane tale: I enjoyed discovering what was happening as the scene unfolded. The ending was great. One unknown man's extreme reaction to his wrongdoers.2) Coffee shop tale: Makes you wonder what you would do in such a situation. Dark and bloody, but I found this tale the least satisfying - however there was an interesting message to ponder in the ending.3) Road tale: Very violent, and a little ironic. Although both jerks, I found myself rooting for one (younger, richer) jerk over the other - I wonder if other viewers felt the same way? Makes a joke out of male road rage.4) Car towing tale: One man's fight with the tedious, overbearing bureaucracy of a car towing company. Brilliant, really enjoyable. Sometimes, you have to take a stand.5) Car accident tale: Many twists in the tale. You never know what to expect with each incremental development to the plot. Impossible to care about any of these unlikeables, but a fascinating character study with a twisty plotting plot that doesn't disappoint.6) Wedding tale: I loved this one the most. The most explosive wedding ever. If you were a guest, you'd be thinking, I should really leave... but I think I'm gonna get some popcorn and see what happens next. Love, sex, revenge, romance, forgiveness, betrayal, violence - what more could you want from a story?! I'd definitely recommend it. I cannot wait to see what the Argentinian writer/director Damián Szifrón will do next. The tone of the film reminded me of a quirkier Delicatessen, or a darker Amélie. My only complaint would be that the short nature of the tales made it hard to identify with the characters, who in many cases didn't really act like normal people (I'm not sure why, but I especially wanted a different outcome for the bride), but I get that that was kind of the point, and enjoyed it anyway. Brilliant!"
26,Wild Tales,10,29 December 2015,Incredible!,"The movie consists of six different stories and when you hear that you may think it is not a good movie. Well, what is special in this movie that every story can create a movie itself and the link between them is that they give you the same feeling in which once the suspense in one story ends, it begins with the next one. Vague endings give you the daily dose of suspense. It is special, it is one of a kind and crazy that you don't know in what category you can put the movie in. The director has succeeded in his work and made such a great start to begin the movie world with such an amazing job. he has a bright future ahead of him. keep it up and we're waiting for the next movie."
27,Wild Tales,10,20 November 2015,"Wild, bold, funny and smart","I never thought that those anthology movies work entirely; one or two shorts always stand out while the rest sucks. This isn't the case with Wild Tales; a movie that's been on my watchlist for quite sometime and I'm glad I gave it a chance. With the opening scene, you get a taste of what your in for and you're immediately hooked. What comes after that, is a series of well-acted, dark and hilarious short movies; not very common traits of the dark-comedy genre, explaining why this movie ranks so high on the IMDb list. I can't recommend this movie enough, you may not enjoy it as much as I did, but surely you will find at least one of the shorts entertaining. Personally, I can't pick a favorite. Although I did find the 5th one to be the weakest. All in all, the director gets a thumbs up from me, didn't watch any of his other features but he is on my radar from now on."
28,Wild Tales,8,14 September 2015,Creepily effective black comedy,"If you've been feeling a mite cocky about where your life is headed of late, you might want to take a gander at ""Wild Tales"" for a much needed reality check. This omnibus Spanish feature, sharply written and directed by Damian Szifron, offers a series of very dark, very disturbing and sometimes very humorous vignettes, all centered on chance (and not so chance) encounters that go awry in unexpected and often tragic ways. The movie makes it clear that, while you may think you have control over your life, in the grand scheme of things, you're really just a pawn subject to the whims of other individuals, a soulless bureaucracy or, most chillingly, a cruel and mocking Fate. However, in two of the cases, the participants do manage to wrest control back from the outside forces and determine the course of their lives - to some extent, at least.As is often the case with these kinds of morality tales, most of the scenarios rely heavily on situational irony to get their points across. I won't detail the various stories (you really need to experience them for yourself), but I will note that the first one, involving an airliner, comes uncomfortably close to an actual event that occurred after the movie was released. Segments one and three contain the most visceral impact, while others cut deeper psychologically. Even the tones vary from one storyline to another. For instance, the final story, about a wedding that turns into a surrealistic nightmare, is shot through with pitch-dark humor. Replete with sharp performances from a talented cast, the movie touches on such universal human themes as revenge, road rage, class privilege, all tied to the sense of powerlessness one feels when confronted with forces bigger than oneself. In its own subtle, quiet way, the movie has a remarkable ability to keep the audience on the edge of its seat, filled with a kind of gnawing dread as we await the catastrophe we sense is just over the horizon. As with all the best horror tales, Szifron understands that the anticipation is often more terrifying than the actual event when it finally arrives. The movie as a whole has a way of unnerving us while it drives home some unpleasant and uncomfortable truths about what it means to be human."
29,Wild Tales,9,11 August 2015,"Radical, humorous and dramatic!","Splendid and well crafted.A slightly radical film, this is a collection of six equally good short stories of different people from director Damian Scifron and producer Pedro Almodovar. Engaging throughout and entire film; well shot and performed with convivial dialogue. Thoroughly dramatic as well as humorous this film will keep you excited throughout, no doubt. An interesting blend of characters as well. To be able to create six funny, intense and ironic stories and combine them in one is really the work of a master director. A well chosen cast tops off this terrific comedy drama. Evidently one of the better films of 2015 so far A must see! Solid and comfortable 9."
30,Wild Tales,9,25 July 2015,Surprisingly delightful,"More story por favor :) So there are 6 epic stories in this movie.Remember the Vengeance trilogy, the story is kinda like that but it is shorter and it has lot dark comedy in it.I love that the first three stories have short build up without delaying the excitement. I think it's just hilarious.I kinda hate the fourth story I think it is the weakest link, I would rate it six.The fifth story is kinda weak too.The last story is bit different than the rest, but is the most hilarious. It is about marriage and love but with dark comedy in it, something refreshing so just watch it.Overall it's quite refreshing, this is one of non-English movie that you don't wanna miss."
31,Wild Tales,10,3 May 2015,Wildly Entertaining,"WOW!.Whew! Did I see a movie?. Or witness different real life incidents with exclusive inside preview of why these happened?.Yes and it was exquisitely done. Six Tales - referred in the Argentinean language as ""Savage Tales"" may not refer to the tale itself as savage. The plot itself is very simple - revenge (savage revenge!) - the sudden impulse to give or take back in equal or multiplied proportion what was done to them. Anybody can do that - not necessarily a poor man in the street but can be a ultra modern civilized being in a perfectly civilized and urban setting!!!. There you go. But to what extent people go to extract revenge in a sudden impulsive movement?. And that is intriguing and deeply introspective. David Edelstein a film critic mentioned about this movie - ""I'm guessing that the oldest subject in literature isn't love or war or the struggle for survival, but revenge."". This movie is about that and a thoroughly entertaining one at that. From the very first tale of the flight travel scene where everyone is shocked and surprised after gradually learning something till the last tale where the bride and bridegroom undergo the ""till death do us apart"" ceremony - it's a wild journey - edge of the seat engagement. My favorite Ricardo Darín as Simon the demolitions expert is a treat to watch."
32,Wild Tales,8,23 April 2015,Acting out our violence and soothing us amid our absurd reality,"I usually develop headaches when I see excessive violence in movies. But Wild Tales makes me feel so good because I can identify with all the underdog characters who take their revenge to the extreme with very black humor. It just makes me feel exceptionally good and relieved. It is vicarious violence without having to pay any consequences! And those jerks really deserve what they finally get. Great acting and script writing. The 120 minute film composes of six tales, all related to realistic and corrupted and abusive government or bullies in our society. To maintain the suspense, fun and unpredictability, I cannot not divulge too much details of the tales other than saying it can happen anywhere in any country. All the protagonists in the six tales are decent people but they are pressed/abused by the ruthless and ridiculous reality to a point that revenge to the extreme is the natural and only way out. It is almost like a Ben and Jerry cartoon played by real people who resort to their actions with very strong reasons. Thus I can guarantee that you would feel good. The sad part is that reality sometimes really happened as depicted in the movie  such as the Germanwings incident and indifferent bureaucrats. But still, if you feel your life is suffocated in anyway, go see this and get wild for two hours. It will clear your frustration, makes you laugh hard, and help you look at things from a new perspective."
33,Wild Tales,9,2 April 2015,Shockingly violent and darkly hilarious,"This has to be one of the most shocking and blackest comedies of all time. It's basically not a comedy, although there are a lot of laughs, thanks to the insanely surreal situations that unfold here, as well as the ridiculously exaggerated violence that will make you laugh, but also shock you to the core. However, it's the thrilling stories throughout this film that will leave you breathless at every second, because it's just so unpredictable and so tense every step of the way.Firstly, an overview of the film as a whole. The fantastic directing by Damián Szifrón is one of the most impressive parts of the whole saga, and it really shows off on screen, and adds a whole lot more to the excitement of the stories, whilst the stunning writing in every separate story transforms this into an unbelievably thrilling playbook that bucks the trend of so many anthologies that create a disjointed story that can be boring to watch, there are swift transitions throughout here, and every single story is always just as exciting and unpredictable as the last.So, now let's go in order of the six stories, starting with the very short, but what I think is the best, opening aeroplane tale. This is very understated and, despite its short duration, has an ingeniously gradual build up, followed by a shocking revelation and then a hilarious punchline, by far the most exhilarating part of the film.However, the second tale, set in a roadside diner, is not far off that. Here, we really see the plain horrors of people driven by revenge, and it's definitely one of the most emotional stories of the film, but it utilises its small cast and eerie setting to great effect to create something completely unpredictable and engrossing.The third tale, a road battle that is often almost identical to Stephen Spielberg's Duel, is definitely the most violent part of the film, as well as the scariest by far, because it's just got a terrifying sense of isolation and helplessness, as well as a horrifying villain, but also a protagonist who you're never quite on side with, making the tension and violence a bit more hilarious than just petrifying.That's followed by what is the longest section of the film, simply about a man who has had enough with everyone treating him like some sort of a criminal. Although this isn't the most exhilarating tale, it's the easiest to relate to, and brings across the element of stress in its main character in brilliantly clear form.The penultimate tale, although I thought it was the weakest, was still intriguing. It details the events about the lengths people will go to to protect those closest to them and then further their own agenda, and whilst the punchline was ultimately a little predictable, it was still a horrifying account of the selfishness of many people.The final tale, about a wedding gone wrong, was the greatest emotional roller-coaster of the film. It's full of insane laughs, as well as an astonishing central performance by Erica Rivas, but it finishes the film on a real high note, impressing on you an image of complete madness and shocking violence that brilliantly sums up this entire film.www.themadmovieman.com"
34,Wild Tales,10,21 March 2015,"That other bird flopped, but this one truly soars","Who would have thought Argentina would deliver the best dark comedy of the last decade? Here is a movie that explores confusion, revenge, cheating, road rage, and a few other dark situations in the modern world, in a place that we call civilized.The film is composed of various stories, all dealing in one way or another with getting even. We know we are in for a special treat when the passengers of the plane realize they're all in for the ride of a lifetime, as they discover the common link that brings them together for this special flight.First, we encounter a waitress that is given the opportunity to avenge the sad events in her family. However, things don't always work out as one expects, and there's a little thing called conscience that keeps interfering with carrying out what could be the perfect crime. Yet when we think things can't be properly solved, a ""fairy godmother"" intervenes.In the second story, a man finds himself the victim of his own short temper, but we realize that his last actions are the result of probably years of bureaucratic abuse. He has complied before, but the events in one day are just too much to take, or maybe it would have been a matter of taking a deep breath and thinking it through. Unfortunately, he chooses to act, and things get more and more complicated. Once again, in a clever twist, one can say that our hero gets what he wants.We have one of the most hilarious depictions of road rage on the screen. As an upper middle class man confronts one ""deliverance"" type, and he discovers what hell on wheels really means. Abuse after abuse is portrayed on the screen, and each of the parties tries to outsmart the others, only to have the most ironic twist at the end. Prepare to laugh.We get to see the most fantastic wedding since ""The Wedding Banquet"", but the Ang Lee film was a masterwork of comic timing. This one is funny but it's because of the tragedy that forms the basis of the events. We just can't believe what we're seeing, as the battle of the sexes heats up and the twists keep coming. In the end, we wonder if it any of it was truly necessary.""Tales"" is a masterwork, with the presentation of the various situations, the humor in the lines, the way it was photographed and edited. Much praise is giving to particular topics. Why not explore the extremes we go to when anger becomes madness, and we forgot that we are civilized creatures, yet capable of the most animalistic actions we can imagine. Not sure if one can truly enjoy this, but one can certainly admire what has been done here."
35,Wild Tales,8,9 March 2015,"Six tales of ""Revenge""","With Pedro Almodóvar's name credited manifestly as one of the producers, viewers will not be too surprised that this portmanteau film from Argentinian director/writer Damián Szifrón is ripe with Almodóvaresque touch - six short, surreal, dark comedies, (most of them are) deeply rooted in the injustice presented in the current Argentinian society (however, it can be feasibly comprehended elsewhere since the situations are all the same), with a recurrent theme of vengeance flows through all of its components, as the pre-credit prologue named ""Pasternak"" glaringly sets the tone from an all-inclusive reprisal from an unknown man towards every single person who mistreats him in his life, it is absurdly implausible to effectuate such a scheme (too many variations are involved), but as the opening gambit and the shortest one, it effectively kick-starts the film with an offbeat grin beckons an unconventional wild-ride sinisterly awaits the audience, also it tells us revenge has no mercy at all.The opening credits furthermore impress with designs of different animals for the film's protagonists and the crew. Then the second story is ""The Rats"", confined in a small restaurant near the highway with minimal characters (two customers, one waitress and a cook) to play out a morally righteous murder starts with expired rat poisons to the appalling backstabbing, Rita Cortese as the experienced cook, is fearlessly ruthless to eradicate any excrescence of the society within her limited power, plainly because there is no other efficacious way to deter the evil ones ascending in the societal hierarchy. This time revenge is all for a good cause. Next chapter is called ""The Strongest"", a road rage clash between the posh car driver Diego (Sbaraglia) and a churlish imbecile Mario (Donado), one might recall Steven Spielberg's DUEL (1971, 7/10), but here there is no ominous car-chasing, due to a flat tyre, Diego has to pay for his stupidity to offend a low-class boor, and is driven by revenge when he has the chance to flee the scene, it is so naturalistic that the intention of killing has been induced even viewers in some level subconsciously concur with Diego's motivation, but the payoff is both ludicrous and horrendous, so revenge can be a crime of passion. The fourth one ""Little Bomb"" stars Ricardo Darin as a demolition expert, whose automobile has been towed by DMV when he is buying a birthday cake for his daughter, the next day he tries to reason with the clerks when he is coerced to pay the fine, but loses his temper and attack the partition with all the bureaucracy poppycock. Soon, the aftereffects cost his job and marriage, while his car still being towed again and again. Finally, he loads his car with explosives and the final towing blows up the towed-car lot. But Szifrón prepares a happy-ish ending for the tale, as the explosion is accurately calculated to avoid any casualties, and his bold behaviour is regarded as a potent testimony to decry DMV's money-extorting towing policy, he becomes an urban hero thanks to the social media, he gets the sobriquet ""Dynamite"", his wife and daughter visit him in prison for his birthday with all the inmates and prison guards hailing for him. Darin is so compelling as the good-gone- bad stereotype pushed to his limit by a despondent reality. The final revelation is a bit far- fetched and too much a wishful thinking, but it educates us, revenge needs meticulous calculation. The fifth story is ""The Proposal"", a rich kid cries for help from his parents after a hit-and-run accident leaving a pregnant woman died, the father (Martínez) buys off his gardener (de Silva) to bear the blame, but when a greedy lawyer (Núñez) and a police prosecutor (Velázquez) are involved, it evolves into a game of shameless blackmail, when those three all up their profits, the canny father abruptly turns the table and uses this case as a bargaining chip to regain the initiative (this smart move shows how Szifrón is a sharp observer and an acute thinker in his storytelling), but no one can predict an unexpected denouement. This is my favourite one, it purposefully blurs the line between the opposing sides of rich and poor, and when facing a windfall, human's avariciousness is impartially triggered albeit of their different backgrounds and social status, someone is more adroit at it, and for someone it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, alas, it is the most detrimental original sin in us and we should all constantly being reminded to overcome it. In this chapter, we learn that revenge can be achieved even one is at the apparent disadvantage. Last but not the least, the grand finale is ""Until Death Do Us Apart"", it is at the wedding banquet of Romina (Rivas) and Ariel (Gentile), they seem to be a perfect couple, until Romina's one unintentional glance prompts the most sensitive antenna - a woman's sixth sense, she finds out that Ariel has cheated on her with one of the wedding guest. Subsequently, she vents her ire and dismay by having sex with a random staff in the kitchen as a requital, which is witnessed by Ariel, afterwards, the wedding descends into a madcap buffoonery, yet no one can expect, all the mess actually hones up to a perfect foreplay for the pair, the story ends when the two engage into a passionate sexual intercourse in front of all the guests. Rivas is blazingly radiant in the wedding dress, with her tear-tainted make- up, she refuses to be a runaway bride, instead, she fights back to get even. And lastly, revenge can turn on one's libido, too!"
36,Wild Tales,7,17 May 2015,Six Black Comedies,"""Relatos Salvajes"" is a black comedy film divided in six segments. (1) ""Pasternak"": one model and a music critic in a plane find that they have a common acquaintance called Pasternak. Soon they discover that every passenger and crew on board know Pasternak. Cosmic coincidence? (2) ""The Rats"": a waitress of a diner recognizes her client as the loan shark that caused a tragedy in her family. The cook suggests mixing rat poison in his food, but she refuses. But the cook decides to proceed in her plan. When his son arrives, the waitress tries to fix the situation.(3) ""The Strongest"": Two drivers on a lone highway have an argument with tragic consequences. (4) ""Little Bomb"": The demolition engineer has his car towed by a truck for parking in a wrong place and he has an argument with the employee of the towing company. This event destroys his private and professional life, and he plots revenge against the corrupt towing company and the City Hall.(5) ""The Proposal"": The reckless hit-and-run son of a wealthy family hits and kills a pregnant woman. He wakes up his parents and his father calls the lawyer. They propose to pay the groundkeeper to take the blame. Soon the father discovers that he is victim of extortion of his lawyer and the detective in charge of the investigation. What will be his decision?(6) ""Until Death Do Us Apart"": During the wedding party, the wife discovers that her husband has cheated her with one of the guests and decides to payback. ""Relatos Salvajes"" is an insane and funny comedy, with great critic to the corruption of the public services in Argentina (but could be in most of the South American countries); to the corrupt elite and police; to the lack of justice. It is hard to choose the best segment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Relatos Selvagens"" (""Wild Reports"")"
37,Wild Tales,8,7 April 2015,Not 100% brilliant but most of it superb.  Enthralling and hilarious.,"Pedro Almodovar produced this suite of six short films all based on the theme of revenge, written and directed by Argentinian filmmaker Damián Szifrón and at times astoundingly photographed by Javier Julia.(His use of bokeh in the final film on a Buenos Aires Rooftop is particularly worthy of merit  but I apologise for even mentioning it because I know how wonky that reads;)So, in six short films there will be winners and losers and to get the bad news out of the way quickly they slightly outstay their welcome towards the end, partly because we've worked out how Szifrón thinks and so we can spot the plot twists a little too early.But put that to one side and you have a sextet of extraordinarily original little gems.The advantage of being penned, directed and shot by the same team is that they really do hang together as a unit and there are a number of sit up in your seat bolt upright moments along with number of belly laughs.The first of the six is something of a premonition of the Germanwings disaster but with a huge dollop of humour built in.What follows includes a number of automotive moments. Two of them have road rage at their core (or at least road tax rage) and both stand out.The movie was nominated for the Foreign language Oscar but faced pretty stiff competition this year.Me? I think we'll be seeing a lot more of Szifrón. It reminds me (in a different way of Amores Perros in that it uses a short film format to establish the credentials of great south American film making and that didn't do Alejandro González Iñárritu any harm, as he has progressed to nominations for best picture with Babel and then rightfully take home the moolah with Birdman this year.Supreme film making of nearly the highest order."
38,Wild Tales,9,23 March 2015,"4.5 stars... Revenge, Argentine style.","""Wild Tales"" (2014 release from Argentina; 122 min.) is a collection of 6 seemingly unrelated tales which all bear the same theme: revenge. The opening (pre-movie credits) tale is a classic: a woman strikes up a conversation with another airplane passenger and they find out that by complete coincidence (or not?) they are both acquainted with the same person. Then it emerges that several other passengers also know that person... No worries, I'm not going to spoil anything. This first (and short) story sets the mood for the movie perfectly, as we get five more vignettes that are all one better than the other. I can't decide which is my favorite, to be honest.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Argentine writer-director Damian Szifron, and what a beauty he delivers with this movie. When I say ""beauty"", I certainly don't mean it in a sugary way, as in fact Szifron's film can be seen as a brutal assessment of the human condition. Check out the tale of the driver who gets tangled up with a 'left lane bandit' only then to suffer a flat tire and suffer the consequences... Or, even worse (should I say better?), check out the tale of the frustrated guy whose car gets towed without reason (according to the guy, of course), and wants to file a complaint... (this story reminded me of that Michael Douglas film ""Falling Down""). The movie is also a blistering indictment of Argentina's judicial system (check out the story where a well-off family's son kills a pregnant woman in a hit-and-run). The very last story (about a wedding reception that goes horribly wrong) is also the longest (close to 30 min.), and capsules the movie's spirit perfectly. It is no wonder that ""Wild Tales"" was a nominee for Best Foreign Language Movies at this year's Oscars. I've now seen 4 of the 5 nominated films and honestly they are all worthy in their own right, and then some.""Wild Tales"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not super, which is a shame. I had high expectations for ""Wild Tales"" and they were met, and then some. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Wild Tales"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
39,Wild Tales,8,26 August 2014,A roller coaster of acid humor and rage,"Wild stories are just that stories of everyday life that they become violent for different reasons. Each of the stories is not consistent with the others, the only common thread is the violence that is outspread beautifully by Szifron with a photograph (Javier Julia - blessed by fire) and accompanying soundtrack (Gustavo Santaolalla - Biutiful, 21 grams) to the incredible performances by the entire cast. Szifron there led to an elegant widescreen so true human nature and has resulted in these 6 stories that have left everyone wanting more. Without doubt that wild stories is the movie of the year from Argentina."
40,Wild Tales,10,15 January 2015,A masterpiece!,"Just these words, A MASTERPIECE! Once again I can see why Argentina continues to be a country that excels at movie making by just telling human stories. Superior cinema is not about astronomical budgets, overpaid actors, complicated plots. That is why, I highly recommend seeing this film because we can all identify with aspects of one or more of the independent stories portrayed here.The film manages to seamlessly move from a highly tense moment to an amusing one within the situation at hand. This is what makes it brilliant in my opinion. The acting is superb, the directing impeccable. The plots excellent and to the point. Each story is well told, engaging, poignant, suspenseful, intriguing, tense, dramatic and funny. And that is how life is, thus it a film about real life. The lives of all of us."
41,Wild Tales,9,18 April 2015,So Brilliant Even The Opening Credits Is A Masterpiece. ♦ 85%,"This is my first Argentine movie and I am blown away.With an amazing opening sequence, Wild Tales is a collection of six short, unrelated live action tales that depict human nature in its purest form. The stories speak volumes about the types of lives we all live. A conversation at the beginning turns into a startling revelation at the end of the first short, which is as great as the remaining five. However, the final short is slightly dull compared to what the first five have to offer.Black comedy is the perfect genre this would fall in because the short tales are about ordinary people finding themselves in ordinary situations. The only factor that distinguishes it from the rest is that it goes ahead turning the ordinary into something wicked and super. It is a mix of drama and quirkiness that we all are accustomed to. And the best part is that the stories are to the point.Definitely the film is for people who have an eye for humor and cinematic art. You will love and cherish this and yearn to re-watch it. Excellent photography, backed by good writing and appropriate music. The score is so supportive, one awaits it in the screenplay. With some great performances and direction, Wild Tales is an appealing drama which will appeal even if you do not understand Spanish. BOTTOM LINE: Wild Tales is a masterpiece and once you watch it, you will be asking your friends to watch it just so you can discuss it with them. 9/10 - brilliant!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
42,Wild Tales,9,17 March 2015,"What Happens When You Really, REALLY Lose It!","This 2015 Argentinian film, directed by Damián Szifron, is a collection of six unconnected short stories, with both comic and catastrophic elements and carrying the tagline ""we can all lose control."" The six very different stories describe ""how I would extract my revenge if only I had the nerve."" The excellent ensemble cast keeps the unexpected happening . . . as people go to the surreal brink of absurdity and tragedyand keep going. They carry out the vengeful urges we all feel in moments of betrayal, in flashes of road rage, facing overwhelming temptation, or confronting mindless bureaucracy. The first very short tale involves a casual conversation between two airplane passengers, strangers to each other, who happen to discover they both know a would-be musician named G-- Pasternak. One is a woman who once broke up with him and the other, a classical music critic who savaged Pasternak's early work. A passenger sitting in front of them turns around, saying, ""Pasternak?"" She was his elementary school teacher, and says he certainly had problems. After a few more people who've wronged poor Pasternak pipe up, the music critic stands and asks, ""Is there anybody on this plane who does not know Pasternak? And who paid for their own ticket?"" There is not. I leave the rest to your imagination. And his. The funniest story involves an explosives expert trying to reason with the local parking authority, and one of the most satisfying has a bride take her revenge on the groom who cheated on her. It's a wedding no one will ever forget! Said Eric Kohn in indieWIRE, ""While adhering to an internal logic that makes each punchline land with a satisfying burst of glee, the movie nevertheless stems from genuine fury aimed a broken world."" Be sure to catch the opening credits, where the names of key cast and production crew members are shown with photos of wild animals reflecting on their personas. The director, I noted, was a fox. An Academy Award nominee for best foreign language film last year."
43,Wild Tales,8,21 February 2015,Civilization and its Discontents,"""Wild Tales"" (Relatos Salvajes) is not based (as far as I know) on the transcendental Freud's essay, but it really could be an adapted screenplay from that. The film has become one of the most graphic, accurate and enthralling depiction of what modern times are doing to modern people. It is hard not to feel portrayed by these hyperbolic and extremely appealing characters and situations, despite the fact that none of us (and I hope it will never happen) have to live the extreme circumstances shown in this movie. In terms of cinematography this film is flawless: stylistic and technique are subordinated to storytelling in a way we don 't see in many movies. In terms of the tonal range is wide and empathic, with a chord of healthy black humor running underneath the six stories. These actors and actresses are well known and very much loved here in Argentina: Darin, Sbaraglia, Martinez and the AMAZING Erica Rivas (for those who have seen the film this name is unforgettable); they deliver some of the best performances in years of excellent and high quality acting careers. ""Wild Tales"" is a complex construction of ""right on target"" choices, solid screenplay, skillful direction, and superb acting. And above all else the feeling of what movies mean to us: a particular time and space where we can see the best and the worst of us, to make our lives better. I can't recommend it hard enough!"
44,Wild Tales,,19 April 2015,Anger And Frustration,"""Relatos Salvajes"" or ""Wild Tales"" is an anthology movie, consisting of six short tales, produced by Pedro Almodovar.One of the tales has, due to to the news involving airplanes we have seen over the past year, taken on quite a different meaning. Especially the tragedy involving Germanwings Flight 9525 and pilot Andreas Lubitz. I don't want to give away too much, suffices to say, that the impact of the story is felt quite vividly given what I have just mentioned.These tales touch on topics such as anger, frustration, revenge and feeling under pressure in our mad- dash, non-stop 21st century lives. Always connected, always on, always moving, and the resulting alienation, fragmentation and uncertainty which results out of all that.We feel it every day, in ourselves, in those around us, the places we live in, the uneasiness in our souls, minds and bodies...the feeling that we are no longer in control of our own being, or our destiny...only perpetual tourists relegated to a dystopian conveyor belt composed of regretful pasts, crumbling presents and a myriad of possible shaky futures.These tales encompass all of that in some form or other. Thoughts and emotions we are likely to dismiss and not dwell on in our daily lives and routines. Let's be honest, who amongst us wants to think about anger and frustration...when they are our most likely companions during the mundane process of going about to and fro', aka living? But anger and frustration, and yes even revenge, are part of our personalities, and of us as human beings.Without darkness there is no light. In the same manner, we would probably be incomplete humans without anger, frustration and revenge being part of us.It is about time we acknowledge them. This movie does just that...in a wonderful way!"
45,Wild Tales,8,6 April 2015,Lived Up To Expectations,"The movie definitely paid homage quite well to Pedro Almodovar who produced this, he is the master of absurdist anger and chaos and this director made a case for himself as somebody who can carry that torch. If you enjoy sharp social critiques about what drives us crazy in modern society, this is for you. There was also some not very subtle swipes at the upper classes and some commentary about how corruption is so normalized in Argentinian society. Despite being bleak, the movie was visually appealing and had a great soundtrack that did not overwhelm. You will find yourself laughing at some things you hope nobody else notices.Everybody can debate about which of the stories is their personal favorite. There is a little something for everybody. I liked Gabriel Pasternak, the vengeful engineer, and the wedding from hell best but all of the stories were good. I am not overly familiar with Argentinian cinema, I did recognize one of the actors from ""The Secret in Their Eyes,"" it makes me want delve more into the movies of that country. I can see why it was popular there and hopefully it gets the attention it deserves here in the United States."
46,Wild Tales,9,12 May 2015,"""Wild Tales"" is a will-named film, which provides a unique experience.","Truth is stranger than fiction. Or so they say. ""Wild Tales"" (R, 2:02) is complete fiction, but is strange enough to compete with any truth you may have seen portrayed on film. Still, the word ""strange"" doesn't adequately describe the things that happen in this movie. ""Wild"" really is the best adjective for the film's content. The wildest part of the whole thing is that anything and everything portrayed on the screen could actually happen. In fact, some of it did. The film's opening scenes depict a scenario that is uncomfortably similar to an infamous real-life tragedy that took place in early 2015. ""Too soon,"" is the phrase I heard one woman whisper to her companion after the movie's opening sequence. It may seem that way, but this film was released in Argentina and shown at several film festivals around the world well before the tragedy to which I am referring. This just goes to show the plausibility, if not the truth, behind the stories in this film. Yes, that's ""stories""  plural.""Wild Tales"" is an anthology of six stories with no relation to each other, except that they all portray violent revenge. I think it's also worth noting that, on the Rotten Tomatoes website, this film received a positive rating of over 90% of critics AND moviegoers  and lead to Argentina being represented in the 2014-2015 Oscar race for Best Foreign Language Film. (The movie's Spanish language title is ""Relatos salvajes"".) Yes, that means hearing the dialog in Spanish and reading it in English, but these six tales are wild enough that most people probably won't mind the subtitles:A group of seemingly unrelated people gathered together in one place discover that they have something in common. Is it a cosmic-level coincidence or is there something else going on?A waitress in a diner is forced to serve a gangster whose actions basically destroyed the waitress' family and he doesn't even recognize her. Upon hearing her story, the cook suggests putting rat poison in the man's food, but can the waitress bring herself to be that ruthless? Then, a road rage incident near a bridge on a deserted stretch of road escalates to disgusting and dangerous levels and neither driver gets away unscathed. Karma can really be a bitch!An ordinary man (who happens to have an extraordinarily dangerous occupation) has his car towed while picking up his daughter's birthday cake. This frustrating situation sets off a chain of events that ruins the man's life. He falls down so far that he has nothing to lose by taking his revenge on a corrupt and uncaring system.When the son of a rich man is involved in a hit-and-run, the rich man offers to pay his groundskeeper to take the rap. The groundskeeper agrees, but enacting this plan is not nearly as simple as it sounds and this story ends in a way none of the players expected.An attractive young couple are enjoying their wedding reception when the bride makes a discovery that shakes her to her core. She chooses the bridal dance as the time to tell her new husband what she has learned. Without spilling the specifics, I can say that all this leads to a dramatic rooftop scene, tension and tempers rising to a fever pitch, blood on the bride's dress, paramedics treating multiple people with a variety of conditions and a cutting-the-cake scene that you won't soon forget. Suffice it to say that producers Pedro and Agustín Almodóvar and writer/director Damián Szifron saved the wildest (and possibly the best) wild tale for last. In ""Wild Tales"", you get a series of revenge fantasies that may make you feel guilty for allowing them to entertain you. But it will probably be a pleasurable guilt. It's the kind of movie that makes you think, ""I can't believe they did that,"" immediately followed by, ""I wonder if I would do that."" Even with real-world events tinging the first story with an unintended pathos, this film gives us six tales that represent the best in dark comedy. The situations showcased are generally relatable and seem uncomfortably possible. The many movies I've seen over the years have left me with just about every conceivable emotion upon leaving the theater, but this is the first one that left me feeling naughty. For lack of a better word, I felt naughty for secretly rooting for people doing bad things in this movie  and for enjoying the outcome of each story as much as I did. I've never seen a movie like this before, never felt the way this movie made me feel and never enjoyed dark comedy so much. This is going to make me feel naughty all over again, but I'm giving ""Wild Tales"" an ""A"". I'm sorry. No, I'm not."
47,Wild Tales,10,13 March 2015,"An extraordinary good movie, talented, funny, profound, sensitive","This movie was unexpectedly enjoyable. We laughed, admired the writing, the pictures and the acting. A splendid combination of humor, great scenario, great actors, great director and fantastic director of photography. I loved it, each story is a jewel, with incredible funny details, and a perfect sense of progression and dramatic moves. Human imagination at its best! How can some people hate and destroy culture, forbidding movies, music, painting, dancing, theater, etc. : this movie is a triumph of culture and talent, and it makes life lighter, witty and enjoyable. This is the best cure for anyone feeling desperate or depressed, you will come out reinvigorated and looking at life with more forgiveness. A must go movie."
48,Wild Tales,10,9 March 2015,Amazing! You don't need to understand Spanish to enjoy this movie.,"This movie will share with you some essence of the Argentinean culture. The plots have a reasonable foundation, although being taken to an extreme. It has some added sense of humour which we have enjoyed. A 'must see' movie. The cast is top of the line, the acting impeccable, and the direction superb. Each individual tale is fantastic.To my fellow Argentineans that have emigrated many years ago: you have to see this movie because it will bring you back sweet memories of our country, it is a satiric reminder of our culture, and you will be thrilled of watching on the big screen our youth favorite actors.Well worth the two hours plus of this movie. You will not be disappointed. Time flies, taking you from one tale to the next, and each story will grab your attention in less than a minute."
49,Wild Tales,8,8 December 2014,Carefully structured black comedy,"""If poison reaches its expiration date, does that mean that it is more or less effective?""Wild Tales (Relatos Salvages), written and directed by Damian Szifron, is Argentina's official submission in the category of best foreign language film for next year's Academy Awards. I find it hard to review these anthology films at times considering some of the short stories work really well while others don't. In Wild Tales, Szifron manages to structure the film beautifully into six stories with a great sense of pacing and storytelling. The two hours flew by and I never found any of the stories tedious or boring. When making an anthology it is important that you establish an important connection between each story, and Szifron manages to do just that. Each story focuses on characters who in some way seem to lose control and act out on impulse or revenge. It's a film about our reactions and how we can behave as animals at times. Szifron manages to set a dark tone in each of his stories while keeping the audience in suspense during some scenes and exploding in laughter during others. It is a perfect example of a dark comedy that manages to maintain the thrills throughout the narrative. Szifron plays with the genre conventions and balances the different tones of the film very well. It's hard to point out a weak link because each story brings something different to the film, but at the same time they all feel connected. Szifron cleverly satirizes different institutions in each of his six segments including marriage, justice, bureaucracy, and social classes. Wild Tales is a well executed and entertaining film, and one that might turn out to be a contender at next year's Oscars. One major issue with anthology films is that since they are separate short stories we get little time to invest in each of the characters, but somehow Szifron manages to establish each character in each scenario so well that we end up caring for them. The performances are all solid. The only familiar face in the cast is Ricardo Darin who delivers his segment extremely well. He plays a disillusioned character who is tired of the bureaucracy in his country. It doesn't take much to see him explode and we see how one small incident escalates into an overblown reaction. As much as I enjoyed that segment, it wasn't the most memorable one. I was a huge fan of the road rage segment, which in my opinion was the highlight of this film. Juan Pablo Colombo and Walter Donado give terrific performances as they are placed on an everyday scenario in the road which very quickly escalates into cartoonish violence. I could go on mentioning the rest of the segments, but they are all worthwhile. This was a perfectly executed black comedy and one worth checking out."
50,Wild Tales,9,31 October 2014,"Dark, funny, disturbing and ultimately uplifting","Just saw it. Reminds me of Tarantino of course but more of Almodóvar, the first Almodóvar specially, for instance that of ""Matador"". No wonder he decided to produce the film. Szifron is brilliant as a narrator, the screenplay is excellent and for the most part very well acted. Dark, funny, cartoonish. The road rage episode owes a lot to McLaren's ""Neighbours"". Very original and striking, should be very successful. Szifron's strong suit is, I think, not so much the plotting but directing actors. Darín is, as usual, so good you do not notice he is acting. Rivas, in the last episode, as an angry Jewish bride is absolutely sublime. And the fat cook in ""The Rats"", the cafe episode (maybe the least successful but still good), with just one look lets you know that she is a danger to all things alive. Also, it is impossible not to identify with the characters and root for them...Great movie. Go watch it."
51,Wild Tales,10,3 June 2017,Excellent Movie Making,"This is an excellent piece that will entertain you from the very first second to the last. I am looking forward to seeing this movie again with someone that would appreciate it. While it is completely in Argentine Spanish (which is great for me as I am a fluent Spanish-speaker) it has subtitles which are excellent. The combination of acting and story are truly magnificent. Comparing this movie to a Tarantino film is inaccurate, however, this is better than Tarantino. Tarantino's films are mostly satirical. There is no satire in this movie."
52,Wild Tales,9,4 May 2017,"Wildly crazy, witty, entertaining...","I was recommended to watch Relatos salvajes some time ago, but was busy with some series and postponed it, plus I had no clear idea what it was about and how was it structured. But when the 1st tale was approaching its climax, it became evident that many catchy moments would be waiting me... Some parts are less realistic than others, but definitely not airy-fairy, and smart dialogues with distinct performances paved the way for lots of giggling, moments with black humour, and some grisly recognition how easily a rampage can occur... ""El más fuerte"" and ""Bombita"" are the tales I enjoyed most, they seem most sustained and elaborate, the final one - ""Hasta que la muerte nos separe"" - gave me mixed feelings and I found that its pace was somewhat uneven, rounding up the all bunch in less interesting manner, but still, after some delay time and considering the film comes from Argentina, I have decided to give 9 points - the film in question is highly recommended to all fond of dissimilar productions and approaches."
53,Wild Tales,9,13 November 2016,Wonderfully entertaining with twists and unconventional style,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Went in blind not knowing what to expect. The movie centers around 6 separate scenes dealing with anger. They are all thoroughly engaging, making the viewer sit on the edge of their seat with anxious expectation of how it might end. Extremely clever and get to the real core of the key characters. You feel like you know this person or have met someone just like him/her. What stands out for this film is the intense emotion (without unnecessary drama), just real life expression of how the mundane can turn crazy. Often there is a twist or two hidden into each story which adds further delight to the story. Overall this movie is one I will certainly recommend to friends and continue to stay with me , especially the motor car story"
54,Wild Tales,10,16 October 2016,wow,"One of the best movies I have ever seen, the direction is superb, I didn't know anything about this movie, just another monotone foreign movie I thought, but no my expectations were blown away in the first 20 minutes, I won't give away anything, but if you haven't seen this movie, go and see it, it is explosive on a nuclear scale.The movie makes you think the world is crazy it's not us, whatever your problem is, leave it at the door, take your medication before watching this movie, this is one of those movies you have got to see with other people because it is so crazy, and you can talk about it with your friends later in days to come because this movie will stick in your mind and not let go."
55,Wild Tales,9,29 August 2016,"Forget Wild, These Tales Are Savage!","This is a very watchable and often extremely funny anthology of six short films. The dialogue is in Spanish, the director and settings are Argentine. The stories are all slightly-over-the-top-realism in the manner of Almodóvar tinged with the dark surrealism of the Buñuel of The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. The scenarios are graphic rather than subtle, but they all work well most of the time, because most of us can identify with the main characters, recognizing how little it can take to shake us from complacency into violence.The official English title ""Wild Tales"" suggests madcap craziness. But these tales are savage (""selvaje"" in the original Spanish), a word that better suggests the ferocious beast lurking not far under the skin of all of us. The beast can be unchained by nothing more complicated than being cut off by a driver who doesn't signal or finding that our car has been impounded for an unwitting parking infraction. In the first and shortest episode, what appears to be an absurd series of coincidences linking all the passengers on a plane turns out to have a logical and sinister rationale. The ending explains why in the opening scene the woman checking in at the airport is told that she will not earn frequent flyer points for her trip! And the final, longest episode hilariously tracks the chaotic degeneration of a stereotypical Jewish wedding party, initiated by the bride's discovery that the groom has been cheating on her with one of the guests. This is not a film for young children or for people who aren't willing to admit how close they sometimes are to dissolving in animal rage."
56,Wild Tales,9,23 July 2016,A surprising and original film,"As I'm working my way through the entire IMDb's top 250, I decided on a whim to watch this odd Argentinian film in-between all the long and slow-paced war epics. And wow! I had no expectations, but each short story caught me off guard and wowed me. And when I thought I got the hang of the style, the fourth part surprised me completely, and then the fifth and final ones did as well!I don't usually like short stories, but this film just works. The theme of ""what may happen when humans are pushed too far"" is fascinating, and it's always unpredictable, imaginative and entertaining. It being beautifully shot and boosts great music seals the deal: This is one of my all-time favorites!"
57,Wild Tales,10,2 June 2016,"Dark, funny and brilliant","Greetings from Lithuania.""Relatos salvajes"" (2014) is a one helluva ride. Can't remember the last time i was simply blown away by a movie, but ""Relatos salvajes"" just did it with my. It brilliantly tells a multiple not connected stories, all filled with bad human behavior - to say the least. I was involved into this movie more then i could have imagined i will be - it is an amazingly involving picture from the very opening shot. All stories are superb, one topping each other with first off all brilliant writing and directing. Writter / director Damián Szifron created this unforgettable movies with many stories, one which you won't forget soon, from which maybe the last ending of the last story went a bit way over the top.Overall, ""Relatos salvajes"" is amazingly dark and funny movie. 2 hours run like a minute, can't remember when i was last time so involved into picture. Acting was outstanding by each and every actor, but the true star in here was a director and writer who did this brilliant job. What a movie..."
58,Wild Tales,10,8 April 2016,Best of argentina movie iv seen...,"Best of argentina movie...yu cant stop it for one time watch.This is a masterpiece, if you are asking yourself whether or not you should watch it stop.. You MUST watch it you will NOT regret it.﻿ Wild Tales is not just a film you'll enjoy. It's one you'll want to talk about when it's over, either to debate the morals of the film - or to convince someone else to watch it. It's crisply and cleanly shot throughout, and the filmmaker shows a rare feel for how to not only make comedy land, but also to make it actually feel cinematic too. Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but Argentine writer-director Damián Szifron allows it to sit until it congeals in the dreary six-part anthology Wild Tales."
59,Wild Tales,9,16 March 2016,Nervous breakdown can b a deadly state.,"The movie is an anthology of short stories. They are funny in an absurd way, and will definitely keep you entertained. The movie is a satire of modern society. Cinematography is wonderfully executed by Javier Julia. Director/Writer Damián Szifrón puts together six different stories that all have nervous breakdown as their common theme. In one of the story, the lead is Ricardo Darín (the secret in their eyes), most of us can rate to the frustration he goes thru before his nervous breakdown. This movie is really about what happens when we let frustration pile up and everything becomes too much at some point. It's about when so much bad stuff happens to you. The acting, direction and cinematography were very good. The first story is the shortest n da best."
60,Wild Tales,10,27 January 2016,One of the most thrilling movie of 2014,"The 6 stories are very good and the direction and acting was mind- blowing. I had zero knowledge of the movie before watching, just started watching it after noticing it's good IMDb rating. But oh my God after first 5 minutes I was like: ""This movie is really different"" . Every story endings are very unusual and full of humor. I will always recommend this movie to the people who are open to a thrilling movie. My favorite story among the stories is the story with the Audi car owner's awkward dispute with a fellow driver. And the last story around a marriage ceremony was little unrealistic, still you will wonder what just happened after watching that part. So many things happened on their wedding night.So fellas, go for this movie. 10/10 from me."
61,Wild Tales,9,3 January 2016,A very entertaining movie that makes you smile intelligently,"The movie is a satire of modern Argentinian society that can easily be expanded to other countries. 6 very well acted and directed short stories have a common a desire of revenge against what they perceived, rightly or not, as a big or small injustice against them. All the episodes are an exaggeration of real life circumstances that all of us have been in (revenge against somebody who mistreated you, against a criminal, against the government's injustice, against the arrogance of some individuals and against a disrespectful partner). The dark hyperbole that permeates all the short stories gives the movie a very tragicomic vibe. 1) Acting: very well acted throughout, with a top notch performance by Ricardo Darin and Erica Rivas. 2) Directing: very entertaining and fluid, especially in the last short story. 3) Screenplay: short dark stories are not new in the Latin cinema, especially in the tradition of Italian movies in 60s-70s (""I mostri"", ""ieri, oggi e domani"", ""I nuovi mostri""). However, even if the formula lacks of originality, the short stories are engaging in their plot and they are very well built and concluded in the time allocated 4) Quit fitting especially in the episode of the ""road tale"" and memorable is the ""titanium"" opening in the last short story. 4) Overall: a very entertaining movie that makes you smile intelligently"
62,Wild Tales,10,13 September 2015,Long story the film is finished !,"Instead of ordinary film based on the story of a single , brief but dramatic legend tells the story of the film. Each story in itself a major It has been working . Nevertheless, if are forced to get rid of stereotypes . Argentina has also made ​​a film that allows the formation of a warm atmosphere. You have to hand it to the director , the film was actually shot very natural . Human certainly this film he gets carried away . As a Turk , I also would like to express my own people likened to Argentine . Finally, he told us something else by the last part of the director. Review should not miss . Pleasure to be followed , go to a movie avail of a second."
63,Wild Tales,8,1 August 2015,"Sweet revenge, or why we need Anger Management","Damián Szifrón is the Argentine writer director (with producer backup from Agustín and Pedro Almodóvar) who present us with a series of stories that present the human animal and how it reacts to stress: six dark stories, involving six savage situations full of revenge and the dark sides of human beings - dreadful revenge to hated persons, accidental or intentional, dangerous and unexpected arguments, misunderstandings, and horrid confrontations that permanently change the lives of people involved. The film is advertised as wildly funny, and perhaps if we all view human foibles and anger management crises as food for laughter then the term comedy is appropriate. What the audience sees are situations most of us confront daily (on a much more quiet level)  frustrations with politics, misunderstandings of conversations, immediate flash hate responses like road rage, jealousies mishandled, bullying  and because we can relate to each of these stories the film works.Briefly, the six stories have been summarized as '1) ""Pasternak"": one model and a music critic in a plane find that they have a common acquaintance called Pasternak. Soon they discover that every passenger and crew on board know Pasternak. Cosmic coincidence? (2) ""The Rats"": a waitress of a diner recognizes her client as the loan shark that caused a tragedy in her family. The cook suggests mixing rat poison in his food, but she refuses. But the cook decides to proceed in her plan. When his son arrives, the waitress tries to fix the situation. (3) ""The Strongest"": Two drivers on a lone highway have an argument with tragic consequences. (4) ""Little Bomb"": The demolition engineer has his car towed by a truck for parking in a wrong place and he has an argument with the employee of the towing company. This event destroys his private and professional life, and he plots revenge against the corrupt towing company and the City Hall. (5) ""The Proposal"": The reckless hit-and-run son of a wealthy family hits and kills a pregnant woman. He wakes up his parents and his father calls the lawyer. They propose to pay the groundkeeper to take the blame. Soon the father discovers that he is victim of extortion of his lawyer and the detective in charge of the investigation. What will be his decision? (6) ""Until Death Do Us Apart"": During the wedding party, the wife discovers that her husband has cheated her with one of the guests and decides to payback.'Stylish photography, a fine cast of basically unknown actors (with major exceptions) and excellent direction make this macabre human comedy work. This won top honors in Argentina"
64,Wild Tales,8,28 July 2015,"6 stories, 1 motive","That's one of the sickest (literally) intros to a movie that I have ever had the chance to see. I immediately knew that I'll be on the edge of my seat for the next 2 hours. And indeed I was. Sadly, although 6 very great stories, I really wish they we're either a bit longer, or they'd share a bit more than the motive of revenge alone. Couldn't really get my self to connect to the characters (probably 'cause they we're all so f'd up) but I somehow managed to get past it, and really enjoy watching their craziness develop. I gave it a solid 8/10, would definitely watch again.P.S.: I always thought my wedding would be weird, but damn, that is one hell of a screwed up wedding."

The best; the beginning and the end, I think that the order of the stories are given so that we depress so much. I cant believe cant write in Spanish..."
66,Wild Tales,9,23 August 2014,a window to Argentina,"Szifron shows he knows what he's doing. His acid humor, his sarcastic view of some Argentinian myths, a painful picture of our violent society.Enough blood to make us realize the outcome of violence, enough hate we usually hide, enough laughs to make the film highly enjoyable,enough love to clear the way. A film called to move spectators, not only from the River Plate area or the Spanish speaking countries. A film which shows the main wounds in the present Argentinian society,the system's corruption,the lies, the class struggle, the privileged ones. A film which is an open and crystal-clear window to Southamerica urban reality."
67,Wild Tales,9,8 March 2015,Reflects the insanity of contemporary existence.,"Though Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind,"" many of us deal with the frustrations of modern life by striking out against a society we see as oppressive. We rail against the politicians who misgovern us, the bureaucrats we tangle with, or simply against a world that does not always support our desires. Most express their anger in socially acceptable ways, others do not. It is the others that are the subject of Argentine director Damián Szifrón's (On Probation) Wild Tales, six unrelated stories filled with dark humor, stylized violence, unhinged emotions, and unexpected twists in the Twilight Zone tradition, tales that reflect the insanity of contemporary existence.Produced by Pedro Almodovar (I'm Not Excited) and nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, the assortment of characters that populate Wild Tales are not poster boys for forgiveness but are united in their desire for revenge against real or imagined enemies. Though in films of this genre, the expectation is that some segments will be better than others, here each twenty-minute segment is so impeccably written and compelling that they could each form the basis for a feature-length film. In ""Pasternak,"" the bizarre episode that opens the film, Isabel (Maria Marull, Antes del estreno), an attractive model, boards a plane for a business trip and strikes up a conversation with Salgado (Dario Grandinetti, Inevitable), a music critic, seated across the aisle. After she tells him about her ex-boyfriend Gabriel Pasternak, he tells her that he also knows him as an aspiring classical music composer.Salgado relates how he emphatically rejected one of his compositions, though he recognizes his words may have hurt. Other passengers overhear the conversation and stand up to claim that they also know Pasternak and have mistreated him in one way or another. The sequence ends on a note that is so delightfully macabre that it cannot and should not be described but must be seen. In ""The Rats,"" the film's second vignette, a waitress (Julieta Zylberberg, Extraños en la noche) in a restaurant encounters a nasty customer (Cesar Bordon, History of Fear) whom she recognizes as the loan shark who was responsible for her father's suicide.She would like him to suffer but is unwilling to do anything about it until her determined cook (Rita Cortese, Verdades, Verdaderes, la vida de Estala), speaking from experience, tells the waitress that prison is not so bad after all and decides to take matters into her own hand. Revenge escalates in ""Road to Hell,"" a road-rage segment reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Duel. A well-to-do man (Leonardo Sbaraglia, Aire libre), driving an upscale Audi sports car on a lonely stretch of road, has some choice remarks for the driver (Walter Donado, The Road to San Diego) of a slow-moving pickup truck who refuses to let him pass. Called a ""redneck,"" the fun starts when the businessman has a flat tire and the confrontation escalates in very imaginative and bloody ways.Other stories deal with an engineer (Ricardo Darin, Violet) whose car is towed away once too often for his emotional well being, and a wealthy father (Oscar Martinez, Empty Nest) who tries to cover up for his teenage son's involvement in a fatal automobile accident with a scheme that involves payoffs to his lawyer, the family gardener, the prosecuting attorney and the police. The final segment, ""Till Death Us Do Part,"" is, both literally and figuratively, the icing on the cake. In the episode, a lavish wedding becomes sidetracked when the bride Romina (Erica Rivas, Aire libre) discovers that her new husband and Ariel (Diego Gentile, The Hush) had an affair with one of the wedding guests.The wedding bouquet becomes a dart thrown in several directions as the celebration turns into a mixture of blood and wedding cake. The most commercially successful Argentine movie in history, Wild Tales is a wild ride that provides the viewer with a sense of how losing control may be cathartic and fun on a movie screen but counterproductive in our own life. As one of the characters in the film says, it may be better to just accept that bureaucracy will find a way to get most of your money no matter what and move on with your life, because in that way you'll live longer than if you give the unfairness of the matter any prolonged thought. That is probably good advice, that is, unless you find the idea of revolution attractive."
68,Wild Tales,8,25 January 2015,Track it down.,"Here is an interesting work from Argentina. It will not get wide distribution but it is worth the time and energy to track it down.The movie consists of six short movies. Most of which if presented alone would be award worthy live action shorts.There is plenty of black comedy that works. There is a level of violence that some may find disturbing. Some of the excellent acting performances are lost while reading subtitles. If a particular story doesn't work for you, not to.worry it will on to the next one fast enough.You may not easily find this in a theater, but it is worth watching on a platform in the comfort of your home."
69,Wild Tales,10,14 June 2015,Wild Tales indeed,"I went in this completely unprepared (as I like to do in general) having not read a single thing. I recognized one of the actors on the poster and have generally watched a couple of Spanish language movies that knew how to hit the spot (if that makes sense to you). What I mean is: They know how to make a good movie. And while some might argue that in this case ""movie"" would be an understatement, the whole thing is crazy and every bit of it is great to watch.The beginning alone will or might catch you off-guard. It starts off slow, but once you get the drift of it (no pun intended) you know what this will be about. And it still is able to surprise you. What is not to love here? Well if you are not in the mood or generally don't like that darker touch of humor, you obviously won't be amused or entertained for that matter. For everyone else: Cherish and dig in! Already one of my favorites of this year"
70,Wild Tales,9,25 May 2015,Ordinary people under extraordinary situations.,"Here are six of the most fantastic, nightmarish stories that will depict people unleashing their inner demons under pressure that they have never before experienced in their lives. All have gripping stories filled with a dark humor that will leave your jaws dropping. And mind you, all these are situations that may occur to any of us which is what makes this movie even more interesting. There where places where i felt guilty about laughing but we always laugh at Tom & Jerry which is an entire show where a cat tries to murder a mouse. So i guess i felt guilty here because the characters felt so close and relatable . They say that deep down, people find violence fun and the makers of the movie have fully exploited this innate quality that we all possess. This was definitely a fun experience and it's mere uniqueness makes it worthy of IMDb top 250 list but i think it will not last long as it is already way below at 235 and only about 40k people have rated it."
71,Wild Tales,3,23 February 2015,short hit and long miss,"This film isn't deserving of the excess of praise it has been lauded with. It's entertaining, thought provoking at times, but not by a long mile, a master piece. The third short is the most exciting. I would have much preferred this story to have been a main feature length road movie. It captures beautifully the lush landscapes of Argentina, underscored by an 80s Giorgio Moroder music soundtrack. Leonardo Sbraglia is excellent in the lead and so is the insane brute, hot on his heels.By the end of this third short however, the film has climaxed. And there's still more than 1,5 hours to follow. How is that time going to be filled? More shorts follow where the corruption of humans is exposed and offset against pitch black humour. They are criticisms against sick modern day over-bureaucratic societies, in this case Argentina (but it could be transposed to most other parts of the world). It shows how people create hell for each other; and how some puncture that infernal catch 22 to cathartic effect. It does a decent enough job at it. The 6th and last short film is a relentless frenzy of noise and visual chaos, and fittingly so, the story is also a convoluted mess. Unfortunately this short is the longest of them all. It makes the entire film end on a bum note for me. Annihilating all the goodwill, the director had garnered from me up until then.It made me realise that at no single point during any of the shorts, had I been emotionally touched, nor did I have a moment of intellectual revelation. The film is made up of smoke and mirrors, hiding the fact that there's no heart in the film. Nor is it a product of a great mind; just some half-finished ideas strung together to add up to the duration of one long feature. It's simply one of those movies that a certain public must see and talk highly of, because it's a case of the Emperor's new clothes, really."
72,Wild Tales,7,21 November 2014,¿Main Course or Six Appetizers?,"There is much to praise about ""Relatos Salvajes"", and some in less extent to criticize. The positive in this episodic weaving of tales has most likely been said and repeated: stories are engrossing, ultimately effective in their message and of brutal pace and delivery. But what subtracts the movie of it's peak is the format. Granted, the format IS the movie; but we've seen coral stories work much better with the thematic cord weaving it into one common paste without abrupt cuts (Crash, Pulp Fiction). The division of short stories can be as rewarding as it is conflicting: some stories are better than others (which ones are subjective to the viewer, you). This results in a roller coaster in which one cannot settle comfortably. The better stories need more time and the worst ones have too much of it.In my case, I thought the wedding one was too much, and the airplane too little. Almost certainly this unevenness will compute to other viewers with their own particular tastes, who will prefer the whole over the parts if they adore it and divide the parts from the whole if they didn't. Although there is a common subject, and it is quite evident; I felt displaced when a story ended and another began. Unfilled. They weren't all in the same quality league (acting, pace, themes) and as such it felt like puzzle pieces some too big and some too small.The whole is approved, no doubt. It all depends if you want the main course or six appetizers to go. I felt a little hungry after leaving, but I could go back to the restaurant again."
73,Wild Tales,9,30 November 2014,Maybe the best movie I have seen this year!,"Being a guy who works in advertising, I have always admired the quality of Argentinian storytelling in short format. They probably are the best in our industry. So, when I heard that this movie was Argentinian and that it was composed of 6 shorts films put together I felt instant curiosity, and went to the nearest cinema. The movie starts with a short story on a plane, which lasts only a few minutes but gets you hooked and in the mood to see a lot more.Every story is separated from the rest and there is absolutely no connection between them. Well, actually, the stories have one thing in common: all of them spiral into disaster. And all them do while making you laugh all along.So, if you want to have a good time, and come out of the cinema feeling that you have just watched a great movie (and in my opinion that does not happen too often), you should definitely pencil a session in your diary at the earliest possible time. You may even want to pencil a second session, if like me, you feel like watching it again!"
74,Wild Tales,10,7 February 2015,"Caused me feel fun, anxious, despaired, outraged","I am reluctant to see movies that everybody recommends. My girlfriend finally draw me to the cinema and I was ready to criticize and yawn. Out of the six stories, I did found some plots that could have deserved some improvement to my taste, but they nevertheless unleashed many strong and somehow contradicting feelings at the same time. I believe that each of the wild tales triggers different feelings to each viewer, and I am sure indifference or boredomness are not part of those. At some point it was inevitable to recognize or imagine yourself or someone you know in some characters. Or wonder what would you do in similar situations. I left the cinema with a grin, but also anxious, fearful, despaired, outraged... a very strange mixture of feelings. For weeks I quoted parts of this movie to illustrate a point when discussing with friends and even in professional talks at work. To me, movie watching is mostly about creating emotions and moving you out of the comfort zone. This one made it masterfully, and that explains the rate."
75,Wild Tales,10,4 January 2015,A terrific black comedy,"If this movie plays anywhere in your area RUN to see it. It was the most entertaining black comedy I have seen in years. I just saw this film with a packed house at the Palm Springs Film Festival. Rousing applause at the conclusion of the film. The film contained 6 unrelated tales of revenge. If the film ended after just story 1, I would have gotten my money's worth. That's how great this movie is! The director spoke after the film ended and said part of each story was experienced by him . That statement received a huge round of laughter from the audience. Once you see this film you will understand why. Great musical score enhanced the enjoyment of each story. All the actors were perfect for their roles."
76,Wild Tales,9,8 December 2014,A great dark story that depicts regular humans having their most wild revenge acts executed,"This is easily my Latin American candidate for the 2016 Best Foreign Movie at the Oscar Ceremony; 'Wild Tales' has that Argentinean comedic expertise, with a dark touch that one rarely sees in LATAM movies. The movie shows that Damián Szifron has a great understanding of what needs to be done in order to maintain the stakes high for the sake of creating meaningful characters and have us routing for the evil side. I was grabbed from the first frame of the first story: set in a crazy and surrealistic plane in which all the passengers and attendants are acquainted to one-single guy, this first story shows that every minute of absurd violence becomes an experience that we want not to end.The common theme vengeance is marvelously executed as the narrative weaves between the wonderfully shot and wickedly paced shorts. It's liberating watching a movie that uses a non-traditional structure in which each plot is actually transformed by it's theme. Cinematography is wonderfully executed by Javier Julia, as he creates some sort of unity between the shorts by using witty and clever angles to depict emotion and enhance the overall theme.Watch it! You'll team up on the side of the revengeful and wicked characters. I promise."
77,Wild Tales,,17 February 2015,Born to be.....,"Surprise, surprise. A wide (kinda) release for a Spanish language film, that's sub-titled, in a region such as this, where even film festivals struggle to find an audience (other than for 'those' 'specialty' flicks). Needless to say, anything that supposedly corrupts audience members in this region has been excised, so you can be sure that your moral compass remains intact even after viewing the sinful acts committed by the main leads in the 6 shorts that unfold.The first one, beginning something as a slow-burn dramatic thriller, was the perfect kinda short to grab everyone's attention by the eyeballs with its pitch-perfect/ironically poetic denouement.The 2nd one, consistently enough, continues the introduced theme of revenge, while being consistently slow-burn enough, ends with an appropriate (although a tad lesser) display of irony.The 3rd one, on the other hand, plays out like Steven Spielberg's 'Duel', or 'Joyride', and is very tight, perhaps the tightest of the bunch, and very effective. Overarching the theme of revenge, and a huge touch of irony towards its final sequences, especially, make it really special, almost dominating the very strong initial short.This almost immediately leads into the 4th segment - almost the longest of them all, and sets up the main lead as a lone/reluctant crusader against the typical stuff one Has to Put Up With nowadays, a la 'Falling down', or its local cousin, 'Dombivli Fast'. however, in spite of the time spent in characterization and the ironic sense of revenge, and pride, I felt it was the weakest of the bunch, since there was no sense of a hard payoff. However, this one had the strongest lead of them all, the Argentine De Niro - Ricardo Darin (Carancho / El secreto de sus ojos). The one that comes next though, sweeps aside the theme of revenge, but follow up on a theme introduced in its previous segment, Bombita, of a corrupt system allowing certain perpetrators of crime not to pay the price, for a (ahem) price. The sense of irony, though, is at its strongest in the narrative of this segment, especially when one of the characters who's been meek and kinda cowed down by circumstances starts exhibiting atypical responses, that lead to...ahem...you gotta watch it, and enjoy it.The final segment, embraces irony completely, and keeps you guessing right until its denouement, while eschewing revenge (umm, some might say its all about that emotion though - not for me) almost completely in favor of something even nastier, cutting-edge, and something that hurts immediately, right out in the open, almost completely naked (emotion). Powerful stuff, and wonderful in terms of the milieu against which the entire tale is enacted.A thoroughly entertaining time at the movies, but to be enjoyed theatrically only at a progressive location, unlike where I got to watch."
78,Wild Tales,8,28 February 2015,Revenge is Sweet,"Wild Tales is just that, a six story anthology dealing with revenge. The first and shortest is my personal favorite, is fairly simple. A passenger on an airliner engages in a casual conversation with a man who turns out to be a classical movie critic. They discover that her ex boyfriend was a struggling musician who was ridiculed for his lack of talent by the critic. As the flight continues, as others overhear the first two talking, they all share a link to the failed musician. The ending is great; funny and sick at the same time. Story number two concerns a waitress at a diner who serves a customer who in the past has caused her much misery. He is a nasty politician and, oh boy, does she serve justice. Number three is universal to anyone who has driven a car, as I have, and suffered road rage. An arrogant jerk in a new Audi is driving down a road when he gets stuck behind an old car weaving back and forth. As he is finally able to pass, he curses out the other guy while giving him the finger. A flat tire puts him in a bad situation, as the other man catches up and does things that can't be described in a nice way. Again, a good ending. Short number four is another common theme, a man fighting city hall, in this case a tow truck which costs him both time and money. He fights a losing battle until he uses his expertise from his job to get even. Number five is different in that revenge is not the theme here. A young man comes home distraught at the fact that he has run over a pregnant woman and left the scene. The wealthy dad schemes to hide the accident by using his money and bribing several people. A lesson in greed is the moral. The final segment is a huge wedding party where the newlywed bride discovers that her husband has cheated on her with a guest at the reception. All hell breaks loose, and my least favorite ending. Overall, a good way to be amused for two hours and a 8/10."
79,Wild Tales,8,6 December 2014,Relatos  Salvajes  is  quite  a  solid  anthology,"It's not very common to see an anthology film not belonging to the horror or thriller genres. However, I'm glad to say that the format works pretty well for a tragicomedy... or whatever way you want to classify Relatos Salvajes, because its combination of drama, violence and black humor rejects easy labels, while leaving the spectator satisfied in all those levels. Director and screenwriter Damián Szifrón applies ingenuity to this eclectic combination of tales, whose thematic variety builds an interesting cultural tapestry which isn't only limited to Argentina, because the ethic and ideological conflicts from the characters are universal. The performances are excellent, and the member of the cast who stands out the most is the great Ricardo Darín. A common problem in many anthologies is the fact that the short running time from each segment avoids an adequate establishment of characters and situations, but that wasn't the case in Relatos Salvajes; despite their briefness, the stories feel complete in their structure and development, showing narrative efficiency and a good dominion over the cinematographic language. And the technical aspects are perfect, from Javier Juliá's cinematography to Gustavo Santaolalla's incidental music. I would like to analyze each segment from Relatos Salvajes, but I'm afraid of revealing too much; so, I will only say that my favorite segment was ""Bombita"", while ""Hasta que la Muerte Nos Separe"" was a bit longer than it should have and has some forced details in its story... even though its farcical tone and bittersweet ending work as an appropriate conclusion of the whole film. In conclusion, I wouldn't consider Relatos Salvajes an excellent movie, but I liked it pretty much, and I definitely consider it worthy of a recommendation. Oh, and I would also like to mention the initial credits, which are simple, but full of meaning."
80,Wild Tales,10,28 February 2015,An Argentinian point of view,"I just cannot understand how this movie did not win the Oscar.For the non-Argentinian people who have not watched the movie yet, you may find some details that will not make sense to you, it can be almost offensive, as it is deeply black-humored combined with Argentinian and, why not, Latin-American daily problems that affects society.However, you will be able to understand every revenge feeling, mixed with love and justice; besides, you are going to realize that many of these unbelievable stories may have you as a main character at any time: You will see if your car is parked in the proper place, thinking before having road rage, drinking before driving, cheating on your wife, being a corrupt politician or some seconds before boarding a plane.For me, as an Argentinian, the movie represents many daily situations, even daily life; OUTSTANDING!!!!!"
81,Wild Tales,10,19 December 2014,Excelente,"Excellent mix of comedy and violence. Undoubtedly one of the best films of 2014. From the first minute to the last, is one of those movies that you catch and you do not want it to end. It was highly publicized, which generated expectations before watching it. Collect six different stories that all have revenge as a common theme. While some might be more attractive than others, they all have plenty of black and unpredictable humor. Wild stories have more than enough arguments to be considered a great movie. There are many achievements in the film, and perhaps some issues could be improved, but the film synthesized screenshots of human nature with healthy black humor"
82,Wild Tales,8,21 March 2017,Black comedy that translates well.,"Short story collections rarely work as feature length films, usually because one strand is stronger than others or the overall message is weak or tenuous. Here the links between each tale are subtle genius and as a whole it plays beautifully. Also rare is how well the dark comedy translates from a non English language culture, so universal are the human emotions on display. A perfect blend of drama and pathos across the board. I'll definitely be watching this again and recommending it to people for many years. Well directed, written and acted. Each scenario far fetched yet thoroughly believable. A strong 8/10."
83,Wild Tales,9,20 October 2016,The movie is funny because Argentinians are funny,"I'm not sure if this review will be helpful but I had to get it off my chest as soon as I finished watching: this movie has very heavy content that doesn't fit in what you'd call a comedy. The death of a pregnant woman and her unborn baby by hit-and-run, a child being poisoned, terrorist acts such as a bomb exploding at downtown or an airplane being hijacked with the intent of crashing it; those are horrible tragedies we have no reason to laugh about in real life. Szifrón confessed on an interview his plan was to write possible thrillers and dramas, and ended compiling the 6 wildest scripts for this anthology movie. And the subject of these 6 stories is indeed dramatic and spine-chilling. But...The way Argentinians are, with very witty remarks, proud, acid and not afraid of blurting out curses, the outlandish way how the main characters react on being wronged, and yet surrounding characters still find it humorous (""Bombita"" is cheered on by the average population) or find a way to vent out the pressure of these dark events (""soooo, commissioner: would you state this was a crime of passion?""); THAT's the reason why this is a black comedy. Every line is funny and down-to-earth: believe it or not Argentinians are just like this, especially the father at ""The Deal"". There's a contrast between the horrifying rage expressed physically and the verbal language dismissing the horror of hatred. Yet the terrible consequences are there, inescapable, tearing everyone's life apart.Putting ""Pasternak"" and ""Till Death Do Us Part"" as opening and closing segments set the comedic tone: they're so bizarre that they can, in the proverbial saying, actually ""get away with murder"". Sbaraglia, Darín and Martínez are well cast in the more dramatic parts, they have great acting weight and are very known in their country and abroad. And yet the portrayed events in those tragedy/terror segments still gave me a half shocked-half smiling face. Daaayum.Wild Tales is a walk on the wild side of revenge, indignation, insanity and (very) Argentinian demeanor. Enjoy it as that."
84,Wild Tales,9,5 March 2016,aka 'One Thing Leads to Another till BAM' - the comedy!,"I'd like to imagine that if Luis Bunuel's grandson (or maybe grand-daughter, who knows) had the same temperament and filmmaking go-for-broke sense of death-defying comedic satire, and grew up on a diet of Tarantino scripts, he/she might make something like Wild Tales. Or perhaps there's also a touch of Kafka to some of this - people who are put into completely insane situations that start from something typical (a guy who flips off or a guy getting flipped off while driving, or a guy getting his car towed), or not so much (a groom's infidelity discovered by the bride right in the middle of the wedding reception, or a negotiation by rich men over how to save a kid from going to jail for running someone over).In either case, there's a totally bizarre streak that is aimed largely at people who are pretty well off, and the violent, rather macabre circumstances that occur to them. There's no connecting characters from one short to the next, unlike some anthology films out there, but it's certainly a film that connects the threads together like a book of short stories does. It's almost the kind of film I don't want to tell you too much about before you see it; I knew relatively little except that it had been up for the Golden Palm and an Oscar a year or so ago, and that it was produced by Pedro Almodovar (and for the latter, he rarely produces outside of his own work, so it must mean something major).I can tell you that all but one of the shorts is astonishingly good (""The Deal"" is the one that is just alright, though it still is well directed and acted, with an interesting conclusion, just not the strongest narrative thrust - the one short that might've worked better as a scene in another, full feature film). If there's another connecting thread it's that the stories feature escalation of some kind from one small thing into something that mushrooms. This is highlighted most by a scene involving two motorists, which makes, for lack of a better comparison, Duel look like kids playing with toys as far as brutal mania goes.It's not like things go crazy right off; the shell of civilization and often having to be proper in a setting is highlighted, like at a DMV or at a wedding or on an airplane or even as simple as serving someone in a small town diner. Some of the characterizations are certainly nuts for some of the people, but that's part of the fun for me. Seeing the screws turned by the filmmaker, Damián Szifrón, is a real joy and there's a sense of inspiration from one episode to the next - how will can things really get? A lot of this is genuinely unexpected, and it's more-so based on behavior (again, a good number of the characters here are well-dressed, upper-middle class, again the sort of figures Bunuel went after from time to time, though minus the religious side of things).But more than anything it's about something which is ripe for the darkest comedy (though an undercurrent of severity runs in it) and it also comes down to revenge, which is usually enough incentive to find humor in the greatest of human disasters (especially, most so, when they go kind of really wrong). While you can read a lot into the satire of it all, that this figure or that or this institution does this or this other one is broken (marriage, the legal system, the bureaucracy, simply flipping someone off), it's almost best to look at this as a guy who is at a party and holding your undivided attention with a story that sounds too good to be true, but it is not, and then five times more. And as far as telling a damn good story, I'd be inclined to say the Wedding segment, which ends the film, is by itself the best film of 2014."
85,Wild Tales,8,25 December 2015,Pushing the boundaries of human behavior.,"This six stories into a film are clever, daring, and something wild.The point here is to put people in extreme situations in which revenge is often the triggering factor. Anyway there is more content. It also raise questions as the use of violence, exploitation between the citizen and the State, corruption on a personal level, emotional reactions and jealousy .... all this taken to the extreme and seasoned with black humor.It seems that everything is exaggerated with the aim of look at ourselves in the mirror. Eventually, humans may not be so different from what is portrayed in the movie.7,5/10"
86,Wild Tales,10,17 August 2015,Brilliant dark comedy,"The film is basically an anthology of 6 different stories involving revenge. You don't need to know anything other than that if even that when going to see this film. Throughout the film there's 6 very clever stories that unfold in a brilliant and darkly comical way. If your a fan of dark comedies then I highly recommend this one to you, I for one love dark comedies and I found myself laughing out loud at a couple times. One of my favorite parts was the beginning because it perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the film, I also like it because of how quick it sets itself up. If you don't get into the film within the first scene than I don't know if you will enjoy the film.It surprises me how low this has flown below the radar even as a Oscar nominee, if I hadn't seen this film at redbox I don't know when I would have watched it. If somehow you come across this review then I highly recommend you watch this film if it sounds interesting to you. If I had seen this in 2014 it probably would of been in my top 10. Very glad I got see this may even buy it. I hope you enjoy the movie thanks for reading my review."
87,Wild Tales,6,16 December 2015,Fun Argentinian anthology,"While I don't agree that WILD TALES is quite the masterpiece some reviewers on here are claiming, it is a fun anthology that definitely deserves a watch. Six outlandish stories are gathered together here, and each of them has a similar superior quality in terms of production values, cinematography, and acting. However, I would have preferred it had the tales been linked in some way (other than via general themes of revenge and people losing it) as in the excellent low budget American film 11:14.The first tale is set on a plane and is short and snappy. The twist is a cleverly achieved one and feels like one of those classic, pulp fiction-era short stories. It doesn't overstay its welcome, either. The second story, about a waitress seeking revenge, isn't quite as good - the whole 'showdown in a roadside diner' theme is very familiar - but things pick up for the third, an excellent and violent road rage story that's the highlight of the whole movie.The fourth tale is another good one about a guy who tires of having his car towed away all the time; the protagonist is somebody whom everyone can empathise with. The fifth tale is more complicated but works well, I think, and the twist ending is exceptionally hard-hitting. The last story of a cuckolded bride suffers from some way over the top acting on the part of the main actress but nonetheless proves a success thanks to some strong and shocking moments. I'd class WILD TALES as a fun, blackly comic anthology, definitely worth your time."
88,Wild Tales,10,26 January 2015,An extraordinary cinematographic experience,"From the very beginning to the end, Wild Tales is an extraordinary cinematographic experience. Can't remember of having such a good time in the movies before. Watching the people in the theater react to the different displayed situations with laughter, tension, and applause at the end was just worth buying the ticket.The carefully designed screenplay, the music score, the photography and the acting are all in perfect harmony, but the star of the film is undoubtedly the excellent use of dark humor. Couldn't get enough of it. Even the worst of the six stories would put into shame to many awarded shorts.Best movie of 2014. Would be one of the best all time if there were a connection between the different stories. Don't watch it alone!"
89,Wild Tales,10,7 March 2015,Comedies of Revenge to Rival the Tragedies,"Damián Szifron's movie WILD TALES opens with a prologue in which the laughs come at you like Roman slaves claiming to be Spartacus, one after another. It's the first, and shortest, of six revenge comedies in a mordant Argentinian anthology that keeps one guessing at the violence to come while making sure we always know, or think, that it will. The divergences of class and privilege, and official corruption, pervade the stories; so too, in the last names of the characters, does the great diversity of the country's European descendants, whether Spanish, Russian, Italian, or Jewish; so, also, do strong women and macho, crybaby men. Fully half of the tales deal with traffic, an Argentinian bugaboo, the injuries crying out for redress being a towed car, a hit-and-run homicide, and road rage. WILD TALES isn't just hilarious. It's cultural microcosm, psychological study, and social critique.Revenge Tragedy is a genre that imposes the duty of vengeance on a hero who, in order to halt the cycle, perishes in the act...

90,Wild Tales,4,13 March 2015,"Superficial, full of stereotypes and clichés.","We might ask ourselves what we pretend of cinema. If we look for simple minded ideas burden with commonplaces, compliance with common sense and compromise, then this is your movie. Rich or poor people, fathers, mothers, brides, society: all is what you expect to be, all subjects are treated on the surface with no discomfort for the viewer. All situations are made with an effectist purpose to amaze you in a childish way, like a trick from a chip magician. If you were looking for a dark humored exploration of the Argentinian society in all his violence, desperation and the grim reality lurking in everyday social and political developments, you will be disappointed. There are a few great actors like Darín, but they are wasted in all their potential. Even the few funny situations are lonely islands in a sea of nothingness. Argentina is funnier, darker, and far more tragic than this flick, fellows."
91,Wild Tales,5,5 May 2015,Good idea Bad film,"the movie's storyline is quiet good and seems interesting but as a matter of fact the details of the episodes are quiet a little raw like the restaurant episode which i myself didn't get the real intention of the old lady killing a man who she met some minutes ago for the first time,or the car crash episode is so raw too,how the police could not insure the security of a suspect and where the hell that man came from? there are loose threads all the time that doesn't make any sense in a movie which is not the director's first one.we can skip these loose threads if there will be some reason represented by director or it could have at least the primitive elements of a fantasy movie to make us believe these goofs but it doesn't.so at the end i must note that i think it was just a wanna be good movie and it's not even close."
92,Wild Tales,4,22 April 2015,Wild tales : A good collection of crazy stories by Argentine director Damián Szifron !!!!,"Any viewer can have issues with a portmanteau film as there is no guarantee that all viewers are going to appreciate all the short stories depicted in a film. Wild tales is a good example of a portmanteau film with six tales which are more than merely being wild. These are the tales which are about situations which might have something in common with a lot of other countries and cultures. For example : everyday situations like corruption, traffic jams and road rage can be understood much better in Asian societies than some European countries. This is something which does not reduce the intrinsic nature of 'Relatos Salvajes' being an indigenous Argentine film. This is a positive quality about a film which has the ability to remain local while making attempts to make its presence felt on a global level. Most of this film's tales are based on the relationships shared by opposites which one finds in all societies namely rich versus poor, honest versus dishonest and strong versus weak. What is remarkable is that at least three stories have been able to deliver strong messages based on one of these opposites. This is the reason why 'wild tales' has fifty percent chances of being liked by viewers as its remaining three tales are not so powerful to impress viewers. Lastly, it is for an individual viewer to decide which three tales suit his/her tastes and personality."
93,Wild Tales,9,2 February 2015,Two hours of good fun,"I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this movie. It was honestly two good hours of good pure fun.This movie is really about what happens when we let frustration pile up and everything becomes too much at some point. It's about when so much bad stuff happens to you, that you think the universe must have something against you: and then you decide to strike back. It's Murphy's law taken to the extreme and the struggle of the individual against it.What more can I say about this film: good actors, good acting, hilarious, totally unrealistic and grotesque (but that's the point!), and at the same time, it represents all those things that we've all dreamt of doing but never have had the guts for."
94,Wild Tales,10,24 December 2014,Loved it!,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I love to go to the cinema and I enjoy to see a good movie...and I can say with no doubt that is one of my favorites of all times. Even if I saw it a couple of months ago, I keep the plot of ALL the stories in my mind...it still subsist the emotion, the suspense, the fun I found in each and every story of the film while I was watching it. What amazed me the most is that it shows situations where we all could -in extreme- be involved in, if we loose control. You can feel identified -with fear and worry, of course- with the reactions of all characters described in the film (which are also terrible!). I have seen previous work of this director (Tiempo de Revenacha) and I found him very talented..."
95,Wild Tales,3,24 May 2015,Horrifying,"Among last year's nominees for the Best Foreign Language Oscar was ""Wild Tales"". However, in the US it really wasn't available in most cities until well after the awards were given. This is actually not unusual for this category of films, as often they initially have a limited release in California (thus making it eligible for the Oscar) and then are later released in the rest of the country. Fortunately for me (or perhaps not), I happened to be in Philadelphia for its recent release. After having seen the film, I had a hard time believing it would be nominated for anything--let alone an Oscar.The film begins with a scene that is terrifyingly similar to the recent tragic deliberate crash of a Malaysian Airlines plane. In this film, a disgruntled man arranges for all his enemies to receive free tickets for a dream vacations or a variety of other ruses. The people eventually realize they've been duped--but only after the plane is aloft. Then, it crashes into the ground--presumably killing everyone. This is how this Argentine comedy begins. I did hear a few nervous laughs throughout the theater--though even without the recent real air disaster, I don't understand how anyone could think this was funny.What follows are five more tales which all have the common theme of revenge. A few of them work (particularly the final segment--which is very funny) but many of them just seem very disturbing and gross. The audience is treated to seeing two characters vomit on camera as well as one defecating on camera....with a close up shot of the man's anus so you could see it was real! Additionally, several of the stories just seemed ugly, disturbing and, in a couple cases, would seem to endorse violence as a means to dealing with your problems. Considering it's supposed to be a comedy, I was just left shocked and horrified. And, perhaps, that is the intention of ""Wild Tales"". It IS shocking and presents as comedy things which aren't in the least funny or entertaining.While I thoroughly hated much of the film and worry that it might seem to excuse evil behaviors, I cannot completely condemn the movie for several reasons. Segment two and six were quite good and seemed far less nihilistic. Also, while I didn't like the tone of the other stories and found them disturbing, the production was extremely well crafted. The acting, direction and cinematography were as good as anything you'd see anywhere. But it all boils down to this....who wants to spend their night out and hard earned money to see something this unbelievably unpleasant and which might just be labeled 'revenge porn'?"
96,Wild Tales,,31 March 2015,"Wildly funny, but you may end up laughing at yourself!","You want to laugh at our rage against self-serving institutions? You want to chuckle at road rage gone scatological? How about the gigantic marriage ceremony gone bad? These three tales and three macabre more form the nucleus of a dark comedy from Damian Szifron unlike any you have ever seen.Wild Tales, produced by Pedro Almadovar, is a violent burlesque about our obsessions and our tempers lightened with our comically absurd attitudes toward societal imperatives and institutions over which we have little control. Although set in Argentina, the frustrations are universal.How many of us have seethed at seeing our cars have been hauled away for illegal (or not) parking. In a rare case when we are right, the bureaucracy will test us in the extreme to prove our innocence. As in a short story here, not all of us have the explosive resources to get back at the impersonal forces.Although Wild Tales (an appropriate title given the bizarre tales) makes light of the frustrations of modern living, the first episode depicting the strange coincidences of airline passengers' intersecting lives is so apropos for today's Lufthansa tragedy as to leave you breathless. You'll know my reference when you see the film.And see it you must if you haven't had some good laughs recently with so-called romantic comedies. Although one or two of the tales are not as mirthful as the others (the wealthy family involved in paying bribes is dull and long ), make no mistake, writer-director Szifron, will exact a measure of unease as you recognize your secret attitudes about gender and class in these six ""wild tales."""
97,Wild Tales,10,31 March 2015,After a lot of mediocrity ......... a great film !,"I've seen a lot of films lately, and at last a really brilliant film, 6 tales of original revenge! Dark, pretty violent and hilarious ...... what could be better ?The perfect night out ! The first story is uncanny re the recent GermanWings air crash as it shows the flight attendant being locked out of the flight deck, and as my friend said "" surely as this was made in 2014 it should have rung some bells,with the airlines just as a ""could happen "". I've just come back from Argentina, which I loved, so this was the crowning glory to everything Argentinian ! At the end of the film, the audience stood and clapped so it wasn't only me that loved it"

This film is a series of unrelated vignettes related only in tone and atmosphere. The tone can easily be described as dark as in each vignette the characters make the worst possible decisions. For example, getting your car towed followed by making idiotic choices can eventually derail your life. What other life scenarios will play out? Will you be able to imagine how far things will go? Often hard to watch at times from a cringe factor perspective, it will no doubt evoke the viewer's emotion. This had high production quality and good acting. Will you be able to hang in there?"

101,Wild Tales,10,18 November 2017,"""Can't you see that I love you?""","If you consider the word 'salvajes' in the Spanish language version of this title, ""Relatos Salvajes"", it closely resembles the word 'savage' in English, doesn't it? That's what came to my mind, as the six unconnected stories in this movie could just as well have been titled ""Savage Tales"". They are all positioned at some level for a savage outcome, and some of them are ironically hilarious in the execution, especially the wedding story between Romina and Ariel that closes things out.Another common element to be found in the offing is that familiar bugaboo about unintended consequences. The two tales of catastrophic road rage bear that theme out in cataclysmic fashion. The third story about the two drivers escalating into a violent confrontation ending in a fiery finale is so over the top that you wouldn't even consider the investigating sheriff's comment about a crime of passion. But it's there and lends a twisted component to the gruesome tale, one that will double you over with it's demented logic.The hit and run segment was another one of those unintended consequence stories that was visited in the end upon the hapless gardener who thought he was going to come out of it set for life. It's interesting to consider what might have happened to all the other parties involved after this story went black. All those scheming money grubbers were going to wind up with nothing in my interpretation, with their golden goose cooked. But I'm sure they would still try to squeeze Mauricio with his fat bank account. The unbridled greed in the story is enough to make you wince.And what can you say about the wedding story? The way it played out and the way it ended were so diametrically opposed to each other that you can only wind up shaking your head. But I guess that's what made it so viscerally entertaining. My summary quote is a line from the song that played out over the closing of that story, another fitting but ironic tribute to a masterful tale of love gone wrong and traveling full circle.This is the only film I've ever seen from the young Argentinian director Damian Szifron, but if his other output is even half as creative, he's got a huge future ahead. His credits page on IMDb points to primarily TV work, but if ""Wild Tales"" is any indication, we'll be seeing and hearing a lot more about him in the years to come."
102,Wild Tales,9,6 November 2017,Revenge and comedy rule this movie.,"""Wild Tales"" (Relatos Salvajes in the original) is by far, one of my favorite movies. The six combined stories that compose this amazing cinematic experience - ""Pasternak"" (Pasternak), ""The Rats"" (Las Ratas), ""The Strongest"" (El más Fuerte), ""Little Bomb"" (Bombita), ""The Proposal"" (La Propuesta) and ""Till Death Do Us Apart"" (Hasta que la Muerte nos separe) - , bring to life our deepest desires and craziest reactions when faced with typical everyday life situations. It also makes us wonder how the little acts and decisions can easily make things fall apart in a matter of seconds. Although all the short stories were written by the same person (Damián Szifron), they were directed and produced by different people, which gives this movie a particularity not commonly found in the movie industry. In my opinion, the greatest thing about this movie is that is a roller coaster of emotions. We are invited to immerse the stories and to live together with the characters what they are experiencing. And although, the stories have different themes - drama, comedy, etc. - the one thing that connect all of them, without exception, is the vendetta. The next parts may contain spoilers, so read it with care. The revenge is shown to us in many different ways. We see it as in an old and maturated remorse and hate towards others (as it is displayed in the Pasternak's story) and we can also find some of it in The Rats, but the feeling of punishing the man that was responsible for the protagonist death didn't come from the girl, but for her coworker in the restaurant.On the other stories (The Strongest, Little Bomb and Till Death Do Us Apart), we see it as a mad driven feeling, but the difference is that something happened at that moment. Is a fresh action that triggered that feeling. Actually, even in the 5th story, The Proposal we can see it in the last, very last scene. The soundtrack is also incredible and it is in the hands of Gustavo Santaolalla, an Argentinian producer, and songwriter. His work can also be seen in other pre-staged movies (""Babel"", ""Into The Wild"", ""The Brokeback Mountain"", ""The Motorcycle Diaries"") and also in the worldwide famous video game, ""The Last of Us"". To wrap it up, it's a full movie: you will cry from laughing, you will cry from sadness, you will feel shocked and also a little embarrassed. It's a movie that you can see with a relative, friends, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. I just don't think it is well suited for children (since it can be a little violent and also have some sexual scenes)."
103,Wild Tales,10,27 October 2017,Darkest comedy ever,"I found this movie coincidentally. 6 stories, one by one, I see humour that doesn't make me laugh, but merely put me in situation of how the jokes are happening for real. Jokes which slapping my face more than entertaining. But it has power of making me curious like hell to next story, keep going and going. Thank God, it is only 6 stories for the director to nail it, to play with me psychologically. Thumbs up as I recommend it to every one."
104,Wild Tales,8,9 September 2017,Evolution of humanity,"6 stories, 6 lifes, all connected by two things: society and rage.Marvelous stories represent clear evolution of society and we came to this point. Point that film shows.((Thousands of years ago we discovered fire, admired to the planet, helped each other.) Now, we care about us, our problems, our lifes and nothing else.)Scrict norms cause problems and conflicts which product is rage. And rage of one member of society, transmits to other member, though cohesion, causing deep social problems and awakes different deviations in behavior. Keeping this tempo of life (including governing), without looking aside will cause anarchy, and rule of rage, instead of law. The world as it is now, lifes of people, will more and more turn in these stories, if we don't change something in our perception of others and world."
105,Wild Tales,8,21 July 2017,Perfect human being movie.,"I really liked this film because the plot is based on the Argentinian routine. With a dark humor and sarcasm, typically Argentinian. The theme revenge is the main subject, that makes the movie interesting of course without the Hollywood imaginary fantasy. Outside the American circuit, Argentinian movies are a good option for no boring movies and they have excellent actors.I am a big fan of Ricardo Darín, and Argentinian movies and certainly, this movie was one of the best I saw, from Argentina."
106,Wild Tales,10,22 June 2017,Waauw.,"This is one hell of a ride. There are 6 completely different story's that are completely separate but still feel like one movie.It's basically all about things in live that can make a person angry, things we can all relate to. Like road rage, being under-appreciated, being cheated etc.It always starts with something like that, but the reactions of the people in these stories always take it on a path that gets you thinking: How is this going to end? The situations get so out of control that you think if they would just calm down and think about it, it wouldn't get out of control so much. But on the other hand you perfectly understand why they do what they do.And you just know you have made similar mistakes in the past, how unreasonable they may seem from a distance.I call this a master piece."
107,Wild Tales,8,28 April 2017,Wildly Entertaining Tales,"This film is, in fact, six short films sharing a central theme of revenge. They all involve people in extreme circumstances that lead to a highly entertaining series of events. If I had to pick, I would probably say that the final segment, ""Hasta que la muerte nos separe"", was my favourite. That would be followed by ""Bombita"" & ""El más fuerte"". Though the film is six unique stories, I felt they flowed well together. The film does a great job of mixing humour into these otherwise serious situations. Overall, I very much enjoyed this movie.8/10************SPOILER************Recommended to those that enjoy plane crashes, poisoning, road rage, sticking it to the man, rich privilege, rooftop revenge f**king, happy endings...?...but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Once"
108,Wild Tales,,21 February 2017,Savages,"'Relatos Salvajes' - or 'Wild Tales' as it is better known - this Argentinean film spins six stories showcasing how wild human beings can become when stressed and vengeful. Best described as a dark comedy, the events at hand often seem outrageous until one realises just how tense the characters are, and all the tales other than the fifth one deliver laughs in the face of tragedy and misfortune. The initial sequence with a 'Twilight Zone' air is by far the best chapter and yet it is sadly over before the end credits roll. The last two stories also run too long, exhausting their premises quickly. The scattered memorable bits and pieces of 'Wild Tales' are, however, endlessly powerful. As mentioned, the first tale is the best with a mysterious plane flight. A follow-up tale in which a waitress cannot decide whether to poison a gangster's food is equally intense and a third sequence with two deserted highway drivers has the biggest laughs. The fourth tale involves bureaucracy gone mad and features the most relatable protagonist. The fifth sequence involving a covered-up hit-and-run is the weakest, lacking the comedic air of the earlier segments, and while comedy comes back in full force for the sixth tale of a wedding gone awry, the chapter is a little on the long side. If hardly perfect, 'Wild Tales' is well worth watching. The quality of the tales vary, but they overlap magnificently well thematically, and per as the opening credits over wild animals, the film intelligently explores how we all have the capacity to release our inner animal instincts in the perfect storm of circumstances."
109,Wild Tales,10,11 December 2016,Relatos Salvages-Wild Tales a Master piece,"Wild Tales is the result of combining the best Argentinean director and cast. The film is portrait as a series of short tales that describe human nature in a crude, yet accurate and entertaining way. Each tale has its own set of actors with dramas and tales that disembody in the lost character's senses and control. Is a black humor, that may be difficult to understand for some foreigners. I haven't seen the version in English, but I'm guessing the translation is accurate, if by any chance you understand Spanish, I will highly recommend watching it in the original language. If you are not accustomed to Argentinean Spanish then it will be a good idea to use subtitles, because some verb's configuration are different."
110,Wild Tales,9,2 November 2016,You have to watch this movie,"There are very few movies which keep you pinned to the screen rite from the first scene. This is one of those movies. The stories (short ones though) are so engrossing, you just cannot let it go. Complete with the acting, and the filming this movie is a masterpiece. There are short stories of people and their behavior in situations of extreme anger. The first story is about a group of passengers who slowly discover that they all have one thing in common. The second is about a small time restaurant owner, who is serving a man who happens to be the person who wrecked her family. The third is about two car owners and a case of road rage. Fourth, is about an engineer who is going home for his daughters birthday but his car gets towed by the towing company for ""supposedly"" wrong parking. The last one (My favorite) is about a wedding where the bride discovers her husbands secret and decides to exact revenge, but again love prevails (I'm not posting any spoilers...watch the movie). Give it a shot guys...."
111,Wild Tales,8,18 October 2016,Argentinian Tarantino,"Argentinian ""Tarantino"" consisted of 6 stories was nominated for Oscar. Second and fifth story are bit below the level of the rest, but the rest is pure 10/10.My only objection to this masterpiece craziness is that they wasted 6 fantastic ideas on omnibus. Every single of those stories could have been developed further into individual movie, so we can have 6 masterpieces instead of just one. Stories are completely unrelated, so there was no need to make the six-pack out of them. Pity.Nonetheless, this movie blew my brains out. I give it 8,5/10 because for 10/10 all 6 stories should be perfect, but two aren't."
112,Wild Tales,9,15 July 2016,Just watch this film,"Excellent, almost in every aspect.. One of the best movies I have seen. I thought this would be enough, but for a review to be valid, 10 lines are needed, so ... Amazing different plots. Simple, every day life events that quickly escalate and erupt in violent but realistic manner for almost every story ending, except the first one which will take your breath away and leave you in a what if state of mind. Since my title is, simply watch this film, i will do little to spoil it for anyone who like me, hasn't watched it so far.Only one shooting, was below par in my opinion, and it's understandable really considering the budged Spanish films have compared to the ones from across the Atlantic, but, i repeat, watch this film.Keeps you on your toes from get go to the grand finale... Absolutely brilliant ..."
113,Wild Tales,7,10 June 2016,Good movie Argentine,"Wild Tales is a great Argentine film, the cast is full of Argentine movie stars , especially Ricardo Darin , the film has 6 history, what I liked most were the 2.3 and 6 , my favorite was the broken car , the film is funny and violent, the funniest story in my opinion was the 3 , more is also very strong , the picture of the film is good , the weather completely changes every story , some stories can even be pretty boring , has good dialogue , direction and good and agile, the director has good camera rolls , I did not like the story 4 , I found very weak, most have good performances , Wild Tales is one of the best Argentine films ever made ​​, the way the story is told it is very interesting , has excellent performances and a great direction. Note 7.8"
114,Wild Tales,8,14 May 2016,Mostly Great,"It's rare for an anthology type film to have more hits than misses, but this one pulled it off. That being said there is one that is clearly weaker than all the others, but as a whole this a very good film.The first two segments are the weakest in my opinion. The airplane one is kind of entertaining, but very short and doesn't have much of a payoff. The worst one in the film is the second segment in the restaurant. It has a good start but then has a very abrupt and kind of disappointing ending.The other 4 segments, however, are all great. My personal favourite was the road rage segment, closely followed by the wedding one. This gets a recommendation from me for sure. Overall: 3.9/5"
115,Wild Tales,9,13 May 2016,Argentinian Revenge,"""Wild Tales"" is a movie with episodic sequences from Argentinian cinema.Explains social and political issues in Argentina with 6 different story. Maybe at first glance it seems to be a local film, but after watching, you will notice that those issues can be in higher dimensions, because injustice and discrimination not belongs to any specific location of the world. This film is fighting with corrupt cycle system with violence tool for raising grace and also take a effective step toward for transfer main goal of the film to the audience. I really Enjoyed. don't hesitate to watch it."
116,Wild Tales,8,30 March 2016,Maybe the best picture of recent Argentinian new wave,"(I'm not perfect in English, so I'm sorry for some mistakes) What a singular movie! 6 tales, all different (no connection between characters or situations) and that only have in common the fact that shows how some people reacts to ""break"" situations - mostly with cars involved.Probably the best movie from recent Argentinian cinema (it's, in my opinion, even better then ""Nine Queens"" and ""The Secret in Their Eyes""), it should had won the Oscar for best foreign movie - because of the innovation, entertainment and cinematography quality of it.One of 2014's best and a must see!"
117,Wild Tales,9,16 February 2016,Off the wall and different,"Like it or not, you can't say that Wild Tales isn't at least something a little fresh in the lame movie industry.This is a Spanish film which should be seen with subtitles if you don't understand Spanish. It's just a couple of stories taken during a moment in time that are over the top situations of what could be real life encounters. I personally thought that the first was the best but that didn't detract from the remaining fun. There are some famous names in there that I recognized from Argentinian films I have seen before.There are six stories, each one about a specific situation that plays out. In the opening it is about a woman who is sent a plane ticket for a free flight. On it, a flirting older man discovers that he has something in common with the beautiful catwalk model. In another tale we meet a man in a Mercedes who gives a lousy driver a harsh rebuke while driving. How far does road rage extend? A young waitress in a restaurant discovers she is serving a man who, many years earlier, was the reason for her father to die and is an otherwise vile human being running for a political position. A demolitions professional finds himself besieged by the frustrations of a car towing company and the corrupt city that is mostly after the towing and parking ticket fees. And the grand finale is a wedding where past secrets make their way out into the open. There are a couple of good laughs throughout but it's mostly a dish best served cold. An enjoyable ride."
118,Wild Tales,9,15 February 2016,"'Wild Tales' is Deliriously Creative, Wickedly Hilarious, Deliciously Diabolical and Above All, Wild!","Damián Szifron's 'Wild Tales' is a deliriously creative, deliciously diabolical anthology film about modern day violence. It is an outrageous collection of shorts set in Szifron's homelanda sextet of improbable shaggy-dog stories, insane urban legends and entertainingly twisted cautionary yarns of the sort that people dispense during a night of heavy drinking, tied together by violent themes. Through six short parables, every facet of violence gets held up to the camera: its capacity for destruction, for vengeance, for justice, for renewal - in its most cathartic but glorious form.The film opens with one of the most daring ""eff-you's"" in years involving a group of plane passengers who make a terrible, terrible discovery after take-off. From there follows five more stories: a young waitress struggles to decide whether or not to put rat poison in the food of a loan shark who ruined her family's life; two motorists - a self-centered yuppie and a fed-up average - see how far road rage can push them in a game of deadly one-oneupmanship; a demolitions expert becomes a folk hero after fighting back against a corrupt transportation department; a rich father gets in over his head after he tries to bribe his grounds-keeper to take the blame for his drunk son's fatal hit-and-run accident; a wedding goes off the rails as a newlywed bride systematically humiliates and emotionally annihilates her groom after discovering that he cheated on her with a comely brunette and then invited her to the wedding reception - each story ups the ante in terms of rage.Szifron never attempts a grand statement about the nature of violence. He just lets each situation take itself to its logical, exaggerated conclusion. But something else lingers underneath all of this damn-near macabre madness. Most of the stories include a tug-of-war between social castes, with the upper and working classes duking it out over who can do the most dirt. But every time, the grim veneer of gallows humor shimmers through. While the stories themselves are about the joys of losing control, their creator knows exactly what can be achieved with crafty pacing, masterly editing and a precisely controlled balance between the matter-of-fact and the shamelessly hysterical. This is a master craftsman presenting a confident vision of revenge and primal anger that ranges from playful to disturbing. Szifron has a devilish good time crafting the shorts and exhibits a sophisticated eye, and a flair for creating morally ambiguous characters you don't know whether to root for. But that's Wild Tales for you - a wondrous, whacked-out look at volatile human beings doing what they think is right, when wronged.Wild Tales is a splendidly anarchic portrait of a world on the verge of a nervous breakdown - as sharp as a corkscrew and every bit as twisted. Like a vicious predator, it sinks its claws into your neck before you even see it coming - a provocative film that dares you to have a good time while it churns your guts."
119,Wild Tales,7,28 January 2016,"A truly ""wild"" experience","Sweet revenge, poetic justice and plain old sticking it to the man, who doesn't love such things? They're staples of cinema, from Once Upon a Time in the West, Oldboy through to what Damián Szifrón's multiple story filled saga Wild Tales could compare itself to most, Falling Down.In Joel Schumacher's well liked and remembered Michael Douglas starrer from 1993 where Douglas's William Foster had finally had enough and took his anger out on a city (and its poor fast food workers) audiences got to live viscerally through scenarios that our wildest imaginations have perhaps at times wandered off to and it's in this unlikely yet somehow relatable subconscious that Szifron makes Wild Tales work as some form of distant cousin to Schumacher's anti-establishment flick.Backed by famed director Pedro Almodovar, Szifron's Argentinian film (which was nominated for Best Foreign Film at last year's Academy Awards) is a well shot and highly dark collection of stories that all in some way, shape or form centre around revenge.As with all such films that feature a mishmash of stories, Szifron finds himself succeeding at some (a highway set piece and a hit and run cover up are highlights) whilst other scenarios like a diner scene or the films wedding finale feel a tad underwhelming but Wild Tales constantly engages the audience with its for lack of better word ""wild"" tone and lack of political correctness that would not be found in a Hollywood production of a similar ilk.Blood is spilled, explosions are ignited and rat poison is used in but a few of Wild Tales scenes and the film has an air of unpredictability about it that will often have you on tenterhooks even if the film could've lost 15  20 minutes in the editing suite thanks to a few segments that seem a little flabby around the edges, with drawn out situations and scenes, but there's little doubting the originality of much of what Wild Tales brings to the table.For fans of dark comedy not unlike early Coen Brother films or even a Tarantino creation, Wild Tales could just well become a new favourite and while some segments fall a little flat, Wild Tales is certainly one heck of a ride and the perfect antidote for those seeking a break from the usual Hollywood fair.3 ½ angry chefs out of 5"
120,Wild Tales,9,25 January 2016,Revenge is a dish best eaten with pastrami and vanilla frosting  Great episodic movie from Argentina!,"Aristotle says that comedy aims at portraying men as worse than they really are, so ""Wild Tales"" certainly qualifies on that score, though only two of its six episodes are really funny, IMHO (the one about the demolition expert, at least by the end, and ""Till Death Do Us Part,"" which is hysterical in all kinds of ways) This one reminded me of ""Amores Perros,"" with the welcome difference that the episodesall exploring the theme of vengeance and retributionget better as they go along. The first is like an old Rod Serling Twilight Zoner, assuming CBS standards and practices had been a lot looser back in the day. The next three are basically punchline driven: The road-rage duel is cleverly worked out, in a ghoulish black-comedy way; btw (alerto de spoiler!), the big guy starts to get all medieval after the guy with the Audi calls him a ""negro resentido,"" which, paradoxically, means something more like ""angry white man"" or ""redneck sorehead."" (PG-13 viewers should pay heed to numerous trigger warnings in the reviews on netflix.com!) The fifth episode, about a businessman's corrupt scheme to save his son from a hit-and-run charge, is very nicely plotted and has an ironic sting in its tail, like a Saki story. The standout is the last episode, in which fabulous Erica Rivas plays a modern-day Medea at an Argentine Jewish weddinggreat klezmer band! This one's a lot more emotionally involving than the others; if you've ever been in a shall we say volatile? relationship, you'll totally get it Great cinematography; great cast (glad that Ricardo Darín [""The Secret in Their Eyes""] has finally gotten a decent script)."
121,Wild Tales,7,18 January 2016,Insane to the power of six,"This is a suite of six short films. They are all hilariously surrealistic. In one film, the waitress in a smalltime restaurant contemplates spiking a politician's french-fries with rat poison, because she knows he is a masquerading gangster. In another, a demolition expert detonates a car park because he is angry with the city's extortionist parking system. Yet another film portrays macabre road rage on a spectacular road winding through the desert. And the final showpiece among the six is a black comedy triggered off by the bride discovering her soon to be husband's infidelity. Other than insane impulsive rage, there is no common theme bundling the six films together. They expose a flaw in the way our brains are wired and the dangerously thin line that seems to separate sanity from insanity. Many of us would recollect similar situations from our personal experience, when we managed to pull back from the brink. The characters in the film's six stories are not so successful and the consequence is destruction and death, which we relish vicariously. A hint of redemption is offered as a ray of hope in the last narration. This oddball of a film chokes us with laughter and therein lies our salvation."
122,Wild Tales,9,11 January 2016,A cornucopia of gleefully mean-spirited fun...,"Passengers on a plane discover they have more in common than they think. A waitress serves a man who troubled her family. A spat between two drivers escalates. An engineer is hounded by parking authorities. A young, rich man sits sobbing and drunk at the foot of his parent's bed. And a wedding starts to unravel.These are the 6 stories of Wild Tales. Innocuous at their outset, yet linked by the same cathartic spiral into madness. An exploration of 'the pleasure of losing control'; that is, the very human and fundamental passions that bubble beneath the reserved exteriors of the modern man and woman, here bursting forth in gleefully mean- spirited, exquisite release.​This marks my first foray into Argentinian cinema, and I am simply overwhelmed by how much I enjoyed this film. Each twist, turn, and act of beautiful passionate savagery was simply a pleasure to watch. This was only further enhanced by some truly wonderful cinematography and solid performances form the cast. The wit is sharp, the characters endearing in their madness, and the satire biting.For me though, the truest success of this film lies in that core sense of humanity. There is something so inherently sympathetic about each of these stories that one can't help but be drawn into the spiralling madness. The savagery that pervades the film lies not only in wrath and anger, but also love and passion, self- destruction, family and selfishness. ​ And of all the stories, the one I think that best encompasses this is 'Until Death Do Us Part': The Wedding that implodes upon itself. Somehow this tale manages to strike a thousand emotional notes and yet still be cohesive, compelling and tonally jarring in the most exquisitely deliberate way. On the day of their wedding a wife discovers her husband has cheated on her with one of the guests. What follows is an emotional carousel as the couple punish each other, themselves and their families; exploring the reaches of violence and lust and giddy seething fury. Yet somehow when the dust has settled, the fury exhausted and the wounds bandaged, this broken couple stand in the wreckage of their lives and find their love again as they throw themselves into an act of lustful, vulgar defiance to the world.The catharsis of these taut, charged moments resonate through the whole movie and culminate in an experience truly unique in it's delight for the inherent violence of life and man himself. I can't recommend it enough."
123,Wild Tales,10,6 January 2016,Go watch it,"To put it plain and simple, its a great film. Film is divided into 6 short stories, which are in no way connected, but all of them are dark and combine elements of humour and satire.1. ""Pasternak""- shortest off all stories, perfect to set mood for the rest of the film 2. ""The Rats""- interesting premise, ending kind of abrupt, but I didn't mind 3.""The Strongest""- reminded me of Spielbergs Duel, engaging and funny4.""Little Bomb""- perhaps the best of all stories, anyone who's ever had encounter with government bureaucracy (or bureaucracy of any kind) will be able to relate to this story (and this character played beautifully by Ricardo Darín),shows how absurdity of the ""system"" can drive you crazy because of something petty and stupid and how easy it is to become enemy of the ""system""5.""The Proposal""- some people complained about this story, I absolutely loved it and shows how easy it is to manipulate the truth when you have lots of money, ending is very dark 6.""Until Death Do Us Apart""- seemed bit over the top, but very funny and great ending to this great film As i said, go watch it"
124,Wild Tales,8,5 January 2016,six good stories,"These are six wild tales. (1) Various strangers board a plane and find they all know Gabriel Pasternak. (2) An arrogant man walks into a desolate diner. The waitress recognizes him as the loan shark who drove her father to commit suicide. The cook pushes her to put rat poison in the food. (3) A city guy in a nice car gets into an escalating fight with a brute in an old rundown car on a desert highway. (4) A demolition expert gets his car towed. He tries to fight the system which spiral out of control. (5) A young man is in a hit-and-run which kills a pregnant woman. His family hires the gardener to take the criminal charge in exchange for a large payout. (6) At her wedding party, Romina uncovers her groom Ariel had cheated on her. This sends her on a downward spiral.I rarely like all the vignettes in an anthology. Number 3 is my favorite. It goes down a rabbit hole and keeps going and going. It's relentless and fun. Number 5 is probably my least favorite. I would recommend Fargo season 2 TV show for a hit-and-run story. Number 1 is like a Twilight Zone episode. I'm not sure about Number 6 until the final scene. I love the way it ends and closes the movie in grand fashion."
125,Wild Tales,8,27 December 2015,"What goes around, comes around...","There is no better phrase to describe Damián Szifrón's disturbingly brilliant anthology. Six stories, each with the weight of rage and regret, each one is equally brilliant as the rest, makes Wild Tales one of the best movies ever made on the genre. The psychopathic cabin crew chief, the unintentional payback, the crime of passion, the commoner redemption, the unfortunate convict and the wedding of the equal minds. Stories that are so wild that will leave the viewers numb.Normally, anthology films tend to feature a wide spectrum of emotions, joining a common element. Some of them will be remarkable, while some won't be up to the standard. Wild Tales brings out six different lives interwoven with a common emotion - rage. It deals with how they handles with it, how it brings them down and how it provides them redemption. Written by the director himself, Wild Tales is rich with brilliant performances and beautiful visuals.Wild Tales leaves a scar burning with anxiety and sorrow, with a pinch of comic relief. Surpassing the limits of dark humor with it's story lines, this movie is a treat for the fans of Pulp Fiction and it's like. A well-deserved Academy award nomination, even though it didn't capitalize from it, Wild Tales has the potential to become a classic in the genre..."
126,Wild Tales,,21 November 2015,Wickedly Hilarious & Delightfully Deranged.,"Downright hilarious, incessantly fun & delightfully deranged, Wild Tales is one of the finest black comedies to surface on the silver screen in recent years and is a cleverly structured, ingeniously executed & expertly narrated anthology of six standalone shorts, each oozing with heavy dose of creativity, wickedness & macabre use of humour that, despite featuring different stories, forms a consistently thrilling whole and remains a highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly satisfying ride from the very beginning to the very end.Wild Tales (also known as Relatos Salvajes) is told in six segments. First follows a group of people on a plane who discover that they all have a common acquaintance. Second follows a waitress who recognises her client and the tragedy he caused in her life. Third concerns two drivers whose argument ends with tragic consequences. Fourth follows a demolition expert whose life is destroyed by a car towing incident. Fifth is about a wealthy family whose son has an overnight hit-n- run accident, and the sixth is centred around a wedding party in which the bride just finds out about her husband's infidelity.Written & directed by Damián Szifron, all the six stories within Wild Tales are connected by a common theme of violence & vengeance but the morbid wit of it makes sure that it never becomes too serious. All the tales are captivating & strong enough to stand on its own, all the characters are brilliantly penned down plus the actors do a terrific job in bringing them to life, Szifron's screenplay is as impressive as his quality direction, and each tale packs in highly believable scenarios, thus making it more effective. For me, every subsequent short was better than the one preceding it and the film as a whole never for once feels dull.The technical aspects make sure that all the stories exhibit the same feel & texture in order to maintain a consistent tone throughout its runtime. Cinematography binds it all the stories together with nearly similar camera-work & colour composition in all six stories, and all sets are brightly light. Its 122 minutes of runtime is steadily paced and every segment is tightly wrapped. A dark, sinister ambiance encapsulates the whole film at all times and the tense vibe is effectively sustained. Music plays a vital role in balancing the whole act and Gustavo Santaolalla's exquisite score does exactly that, in addition to some cool selection of songs.Coming to the performances, every cast member does a fantastic job in their given roles & the sum of the parts is always greater than any individual contribution. The leading actors in each segment carry that story amazingly well and even the ones chipping in with supporting work are no slouch. The acting ranges from thoroughly restrained to totally maniacal but all of their inputs are in tune with the narrative these characters are confined to. Ricardo Darín is one of the best highlights but the film saves its best for the last, where the duo playing a newly wed couple take the stage in a calm, fashioned manner but turn absolutely deranged to finish the film on a memorable high.On an overall scale, Wild Tales is a pleasant surprise for I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it turned out to be. It's a wild, crazy & demented experience that delivers the thrills in the most unexpected ways and is finely balanced & accomplished in both storytelling as well as technical aspects. It's smart, it's creative & it offers plenty of laughs plus every tale has got something that makes them stand out in one way or another. It doesn't happen very often in cinema when every short in an anthology movie leaves a positive impression and while the quality differs from story to story here, each segment well above the line of mediocrity. An instant classic, one of the best films of its year & definitely amongst the finest examples of its genre, this dark, uproarious & subversive satire from Argentina comes very highly recommended."
127,Wild Tales,9,12 November 2015,"Excellent assortment of edgy, original and enthralling short stories","Excellent assortment of edgy, original and enthralling short stories.Six short stories, all written and directed by Damián Szifrón. The stories are not connected at all and cover various subjects and characters. However, they are all incredibly interesting and engaging. Some have a great moral to them, some have great twists and some are just about a good, succinct story.It is actually quite amazing how much character depth and plot development Szifrón crams into each 15-20 minute story. The sharp, edgy plots and solid direction are aided by a cast that doesn't put a foot wrong.Goes to show you don't need 90+ minutes to tell a good tale. For the same time you can get six!"
128,Wild Tales,9,10 November 2015,Tales of Emotions,"Some movies you watch and just forget it, while some stay with you and haunt you (in a good way). Wild tales falling in the latter category deals with the dark side of human emotions.A modern tale of life and lives around us Six cleverly crafted shorts will make you laugh, scare and think. The movie also reflects the reaction of people in desperate situations,and the wild turn they can take. It also raises some serious questions regarding the society and relationship. What makes the movie really striking is the believable story-line with good casting and editing.To summarize, a cleverly executed movie that will stay with you for sometime..."
129,Wild Tales,8,31 October 2015,Wild for Sure!,"This is Outrageous! This is Dark! And this is Funny!Definitely an entertaining and wild ride. All six stories have twists and turns that take you to the unexpected. Well acted with good dialogue. The last one of the wedding is way over the top and crazy, but still excellent. The first story is short but sets the pattern. Essentially like all  and all different  with many different themes  revenge, gross corruption, impotence in front of the bureaucracy, infidelity, ... and then anger.If you want a roller coaster watch this! It's like sitting on the edge of the precipice as each story and its' characters unravel and reveal themselves. Each falls deeper and deeper into their predicament. It's a hoot."
130,Wild Tales,10,27 October 2015,Shockingly Original,"What a movie! I compared it to Tarentino's Pulp Fiction, and it made Tarentino seem less like a classic and more like a comic book. I compared it to Carnage by Polanski, and even though I'd thought of Carnage as stunning, Wild Tales was a lot more stunning.While the short opening story set the scene perfectly for the rest, it was far more than an appetizer. Instead, Wild Tales is more like a movie marathon, a six-course dinner.I loved the last tale best, even though it was one of the least violent. ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" Other reviewers disliked it because the woman's violent tornado of emotions was illogical or crazy. But I've never seen a tornado of emotion better rendered as plot in my life. What is raw and wounded on the inside becomes an open wound of a wedding ceremony. The only thing I can compare it to is a few stories of angry Goddesses from Greek or Roman mythology. The raw pain inside of her creates pictures that will remain with me forever.And that is why I love Wild Tales so much. I usually forget most movies fairly quickly. But not these stories. I want more from this director."
131,Wild Tales,8,26 September 2015,6 themes of revenge,"There are six themes of revenge in this movie coinciding with each story. I will briefly describe what the revenge themes are for each story.One is the unstoppable one, the perfectly executed revenge plan with scheming and hard work that truly takes dedication and conviction. This is the pent up hatred that never takes form, until it does all at once. The other is a dormant hatred that pops up from being dormant and has no place in the current world but nevertheless you are tempted to act upon it. Revenge sometimes takes forms where you want to do something slightly worse than what the other person did to you, but this sometimes creates a cycle of violence. Small things piling may escalate situations in a non-linear manner. And people who have little to lose will be seeking retribution in the flashiest of fashions, and perhaps without any real intent to harm someone but merely wish to express a manifestation of their emotions. Another is about misdirection, refusing to accept the societal consequences of an action and instead seeking to transform them into an economic ones. It is the choosing of who incurs the damage vengeance and the rewiring of justice. Finally the tit for tat story, where there is the concept of getting even for being wronged which if properly executed, will balance any initial asymmetries. At least 3 of these stories were spectacular to watch, with the wedding one being my favorite. Great movie, probably will be in my top 10 of the year."
132,Wild Tales,8,15 August 2015,under the wing of Almodovar,"'Relatos salvajes' (or 'Wild Tales' - the title under which the movie was distributed in the English-speaking space) was selected as one of the five candidates for the Best Foreign Language Film of the Year of the Academy in 2015. It did not win, but the very fact that it made it to the prestigious Final Five ensured broader success and world-wide distribution. Some may say that the film was conceived with an eye to the Oscars and festivals circuit, written in a manner that takes much from Almodovar, adds a touch of Tarantino and includes just the needed elements of local color and the gallery of fine actors to allow it to win almost all possible awards in Argentina. Almodovar actually co-produced the film, and his influence is hard to contest (I do not know how much he was involved in the making though). Yet, the wild tales brought to screen by director Damián Szifrón in this film have a quality of their own, a specific grin superposed upon the human approach and the social engagement that characterizes the best South-American films, whatever genre they belong to.'Wild Tales' is a collection of stories, and if I need to define what is common among them is the fact that in all of them more or less ordinary people face day-to-day challenges that they are unable to deal with and as a result they turn into escalating spirals of conflict and violence, all managed with a good dose of black humor. The script and the director are merciless with their heroes and the stories do not end until the characters are brought to or beyond the verge of insanity. For none of them (those who survive) life will not be at the end the same as at the beginning. As viewers we can easily identify with the driver harassed by a hooligan with a truck on a deserted road, with the engineer who is late at his daughter's birthday because of an unjust parking ticket, or with the bride who discovers at the wedding party that her fresh husband not only cheated on her, but also invited 'that woman' at the wedding. We can understand why they go crazy and why they end by doing the most unreasonable acts. Most important at all ,we can laugh about these.The humor, the empathetic view and the social touch are the arguments that make out of the Argentinian director's collection of stories much more that a pastiche of Almodovar's movies. Acting is very good and each one of the characters adds its own piece to a puzzle of contemporary Argentina, a country that I know too little about. 'Wild Tales' are entertaining and worth to look for, and director Damián Szifrón is a name to follow."
133,Wild Tales,9,30 July 2015,Excellent,"Split into 6 short (~20 minute) stories, perhaps challenging the common notion of a movie in a dense modern style of short and fast, spans all that cinema has to offer really (hence classified as a comedy, drama and a thriller at the same time): those who look for easy entertainment will find a roller coaster of emotions, which can also be interpreted as grotesque humor. Those who want to dig a bit deeper might find a much finer line of humor tinged with sometimes bitter auto-criticism of the individual and the society (Pasternak, The Strongest, Rats, The Proposal), but above all - (deep buried) optimism and celebration and joy of living (Bombita, Wedding). For those who wish to take the most of this movie I'd suggest coming in a good condition to concentrate, and setting aside a couple of hours after the movie to reflect and discuss."
134,Wild Tales,9,27 July 2015,Tales from the crypt lives again,"The very dark humour, the irony, the chaos, even the length of the stories. Everything point to one thing: Tales from the crypt. The only difference is that here, we don't have any supernatural. Also, in Tales FTC, usually someone or everyone has to die. Its a rule of somewhat. Here, its not necessary. Sometimes people die, other times they don't. Completely unpredictable. My favourite stories are the first one(most creative one) and the last one(at a wedding we all want everything to go perfectly. What happens when nothing does?). Some stories are on the level of a mediocre TFTC episode, but most are very good. I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes dark humour. Good job senior! We want more!"
135,Wild Tales,10,24 July 2015,Passion--Pro and Con,"A wonderfully entertaining movie! Six tales about the way passion can provide immense satisfaction while also involving one in the most trouble imaginable. Be sure to watch for the stoic advice toward the end of the movie--a masterful touch! The acting is excellent, as is the cinematography. Most delicious of all, however, is the laughable irony that underlies all of the tales. From beginning to end, some of the characters think reason will save the day, but it never does. Instead, even in the cases in which the consequences are as severe as can possibly be imagined, violent and uncontrolled passion has its rewards. Rarely does one see such a defense of emotions at the expense of reason, but ""Wild Tales"" makes us feel, and perhaps even reasonably conclude, that passion, whatever its dangers, is a vital part of human existence."
136,Wild Tales,10,23 July 2015,"Finally, something worth watching !!!","Amazing, a movie with almost all of it's minutes perfectly aligned to comprise a movie watching experience after which you won't ask for your time back, rather you'll feel it has been a time well spent. Time will fly and eyes will grow, jaw will drop, and tears will flow. This movie has achieved for me something only a true Greek drama can. It has borough catharsis back to the cinema, but in a really funny and a really clever way, and with the benefit of repeating it 6 times over. Why is there no more movies like this ??? I presume, because it's such a f... hard thing to do. Watch this movie. You will regret it only if it's your 13'th time. Maybe not even then :)"
137,Wild Tales,8,20 July 2015,"Great movie! - Entertaining, original and funny!","This movie is a collection of 6 short stories, which all has the theme: revenge in common. The stories doesn't cross each other, and could be seen out of context. they all have interesting stories, dark humor, action and good acting. they are funny in an absurd way, and will definitely keep you entertained.The only story i didn't like that much was the one with the car accident, where they had to blame the Mexican. Didn't really think the store reach its' potential, but still i was entertained, and once you have finished the movie you will left back pretty amused. even though I didn't like all the stories, i still found the whole movie pretty good."
138,Wild Tales,10,19 July 2015,animals of the human world,"Damián Szifron's ""Relatos salvajes"" (""Wild Tales"" in English) features a couple of stories focusing on people who want revenge and use violence to achieve their ends. The best vignette is the one starring Ricardo Darín as a man intent on not paying his parking tickets.I previously saw Darín in the Oscar-winning ""Secrets in Their Eyes"", set on the verge of Argentina's Dirty War. That one and this one suggest to me that Argentina has a vibrant film industry, and I would like very much to see more movies from there, a pronounced advancement from the Dirty War (the Kirchner and Fernandez presidencies probably helped). The hilarious satire that is ""Wild Tales"" deserves every award that it's won. I highly recommend it."
139,Wild Tales,9,15 July 2015,Six really great short films packaged together with the common theme of revenge!,"This film is from Argentina and was nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. I am usually not a huge fan of Foreign Films, but this one is actually really good. The movie is essentially six short films played back to back, all with the common themes of revenge and distress. The fact that the stories are only connected by their theme would normally have annoyed me, but the stories are extremely good. After each story the viewer is not only enthralled by the climax, but is eager in anticipation for the next one. You find yourself asking how can the next one possibly top the previous, but it always does. The stories get longer and more detailed as they go along, which allows the viewer to get much more involved with much increased character development coming in the later ones. The first story starts in an airport and a seemingly normal day. We see some people going about a normal trip through an airport. It is only once they on the plane and two passengers begin a pleasant conversation that the passengers realize that the plane they are on is anything, but a routine flight.The second story takes place in a normal cheap looking restaurant. A terrible man from one of the waitress's past, walk in and sits down to eat. The waitress struggles with what do to, while the much older cook has some pretty clear ideas. The first two stories are very short, so there is not a lot more I can say about them without giving the whole thing away though. They don't need to be longer though because they are very poignant and really interesting. The first one is the absolute perfect way to set up for the rest of the film. I didn't care, as much for the second one though, it was definitely my least favorite of the six.I'm going to sound a little uncreative here, but the best way to describe the third tale is wild. It starts off with a man driving down a road, when he encounters something everyone encounters pretty much everyday: a driver in front of him or her who is driving slower. After much effort the man eventually gets around him and leaves him with a nasty insult (something probably everyone has done at some point). The story really makes you questions the parting insult, because we all do it with the rational of ""oh it doesn't matter because I'll never see him again."" In this story though the driver does see the man again, and it turns out he took the insult pretty hard. The two men essentially lose their minds as the return blow after blow to each other each one so much worse then the one before. This story was so enthralling for me because it starts off with such a normal situation and escalates out of control so quickly.The fourth story was my favorite one in the whole film. It starts with a man, who is clearly having a bad day already, when his car gets wrongfully towed while he is picking up the cake for his son's birthday. He has to go pick it up and ends up missing the whole party. Our man, Simon, is very against society as a whole and demands retribution for his ordeal. Unfortunately he doesn't receive that at all. The towing company refuses to repay him, which leads to an anger filled tirade at the Argentinian equivalent of the DMV (basically what everyone wants to do, but doesn't actually do it). The tirade ends up getting put on the news and his wife decides to leave him because of it and his job fires him. A little while later while trying to start a new life for himself his car is wrongfully towed again. Simon decides its time to do something about it. All I will say is that his previous job was as a demolition expert. This story is just plain cool, you root for Simon the whole time, and probably wish you had the courage to yell and throw trashcans at the DMV.The fifth story begins with a news report saying that there had been a hit and run of a pregnant woman. We shortly find out it was a drunken teenager, from an extremely wealthy family. The parents have no idea what to do, until the father decides that he can pay the gardener to tell the police it was he driving. It leads to a whole lot of issues. This story is a lot darker than the others, and you don't really care for any of the character, but it is still very entertaining.The final story is the longest one and definitely the most messed up. We see a very happy wedding going on. The bride and groom are happy, but then the bride notices something weird, her husband is talking to a really attractive guest. Through a little investigating she realizes that her new husband had cheated on her. She absolutely loses her mind. The rest of the story is just nonstop craziness, but you can't look away because it is so good.These stories are so good and so original. I truly have never anything like any of them. The stories do flow pretty well together because of their common themes. Even if you don't watch all the stories, if you completely miss out you will regret it.9/10"
140,Wild Tales,8,8 July 2015,Wild and crazy roller coaster ride,"The movie consists of six different pieces, each with its own strong and unique story. One common thing in all the stories is that they'll blow your mind away. I really like how the script of each story plays on the flow and duration as to avoid the viewer's anticipation rate ruining the build-up. The first story is quite quick though it builds up slowly and then rapidly escalated into suspense. The second and third stories followed almost the same formula although the duration gets longer each time the movie changes its story. But the last three stories are made to use more duration and are more intricate than the earlier ones. Yet they still possess the same unpredictability level, which is very nice. The story gets predictable only at the very last moment, and even that kind of predictability can only be seen by experienced movie goers. And yet the movie closes itself with a totally different ending for its last story. The acting overall is a great job, but moreover the directing job is of a high level of mastery."
141,Wild Tales,6,2 April 2015,When does a film's self-fulfilling prophecy become a crime . . .,". . . on the part of the filmmakers, and what should the penalty be? It's clear that the German airline co-pilot who crashed his Airbus into the Alps on purpose this week probably saw WILD TALES first. It may well have been on a date the night he knocked up his friend with the job formerly called ""Stewardess."" You might say, ""So what, let people watch whatever flicks they feel like seeing."" But I say, now that we know that major airlines bend over backward to keep medicated psychotics in their cockpits, the world's movie-makers must not put graphic depictions of airliner suicide missions into these suggestible cabin crew members' heads. As I've written here before, Quantum Physics and String Theory tell us that ANY story shown on the Big Screen has an 83% chance of happening in Real Life later--usually within 12 months of international release. If nobody ever left the movie theater AFTER watching flicks such as WILD TALES, worrying about what's up there on the screen would be a moot point. But most people DO leave, and too many--such as the German suicide pilot--become Hell-bent upon integrating what they see in the multiplex into Real Life. WILD TALES is mildly diverting, but I'm glad not to be one of the first 149 innocent bystanders to die for it!"
142,Wild Tales,8,4 March 2015,Lives up to high expectations.,"The person going the most wild in Wild Tales is writer/director Damian Szifron. His vision is no holds barred as he explores six individual stories of rage going too far. They're surreal, heightened and mean-spirited, but they have a delicious dark sense of humour that speaks true to the ugly side of the human condition. Granted, the first couple are quite simplistic, but each story gets better and better as it goes along, growing in scale. All its brilliant contrivances are amusingly poetic, smirking with great dramatic ironies. But the stories aren't thought- provoking by living in isolation. They're deep rooted in class conflict and other oppressive factors of society. It speaks to a restless Argentina and Szifron's Wild Tales is incredible at bringing it to life. It does have a couple of clunky moments where his ambition is beyond his execution, but this all hints to his potential, and Wild Tales is a damn fine passion project for his resume already. 8/10"
143,Wild Tales,1,15 January 2016,Bitter and corrupt,"is everyone in this movie. And violent. For the sake of it.I am not one to be squeamish about blood, or violence, even if it is not justified or is a little bit for the sake of it, as here. Sadly, the problem with the movie is not even that it glorifies it all (it would be horrible to live in a society so violent and hypocritical as the one depicted in the movie... oh...).The problems with ""Relatos salvajes"" are two. One, it is not original. It has been done hundred times. And better. The violence, the short stories, people breaking under stress, the sarcastic, cynical, tongue-in-cheek tone, the last ""twist"". The random sex. And two, and one that could be forgivable if it was original, it thinks too high of itself, it thinks that is way smarter than it really is.For some people, this movie could be a surprise, and that is great. But every punchline, surprise, or development is obvious, not surprising and boring."
144,Wild Tales,8,12 April 2015,The movie structure,"I think this movie structure of several short unrelated stories will become bigger with time for is an all gain scenario. The viewer is happy for he gets what he needs: to be entertained. Nobody here is loyal to the unity of one script, one story, one beginning, one end. I want to be excited and I don't care if the reason is 10 short stories put together. Many one script, one story, one script writer films lack of action and the story sometimes falls into dead pauses where long monotone dialogs take place while you suffer waiting for the next punch of the movie to put you high. In short stories you go straight to the point, for there is no time and length for this your short story to be told, so everything must flow quick, every detail is a must be told.On the side of producers and directors, you are not presenting your work in the section of short films on the one hand, and if your movie is composed of 5 short stories, is like if you were presenting your film 5 times as candidate for the short movies category prize. So you really augment your chances of winning. It is as if you were able to put in 1.5 hrs time, Apocalypse now, Full metal jacket and Platoon in one film, pretty sure you would win all prizes that year."
145,Wild Tales,8,10 April 2015,It is not only wild but it makes you feel wild too,"The director takes you where he wants to. Somewhere between third story your mindset is completely transformed and you are approvingly awaiting something explosive, violent to happen. It awakens something wild in the viewer and it doesn't try to morally justify the violence portrayed. It just makes you connect with something primitive and approving of the character's behaviors. I loved the music, in the very first story It helps to accomplish a thrilling, exciting beginning. You'll find it hard to choose your favorite one but i bet the third one will be the winner most of the times. It is just amazingly savage, crude and somehow funny.The film really flies by but it doesn't leave an unsatisfying feeling which happens often after watching compilations of short films.pd: excuse my English"
146,Wild Tales,8,1 April 2015,Shocking and entertaining tales of revenge,"I liked this film, it's a stylish collection of revenge stories. Each piece is brilliantly conceived, personally I found some of the stories predictable but knowing how they would end by no means spoiled my enjoyment of them.The road rage story was probably my favorite and I couldn't believe my eyes as it developed.A word of warning, Wild Tales is a dark film and some of the scenes aren't for those of a sensitive disposition. The mischievous thread of humor running throughout the movie does make its disturbing moments more palatable.If you like dark and funny films, if you're after something raw and more adventurous than the usual mainstream offerings I recommend you see this excellent film as soon as possible."
147,Wild Tales,6,7 March 2016,Five Tales Ranging from Very Good to Very Bad,"The five separate tales here are so uneven that it is unbelievable they all came from the same director, unless he has split personalities ranging from 'inspired' to 'grade-B wannabe'.Without revealing the plot here are the five:1) 'Flight' thingy - a little over-contrived but still an interesting and suitable short intro to the suite2) 'Road Rage' thingy - the best of the lot. In the modern world, nothing brings out the raw brutality of ordinary people more than road rage incidents, and this piece is such an excellent brutal elegy to this very human condition - tightly choreographed, extreme yet highly believable - a worthy display of black comedy realism.3) 'Explosive expert exploding' thingy - another gem on the exposition of modern day rage gone awry. Again well-scripted, well-acted and highly believable - how daily encounters with official incompetence and boorishness can build and trigger explosive reactions that jeopardizes more than its worth, yet someone who is otherwise ordinarily sane, would mindlessly pursue it to its end without regard of the damage it wrecks on oneself and the innocent.4) 'Switch driver' thingy - this one is a big big let down. Totally unbelievable, poorly conceived and badly scripted. Definitely in cheap B grade territory.5) 'Wedding couple extremes' thingy - worse even than the previous: just plain bad bad bad. Wedding guests just standing around like zombies while the couple 'act it out' - just bad directing and bad acting, and stretching out in duration way way way past its welcome. Cheap grade B attempt, trying to be clever but just ending up everyone's fool.If the director had just stuck with the first three, it may have just about won the Oscar - 2014's winner ""Ida"" was more an exercise in black-and-white style rather than substance.What a waste as the 4th and 5th could have worked if simply better thought through and in the able hands of whichever person (or personality) that scripted the 2nd and 3rd.Coud have been a classic suite - well, que sera sera!"
148,Wild Tales,,26 February 2015,Crazy and wild,"Well, that certainly was... something. I had no idea it was going to be as erratic, as crazy as it was. I've seen people describe it as a crowd-pleaser, but I actually don't see it like that all the way. Some of the stories are so out there in their format and structure that I see a great majority of people just being bewildered and annoyed at it. Regardless, it's a thoroughly entertaining ride, at times more than others. I don't see it holding up well on a rewatch at all. It has the benefit of being one of the most unpredictable films I've seen in years, but it also comes together as very disjointed. None of the stories are bad, but the lesser ones aren't memorable enough to stand out, and the best ones are also just very messy. I don't know, I'm up for something crazy, but I didn't find much of anything here to be anything other than superficially interesting and entertaining, certainly nothing that held much depth in terms of how I saw it. That's another thing, it's sort of overwhelming. By the time it was over I felt like my head could explode. The cinematography was also quite distracting at times. That sounds like a very negative opinion, but no, I liked it. it works on a scene-to-scene basis incredibly well, and surely it takes talent to create such wild, uproaring stories like this where there's no actual structure that needs to be followed. Erica Rivas is also all kinds of amazing in this in her short screen time. She makes a huge impact. So yeah. I liked it, but I only finished watching it about an hour ago and I already like it less than while I was watching it. Certainly glad it didn't beat Ida."
149,Wild Tales,,26 December 2015,Awesome tales of intrigue and irony,"*Spoilers*(1) Aeroplane - Simply put, dark comedy at its best. The ending had me splits. This is one of the best short films I have ever seen. (2) The Road - Two sides of same coin? The road rage episode is dark, violent, and crude in a good way. It is sad and funny at the same time to see two stubborn people who go at it against each other because of their bloated egos. They are basically two sides of the same coin.(3) The Restaurant - Revenge is the dish best served cold. Suspenseful and well directed but too short. The end is bland.(4) The Bombita - Totally epic. Loved it with great aha! The only doubt I have if the ending was surreal or real?(5) Hit and Run - My favorite of the movie. (6) The Wedding - Funny but the entire thing doesn't lead to anything really."
150,Wild Tales,10,16 June 2015,"'Relatos Salvages'(WILD tales,2014)by almodovar & damien szifron","I caught this movie late in the game when I should have seen it when it came out in January(?),so I probably don't have a lot to add to the user reviews,but I gleaned from same that the episode( 6 shorts about 20 min.long), the one about the 2nd degree vehicular manslaughter case),the rich father of the car felony hit & run son bribes a peasant gardener to take the fall,& when he leaves the house during their negotiations for money,the rampant mob kills him in rage. This reminded me of that Italian movie,HUMAN CAPITOL, also about a 2nd degree vehicular manslaughter hit-and-run case. I like the way Almodovar places a 'throw-away' episode first( only about 6-8 minutes long?),which shows a woman passenger about to embark on a routine flight(south America?)from Spain(Barcelona?),& soon engages in conversation w/ the other passengers, only to find out that they are all talking about a loser they once encountered,Gabriel Pasternak,who, shockingly is actually on board as well!The estranged male stewardess locks himself in the cockpit(overpowers the crew?) & proceeds to 'throw away' the entire 150 passengers on board,as the plane falls to its doom in a Argentinian suburb(?).THe episode closes w/ the shocking sight of a plane crashing into a elderly couple's backyard swimming pool,& then the film credits begin,WILD TALES...( this short episode recaps,or should I say prophesizes the later horrible GermanWings flight 9525, where Pasternak is replaced by the real life co-pilot,Andre Lubitz who threw away 150 passengers by flying plane into side of a mountain. I heard that movie theatres had to put a disclaimer when showing this grim reminder.I guess the title,WILD TALES, didn't seem to draw me in last January,as I guess it was about some kind of anthology about some kind of wild, college fraternity partying movie(?). I suggest a better title,if Almodovar wishes to make a sequel,WILD TALES 2,but call it instead,'THE HUNTING HYPOTHESIS'!This is the name of a book,by dramatist,RObert Ardrey,which I tried reading several yrs.ago,& claimed to my friends that I understood it.I think people who have a background in zoology,biology,or just plain amateur scientists would better appreciate this book.(But you need no science background to enjoy WILD TALES,6 tales of 'Lord of the Flies' bonding,aggression,dominance,leadership,& social 'play'(murder sounds more like it!)ending in a humorous punch line,or humorous moral(?)..... ADDENDUUM--I watched this film just days after 'ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL',& although the prior film was emotionally touching,it took me out of my comfort zone & left me very depressed to see that beautiful girl die at the end of film. I agree that WT is not emotionally touching,nor a triumph of intellectual revelation,but it also took me out of my comfort zone for an entirely different reason,the violence is subservient to the plot structure,if you can even find a 'plot structure',(one word to describe plot structure:REVENGE!)..I left the theatre not in a depressive funk,but strangely liberated & almost giddy after seeing a film that would probably make Hollywood mega-million blockbusters(MAD MAX:FURY ROAD) look like a girl scout bus excursion to the countryside!There is a scene in the last 5 minutes of 'Me and Earl', where the protagonist writes,'The last person who reads this post fell into a coma & died 10 days later.' I wouldn't be surprised if some movie theatre owner posted a disclaimer:'the last person who viewed WT fell into a coma & died 10 days later.' Such a fun-filled,demented,'BeetleJuice', incredibly well acted film,can't give enough praise to the director!THe difference between science & the literary form(books,plays,movies) is that science is not stimulating to the imagination enough to make movies because the products of scientific stimulus do not make it to film because scientists as a class are devoid of any ability to adapt it to screen writing.If Robert Ardrey were alive today,& hired as a consultant to ALmodovar,first-class dramatists like Ardrey can share their enthusiasm,literary screen writing skills & translate boring scientific concepts into personal visions like WILD TALES,with an artistry beyond the typical scientists' REACH?"
151,Wild Tales,10,11 April 2015,"highly entertaining, surprising, exciting","I loved ""Wild Tales""!!! Each one of the 6 tales pulls you in, not a second wasted. Creative and shocking scenarios told with plenty of dark humor. I had the feeling Almodovar must have inspired this wonderful filmmaker, who has a unique style of his own. Very realistic storytelling, you feel you're in the middle of the action, due to some wonderful camera work and direction as well. The stories are all different, with the common theme of revenge. There was one story I couldn't control guffawing and I rarely laugh out loud in a movie theatre. Everything comes together here: Wonderful storytelling, direction, acting and camera work. BRAVO! Run and see it!"
152,Wild Tales,7,31 December 2016,Time Wounds All Heels.,"This is in Spanish and is episodic. I hope no one is put off by that because these half dozen tales of mayhem are hilarious. Even as the tragedies deepen they tickle.Every story involves mere middle-class Argentine citizens engaged in the usual stuffs of ordinary life -- giving the finger to the slow driver in front of you, paying a parking ticket, keeping your kid out of trouble, trying and failing to bring a lavish Jewish wedding to a decorous close with as little blood spilled as possible.I won't describe any of the stories but I'll mention the close of the one dealing with the incremental increases in road rage. Two drivers have killed each other in a wreck at the side of the road, unwitnessed. When the recovery vehicles arrive, a coroner stares at the two charred skeletons inside one of the hulks. They're hugging each other now. He muses, ""A crime of passion?"" The acting and direction are unimpeachable. The portrait of the bureaucracy and its multiple dead ends is unimaginably precise. If Kafka had been given to violent endings --"
153,Wild Tales,10,18 December 2016,Awesome black comedy/thriller,"Wild Tales is a 2014 Argentine black comedy anthology film composed of six standalone shorts, all written and directed by Damián Szifron, united by a common theme of violence and vengeance.It stars an ensemble cast consisting of Ricardo Darín, Oscar Martínez, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Érica Rivas, Rita Cortese, Julieta Zylberberg, and Darío Grandinetti, and was co-produced by Agustín Almodóvar and Pedro Almodóvar. The film's musical score was composed by Gustavo Santaolalla. It was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, won the Best Film Not in the English Language at the 69th British Academy Film Awards, and also won the Best Ibero-American Film at the 2nd Platino Awards.The film is composed of six short segments: ""Pasternak"", ""Las Ratas"" (""The Rats""), ""El más fuerte"" (""The Strongest""), ""Bombita"" (""Little Bomb""), ""La Propuesta"" (""The Proposal""), and ""Hasta que la muerte nos separe"" (""Till Death Do Us Part""). In the American localisation, the third and the fifth had their names changed to ""Road to Hell"" and ""The Bill""."
154,Wild Tales,7,3 April 2016,Fashionable anti-affirmation wrapped up in an old package,"It's been a while since I've seen a compilation movie, but the format lends itself well to these type of short cameos where the theme is similar, but perhaps not substantive enough for a longer work. Personally, I thought the first tale was the strongest, but by the third I was hoping for a change of tack. As I'd not heard of the film before, I stayed till the end, but I'll be pleased when the current fashion for nihilism dies a death and we can move on. When revenge and misery can be celebrated as enthusiastically as this film's popularity would seem to indicate, it doesn't bode well for society as a whole. The movie is well put together, well-acted and the scripts are good, but nobody is going to look back on this film in twenty years time as anything other than an occasionally humorous piece of light-entertainment."
