0,Cars 3,1,15 August 2017,Pixar 1995-2017 ?,"The Good:The graphics looked absolutely amazing. Best animation visuals I've ever seen. That's about it...The Bad:The trailer for the movie was *completely* misleading.Doc hudson died without any explanation. Cars that trained him ( older ) are still alive which makes you think something unexpected must of happened? I'm guessing this is because of the voice actor passing away, but some kind of explanation would of been nice.A lot of bad messages for kids. Aging is something to be made fun of ( excessively in the movie ). Once you're older there's no way you can possibly win. If you're not winning at something, give up and circumvent the rules so you can basically cheat to win ( because that's all that matters ). If someone says you can't do something ( Cruz not able to be a racer ) stop trying completely and wait until you're grown and someone comes along and fixes the situation for you.The interactions between 'Mater and Lighting were the highlight of Cars 1. Funny jokes, fun times, laughing and friends. Mater and most of Radiator Springs were left out of this one. The movie was very serious and the jokes that were said were untasteful ( mostly about his age ). I'm not sure I even laughed once during the movie.The level of propaganda was impossible to look past. Cars 2, and especially Cars 1 cultivated a following of mostly young boys that are into cars/racing/trucks etc. They wait until Cars 3 to turn the entire franchise into a story about equal opportunity and equality. The main reporter in the movie is suddenly female, the famous demolition derby star is female, and the new hero/racer of the Cars franchise is female. She has no experience as a racer, drives on the beach once ( never practices once on asphalt ) and then goes to win the race with Jackson Storm who has set all kinds of new records? After she wins the race the camera cuts to every one of the female characters going ""whooo"". I don't understand why a kids movie has to push politics and ideology. IT'S A KIDS MOVIE. Also, I can't see my 4 nieces hanging up their Frozen outfits to get some Cruz toys.All in all it left a really bad taste in my mouth not only about Cars but Pixar/Disney as a whole. Are there going to be any more innocent kids movies with humor for the adults as well, or just neutered stories for the sake of PC."
1,Cars 3,1,22 June 2017,Please don't watch the movie if you liked cars 1,In which movie does the main protagonist chickens out before the final showdown (boss fight or the race in this case) and says to his trainer that you have been training with me so you can go and win it for me.The whole point of the movie is that Mcqueen gets to decide when he should retire and so he trains hard to beat the rookie and just before the final race he turns to his trainer asks her to race in his place.F**kers i went to watch the movie expecting that it will be about a comeback story of Mcqueen and not how he is forced to retire.
2,Cars 3,1,27 June 2017,How awful this was,"When Cars the original came out I was seven years old I followed the ""trilogy"" to where I am now 18 and let me tell you something... this was not how I wanted lightning to end his career I mean Jesus was this movie awful. I would rather have watched the big bang theory on repeat for the rest of my life."
3,Cars 3,1,16 June 2017,Disappointed,"There are so many disappointments with this film, I don't know where to begin. So I'll start herefirst, the tag-line that, ""you can't turn back time, but you can wind it up again"" is not mentioned at all by any character in this film. As it turns out, Lightning can't wind it up again. **SPOILER ALERT** In fact, he is too old to finish the race and needs a young girl car to do it for him. Did Disney not learn anything from The Simpsons?? You don't have to age animated characters. From the previews, I was led to believe that Lightning would wreck, overcome his impediments to win the race and show us all that we can do anything we put our minds to. Instead, Disney, was so busy being PC by making a girl win that they actually WERE being ageist. When you pay to see Lightning win, and he doesn't cross that finish line, you have failed as writers. I will now move on to the poor characterization of Cruz. From the color chosen for her, her dialogue, her lack of humor or connection-she was flat. Doesn't Disney have ENOUGH female heroes-heroines?? Did they have to retire one of the very FEW males-Lightning?? This was a colossally stupid decision.I guess Disney did not consult any child psychologists-or anyone with children-to find out that boys like cars more than girls. They have effectively ended their franchise. I feel the fizzle out coming. So much for the next generation of Lightning McQueen fans-I doubt many girls are going to be asking for race tracks with Cruz for Christmas."
4,Cars 3,1,23 September 2017,Not nice at all... Disappointment,We all expect our lead character McQueen to win or do something interesting every time but this movie is all opposite.... It's just about his retirement..... It talks about new generation racers who are better than the old ones.... Everything McQueen had is hopelessness... He loses all hope and hands over his career to a girl racer making himself retired..... he declares himself shower than the others and takes up a blue paint in memory of Hudson hornet and becomes a crew chief... Cars has always been my favourite Disney movies since my childhood but thus movie made me real upset...I was really not expecting this...... It is surely the worst Disney movie ever....
5,Cars 3,2,29 June 2017,Why,"Even my son was asking throughout then entire 1 hour middle portion of the movie , ""why aren't they racing, is he gonna race Jackson storm ..."". I just kept saying yeah son eventually. Then it's the female that ends up racing in the end and my 5 year old son experience his first episode of disappointment and fraud. How do you explain to a 5 year old that it's politics and the moral of the story is no longer innocent heroic comebacks but now it's about equal opportunity and forcing ideas on young minds. Kids just want to see a good , animated race movie AS ADVERTISED!!! Instead it's 10 minutes of racing, and an hour and a half of training and build up that leaves you asking yourself... did this have to be nearly two hours long?! Garbage"
6,Cars 3,1,16 June 2017,Not what I was expecting,"Not what I was expecting, *spoiler alert* franchise killed lightning McQueen, he never recovers to race again. Huge disappointment for my son, it was literally the death of lightning McQueen.Lightning McQueen then goes on to become the youngest trainer in history bringing to an end his career as lightning McQueen. McQueen gives his position to a trainer that is older than the newer model Jackson Storm, she happens to be a girl. So my son is waiting for hero to pull through and then gets shot down by McQueen giving up. The spot McQueen gives up is won by a trick and not by speed. My son is not going to cheer for a new when the old is no more. Definitely early death of number 95. Very depressing movie. The trailer was definitely misleading."
7,Cars 3,1,2 January 2018,"WORST CLIMAX, FALSE ADVERTISING,","Film makers say that a bad movie clearly falls apart. You can easily break it down for analysis, unlike a good one. ITS CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THE TERRIBLE CLIMAX OF THIS MOVIE WAS WRITTEN FIRST AND THE REST OF IT WAS JUST MADE UP ARTIFICIALLY FOR IT. Trailer advertised something else. Think of a Batman movie where Batman is having a nice time in Hawaii beach and some unknown guy does all the ninja stuff to defeat the villain. Enough said."
8,Cars 3,3,30 November 2017,it was disappointing just like my grammar skills,!!!!SPOILERS!!!!I got that some people see it as inspiring and they can relate to Cruz but the fact that they made McQueen start the rice and then they just throw Cruz in and then she does what McQueen cant and wins the race against Jackon storm that was just disappointing.Will I give it a 3/10 and I think that's being generous.
9,Cars 3,6,19 November 2017,"Better than reviews say it is, worse than I expected to be","First of all, let me get this out of my system: I've seen many 1-2 stars reviews out there. While I understand why those people are upset I think 1/10 is way too low. The movie isn't inherently bad, it's not a disastrous mess of burning oil like some reviewers make it to look. But it's not great either.The movie is lighthearted, easy to chew and fun for the most part. I wouldn't expect more from a cartoons movie. But this is Pixar so of course I expected more.I've got three major problems with this movie. First, the new characters are extremely flat and one-dimensional. The ""new"" younger cars are just jerks (all of them), there's no reason for them to behave like they behave but because they're the ""antagonists"" of the movie we need to feel mad at them I guess. So they're flat-out pretentious with zero background. The new sidekick of Lightning is also a completely basic character with an extremely contrived background story. Second, the third act feels forced and unbelievably illogical (and yes I know I'm talking about a movie with talking cars). I can't really explain this point without spoiling anything but let's say the end isn't loyal to the movie's protagonist and the end is wrapped up in a very forced manner.Third, the Mary Sue of the movie. I really don't care about overpowered female characters, I didn't even care about Rey in Star Wars. I don't care! But this new female sidekick of Lightning McQueen is just too Mary Sue to be true. Again I don't want to give away anything but I'm tired of that ""you got something that you didn't know and now you're a hero"", that's BS.So, it's a fun flick but many levels below the old good Pixar."
10,Cars 3,1,17 June 2017,"apart from good graphics, not much excitement here","I wanted to like this movie based on the earlier ones and took my kids... was I wrong, it was awful. The whole movie is based on the red car trying to get his mojo back because he's too old or needs work, and in the end he basically quits. And still gets called the ""winner."" I don't like to overly analyze movies or entertainment and will watch and enjoy things with any reasonable message about self-empowerment, until that entertainment tries to shove a ridiculous message at people --- defeatist. More or less inane level propaganda, and about how NOT to succeed at something at that. If you want to see a real comeback movie, and one that makes a little sense, just rent any Rocky. 1 through 7 (or whatever they are on....) There are tons of other good ones."
11,Cars 3,1,19 June 2017,Horrible,"I warning you all right now SPOILER ALERT. So one might believe that this film would be about lightning feeling bad after his big wreck and wanting to train and work hard to beat the car that made him feel that way but no it's about him training while everyone is tearing him down with the excessive old age jokes, and telling him that he will never be fast enough to beat the car who caused him to feel that way in the first place but despite that lightning continues to train and failing at every point which by this time who would think he would see some progress but no it's quite the opposite he gets slower and the cherry on it all toward the end of the movie it's the big race against the character Storm so lightning starts the race after the first lap he quits and sends in this flat character Cruz to take lightning's number and finish the race despite the character Cruz has no racing experience and she magically beats all the new racers including lightning's rival Storm but it gets worse after the race lightning retires from racing(despite throughout the whole movie him saying that he will never retire) and lightning becomes Cruz's coach. It gave no closure to lightning's story and not to mention the character Doc is dead without any explanation but magically the truck that trained Doc and was older than Doc was still alive which again makes no sense. So to sum it up lightning retires and becomes a defeatist. Don't watch unless you want your kids to be disappointed."
12,Cars 3,3,3 July 2017,Shocking Ending...and not in a good way.,"In this one, Lighting struggles to keep up with the new young techno cars on the circuit and has to go find his racing mojo. Along the way he meets a young racing car who is ironically his trainer, it turns out she is the one who needs the training from Lighting. Lighting teaches her his techniques, whilst trying to improve himself. For me it was a bit of a poor excuse for a Pixar film, and the ending is probably one of the worst I've seen in an animated flick. It just feels so unfulfilling and so not like Lighting McQueen. (If you do not want to know the ending do not read on!!!!)In the end, lighting makes his return to racing after training in the off season. During his big comeback race, halfway through he decides that the car he has been training deserves to try and finish the race?So instead of it being make or break for lightning, it turns into making a name for the young race car that he has been mentoring. I think the ending will be Marmite for people, some will love it and some will hate it. I personally didn't like it at all.Everything up to the ending is quite slow paced and a tad boring. Sadly Cars is another franchise that has suffered through the making of sequels. Shame."
13,Cars 3,1,25 June 2017,Disappointment for Cars' fan children,"My son was born in 2006, we watched first movie maybe a hundred times, and second one several times. Cars was like Star Wars for us. And 3rd movie? At the end of the movie my 11 years old son was so upset to see Mc Queen as a retiring loser car, he only said: ""I'll never talk about Mc Queen, this is the end"". Bugs Bunny does not get old, why did you have to retire Mc Queen so early? And we hate that yellow car, Cruz, it can never replace Mc Queen. Mc Queen is red, how could you turn it to blue?! This movie is a big disappointment, we'll try to forget it"
14,Cars 3,5,3 January 2018,Bad plot ruins movie.,"Cars 3 begins great, the whole atmosphere of Cars 1 is back. The races, the scenery when the truck rides through the country, even the music of Cars 1 reappears. Lots of fascinating details everywhere (anyone notice the Mclaren headquarters?). The story starts intrigueing, but soon takes a turn for the worst.Spoilers from here.
First question is where's Doc? Apparently he died, but how and when? It's a missed opportunity to give the movie more depth.
Then there's the storyline. Racing car gets old, can't cope with the young eager racing cars, becomes a trainer and his trainee wins. Nothing wrong with that, but the insight and transition comes DURING the final race in which they swap during a red flag period. Incredibly stupid and unlogical. Even worse is the mid part of the film where Lightning spends at least half an hour trying to find Doc's roots and his fizz. It goes on and on, the whole momentum is gone.
The plot could have been brilliant if the main race had been half way in which Lightning would lose and consequently become a trainer with his trainee winning at the end of the movie.
Last bit is the necessity to highlight feminism. Talented female trainer becomes instantly an ace racing car after shaking off her past. It's a forced plot that tastes bitter."
15,Cars 3,3,8 December 2017,One of Pixars worst films and lacked in story and humor.,"Cars 3 was not my highly anticipated Pixar film since the second movie was just pure boredom. And this series has been running downhill and can never match the first movie which was cute and fun. This third film fails and bites the dust on the track with its sequel problems in lacking a creative plot, fun humor, the characters are no longer fun, and it was quite boring as well. The plot did not stick out or did it made an improvement over the last movie. Which most of it was about the Nader the tow truck. The focus is on Lightning McQueen after losing a race with Jackson Storm. Who is a fast high tech car that reaches in 200 mph in seconds. McQueen spends most of the film trying to practice racing to face his opponent. Even with the help from Cruz, who is his trainer. They spend most of the movie racing through a desert track and beaches. Just so he can win the race. The film was no longer fun and had fun humor like the first movie. I am sure kids will still enjoy it. But for adults it was a completely boring movie. Overall, Cars 3 is terrible and a let down. Probably one of Pixars worst films to date."
16,Cars 3,2,2 December 2017,Disappointed,It was the best movie series i could have watched from my childhood. i loved it more than any Disney movie . i did not expect that it would take such a twist. Lightin Mc Queen was my hero. he is supposed to be racing not to be instructing someone how to win a race . this movie ruined the series for me. I feel horrible after watching this movie. i wished i never watched it. Cars and Cars 2 were both awesome movies but this movie is not worth watching. But if you want to ruin the series for yourself then it is up to you. i seriously did like the humor by Mator but the whole Mc Queen not racing gave me chills.
17,Cars 3,1,3 November 2017,Definitely not what was advertised. You lied Pixar :(,"I love anime, video games and comics of all kinds. Disney, Pixar, you get the picture. My whole family is like this. I loved the original cars and thought cars 2 was good too. So when I saw the posters and trailers for cars 3, I thought hey! A cool looking comeback type movie. I was so disappointed, as was everyone else I know who watched this movie.Lightning McQueen has been racing for a good 10 years and basically these newer, more technological advanced cars come along, beating everyone else. Lightning crashes ( not that this is paid any attention to) and decides to keep racing. But first he must retrain himself to get better, faster and all that. His new boss thinks he should just retire but Lightning convinces him to let him race once more. But he has to train with a new trainer called Cruz. She's loud, irritating and useless. Basically Lightning has to train her and spends the whole movie doing so. We also learn she wanted to be a racer but lacked confidence. After going to his deceased mentors hometown, Lightning trains with all these old cars (with Cruz stealing the spotlight and getting upgrades whilst Lightning doesn't) but it isn't enough. So come the time of his big race, Lightning has not got faster, better or anything. He does pretty good in the race but decides to put Cruz in the race to give her a chance to be a racer. It leads to a terrible ending that just ruins the movie. Lightning is still declared a winner, along with Cruz, and decides to train her before going back to racing. It's a very safe, yay we're all winners, hey everyone look girls can race look look look!!! (Yes we are very much aware that we can Pixar) This forced ending hasn't sat well with a lot of fans and I am not surprised. The good parts of the movie are the animation and music, so a star for those but nothing else.The bad parts are:The way Lightning is treated this whole movie. Because he's supposed to be over 30 or something, so he's portrayed as useless, age-shamed constantly, called past his prime and incapable of using technology. You can see this in how many of the cars, both younger and older treat lightning. They constantly tell him he's super old. It's sort of like semiotics, using imagery and speech to get an idea across. The idea here appears to be to make kids think Lightning is old and they need new characters. Pixar could seriously have done heaps to make Lightning better. I know that other cars throughout the series have had upgrades and mods to get faster and lighter so why not Lightning? This movie was marketed as a comeback movie. It's not. Lightning never races his rival or really trains or anything. He just looks after his useless trainer and gets made fun of. Pixar basically shoehorn him into becoming Doc when he was never even like him! And not everyone gets or becomes a mentor you know.Next would be the whole attitude towards ages and genders throughout the movie. Old people are to be made fun off and can't use tech whilst young people love tech but cannot handle the outside. This is garbage! I'm just into my 30's and love technology. I love my consoles and iPad and everything. You'll see me in the gym as much as you would outdoors. The same can be said of my friends, siblings and their kids. It's rubbish this whole lazy or technology dependent millennial or gen z kid stereotypes.Also Pixar could have had mixed gender characters throughout their cars movies, y'know more girl racers or ones who are ambiguous but no, they don't. This is their choice to not include others and now their throwing in one who feel like a cheap, Mary Sue, supposed-to be-girl-Lightning type character.Next, Cruz. If she is to be the new face of Cars, i'm Done with this series. She the technology reliant hip 20 something who cannot function outside. She's supposed to be a super trainer but she cannot train Lightning at all. She a fitness trainer at most not a race trainer. She has to be given everything. Her win at the destruction derby was only got from Lightning protecting her, even her chance as a racer was given. Lightning and the other racers worked their way through training, races, the big leagues, everything. They were pros. They worked for everything. Cruz has some talent, does some training but that's it. Plus she only does half of the big race whilst everyone else does the full thing. That's cheap and cheating. What we need are female characters who can do it themselves, work for their career. Not half-ass their way everywhere. The other characters in the movie are pretty forgettable and you see very little of the people from Radiator Springs. Sally would have been way better at coaching Lightning. It was her who got him to go back to racing in the first place.And the whole movies plot just feels like a mess of plots from other movies (creed) the first cars, with too much crammed in or not resolved, complete with lame jokes and disappointment. Seriously, I look up the word disappointment in the dictionary and see a picture of Cars 3 and nothing else needs to be said. Cannot believe that this is the end to the Cars series. I mean you don't just ruin the main character of a series like this. When I play halo, I want the Master Chief. When I play Tomb Raider, I want Lara Croft. Not only that but this film grossed 100 million less than both the other car films and is no.17 out of Pixar's 18 films. That says something about this film alright."
18,Cars 3,1,26 October 2017,Can this movie be anymore PC?,"All i have to say, way to completely ruin the franchise and take a dump at the mcqueen's legacy. Doesn't Disney already have enough female protagonists as it is? Yes, Cars 1 did great, Cars 2 was terrible, but cars 3 is horrible. I am honestly surprised to see that the third installment has got almost same ratings as Cars 1. -Okay, lets begin. The movie is really depressing if we look it from Mcqueen's view, as it turns out the true antagonist of this sequel is actually ""Age"". Yes, he is getting old and can't win against new generation of cars, but that was supposed to be the whole point, a heroic comeback that old/previous generation cars still have it that no new cars have which is on-road experience. Didn't Doc Hudson won against a new gen car by outsmarting it? Why Mcqueen had to wuss out at the final race? Despite the whole emotional build up even after the Mcqueen's crash, the movie tells us that ""Hudson was ready for a better comeback and he was ready to give it all after his major crash, but he never got the chance and eventually retired"", but Mcqueen still has the chance, and what he does with it? He gives it to the female rookie racer and she actually easily wins by the end. It was her first race at the championship and she won. I don't get it why is it that the female protagonists always have it easy. Now, kids are gonna learn that and learn life the hard way. Sure, throughout the entire movie it definitely looks like he is gonna pass on the torch, but it is just pathetic he never had his final race because he accepts, he is getting old and can't win against new generation racers, and that's how it ends. Sure, Cruz Ramirez won at the end, but it was her win, not Mcqueen's because he has given up. Whatever happened to never giving up? Sure, he could have given up his racing career after that by telling the new generation cars that he still got it, but what the heck? The old cars feels so terrible in the entire movie after being replaced by the new cars and Mcqueen was supposed to be the light and prove everyone wrong. Instead, we moved on from training Mcqueen the new way to passing on the torch to a female rookie to show everyone ladies can race too. It is quite obvious at this point that they are baiting us towards a new sequel trilogy series with new female protagonist. Disney should be ashamed, first they ruined Star Wars franchise and now this, and i only blame liberals. You know what's truly the worse? If the whole theme was opposite, it was an old female lead feeling like giving up her race career and passing on the torch to a new young rookie and cocky male racer, then i would love to see the reaction of everyone."
19,Cars 3,1,30 July 2017,PC crap!,"Let me start by saying I love the Cars movie franchise, so when I first saw the trailer and the poster for this latest instalment, I was very excited.To start off with, I was thoroughly enjoying the film and loved this whole Cars version of the Rocky Balboa films. It was great. They included Doc Hudson as a vital part of the story of Cars too, which I loved. Great character. Then comes along this new piece of crap, Cruz. I didn't like her character from the get go. Dull, annoying and about as funny as a funeral. Anyway, that was fine. Sometimes you just have to accept annoying, two dimensional characters in a film. However, what I can not bare to see is PC bullcrap. It turns out that ***SPOILER ALERT*** rather than making this miraculous comeback after all his training, Lightening McQueen quits the race. He quits and allows his trainer, Cruz (a female character of course) to finish the race. Of course she wins, of course she is the hero, of course the camera switches to other female Cars characters celebrating (wooooo women empowerment!!!!!!). I am all for equality. I really am. But this is not the case. It is so in your face and as soon as Cruz took over from Lightening, I actually wanted to leave the cinema. They have basically retired lightening and made the new Cars hero, a woman. I mean, what is that about, seriously? completely goes against the plot of the film and basically b***h slaps its viewers and fans. ""Hey folks, you think your hero Lightening, the character that makes the films, the character we know and love is going to win?! *B***H SLAP* NO! he is going to crash out and you now have a woman hero!!! yay pc guys, yaaaay!"". Literally ruined the film. Tell you what Disney, next time you want to shove some PC rubbish in our faces, write a whole new film and make the hero a woman. Don't dump on our old beloved heroes. Dicks."
20,Cars 3,3,25 June 2017,Destroys the aura of Lightning Mcqueen,"The first Cars movie is a classic that will be enjoyed for a long time to come. Cars 3 a has a few major problems. - We don't want to live in or know about whatever 'new reality' this movie has created, where Lightning isn't the fastest car anymore. We especially don't want to know that there is an entire new generation of cars that are faster than him. How depressing is that. - The movie has very little of the heart, soul, and humor of the original. It has a very different feel, with the 'next gen' cars speaking and acting like spoilt millennials. Jackson Storm is a nasty piece of work. - If feels like the point of the movie is to reinforce that 'girls can do anything' (like most movies these days). That's all well and good, but it's not what we paid money to actually go and see. We want to watch a movie about the movie's actual hero and main character, Lightning Mcqueen. And we want to see him win and NOT be depressed, old and slow most of the time."
21,Cars 3,4,17 June 2017,I've never been so bored in a movie theater before,"I went to see Cars 3 with my younger sister and, as a long-time Pixar fan, I guess I have to finally face the music: Pixar movies are simply not as good as before anymore. The first installment of Cars, even though not as beloved as some of the studio's other efforts, was a heartfelt and entertaining story for kids and adults alike. This, on the other hand, was an incoherent mess with so much boring and unnecessary dialogue it makes your head hurt after leaving the theater (but you're still happy it's all over)The movie kicks off with something I bet most kids won't even understand: Lightning McQueen is old. Yup, right. Even though he looks and sounds exactly the same, we have to accept he's old and can't compete against modern, shiny race cars. Now I don't think that's a good premise for a kids' movie, but it could give us adults something to chew on, right? Well, no. Apparently what we have to do is spend our time observing race simulators and a whole bunch of absolutely indistinguishable secondary characters telling McQueen what to do in his situation, with some race scenes thrown into the mix to keep us awake (although it had a reverse effect on me). One of them (the Thunder Hollow Speedway) was particularly messy and disturbing. It left my sister bewildered and constantly asking why are these cars so evil and why they want to kill each other.Oh, and about an hour into the movie we understand that Cruz, an annoying yellowish ""coach"" car who apparently doesn't know how to race at all, is a main character, too, and the story isn't even about McQueen proving he still got it, but about this new car, who isn't even a race car at all, magically defeating all those big bad new racers simply because girl power. Well, I'm a girl and I'm not impressed. Boring story, boring characters, and an ending that defies logic even in the world of sentient vehicles; I'm pretty sure that's the end of Cars franchise, and despite fond memories of the first movie, all I have to say is good riddance."
22,Cars 3,1,28 October 2017,A massive disappointment from pixar,"What have pixar done to the Cars franchise. I mean some of the poster art and trailers spoke of something great and powerful, where the lead character would take a serious hit and have to re-train and beat an awesome rival. Well no that is not the case it would seem.Okay so in Cars 3, racing veteran Lightning McQueen has been winning races for the past decade, when all these fancy, hybrid cars come on the scene and force all the other races to retire. Lightning however, keeps racing but makes a mistake and crashes horribly. His girlfriend encourages him to keep on racing, if that's what he wants, and so Lightning goes to his new boss, Mr Stirling and gets a personal trainer called Cruz.Stirling is the typical, neat but cool boss who says he's a fan of McQueen but is really more interested in the money he can make from his image. Which is a shame as he could have been a better character who really looked after lightning. Cruz however is the typical young, always using technology, hip fitness girl type, who is supposed to be getting Lightning back on track but really spends more time treating him like a granddad, stressing and annoying him. After losing his temper with Cruz, Lightning has to make a deal that will allow him to keep racing if he wins and goes outside to retrain with Cruz.Here is where we can see the focus of the film shift and go downhill. Cruz is useless! She is completely incompetent outside and can in no way train Lightning. He has to teach her and this goes on throughout the movie, where we also learn Cruz wanted to be a racer but never got to be one. Well that's all fine and well but your supposed to be doing your job Cruz, not moaning about your past.Anyway, Lightning seeks help from Docs old mentor and trains even more but is still overshadowed by the fact that Cruz is clearly the star of the movie and not McQueen. After getting to his big race, and doing pretty good, lightning switches Cruz into the race to give her a shot at racing ( what the hell Pixar!) where she does all kinds of super things and wins against all the pro racers. Dah dah dah dah dah dah, CRUZY POWER!!! They then say that both Lightning and Cruz win the race and so Lightning can still race but is going to train Cruz first. This doesn't solve the issue of getting McQueen back on track or beating Storm though...This movie is a mess of various rocky movie plots ( 3, 4 and creed), rehashed material from the first Cars film, bad jokes about gender and age stereotypes, as well as an unsatisfactory end to the franchise. No kid wants to see their hero made old and made fun of like Lightning was in this movie. Constantly. Mature a bit yes, and gain more depth as a character. Kids like their heroes to win, take hits and rise up again. Getting a bit older too is fine but not thrown away like this. Besides I don't see Ash Ketchum or other kid favourite characters getting much older. This is a fantasy.People came expecting to see Lightning take a hit, train, get better, then do races against an awesome rival, winning in some spectacular races. This does not happen. None of the stuff advertised like Lightning coming to get Storm was done. Yes there were changes but not for the better. Instead we get this uncomfortable, unrealistic ending that is supposed to make us think of passing on stuff to the next generation and all that but this is not what we came for or was advertised.This movie would have been better split into 2 movies, where Lightning gets more training and upgrades and beats his rival and another set a few years after, where Cruz starts from the beginning, trains with a few friends, goes through the minor league races, takes hits but gets into the pro ones. We could have then seen an ending where she has properly made and earned her way into pro racing. Not had to be given everything by lightning.Instead, Cruz is incompetent, incapable of doing her job, has a Mary Sue like backstory and skills, and basically cheats her way to fame. She does nothing. Lightning has to do all the work, give her everything, and by swapping her into the race half way through that's the same as an athlete switching with another in a marathon or something, whilst all the other athletes do the full race. Cheating. The other cars at the end should have called her out on winning whilst only doing half the race. I'm a mother and fan of strong male/female leads. I have always tried to encourage my daughter in everything and show her stuff with cool female and male characters, so she has a wide variety of hero's to look up to. But she hated Cruz. Said things like ""how can she train Lightning, she can't drive properly or he's doing everything. She doesn't understand why nearly all the other characters keep calling lightning old either, as he still looks super cool and cute. What the hell Pixar. My daughter also said if I ever bought her Cruz toys she wouldn't speak to me. I wouldn't want a toy of this car either. Cruz doesn't even look cool or race car like the way Lightning does. More like a fat faced house car.My daughter and myself are really disappointed with this movie. It could have been awesome but it's just a forced mess. I will give it one star for the animation and music being well done. But there's going to be a lot of upset kids and adults from this movie."
23,Cars 3,3,25 June 2017,The Death of Lightning McQueen and Radiator Springs.,"So, I have always been a huge fan of Cars and it's franchise. I was 9 years old when the first movie came out and as a kid I became obsessed with the movie. At the age of 20, I can say that I still love the original movie as much as I did when I first saw it in theaters all those years ago. The thing that made the movie so great was the authenticity and the realness in emotion between the characters and actors. The jokes and witty humor that was in the movie still has me laughing today at jokes I would have never understood as a child. Authenticity, great humor, and quality acting are all things that Pixar completely ignored in this new movie. From the first scene of the movie I could tell something was a bit off. The movie starts off much like the original Cars movie with the ""I am Speed"" bit where Lightning McQueen readies himself for the race, when all of a sudden you see the character, Mater, inside the trailer with him, breaking his concentration with a dumb line that's not even worth remembering (I don't remember). This scene alone gave me the impression that the quality of the movie will be mediocre, at best. It was one of those scenes where the two main characters are put into a situation in which, the director's intent is to invoke a feeling of nostalgia and sympathy for the characters as if this is the last time you will ever see them. No real humor, no real emotion, just lame character banter as if you were watching a flashback scene of a long gone character talk to another posthumously. This scene did nothing but dissatisfy me. Anyway, moving on...the acting. The acting in the movie was bad. Almost every character in the movie was delivered with a slow, monotonous, lack of emotion as if it were rushed. (this entire movie seems rushed) Even Owen Wilson, a highly respected actor and the voice of Lightning McQueen, showed very little enthusiasm. One character in particular who was probably the most disappointing was Doc Hudson's mentor, Smokey. Talk about an anticlimactic character. The actor who played the character sounded as if he were just reading lines from a paper the directors threw in front of him. Very disappointing, especially due to the immense amount of expectations a long time Cars fan would have for such a highly respected image. It's the mentor for Doc Hudson for crying out loud!The only character that had the least bit of enthusiasm was the new character, Cruz Ramirez however, her personality and dialogue was so obnoxious and out of place, it made her delivery no better than any of the other characters. If not, worse. So, acting and dialogue was pretty much one of the lowest points for this movie however, the story. Oh my God the ending. Probably the worst twist ending of any Pixar movie I have seen. Basically, after training for the ENTIRE movie, Lightning McQueen gives up. He ends up realizing that he can't complete the race so he gives up and lets Cruz finish for him. Now I am not disappointed at the fact that Cruz was able to race, I am disappointed that the entire movie gave you hopes and expectations for Lightning to rise above and win his last race victorious. Instead, all of your dreams and expectations are shot down in one moment, as if Lightning's crash wasn't sad enough. As I come to and end I would like to point out some good things about the movie. The graphics of course were stunning and beautiful. Each action scene was quite entertaining to watch especially Lightning's crash scene. The emotion and impact of that scene alone was insane. That silence...wow. The newer cars were cool to see as well even though none of them had any interesting personalities at all.Overall, I was fairly disappointed by the movie. This was the death of Lightning McQueen and all of Radiator Springs for sure. I don't see Pixar doing anything but hopefully regretting what they have done to the series. Cars 4? What's the point?"
24,Cars 3,2,1 July 2017,Weak story with all the wrong plot choices,"This movie had no dimension beyond Lightning McQueen trying to win one more race only to never actually race one more race. The other characters of the original movie make scarce appearance, and we basically spend the whole movie watching Lightning McQueen get ready to race the final big race but then never actually race the big final race (because he ""passes the torch"" to this flat and uninteresting new racer car called Cruz Ramirez who is about as interesting as a 1982 Toyota Corolla).Doc Hudson is nowhere to be found, and without explanation, and the movie has no other plot line to speak of. There is also little humor to speak of, and the only good thing I can say about this snorefest is that it was better than Cars 2. Wait, no, actually this was the worst of the three cars movies.Who does Disney get to write these lame scripts? A 12-year old?Save your money and wait until this atrocity comes out on DVD if you really want to waste two hours of your life."
25,Cars 3,3,12 July 2017,Painfully unoriginal,"Took the kids to see this early after release, figuring I'd enjoy myself as well since the original was pretty well done. Sadly, I was mistaken.The premise of technology evolving makes sense as a core story element and had potential to be interesting, but was used for nothing beyond playing into the franchise's nostalgia for the good ol' days of racing, on which the first Cars movie hung its hat.Lightning's various training methods were all obvious setups for a montage of critical moments in the big race, and for a movie which often embraces reality regarding what real cars can *actually* do, Cruz Ramirez' big finish with a literal 360 flip seemed forced and unoriginal (didn't Lightning do one in the first movie?)Speaking of Cruz, her switch into the race came completely out of left field, and seemed like another brutally forced story element. Imho, it would have been better to end the movie with ""Well, Lightning lost but hey kids, here's why it's going to be OK"" rather than ""Look how these guys can exploit a loophole in the rules! Yay, winning is all that matters!""At least the kids enjoyed their popcorn."
26,Cars 3,1,30 June 2017,They killed McQueen! and put somecar else on the screen...,"What happened?... Are they trying to shutdown some ""old"" franchises?... this movie is a total anti-climax, you go in full of expectations and go out trying to forget it... to keep the good old memories... it is sad... they completely abandoned the universe created in Cars 1 and 2 and all other spin-offs... they tried to do something new, a new perspective, but did not develop anything beyond a scratch deep... nothing makes any sense... no fun... no logical connection among story developments... I will try to forget it... but it will be though... in the end there is no hero left..."
27,Cars 3,1,16 June 2017,Even Mater cannot save this one.....,This is a classic example of Hollywood culture of trying to force a sequel even though you have no thought of idea.When I see the movie it seems that someone forced the writers to do a rush job just because a sequel had to be made.All characters look clichéd and boring. There is nothing new from a character perspective. The movie manages to be unnecessarily emotional and most events in the story look like filers which are totally unrelated to the story.They totally fail to live the magic of the original cars movie. This one is very disappointing and just outright boring. all i wish that they had left the original alone and not made this sequel.
28,Cars 3,1,18 June 2017,A disgrace to the original Cars,"I am a huge cars fan, I absolutely loved the first movie, the second movie was still really good, but the first was a classic. This movie was an absolute disgrace to the first two. The writers were different and they absolutely destroyed the atmosphere of cars. They brought in way to millennialist stereotypes and decimated the standard set by the first two movies. Things were misquoted from the first movie and characters were poorly developed. Don't waste your time or money."
29,Cars 3,1,26 July 2017,Boring and disappointing,"My son and I have really enjoyed the past two movies in the franchise. We were, therefore, very surprised to find this presumably final outing to have little of interest or to amuse. I don't write film reviews but hopefully will save someone else their time and money... Flashy nonsense Straight to video!"
30,Cars 3,2,10 January 2018,Recycling with a new PC twist,"Forget race-o-rama, the time for femme-o-rama.Cars originally recycled the plot of ""Doc Hollywood"" to create a film where the unassuming girl (car) in the back-woods town of Radiator Springs shows the hot-shot who gets stuck there for community service how to enjoy life. Take that you 80s go-go men with your ""money and fame"" priorities. Cars 2 was a mash up of sorts that mostly appeared -- at least to critics -- to be centered on Larry-the-cable-guy jokes, and their juxtaposition with Michael Caine's debonair rendition of the talking car James Bond never got from Q. All that plus blatant cultural stereotyping of ""cool"" cultures, like the Italians. It's always OK to stereo-type the Italians, right?But Cars 3 decided to forego the low-hanging punch lines of Cars 2 and return to the franchise's roots. Stealing it's plot, no less, from the abortive franchise that Pixar based on the original premise of Cars: yes, I'm referring to ""Planes"". The movie going public saw through the unoriginality of ""Planes"" relegating it's not-so-aweful sequel, ""Planes: Fire and Rescue"" to the direct-to-DVD dustbin. And it is from that dustbin that Cars 3 steals it's central plot premise. Dusty blows an engine pushing too hard. He has to take time off and goes to train in some back-country ""off the grid"" method. The thing against him -- his age. Tie things up with a heroic finale of self-sacrifice, and viola, instant movie. Did I say Dusty? ... I meant Lightning, but whose keeping track? One thing that's also easy to lose track of is the unapologetic femme-pandering of the plot. The female heroine, exposed later in the film to be suffering from low self-esteem and personal issues, essentially torpedo's Lightnings rehab program, giving him a 5 MPH treadmill routine one minute, then putting him on a full blown simulator at 300MPH because he ""insists"". And apparently her great competence in her work does not include being able to shut down said simulator in the event of an emergency. On top of this dung heap of personal responsibility, we get a girl-power transformation where the baton is passed from Lighting, the hero whose comeback was derailed by an incompetent trainer, to .... wait for it ... THE SAME TRAINER, 'cuase, ya' know, it's the 2010's ya' know, and, like, Superman is a dick but, like, Wonder Woman is awesome. And, like, 'F' the wall, so, like, maybe people will give a pass to a hero with a Hispanic sounding name, even though in any kind of just world she deserved to be fired from the moment she uttered her first line in the film revealing her incompetence.Don't get me wrong. There are some nods to the adult audience that will see the dung flying at their windshield a mile away. The only one that comes to mind is the beach training with it's reference to Rocky III, but there were others that I've simply tried to flush from my mind along with the rest of the poop from this film. Why give it 2 stars? Well, to be honest, the animation. Take a trip down direct-to-DVD lane the next time you find yourself in the children's section of your local library and you'll see what kind of low budget CGI it takes to get a 1-star rating. The CGI of Cars 3 (remember, that's what Pixar was famous for -- groundbreaking CGI) holds it's own. You might not notice it the way you noticed Sully's fur interacting with the wind, but the car's characters had a significant amount of minute digital enhancements to their details and the folks involved in the production apparently made some real efforts to be ""true-to-life"" in the design generation-to-generation design elements of the NASCAR... er... Piston Cup racers. To sum up, this movie has nothing good to offer. It's steals it's plot, and it panders to the current popular notions while purporting to voice a theme for underdogs. This film is garbage, cinematic garbage and propaganda garbage. Ang a good reason to boycott future Disney animation projects."
31,Cars 3,2,6 January 2018,What happened?,"What happened? 
Obviously Cars is over. 
My sons were disappointed that it was the end of cars. They didn't get into it when they realized that it was a girl car that will lead the so called next movie. Plot wasn't exciting and didn't keep us entranced like the other movies.
They don't want any toys.
 Lightning McQueen is done... Just like Doc Hudson, didn't need to kill him off, that was horrible. What a shame.
My daughter... Fell asleep. Besides, she likes dolls. Which I understand, she's a girl. I respect that.
Good luck next time."
32,Cars 3,5,16 June 2017,Easily the most disappointing Pixar film,"Yes that's right, this film is even more disappointing than the abomination that was ""Cars 2"". There are some truly atrocious creative choices made towards the end of the film which I will discuss in a moment. Let me first point out, however, that there is some good in this film. The first act does an alright job of setting up the stakes and character arcs. We are introduced to the new characters and it moves a long at a pretty fast pace. The second act, though a bit meandering and slow, explores Lightning McQueen's relationship with Doc Hudson. It was easily the most poignant part of the film and gave good closure to Doc's character, something ""Cars 2"" failed at altogether. Additionally, the animation is absolutely sublime and Randy Newman's score beautifully echoes that of the first movie. Where the film completely and utterly fails is the third act. Spoilers follow. The biggest issue with this film is Cruz Ramirez. She weighed down the movie in the first and second acts, and in the third act, renders Lightning useless. The film sets up an underdog story with Lightning's crash and subsequent recovery but never delivers this. Instead, Lightning gives up in the middle of the final race in Florida and passes the torch onto Cruz who, despite this being her first race and her only training for two weeks, magically wins. Lightning, the beloved racer from the first film, is completely cast aside for the annoying, moronic, and horrible Cruz. It's PC-pandering at its worst. Cruz is a complete Mary-Sue. She didn't have a shred of likability in the first two acts, but I could tolerate her because it was still Lightning's story. The third act feels like it was written by new-age feminists who completely miss the point of the ""Cars"" movies and don't at all understand the concept of a narrative character arc. What is most devastating is the fact that we never got to see Lightning rise up through the ranks, beat Jackson Storm, and finally become the fabulous racer we know he is. We never got to see Lightning WIN. The film leaves you totally deflated and empty; flustered and angry that Pixar, a studio that has proved again and again its deftness at storytelling and filmmaking craft, has fallen to the collectivist propaganda that is plaguing some films lately. If you were a fan of the first ""Cars"" film, a fan of Lightning McQueen or even a fan of great movies in general, please PLEASE avoid this one. You will only be let down like I was. I repeat, DON'T WATCH IT."
33,Cars 3,9,4 July 2017,An incredible comeback for the Cars franchise,"There will be spoilers...Oh boy, where to begin.I'll start with the elephant in the review section: The accusations of ""sexism"" and ""political correctness"". Yes, it's true, there is a female car in the film who happens to be a talented race car. The horror!! Look, I get it. I hate having a blatant agenda shoved down my throat. Ghostbusters, I'm looking at you. This wasn't that. Not even a little bit. If you think it was, well, what can I say. Maybe you should just go home to your bunker and watch Breitbart.The bigger, and I think slightly more understandable, issue is that of the overall message of the film: our heroes getting older, and the end of McQueen's career as a race car. Hey folks, time marches on. People change, even our role models. If your kid can't handle McQueen passing the torch on to a younger, more adequate player, then maybe you should plop your brat in front of the TV with Cars 1 on a loop. News Flash: this is real life! It happens in all sports. Baseball, Football, Basketball, REAL RACING! Whether we like it or not, our heroes at some point become too old to do what they do. Progress happens. We improve. As a baseball fan, I see it every single year. Players we love go away, and new blood comes in. The message in this movie is exactly that. Kids need to learn from a young age that you can't have the same guy up there doing the same thing every day. Heck, if Cars 1 took place in the 1950s and was about the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, people would be complaining about a new car called Lightning McQueen. What an incredibly boring world it would be if Lightning McQueen always won every single race and no other cars came along to improve on the sport. He isn't becoming less of a hero, he's not being emasculated. His accomplishments aren't being diminished in any way. He's helping the next generation to become a hero too! And so what if that new hero is female? By taking this apparently contentious route, Pixar has opened up the Cars franchise to years and years of new material. New heroes will emerge and some will go away. I for one am delighted by this new direction. I was concerned with the let down that was Cars 2 that the third installment would be useless. It wasn't, not even remotely. Cars 3 is fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My 3 year old son, who is obsessed with McQueen, loved it too."
34,Cars 3,4,30 July 2017,Ultimate Anti-Climax,"To be honest the story started really solid and quite interesting with (by what the trailer told to be) a more mature and unorthodox approach to the cars franchise. After Cars 2 I personally expected a large improvement, and for the most part, there was.The characters themselves are the same we know and love, and though the plot was quite rushed and a little lackluster due to the let-down Doc Hudsons' mentor turned out to be, it was quite enjoyable.I was ready to settle on a seven or extend to an eight, but then the ending came around. It's a kids movie, so it was to be expected a twist like in the original Cars was to occur, but the problem with this is that Cars 1 had a rookie lightning McQueen, ready to take on another day. But in this movie- not only is the purpose denied, but forms Lightning into a defeatist unlike the confident yet respected character he grew to be.The problem in Cars 3, mainly- is purely that the built up rivalry between an actual challenge to the now veteran McQueen, is easily defeated, after McQueen literally gives up the race to 'give the chance' to Cruz.The gesture is meant to be kind and all, but honestly- it ruined a good 80% of the movie and its' build-up of the rivalry. A simple and predictable, yet well executed plot, is far better than a rushed attempt at a morally acceptable ending aimed to teach kids the meaning of maturity whilst ruining the point of the title.Lightning's final race, turned into him giving up half-way to let a complete rookie beat what seemed to be an extremely fast and talented super car.The cinematography was well-executed, and the comedy quite nice, all the while holding to the main issue but ultimately ruined by what most and myself consider to be one of the biggest anti-climaxes I have seen to date.Though I enjoyed the depth on Doc, and his background- as well as Lightning's growth- the ending and plot choice ruined a potential masterpiece of a film.Better luck next time Pixar."
35,Cars 3,2,19 June 2017,Stalled in pit lane....,"As a huge supporter and fan of the first CARS film, and not caring at all for the 2nd, this one was phoned in, lacked the ""SOUL"" and interest of the original. The parts are there, the deep drama and personal problems but it failed to flow. Just plodded along from thing to thing until the big climax ending. The ending was fine, but I have zero desire to ever watch this again, and won't be buying the disc, and WILL be watching the original again to re-feel everything that was missing here. And it is almost too deep for kids. Lots of talk about life and retiring from it, and not lots of kid style hijinks.It looked great and had a story, but felt like a cash grab --- or that all the original PIXAR writers were not involved."
36,Cars 3,2,26 July 2017,Predictable and Boring,"Took my kids a boy and girl to see this and within the first 30 minutes, my little girl rolled her eyes and already knew how the story would end. Disney is ruining these classic movies with whatever agenda they have. Almost all things Disney these days are predictable and unimaginative. My son didn't like it, neither did my daughter and at the end of the night, I wanted my money back."
37,Cars 3,3,2 August 2017,This movie is a CAR-tastrophe,"This is the proof that when you delay a movie that everyone was waiting for (Incredibles 2) to force one that no one wanted.Cars 3 is mediocre and I never believed in their success. Maybe my review is overshadowed by my anger with their decision with Incridibles 2. But like many pointed this is animated movie, they don't need to age. That was a bad decision although they did that call for Cars 2 and people let it slip and they thought let do it again."
38,Cars 3,8,7 September 2017,Ignore all the bad reviews!  This was a good movie.,"** Possible Spoilers **First off, I have no idea what these other reviewers are talking about with this ""alternate universe"" theory. The fact is this movies ties perfectly with the first one. All the same characters are in the movie from the first one and many references are made to Doc, so not sure how this thought came about. This movie is essentially a version of cars where Lightning McQueen actually aged, meaning he is not the same age as in the first one. With age, especially in sports, comes new, and younger, talent. In this movie lighning McQueen is faced with this same challenge, new, younger, talent who are training in new, more advanced, ways. With this younger talent and better training methods (Lightning McQueen still trains like he did under Doc) Lightning is having a tough time competing against the new guys. He essentially has to make a choice, adapt with new training or retire. I won't go into the details of his choice as I don't want to spoil it for anyone. However, this movie was very good and, I thought, a fitting end to the franchise. Can you imagine a Rocky movie where Rocky never ages and just keeps fighting and beating everyone? No, and that is not how the Rocky series ended. Rocky retired and helped the new up and coming fighter. That is somewhat what happened here. I can only assume the others making the reviews wanted Lightning to be perpetually young and just keep racing and racing and beating everyone, movie after movie. The writers wisely chose not to follow that formula. Yes, I will agree, there is a bit more of a story here than just pure racing, and perhaps that is what people didn't like. However, that didn't make it a bad movie. I hated Cars 2 but I did really like Cars 3. It's not a perfect movie but also isn't what people are making it out to be. Give it a chance and I think you will like it."
39,Cars 3,2,22 June 2017,An uninspired borefest,"I am one of those guys who actually liked the first Cars film. That one had a soul. Then came the second installment, which was even better - one of those rare sequels that did not feel forced or redundant.And then Cars 3 came along to spoil it all.How bad is it? Well, bad enough that a kid next to me could not wait for the film to be over. And bad enough that I was struggling not to fall asleep due to pure boredom. The middle part of the film (like from 15min in to about 15 min before the end) is mostly a blur for me - it was that bad. They say that with any story, you want to leave audiences questioning ""And then - what happened?"" so that the story shows ""and then - this happened, and then - this..."" but this film has nothing happening. There was tons of talk, reminiscing, fear of old age, but nothing worth watching.One saving grace is the film's visuals. And there was one camera move I loved. That was it.Oh, in case you have heard of the ending, which I will not disclose here - it feels terribly forced. Lightning McQueen makes a random decision that is supposed to make us feel all warm and fuzzy, but it doesn't. It just leaves everyone with the big WTF on their face, and rightfully so, because it is so out of character and so stupid. So, the ending does not work, as much as it was cute as an idea. Good ideas need to be well executed to work, otherwise they fail.All in all, the story feels like a typical Hollywood ""paint by numbers"" screenplay which was developed by going over McKee's or some such author's check list, and then going like this:Start with action on page 1? Check. - Unexpected ending? Check. - Lots of dialogue in the middle part? Check. - Take care of the minorities? Check.And so on. Painting by numbers never produced anything worthwhile.Story must come from the heart if it is to work, otherwise you get Cars 3 - an uninspired borefest.Essentially, Cars 3 is a 10 minute story stretched to painfully long 110 minutes. I was shocked when I discovered that it was that long - for a CG feature with no story, those extra 10 minutes are both expensive and meaningless."
40,Cars 3,1,24 October 2017,Thought we would finally see McQueen win......we never will it seems.....,"The movie starts with Lightning as a 10 year veteran in the racing world and at the top of his game. Then the racing board, for some reason, lets all these new hybrid cars force all the older racers out, except Lightning, who crashes. Months later, with no mention of his injuries or his trauma, Sally gets Lightning to go back to racing. After meeting his new boss, Lightning gets a trainer called Cruz, to help get him back in shape. But Cruz is clearly not a good trainer as she spends more time trying to get Lightning to name his tires, nap, goes overboard on the excessive age-shaming, and he ends up losing his temper.Lightning makes a deal that will allow him to continue his racing career, if he wins, and goes to train outside but has to take Cruz, who is again, useless. He has to teach her everything and this goes on throughout the film, and she in no way does her job of training Lightning. He loses his temper with her and we find out that oh! She always wanted to be a racer but was told she couldn't and wimped out. Boo boo! Lightning goes and visits his mentors mentor and this Smokey guy helps somewhat though the old cars from the 1940's take delight in pointing out how old and useless Lightning is, which seems very hypocritical, and Cruz is still incompetent.Looking thoroughly disheartened, Lightning leaves for his race, starts in last place but works his way up to 15/43. Then he hears Cruz being told she's not a racer, takes pity on her, puts her in the race and she then annoys the top racer, does stunts and has Lightning talk all cutesy to her, then wins. They then basically retire Lightning. This is a very basic description of what goes on in this movie. The trailers had us believing that this was going to be some sort of awesome, comeback movie. The whole ""I'm coming for you, Storm"" thing? Doesn't happen. Instead the movie is just a mess of various movie plots mashed together, rehashed plots from the first film, constant age-shaming ( seriously, they never stop calling Lightning old in this) and PC messaging. The animation was good though and the music is decent. I did like the little flashbacks Lightning has of Doc, very sweet. However, they felt like a forced plot to get Lightning shoved into retirement for this knock-off character, who cannot even fulfill her job to as trainer to Lightning. But then this movie is really about Cruz and her being the new star of Cars and retiring McQueen. Yes, athletes can only do their thing for so long but McQueen is a fantasy character. Also other cars from the franchise got upgrades like full carbon fiber bodies, upgraded to gas/electric types, newer spoilers, exhausts and engine tweaks. Why not Lightning? (think of all the toys his new look would have sold)Cruz didn't even earn her place as a racer, she had to be given it. Lightning and the other racer all went through all kinds of training, practices, races and worked their way up. She had some racing skills from her past and McQueen taught her stuff but she never works for her place like the others. I'm not sure this is a good message for kids, girls in particular. It's like saying just cruz, yeah I went there, through life and wait for someone to give you stuff. Don't waste time learning/knowing/working for something properly. The whole 2 cars winning the race is cheating. I know in real life a driver can swap with another, using the same car. Here though, the cars are athletes and so by switching in Cruz, that's just like a runner tagging in another whilst all the other runners do the whole race. Not fair at all.Cruz could have been great. She could have been a phenomenal trainer, who knew the racing world on all levels and looked after Lightning, been the brains behind him, trained him on the tech and outdoors. Instead, being a trainer is shown as second rate and she's stereotyped as the younger, better, smarter, technology reliant gen z kid, who cannot function outdoors. Whilst Lightning is the ""damn you kids and your techno whatnots. Get outside and play!""..... Bleh..The newer cars were all boys and this is Pixar's fault entirely. This is a fantasy world. It doesn't have to reflect all the nonsense in real life They could have had girl racers, boys, butch girls, pretty boys, asexual, etc. They could have made it so the Cars world already was all-inclusive, where they didn't have all these gender/race issues. Kids would see that it was normal to except everybody more if they saw it as normal in their media. But nope. Pixar can't do that. Also, Jackson Storm, Lightning's supposed rival, is rarely seen and is nothing more than a mouthy, antisocial, gen z stereotype that just feels kinda meh as a character.I know it's a kids movie and you're not supposed to look to much into it but when I went to see the film, no one was laughing, kids were upset, some people just left. My nephew and nieces hated the film. My friends and their kids also disliked it. The only plus is that Lightning said he was only training Cruz for the season and then going back to racing. Maybe Pixar will finally listen and give us the real racing experience that we asked for, showing us champion Lightning. It's all fine to give stuff up for others, be kind and all that but you are also allowed to be good at something for yourself. To win/earn something, feel good and not have to give it up. Isn't that what part of life is? Oh well.."
41,Cars 3,4,22 June 2017,Review from a Pixar fan,"I have been a big Pixar fan ever since the first Toy Story. I have seen almost all the Pixar movies and I can say this is their worst movie after The Good dinosaur... and unfortunately dinosaurs and cars are probably my son's favorite objects and I was just a bit disappointed they couldn't get them right. I don't have anything more to say except graphics is the usual great quality from all Pixar movies but it still hasn't kept me from falling asleep. Overall, a poor movie by Pixar 's lofty standard but if u lower your expectation you might enjoy it."
42,Cars 3,1,28 June 2017,last is the worst,at one point i thought i was listening to an audio book.mater was left out.worst story line .lightning mcqueen retirement processes went through a long long scattered short stories.too much dialogue used and less cinematic expression.i think they want to sell more toys this time as they changed macqueen's get up 5/6 times.too many new characters and none of them could touch your heart.so the movie PLANES 3!!! coming soon.
43,Cars 3,5,25 July 2017,Very unfortunate script & plot given it's place in the series...,"Our family has been big Cars fans since 2006. My boys(while outgrown them) have tons of Cars toys. Their room is still decorated in the theme. We've been to DL to Carsland 2012.Onto the film.I really only have 2 substantial issues with this film. 1. It's complete ignorance that Cars 2 ever happened. If Cars 2 didn't exist, this film on most ends could've fit in the series nicely. You can't take back the past... Cars 3 could've been a prequel... (with a different script entirely)2. The race switcharoo of Lightning & Cruz during a race. I mean, really?? This is beyond mind boggling to me that this was a good idea. She goes from a sorta clueless & naive personal trainer to better than the best race car in the world, who lets her switch places in the middle of the race?I'm sure this film will appeal to some young families who don't know the series well or aren't critical of storyline progression or have any knowledge of racing. My boys @ 11 were disappointed. They said it didn't make sense. 5 out of 10 just out of respect for the artistry."
44,Cars 3,4,21 July 2017,"Never really got into gear, the 'Cars' franchise has run out of gas","Am a big Pixar fan, feature films and short films. As far as feature films go, the 'Toy Story' franchise, 'Inside Out', 'Up' and 'Wall-E' were particularly fantastic, while 'Presto', 'One Man Band', 'Geri's Game' and 'Piper' were particularly great short films.The 'Cars' films are often considered lesser Pixar efforts, for reasons that are understandable. To me they are towards the bottom as well, though the first 'Cars' film was still very enjoyable if not perfect and while the second film had a lot of problems to me it wasn't that awful. Seeing 'Cars 3' during my four day hiatus from IMDb (but had not yet gotten round to reviewing), from personal opinion it was underwhelming and the short film that came with it, 'Lou', came over much better.Some will disagree, others will agree, but 'Cars 3' (expecting pitchforks and stones to be thrown, because some will consider this a blasphemous statement to make) for me was the worst of the three and replaces 'The Good Dinosaur' (which still wasn't too bad a film) as Pixar's weakest.'Cars 3' does have its strengths. The animation is fantastic, it's rich in colour, gorgeously designed and the attention to detail is incredible. The racing scenes are mini-masterpieces of editing as to be expected.There is also an energetic and nostalgic music score, a few of the jokes are funny and the voice acting is uniformly great, Cristela Alonzo taking top honours. A few neat little touches, like the dashboard as well.For all those good things, a lot didn't work. Too many of the jokes backfire, due to too much of a recycled feel and very tired timing. The more emotional parts to me lacked heart and soul (though there are a couple of parts that did), so it never came over as poignant (coming from someone who cried like a baby during the emotional moments of 'Toy Story 3', 'Inside Out', 'Up' and 'Wall-E').While there is a story and it is not as cluttered or as confused as the second, it does plod along too much, with a very sedate middle act before coming to life at the end (the climax is good and has some excitement), and seemed too thin for the running time, which it tried to hide with padding, some of which added little.Didn't get emotionally invested in the characters, and, even with the intentionally flawed ones, never learnt enough about them and found some difficult to like. Cruz had real potential but felt underdeveloped to me, although she did bring a little heart to a film that lacked it elsewhere. Meanwhile Lightning never really grew as a character and Mater, while with less screen time than before, is a bit annoying.Overall, disappointing film that never really kicked into gear and a sign of the franchise running out of gas. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
45,Cars 3,5,11 July 2017,"In 2017, this film series has finally run out of gas. And the bad news is.. that's a good thing.","Cars 3 is a predictable, anticlimactic, decently acted, and full of small continuity errors film, yet it still features some of the best visuals in animation to date. Although this film was still enjoyable at times, I never really connected to the characters like I did in the original film over ten years ago. Sure this film was good enough for young kids, but to me it wasn't, and I decided to give Cars 3 an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. Sadly the Cars franchise had such great promise when it originally took to the road back in 2006. Now in 2017, this film series has finally run out of gas. And the bad news is.. that's a good thing.Read more at theVade."
46,Cars 3,4,16 August 2017,rocky 3 or rookie 5,"The Movie reminds me Rocky 3, our hero loses face on a younger rival, his mentor does not exist anymore, it is necessary for him to find other reference marks.Whereas the one was an improbable film and supers funny  The second was a pastiche of spy film, on the ecological wave with a beautiful competition between two cars so different but animated with the same desire of victories.This one is too dramatic, lacks of jokes and genuine story line  It is a mixture between a victorious come back and the hand-over between the master and the rookie..So it is very confusing, the plot is then impossible and bad written.. how a car/pilot can finish a race started by another car/pilot ?At the end, I did not laugh and I did not like the plot"
47,Cars 3,4,26 June 2017,Good enough,"Cars 3 is not like the rest of the Cars movies, though it tries recapture some glory from the first movie. Didn't mind the new characters, they were interesting in their own way. However, it would have been good to also have some of the old characters in there as well, and not just at the beginning and at the end. Other than that, the story is okay, with some action (though, they could have added some more) and a great twist in the end, that, at least, helped pull the movie out of the cliché pit. Finally, the special effects were nice, with the cars almost looking like real ones, especially at certain scenes, where even the scenery looked real. So, overall, 4 out of 10."
48,Cars 3,4,16 June 2017,"Old Cars, New Cars, I Say, Two Stars","Three movies and countless Mater-shorts later, I still want to know how a world inhabited by live automobiles could exist with our own landmarks. Following from the previous installments, Cars 3 wants me to believe older cars are made of older models, and newer cars are made of newer models, never mind their biology of reproduction. But now it wants me to believe crabs live on their beaches. It even continues to parody itself by putting up ""re-tire-ment"" ads on the freeway. ​ Even by the standards of Pixar's nonsensical world, it still makes no sense. Each act felt increasingly made up on the spot throughout production, with a phoned-in self-contradicting message thrown in last minute. This stated logic just raises more questions than answers, like, why does such a franchise exist from a studio made famous for telling emotive stories for a new generation of storytellers? Yet, as long as parents know about the ""good messages"" of their kids' programs, we can rest easy at night, right?Well, the third installment could rightfully replace that bad James Bond parody's mere existence, for it returns to the contrast between old and new ways of living driven by the first movie.Lightning McQueen starts a new rivalry against a younger, newer racer who aspires to be better than him. Now Lightning has become the veteran about to finish his last race alongside a popular rookie, a direct role reversal from where he started. It parallels how the sports industry always worked: it brings in newer, younger racers who trained via virtual reality simulators. It does get a bit funny to see the contrast between old and new sport traditions, such as when Lightning meets his new trainer, Cruise, in preparation for his race against these high- tech cars. She makes him feel out of touch against the changing times, and he makes her feel inept for driving on a beach. Lightning's old mentor Doc Hudson also gets a more proper tribute than the previous movie. The addition of this mentorship legacy adds a strong common ground to meet between all viewers.Pixar's team has always mastered intergenerational stories the whole family can enjoy, and now they mastered making movies no generation can enjoy. I mean it: a little girl next to me in the theater kept impatiently getting off her seat. Another 9-ish year old boy, who falls under the target demographic, made a bit of noise too.As for the older viewers, some of the remnants of Pixar's glory days of innovating animation could still please. But compared to Disney's latest achievements, the animation quality here looks so lackluster, you could mistake any frame here with a frame captured from either of the two previous installments. Look at Pixar's other visual splendors: Finding Nemo, WALL-E, and Up, there is currently a real lack of care about keeping up to date on the animation trends.Cars 3 attempts to entertain the older folks and younger folks at once, which in turn leaves each of them equally bored. Kids have no care about what racing was like in the 1950's, nor would parents pay to see a display of high-tech cars. Good quality humor cannot be found here, including silly childish humor fit for eight-year-olds, particularly by the now nearly absent Mater. Maybe a brief, ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" joke could land, except we already moved on from Life Alert's contagious catch phrase.To top it off, the Cars franchise continues its reputation of offending minority groups outside of US sports by tossing in a demolition derby for no real reason other than to make that culture look unappealing. Oh, believe me, it gets worse. For no reason whatsoever, Luigi and Guido, the two Italian cars from Lightning's little small-town home, the most culturally insensitive characters from the first movie, join Lightning in his high-tech training. Again, these two amicos offer no comic relief, moral support or anything else. The only reason I can think of for their prevalence is to make the American cars look better in comparison.Despite what the half-hearted messages want parents to think, the merchandising proves that Cars 3 carries no hard opinions about the old way of doing things. Think: how many of these sold spin off toys look like older car models? Although it proves the craftiness of Disney: their marketing utilizes nostalgic throwbacks for the parents, guaranteeing a higher emotional response from the buyers. The kids who are sold into Pixar's franchise deserve better than a confused, phoned in commercial."
49,Cars 3,3,26 June 2017,Below average and boring,"I have watched Cars 1 more than hundred times along with my son. Will be able to watch again without getting bored. But the Cars 2 not living up the expectation. But Cars 3, is just plain, boring and lame. The dialogues and story line are no way in line with the Cars 1 level. And the climax (making McQueen out and replaced by another car, really?) made it worse. Hope they will end this series now."
50,Cars 3,2,5 November 2017,Extremely depressing movie,"I am not going to lie, I loved the first cars. It was a great movie in my opinion. After the disaster of Cars 2 I was looking forward to seeing what was going to happen to the franchise.Oh boy was I in for something special. The entire movie is about McQueen after he gets into a car accident. He is very much pressed to retire by his corporate sponsorship. His corporate manager gives him one more chance to make a come back. He has to beat the new racer Jackson Storm who is this worlds equivalent of an over privileged millenial. The whole movie is building up to the big race. He is training with his trainer who also happens to be a female named 'Ramirez'. You can tell that something happened in the storyboarding that screwed the movie up but I still cant figure out what it is. By the end of the movie McQueen goes to many different places to train, including Doc Hudsons old mentor, and guess what happens after all that work and build up. He loses.I just remember how depressing that was to watch in theatres. Instead of the movie building up on the stuff like ""outsmart your enemy"" and ""exploit weaknesses"" the movie just says screw it. McQueen gives up halfway through the race and lets the female girl car win it instead because apparently all that training and build up really had no point to it anyways. And oh god what a cop out at the end the producers did. At the end when the lady car wins, the screen at the top 'updates' and puts McQueen and girl lady car in first place. So whats the moral? The moral is if you are old and don't think you can do something, just give up. Thats right give up you pathetic over the hill non-millenial. Honestly whats the point. Forget about honor or dignity, just let the millenials and kids with their """"high tech"""" gadgetry to it instead. Thats the kind of vibe I was getting. And I am not even a gen x or baby boomer, I am generation Z for crying out loud.So whats the moral? It must be you cant win them all? But whats the point of the movie if its going to be written like a come back story but the main protagonist loses in the most dishonorable way possible. It would have at least been better if he had just naturally lost and not given up. Instead he just gives up halfway through because he doesn't think he can win. What kind of message does that tell our kids?"
51,Cars 3,9,12 June 2017,Speed with heart,"#Cars3 is speed with heart. It's fun, exciting and emotionally endearing. The first film was about a lost small town USA and the humbling of a cocky racer. The second movie didn't quite know what it wanted to be, part espionage, part mistaken identity, part global tournament, all wrapped up in a poor attempt to address friendship. But this third installment is about the racer becoming the mentor while at the same time honoring the legacy of a very important person in McQueen's life, Hudson Hornet, who's voiced by the the late great actor whom we cinema deeply miss seeing on screen, Paul Newman.In ""Cars 3,"" Lightning McQueen suddenly finds himself blindsided by a new generation of blazing fast racers. He's seeing himself and his fellow race mates forced to retirement. Refusing to be told when he should call it quit, McQueen is determined to get back in the game, acquiring the help of a new sponsor and a young trainer who's secretly wanting to be a racer. But all that only brings McQueen to the doorstep of his own inspiration, the late fabulous Hudson Hornet. This enlightenment will prove once again whether or not Lightning McQueen still has what it takes to be a champion.It's obvious from ""Cars 3"" that Pixar had learned the lessons of their mistake or blunder that was ""Cars 2."" The story in ""Cars 3"" is more coherent, clear and straightforward and it goes back to Pixar's strongest strategy which is to appeal to our deepest emotions. It doesn't necessarily rehash the first film, but more of presenting our hero deciding for himself to take on the next chapter of life that is just as fully rewarding as beating his opponents on the race track, which I think is a well put progression in McQueen's evolution as a character.I think you'll be wowed at the film's excellent effort in pulling parallels between Hudson Hornet's experience and what McQueen is going through. It's like every piece fits into its place naturally, like it's meant to be. The new rival, Jackson Storm makes the cocky McQueen in the first film look tame. You don't see much of Mater this time around, but that's actually not a bad thing. You'll love some of the new racing tricks that ""Cars 3"" has up its sleeves, I'm entertained by them and I'm not even a Nascar fan. And the rookie/trainer who secretly wants to race, Cruz Ramirez will surprise you at every corner, that one is like a an eager young prodigy whose skills are just waiting to be discovered given the right opportunity. The themes basically ask the inevitable questions of what we all should do when we get older and are no longer able to do some of the things we love, what would be the the options then. And so I think ""Cars 3"" does an excellent job of letting you know that if you've reached the point of success, we should then do our part to now guide, train, teach others to reach their point of success too. Don't burn the bridge behind you.-- Rama's Screen --"
52,Cars 3,3,7 July 2017,"Boring, meandering plot","This moving was really boring. The plot was slow and there was no action. There were several particularly slow scenes. Even my kid got bored and we left the theater early. Turns out I forgot my keys, so we had to go back in. My kid changed her mind and we watched until the end and it still sucked. What a letdown. She has no interest in cars anymore. I guess it's more Paw Patrol and Doc McStuffins for us."
53,Cars 3,1,15 July 2017,Worst,My kids feel asleep. Does that say it all. It was slow pace and very little funny moments. We saw despicable me 3 last week and it was great and they laughed forever. This was a wast of money and time. My kids said they felt like we was in the theater for days later. They can't tell me one single moment from the movie.
54,Cars 3,4,1 July 2017,Boring and Predictable,This was a MASSIVE step down from the original. Even the sequel was better than this movie. It feels like Pixar just wanted to give Closure to the franchise and make a quick buck in the Laziest way possible. If you are a fan of Cars 1 or 2 I still suggest seeing it......when it's available for rental.
55,Cars 3,10,20 July 2017,Awesome,"Cars 3 is probably just as good as the first one. Way better than Cars 2! It is really emotional. It has some good laughs! The story is amazing! The characters are great. I liked the new trainer Cruz Rameriez's character. We get some older cars and new younger generations like Jackson Storm. Good Ending (NO SPOILERS I PROMISE!). If you really like Cars 1, you're gonna love Cars 3!"
56,Cars 3,1,15 October 2017,Dreadful,"1. Awful. ! 2. Boring. ! 3. Endless. ! 4. Repetitive. ! 5. Nerve wrecking nonsense. ! 6. Just plain stupid. ! 7. The first ""Cars"" is wonderful. The third ""Cars"" belongs in the trash.Avoid this almost two hour tour of misery!I can't find anything positive to write about this piece of crap movie."
57,Cars 3,5,14 July 2017,"More original than the first, irritatingly flawed.","With a Toy Story 3-esque story of accepting change and moving on Cars 3 could have been a great and truly touching movie. However, instead of an endearing, late-in-life coming of age tale of learning to gracefully grow into the next stage life has to offer, we're left with a film who's ultimate morale is that it only takes one inexcusably bad trainer to firebomb a decorated career and p*** on the burning ash remains.Making it worse is that the character's utter incompetence at meeting the needs of her client or fulfilling her most basic job functions is overlooked due to her unprofessional, gendered emotionalism. The viewer is left with the lingering suspicion and bad taste that Lightning McQueen could have, if not won, then at least ended with a fight, rather than the close to cop-out we're treated with, if only he'd dumped the film's most-annoying character on the side of the road and never looked back. Ultimately, the film is watchable and entertaining in parts, but cripples itself from being truly memorable."
58,Cars 3,6,6 July 2017,Mary Sue Becomes A Racer,"This was a completely disappointing effort. I think we have to acknowledge that Pixar's tank is empty at this point. It was a very muddled, confused story, with minimal plot, just a few set pieces strung together. I appreciate Lightning's character arc, but it didn't pay off. OK, he's getting old, starting to get beat by the younger, higher tech cars. Interesting premise. At the beginning, they ignore the idea that cars can actually change their tech - could Lightning try to ""get in shape"" by improving his aerodynamics, suspension, handling, etc.? No, he just gets old and gets bypassed. And he's aided by a ""trainer"" who expects to get him ready for a race in just a couple weeks, by putting him on a 5 MPH treadmill. She's pretty inept, I expected her to get thrown by the wayside.BUT WAIT! The inept trainer is actually a racer! Who's never raced before? But, a day racing on the beach, a night on a moonshine run, and a few days on a dirt track, and a demolition derby, make it clear to us that this is now a main character. A boring, predictable, main character.SPOILERS FOR THE ENDING HERE.And the final twist is the most unrealistic thing I have seen in a movie in years, I can't understand how this made it past the first draft of the script. You know how, if you don't run any qualifying heats, you get to race in the championship, you just have to start last? No? You know how, in a marathon, they just let anyone trade numbers, and the person finishing the race is not the person who started? Really, you don't? And how you can just pick someone out of the crowd to finish the race for you, they don't have to be on your team, or regulated in any way by the race? You don't? Well, the writers of this movie know all those things. You know how, if you have no idea about the rules of a game or sport, and you try to write a movie about it, you risk making something completely unrealistic, that takes the audience out of its suspension of disbelief entirely? The writers of the movie never heard that rule either. And the movie ends on this absolutely farcical idea, which is awful. Even worse, Lightning's story arc is resolved in an unsatisfying way, and Cruz's story arc was set up so inartfully that it basically means nothing to her. And it certainly meant nothing to me as a viewer.Still, better than Cars 2."
59,Cars 3,5,30 August 2017,this is a OK movie,"this movie was actually OK not as bad as i thought and when i saw the trailer i thought it was going to be terrible but it wasn't that bad this movie was boring most of the time. the writing was OK thought. even thought it was really slow paced i could still understand the pilot, point, and message in this film. the characters weren't that great either because they didn't feel original enough. overall this movie is not original. the jokes weren't funny either. overall a OK movie but could of been way better. it had a few good qualities but a lot of bad ones. this movie needs much more work."
60,Cars 3,5,20 June 2017,Lost focus,"*** This movie is both politically correct and sexist. This is common with most movies today ***This movie really lost its way. What made the first movie so great was the heart between Sally, McQueen and Mater and the absence of political correctness and sexism. That was sadly an issue in this movie. Both Sally and Mater dialled in their performances through lame scripts, a major let down. Chick Hicks was extremely weak, although his colleague in nastiness (Certain) played the part well. Thankfully, McQueen was solidly played by Owen Wilson. Without him, there would be no heart to this movie. While Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzon) had some heart, her role as the ""victim"" was borderline insulting and has become a cliché ad nauseam. She would have been much better marginalised in the same way McQueen was in the first movie (ie. not the ""McQueen was marginalised because he was a woman"" tripe that's become so popular in the modern age of victimhood). Pixar just can't get past this sexism. It's impacted their last 1/2 dozen movies. Enough already Pixar.Ultimately, the movie didn't work well because of lacklustre characters, the lack of chemistry between the characters (especially Sally and McQueen) and the usual cliché in most movies today (women are all victims). If you are tired of political correctness, give this one a miss. Go and watch The BFG on DVD. Despite having a strong female lead, that movie skipped the political correctness without missing a beat. It can be done Pixar, it can be done. Pixar have just lost their way."
61,Cars 3,9,14 June 2017,Everything you hoped for and didn't get in Cars 2,"They realized that when they make a movie just so they can continue to merchandise the brand, people will probably be angry. Well, it took them a few movies to realize it (Cars 2, Planes, Planes 2), but that's right, folks, Cars 3 wasn't a horrible, plot-less, mess of an excuse for a toy commercial. Instead it was heartfelt, eclectic, smart, and finally delivered the sequel that Cars deserved, just a few years and a total flop later.What made the original Cars great was the fact that it managed to easily weave interesting and likable characters within a plot that was equal parts ""hot-shot popular athlete learns a lesson"" and ""remembering Main Street U.S.A in its glory days."" Cars 3 triumphed in similar regard. Lightning McQueen is back and knocked down again, there's same eclectic look back at the past (with great shots of US highways scenes that make you want to take a road trip), and all the old characters you love being utilized properly (yes, we are still salty that Mater got his own sequel because he cannot carry a movie on his own). Add that to the subtly feminist plot-line (be prepared for boycotts), intriguing and well- written new characters, a whole lot of heart-string tugging and you've got the movie we all wished we could've seen when Cars 2 came out.It's far from perfect. There are some issues with the story line and at sometimes it was so slow we were bored (and obviously so were some of the children in the audience based on the noise and commotion). The narrative starts at a very high point and then takes a few dips and dives as it rolls along, but thankfully makes it's way out of those potholes quickly and grabs your attention back just as quickly as it lost it.The soundtrack leaves a lot to be desired with no more road-tripping, car driving, top down tunes left after the first (though the score of this film is far superior and samples from not only the original, but also other Pixar outings, which is fabulous). It's predictable, but it's also a Disney movie so that's not completely off-the-wall. It was good for a sequel, especially knowing that it could've been another disaster, they've learned their lessons well."
62,Cars 3,7,15 June 2017,"entertaining, moving, has a good moral for children, and a quantum leap up from Cars 2","Aside from what should be obvious to most of those who are over the age of 5 - merchandising, merchandising! I can hear Yogurt from Spaceballs say (which this movie does try to sort of, kind of, almost satirize but doesn't quite get there, and I'll get to that later) - I wondered going in why Pixar would make Cars 3. The first Cars, one of those unlikely passion projects for John Lasseter, was fine though not remarkable unless one didn't mind getting their Paul Newman fix (last movie too!) if it meant wading through the ""comedy"" of Larry the Cable Guy, and the sequel was one of the most mediocre films of the past decade, from anywhere (again, Larry the Cable Guy as the protagonist). But then I thought that this was exactly why it would be interesting to see the movie - what would the Pixar creative team come up on this one. What they came up with was a good movie, no more but no less either.Aside from a far smaller quotent of scenes with that grating Mater character (I'll get off it now but, really, who really was hungering for more of Mater in their movie theater in 2017?), this is another example like Monsters University where the filmmakers are favoring a strong message over having a simple villain. And, curiously enough, while both movies do feature Nathan Fillion as an almost/would-be antagonist, it's not about that (it can't be coincidence that in both movies he voices the show-off, cocksure figure, right? - actually Armie Hammer is more-so that character here, but nevermind), I suspect that the message was what was key for those in the story room. What could make Lightning McQueen interesting again after all these years? Was he even interesting to begin with? It's not even him so much as it is what a character's arc is, and what Pixar taps in pretty well here is the idea of moving on and what education means.In the story of Cars 3, McQueen gets into a terrible accident as the first turning point - one remembers that from the surreal teaser trailer where it made it look as though this might be the Saving Private Ryan of Cars movies or something - and though he wants to get back into racing there's constant trepidation, about his age, about his ability, about everyone else out on the track... and then comes, ironically enough, his trainer (thanks sponsor Fillion!), with a good voice job by Cristela Alonzo by the way, who of course didn't grow up as a, uh, small car wanting to become a trainer of other cars, she wanted to be race car herself! But she lacked the confidence and the wherewithal to keep at it (those who can't do teach sort of thing). Matter of fact, that may be the whole point of the movie, but it's also saying that isn't necessarily a bad thing - if you want it, it can be great.It reminds me too of what happens in other professions like in the movies where actors find they aren't getting the good roles or aren't being challenged enough so they decide to direct, and it takes on a whole new feeling and passion. All of this noted, Cars 3 doesn't exactly make this some big surprise, it's actually a predictable story that, at least for me and I'm sure many others, one will see coming a mile away as far as whether or not Lightning McQueen is going to do that first race (really the only question is how much or how little will he really race before passing on the baton). But Pixar was sneakily impressive here with how it brought real emotion, or as much as can happen with these cars, and Owen Wilson and Alonzo have a good pairing in the film that has an arc and develops over the course of the story.There's a little shakier ground that Pixar tip-toes up to as far as what it means to have, say, branding and merchandising - the Fillion ""Billionaire"" car Sterling (I wondered if he had ever wanted to race or as a tiny car wanted to be a, uh, Billionaire car, however they can spend it) looks at Lightning as a vehicle, no pun intended, for money-making, that his admiration for McQueen is for what he is *valued* as a commodity, as a presence or a thing, as opposed to his ability (which goes a way to explain why he's not impressed when he begs Sterling that he can do one more race). But I'm not sure Pixar developed that side of it enough, or perhaps they could only do so much satire in a G-rated movie for all audiences. It may be enough, though a little more could've gone a longer way to make a decent movie into one of their REALLY good sequels like Monsters U or Toy Story 3.At the end of it all though, Cars 3 is entertaining, occasionally quite funny (some puns and jokes hit better than others), and eschews typical villainy or the usual antagonists and embraces more like existential questions, which is probably more than a kid-friendly blockbuster like Cars 3 of all things had to concern itself with. I give Pixar points for that, and if seems like something that had... effort put into it, at least up to a point. Not to mention, last but not least, what seems to be a fitting coincidence (or it may be just what Lasseter intended) that a first-time director was promoted up to do this movie within Pixar, Brian Fee. It was time to get in the race, I suppose, and he showed up to do well."
63,Cars 3,4,29 July 2017,The car is a real boy,"I had a difficult time getting emotionally attached to the characters, something any good Pixar film would easily do. I'm guessing that it's probably because of the unwritten, but still unbroken social barrier between cars and humans, wherein I am unable to feel sympathy for a car. I was more emotionally affected by the animated short presented before the film, titled ""Lou"", in which the main character was an amalgamation of lost toys; to be fair, though, I did very much enjoy the short.As well, I felt the character of Cruz was created as a contrived social commentary on today's youth, those very much attached to technology, allegedly unable to handle the outside world as if they were trapped in the matrix or something. Her initial ineptitude at outdoor racing made me believe that she was written in by my self-righteous gramma."
64,Cars 3,5,22 July 2017,Just end it already.,"*Originally posted on TheLittleBinger.com* It's not over till it's over.Racing champion Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) returns in Cars 3 to continue racing. To his surprise, a new generation of racing cars starts to emerge making him the odd one out. He reaches the point where his racing colleagues start to retire and be replaced by newer and better models. Yet he insists on staying in the game. A bitter realization comes after getting into an accident during a race with the rookie-turned-rival, Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer). Soon after his rehabilitation in Radiator Springs and after getting some motivation from his friends, McQueen regained his confidence to continue racing.Out with the old, in with the new.He did this still with Rust-eze but under the management of Sterling (Nathan Fillon). Sterling promised him that he would soon be back on the racetracks but after undergoing rehabilitation. Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo) trained McQueen to be back in his old form and to even be better than he was before the crash.Lightning McQueen and Cruz Ramirez. Photo Credit: ""Disney-Pixar.""Cars 3 remains to be the odd one out in the entire Disney/Pixar line-up. While the better-known titles such Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Up pack great and engaging story lines, this franchise, however, has a huge contrast. It simply does not feel Pixar enough. Sure, Cars was a smart and moving title but the succeeding movies in the franchise simply felt unnecessary.Lightning McQueen 95. Photo Credit: ""Disney-Pixar.""Going metaOne can argue that the studio churns out sequels and even spin-off of the franchise because they sell. True enough but this latest installment gives off a vibe that it was made simply for that. The story is uninspired and unoriginal. It is not bad bad as Cars 2, though. Cars 3 tries to be inspirational and to remind everyone not to give up on their dreams. And succeed in it, it did. The film may not be memorable but it delivered a positive message especially to women that they can do what men do. Funny thing, though is that Cars 3 sounded meta with the team working on it trying to stay relevant. At the plot's core is knowing when to stop and it registered like the franchise saying it to the studio themselves."
65,Cars 3,6,3 July 2017,A giant mess of two story lines put into one movie.,"By the end of this movie, people will wonder why the rest of the movie even exists. The story and plot for the third movie in this series seems relatively unfinished, as if the story line should have been split into two different movies. The story doesn't know what it wants to be, and this becomes very apparent during the film's climax and resolution. The trailers for ""Cars 3"" showed that the story was going to take place much later in Lightning McQueen's career, and it does. One of the things this movie does really well is showing the passing of time with the idea that technology only becomes bigger, faster, and stronger than the past technological advances. Lightning McQueen was the best in his time, but now the future has caught up with him, making one of the fastest racers in this story line officially outdated. This, however, doesn't become the major plot when a new character is introduced; Cruz Ramirez.When this character comes into play, it's very visible to see that this is no longer Lightning McQueen's story, for she desperately wants to be one of the greatest racers of her time, just like Lightning McQueen was during his golden days. This shift in the story conflicts with the Lightning McQueen vs. Jackson Storm story plot, eventually making that rivalry completely pointless at the end of this film. Lightning McQueen steps down from his racing place and sets in Cruz to take his spot during the final race with Jackson Storm, which is where the movie falls flat on it's face. By erasing the rivalry between Lightning McQueen and Jackson Storm, the whole movie is basically rendered as pointless. There is no purpose for this film by having Cruz take up the mantle for Lightning McQueen, and as I said before, this is where the two story lines become one giant mess. Cruz beats Jackson Storm and Lightning McQueen is still allowed to coach Cruz into being a great racer.As for the characters in this movie, the original cast is not really near Lightning too much in this film, kind of rendering them to be pointless as well. They're there at some points, but not enough to make them important in any sort of way, which makes them a huge waste of screen time when they appear within a scene. Jackson isn't developed and is barely even in the movie at all except for the first race, parts where they mention him beating his old speed records, and also the final race at the end of the movie. The only characters that are a little bit more developed are Cruz and Lightning McQueen. Every other character is just shoehorned into the movie to advance through the story. Overall, this movie might be great for kids or it might put them to sleep. It's a 50/50 shot with this movie because it's not like the story was dragging, it just had uninteresting characters. As for the fans of the first Cars movie, they'll find that Cars 3 was better than the second entry, but nowhere near as good as the first one. Definitely save your money on this one and wait for the cheaper DVD release."
66,Cars 3,5,1 July 2017,Underwhelming disappointment.,"Let me just say this, I am NOT a huge fan of the sentient vehicle series. Cars 1 was fine, Cars 2 was borderline terrible, Planes was boring and Planes 2 was god awful. And while this movie is better than both Planes movies and Cars 2 to some extent, it still fails on many levels. I won't spoil anything but lets just say that even though it isn't boring, it is still a lousy movie and doesn't deserve the 7.2 out of 10 IMDb has given it. It didn't improve much over Cars 2. This was simply a waste of Pixar's time and money. I would've been OK with it if it was DisneyToon making it (they're the people responsible for Planes 1 and 2) because then I would have no reason to see it. But since Pixar made it I thought it would be something of decent quality. However it fails on many levels and I would not recommend it at all. If you like the sentient vehicle movie series regardless of quality then fine, see it. But be prepared for a movie that has no saving grace other than the fact that the animation is good. The animation is what earned this movie 4 stars in my book. That's the only thing good about it."
67,Cars 3,8,15 June 2017,Revving Up to A better Story,"""I am Speed!"" A quote that will live on forever in the minds of the 2000 generation, movie quote boards, and the status of Disney fans. For those not remembering the quote, or not realizing what this review is about, it is Lightning McQueen's catchphrase in the famous Cars series. Pixar's work about living Cars took the world by storm long ago, but a flat tire left it stranded behind its cousins. After a detour with the second installment, Cars 3 attempts to change tires and redeem itself on the winner circle. And it's my job to commentate and analyze the movie. Let's rev up and take off with another Robbie movie review. LIKES:Animation: Let's get the obvious out of the way, Pixar continues to prove they rock at making things move. Cars 3 is beautifully detailed, stylish, slick, and fluid on all levels from the skidding tires to simply drinking oil at a local garage bar. Unlike its sequels, the movie really focuses on the fast-paced world of racing, and brings the full effects of Disney animation to life. All the excitement is captivating and exciting, perfect for many audience members of all ages. And with all the new characters plenty of room for merchandising. Soundtrack: Most Disney fans often won't pay attention unless it is a flashy, over the top musical number famous from the renaissance of the 90s (and Frozen). Well although not the famous show stopping sequences, Cars 3 has a nice collaboration of song covers to classic songs that is sure to bring up some nostalgia. While not as good as the originals for me, I enjoyed most of the twists in this movie and felt they were appropriately placed in the film. Certainly, not the most unique soundtrack, but strong nonetheless. Comedy: Good news, Cars 3 is still funny, but even more importantly it doesn't rely on comedy as the only gimmick. Rather than relying on Mater's childlike innocence and stupidity, Cars 3 was able to bring some wit to the table and with it some dynamic comedy. Mater still has some quips to throw into the film, but the rest of the gang has some well-timed jabs that touch on a variety of topics and styles, which again, will hit most members of the audience. Story: The team must have taken a step back and analyzed the blue prints of their tale. Cars 3 story is miles above Car2, dropping into the character development and life lessons made famous in the first film. It is jam packed full of emotion, with gripping tales all coming together into a very compact package. With exciting races built into the story, the movie keeps a nice pace and remains fun to watch while also being educational. No convoluted tales of quirky action or stretches here folks, it's just classic country lifestyle. DISLIKES:Depressing: This really doesn't reveal anything, but much of this movie is quite depressing. While there is certainly a broad range of emotions ""racing"" through this film, I can say a good chunk is spent in the downer zone. While the kids will have a few moments that might upset them, adults are going to really take the blunt of the depression in this movie. The trailers have already hinted at the message, but they didn't prepare me for the intensity this movie has at times. Fortunately, they relieve that melancholy with fun moments, but somehow Pixar keeps that sullen moment in your mind. Old jokes: I told you they did a nice job balancing jokes, but I didn't say perfect, did I? Cars 3 gets a little obsessive with one joke category and starts to rely on it a little too much. These jokes at times is the perfect icing on the cake, but often it goes with that depressing component I told you about. I found the fun starting to leave and the sadness starting to set on way to go Pixar, depressing comedy. Still, your kids will laugh and might pick up a few annoying phrases to throw at you in the process. Characters dropped: Like many Disney films, the studios find a way to dump on the old to bring in the new. While certainly not the worst example of dropping characters, Cars 3 reduced many of your favorite character to background characters delivering somewhere between 1-5 lines. So those heavy on Mater, Sally, and the rest of the gang need to lower your expectations, and prepare to fall in love with the new guys on hand. This disproportion of characters is certainly sad to see, and while I do enjoy many of the new characters, you can't help but long to have the old and new world blend a little more together. The VERDICT:Cars 3 was certainly rebuilt from the wreckage of the last movie. The animation remains stunning, brought to full throttle with the exciting races thrown into the mix. Pixar makes the tale funny and with a much deeper, enriching story than number 2. Unfortunately for the audience above the age of 15, a somber mood hangs over much of this movie and it lacks a good balance of integrating old with the new. There are some other components I could comment on, but I'm out of room so you'll have to see for yourself. Nevertheless, Cars 3 is definitely worth a trip to the theater folks, and probably the leading blockbuster of this weekend's new releases. My scores:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"
68,Cars 3,2,3 December 2017,"Not as bad as Cars 2, but almost","This movie did everything to assassinate the things we loved about the original cars, and replaced it with some sort of your heroes aren't your heroes anymore baloney. Worse yet, some of the beloved characters are AWOL, only to be replaced with stale and one-dimensional characters. Essentially, the entire movie centers on one central idea, and nothing else. Unfortunately, that central idea is akin to telling the audience to end their admiration of the first movie and get ready for some sort of Cars 4 where the first movie is gone. It wasn't as bad as Cars 2, however, and it seemed to start out okay, but the story line was just pointless...unless the point was to prep you that the original Cars is dead. Yeah, we got the point. This movie either ensured that there will never be a Cars 4, or ensured that I won't go and take my kids to see a Cars 4."
69,Cars 3,5,8 November 2017,The Vidiot Reviews...,"Cars 3The upside to living in a world ruled by sentient vehicles is ample parking.Mind you, the articulate autos in this 3-D animated movie refer to parking spaces as condos.Weathered race veteran Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is sent to the scrap heap when tech-savvy newcomer Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer) joins the Piston Cup race circuit and bests all of his lap records.While he is on the mend Lightning takes his new trainer Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo) under his wing and, instead, helps her achieve her own racing aspirations; with a little help from a mysterious mechanic (Chris Cooper).Although the animation in this second sequel is superlative, its sad storyline spins its tires on long bouts of boring dialogue with high speed racing only bookending its PC narrative. Moreover, the voice work feels uninspired by the laugh-free script. Besides, even self-driving cars find NASCAR to be completely boring. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
70,Cars 3,1,4 November 2017,Pure feminist propaganda,"After 1 hour and 15 minutes, McQueen gives up and lets this girl racer with NO experience at ALL fill in for him.... she wins within 5 minutes. This whole thing was bullshit feminist propaganda. She and other female cars complain about not being able to race because they are female. 1st of all, that doesn't and would never happen nowadays and 2nd why bring sexism into a kids movie? Talk about politicizing a kids movie for a bullshit agenda. If lightning's trainer was a male, i can bet any money they would have just stuck with McQueen winning. But no, they made her female on purpose to make her represent women.And even if you ignore all the political bullshit, the movie was trash. This was no underdog story. Not when the underdog, Lightning McQueen dips out, putting all of his training to waste and someone else wins for him. That's over an hour of him training that you sat through for it all to go to waste. They could have showed the first race of the movie, McQueen crashing, then cut out all of the middle parts, McQueen retires, edit in a part of him meeting Cruz, then have McQueen train Cruz and make her the underdog, and then show the last race with her racing straight from the start. Boom! Better movie. And its instantly less propaganda if they make it that she just happens to be a huge racing fan who is waiting for her big shot, and McQueen helps her achieve that. And its a big bonus that he would intentionally help her beat the racer that beat him. He helps her achieve it in the movie itself, but by basically giving up and shifting the underdog title to her during the last 5-10 minutes of the movie. Like it was one giant accident. Absolute garbage. Terrible writing. Regardless on your opinion of the political side of this argument... you have to admit that if they wrote it the way I just suggested above, it would have been 10x better at least. A true underdog story closer to that of the first Cars movie, which was so far the only good one.To sum up, This why hate Disney movies, they like filling their animation movies dedicated to KIDS with things like politics and gender equality bullshit. Why can't Disney let a kids movie BE a kids movie?"
71,Cars 3,6,28 August 2017,"The Weakest Pixar Film to Date,","Cars 3 is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a great voice cast. It certainly has its moments, a pleasure as always to see these lovable characters once again, particularly Lightning McQueen and Mater, who have a terrific back and forth with one another as always. There is also a very sweet, hard hitting message as we see McQueen accepting his fate and realising it is his time to pass on the torch, the final fifteen minutes certainly serves as an effective finale to the series. I am somewhat heartbroken to be rating a Pixar film below an eight, but the quality of this film is far less than what I have come to expect from this studio. It is a very slow moving ninety minutes that I would imagine would get quite tedious for kids. It tries too hard to remain grounded, but is not gritty enough for that to be effective, it is far too innocent. It is also rarely funny, I am not saying this in a way that the jokes fall flat, but it actually does not try to be humorous for very long periods. It has a droll, bland tone throughout, an annoying new character and a very small amount of screen time from all the characters who made the original two harmless fun, bar Lightning. Expected much more from my favourite animation studio. A disappointing conclusion to an enjoyable series, Cars 3 is nothing more than a movie made for merchandising, the kids may love it, but there is very little here for adults. Lightning McQueen struggles to keep up with a new generation of racers and technology."
72,Cars 3,1,15 November 2017,What a huge turnoff. The hero became a quitter because of PC,"IMDB is my source of movie infos for over 20 years. I've never made single comment on movies here. This crap had me making the first one.As for a kid's movie, it is a good way to teach how to give up. Hey, if you feel you're not up to the task, instead of trying harder, step aside and let other people do the job for you. Then surf on their success. Everyone is a cute and special snowflake and even if it wasn't you to do the hard work, you still get a medal anway...Way to go Disney/Pixar. Hard work probably never payed up at all;.. Oh wait!...Kids have to see hero movies to get inspired. where the good guy is the underdog and accomplish his things through hardwork. The hero wins in the end, because he is tough.The hero doesn't give up. The hero doesn't keep his head down. Disney people would learn a bunch watching Dragonball.The movie had potential. Gave 1 star because it wasn´t possible go negative."
73,Cars 3,,17 June 2017,Lightning McQueen gets neutered,"I hate to hate on this movie I really do, but it just misses in so many places. I'll only mention a few. This review will have spoilers! Lightning McQueen was an awesome confident character , now he's only a shell of himself. it's not even the same character anymore. It makes it out to be a good thing - and he is nicer, but evidently that means you can't be competitive and you must give up... Also, I'm kinda tired of every Disney movie feeling the need to push feminist propaganda - and if you miss this in the movie - well, tell me your trick - I'd love to know how you do it. And finally BIG SPOILER HERE: the ending is completely stupid - he doesn't even finish the race - he stops midway through and lets the young female protégé finish for him - yes you know, the one who was always told she couldn't do it and that she wasn't allowed in the race - Blah...blah...blah.... IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STINKIN RACE! This is a movie for kids that decided to tackle the issues of ageing and sexism.... I just want to take my kids to a movie that is for kids."
74,Cars 3,10,15 July 2017,Very good movie.,"The movie in general was a great movie, it had a great story line and a great ending. I love the fact how they brought back the old memories of Doc Hudson in the movie, it was like the story was really based around him! The movie ended perfectly when lightning came in the pits and switched with Cruiz to give her the chance that she always wanted. It ended perfectly, I would 100% give this movie a 10 and in my opinion is the best out of all 3."
75,Cars 3,10,14 July 2017,I don't get why everybody hates this..?,"I was quite excited for this film. This film had a lot of expectations to live up to so the pressure was kind of high for the makers. But honestly, I think they nailed it. *SPOILER*I really love how this movie links to Cars 1 (in contrast to Cars 2). Cars 1 was probably my youth (now I'm 14) so I really loved that!The story is great. The older ones (McQueen and his friends) are getting blown away by new racers, so he has to make a comeback, yes. And that's where everybody gets to hate McQueen. I think the decision of McQueen becoming coach was a great idea. Well, actually he said he continued racing or I took that the wrong way, but anyway, it's good to encourage hard decision you have to make. That's what this movie was all about in my perspective.I loved this and I was completely blown away by the final scenes but it was amazing! All the memories!"
76,Cars 3,6,21 June 2017,"Cars 3 (2/3 great, 1/3 complete franchise destroyer)","Overall this movie was, to be honest, I don't even know how to describe it. If I could remove the ending of this film I would give cars 3, 8 to 10 stars but, sadly you can't do that. The movie does a great job setting up this underdog story where lighting must overcome incredible odds or his career as a racer is over. I like how in the movie lighting tries to improve his chances first by technology but when that doesn't work, he goes back to what helped him in the first movie, DOC. The movie does a great job with these two acts but the third one completely sh**s on itself. Lighting, from the very beginning of this film has been fighting left and right to keep his career as a racer. He says multiple times how racing isn't about money, or stuff, its about the thrill, its about going 200 mph, its about the fun, and its about the love for the sport, and this is why he will never stop. He trains and learns all he can for the big race at the end of the movie and then, wait for it, he....... QUITS so some another car (Cruz) can have her chance as a racer, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. Okay, I get why lighting did it, the movie was slowly telling us about Cruz and how she wants to be a racer so badly but no one takes her seriously, and shes too scared to do it by herself, but after a road trip with lighting, lighting sees her for who she truly is, a racer. Now this would make a good story, if Cars 3 actually focused on this from the very beginning instead of focusing and marketing on a comeback story, only to be replaced right at the end by a completely different story. The way they did it in the film was forced, sloppy, and just plain bad. The movie gave about 10 mins for this new story about Cruz, 10 MINSSSSS. In the trailers and for about 90% of Cars 3, the story is about lighting and his struggle to get back to the top even though everyone is telling him to quit. He does this because he loves to race and doesn't want to stop. That was the main focus of the majority of the film. However at the end, after lighting tapped into Doc's legacy, learned new tricks and trained very hard, the story changes to lighting training a car who wants to be a racer, LITERALLY DURING THE LAST RACE. Thats how rushed and bad it is. If they kept lighting in this race, made him win and then start teaching cruz (making her like the new lighting and making lighting like the new doc), that would of been great, but nope. To sum it up, Cars 3, to be honest, left me sad, deprived, unsatisfied, confused and kind of angry. For me, Cars 3 hasn't ended yet. Its like the first 2 acts in Cars 3 were slammed together with the last part of Cars 4. I don't know why they did what they did in the last act but it ruined the movie, left the whole comeback story hanging and made lighting quit racing, even though he would never do that. I would recommend watching this movie and then turning it off when lighting makes his first pit stop in the final race, and just imagine that lighting won using the new skills, and tricks he learned from the masters.********************************************************************* editttt (After Watching it for the second time) *********************************************************************So after writing this review, I was wondering if I missed anything hinting, or leaning to the final act where Cruz becomes a champion. So I decided to watch it again. Going through the movie again, I noticed two things. The big one was when Lighting realized that the best part of Doc's life was teaching Lighting, not racing himself. Making Lighting realize that He doesn't need to race to keep on racing, he can pass the torch to someone else and still get the joy of racing, if not more. As I said above, the whole Cruz story makes sense and I get it but, I still don't like how Lighting dropped out of the biggest race of his career. This is because the second thing I noticed. Lighting said he isn't done racing. So why would he give up that raceee. What they should of done was allowed lighting to win or lose (I have some cool ideas for him losing) and after Lighting shows that he is the best, or some other message, then he trains Cruz on how to go against these new gen racers, and soon racing isn't just about tech anyone, its about heart and the will to win."
77,Cars 3,5,22 October 2017,Feminism Propaganda tha Destroys the Legacy of Lighning,"This was made with feminism in mind. I assume these movie in 2016-2017 were so far in production, they were already enthralled in the feminist agenda, and had Hillary Clinton invested in their movies and wanted to push that agenda.Sad how this series shows the state of progressive Hollywood, but it was a decent movie but pushed identity politics.Essentially Lightning is now the old racer, being replaced by the modern generation and meets a young female race car, who is just as good as the male racers, but misogyny and lack of belief in herself is the ONLY reason she never races.If you can stomach the feminism and the overtones, it's not that bad. But this movie is not subtle in its message, women can be as good as men, gender is a construct and virtue signal and men are bad.5 out of 10, if you can stomach the feminism."
78,Cars 3,6,25 July 2017,First is almost always the best...,"I expected more from this movie. Much more.... The first one, almost 11 years ago, was soooooo good! A lot of fun, with really inspired and lovable characters: Mater (almost everybody's most beloved character), Luigi, Guido, Doc, Ramone, even Sally and yes (why not?), even Lightning McQueen! You felt like you've got in a so coherent and real universe of humanized cars. Very humanized and with simple and believable stories. The entire movie was simple but well cooked, with an incredible sense of humor, with good, decent and tasty jokes ... and therefore beautiful! I just loved it! Have I talked about Cars so far? I guess that's because there's not much to say about Cars 3, unfortunately. It's not awful but you don't remain with too much after the movie ends. The whole silly gang from Radiator Spring is reduced to Luigi and Guido, the rest having almost no importance in this movie. The new characters are just some clones of the oldest, so why you would make a new movie where you try to copy yourself? Smokey, for instance, is just a new but much weaker Doc Hudson, with nothing special to transmit to the audience. Jackson Storm it's some sort of sci-fi shadow of Chick Hicks and I had to look on the cast list to remember the name of the character, seeing the movie just two hours ago. Cruz is a wannabe-ish McQueen with little force to convince and I guess it could be an important character for an allegedly Cars 4 sequel. And, of course, it's about a race at the end of the movie. I'm so sad! Cars 3 is a story put on four animated wheels instead of two living feet that you saw in a thousand of other movies, comedies or dramas, nothing original. If you're a fan of Cars franchise, watch it! If you're not, don't...! Start with the first installment of Cars and if you don't like it, stop there! In the memory of Mater, Luigi, Guido, Doc, Ramone, Sally, Sheriff, Lizzie, I give a 6 out of 10. Just as Cars, in my opinion, would deserve a higher than 7.1 grade (as it has now), Cars 3 deserves no more than 5, but I couldn't stand to see a sad face of Mater! :-)"
79,Cars 3,10,16 June 2017,"Kids should go to this movie, parents MUST see this movie","Apart from pain in the neck because of the bad seat I ended up -far left of the first raw which is about 5 meters from the screen- everything was truly amazing.Great visuals, which is really kind of the standard of what to expect to see when a PIXAR movie so no surprises there. Well executed light hummer that suits a very wide range of age groups and genders.Kids will like the movie for sure, but most parents -especially approaching or past 40's- will fall in love with it. For a 41 old father at what I think is the peak of my career, this movie echoed on so many levels that I a tear or 2 have escaped involuntary.I got to watch it with a group of parents & kids and was happy to see all were really touched & moved by the depth of the script. Will give it another go soon -yest it is that good- from a good seat."
80,Cars 3,10,20 June 2017,Thank you Pixar! All aboard the feels train!!!,"Cars 3 was just magical, I cannot express how fabulous it is. I remember the first time I saw Cars, alAnd my words aren't even doing justice to it! Really! So if you haven't seen it, just go see it!! Pixar isn't just for kids. But we're all kids at heart anyway. I don't mean to sound like a broken record but it appears that Disney allied with Pixar can achieve greatness in making a perfect memorable film. Cars 3 brings back our favorite characters in this darker, suspenseful sequel but unlike Cars 2, this doesn't involve secret agent saving the day stuff, it's solely focused on Lightning McQueen and his fate in the racing industry. Disney/Pixar surely raised the bar with Cars 3, not only is this film amazing, but it's packed with thrilling action and also some of the strongest characters just like in the first Cars movie.McQueen returns as an experienced older racer who's struggling to keep up with the newer generation cars with high end technology. Racing enthusiasts and sponsors have outgrown McQueen's generation of race cars and have moved on to the futuristic racers equipped with state of the art mechanisms who train in super cool simulators. After losing to Jackson Storm, a rival racecar who replaced McQueen as the Piston cup champion. This race left McQueen broken with no hope in the racing industry. Then one thing leads to another and he end up at Rusteze training center, where McQueen is introduced to the new owner and the futuristic training equipment. He tries doing everything his new trainer Cruz says but the new training exercises didn't bode well not did he show any improvement. Believing that he no longer is a champion he once was, he heads out to meet Smokey and seek his help if he were to beat Storm the old way.McQueen and Cruz unwillingly enter a local street-racing competition on his way, he finds himself back on the road with Mack, he learns that Cruz was once an aspiring racer but was made to settle for training new racers. After a series of events and some rigorous training exercises with the old racers with Smokey, McQueen is back in Florida, motivated and ready to take on his rival. However he is convinced that he can never be as fast as Storm and chanting his motivational mantra that goes like ""Speed. Faster than fast, quicker than quick. I am Lightning. Speed. I am Speed. Okay, here we go. Focus. Speed. I am speed."" doesn't make him go any faster. So now with laps running short, McQueen convinces his trainer Cruz to take his position while he takes the comm at their pit crew. By doing this, Lightning McQueen has accepted his place in the racing industry and he helps Cruz win the cup. In the closing scene, we learn that Dinoco (an oil company and the sponsor of Strip Weathers aka The King) has brought Rusteze and is now an official sponsor for Cruz while McQueen retires to becoming the brand ambassador of Rusteze Products while mentoring his new student Cruz. This scene is one of the things that I absolutely loved about this film it was a bittersweet ending (hopefully not, in fact I'd love another sequel) to McQueen's racing career. Cars 3 has some genuinely chilling moments, like the crash scene that changed the fate of McQueen forever. I loved when McQueen got a newer paintjob as a tribute to his role model and the ex-racing icon, Doc Hudson. It was just beautiful how history repeated for him. McQueen sees himself doing the same thing that Hudson did after his days on the racetrack. This was a terrific film that I was glad to see. I can't wait to add this movie to my collection. So far, this is the best film I've seen in 2017. 10/10"
81,Cars 3,10,28 June 2017,One of the best comebacks of a franchise I've ever seen,"This film is absolutely awesome in almost every way. It is a monumental comeback from the semi disappointing Cars 2, which was still awesome, but still a complete letdown from the 1st film. This film, once again, has got the charm and great premise that the 1st film had, and this film goes on a great flow. The story was poignant, well written, and as I said, on a great flow. The CGI is absolutely amazing and well detailed as well, as the cars themselves and the landscapes looked fantastic and almost lifelike. I think this is one of the most impressive sequels I've ever seen, especially from a film like Cars 2. I was scared that this film was going to be even worse, but this film pleasantly shocked me, as it's actually almost, if not just as good as the first one. This film seems like everything Cars 2 should've been, and I recommend to any fans of the Cars franchise who has not seen this film yet, because even if there's anyone that is still hesitant on seeing another Cars movie after seeing Cars 2, I can almost guarantee they'll feel right at home with this film, as it has the charm and good premise that the first film had. I couldn't be happier with how this film turned out, and if there's ever a Cars 4, I'll be excited to see that as this 2nd sequel proves that Pixar is improving the Cars franchise. And they're doing it well."
82,Cars 3,8,9 September 2017,Finally has that Pixar magic which has been missing from this franchise,"I'm not a huge fan of the Cars franchises, even though I might one of its soul defenders because I actually really enjoyed the first cars movie which I thought had a good message of slowing down and enjoying life, not just speeding by missing out on what life has to offer. Cars 2 however was probably the worst Pixar movie ever made, so I was none too pleased when I heard they were making a Cars 3. It all changed when we all saw the teaser trailer however (which was very dark) and I found out that they have a new writing team and producer for this one. So I was open-minded when I walked into Cars 3, hoping for something good. I have to be honest, I really liked it a lot. It's a Cars film with Pixar level story telling which is something we have not seen in any of the Cars films so far, including the first one. As much as I liked the first one though, it does lack a bit on Pixar level story telling. What I mean by this is that the movie (Cars 3) had some emotional moments, characters who are supposed to be there for the fun of it didn't outstay their welcome, and the movie was generally fun and pleasing. I say give Cars 3 a watch for enjoyment and amusement."
83,Cars 3,9,25 June 2017,Sweet Childhood Memories,"Pixar's awe-inspiring world with beautiful story telling continues on with Cars 3. Not only targeting children of all ages but having some motivational messages spread throughout the movie. Ending the beautiful trilogy, taking what was good from the original one that we all loved and adored."
84,Cars 3,5,26 June 2017,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"Jay And Nick both enjoyed the first Cars Movie. It was not Pixar's best work, but it was still enjoyable. The second one was horrible. It was pointless and there was just no reason for it to be made. This one, however...while it's better than the 2nd Movie it's still not as good as the first. It leaves off where the 2nd one left off...Lightning Mcqueen is still in action and is still stronger and faster than ever...until the day someone by the name of Jackson Storm (voiced by Armie Hammer) turns up and is beating Mcqueen at every race and every step of the way! Mcqueen needs to train harder if he is to beat Storm, and it wont be as simple as he thought! All the characters were good, mostly the new ones. Don't go in expecting for all he old characters like Mater (Larry The Cable Guy) to be in it much. Mater and all the other characters were only in it for 8 mins! That's not to say that all the new characters are bad, they are actually likable and pretty good. The problem with the film is it's not paced well enough for kids and it's not quite likable enough for adults, so it's a tricky movie to rate. The movie is decent at every second that clicks, and it never really gives you anything emotional like so many other Pixar Movies do, but it's probably worth a rent. Only go to see this if you have nothing better to do or you just want to kill 100 minutes. Could have been so much more! 2.5/5 stars- Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers."
85,Cars 3,9,19 July 2017,While Not The Best Pixar Film It Did However Become The Best One In The Franchise,"When It comes to the Cars franchise, these films aren't week received and people say It's their worst film, to me I did love these films when I was young, to this day I still like the first movie, sure It has problems like how the world was created and It's predictable, but It doesn't turn It In a bad movie, I didn't take everything around the film seriously like how cars are now people, how they eat and jokes/Visual gags all that stuff, I seen films where I don't ask questions and I just enjoy the ride.Now the first Cars I thought was a re latable and relaxing movie, Cars 2 Is just okay.. but the worst Pixar film I seen, It does have cool action scenes and fantastic animation as always, but It felt like something out of Dreamworks, BlueSky or Illumination, It's a disappointment coming from a wonderful Animation studio.BUT! they seem to have take the hate from Cars 2 and made a new teaser for Cars 3 and saying ""Well If you don't like Cars 2, how would you like It If you saw the main character getting destroyed and getting torn and really dark, now you'll want to see Cars 3 now"", well from the rest of trailers they do seem to take a more serious tone with the new one but still being a comedy at the same time, I was pretty worried at the point but excited because Cars was a good childhood movie.I went to see It on Wedensday the 19th of July In a nearly empty cinema since I did see It on a weekday and let me tell you how Pixar completely outdone themselves with this one, It's everything I wanted Cars 3 to be, not any spy stuff like Cars 2, but more like what the first Cars was, racing, the plot Is executed fantastically while all that original at all but It does It's job very well.Most of the characters I ended up like the remaking ones like Lighting McQueen and yes I still find Mater funny, but for the new ones the only one I ended up liking Is Cruz who Is like the Inscure trainer for McQueen but It does turn around as the film goes on, I won't give It away but I ended up relating to the characters, others like Jackson Storm, Sterling, Miss. Fritter and Smokey are just basic characters that you'll except them to be, although I like Smokey out of the rest, besides Cruz, but Jackson Storm ended up as a generic villain which was disappointing because I wanted to like the villain because he did look cool.The animation coming from Pixar Is still top notch giving us well crafted car designs, beautiful and realistic backgrounds and really great racing scenes, so not much to say but still remains fantastic for Pixar.The score composer once again by the Randy Newman like the first movie and while the film does reuse some of the music from the first movie and at the moments where It's expected, but what he did here Is still great as usually, while sounding a little whimsy, It can be beautiful to listen to, even some of the song choices are really good as well.I do have one minor issue and that Is the film can be repeatable from the first movie making It a bit predictable, but at least they are respecting the first movie and the late Paul Newman.So overall, Cars 3 Is one of the most pleasantly surprising films of the summer and this year, another well-crafted sequel from Pixar, while not as well written as Finding Dory and Toy Story 2 and 3, but It did everything that I liked about the first Cars, this Is a must watch for Pixar/Cars fans, It's my favorite In the franchise, I'm happy for Pixar to return to the first movie and make It even, so for that I say thank you Pixar for doing the right thing and sticking to It and I can't wait to see Coco when It comes out.... In 2018...I'm going to give Cars 3 a nice 9.9/10."
86,Cars 3,6,31 December 2017,not what i expected but with some good surprises,First of all i want to say that i am not a fan of cars but I'd like to see how this trilogy will end so i watch it. So i start the movie and i realize that the plot was expected to be easy to understand and with no surprises but at the end of the movie the hole thing change and give a interest in the movie.This change it was not exactly what you expected to see as this is the last adventure of mcqueen. I like the feeling of regardness and love that the last minutes offering to the audience but i expected an amazing end of the mcqueen carreer that i didnt see.
87,Cars 3,10,21 June 2017,"McQueen suffers a crash and has to get through an era of Next-Gen racers. He trains with Cruz Ramirez, so he can get back into the sport.","What can I say but excellent, incredible, brilliant, the real Cars 2 (cars 2 wasn't bad, but, it wasn't really the thing I expected...) This movie was so great that I went to Target and bought some Mattel die-casts after the movie. Board up my doors and windows before I spend all of my money on tickets to see it again. My whole family cried, because when my brother and I were very young, Cars was a huge part of our lives. Well, I guess DisneyPixar in general as well. For all the people who rated 1/10, it may be their opinion, but I think Cruz was hilarious, McQueen was powerful, Mater held the right lever of ""protagonist"" in this movie, and they payed true tribute to the late Paul Newman."
88,Cars 3,7,19 June 2017,Visual treat for Kids,"Pixar has changed the way animation movies are received. They have excelled in catching audience's minds through Toy Story, Wall-E, The Incredibles and Inside out. Cars were not probably the one among them.The franchise has lagged when Cars 2 hit the screens. But, Cars 3 has changed the course of the franchise. Though the story is not new, the way it unfolds keep the audience engaged, especially the last half an hour.If you liked Cars 1 then Cars 3 will make you love the franchise (Cars 2 might not). The characterization was near perfect. The voices of Owen Wilson as McQueen and Cristela Alonzo as Cruz Ramirez add the charm to the movie.Visually the movie is as good as every Pixar movies. Kids will celebrate the movie for sure. A worthy watch if you like animation movies. A must watch if you love the Cars franchise."
89,Cars 3,9,26 June 2017,Ignore the haters,"Cars 3 is a good movie. It is not a waste of money. Its funny, sweet and entertaining. The visual experience is amazing.I don't personally understand what it is that can cause people to hate on a kid's movie so much. Some of the reviews left make no sense and are just bitter and cruel. Seems a lot of people these days think they are better story tellers than those who make a living from it. Gone are the days of going to see a movie and enjoying the experience, at least for a large percentage of people using this site. They go to judge every scene and tear it apart and go home and write up a scathing review. Sad. Perhaps Disney doesn't have an agenda to denigrate and stereotype all people and things. Perhaps they just wanted to tell a story that reflected real life situations. Both of my sons love Cars. We have been watching the two movies and all of the shorts, for the last ten years. We all loved Cars 3. Having Lightning retire was not a tragedy for us. Things do change over time, that's real life. Lightning passing on the baton so to speak, to a female car was not a problem. Turns out that women like to race cars too so why shouldn't we see a female race car? Also realistically women find it harder to make a name for themselves in some sports. All of the topics touched on in the movie made sense to me. My kids were not upset, they didn't question or complain about the story line. It was not killing off Lightning or emasculating him or whatever other drivel has been written on reviews here. As for anyone who can't connect to a character while watching a movie, be that character a talking car, real person or a singing sofa, that's a problem with yourself. It's not the story telling of the movie. There were plenty of emotional moments and plenty of funny moments as well.If I had one complaint it was that Jackson Storm was too one dimensional. As an antagonist he lacked the fun and spark of Chick Hicks in the first movie. It felt Armie Hammer was wasted, which was a shame. You can't love everything about a movie though. I've yet to see a movie that I thought was perfect.As someone who has been immersed in the Cars culture for the last decade and knows the characters well, and as a 37 year old mother of six, I really liked Cars 3. I have no issue with any of the topics in the movie. We all enjoyed it for what it was, the continuing story of Lightning McQueen. I thought it was equally as good as the first movie, in its own way. It was nicely done, clever and well worth watching. Go see it with the intent to enjoy, not judge and I'm sure you will have a good time!"
90,Cars 3,9,23 June 2017,Please make 4th part,"I am huge fan of cars movies but this one disappointed me please make its 4th part any show Lightning McQueen is back with his new look & skills because kids and children want to watch it.Pleaase Pixar Animation Studios & Walt Disney Pictures make a new part for kids,children and cars movie fans."
91,Cars 3,5,24 June 2017,Pleasant roads ahead! Not as bad as you might expect,"I've never been a fan of the ""Cars"" franchise, but I was curious about this one. The first trailers seemed to indicate they were going for something far more serious and visceral. Turns out that most of the marketing was a bit of a lie. It's not the change of tone I was hoping, although it's not as bad as you might expect.Imagine ""Rocky"" meets ""Cars"". That's pretty much the story here. I noticed that the filmmakers did step up their effort in making the plot more serious and grounded. It still feels like a standard film in this series just a bit more down to earth. I appreciate that some care was put into it rather than it mainly being a vessel to sell more toys. The shame is that the first half is somewhat slow with little humor. I feel like Pixar found it difficult to decide whether it's gonna be more of a fun movie or a dramatic one. Because the idea of Lightning McQueen facing retirement sounds like it would be hard-hitting. We are talking about the tone you'd see in Pixar's ""Up"". I think it would have been a great idea to mainly stick to a dramatic story and leave the jokes out for this round. The problem is that it lacked energy and a personality. Sometimes it's better to take a risk than playing it safe. And they followed the latter here. We get introduced to a premise that has potential to step up an entire franchise, but instead we have a studio who fears to fully commit and stays on the simple road. It's pretty much every ""Cars"" film you've seen before, but with serious themes wanting to burst out of this generic result.The animation is fantastic. It's unbelievable how far CGI has gone. The main characters are alright. Owen Wilson and Cristela Alonzo do their absolute best with their voice performances. More than what the movie deserves. I have to applaud them for their commitment here because we do get a few dramatic scenes and the voice acting was on point there. Overall we get like- able characters in a lack-luster story that follows the same routes we've seen before in underdog Sport films. It's a harmless experience with a pleasant vibe. Watch it if you have kids who adore cars or Pixar. It's still miles ahead of ""Cars 2"", but unfortunately that isn't saying much."
92,Cars 3,8,20 June 2017,10x better than the 1st and 100x better then the second!,"When I was a kid I was a huge fan of the cars movie. Unfortunately, then came the second one. For the last three months I have been anticipating this movie but was also worried about it. I can tell you now this is one of the best Pixar animations I have ever seen. I am not just saying this out of my own perspective. This movie contains humor, stellar animation, a very good story that will get the viewer's attention and suitable content. Pixar has done it once again and also took feedback from the second movie's review. Take that, Planes: Fire and Rescue. If you are older than 18 you will still love this action packed fun comedic and emotionally entertaining film. See it!"
93,Cars 3,10,18 July 2017,Amazing!!!,"As a Pixar fan, I think Pixar did an amazing job on this movie. The movie has great graphics, they gave a good message, and it actually relates to the racing concept. It's definitely worth your time and money, and both kids and adults will love it. I personally LOVED it myself, and I think Cruz Ramirez will be a role model to a lot of women and girls."
94,Cars 3,10,9 July 2017,"Great for fans of trilogy, Great for newcomers","Cars 3 is really impressive Disney movie with great animation and beautiful story.Good+: Actors,animation,music,story. Bad:Characters background story (CRUZ),running time must be a little bit longer.This is definitely amazing animated movie. You must watch it a few times for complete picture.ENJOY!!!"
95,Cars 3,6,19 June 2017,Thoroughly meh,"Want to go see a movie with a theater full of kids who are bored after 15 minutes of a movie? Well here's your flick. The first half of this movie are BORING. Almost every kid in the theater was stir crazy from lack of humor, or any real story. It picks up a bit by 3/4 in, but doesn't make up for the first half being flat out mediocre. Overall not terrible like Cars 2, but geez is this one ever keeping in the vein of the Cars franchise quality wise."
96,Cars 3,8,19 June 2017,Not a bad ride.,"So after the lackluster sequel that was Cars 2, Cars 3 redeems itself. Coming full circle, the story revolves around Lighting McQueen in a classic story about an old athlete having to compete with new blood and making the decision about weather he's a seasoned racer or just over the hill.Helping him make this decision is his new trainer name Cruz Ramirez (cool pun name) a kid trying to get an old car to train like the newer models.Other new characters include Jackson Storm who is the newer faster model of car that Lighting has to compete with. The movie has a well done message on sportsmanship, which almost got lost on me because from a technology standpoint, the type of car Lighting is can't beat the type of car Jackson is.It's been a while since I scene the original Cars, can't remember how much I liked it. I do remember hating Cars 2, which made the mistake of counting on Larry the Cable Guy's star power. Cars 3 is cool, not exactly the awesomeness that I expect from Pixar. It does not have the magic like Toy Story, but it's still a great flickGood to watch if you love cars in general especially.http://cinemagardens.com"
97,Cars 3,9,25 July 2017,"These ""1 Star"" Reviews Don't Know The True Spirit of Cars","After seeing this film with my two siblings, we claimed that it was well worth our time and agreed that it was better than both of the two previous Cars installments. When I returned to IMDb, I felt that this film was being robbed with the stream of over-exaggerated 1 star reviews that I saw.I feel that I should probably tidy up the situation here.The main reason for all of the hate towards this film is directed towards the final race; instead of finishing the race alone, Lightning McQueen allows his former trainer, Cruz Ramirez, to finally have her ""first race"" by letting her complete and win the last half for him. Admittedly, I was quite surprised at this ending myself, but I feel that giving the whole film ""1 star"" without regarding the rest of the film, which is excellent, is kind of immature. This is deliberate so that Cruz can finally see herself as a ""racer"" and not a ""trainer"", linking to her dream from halfway in the film. Furthermore, if you look at the alternative, I don't think it would have been much better: If Lightning McQueen completed the whole race and beat ""Jackson Storm"", despite the fact that not even a day before the race he was nowhere near reaching his speeds. This would have made the ending unrealistic and confusing.As for the rest of the film, I thought it was almost perfectly done. I am so thankful that the director decided to implement references from the original Cars instead of trying to continue from the less successful Cars 2, which was a bit of a spin off from the original. For example, Lightning McQueen's opening monologue is repeated: ""I Am Speed"". Parts like these added a real touch which my siblings and I relate to well.In conclusion, Cars 3 has really put the heart and soul of the original Cars film back in action, with good humour, such as Mater, a good plot and memorable characters. I believe this 1 star reviews are over dramatic- if you have seen the original Cars, this film will be enjoyable for you."
98,Cars 3,6,26 June 2017,Strangely... Not really for kids,"Cars 3 was pitched as the comeback for the Cars franchise. After the complete disaster of a movie the second one was, this was supposed to be a ""back to basics"" sequel to get movie goers back into the seats and liking Lightning McQueen and the gang all over again and reminding you how good the first one was. But if you are taking your kids, it's a complete misfire. Even my 5 year-old leaned over and asked me if I was enjoying the movie. When I said yes, he said, ""Good. This movie is for you -- It's not for me."" And he was absolutely right.The premise of the story is about how some people deal with the fact that you are getting older and need to step aside, pass the torch and mentor the younger generation to be better than yours' was. That is a concept COMPLETELY over the heads of any kids in any animated movie audience. Mine didn't get it and didn't care. Neither will yours. He was bored within 30 minutes. We stayed to the end because I wanted to see the rest of it. He could've cared less.Anything that makes millions these days is just done to death. This is another example. Cars are on everything. There was no need for it and the Cars franchise certainly didn't redeem itself. It was an OK film for adults. Not many kids are going to leave the theater talking about it or rushing out to buy the toys."
99,Cars 3,6,22 June 2017,"From the Studio that brings You Originality, Comes a Complete Lack!","Let's be perfectly frank here. Pixar is one of those companies that is known for making high quality children's film. ""WALL-E"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Up"", the Toy Story trilogy are all classics made by this studio. Cars is easily their least loved franchise. Yet it is the second franchise to get a full trilogy. So, why does Pixar spend time and energy producing these films that have little to no artistic merit. The answer is to sell toys. The Cars franchise has no reason to exist other than to sell the dozens of toy cars that are created with each movie's release.So, now that we've established that Cars is nothing more than Pixar selling out, does that mean the movies necessarily suck? Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe are beloved franchises and both very clearly sold out. So selling out doesn't automatically equate to bad. The question perhaps should be, why isn't the Cars franchise as beloved as Star Wars or the MCU or even almost every other Pixar movie? That answer is nuanced. Well, it's more nuanced with Cars 1 and 3. Cars 2 does just flat out suck.The original ""Cars"" was a very traditional fish-out-of-water movie that is almost a beat-for-beat remake of ""Doc Hollywood"". Perhaps Pixar was gambling that people wouldn't remember a middling Michael J Fox movie from the early 90s? ""Cars 2"" was a mistaken identity spy comedy probably drawing on films like ""The Man Who Knew Too Little"" and 1967's ""Casino Royale"". And Cars 3 is essentially the first half of ""Rocky III"" attached to the end of ""Creed"". This is almost certainly why the Cars franchise is nothing special. Essentially, it just lift ideas from other movies and replaces the human characters with cars and somehow expects that will be enough to thrill people. It doesn't.Also, Mater is without a doubt the worst and perhaps one of the most unfunny comedic relief characters ever created. Thankfully, his role is reduced this time around, but not nearly enough for my taste.That's not to say these movies are completely awful (except Cars 2). Cars 3 actually has a very strong first act and a third act that is solid enough. Unfortunately, the second act slowly gets more and more boring until it jumps back to life at the end. Both Cars and Cars 3 have a lot of charm and many young children will enjoy these movies for what they are. However, as long as they continue to never ever bring anything new to the table they will never be as good some of the best Pixar has to offer."
100,Cars 3,9,9 November 2017,Passing The Torch,"Believe it or not it's been 11 years since the story of a hot shot young racing car named Lightning McQueen first enchanted young viewers with his story of learning there is more to life than just being the top car. That story talked about learning what it was to have deep rooted friends and family. Here we are all those years later and the third movie in the series is out on disc. What makes it special is that time has passed in the story as well.McQueen (Owen Wilson) is still the hot shot race car he always was, still living in his adopted town of Radiator Springs and still friends with those he considers family there. But times have changed and he's gotten older. A new breed of race car is on the tracks now, in particular an up and comer named Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer). The new cars are faster, train differently and are soon leaving McQueen in their dust. In an attempt to push past them he crashes.Months pass and McQueen isn't sure he wants to return to the track. It takes his friend Sally (Bonnie Hunt) to convince him this is what he truly wants. He heads back to Rust-ESE to get back in shape only to find his old friends Luigi and Guido have sold the business to tycoon Sterling (Nathan Fillion). Sterling has it in mind to market McQueen for all he can, endorsing nearly every possibility out there. To insure that he returns to the winner's circle he's employing the latest in technology and a trainer by the name of Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo).McQueen does his best with the new system but this isn't his style of training. After a crash on the simulator he realizes he needs to get back to his roots and heads for the beaches of Florida. Accompanying him is some old friends as well as Cruz. When they begin he spends more time teaching Cruz more than he getting himself ready. Unable to break the speed set by Jackson Storm he begins to give up hope until he thinks of one more possibility.He goes to where it all began, where his mentor Doc was taught. There he finds Doc's mentor Smokey (Chris Cooper) still alive along with several of Doc's old friends. They've been expecting him and training in their fashion begins. But will it be enough for him to get back what he once had? SPOILER ALERT! And here is where the entire film takes a different turn. When the big race comes in the fourth quarter of the film, McQueen bows out and allows Cruz to take his place. And this is what the real story of CARS 3 is all about, the passing of the torch from the older generation to the younger, giving the new comer the chance to bask in the same glory they once enjoyed.Watching this I was reminded of the ROCKY films. The time had come for Stallone as Rocky to take off the gloves and start helping pass the torch, which he did. This film is doing the same thing and in doing so sets itself up for more movies down the line. Rather than deal with the question of an aging car still winning races against all comers we have a new hot rod in mind. Now it's up to her to take that torch and carry it across the finish lineor not.I've read a number of reviews that have bad mouthed this film and almost all had the same complaint: it wasn't the same movie they'd seen before. It made me wonder why they didn't see the positives in this film, the fact that it extended the life of the series with this new development. It also provides a great lesson for young people to learn and draws in older viewers as well who understand what it's like to go through what McQueen does.The animation by Pixar remains top of the line. I've seen other movies doing this sort of CGI animation and while good they don't compare. The story moves along at a steady pace and never involves moments where you wish it would move along faster. It's a compelling story that needs to be told.It's great that the voice over actors have returned time and time again to do the voices and keep continuity in doing so. New actors in new roles do an amazing job as well. Now if they will all continue to do so in the future.CARS 3 is not the first film but one unto itself. It may involve the same characters but there is a slightly different story going on here. Push play and know that going in and you'll be delighted to see the old crew, the new crew and the new story unfold. For me it was a delight and a movie I know I'll pop back in every once in a while. Come to think of it this would make a great movie marathon with the first 2 for my younger nieces and nephews. Time to go out and pick up some microwave popcorn and have them over."
101,Cars 3,10,8 July 2017,?,"I try to teach my children that their choices matter, to others as well as themselves. I try to give them the knowledge I have gained in life to help ensure a happy adulthood for them. By no means do I promise them a stress-free, choice-free life. That being said, I am really surprised to find so many negative reviews. This movie had so many great messages, yet was filled with action, comedy, and all around entertainment. The only conclusion I can come to is that many people were disappointed that it wasn't nonstop tractor tipping and eating ""bad pistachio ice cream"". As far as the kids go, (and we own 1 & 2, which they love) they actually voted Cars 3 as their favorite. If you see the full 3 minute preview before watching the movie, you should not be too surprised at the narrative (I did not see the TV aired preview, but if it did not contain a lot of the same information, I could see how that may leave people disappointed and upset)."
102,Cars 3,8,5 July 2017,Back to Basics,"I took my 4 year old and 2 year old sons to this movie. They both loved it! I also thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought they really brought back a lot of the basics that made the original Cars so successful. My 4 year old has been obsessed with Cars for 2 years now, so I consider myself a bit of an expert as I have seen each movie over 20x :) This movie had a lot of teachable moments for my children. I love that it showed the friendship and respect that the 'old' race cars had for each other. It also made it clear how important it is to accept change. And it showed, that if you work hard for something, you can achieve it. I think Cruz is an awesome character and I love that they transitioned McQueen into her mentor as Doc was for him. Overall, I think it was made well and they got back to basics and made it more about racing and core relationships."
103,Cars 3,10,1 July 2017,A movie that improves on the last one...,"When Cars first came out in 2006, it became a hit for pixar and Disney under their new ownership. The film would sell even more on DVD and bluray and spawn merchandise, as well as two sequels and a spin off film about Planes and a sequel that didn't lift off at the box office. Now here comes Cars 3, a movie that is better than Cars 2 and brings back the nascar theme that the first movie fit so well. It's also rated G, which means everyone from 2 to 102 can enjoy it. I saw it in 3d and it's worth seeing in 3d. The short that precedes it, Lou, is really good. Stay after the end credits for a bonus scene!!!"
104,Cars 3,9,24 June 2017,Cars 3 is an excellent addition to the franchise,"Cars 1 introduced audiences of 2006 into the world of lightning McQueen, a cocky driver with a big potential. The film develops him into a character who cares less of winner and more of sportsmanship. Cars 2 (2011) built on his legacy where it reveals that McQueen is one of the best drivers in the world having won 5 piston cups. Thus allowing him to be invited to the World Grand Prix. Whilst the third instalment Cars 3 (2017) reveals a car who is well past his prime and is on the out of the racing world. He decides to have more go to prove to himself and his doubters that he can still race. Ultimately decided to pass on his legacy rather than ""beating a dead horse"" and decides to move into coaching. This is a great move by Pixar and I can understand why they've done this. The series began in 2006 and was marketed to children between the ages of 4 and 10. Understanding this when cars 2 was released it did well at box office as many of the original audience were only 5 years older. But the second instalment was not Pixars finest work and did no favours in developing the brand as a whole. This is why Cars 3 was done like it was. When Cars 3 was released it had much of the same audience from 2006 meaning most of those children were now 16-20. Meaning the series needed to come to a close. This final instalment was not meant for small children but for the original audience as a sort of farewell to an iconic part of their childhood. The movie did this perfectly showing what happens to real sports-people, new recruits under better training plans come in and out-do the stars of old. This thing happens in sports all the time, why else would any athlete retire?. This is what happens to Mcqueen and Pixar being Pixar reveal a family friendly message that their is more to life than competing, that life is about others and helping others achieve their goals. McQueen had his time in the sunlight and it was time for him to move on and help others. Cars 3 is a excellent conclusion for the iconic series"
105,Cars 3,8,17 June 2017,""" One of the best trilogy ends i ever see""","Cars was is a classic,Cars 2 was a disappointment,Cars 3 is simply one of the best closing trilogy's i ever see (at least in animation).The story in many ways is a adult story for kids but the movie never loose the road and the classic characters are back an new ones two.Now we all see the teasers and trailers so i don't gonna spoil something here,The question that lighting McQueen do in all the movie is:I am old? My time already pass?...well you have to see the movie to discover that.The movie have soul,magic,emotion,chemistry something i don't see in a lot time...Believe me when i tell you that the movie is great (even in the theater everyone was applauding in the best scenes and in the end of the movie...something that a never see in a animated movie lately)..so you can understand the feeling in the theater.Cars 3 is simply on the best animated movies i ever see in last years and yes...Pixar make another classic...Bravo Maestros."
106,Cars 3,8,4 September 2017,This is the end.,"This is the decent ending to a great first movie. I wasn't very sure that bringing my 12 yo son to this would be a good idea.I was wrong. He really enjoyed it and we cried like babies when Mcqueen crashed (no spoil eh it's in the trailer). This is no car race movie like fast and furious, haters got it wrong IMHO. This is a movie about sport spirit and generations.As usual from Pixar , this movie is technically perfect. Thanks to them !"
107,Cars 3,5,9 December 2017,"Bland and uninspiring, but a massive improvement on Cars 2","From a purely merchandising point of view, Pixar's Cars franchise is nothing short of a masterstroke. Even if the films, spin-offs, and straight-to-DVD shorts aren't up to scratch - and they aren't - children will be sure to ask mummy and daddy for the latest sleek toy, no matter how obscure the character. In response, the Cars movies have added numerous forgettable new characters with each film, adding to their extensive range of collectables in the process. It's a cynical approach, but merchandise has always been Disney's bread-and-butter in their quest to seemingly own everything. As a result, Cars 2 was a huge disappointment; a half- arsed sequel to a movie that had already left many underwhelmed, which took the central story off on a random tangent and promoted the annoying sidekick to the central hero. Still, it made lots of money, so a trilogy-closer was inevitable.Thankfully, Pixar and director Brian Fee have scrapped the spy thriller angle altogether, and relegated buck-toothed tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) back to the role of comic relief dished out in small doses. The focus is back on Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his antics on the race track, so Cars 3 is, if anything, a massive improvement on its predecessor. McQueen is now in the twilight of his career; a seven- time Piston Cup champion and bona fide racing legend, enjoying the on- track banter with his closest rivals. However, he is given a wake-up call when newcomer Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer), employing a fancy chassis, the latest in car technology, and an extensive knowledge of statistics, beats McQueen easily. Soon enough, his fellow veterans start retiring in droves, and those who don't are quickly laid off by their sponsors to make way for the new guys hot off the assembly line (or are they born?).It's a bland and uninspiring story of the new out-muscling the old, but there are still things to enjoy in Cars 3. They've finally enlisted a female racer in the form of energetic personal trainer Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), who treats McQueen like a car ready to fall apart at any second, and it also offers a fitting resolution to Doc's story, who was splendidly voiced by Paul Newman before he sadly passed, as McQueen seeks out a new mentor. Yet, the beautiful and detailed animation, combined with the welcome return to the grit of the race track, cannot save Cars 3 from mediocrity. It's essentially an existential exploration of midlife crisis, chocked full of childish humour and wrapped up in a sports movie formula, so it's difficult to work out just who the target audience is. It wisely makes a point of dodging genre clichés with an interesting climax, but the lack of character investment (McQueen has always been the blandest of Pixar's heroes) means that this doesn't pay off as well as it should. Like its racers, the Cars franchise seems to be stuck in an eternal loop without anywhere to go."
108,Cars 3,9,20 July 2017,The third one the greatest..,"I saw the first cars when i was a kid and i totally enjoyed it as i did with every Pixar film. When i saw the second one i was a teenager and i didn't really love it but still was a good film for kids though.So when i went to see this one yesterday i wasn't expecting that much for my entertainment and let me be honest and tell you that i was completely wrong. I enjoyed as much or more than my ten and eight years old brothers.It is a totally great film with a lot of good messages not just for kids but for adults too as Pixar used to do.And yes i wanted lightning McQueen to win at the end as everyone at the cinema but always winning is boring and doesn't happen in real life. I'm twenty years old now and i know that i'm super young but i was completely overwhelmed with the getting older thing and the changes, accepting those changes and the time and that great thing about being happy with who you are and what you have.The thing about getting older happened to me the same as a teenager with toy story 3 but being an adult now and at this time when everything change so fast and hours are minutes and minutes like seconds it just makes the film one of my favourites from Pixar. You know changes happens all the time and is important to accept those changes to be happy in every time of your life you are at. Even as kid or at the end of your childhood or you career.My brothers enjoyed the movie a lot and we get to laugh so much too. Im not a feminist but super glad with Cruz Ramírez and how she gets a chance to prove herself in a man's world.And for those moms who says that your kids were bored...that just depends on how and what are you teaching them. You can take them to watch the despicable me movie and make your kids not learning anything from it.Life isn't laughing all the time you know and personally i like that kids learn something in everything they watch.In conclusion i'm so happy with Cars 3 and happy watching my bros grow with films that are as good as the films i grew up with.Greetings from Argentina. Saludos."
109,Cars 3,9,30 June 2017,It was a really good movie after all.,"It was a good movie in all, and just saying: Jackson Storm is way meaner then he appears in the trailers. He is not like bullying Lightning McQueen or anything like that, he is just kinda hard on him. The movie is well put together and has its funny moments. Anyway really good movie and hope in a few years they will make another one (probably not) so go do yourself a favor and see it!!!"
110,Cars 3,9,18 June 2017,Return to Form For Pixar Franchise,"Watched Cars 3 featuring the Voice Talents of Owen Wilson(Zoolander No.2) as Lightning McQueen, Armie Hammer(The Man From U.N.C.L.E) as Jackson Storm, Cristela Alonzo(The Angry Birds Movie) as Cruz Ramirez, Larry The Cable Guy(Blue Collar) as Mater , Bonnie Hunt(Zootopia) as Sally Carrera, Chris Cooper (The Muppets) as Smokey,Nathan Fillion(Con Man) as Sterling ,John Ratzenberger(Inside Out) as Mack featuring The Late Paul Newman(Cars) as Doc Hudson and Richard Petty(Speedway) as Strip ""The King"" Weathers. The film also excellent character development and story glad this was more focused on Lightning McQueen as Cars 2 should've been also Cruise Ramirez was one the best characters though she was annoying at times but it didn't hurt the film to much was brilliant amazing Musical Score by Randy Newman(Toy Story) also Amazing Direction by Newcomer Brian Fee(Monsters University) A Return to Form For Pixar Franchise 9/10"
111,Cars 3,10,3 September 2017,I am positive.,"I saw many of us criticizing the film. They may seems OK, yet i doubt with that. It reminds me a change in generation. I first saw the first sequel being a student, with not that rationality in my mind regarding the meaning of life or how its gonna go through the paradigm of shift. Now i see the last one keeping me on the red car character whose high time is about to an end. Movie finishes with a fresh set up on stage. We might see in the next sequel where the new car (of third sequel) will be the hot rod like the second sequel. I will dream my new born baby kid on that character. :)"
112,Cars 3,10,15 June 2017,Great Reflection on the Original,"Just saw this film at an early family showing before the actual release, and I have to say, it was a great companion to the original! By that, I mean, you see from Lightning McQueen's perspective exactly how Hudson felt in the original film.Seeing how Lightning makes his way in a group of rookies is very reminiscent of himself against the King and Chick Hicks in the original. Ligtning seems to be humbled in this new entry. However, Michael Keaton as Chick Hicks voice is surely missed. Even my seven year old son asked!Glad to see the flashbacks, but sometimes overused. A great movie experience for the whole family."
113,Cars 3,8,17 June 2017,The best Cars yet!,"This was really, really good! Executive Producer John Lasseter had teased that the film would be a very emotional story and a little bit more akin to the first installation. The film was exactly that. The story was strong, the characters were strong, the visuals were strong, the music was strong (yay Randy Newman), and it was overall a great movie. The film focuses on the future of McQueen's career as well as his relationship and memory of Doc Hudson. Paying tribute to the first installation the movie starts off with McQueens pep talk quickly making lighthearted fun of it. After that the film gets in to the theme of you are never to old for your passion and you should never give up. Through heart felt moments that take us down memory lane the movie teaches viewers to share our passions and always believe in not only yourself, but others. This is shown through mentoring from older racers and the loyalty both Rust-eze and the gang (Mater, Sally, Luigi, Guido) display. The film introduces a few new characters and surprising most are females. Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), McQueens trainer, is a central piece to the plot and become a great role model for younger kids. Miss Fritter (Lea DeLaria) at first is shown as a hard headed demolition derby bus demonstrating you don't always have to look pristine and that some people have a rough exterior, but later she reveals her passions and her depth as a character (also love the reference to Miss Frizzle). Finally one of the elder racers (actual person), Louise Nash (Margo Martindale) admits to having a crush on Doc Hudson, but also brings up the fact that the guys didn't like a woman winning races and she did it anyway because she loved it. Overall the story nearly made me cry out of tenderness and the entire auditorium clapped after the final race as well as the end of the film. Honestly if you haven't seen any of the films you need to watch the first one and this one. Yes they are that good!8/10I'd go see it again. Loved it even with the 200 kids talking the entire time!"
114,Cars 3,6,25 June 2017,'Cars 3' Review,"'Cars 3' is, in summary, a decent film despite not matching regular Pixar standards. The first film, titled 'Cars' was released in 2016. While welcome to relatively successful reviews, yet in terms of Pixar Art 'Cars' is often overlooked alongside other classics (ie; Toy Story, Wall-E, Incredibles, etc). Yet when you google the phrase 'Pixar Films', 'Cars' is ordinarily one of the first results produced. Why is it the first suggestion when there are clearly far superior Pixar films available?The answer is retail. In total, Cars has grossed over $8 billion, both in retail and in box office sales, making it one of the biggest Pixar/Disney franchises to date. Annually, the Cars franchise grosses around $2 billion. And although there have been more financially successful Pixar hits (ie, Finding Dory, Toy Story 3), 'Cars' is particularly impressive because the revenue never seems to decrease significantly. It is a fluctuant cash cow for Disney, each sequel provides a welcome surplus of income. And 'Cars 2,' despite relatively massive box office approval, is a prominent dark spot both in Pixar and 'Cars' history. The film's most significant problem, is my opinion, is its dramatic genre switch. This may have been acceptable in say, 'Cars 4,' where the general world has been established and the franchise is in need of a genre switch. But this was the SECOND movie, and did not have the needed support to make such a significant shift. But enough about 'Cars 2,' here is my opinion on the third installment. I will address the detractions and benefits of this film. BENEFITSFirstly, 'Cars 3' features a female lead, Cruz Ramirez. I think that this new feminist positivity in Hollywood is terribly beneficial. 2017 has held women empowering hits such as 'Wonder Woman,' and yes, even 'Beauty and the Beast.' (I loathed that movie with a passion, but I'll give them this.) Cruz is ultimately portrayed in a positive light, and I did like that. Secondly, the animation. Pixar and Disney are known for their exemplary animation techniques, and 'Cars 3' is no exception. I found my inner child squealing the most during the racing sequences. 'Cars 2' tried desperately to introduce Mater as a new character, yet his irritable humor and general aura are part of the reason 'Cars 2' is so loathed. Mater is still in #3, but plays a very minor role as the chemistry and main relationship is mostly between McQueen and Cruz. Decimating Mater made the movie ten times more enjoyable. DETRACTIONS Most of 'Cars 3' is spent establishing Lightning McQueen and his return to racing dominancy. Cruz, while a main character given ambitions and personality, is not working toward the racing success McQueen is. She is not the focus. Without spoiling; Cruz holds a prominent part in the 'Cars 3' climax where certain abilities must be used. The god-like abilities shown in the climax by Cruz do not match the implications and information about Cruz offered prior. This is a noticeable error. Also, the villain, Jackson Storm, is so one dimensional that the film would have been unchanged without him. The conflict could purely be McQueen realizing the inevitability of physical deterioration due to age. I will go as far as to say that he was actually a detraction; that the film would have been more thoughtful (in that classic Pixar manner) by not having an obvious antagonist. Instead having something we will all have to face, growing age, would have made a smarter movie. The humor in the first half was practically nonexistent. There was obviously effort but it never really paid off. Fortunately, 'Cars 3' picks up in the last half and thankfully includes better jokes. However, if you are walking into the theater purely for laughs (unlikely, but still) then this film is not for you. A significant amount of the movie could be cut out and it would remain virtually unaffected. For example, McQueen and Cruz are somehow in the middle of a mud wrestling car racing competition (a bad description, I know, but work with me). Cruz wins. McQueen gets bad publicity. And then the movie continues. The scene had no overall context and contributed nothing except insignificant conflict. If they wanted to establish this conflict with Cruz getting McQueen in hot water with the press, then they could have. The conflict could have been done a lot better. And smarter. Kind of like this movie. 6.5/1065% C+"
115,Cars 3,5,21 June 2017,"A better ""Cars"" movie than the previous, but still pretty basic","I went into this movie expecting to not like it a whole lot, and I wasn't wrong, as the Cars movies are notorious for being the worst that Pixar has to offer. This movie is simply just 'okay'. Some of the best choices in this film were moving away from the last one and moving back towards the ""strengths"" of the original film, focusing less on Mater and more on Lightning McQueen and his racing career. This sounds like a positive, however the first half of this movie is an absolute SLOG, with the pacing of a Saturday morning cartoon, introducing new characters that are supposed to be longtime friends of Lightning that we've never met before, trying to form some kind of sentimental connection that was never there to begin with. The plot is relatively predictable, and operates as a comeback story, but the way it executes it toward the end and the message it brings through is actually pretty positive. The whole film is centered around Lightning not being the fastest car anymore, and him training with his new trainer Cruz to become faster, while along the way forming a personal connection with Cruz, who really wants to not be a trainer, but rather desires to be a racer. Lightning eventually realizes he can't be the same racer he used to be, and following in the footsteps of his former race coach, puts Cruz in the final race and moves on to a new stage of his life, accepting his old age and moving forward with something new. I really like this, however the execution could've been a whole lot better, as the jokes really aren't too funny and the story is pretty predictable, and really holds the hand of the viewer, as well as including a whole lot of side characters that never really do a whole lot. As a kids movie though, it's perfectly suitable, and I can definitely recommend this for any family to see. 5.2/10"
116,Cars 3,,15 June 2017,"Great summer fun and social issues, too.","""You'll never be the racer you once were. You can't turn back the clock, kid, but you can wind it up, again."" Smokey (voice of Chris Cooper)If you think this is a kids' movie, think again. It is part philosophical treatise on the challenges of aging and the emergence of successful women. For the former, Cars 3 gently guides us through the aging pains of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson); for the latter, his female crew member, Cruz Romero (Cristela Olonzo), emerges as a potent force to rejuvenate the aging speedster and, like Wonder Woman, usher in a new generation of female heroes.By no means is this a boring movie for youngsters, who will delight in the amusing little talking cars and some pretty fancy track work. The kids older than six will be edified by the joy with which aging can bring its challenges and rewards, as McQueen learns how to compete with his slower reflexes but accumulated wisdom to outfox the young upstart, Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer).Aging parents and grandparents will get the most pleasure out of this animation, nodding approval as it counsels smarts versus foolish talent, wit versus gender discrimination. Throughout, director Brian Fee and his gang of writers that includes original Kiel Murray keep focused, like the best car competitors, on the goal, in this case competing when everyone feels you don't have a chance.Both old timers and women are the winners in this race, regardless of who wins."
117,Cars 3,10,15 June 2017,The Best of the Sequels so far but the first film is still the best!!,"Lightning McQueen sets out to prove to a new generation of racers that he's still the best race car in the world. Cars 3 is the 2nd sequel to the Cars Franchise and this time it's more grounded than it's predecessor because Cars 2 is often described as one of Pixar's and Disney's Worst Films but in my opinion it wasn't that bad i enjoyed the fact that Mater was the main star of that film but the Spy stuff did get a bit out of hand sometimes. Now Cars 3 on the other hand it goes back to the roots of the original 2006 Cars film you have the gang back together Lightning, Mater, Luigi, Sally, Guido, Mack and pretty much everyone returns for the sequel and somehow they even brought back the legendary Doc Hudson who was voiced by the late Paul Newman and even after his death and mostly threw flashbacks Hudson provides some of the most touching moments of the film which is one of the best things about Cars 3, the animation is stunning and beautiful looking and the performances from both the old and new Cast are quite good especially the character of Cruz Ramirez was my favorite part of the film. Now where the movie kinda struggles is within it's Drama and as much as i might chuckle sometimes with the humor or even say 'hell yeah' when the action hits i wanted to feel something the same something that i felt when i watched Toy Story 3 and unfortunately that doesn't happen with Cars 3 and even tho i did shed a tear in 2 scenes it didn't affect me as much as i wanted to and that bothered me a lot to be honest because McQueen is now older and he is closer to retirement and that should be dramatic and i feel that the writers didn't try as much as they could and should, also even tho the movie is 1 hour and 49 minutes i feel that some stuff go by pretty quick like the feud with Jackson Storm and Lightning McQueen was pretty quick and Storm doesn't get enough screen time in order to become a complete villain, the drama as i said goes by pretty damn quick and the training that McQueen does at the end it all goes for nothing because of the plot twist that happens in the end. I might sound like i hated Cars 3 but i really did not because i did have fun with it and i did enjoyed the performances, the animation, the Rocky III- IV-V and Creed inspired storyline and even the soundtrack was pretty damn good and even tho it's a better sequel than Cars 2 it just doesn't reach the excitement, the fun and the drama of the first film but it's still a movie that i think that both Kids and their Parents will enjoy and do yourself a favor: DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS when it comes to this particular Franchise because if you enjoyed the first 2 films you're definitely going to enjoy this one too but if you hated both Cars and Cars 2 you're definitely going to hate Cars 3. (A-)"
118,Cars 3,8,23 July 2017,Brilliant movie with a surprise anti fan boy twist,"Lot of scenes in the movie follow a predictable pattern, the main plot being how a hero from a previous generation can keep himself relevant in a changing world. And he does it. How he does it is endearing, thought provoking and down right brilliant.If you are not a fan boy, you will like it. It will make you think."
119,Cars 3,9,9 July 2017,Great Movie,Great movie with lots of classic Pixar charm up until the ending. I hate the fact that McQueen didn't finish the race and Cruz Ramirez did instead. I grew up watching the Cars franchise and seeing this ending made me scream in frustration. Still a great movie with a lot of plot and story. Glad to see that they acted as if Cars 2 never happened in the movie. Also watch out for the Apple references because there are A LOT. Overall loved it and would highly recommend seeing it.
120,Cars 3,8,6 July 2017,"Kid tested, parent approved!","My five year-old son and I waited an entire year for Cars 3 to be released. This highly anticipated movie had a lot to live up to, since my son has been conjuring up many scenarios as to how the plot would unfold. He's a huge Car's fan, and we literally counted the days before the June 16 release.Cars 3 differs from Cars 2 by going back to the roots established in Cars 1. Cars 3 is based on introspection and devotion to friends and recognizing one's limitations in the face of insurmountable challenges.The acid test for me, the father, was to see how my son accepted the movie. It was a clear hit. He loved it! And so did I. On the surface, the movie never has the typical come-back-kid moment that has Lightning suddenly excel as the clear winner. This isn't a spoiler, because there's a twist at the end that you must see to appreciate. That I will not reveal here.What I will reveal is the path Lightning takes to prepare for a potential final race against a Next Gen rookie named Jackson Storm. Storm is a new breed of racer who sports the latest racing technology and is a product of cutting-edge training. Lightning's top speed is 198 MPH. Storm's is 214 MPH. This presents a clear challenge to the now-aging McQueen, and he must find a way to beat him using smarts, not speed. A new character is presented, a female car named Cruz Ramirez who acts as Lightning's trainer. They work together to prepare for the final showdown along with Doc Hudson's replacement, a former colleague named Smokey.This entry into the Cars movie lineup adopts a bittersweet tone, as Lightning evaluates the future of his racing career and the legacy he has created. His mentor, Doc Hudson, has passed, and Lightning looks towards his memory and teaching for inspiration. Lightning recognizes his racing days are ending, but does he retire now, or will he retire later? He makes a deal with a billionaire investor named Sterling to race with the agreement that, if he loses, he retires. If he wins, Lightning decides when he retires.While some fans may be put off by the aging aspect of Lightning's career, it presents a true-to-life reality that we all age and must face the reality of our future. As Clint Eastwood famously quoted in Magnum Force, ""A man's got to know his limitations."" In Cars 3, Lightning recognizes his limitations and races smart to compensate for his aging speed.For us, Cars 3 is kid tested and daddy approved. We've seen the movie twice and highly recommend it to all Cars fans. It's a fun movie that works well not only for children, but also adults."
121,Cars 3,8,2 July 2017,It seems like some don't get it,Everyone that said that Lighting just quit doesn't get the point (or points) of the movie. Lightning decided to give up his last chance for someone else to have their first chance. He also realized that there's more to life than personal glory. Helping others succeed can be even more rewarding. This is very much in line with the first one where he gives up the piston cup to help The King finish his last race.
122,Cars 3,8,1 July 2017,Loved the movie,"Major spoil alerts!Reading the reviews for this movie I gotta wonder if we watched the same movie. For one thing, McQueen did NOT quit. He made it very clear that he was going to keep racing. But there was something he wanted to do first and that was to train Cruz. So no he did not retire or quit. I loved the movie. It came in full circle in so many ways. Love the graphics, the humor everything. I gave it an 8 out of 10 because I didn't like the derby scene and some quotes that we heard in the trailers were left out. What I saw is a movie about a veteran (and yes he is a veteran) who is facing the Threat of retirement but doesn't want to retire. He tries to train like someone else but realizes that isn't working. In my opinion his decision about Cruz wasn't random. It was him wanting to give someone a second chance. I love the movie. I think the reason I loved the movie is because I had already suspected that McQueen would either become a crew chief or win the race himself. Just st wasn't expecting both! I always envision the end of a movie before watching it. I want cars 4!!!"
123,Cars 3,6,25 June 2017,Pixar  Is in decline,"Comes to us ladies and gentlemen, the work of works, probably the best film of the best saga of .... The truth is that I do not like Cars.It seems to me a mediocre, uninspired and very concentrated film in the merchandising. And the second part is not said.For this and combined with the fact that Pixar has recently released 3 films of which only one could meet the expectations, the truth is that very happy was not with the premiere of this new movie. Cars 3 is a film with an interesting central theme, it tries to grow old, to be replaced and that the world is constantly changing and we can not do anything to avoid it. All this I dream very well, but by the time the film decides to put it into practice everything goes to hell. But why? Well mostly I think it's the commitment to the issues and the approach to the plot. I explain, the film could be divided into 2 parts, the first where all the above mentioned topics are treated and another where a new topic is treated. Bringing the hand to a new generation. However it is noted that the film is not decided between any of them, one would expect that I entered these two themes opened a natural transition so you do not feel that you have just gotten a beating with a hammer, but it is not. Just when the goal of the film is going to reach, she decides to change her objective and betrays herself in order to fulfill that new goal. It was not possible to compromise with its main subject the very pretentious of .....But it's not all, the message is affected by the villain, ""storm"" which, although at first it looked like an interesting character, term being the flat est and basest villain I've seen in a long time.Also the film has a rhythm problem, especially two parts where the characters decide to travel to quiet village and this makes the plot late to move forward. And this coupled with the fact that the film does not know how to use flashbacks, they are used when they are not required and when they are ... Well, they just forget them, and again this ends up encouraging the rhythm.And something that I did not think was disastrous, but if I found it very uncomfortable and distracting was the use of the soundtrack, which is ... It's Toy Story, it's not really the music seems extracted from Toy story, and could Say ""okay then you have some quality in this section"" and now I have to say yes and no. The music in this movie I weighed to that it is good does not really stay with what is being seen on the screen, it is too quiet for the wings scenes that are accompanied.Ah ... Many will surely be thinking ""hey old man,"" ""it's just a kid's movie, do not ask him so much"" and right there's the problem. Not because it is a movie dedicated to children, it means that it can not have quality. Why if one does not demand quality in these films one ends up having things like: ""canine selection"" or ""Los minions"".And I think that demanding quality in this case is even more important because it is Pixar who makes this film, and luckily, the echo of Pixar who is doing it, causes that there is a certain quality standard.To start the animation ...... OH MY GOD WHAT BEAUTIFUL YOU SEE EVERYTHING is awesome, the quality of the earth, the water, EVERYTHING, you can feel the affection and dedication that you had to this section.And likewise there is something I wanted to try. Characters. They are very well worked, or good at least our two protagonists are, the Lightning and Cross are very well done and this helps that for example Cruz at the end of the film can say support and understanding.The characters are identifiable with the viewer. And probably if a child sees this movie to see the development that the characters have, he will think ""wow, I want to be like them"".In the end, the film ends up being very conformist, it ends up only pleasing its demographic audience, and this especially annoys me because with the subject that they had in hand they could see echo something very great, but no, in order I suppose that it is worth dreaming .6.5"
124,Cars 3,10,20 June 2017,Good fun,"As the Piston Cup season progresses, Lightning McQueen and his fellow veteran racers find themselves overshadowed by Jackson Storm, an arrogant racer who is part of a new generation who use the latest technology to boost their performance. As more and more next generation cars begin racing, the older racers gradually retire or are fired by their sponsors. During the final race of the season, Lightning tries to overtake Storm, but loses control and suffers a violent rollover crash."
125,Cars 3,8,18 June 2017,Cars 3 was a really well written animation movie,"I think Cars 3 was a really well written animation movie which has a lot of conceptual dialogues. It is very entertaining, and very enlightening and sometimes unpredictable. It teaches you how to not let go of your dream and inspires you to fight for it. I recommend this animation to those who want to motivate and entertain themselves."
126,Cars 3,8,18 June 2017,Didn't Expect to Like it So Much,"I remember being blown away by Cars when I took my 6-year-old son to see it in 2006; we watched the DVD so much that we had most of the lines memorized by the time he was 7.But Cars 2 left us flat, and our local paper gave Cars 3 only 2 out of 4 stars, so I didn't expect much. But today I took my now-17-year-old son to Cars 3 and loved it! I laughed a lot (so did he) and almost cried a couple of times because it was so touching. Some beautiful symmetry between Cars and Cars 3, as well as within the new story itself."
127,Cars 3,8,24 June 2017,You finally feel the heart in Act 3,"Movie Title: Cars 3 (Theatrical)Grade: A-Rating: G, 109 minutesIn a Nutshell: This family-friendly flick is the third installment in the Cars franchise. By the way, the Cars ride at California Adventures next to Disneyland in California is really great. You'll need to race over there first thing in the morning to get a Fast Pass. They have done a really good job creating a Cars area too. Uplifting theme: ""You can't turn back the clock, but you can wind it up again.""  Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) ""Don't feel failure. Be afraid of not having the chance!""  Sally (Bonnie Hunt) ""Try something new.""  Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) ""You can use anything negative as fuel to push through to the positive.""  Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo) ""The truth is always quicker.""  old car (What's his name?) Believe in yourself.Things I liked: The animation is extremely impressive. The training sequences were pretty cute. A lot of really beautiful landscapes and environments. It earns its Pixar magic in the Third Act. Very sweet. Parents and grandparents might be able to relate to the feeling of aging and being past their prime, like Lightning McQueen feels. There is a positive lesson here for all of us old farts. It's great to hear John Ratzenburger's voice again. Other familiar, favorite voice talents include Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, Bonnie Hunt, Kerry Washington, Nathan Fillion, Bob Costas, and of course, Owen Wilson.Things I didn't like: The story is very similar to the first movie in that an old driver (Doc Hudson) has-been tries to make a comeback. How many kids (which is the target audience) are going to be able to relate to a midlife crisis? There is a LOT of time spent racing. That might lose the interest of some little girls. Despite being a racing moving, it's a little slow-moving. Ironic, eh? There isn't as much humor as the first movie.Trivia: Paul Newman was the original voice of Doc Hudson. They used some of the unused audio clips from the first movie to add his voice to this film after his death. By the way, did you know Paul Newman was a race car driver for many years? Mack drives through Arlo's family farm, which was shown in Pixar's movie The Good Dinosaur. One of the new racers whose number is 31 is sponsored by Triple Dent Gum, which was the gum commercial that annoyed Anger in the movie Inside Out. The only other Pixar film to have a 3rd movie installment is Toy Story. All three Cars movies came out around the same time as Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Look closely and you'll see a Pizza Planet truck from Toy Story during the demolition scene.Funny lines: ""Life's a beach and then you drive.""  Lighning McQueen Tips for parents: This is very safe for children of all ages. There is no profanity or anything inappropriate. There are some car crashes.Want to catch up on the first two movies in this franchise? Cars Cars 2 @trinaboice"
128,Cars 3,8,21 June 2017,"Spoiler free review: A decent sequel, but fails to surpass the original","""Cars 3"" is Pixar's latest film... and I can't say whether I was pleased with the film, or overwhelmed with disappointment. I found 2/3 of the movie to be decent, enjoyable and even humorous at times. But then the ending came, and I was VERY disappointed because it just does not send the correct message to the audience.Overall, 2/3 of the film was great but has the worst ending in ANY Pixar film I have seen to date.6/10."
129,Cars 3,6,18 June 2017,Disney for Dollar Signs,"Cars 1 was a huge hit, and everyone banked on the success of Cars 1 to make Cars 2 a success, but it failed. It was way over kids' head to understand the plot and storyline of Cars 2, but not every movie can be a success, so we give Pixar that one. Cue up to the teaser trailer for Cars 3, it looks like it's going to be AMAZING! Lightning gets in a HUGE wreck, newer and faster cars, what is Lightning McQueen gonna do??? We were all hooked months ago, and Disney and Pixar knew it. Now cue up to opening day for Cars 3 and people are ready to take their entire families to see the movie, one that should rescue the series, at least, that's what I thought. This movie was so far beyond predictable, that it was at times very boring to watch. I am not one to go to the bathroom during any movie that I go see, especially because I paid to see it, I can hold it, but I found myself getting up in the middle because I just didn't care. I won't give away any of the plot, but it seemed like they wanted to cram so much story in a very short 90 minute family movie.Here is what I did find and almost got sick of finding, Lightning McQueen changed his paint job about 3 times in the movie, Cruz Ramirez changed her paint job 4 times in the movie, there are MANY new characters in the movie, including the tractors (cows) from Cars 1 that have race car paint jobs at one point in the movie as well. This means, that if your child LOVES Lightning McQueen, and sees the movie and decides that on their next birthday, they want all of the toys from Cars 3 in order to use their imagination and reenact the entire movie, get ready to spend A LOT of money for them to do it, and by the way, most of these new characters were unnecessary to move the plot forward, they were just present for Disney to do their own version of product placement. What a joke."
130,Cars 3,7,22 June 2017,"For fans of the first one, Cars 3 is a nice U-turn to form as it confronts remaining in the race","Pixar is back in theaters to bring life to areas we normally don't see it insoyay! It happens to be a third Cars moviesoyay? I've spoken with a lot of film and animation fanatics who don't see the Cars series as anything worth mentioning. It's spoken around circles as only kids entertainment and a way to sell a ton of toys (Disney has made over a billion on the Cars toys alone). Is it worth a lot of the backlash? Though there is some nostalgic value over the original Cars, as I consider it the last animated movie from my childhood before going to college, I think people have gotten too harsh on it.It may not have the same emotional impact of Toy Story, Up, and Inside Out, but when I saw Cars, I thought it was a nice tribute to those small towns on Route 66 and heartfelt look at NASCAR racing. The sequel, Cars 2 is where a lot of the anger is stirred up for the series. That went from small town heart to a spy story and put too much focus on Larry the Cable Guy. It's not that good and this is what people try to use when they justify why they don't like Cars. Let's see if Cars 3 can make that U-turn. Lightning McQueen (played by Owen Wilson), who was once the rookie, is now in a loosing streak, thanks to the younger Jackson Storm (played by Armie Hammer). He, along with several new racers, cause the older racers to either be let go or retire. Lightning does his best to keep up, but within the last race of the season, he ends up in a horrible crash that mirrors his late mentor, Doc Hudson. Though he contemplates retirement, Lightening tells his sponsors that he'd still like to race, but needs to train in a new way. He arrives at the newly built training center to discover that the business is now owned by Sterling (played by Nathan Fillion). He's introduced to his trainer Cruz Ramirez (played by Cristela Alonzo) who wants him to use all the latest gadgets like VR and simulators. Lightning considers that while noticing that Cruz is actually pretty good at racing herself. Nevertheless, Lightning gets as much advice as he can from her, Doc Hudson's old crew chief Smokey (played by Chris Cooper), and his Radiator Springs friends like Mater (played by Larry the Cable Guy) and Sally (played by Bonnie Hunt).It seems that the folks at Pixar heard the complaints about Cars 2 and took the story back to the NASCAR racing roots. This one plays out a lot like Rocky III, where the hero is hurt and needs to find that drive (or the eye of the tiger). For the case of Cars 3, it works fine enough to make it a good sequel. I can't say it's great, but I can't imagine what great things you can do with this set up. As far as the story is concerned, it's not the most original, but it does allow for some good side trips (including a fun sequence at a demolition derby) and a nice sequence that talks more about Doc Hudson. It also addresses the issue of racers getting older and facing the pressure from fellow racers and sponsors to retire. It's never fun to hear to your getting older, but we even get a good conversation about what can make you happy with what you do. It certainly does feel the most emotional Cars has gotten, though it's still not as hard hitting as Inside Out.I can't say too much about the animation, which does look good, but it's what we've come to expect Pixar to do. Voice acting is about the same as all the previous players do just as well as before (Larry the Cable Guy has a much smaller role, probably in response to his overuse in Cars 2) and the newcomers are likable, especially Cristela Alonzo. I'll give this seven Lightning McQueens out of ten. Though it's a nice return to form, I don't have a lot to say about Cars 3 other then it's closer to the original and probably just as good. Film fans that want that same emotional punch that Inside Out and Up gave are not going to get it here. If you didn't like the previous movies, your not going to be won over here. But if the first one entertained you, you'll get what your looking for. Consider your position, and race to check it out."
131,Cars 3,6,20 November 2017,Rocky,"Champion Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) faces new competition from arrogant hi-tech rookie Jackson Storm. His friends are forced into retirement and replaced by the new generation of racers. He starts losing to Storm and a final crash ends his failing season. With the new season approaching, he faces self-doubt and the press expects his retirement. He gets new owner Sterling and new trainer Cruz Ramirez.It's a good idea for Rocky, I mean Lightning, to find new meaning in training a young replacement. At least, that should have been this movie. It plays around with the idea and finally ends up there but it takes its time. In the meanwhile, Lightning continues to be obsessed with himself. It's a little problematic that he doesn't grow from movie to movie. Sterling should have started from the beginning as a bigger villain. Cruz's journey is a little rocky. Sometimes, she's gung-ho as a trainer but other times, she's completely scared. I look forward to have Lightning training new whippersnappers in future sequels. This idea could have achieved its goal a little better."
132,Cars 3,8,8 November 2017,A fun and motivating movie about working hard and adapting to change.,"***This review may contain spoilers*** So apparently a lot of people complaining about the movie, have no basic comprehension skills or any understanding of how to explain concepts to their kids. They just want their kids to see that you can win no matter what and even if you get old you will still always be the best.A lot of people are saying he was defeatist and ended up retiring. No. McQueen was on his way to winning the race and sacrificed his chance in order to give another car, who he saw potential in, the chance of a lifetime to try something they were good at. Secondly since he won the race by default through the other car, he is still able to and admits that he will continue racing.Also for the people going on and on about it being a female car. Who cares dude, it could have been a tiny boy car too. The plot would still have made the same point. Also they are cars.Moral of the story: Even at your best, sometimes you will still face hardships and others may end up being better than you. The best you can do is to learn, adapt and be open and supportive to others who may be equally as good. It is about learning how to handle competition and how to stay motivated and accepting of others when you are no longer at your peak.It teaches you how to stay classy and how to change and grow as a human. Not just finding a fancy new trick to win once again. It would have been more unrealistic if he just wins no matter what and no one can ever defeat him even in old age. I thought it was a brilliant learning experience for a child and considering so many millennials are going into depression because they are only now finding out that ''you can't be whatever you want to be and win'', I would say we should be having more movies teaching our kids this."
133,Cars 3,8,16 June 2017,Cars 3 manages to get back on track after a muddy start,"Cars 3 pulls ahead of 1 & 2 but it still can't pull ahead of Pixar's classics. The beginning of the movie was absolutely terrible, it was the same old same old start to a Cars movie, but it still makes up for it's lost ground. IKt really started to pick up at the 45 minute mark, you couldn't blink without missing something. Cruz was very ehh and kind of snarky in the beginning but she ended up becoming a very funny and likable character at the hour mark. Jackson was a pretty weak competitor he really wasn't a part of a lot of the movie. But at the hour and 15 min mark it was clear that Cars 3 was a good movie. Sadly it doesn't have the story or depth of a lot of the other Pixar classics but it still is the best addition to the Cars franchise. 1st quarter 4.5/10 2nd quarter 6/10 3rd quarter 8.5/10 4th quarter 9/10"
134,Cars 3,8,15 June 2017,Best Cars Film Yet!,"Cars 3 is a great new chapter in the Cars series. While it doesn't soar to the heights of other Pixar films, it still is the best Cars film yet.Cars 3 sees Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) undergo a series of losses and then a near fatal crash. His fellow racers are dropping out and being replaced by new, high tech cars like his rival Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer). McQueen realizes during his recovery that the game has changed and he's not the sharp rookie he used to be. He knows he needs to train harder than he ever has to keep doing what he loves. With the help of trainer Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), McQueen plans to beat Storm at an upcoming race in Florida to start off the season. This is his last chance to prove his worth to his fans and his new corporate sponsor (Nathan Fillion) and McQueen is not going down without a fight.My favorite character in Cars 3 is Cruz Ramirez. The reveal of a new car being added to Lightning's crew is exciting. This character's glowing positivity is a nice contrast to McQueen's snarky pessimism. Cristela Alonzo brings a lot of enthusiasm, but also plays the deeper sides of this character very well too and engages you in the evolution of Cruz Ramirez throughout the movie. The animation in Cars 3 is great. No other film succeeds in making everyday objects feel truly human as well as this franchise does. This gives it a sense of realism and puts me more in tune with characters' emotions and makes me care more about them in the process. The backgrounds in this film are gorgeous. They're detailed, picturesque and really reflect the quality of Pixar's animation. The total effect makes me envy the characters and wish I could visit them in their rich, colorful world. Preceding Cars 3 is the short film Lou about a creature made out of objects from a school lost-and-found bin. It's an interesting concept and carries an important message. It's one of my favorite Pixar shorts to date. I recommend Cars 3 for ages 5 to 12. The scene where Lightning McQueen crashes is quite intense and could scare younger children. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
135,Cars 3,9,16 June 2017,Third time's the charm!,"Cars (2006) was pretty good. Cars 2 (2011) was a total mess, but the third time's the charm for Lightning McQueen and company. I looked forward to this movie for a long time, watching and re-watching every trailer and clip. It was everything I hoped it would be and more. This movie has everything - nostalgia, conflict, a great story, a terrific soundtrack and plenty of homages to the original film. The only thing it's missing, strangely, is McQueen's famous catchphrases ""Ka-chow!"" and ""Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer"" (although variations of his ""I am speed"" monologue are there in abundance). Then again, this movie definitely has a more serious tone than the previous Cars films, so perhaps cheesy catchphrases would seem out of place. I certainly didn't miss them. The events of Cars 2 are not mentioned at all, which is a good thing if you ask me. Oh, and can I just mention how spectacular Pixar's graphics are these days? The best thing about this film, thought, is not that Lightning is a much more sympathetic character than he used to be (let's face it, he was pretty self- centered through most of Cars, and was barely in Cars 2 at all). Nor is it the fact that Mater, who we saw far too much of in Cars 2, is largely kept in the background for this film (and thank goodness!). He only features prominently in a few brief scenes, and for the first time since the first film, his comedy bits are actually funny. No, the best part of this film is a cheerful, spunky yellow sports car (she doesn't seem to be based on any real- life make and model, although she loosely resembles a Jaguar F-type) named Cruz Ramirez. She steals the show (in a good way) and I found myself rooting for her even more than McQueen. More than anything else, this movie is Cruz's story, and her character could even be seen as a feminist message of hope. It's no Wonder Woman, but Cars 3 certainly does more to help close the gender gap than its predecessors (in fact, one scene directly addresses sexism in the racing world, though it's not strictly about Cruz). A few moments even reminded me of another excellent sentient-race-car film, Herbie Fully Loaded (which I highly recommend, even if you're not a NASCAR fan). There's also a number of touching tributes to the late Doc Hudson, whose character arc in the first film is clearly echoed in parts of McQueen's journey in this one. Rusty and Dusty, who were voiced by the Car Talk guys in the first film, are in this one as well, although, since one of them died, his character doesn't say much (although what few lines he does have are expertly edited together, seemingly from old Car Talk recordings, the same way Doc's lines were derived from Paul Newman's voice recordings left over from Cars). The only real downside to Cars 3 is that it doesn't work very well as a standalone film. While you could get the overall gist of it if you've never seen Cars, it works much better when thought of as a continuation of the first film. If I were watching the trilogy for the first time, I would watch Cars and Cars 3 back-to- back, skipping Cars 2 (it contributes nothing relevant to the time line, and if you're really in love with the Cars universe, you can always go back and watch it later.) TLDR: Cars 3 was better than either of the two previous films. Watch the first Cars if you haven't already, then go see Cars 3. It rocks!"
136,Cars 3,8,19 June 2017,Enjoyable for all ages,"I have a general love for animation, but I usually let my child dictate opinions on these type movies. He loved it. I liked it. The animation itself was beautiful to behold. I saw it at a drive-in which is evening more impressive because it wasn't the best screen. I was amazed at what Pixar is able to do with their animation. The pavement and water looked awesome. The story was decent. There was a ""twist"" of sorts at the end that I thought was cute. All in all it was a decent addition to the Cars line up. The kids will enjoy it. I enjoyed some of the humor. Its not funny like Archer, but I wouldn't let my six year old watch Archer either. Have some popcorn and enjoy."
137,Cars 3,8,19 June 2017,Cars 3 Review:  Back On Track,"Cars 3 Review: Back On Track By - Ed Buskirk Editor: Disney Movie DatabaseFrom This Moment, Everything Will Change...but in a good way!Okay so I added the last few words, but it holds true. If my memory holds true, Cars 3 was announced at D23 two years ago. The announcement of a new Cars film was met with lukewarm response at best. It was slated to come out a year from now in 2018. Somewhere along the way, Toy Story 3 got bumped back, and Cars got pushed forward. Naturally, I was hoping that this would be a good film. Full disclosure, the original and its sequel held a special place in the heart of my family, and myself. I became skeptical as the six month mark approached. We had seen very little advertising, and what we did see was met with mixed emotion. I became very worried, when we did not see any more advertising for quite a while, then the first real trailer dropped. My fears began to dissipate. As the marketing machine turned up, my apprehension turned down. In the past weeks we have seen some really good marketing for this film, and I don't say that often. For the Animated properties, I just don't feel that they do a great job advertising, but maybe as the tag line says ""from this moment, everything will change"".In Cars 3, we catch up with Lightning at the top of his career, and he loves what he does. Things are changing for Lightning, his sponsor has been sold to a new owner, his friends are being forced out of of their positions as race team leaders to make way for the younger racers, and the sport is changing around him. Along comes the newer and faster, Jackson Storm, rocking McQueen's world, and making him doubt himself resulting in a near career ending crash. In order to reclaim his spot as the leader of his team, and his own confidence, Lightning sets off on a cross country journey, as a last ditch effort to find a way to beat Storm with his new trainer Cruz Ramirez.Getting back to its roots, Director Brian Fee, keeps his focus on Lightning through the changes he has to make or be pushed out of the career he loves. Cars becomes a very adult story about career changes, and trying to stay at the top of your game. This is a story filled with heart, and moral lessons. The antagonist in this story are not really ""bad guys"" they just have different agendas than our heroes, and our heroes have to learn to overcome the obstacles that they never could have seen coming. The story takes some unexpected, but always pleasant detours and feels fresh and exciting. That is quite an accomplishment for a franchise that seemed to have lost its footing. I am pleased to say that this film lives up to its Pixar pedigree.There are a couple of minor complaints with the film. I did not feel that the soundtrack from Randy Newman was as inspired as his first score, and there was no stand-out ""McQueen and Sally"" moment in the score for me. I may feel different upon multiple viewings, In the first film McQueen and Sally race each other through the area surrounding radiator springs, and the music is wonderful. It swells to a crescendo when the road takes a turn and you get the reveal of a waterfall. This movies score was just lacking one of those musical moments. My only other complaint if there was one, was the story arc of our antagonists. One seemed to kind of make a sudden change, and one felt like it did not wrap up to me. As important as this may sound, the film stayed focused where it needed to, and the stories we were invested in were the ones that received all the concentration, and the attention they deserved.As with any Pixar film, it cannot go without saying that the visuals are mind blowing and worth viewing the film for at least a couple of times. I cannot wait to get this movie home and pour over the details that the animators packed into every frame.The Summer movie season is crowded, and I for one know how expensive an investment it can be to take your family to the movie. However I do not have any reservations about recommending this movie to you. Its well worth your time and effort.Score 8.2 out of 10"
138,Cars 3,7,18 June 2017,"Instead of slowing down or crashing and burning, this entry to Pixar's Cars manages to be a smooth enough ride.","Cars 3 is the latest entry to Pixar's Cars franchise. The movie features the return of Lightning McQueen as he's much older, yet he continues racing, and as he does so, many rookies come in and steal the show. When McQueen gets the urge to beat Jackson Storm, his current rival, he ends up crashing and he needs to make the decision to either retire or continue his racing career.Now going in I didn't expect anything huge. I wasn't impressed with the trailers, I think the Cars movies are some of the weakest Pixar films. The original Cars was below average for Pixar standards and the second one was awful from the get-go. When I went to see this movie, I was somewhat surprised to see that it could very well be the best of the three entries of the franchise. I was really pleased to see that this entry holds a heavier focus on racing. The franchise focuses on a race car and it was very refreshing to see that since racing wasn't necessarily the focus of the last two films. The first Cars focused more on slowing down and enjoying the view and the second one had a heavy focus on a spy plot...and Mater. Speaking of Mater, he doesn't get that much screen time here as most of the Radiator Springs crew members don't either, which gives us time to learn more about our new characters. The new characters can range from being either interesting like Cruz Ramirez to not very well fleshed out, which I'll get to later in this review. I will say this though, this is the first time Lightning McQueen felt like a fully realized character. His goal felt believable, which helped make the movie feel more engaging than the previous two. Something I like about the movie is how it takes some time to answer a few questions about the world of Cars, even if it is still a confusing one. The movie offers some dazzling visuals, which is to be expected from Pixar. From the backgrounds to the character animation, Pixar shows us that they're able to deliver some beautiful visuals.Even if this might be the best Cars film, it still comes with some flaws. The story does feel very generic and it feels like it has been done before. Not to mention that the movie does feel like it drags during a few points. Along with the story being a bit generic, I also found it a bit predictable. Jackson Storm, the primary antagonist also didn't feel fully realized and felt like a forgettable character. His entire character is set around beating McQueen and I can't even remember his motivation for doing so clearly.Even with Cars 3's flaws, it still felt like an enjoyable ride. It's probably the closest of the three to feeling like an actual Pixar movie. It feels somewhat refreshing for a bumpy franchise, even despite the fact that it does keep some of its flaws that its predecessors had.7/10"
139,Cars 3,10,13 November 2017,The Best story but not for kid!,"This is the BEST story ever among all series, but yes this story is NOT for children. The children will not understand how the world works when the young replace the old and the old are supposed to give space and support the youth. This is the fact, how good the old but they cannot beat the youth in term of physical matter. Cars film tells about the athlete's life when the senior have to retire when they get old. It's normal but children cannot accept this easily of course. It will make them down! And Disney failed to bring this story more interesting for children. Even the new yellow car character is lack of charisma compared to McQueen.However, I'm impressed when Disney tried to capture modernization era and they called it as ""Future"". The fact that Disney brought McQueen to his old age it makes the movie more realistic. When the viewer watch this movie since the beginning and they grew up so the story won't be a huge problem. But yeah, this is not good at all for children who watch Cars in a raw, we can say ""Movie Marathon"" as these children haven't grown up yet."
140,Cars 3,7,4 November 2017,"not a perfect film, but a perfect ending","I watched this movie without much expectation after the 2nd one, but in the end, it turned out to be better than I expected. In the first movie, McQueen has gone through a great transformation, from a young racer full of passion but also vanity to a calm, thoughtful and respectable one. We have Doc Houston to thank for that. Then again, in the third movie, he has gone through a second major transformation, something you may experience at your 40s. He is lost, desperate and has no clue how to carry on. Yet, in the dark time, he found hope, not the way he imagined but way much more. He realizes who he is right now, what can he do, and what he should do. If the first movie is about McQueen realizing the meaning of life, this one is about he building his own legacy, just like his respectable mentor Doc Houston. And now, his life is complete. The visual are awesome, the scene are good and the old folks are charming in their own way even though the story are not quite natural as the first one. Every bit of the movie is a reference to the legendary Houston Hornet, and to help me visualize the future Lightning McQueen. It is the time for our beloved champion to take a step back, enjoy his life with pride and leave the spotlight for younger racers. In movie, I feel like Pixar has gone back to its root: making a ""feel train"" instead of summer super hero movie (yep, I'm talking about the 2nd one). Life is never easy or hard, it just the way it is. Sometime you are lost, stumble, but you will get back on your feet and move on. Sometime, things have to change and you can not keep them the way they are, you have to accept it. And once accept it, you 'll find out that you have earned something instead of losing, you 've become a better person that you can be proud of. This is the perfect ending for Lightning McQueen. I 'd give this movie a 7 out of 10. definitely watch it again."
141,Cars 3,9,1 November 2017,More Than a Rocky vs Drago Story Line,"(Flash Review)I was impressed not only with the spectacular animation quality (I really do think some of the dirt backgrounds were real footage with animation layered on top) but also with the depth of the story. It was certainly a tale with more obvious morals for kids than with Cars 2 where little kids probably aren't old enough to care about environment vs big oil issues. Cars 3 focused on character, not giving up and consideration for others. The core of the plot was that a new era of racers have become more dominant then the last era's models causing some older racers to retire. These new racers have advanced training and technology at their disposal. How will McQueen response to the new challenge? For those familiar with Rocky vs the technically trained and younger Drago, the story line will appear familiar with McQueen looking to his roots for his advantage. However, the writers put in a heartwarming twist to their story. There were many fun scenes, good character development (maybe some new character merchandise) and a thoughtful story. More appropriate to younger kids than the last movie."
142,Cars 3,7,28 October 2017,Just as good as the first one (a short review),"What we liked about the first one (and not the second) was the simplicity and innocence in the story with a good heart and intention made for younger audience. This installment carries all that, one might say this is the sequel the original cars movie deserved. The themes this movie carries is very much similar to the original and at times feels like you are watching the first movie itself with certain characters switching places, but nevertheless its much better than the last one and worthy of a sequel. And as always Pixar's animation is beautiful to watch.Verdict: Worthy of existence."
143,Cars 3,9,27 October 2017,The Franchise hasn't run out of gas!,"I love Pixar films. Movies like Toy Story and Monsters Inc create stories with characters we admire and love. Now after two movies, it's time for Cars to have its third and final film.The big question was lingering on mine and everyone else's mind: How do you create a third Cars movie after that second one? Don't get me wrong, I loved the second movie and it's plot and flashy atmosphere, but it had a lot of bugs under its hood. Cars 3 goes back to its roots and focuses back on Lightning McQueen as he faces off against the new movie antagonist Jackson Storm (A.K.A Chick Hicks 2.0) Finally, after an action spy flick that should've been rated PG, we get a Cars movie about racing again!The way they brought back Doc Hudson and had the storytelling and feel of the first really shines in this movie, I love the characters. It also gives a good laugh and I smile through 98% of the movie. The cherry on top is that Mater is back to his old self! Same Silly old Mater, no spy guns, no sudden intelligence and no girlfriend! Just like Toy Story 3, Cars 3 shows us that this franchise can still pull off an emotion filled blockbuster. This movie proves the franchise hasn't run out of gas! If you loved the first Cars film, watch this one. You will not regret it, I promise."
144,Cars 3,7,26 October 2017,A great ending for cars,There is a lot of bad reviews for this movie and i don't even get if people understood what was going on in the movie. Lots of people talk about taking their younger sons in the cinema and etc. The movie was made for the generation that saw the movie 11 years ago. Most of those people are grown ups now. The movie show the ending of the great story of Lightning McQueen. The graphics where awesome for an animated movie some parts of the crashing of Lightning McQueen felt real and the story was breathtaking. Its a happy ending for Lightning McQueen.
145,Cars 3,10,25 October 2017,"Despite Having A ""Flat Tire."" Cars 3 Takes The Checkered Flag This Year (includes Spoilers)","For more than 20 years, Pixar Animation Studios has produced several of different classics. Some are excellent films with in-depth storytelling, like Toy Story 3 and Inside Out. Others have upset the critics and the box office records, like Cars 2. Well, Cars 3, however, fits this category of a ""fresh"" Pixar movie. After the mediocre sequel Cars 2, Pixar decided to step up this franchise's game by pitching a third entry. The movie studio also realized that die-hards of the series would enjoy the third movie being more in tune with the original. The extensive advertising that went into the film, all featuring the crash of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), the veteran racing champion, was targeted more towards adult viewers. Unfortunately, the film appealed more towards younger viewers. Cars 2 grabbed adults more because there was a massive spy subplot incorporated into the film, which threw the franchise off-track. As the film progresses the chemistry between Lightning McQueen and Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), McQueen's high-tech trainer, develops from total strangers to close friends. During the final race, for example, McQueen sacrifices his position in the race to give Ramirez her chance to win her first Piston Cup championship. While this sounds very heroic, the reality is that National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) rookies must enter the rookie division to compete in national championships. However, Cars 3 makes an exception to the reality because this is an entertaining, children's film, not a documentary on how to become a race car driver and retire. Although this is a poignant story about retirement and learning from elders, Cars 3 still manages to be defined as a comedy and family- friendly film. Almost no one was expecting a happy ending to a movie where the main character nearly dies in the teaser trailer. The overall tone makes the targeted audience feel welcome and glad to have attended an incredible film. Randy Newman's score transformed the movie from a sad drama to a happy, fun comedy, using themes from the original, including ""The Big Race"" which is nostalgic for many people. Although it surpasses Cars 2 is storytelling, the film almost saved this flat- tired animated franchise, but, in the end, does not match the high standards of Cars. Cars 3 is the perfect example of how a sequel should be constructed and created, using nostalgic scores and kid-friendly jokes for audiences of all ages to laugh. While animated ""threequels"" like Shrek the Third and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs are charming comedies for fellow audiences, only Cars 3 produces comedy, drama, and nostalgia for audiences of all ages."
146,Cars 3,10,19 September 2017,Haters Can Die In A Fire,Cars 3 is the best movie all the haters are just losers with no social life's because this movie is awesome so all the haters can be idiots on this movie cars 3 is the best movie Haters can die in fire this movie is so awesome my little brother liked this movie and my family like this movie so lets settle this Cars (2006) 10/10 Cars 2 (2012) 5/10 Cars 3 (2017) 10/10 So That's It So Haters Can Die In A Fire
147,Cars 3,7,11 September 2017,"Though not the best, still good","I thought the Cars movies were alright, being about talking cars and just racing and zooming around. Still, I saw this anyway and was impressed. Though I've seen a ton of CGI movies, I was blown away by the CGI in this one. The voice acting was good (trust me; I've heard bad voicing in the past) and plot well-done, even though you could predict the end. Speaking of the ending, though, it didn't make much sense to me. The problem wasn't quite fully fixed.The movie, in my opinion, was better than the second (where cars, which are basically people, were being smashed and murdered) but impossible to live up to the first. It's a nice movie that is worth watching."
148,Cars 3,6,14 July 2017,He's still Lightning fast,"*** (3/5)YOU HAVE TO credit the creativity team at Pixar's animation studios for sticking to the Cars series, ever since it first hit the road in 2006 it was seen as their first mediocre hit, it didn't stop them, however because merchandising was through the roof, this goes for the box-office totalling at a $462 million worldwide gross and in addition earning a couple of Oscar nods in the process. This success of theirs was short-lived as they tried their hands at a Bond-esque premise in Cars 2, which was a fresh idea which sadly executed badly.The series is back and there's a silver lining for the series, its back on the race track with new director Brian Fee who's a veteran at the studio in the art department for WALL-E and Ratatouille, as a director Cars 3 is his first. It opens promisingly with the speedy show-runner Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) sporting his typical red & yellow lightning shard combo, in a winning montage at the Piston Cup, it has the typical Pixar feel there's a running of the characters, there are new additions to the series. McQueen is blindsided by a new generation of smarter, faster and shinier racers which threaten to end his run as the best racer in the world. There's a new rivalry for him to face with rookie racer Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer), who's miles faster than McQueen, he's better looking with all the mod-cons he is determined that he's the fastest racer in the world. However, McQueen undeterred wants to take over him to prove he's still the best.Story-wise it's back in solid race territory that made the first movie golden, there's an interaction with all his old friends one in particular his best friend the slurred voiced hillbilly tow-truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). It's a feel-good premise for Pixar to return to, it's funny, at least a better, funnier and a sharper improvement over its predecessor. It's darker than its predecessors too, there's a moment when the lead is hurt that will have you balling. He won't be beaten as he wills himself train harder, try better, and will stronger to get back on the track. He enters a training program lead by his eccentric trainer Cruz (Cristela Alonzo), who treats him like an old man she takes it easy on him. The run goes smoothly for a while, until sadly there's a bump in the road the jokes become predictable it's particularly Mater that hits this streak his jokes are generic and can be seen coming from a mile away they fail to reach the first lap. There are a few moments that feel unwelcome; one moment that stands out is the meeting with his snobbish sponsor Sterling (Nathan Fillion), who turns him into a brand  perhaps as a reference to McQueen's merchandise in the Disney stores. This feels sadly generic and slows down the usually racy pace of these films. The film shines in its heartfelt storytelling and the richer animation style, there are more spectacular moments (a memorable dirt race section). There are emotional moments too, thanks to timely flashbacks of McQueen's old mentor Doc Hudson (the late Paul Newman). So, prepare the tissues. Cars 3 may not be the best in the series, and it's still a far cry from Pixar greatness, yet this offers a more heartfelt story and richer animation than the film's predecessor to give a better, smoother and funnier drive for the last in the trilogy. There's a lot to enjoy here that will get you balling and give you feel-good vibes, so fasten your seatbelts he's still lightning fast... VERDICT: An exceedingly polished kid-friendly animation that offers a heartfelt story and richer animation, yet still a far-cry from Pixar greatness."
149,Cars 3,7,17 June 2017,Quite an improvement,"I'm not the biggest fan of the ""Cars"" franchise, but it's very easy to say that ""Cars 2"" was the worst Pixar movie ever made. I mean, none of the other ones come even close. This is a massive improvement because of one major thing. The previous movie had the annoying Mater as the main character instead of Lightning McQueen! Now we have him in the background as the comic relief where he belongs. There are some quite funny parts in this. I especially like when Lightning is on the simulator and he's on fire. Well, literally I mean. Now there is another problem this film runs into. It does kind of focus too much on the character Cruz.Cruz is actually a very enjoyable character but I don't think they end it on a very good note. She does seem to get too powerful too quickly. Still, this film had the voice of none other than Castle himself, Nathan Fillion! Okay, this guy is probably my favorite actor right now. I have made fun of celebrity voices, but this guy has an amazing voice and I love hearing it over and over again. There's one part where Lightning says he isn't a sellout. Was it trying to make a joke about how ""Cars"" has made a massive amount of money with its merchandise (10 billion dollars!)? Or it is just hypocritical? ***"
150,Cars 3,8,17 June 2017,Worth my time and money to watch,"Rate it 8 out of 10. Great philanthropy expressed in this movie. Dream it. Then believe it. Well worth the watch, and the 3rd installment adds much needed value and heart to the series. I've been waiting to watch Cars 3 ever since I saw the trailer 6 months or so ago. I loved the concept / purpose and how it lit the fire within myself. I had a choice to watch the well-reviewed Wonder Woman movie, however I picked Cars 3 because I felt it related to me much more."
151,Cars 3,9,27 August 2017,Just Brilliant,"I loved this film, great entertainment, great graphics, great sound effects, great visual effects, great plot, great sequel, funny, moving towards the end, a shame that the Hudson Hornet died great story great racing great car design, this film has everything Cars and Cars 2 had, apart from the Hudson Hornet brilliant family entertainment."
152,Cars 3,9,24 August 2017,Solid and funny good sequel,This movie was so much better than cars 2 because mater didn't have as much screen time which made it good and worth the time when you see it but this is a very funny movie with everyone calling lightning mc queen old and he is the one still there because all the newe young cars are faster than him and it also shows that women can race to and one thing I wasn't expecting was that it was surprisingly emotional and sad at times but I think that the first cars movie slightly beats by not far
153,Cars 3,,25 June 2017,not bad but not really needed,"You can't beat the clockthat's the central theme of this sequel which finds an aging Lightning McQueen in the twilight of his racing years and unexpectedly derailed by a new generation of younger and faster cars. Still convinced that he has a lot left in his tank, McQueen decides to explore some new, innovative training methods to keep up with his youthful competition, but will that be enough to keep him in the game? Has more depth and emotional resonance than Cars 2 (thanks in large part to the presence of Doc Hudson), along with a colorful cast of characters and some truly laugh-out loud moments, it's just never really awe-inspiring, and never seems truly necessary. Fortunately, a short running time keeps it from wearing out its welcome. **½"
154,Cars 3,9,16 June 2017,Greatest movie of the Cars trilogy,"Cars 3 is a great movie with realistic animation (as realistic as talking cars can get), fascinating storytelling, real emotions and a surprising ending. For now, I consider this movie the greatest of the Cars movies. This is a story that we will all one day experience, and that makes this masterpiece even better."
155,Cars 3,7,9 July 2017,"A Good, Decent Film","+JMJ+I thought Cars 3 was a good movie. From the parental stance and view, there is no cursing or foul language except ""heck"" mildly being exclaimed twice during a race and ""butt"" a few times in reference to a car's back end. I loved the flashbacks to the late Doc Hudson, otherwise referred to as the Fabulous Hudson Hornet. It was interesting that Mater and the rest of the gang from Radiator Springs had roles that were significantly less active than in either of the previous two animated films.Cars 3 is majorly focused on Lightning McQueen. Like many main characters in animated movies, McQueen is slightly egotistical. He seems to be solely worried about his racing career which appears to be declining. Gradually, however, he starts caring more for others around him. McQueen's character has always struggled with looking beyond his own desires. But at the end of Cars 3, McQueen helps a new friend Cruz to attain her biggest dream. A personal annoyance was Cristela Alonzo's squealing when her character Cruz was frightened or excited. From a critic's point of view, Randy Newman's music for the film was very similar to many other past Disney movies including Up's scores which were composed by Michael Giacchino. But overall it was a pretty enjoyable film."
156,Cars 3,9,9 July 2017,And a bang!  Cars is back,"The Cars series has a strong resemblance to the Patriots in the SuperBowl 51.. the build up wasn't looking too good after the choke of Cars 2 (ain't nobody got time for that) but then Cars 3 made a hella comeback to clutch the win. Cars 3 was that catch by Edelman, that dive by White, that winning touchdown. Can't describe the feeling except snap crackle pop, we have a winner, chicken dinner."
157,Cars 3,6,6 July 2017,"It worked again, in that inimitable Cars way","I always have to get past my ""but who built the cars"" skepticism before I can settle in and watch a Cars or Planes movie. It's like listening to Shakespeare being performed. Give me 10 minutes and I'm into it.That was the same with this iteration of Cars. Everything is familiar, yet the plots always surprise. And there is a generous dose of humility, love, and tenderness that these movies consistently deliver.The kids in my life are getting older now. I don't how long it will be before they'll be wanting to see their own movies. But that I get to enjoy these movies with them just enhances the experience and my memory of these precious moments."
158,Cars 3,8,16 July 2017,Great movie about becoming a parent and Female Empowerment,"As I sit here, in my mid 30's, raising two children, I find myself in an interesting place with regards my work/life balance. I'm a military helicopter pilot but it's getting harder to deploy for long periods at a time; my parental social life is worlds away from that of the young single junior pilots. In short, I'm not the speediest race car on the track anymore.I've entered a period in my life when you start to question what defines you. That debonair Ray-Ban wearing military pilot is an identity I have owned for well over a decade; but will I be that guy in another ten years? If not, then who will I be?*Spolier* Lightning McQueen isn't the coolest, fastest car in this movie. Not by a long shot. As he faces the constant march of aging he is forced to confront what life might be like without racing as his identity. In a pivotal scene he returns to the town that Smokey (Doc Hudson's mentor) is from and learns that his feelings are exactly the same as Docs were. He's experiencing what happens to all racers, athletes, people, when their lives begin to drift away from their initial passions. Smokey describes how Doc withdrew, couldn't handle life without racing, until one day he started writing letters home. Smokey opens the garage door and pinned to the wall are 100's of newspaper clippings of Doc and his young mentee, Lightning McQueen.""Doc didn't love racing again, Lightning, he loved you"".Maybe it's the Dadblogger in me but I was reading father/child relationship ALL over that, much like the tears that were all over my face as my son cuddled up to me in the cinema seats.Lightning McQueen is coming to the realisation that all cartoon cars eventually come to: that the act of parenting/mentoring others to succeed far surpasses the feelings of egotistical pride that individual personal success provides.In Cars 1 he learnt about humility, in Cars 2 he learnt about friendship, and now he's learning about selflessness. If this isn't the story arc of every father I know then I'll hang up my blogging boots right now!"
159,Cars 3,7,16 July 2017,best of the Cars franchise,"I'm surprised by how many poor reviews this film is getting. Cars 2 was pretty weak - and that's not saying the first Cars was that great anyway. But Cars 3 is definitely in a class above. The atmospherics are great - check the heat haze during the early race scenes - as are the backgrounds: flowers, grass, peeling paint, etc. The cars look great, and the animation is top notch (of course).I'm not much of a fan of the secondary characters in any of the films - many are annoying at best (especially Mater); for me it's always been about building a relationship between the leads - McQueen and Doc Hudson in the first, and now McQueen and his trainer Cruz. Their relationship is built up slowly and we become invested in them as we should. Issues of personal responsibility and maturity were explored in the first Cars and that's continued in this story as well.It's not a basic kid's movie to be consumed and forgotten like an ice cream; it's a family movie with depth and re-watchability; best of all we're asked to get behind and support Cruz and McQueen as they make their way through to the final reel. That's different from just watching the tale unfold with the final denouement never in doubt.Toy Story 3 was poignant, it had pathos; we really felt for the toys and we wondered if they were going to make it out 'alive' - but they were dolls with proper facial expressions (and the viewer's inner belief in their own dolls' personalities) to aid the script, so getting a similar result from the normally inanimate vehicles of Cars 3 is quite an achievement.Cars 3 isn't up there with any of the Toy Story series, but it's still pretty good. Plus the pre-show short of LOU is an enjoyable opener in the Luxo Jnr mold."
160,Cars 3,8,14 July 2017,An action packed adventure filled with development and humor,"Lightning McQueen is back in the 3rd installment of the Cars franchise. This movie sees a huge array of newcomers take center stage and swarm the piston cup taking over the place of veteran racers in favor of new ""next generation"" racers that would become the competitions new roster as veteran racers become replaced one by one. Questioning his ability to perform as a racer after a drastic accident lightning McQueen begins to train under Rusteze's new high tech training center provided by billionaire fan and McQueens new sponsor Sterling. Its here McQueen meets Cruz his personal trainer in order to get McQueen up to shape and able to beat newcomer Jackson Storm who is no pun intended taking the racing world by storm.McQueens journey to improve takes him to Thunder Hollow where things take a rather erratic turn and begin to get crazy fast. Alongside his personal trainer Cruz, McQueen pays a visit to Smokey (Hudson Hornets trainer) in the hopes of getting some much required training. While McQueen is able to get training slowly he begins to realize that change is an inevitable part of life and watches newcomer Cruz Ramirez slowly develop into a fully fledged racer. This movies overall focus is not about McQueen simply winning races this is about his development as a character. Winning is the one thing a champion lives on McQueen is no exception lets not let that derive us from the fact that with this change in competition McQueen has to improve or adapt to that change and accept retirement and this is where the message of the movie kicks in. Winning isn't everything and change is inevitable so many ""die hard fans"" appeared to have missed this. Ontop of that so many of the films target demographic simply could not accept the change."
161,Cars 3,8,13 July 2017,"interesting movie, different from previous Cars movies","I have read most of the 2-star reviews and I think most of them lose the main point of the movie which I think is the meaning of the new cars. I love Cars 1 and liked very much Cars 2. The soundtracks are perfect for the movies and music seems to be very important in terms of the history. I believe this new Cars 3 lacks a bit of the music side of the previous. But, I believe this movie has a different view and has a bit a the taste of Toy Story 3, the nostalgia and the remembrance of the past are the main point of those last two movies. I really enjoyed and my wife did so. My children of 4 yo liked also, maybe a bit slow for their age. My 11 and 14 yo liked the movie very much. I agreed in many topics of the movie and honor the American car history in many ways. I recommend the movie for most parents, especially for middle-age children."
162,Cars 3,7,11 July 2017,"Honestly, I think people missed the point.","I think fair to say that Cars is probably the Pixar Franchise that's loved the least on their roster. You have fans of the first movie, but most people have it on the bottom of their favorites list I notice. I rarely have heard anyone say they liked Cars 2 because I for sure didn't, and I loved the first one. This movie is miles better than Cars 2 (no pun intended) I don't see how anyone can argue that. I'm not going to talk about the corporate monger that produces these for the sake of selling toys because we all know these movies do, I'm reviewing the movie as a movie and as a Pixar one especially. This one at least brought back that classic American feel you get from the first movie. McQueen learns a new lesson, and it ends the story in a way that makes sense. People are only arguing it's not a worthy ending because they had expectations and wanted things to play out a certain way, but again they miss the point of what McQueen learns by the end of the film. Yes he wanted to race one last time, but the point was he had to give someone else their chance to follow their dreams via Cruz. The imagery of new drivers and technology that's beyond McQueen's generation continued to show him that his racing days were numbered and that he must make the realization that he'll grow old out of it just like everyone else. By following the training steps of Doc Hudson he learned that Doc's greatest joy in life wasn't just racing, but it was being McQueen's mentor and passing on his knowledge to a new generation. That's essentially what the film goes for, it concludes the story in a Rocky III sort of way and it works. This movie was made for the fan of the first Cars who appreciated it for scenes like when Sally showed McQueen the history of Route 66, with James Taylor playing in the background. If you appreciated the first movie like I did because of Paul Newman's performance as Doc and his relationship with McQueen then you're going to love this film. There's a certain emotional resonance it has with that relationship and they digitally recreate Paul Newman's role in a poignant way. As a movie for kids I would say if they really like Cars 1-2 they will most likely enjoy this one as well. If they sorta like the other two then I would say pass. The pacing is different from other animated films and it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. That's why they have films like Despicable me 3 which require less attention and deliver more cutesy animation because some people think that's satisfying enough. In comparison to other Pixar films I would say I enjoyed it more than Finding Dory and Monsters University. But I liked it more on the level of the Good Dinosaur. It's serviceable, but not great. You go for certain elements like the animation. The visuals in this movie are beautiful. In a similar way like the Good Dinosaur, the way they did the forests and the beaches I really felt like I wasn't watching an animated movie. I think Pixar's in a creative phase where they have many original ideas they're working on but it's not ready to start producing within the next 3 years henceforth why we're getting all these sequels. I understand Coco is suppose to release later this year and I'm really looking forward to that. Cars 3, not the best animated movie I've seen this year, but it's an entertaining one. It might not be the right movie for newcomers who haven't seen the first one at least but I recommend it for people who enjoy the first for the reasons I did."
163,Cars 3,9,10 July 2017,Great way to end the franchise!,"I saw this movie with my sister and we thought that this was an awesome way to end the Cars Trilogy! The plot was so inspirational for me to say the least. As well as a wonderful set of elements that made this a great family film! When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was on hype overload. For me being a huge Cars fan, I thought that it was worth it!!! If you get the chance, catch it! if you don't, you will regret it later!"
164,Cars 3,7,29 June 2017,"Hit with the kids, so-so to me","Lightning McQueen is no longer a young stud, he's got a lot of wear on his tires and a lot of mileage on his engine. Early on he finds out that newer, younger, sleeker more streamlined vehicles are the future in racing.Cars 3, while good, was a lot slower than I expected. I can't remember if the first two installments were as slow but this sequel certainly seemed more deliberate. It was less funny, light and witty than I thought it'd be. Of course there was a good message--or should I say several good messages--but that is to be expected from a Disney film. Also, I don't know if it was just the theater we were in but there seemed to be a sound quality problem. Part of me was thinking that the sound was somewhat low on purpose because of the ages of the audience and the other part of me thought that the theater just did a poor job with the sound of the movie.Hey, but forget about me, I'm a grizzled adult. My kids liked it and that's what really matters."
165,Cars 3,8,29 June 2017,"Pixar, Inc., tries to give NASCAR some advice on how to salvage . . .",". . . an entertainment product already in universally acknowledged decline and teetering on the Abyss with the imminent retirement of most of its ""Glory Years"" stars. Pixar's CARS 3 bestows more than mere lip service upon the so-called Fair Sex. When CARS 1 & 2 Hero Lightning McQueen (#95) finally sees the light and recognizes that his stymied Trainer Chick Cruz's pent-up enthusiasm for racing AND WINNING after she bests him in a practice run is as authentic as Brandi Chastain whipping off her jersey to celebrate a soccer victory, Lightning turns over his ride to Ms. Cruz toward the end of a big race and her path to a NASCAR triumph for the Womenfolk glides forward on Cruise Control from there. Now that Danica Patrick's Fiancé Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. has won at Talladega, the NASCAR Powers-that-Be MUST insure that Ricky's car is within shouting distance of the lead during the final pit stop at next year's Daytona 500 (which Danica could be sitting out on some pretext, such as Pregnancy). THEN, at this critical juncture, Ricky could feign a cramp, Danica could slip into his driver's seat, and worm her way through the field to take the Checkered Flag! This would not only allow Danica to burn her Drawerful of Green Participation Ribbons, but also give NASCAR a big boost in the butt!"
166,Cars 3,7,25 June 2017,Fun Disposable Family Entertainment,"I probably risk nothing in saying the Cars (2006-Present) universe and its interchangeable characters are the least interesting in Pixar's stable. More often than not the ensemble learns nothing from their adventures, and any lessons that the audience can gleam from under the hood is drowned out by the the franchise's incessant chirpiness. Yet if we close our eyes and pretend Cars is not part of the same studio that brought us Toy Story (1995), WALL-E (2008) and Up (2009), you might just realize that the whole enterprise is actually kind of okay. Cars is by no means great as there are enough problems within three movies to drive a truck through but they're not exactly Maximum Overdrive (1986) either.Cars 3, the latest installment in the toy fran...I mean film franchise, pits #95 Lightning McQueen (Wilson) against a new glut of next-generation racers. Finding himself consistently outmatched by the new up-and-comers, fronted by incredulous showboat Jackson Storm (Hammer) McQueen and his pit crew decide to bet his racing future on an array of cutting-edge training techniques.Its funny how the narrative arc of Cars 3 feels at once smart and fun while remaining pretty paint-by-the-numbers. Director Brian Fee and his army of screenwriters no doubt sat in a room trying to figure out how to continue this thing and all simultaneously thought to themselves, ""hey, don't these character basically line up with nearly every sports movie? Why don't we just do that?"" Thus Cars 3 grabs your attention, largely holds it throughout, and delivers on its themes in predictably effective and ultimately satisfying ways.With a narrative built on a solid foundation, Cars 3 indulges in some fun, that's one part demographic appeasement and one part apology tour. In one sequence McQueen and his trainer Cruz Ramirez (Alonzo) take part in a rough and tumble destruction derby. In another, the pair drive through an alpine forest imagining themselves as runaway bootleggers. New late-addition characters while never given no time to gel, nevertheless enhance the film's folksy appeal. Then of course there's Mater (Cable Guy) who's participation in this film is limited to one day in the sound booth (thank god). All of this points to a series that is willing to learn from its mistakes while still being true to what made it appealing.Now the question becomes, is Cars 3 up to Pixar's standards i.e. being a clever, emotionally resonant and effortlessly timeless classic. Umm, no, not even close. That said if you're looking for a movie that will entertain the kids for a few hours and possibly dull dad's obsolescence anxiety then this movie may just be one for you."
167,Cars 3,7,21 June 2017,"Looks great, but...","At the narrative arc of Pixar's ""Cars 3"", racecar Lightning McQueen, voiced by whimsical Owen Wilson, asks racecar trainer Cruz Ramirez, voiced by earnest Cristela Alonzo, to join him to find legendary racing mentor Smokey, voiced by sage Chris Cooper. Cruz is McQueen's hired trainer to get him back into winning racing form, following his devastating crash. Cruz grew up watching McQueen win. He is her hero. Being the female racecar in the ""men's club"" racing circuit, her dreams of becoming a racer might never be. Thus, she settles to be a trainer. She tells Lightning, ""I wanted to be you!"" Director Brian Fee's ""Cars 3"" has noble intentions, and the great message about legacy and mortality albeit about talking animated cars. His great aspirations along with his army of writers fail somewhat in the big picture. ""Cars 3"" is state-of-the-art spectacular animation and CGI. However, the screenplay by Kiel Murray, Bob Peterson, and Mike Rich based on the story of many including Fee is unfocused and lacks the profound sentimentality to overcome and enroll. The late Paul Newman reappears as the voice of Doc Hudson, Lightning's mentor. Although, Doc had long passed away in this story, he is the theme of the story. ""Cars 3"" follows McQueen as he finds Doc's Sensei so he can train to beat New Age analytics driven racecar Jackson Storm, voiced by comically arrogant Armie Hammer. At best ""Cars 3"" is about love and fostering greatness, and passing the baton to the next generation. Wilson and Alonzo do their best to move and inspire. However, at least for me the eyes of the ""Cars"" characters can illicit only a limited range of emotion and compassion. I think ""Car 3"" wanted to be an elegy about love and passing on greatness to future generations. Our hearts can be only be touched so much by the eyes of talking ""Cars"". This may be the tragic flaw of the ""Cars 3"". ""Cars 3"" looks great. However, I also wanted to be moved and touched."
168,Cars 3,7,17 June 2017,Old Vs New/Girl Power,"I saw ""Cars 3"", starring the voices of Owen Wilson-The Zoolander movies, The Cable Guy; Cristela Alonzo-Cristela_tv, Hey It's Fluffy!_tv; Nathan Fillion-Castle_tv, One Life to Live_tv; Larry the Cable Guy-A Madea Christmas, Delta Farce and Armie Hammer-The Birth of a Nation, The Lone Ranger_2013.This is the third-in case you missed the number in the title-in the animated series about the adventures of race car Lightning McQueen/Owen. There are 2 main themes in the film; Old vs New and Woman Empowerment. In the first theme, Owen faces being put out to pasture because of his age-he looses a race to the new rookie, Armie. Nathan plays a sponsor that wants to put Owen's name on everything to make a buck, since Owen can't race anymore and that's what most athletes do when they retire. Owen doesn't want to give up on his racing career just yet so he decides to get some intensive training by Cristela, a racing coach, who really wants to be a race car herself, but was never given the chance by her male peers, which covers the second theme. A female can do whatever a male can, as long as they put their mind to it. Larry/Mater returns as the tow truck friend of Owen. It was a good movie that the kids that we had with us seemed to enjoy. There is a scene after the end credits so if you are a fan of Larry/Mater, you might want to stick around. It's rated ""G"" for car crashes, including a demolition derby and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. I'm not the target audience, but I might buy it on DVD for the grandkids to enjoy."
169,Cars 3,7,17 June 2017,Cars 3 saves the franchise(This may contain spoilers),"Cars 3 poses as a savior for the franchise. The director offers a decent emotional story line with a little pinch of humor.It had a deeper meaning than its predecessors and is a fine movie made by Brian Fee. Mcqueen uses doc as an inspiration and sees something unique in Cruz just like what doc had seen in him. Instead of the usual hero McQueen becomes by winning the race at the end, he does accept his days were gone and puts his life on Cruz. This may give more possibilities for a new part and i hope this is not the last one.At some instances it also promotes feminism and reaches to the youth of today.Still, pixar failed to give that emotional punch that McQueen's career end.It is a good film with a good concept but could have been built better with the given deep message. The film is quite good."
170,Cars 3,7,17 June 2017,Cars 3 is the best one in the series yet,"Cars 3 may not reach the heights of Pixar's finest achievements, it certainly stands as not only the best Cars, but the most mature one as well. Cars 3 is a lovely, clever and entertaining generational tale with tons of heart, a simple and effective storyline, wonderful candy-colored visuals and winning voice work from the talented cast of returning regulars and welcome newcomers. The best part is where Mcqueen decides to give Cruiz a chance of her career, this is where Pixar is best at creating emotional and joyous environment. A good improvement on its predecessor 'Cars 2', had its own laughs and emotions. Would love to see If Cars 4 is made on future.My Rating : 7/10"
171,Cars 3,7,13 January 2018,"Before the ""storm""","Great animation, great action, great story! Great, great, great! I love it. It's so family-friendly and enjoyable. I guess there's hardly anyone that can't like it. It got my attention since the beginning and there's probably the reason I watched it until the end. It's adorable, a dream come true for kids, and for adults, who didn't lose their teenage spirit. Another Pixar movie, another success! Well done, guys!"
172,Cars 3,8,1 January 2018,Very enjoyable,"This was just what I wanted, a nice story with lots of heart. Many parts resembled those from the Rocky-franchise, which I love. If I have any complaints it's that the story, though pleasant as it was, it was very paint-by-numbers. I knew from the second Cruz revealed her ""secret"" what was going to happen. The story was simple and predictable but I still found myself enjoying it. The slow pacing allowed me to feel emotions. You get too tired from all the explosions and aliens in most other movies that it was nice to have just a story. It felt very grounded and soothing."
173,Cars 3,10,1 January 2018,I loved the movie,"Never seen negative review so foolish, the third installment came with such a fresh idea. Its not about Lighting McQueen race and winning but to progress an idea that the new deserving generation should get a chance and be mentored by the old.I knew that movie has did this so brilliantly.I am an Indian and loved this movie from the beginning to the end. I gave it 10 rating on Imdb for that."
174,Cars 3,7,14 December 2017,The new age begins!,"Having seen enough animated feature that possible eligible for the 2018 Oscars, I'm really disappointed with the result of some of the big titles. Yes, including this one, not big films, except 'Coco' are up to any impressive. The bright side is, after a long time, 2D animation might win. This was an okay film. Though I liked the story outline, but did not like how it all was narrated.I have seen the evolution of 'Harry Potter'. I meant the cast, particularly the main three. For a decade, the little kids grew into older teenagers. But for an animation character, there's no concept of ageing. They always remain same. This film just gave a new perspective. I mean it talked about being or growing old and how it impacts our lives. That we can't hold forever our safe position. Sooner or later, the youngsters will take over it.McQueen is enjoying his racing, competing with his friendly opponents. But it all changes when a young rookie rewrites the history. Without able to cope with the new generation and their aggression, how McQueen and Co like to counter the latest threat is the film's story. Liked such inspiring storyline. I mean it would inspire more the middle aged people than anybody else. But it is a fun film for all ages, particularly the kids. It is just like turning 'Rambo' into 'Creed', I just want a new beginning in the next sequel.7/10"
175,Cars 3,7,2 December 2017,Deconstruction of the character Lightning McQueen,"Pixar did a good job on the look of this movie, the graphic quality increased, making the scenery more beautiful. For me, the first movie is the best of the trilogy, but ""Cars 3"" is much better than Cars 2. The story begins with Lightning at the height of his career, world famous and winner of several championships, but faster and modern cars appear. Mcqueen suffers an accident and everyone questions his stay in races, but he doesn't wanna give up and wants to defeat his new rival at all costs. McQueen gets a female trainer (Cruz) but finds out she's incompetent, so he will teach her to run for real. Then Mcqueen decides to look for the former trainer of Doc Hudson (Doc is mysteriously dead but his instructor is alive and well). Lightning did not accept that he would have no chance against Storm, to make matters worse, Cruz overcame him in all races. So he was completely unmotivated for the championship and in the middle of the race he gives up and asks to be replaced by Cruz.Incredibly Cruz surpasses all the cars (much more experienced than her) and win. McQueen becomes the ""new Doc Hudson"" getting the colors of Doc and Cruz is hired by Dinoco. Concluding: McQueen came to be seen as an incapable old man, leaving his legacy to Cruz, but remains world famous and loved by all.Lightning just had to accept that he is not the best in the world anymore. This was very sad and disappointing for me and for anyone who loved the first movie, but even so Pixar managed to make a acceptable end to the trilogy."
176,Cars 3,8,1 December 2017,Settle Down Negative Nobodys!,"Listen, this is my first review for any movie on IMDb or anywhere else, but I felt obligated after reading so many negative reviews. This is such a feel good movie for people of all ages. It does have to do with passing the torch, but also the emotions that comes along with busting your butt and coming up a bit short. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, sit back, and just enjoy the ride. It's the same Cars universe that everyone has come to love and this one is pretty high on my list of recent Disney greats. Too many people are whining about the decisions Lightening makes in the movie, but at least we have lots of McQueen in his one! We missed him in the second, but of course Mater was fun to have, but this one was a refreshing return to form with much more racing involved in the story. Give it a chance and enjoy the fun bonding between all the characters and the feel good end to a new generation of racing and racers. ✌🏻"
177,Cars 3,,25 November 2017,"In My Opinion, Pixar's Greatest Work","I've been reading and watching other reviews for this movie. Most of the reviews are people saying ""Eh, it's okay, certainly not the best and not the worst, but at least it's better than Cars 2"". While I do agree that this film is light years better than the mediocre and lackluster Cars 2, I disagree with them saying it's only OK, because I think this movie is the best thing Pixar has ever made.I know it's a very unpopular opinion, but I loved this movie to death. I thought it had a great story with a thought provoking and wonderful moral, that being that we all grow out of our job some day, and that we shouldn't push ourselves to continue being the best, but instead embrace retirement and inspire others to become what they want to become, by presenting them with guidance and hope.Another thing I loved about this movie was the characters. Lightning McQueen was awesome as always, even though he was a jerk in the middle of the film, but eventually he learned his lesson in a surprisingly hilarious and lovable scene that couldn't help but make me chuckleMy favourite character in the movie was without a shadow of a doubt, my favourite animated movie character and my favourite character of all time (alongside Rintarou Okabe from Steins;Gate and Starlight Glimmer from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic) was Cruz Ramirez. Cruz has got to be one of the most lovable characters in all of media, she's determined, she's passionate, she's inspiring, and most definitely a lovable character. Cruz is just awesome and lovable in every way imaginable.Also, no surprise, the animation in this film is stunning, but it's from Pixar; and their animation never fails at being great.Overall, I give Cars 3 a fantastic 10/10, for being a wonderfully enjoyable movie with lovable characters, a thought provoking and inspiring message, and a great story. In my opinion, definitely Pixar's best."
178,Cars 3,7,22 November 2017,The final lap.,"The cars series has been a regular fixture in our house for years. Both of our boys love the films and despite them not being highly thought of critically, I have no problem with them and admire their heart, humour and amazing production design.It's important, at this point, to remind everyone that Cars has always been about the racers, not the race itself. Cars was bookended by the races and Cars 2 used them as tentpoles to build the rest of the story on. Cars 3 again uses the races as bookends and chronicles the hero's journey, not the race (which is pretty much where the first Planes movie went wrong).Years have passed since the first movie and McQueen continues to be a dominant name in racing, alongside a pair of friends/rivals. The camaraderie of the race circuit is painted positively but into this status quo comes the shark-like form of next-generation racer, Jackson Storm. Storm's success opens the floodgates and established veterans are replaced one-by-one by more next-generation racers.It's an obvious mirror of events in the first movie, where McQueen stepped up to challenge the established leadership rivals, but here Storm is completely dominant and rather than having a single racer upset the apple cart, we get a whole generation coming into the mix. In the end, McQueen isn't the isolated agent of change, he's one of the last of the old-guard.Pushing himself to the limit, McQueen comes a cropper and has to be snapped out of his off-season funk by his friends, before finding himself at the advanced training centre of Rusteze's new owner, with access to the same state-of-the-art facilities that the competition has access to.What follows shows conflicts between the 'old way' of training and the modern techniques, with his younger trainer, Cruz Ramirez, as often as not falling foul of the conflict. Their travels will take them down the roads well-trodden by McQueen's departed mentor, Doc Hudson (who we learned had died in Cars 2) as McQueen tries to find his Mojo, whilst introducing Ramirez (who once was frustrated in her own attempts to become a racer) to what makes a 'real' racer.With the help of Doc's former trainer, Smokey, Cruz and McQueen work side by side to help Lightning raise his game, with Ramariez learning as much, if not more, than the car she's supposed to be training.In the end, Lightning has to hit the track one more time, having to prove to his new boss that he can win, or face retirement.The film feels much closer to Cars 1, but here the threats feel much realer. Time is catching up with our hero in a sport where technology changes so fast and what was once cutting edge can quickly become an antique. Both Storm and Ramirez reference growing up watching McQueen's races and learning much from watching him, yet both are advocates of the new technology and training approaches that are forcing him to reconsider his role in the sport.The weakest spot is Jackson Storm, who comes across as bland and characterless (other than being genially snide). We want to see him beaten almost more as an audience obligation, than actually having enough to dislike (having Chick Hicks lurking around shows him off as being a particularly bland antagonist).Visually, the film is gorgeous, but perhaps lacking some of the design flair of the first Cars movie and the soundtrack is solid, although lacks the punch of Cars 2's excellent spy theme. The vocal talent is, as expected, completely on point. Owen Wilson handles McQueen's emotional roller-coaster well and the supporting cast know exactly what they're doing and do it to a tee.Importantly, this movie feels like it brings an arc to a logical close. Kudos to Pixar for trying to round this out in a sensible way letting their characters grow old gracefully."
179,Cars 3,10,20 November 2017,Give this film a chance to grow on you,"I don't normally get motivated to do many reviews unless I either see a major injustice in representation or I am just blown away by a film. In the case of Cars 3, it is the former, don't take the one star reviews word for it, do give this movie a go. There are a few things to get clear here with the polarity between negative and positive reviews.** I do raise spoilers in this review sorry, so turn away if you don't want them **1) Cars 3 has had quite a gap between the disaster that was Cars 2 and the debut film, so fans understandably have incredibly high expectations for Lightning's character and his general development. It is also clear to me people feel that Pixar did not deliver what was assumed by some to be the obvious resolution to the trailer of Cars 3. I do agree with that sentiment, but why is that actually a bad thing? Films are meant to challenge peoples assumptions, and take them on a journey they didn't necessarily anticipate. 2) Cars 3 - and Disney in general - appears to have a new direction in recent movies with regard to triggering new story lines and extending the life span of the trilogy. I personally think some of the negative feedback here stems a bit from the older formula thinking that the third act of a trilogy is to an extent a finality. In that context, it is indeed *SPOILER* a massive shock to think that the final act for Lightning is conceding defeat to a new stock of racers and letting his younger protégé take over. But there are so many hints in this film that indicate this not actually a final act at all, the exact same formula Disney has embedded in other film franchises lately. If you consider that this is actually more of a Cars reboot of the universe (masking the mistakes of Cars 2) there is an exciting prospect that there is a lot more in stock for Lightning - and of course Cruz. 3) Cars 3 is seen as a big poke at age, with much humour focusing on how old an decrepit Lightning not to mention the ""Millennial"" commentary I have seen with the next gen racers. Yes, on the surface I think this is pretty prominent, and can be quite insulting to the intelligence of the original fan base. But hang on, much of the humour coming from Lightning in Cars 1 is very much the same focus. Lightning's condescending remarks of Doc early on, his ego and self importance as the hot new rookie racer. His colleagues - except for maybe Strip Weathers - were equally shallow and greedy competitors. The power behind Cars was Lightnings maturity from this ego and the development of his respect for age and wisdom - in a racing world full of sponsors looking for the next big racer. Cars 3 develops in equally powerful ways, Cruz (who at the beginning teases Lightning incessantly and prejudges non-technological methods) soon embodies the lesson that Lightning was in the first film. Couple this with the idea in the film that it is actually Lightnings pride that is allowing him to be beaten and failing to see the qualities in older ways and I think you see a lovely integration and flow on from Cars one with this film. 4) A lot of negative reviews about this film seem to struggle a lot with the transition from Lightning as the only top dog competitor and Cruz as an emerging and victorious competitor. I'll be honest, I always will love Lightning's character more than Cruz, I identify more with him than I do Cruz. However, it would have been quite a boring film if all you saw was the same old Lightning come back dialogue. I suspect a lot of the ""flatness"" that people see in Cruz is primarily the result of directly comparing her to Lightning as the 'hero'! But I spoke with many other friends of mine who relate as much to Cruz as I do to Lightning - for identical reasons. I soon came to understand and appreciate that viewers needed to pull the rose tinted glasses away from Lightning's gaze and enjoy the journey between he and Cruz. When I saw this film a second and third time, Cruz started to become a much more dimensional character. Her presentation, target demographic and expression are just different to Lightning's, and that's a GOOD THING!I could keep going, there are quite a lot of things I could say but to be completely honest, all I can say is don't be persuaded by some of the 1/10 reviews here. Give the film a chance, rent it out, buy it whatever you want and but go into the film knowing its not 2006 anymore :)Peace out"
180,Cars 3,10,19 November 2017,Great!,"I absolutely loved this movie. I give it a 10/10 because I could relate to it and I thought it was inspiring. I actually was able to foreshadow what was going to happen next. I could really relate to Cruz R. She had a similar story to mine except she wasn't a failure. I recommend this movie, it's great."
181,Cars 3,9,17 November 2017,Not how I would have ended it but not as bad as people make out,"I think a lot of people have been criticising Disney too harshly for the twist in this movie. While I agree that at first glance it sends a mixed message to viewers especially with regard to ***SPOILER*** lightning giving up on the premise of the trailer. at a deeper viewing this film is in fact a brilliant morale lesson for all ages. Now most reviewers here who have given such bad scores expected a formula that lightning would just overcome the inevitable. But really, this is actually a shallow plot device. Age is a fact of life, you cannot keep winning forever, and you are a fool if you think otherwise. That is the lesson, lightning did beat storm, by doing what most racers could not, giving an opportunity to a bright racer who never gave themselves a chance. Accepting age and channeling all your victories, all your life's lessons, all the skills and experiences into another through teaching is the most unbeatable things anyone can do. Doc realised it and so finally did Lightning. If you, the viewer can accept that humbling truth yourself you will not be disappointed by Cars 3. There's a whole lot more to racing than just winning after all. Pixar have done a wonderful job, my only criticism is that they didn't find some way to bring Doc back. By the way, my son loved this film, just as much as the first."
182,Cars 3,8,14 November 2017,"Not as good as the first one, not as bad as the second one","Cars 3 is a third movie in Pixar's Cars franchise. We don't know if it's the final one, but it just might be. It does give off that kind of feel though since in this one our lead is facing aging and being replaced by the rookies (exactly what he was in the first one).I thought this closed the trilogy rather well. If not a trilogy, then certainly an end of an era for a franchise. The first one had every reason to be bad because the premise was an obvious excuse to cash in on toys. But it was surprisingly heartfelt and investing. Even though it's world didn't always make sense. I still remember absolutely adoring it as a kid. The second one, however, is a bit of a bad joke. It wasn't completely awful, but it was most certainly a disappointment. Now that one felt like a cash-grab. And forcing Mater down our throats (also forcing his apparent best friend relationship with Lightning McQueen) just didn't work. Thankfully, everything the 2nd one did wrong, was done right here. We have another emotional story.It introduces us to some new characters, it gave us some nice themes and messages and it paralleled certain parts of the first one in an exciting way that I didn't see coming. I mean, you can sort of expect it happen because the entire second half builds up to it, but still when a certain twist actually happens, I was surprised. They actually did that. And for me, it worked. It's divisive, but I thought it was the most brilliant way to put an end to this. Especially if you were still a kid when the first one came out, this will make you EXTREMELY emotional. But in a good way. It's like Rocky Balboa in the first half and Creed in the second half. Still, I felt the plot kinda dragged in the second act and didn't really go anywhere. That's one flaw I had with this and it's a major one, but everything else worked well for me.I guess I can understand why it's divisive, but I thought the ending was the most perfect we could get. The first one is still the best, but this is a major improvement over the 2nd one."
183,Cars 3,,14 November 2017,"Almost As Good As The First One, If Not Better","Of all the films that Pixar Animation Studios has given us over the years, their Cars series is one that remains the least impressive of all. The first one barely managed to keep their winning streak alive. Cars 2 turned out to be Pixar's first real disappointment & remains their only critical failure to date. Cars 3, however, does correct a few mistakes and redeems the franchise to an extent.Although unnecessary just like the previous instalment, Cars 3 tries to add an emotional depth & resonance that its universe so far lacked. It may still not rank amongst Pixar's finest works but it is a much more focused effort and is a poignant, nostalgic & fitting finale that brims with heartfelt warmth, and concludes its leading character's arc on a satisfying if not memorable note.The story concerns Lightning McQueen who finds himself being overshadowed by a new breed of racers that use cutting-edge tech to improve their performance. Fearing that he too will be forced to retire just like his fellow veterans, he sets out to prove to the world that he is still the best racer out there. But to get back into the game, he must make several adjustments in his methods if he's to defeat his far advanced competitors.Directed by Brian Fee, Cars 3 ignores the events that transpired in the second chapter (for a good reason) and features a much more grounded, uplifting & emotional story that finds our well-past- his-prime character yearning for the glory days of the past, and also covers themes like accepting when it's time to step aside, passing the baton & embracing the next phase of life, thus offering a journey that not only appeals to children but grown ups as well.As always, the computer animation from Pixar is flawless. The photorealistic rendering of the race tracks and other locations carry a live-action feel. The set pieces are meticulously detailed and the new automobiles are fabulously designed. Camera-work is slick, sharp & sophisticated. Editing is an improvement compared to last film. And last but not the least, Randy Newman's background score has a sentimental quality that is in tune with the film's emotional tone.On an overall scale, Cars 3 scores better than anticipated and leaves the bitter aftertaste of its forgettable predecessor in the dust. It is almost as good as the first one, which isn't saying much, but it shows that Pixar isn't afraid to step into the universe that dented its winning streak to rectify the errors and leave behind something better. An apt conclusion to Pixar's most middle-of-the- road franchise, Cars 3 is no gem but it is an emotionally involving ride that steers the series into the horizon with its headlights in tact."
184,Cars 3,10,11 November 2017,Like Cars 1 then you might like Cars 3,"Inspiring, exhilarating, exciting, humorous, and more, all that was Cars 1 you will find in Cars 3. The classic is back. Love the sounds, exhaust, the reflections, shadows, smoke from the tires, the feel of the race track, down to the debris found on a hard run road, it's all there. Back to the country, the roots, receiving life lessons from the Old Pros. Finding what's important in life, the good in people, inspiring others. No political agenda like that in Cars 2, which was a flop. Simply put, if you loved Cars 1 you're going to love cars 3.After reading so many bad reviews, much of which comes down to the ending of the movie. People expect a classic come back, a Rocky Balboa moment and didn't get it, there has been much disappointment, broke my heart too. I would have liked to have seen that come back, then let McQueen move on to inspiring others like Doc Hudson, in the next move, example Cars 4. If you payed attention to Doc Hudson, ""you got a lot of stuff kid"", ""all I see is a bunch of empty cups"", ""When was the last time you cared about something except yourself, hot rod?"", etc. Doc taught life lessons, one of which it's not all about YOU! Cars 3 instills that teaching. Doc Hudson would have been proud of McQueen for inspiring others."
185,Cars 3,9,10 November 2017,A Fantastic Way to End It,"When I was a bit younger all I could think about was how cool Lightning McQueen was and how great the first Cars movie was. Being a little bit older now, Disney tried to keep up with the kids who saw it when they were younger. They did a great job of that.I don't get the bad reviews. The visuals were stunning. The characters felt real. (The nods back to Doc Hudson got me a little emotional and it's hard for movies to get to me!) The humor was more than I expected out of a Disney movie for kids. It put a huge grin on my face.I haven't really been too very impressed with Pixar's latest films but this one is a true winner. It isn't pretentious and it makes you feel good. People were saying this feeds into the PC demographic. (McQueen letting the female character come and win the race for him.) Now when those sorts of things happen in movies I am the first one to call it out. It's always silly and forced and never done well but this wasn't that. They weren't just being PC. Lightning grows up. He passes the baton and gets to be Doc Hudson for the next kid in line and I loved that. It really just warms you up. And like I said, that's hard.Cars 3 brings in the stunning visuals that the first two didn't have and brings in the old backwoods feel we got in the first one. This is one good film to sit down and watch for a fun night. I give it a good ol' 9/10."
186,Cars 3,10,7 November 2017,Stop Giving Bad Reviews And Higher The Rating!,"Lightning McQueen, now a seven-time Piston Cup racing legend, finds himself overshadowed by Jackson Storm, an arrogant rookie who belongs to a new generation of racers that use the latest technology to improve their racing performance. This causes McQueen's fellow veterans to either be retired or fired by their sponsors to make way for the new rookies. In the final race of the season, as he tries to catch up to Storm and the other leaders, McQueen suffers a violent, nearly fatal rollover crash, leaving him badly injured.Four months later, while recovering in Radiator Springs, McQueen isolates himself from his friends, and spends his time watching footage of his late mentor, Doc Hudson. Confronted by his girlfriend, Sally Carrera, McQueen fears being forced into retirement as Doc was. Rusty and Dusty, the owners of McQueen's Rust-ESE racing team, send him to a new state-of-the-art racing center, much to his surprise. When he arrives, he learns that they have sold Rust-ESE to a new owner, Sterling, who assigns him to work with trainer Cruz Ramirez. McQueen eventually becomes impatient and annoyed with Cruz's methods, and attempts to use a high-tech racing simulator, only to cause severe damage to the equipment.Convinced that McQueen is no longer capable of winning, Sterling is ready to take him off the racing circuit, and use him for product endorsements. McQueen offers a deal instead  if McQueen wins the first race of the upcoming season in Florida, he can decide when he retires; otherwise, he will retire immediately. Sterling accepts the deal, but assigns Cruz to work with him one-on-one. Instead of improving his own top speed, McQueen spends most of the day helping Cruz get used to racing on the sandy coastline outside of the training center. For inspiration, they travel to a dirt track on which Doc raced, but inadvertently end up competing in a demolition derby, which Cruz ultimately wins. Distraught at the apparent waste of training time, McQueen rages at Cruz and, in the process, accidentally breaks her trophy. Upset, Cruz reveals that she had wanted to race professionally just like McQueen all her life, but never started a race, because she felt outclassed. She resigns as McQueen's trainer, and starts back to the training center.Learning that Storm has set a new lap record, McQueen calls his best friend, Mater, for advice. Mater suggests that he should track down Doc's mentor, Smokey. McQueen catches up to Cruz and convinces her to come along, and the two travel to Doc's hometown of Thomasville, Georgia, where they meet Smokey and several of Doc's old friends. Smokey reveals that even though Doc never raced again after his crash, he found a new happiness in training McQueen. After Lightning McQueen accepts that he will never be as fast as Storm, Smokey and his friends teach McQueen and Cruz how to drive smarter than Storm, with Cruz serving as a sparring partner for Lightning. However, during a final practice race, Cruz suddenly overtakes McQueen and he has a flashback to his crash, shaking his confidence.At the race in Florida, McQueen is encouraged by Smokey and his friends, and gradually pushes up through the ranks. Still convinced McQueen cannot win, Sterling spots Cruz in the pits, and orders her to return to the racing cent re to begin prepping another racer for the following week's event, despite her wanting to stay and watch the race. McQueen overhears the exchange and remembers that Cruz had wanted to race because of him. He decides that Cruz is the answer to beating Storm. Entering the pits, McQueen has his pit crew outfit Cruz for racing, complete with his racing number, giving her the chance to finally race. Cruz uses McQueen's coaching and Smokey's advice to catch the leaders. Feeling threatened, Storm tries to intimidate Cruz, even pinning her to the wall during the final lap of the race. Instead, Cruz uses the wall to vault over Storm and take first place. She and McQueen are both credited with the victory since they both raced with the winning number. Cruz quits her job with Sterling and accepts an offer from Tex Dinoco for his Dinoco racing team.Later, at an exhibition race in Radiator Springs, McQueen and Cruz reveal they have adopted Doc's old racing colors and number, respectively, to honor his memory. Tex Dinoco informs the group that he has bought Rust-ESE from Sterling, and McQueen decides to continue racing and train Cruz as well.In a post-credits scene, Mater, at his junkyard, tries to answer a call from his phone. But, he knocks his reception antenna and his phone goes dead, much to his dismay. Give The Bad Reviews To Big Hero 6!"
187,Cars 3,8,4 November 2017,Cars 3 - surprisingly not for kids,"This movie deals with heavy themes such as lost youth and mortality. There aren't many jokes, and the movie is more of a drama than any Pixar movie I remember watching. That being said, it is a fantastic film if you're in the mood for it, but I can imagine why kids would not enjoy it."

(Hopefully Not The End),This movie was absolutely amazing it showed that Lightning Mcqueen has gotten really old and is now in his later years and actually is showing how much of a lesser racer he is now to all the new competitors and especially the biggest one and the way they show Lighting Mcqueen coming through to train through his old age and to be a great racer again is amazing and also meeting his friend that is his trainer and becomes his friend and the way she comes out in this movie is amazing I love the way it showed her and his relationship its like a teacher to a student or a mentor for him its amazing and the ending wow I did not expect that at all I thought it would be like every other Cars movie but it wasn't it actually captured what happened with Lighting Mcqueens mentor except with a little difference but it is amazing what happens at the end and even after the ending it shows how you can have two things instead of one and that's amazing they just make this an amazing movie but I wouldn't say its the best cause it's not fully a Lighting Mcqueen movie if you see the ending then you know what I mean but this is definitely my second favorite out of the serious and Cars 1 is my #1 because mostly you can never beat the #1 but this movie was fantastic though and a great finish to the series hopefully not the end of it but it was a great movie for that if it was the finish. But that's how I felt about it worth every cent I paid.
189,Cars 3,10,26 October 2017,Awesome story - nice trilogy if it ends here,"If u were planning to see McQueen beat other pixel racers in 10 movies to come u will be disappointed, this one is so much more thoughI've always liked sequels even more than the first sometimes, its the third+ that usually go off the rail. Cars 3 for an Animation keeps it real while doing the jokes we come to know from the first ones, i was very surprised they went with him passing the torch but it unfolded so good."
190,Cars 3,9,25 October 2017,I like it,"Despite the negative reviews, I really like this movie. Great animation and story which, to be honest, can be a little better but is still good for me. To me it's far far better than the second movie, it really has the first movie's vibe. The main thing I like about this movie is the feeling. I don't know why but I just had the best feeling while watching it. I believe it's worth your money and time."
191,Cars 3,10,23 October 2017,Just read this awesome review from one guy,"I was planning to watch the movie and was searching for the review. All the reviews I read, something was missing out there and decided to go deeper and check more further. Later after few hours of searching just found a great review regarding the movie, guys check this out: https://damadhav.blogspot.com/2017/10/cars-3-review.html and warning: spoilers alert."
192,Cars 3,8,23 October 2017,Why so sad?,"There are so many reviews saying that movie sucked. I understand, it wasn't way you expected and but all in all the movie was good. It had heart and soul not like the Cars 2. I can feel how much heart and thought put into the movie. I loved it. Hope you do too. It's realistic. Funny thing to say to animated movie about cars. :D"
193,Cars 3,,22 October 2017,Nice and fun for children,"This animated film tells the story of a tracing legend, who is losing luster because youngsters are rising fast in the leagues.""Cars 3"" is still fun and lively, with a lot of races to deliver thrills of speed. I think it is entertaining for children, as the cars are happy and the motivational teacher is full of energy. The plot focuses on the new character, the motivational teacher who has an unresolved issue, and the plot sets out to resolve it. The story is nice and fun for children."
194,Cars 3,9,22 October 2017,Why all the poor reviews?,I have been a huge fan of the cars movie ever since cars 1 and i think all movies are great. McQueen is getting old so the concept of this movie makes since.I did have a few tears as a large amount of the movie seems to be a dedication for doc Hudson as he unfortunately doesn't passed away in the movie because the voice of doc (Paul Newman) sadly passed away and i think its beautiful to give him tribute to the movie. i would definitely recommend!
195,Cars 3,8,20 October 2017,Surprisingly good,"First of all, all those claiming it was predictable, are lying. The movie wanted you to think a certain way and cleverly hid any notion of turning out how it did.After an entertaining 1st movie, a boring and bland second, there is this third one that quickly reminded me of the Rocky movies.With Lightning being bested by younger racers he seeks to become even faster, later on he just tries becoming better. So far, so Cars 1 and basically every Rocky movie.But while they follow this formula pretty well, they do shake it up in the end. While I get it if some guessed how the end would be, calling it predictable is a stretch, as it really follows the old formula too tightly, which also brings it down for me as it makes the movie a bit dull.I personally consider this the actual sequel to Cars and will ignore the second."
196,Cars 3,9,19 October 2017,Cars 3 is a movie with heart and a message to boot,"There have been a deluge of animated movies in the last couple of years with tired jokes, flimsy premises no soul. Now cars 3 is not a funny movie, it has a couple of laughs here and there but nothing noteworthy. But it is a movie with a powerful message. That self- belief is important but it is even more important for somebody to believe in you. For somebody to help you understand that anything in the world is possible if you set your mind to it. It is, in the end, a movie about an underdog. Although I saw it coming at the beginning of the second half, the twist near the end was predictable but satisfying. If you are expecting a movie that kids will enjoy, then no, cars 3 would not be that. This is a movie for teenagers and adults who are stuck in a 9 to 5 job, people who had dreams and could have achieved greatness had it not been for people around them telling them that it is wrong to dream and not everybody can fly. If you can get the inherent message then cars 3 is the movie for you. ""Tell me your dream and I shall give you wings to fly, for the birds do not own the sky."" - Ritesh Shergill"
197,Cars 3,6,4 October 2017,Back on track,"Cars 3 is directed by Brian Fee and stars Owen Wilson once again as Lightning McQueen, we also see Armie Hammer join the cast along with Chris Cooper and Cristela Alonzo. The story takes place some years after Cars 2 and focuses on an aging Lightning McQueen fighting for his place in the modern racing sport, when a next generation of racing cars begins to emerge. I have quite nostalgic feelings about the original Cars film since I was a kid when I first saw it. Of course now I do see it's not one of the best Pixar movies but I still enjoy it. As for Cars 2 I don't really care for it. For me it's a very mediocre film that bring nothing new to the table. Is Cars 3 an improvement then? I think it is due to one very important thing, the racing! Racing is finally back along with McQueen as the focus of the film and for that reason alone it's better than Cars 2. Cars 3 also successfully introduce some new characters, Cruz Ramirez(Cristela Alonzo) is a welcome addition to the universe and Jackson Storm(Armie Hammer serves as a decent villain. Also the animation is, as expected from Pixar, really great especially in the second act. The few points i've mentioned are what in my opinion makes this film an improvement over Cars 2 but unfortunately it's a very mediocre film. Although the focus of the film is on Racing it's still unfocused and feel like 2-3 movies slammed into one. And due to this it's hard to grow emotionally attached to any of the characters. But up until the third act I was fine with the film and thought it was as good as the original, but when a specific choice is made in the third act the movie lost me. I could have been fine with the direction the film took if I had been invested in the characters but I wasn't. Cars 3 is a fine kids film that adults also can find entertaining, but doesn't hold up compared to the other Pixar films. Final rating: 6/10 ⭐️"
198,Cars 3,9,21 September 2017,So much fun!,"Read my full review here: www.havekidwillteardrop.com/2017/06/15/movie-review-disney-pixars- cars-3/We have been fans of the Cars series but were definitely less than impressed with Cars 2 for several reasons. They head to Europe which feels like such a huge departure and we really didn't see Lightening's friends that we all love. While the idea of turning him into an ""International Car of Mystery"" was a fun idea, it just didn't play for us. In Cars 3 they are back doing what we fell in love with  training and racing. We also get to see the old friends we love. Sally is back along with the whole gang and we get to meet some new friends as well.My whole family really loved the movie although I may have loved it even more than my guys did  there is a big dose of girl power injected into this high octane film. This one isn't just for the boys and I have a feeling the girls will be as (if not more so) excited than the boys. I felt like we were back to what the original started. It reflected on the first but was fresh and colorful and you had all of the voices you remember.We love this latest sequel to the Cars series and highly recommend it!"
199,Cars 3,6,11 September 2017,Back to the Basics,"""Cars 3"" returns to its roots, and expands on its world without jumping the shark. The story and its beats are predictable, but it's the character focused parts of the film that keep it interesting since most of the film spends too much time referencing the first, as well as flashing back to moments that happened minutes ago, and it gets repetitive. The first half was the roughest to get into since it rushes exposition in order to get to Lightning's crash scene, which ends up not being that big of a deal anyways so it just makes the film longer than it had to be. What saves the film though was the 2nd half, where we finally get to slow down, and take in the story. If you enjoyed the first film, you'll find some comfort here. It's still one of the weaker PIXAR films to date, but it's not bad either as it eventually provides some new ideas to make it worth your time, and I appreciated it for being practical."
200,Cars 3,8,10 September 2017,Emotional and great,"The reason that I don't give 10 stars out of ten is because that I want a Cars 4 to get it (if it will happen). Anyways *THIS REWIEV MAY CONTAIN SPOILER* *FOR YOUR OWN PLEASURE, STAY AWAY IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER THE MOVIE ON YOUR OWN*So, I (really x 100) love this movie. Okay? I mean, it's not that often you see talking cars crash into a training-stimulation-screen, right? The movie connects with Cars 1 and reveals more about Hudston Hornet and McQueen. We get to meet a trainer who actually is an amazing racing car. We get to see McQueen naked. The jokes are living up to its name and McQueen is an old car. And like any old person/car, he doesn't understands new technology. With that said, when you are sitting down and eating popcorn, you will feel a connection, no matter your age and everything that makes us different from each other."
201,Cars 3,7,8 September 2017,You will learn something different on your life !,"Actually i'm not the fan of Cars franchise on Disney movie, but i think this movie is quite nice. The story is simple, but have many good point on morale message. Some people may not realize it, but the morale message is connected from the Cars 1 & 2. And that is really similar with our life ! Cars 1 teach us to have big dreams even we are only ordinary people. Cars 2 teach us to not forget our family, friends when we already successful. Cars 3 teach us something different in life ! I don't want to spoiler it, just watch and you will learn something on your life. Some adults may be bored with this Cars franchise because its similar with the cars before and not much difference on the animation and story, but it worth to watch even you don't bring your children. Just watch it last time because i think it will be the last of Cars franchise. Cars 1,2, and 3 really give us something on our life."
202,Cars 3,,4 September 2017,"""Don't feel stupid if you don't like what everyone else pretends to love.""","Who said that? I didn't. Emma Watson (Yes, Belle of the Beast of 2017) did. Don't believe me? Check out her quotes section on this site. If you catch my drift, you will know. And no, I have not seen that film, and most of the Harry Potter films that she starred in. And no, I don't know a lot about what she does, only bits and pieces of good things I have heard of.Okay. Now that I have just done a quick read of the junior novelization of the film and finished it, I can safely write out my experiences about this film. But, as I say to TV, you start at the beginning or don't tell me at all because I am putting down money for this and my reserves are limited and I won't accept internet freebie watching. True to this, I do remember seeing EVERY Cars film on the big screen in a big room. Of course, this one included. I'd add, I was someone interested in automobiles and racing, IN THE PAST. So yeah, I have a little knowledge about race tech. Watched the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans (24 hrs non stop, go the distance race) once on the internet coverage, never again. So I went into Cars 3 with a little memory of this past. Did not see much of the tech displayed here, but what gives? This is a kid's picture.Also, I did remember wanting to see more of Cars 2 characters. Yeah, that wasn't there. Therefore for those looking for that, I'm sorry, it's not here. But what is here, is something more. So it doesn't matter. Even if there ain't, I wouldn't have complained. And I am not complaining now.""He is facing his biggest rival,"" that is how the film's tagline go. And my only companion of words before I walked in to the theater. Move along now, let's go! And then, suddenly, the plot takes a sudden turn with a screech of tires. That moves into something that captures the mentor and protégé bond very well. And that is, indeed, the biggest gift that the film have given me. Don't get me wrong, I'm a 19 year old TV and film student, also enthusiast, who is also a casual movie goer. Course, don't expect me to mention the names of the characters of the film, because if you have seen it (1,2 and 3), you would know. And if you have see this, you'd understand. But do you see something that the majority either turned a blind eye towards or refused to care? Because for some strange reason this film really got under my skin.And, yeah. Reading the text adapted from the film, as I mentioned above, I felt a surge of motivation I have felt from the film. Hell, I couldn't even find this feeling from almost all of the moments I spent in secondary school, or university where I am still in my first year's second semester. That mentor and student bond I saw in this film, was a electrifying jolt of inspiration and motivation to me. And I couldn't throw it away. I just couldn't, it's too ""rare"".Franchise (I noticed) or not, I don't care. In this era filled with consumerism (Don't tell me that, Fight Club. I know you fight in a club, I don't do that. Thanks anyway.), you will see me turn down many offers to buy stuff. But Cars 3. Oh, be ready. When you arrive on digital format, I'll see to it that you join my collection of all licensed DVDs. Thanks for your motivation, I'll remember to use that for as long as I can in this life.What? Don't believe me? If you have seen it, look closer (American Beauty). If you have not seen it, consider.Something there? You better believe it."
203,Cars 3,7,19 August 2017,"""Cars 3"" wasn't tuned enough to get out from the garage","The anthropomorphic Cars universe returns to the race after a criticized pit stop called ""Cars 2"". On this occasion, emblematic Lightning McQueen retakes the wheel to run into the crude law of reality: the retirement. His components don't evolve, his environment do, therefore, while the beloved car stands up against a new horde of technological newbies, must choose which direction he will take for his future: he decides when he's done.Although it's difficult and paradoxical to say, keeping in mind the elaboration dimensions of the near magnanimous Pixar, the ""Cars"" franchise, despite being one of the most profitable animated proposals for the company via films and merchandising, is the lightest and less prodigious in the history of the American computer animation film studio. Previous dignity has been fomented by a first film as uncomplicated as sentimental and a reviled sequel as outlandish as ineffectivedisregarding the low-ranking spin-off about airplanes: ""Planes""which found their breaking point in scripts lacking the energy that leave much to be desired, at least in depth. Have you ever wondered why Pixar releases one more installment on the family of automobiles, considering the results of its spoiled predecessor? Well, the answer is John Lasseter. With over 20 years as animator, director, producer and, in short, Pixar leader, this man is the main promoter of the saga, because, in addition to advising the different fields of making feature films, he has directed the two car films, provoking he keep a deep affection towards his universe, and who does not like it? It is such the faith in his speed world that has put his hands on fire by Brian Fee and Lightning McQueen, in the directorial debut of one and in the emotional ""retirement"" of the other.Fee, recognized for its work in the art departments of films as ""WALL-E"" or ""Ratatouille"", accepted the big vote of confidence of Pixar to appropriate the third entry into the motorized universe. The filmmaker increases the mileage of the saga, converting it into the best easygoing proposal among its predecessors, balancing doses of nostalgia with realistic and sensitive skids, basing on a mature message, which, although it does not make muddy dealing with questions of delicate importance, it inserts misogynist missives openly, of course, relegating the special emotional and comic impact placed on the characters and the story.Although it falters keeping a constant pace and proposing attractive novelties in any of the narrative points, Pixar is characterized by producing ecstatic wonders in technical and/or animation fields, and this is not the exception. They don't infest exotic settings with which to profit, otherwise, exhibit once again, they return to the roots one way or another, however, get stuck neither in plain beauty of the deserts adjacent to Radiator Springs despite the story takes place in that area for a certain period nor in the traditional race track; the feature film goes from a sumptuous training complex to a speedy journey with Mack, where landscapes are interspersed majestically. These images are so realistic as the achieved car crash of opening scene, however, the pictures are lower quality in comparison with another animations from the studio, it's clear that it isn't asserting that they are of dubious quality, no, they're adequate and beautiful in their simplicity and functionality.The script overtakes the flaws of the second one by far, in this movie is appealing to sentimentalism through a dramatic effect, which is led by inescapable acceptance of age, an irreparable beginning for novice new generations. It's pertinent, but the incorporation of technology feels like an excess, and although cinema is lately motivated by this, it's not a necessarily leading element. Precisely, the theme of legacy is the one that raises the final twist and the corresponding gestation from the second act, since the first half hour is decaffeinated, slow and tiring, a stretching of the daring opening monologue that emulates the portent of the first film: ""I'm faster than fast"", but in fact, there's a shortage of gasoline. In consideration of characters, it was thrilling to know what the screenwriters would do with the car #95 (the year ""Toy Story"" was released), in order to he resumes the leading role after, incomprehensibly, the main attention was concentrated in the comic relief of the saga: Mate, in the same way, inexplicably, they give him a tight participation with few effective jokes but a big futility, perhaps, so that the audience would not disperse their attention from the true star. McQueen and his new flock of characters, in which is Cruz Ramirez, a coach sport car with aborted dreams about being a pro driver, they possess charisma and spark required to raise the level towards the end of the footage, their motivations and actions are more prudent, revealing a pure and human story, without decorations or possibilities of questioning perception, an undeniable feature that makes Pixar, Pixar.""Cars 3"" by Brian Fee turns on the engines of a franchise that was already parked in the garage, generating real opportunities to roar the car, textually, in upcoming years with the help of newfixed ideas. With regard to the (hi)story of McQueen, he has an ending as nostalgic as uncomfortable, the trouble is that doesn't succeed it with the melancholy that ""Toy Story 3"" achieved, reducing everything to a childlike thing, a car journey lacking impact, and although, in small extent, it's thankful, on the other hand, placed it as one of the less interesting Pixar films, as this world-class company is not only characterized by its visuals, but also by heart of its stories."
204,Cars 3,9,11 August 2017,"Cars 3 is good, but not great","Cars 3 starts promising but then loses that promise about halfway through the movie. The first part was great. The montage of the races was entertaining and shows what Lightning has become. Then, everything changes with the crash, which was excellently pulled of. Lightning experiences a bit of a depression, but then decides to make a great comeback. It's at this point the movie lost my interest. The rest of the movie is almost entirely about training to be the best race car ever and this training went on for way too long. Sure, this part had some amusing scenes in it, like the demolition derby, and also some scenes dedicated to character development. Eventually Lightning and Cruz decide to go to Hudson's old trainer and from here on out, the movie was saved. The rest of the picture is great with some tear-jerking moments for the true cars fans. I think this movie saved the franchise after Cars 2 and is a great finale for the trilogy. It deserves love, but it is still one of the weakest Pixar films."
205,Cars 3,8,6 August 2017,"For those that remembers how Cars 1 ends, it's in the same theme","The movie is good. Both my kids loved it and wanted to see it again sometimes. Yes.. it is generally featured that McQueen gets old. But he does train, he is actually fit and ready to compete in the final race - and he actually enters the race with very good odds.Do you remember how Cars 1 ends? McQueen does NOT win the race! He actually decides to do a good deed and to help someone else. Cars 3 is exactly the same! Once again, he declines a chance at winning the race (as I said he does compete and it looks very good for him), in order to help someone else."
206,Cars 3,9,4 August 2017,Enjoyable movie,"I saw lot of negative feedback about this movie before I went to see it by myself. I was positively surprised because it was a good movie.Those little elements that this movie had problems with were so minor, yet they are very emphasized in all of those 1-star comments here. People keep forgetting that cartoons are mainly made for kids and kids in the cinema theater were enjoying it. So what s the prob?The story-line was IMO awesome. It is certain, people get bored of old things, things develop and will be replaced with new ones. It is a fact, doesn't matter how badly we want this not to be true. I loved how they brought up Doc Hudson, the fact that he felt the happiest when he was mentoring McQueen was actually so touching, they nailed this with different scenes. I loved the new character of Cruz Ramirez. She was happy to help others with their weaknesses yet she had bigger problem with her own mindset. The environment was great. Nature, road trips looked great, graphics were awesome and kinda nostalgic. Puns were not so try-hard and fit in this movie. I felt the flow.Loved this, thank you, Pixar!"
207,Cars 3,8,3 August 2017,Surprised by the bad comments,"I planned to go watch this movie with the family (wife, 11 yo, 8 yo), but I took time to read the user reviews on this movie. Then, I told my wife that this movie doesn't seem great. However, we voted and finally, of course we went to the cinema to watch it. The best of the 3 movie remains the first one, but the n°3 is much better than n°2! I liked the story, the fun moments and the message (trust yourself, let your place to others, fight to win, etc). The end is quite unusual and I guess that's why some reviews are negative. If you liked Cars, I would definitely recommend to watch it. All the family said it's a good movie."
208,Cars 3,8,1 August 2017,Great film!,"Wow what can i say! Cars 3 is actually a very good film. If you've seen the first Cars you should definitely see this one. It's way better than the second!.Spoilers! Maybe counted as. (Owen Wilson) as lightning McQueen is trying to get back into the sport he loves! But there's a new generation of racers what take over. He needs help to get back into the game! In some scenes is quite emotional like the first. The story is very good and there's a bunch of new fun characters like (Armie Hammer) as Jackson storm a cocky next gen racer, and (Cristela Alonzo) as Cruz Rameriez a motivated trainer!Also some older faces return in cars 3 from the first cars movie which is great! I'm 16 and obsessed with cars! Also I like the fact (Paul Newman) Doc Hudson returns and is in flashbacks and is talked about in the movie.Overall this movie is very good but it doesn't live up to the original. I give this a fair 8 out of 10! Watch it you will be in for a surprise."
209,Cars 3,7,30 July 2017,Nicely done! A return to form.,"LAST WARNING: THIS REVIEW HAS Spoilers. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.Summary: In Cars 3, we meet up again with Lightning McQueen, who is a veteran race car by this point. Lightning finds his generation quickly being shoved out by electric race cars. He himself loses several high-profile races to a new upstart known as Jackson Storm. Even worse, Rusty and Dusty sell Rust-Eze to a billionaire business car named Sterling, who believes Lightning can only succeed as a merchandise mover rather than a racer (ironic given the endless Lightning McQueen merchandise out there). Now that he's teamed up with his personal trainer Cruz Ramirez, the world will see if Lightning is truly obsolete.I was ready to hate this movie the day it was announced. I remember how bad Cars 2 was, how it had nothing to do with the first movie and felt more like a overlong Mater's Tall Tales episode than a proper sequel. The only reason I gave this movie a chance was just because of that infamous trailer of Lightning seemingly getting into a fatal crash (the movie's not that dark, though). Having seen it today, I can confidently say that Cars 3 is a return to form.To start with the good, Cars 3 feels like a Cars movie. One issue I had with 2 was that it didn't feel like a Cars movie. It felt like an espionage movie with Cars slapped on it. It was all about Mater, when Lightning is supposed to be the main character. Cars 3 gives more screen time to the other vehicles, like Lightning or Sally, for example. Pixar remembered that Cars is just a movie about talking cars and likable humor with some deeper messages woven in, not spy action stuff. Even better, you needn't suffer through Cars 2 to understand what's going on this film because there are no references to Cars 2 at all in this film. Nothing about Mater being knighted or anything. I guess Cars 2 was just a bad dream! Next, Pixar delivers yet again with the animation. When the vehicles speed over the track, you can see each individual piece of the track being peeled off the track. The cross-country driving scenes are a nostalgic reminder of the first movie. The destruction derby scene with Ms. Fritter the school bus is a perfect showcase of how far Pixar has come within the past 11 years, as are the scenes reminiscing about Doc Hudson's glory days and his resentment toward the racing scene after his accident.The third and most honorable mention is Cruz Ramirez. She's easily the best character in the movie. She's annoying, but in a way that she's endearing. Her naive enthusiasm is contagious, and she appears to be a joyous, excitable car, made even clearer by her bright yellow paint job. She has her heart in the right place, even if she can seem a bit too incompetent at times. But, she shows a deeper, more poignant side to her when she gets into an argument with Lightning in the middle of the movie. She reveals her decision to be a personal trainer instead of a race car because of her lack of self-confidence, brought on by everyone, including Lightning, telling her she isn't a ""race car material"". Instead of following her passion, she went for an easier job out of fear or self-perceived weakness, not seeing her inner strength. That's easy to relate to. Lightning's decision to pass the torch to her is the main reason I would no longer mind Pixar doing a Cars 4 or a TV series. If they do so, which they probably will given how well-established Cars is, they should definitely feature Cruz. Now for the negatives. Jackson Storm is shown to be the new upstart and the poster boy of electric race cars. So, why did he get into racing? Why is he so unfriendly? What's his motivation besides being Lightning's rival? Jackson could've used more character development. As he is, he's just a generic ""arrogant young rookie"" type of character. He's entertaining, but he would've been a more memorable character had Pixar added more to his personality.Another issue I had was with some of the jokes. Some of the jokes are really cheesy, like the scene with Lightning's training program. On the other hand, it's pretty hilarious to see a car doing an exercise routine. It's made funnier by Cruz trying to get him in on the routine. I think even the guys at Pixar see how ridiculous the ""world inhabited by talking cars"" concept is, so they don't take it seriously. It's a dumb scene, but I'll admit that it's amusing to watch.Besides that, Cars 3 is not exactly groundbreaking, outside of the animation. You'll definitely see a lot the Disney formula in this movie, such as a huge argument followed by making up, or achieving your dreams after believing you're nothing. I've seen it in Moana as well, although it's fine because that was an outstanding movie. Similarly, Cars 3's use of the Disney formula didn't bother me.Overall, Cars 3 is a proper sequel to Cars, and it relies a lot on what made Cars so popular. If the box office is any sign, it seems that, unfortunately, not many audiences are giving this movie a chance compared to the first movie. I blame Cars 2 for that since that movie destroyed a lot of the goodwill from part 1. Had Cars 3 been Cars 2, maybe this movie would've done better. We would've had to wait 11 years instead of just 5 to get a Cars sequel, but it would've been worth it, methinks. Anyway, when you guys at Pixar choose to do more Cars content, make sure to put Cruz front and center."
210,Cars 3,7,30 July 2017,Nice,"Cars 3A new generation of super modern cars are making sense in racing, as we know them, led by Jackson Storm. After Lightning McQueen had an accident, he decided to go ahead and beat Jackson Storm. But she needs the help of Cruz Ramirez, a coach who dreamed of being a little like McQueen. With the help of Cruz Ramirez will try to beat Storm.Let's start with the characters, because with the actors you can not because I went to see in Spanish and I would have to go to see her again in English ... let's begin. Ray Mcqueen has always been, and will be, an idol of my childhood. After what he did in the first movie I love this character. In the movie you see much of the ideals of McQueen, especially at the end of the movie. This film introduces us to Cruz Ramirez, as I said before, a fanatic since the small of Ray Mcqueen. She is now a coach, who trains ""rookies"" to reach the big leagues. You will now have the challenge of training Lightning McQueen. She's a strange character ... And Jackson Storm ... the typical idiot who likes to insult the protagonist and believes death. I believed in this character, as a fanatic of Ray Mcqueen, but he will have to beat him the same. It would have worked well. But it was not the typical villain MALO.The animation surprised me from the first trailer. Those little things flying in the air will transforming in something beautiful and darkness.Nice 8/10"
211,Cars 3,6,26 July 2017,"Lessons on Aging, Delivered by Antropomorphic Cars","Now on the home stretch of his career, the tables have turned on racing legend Lightning McQueen: suddenly out-muscled by a sleek, younger generation, he's struggling to keep pace as the wily veteran amid a fleet of impetuous rookies. Much more in-line with the original film, to the point that *nothing* is mentioned of the wacky sequel, this is a natural, role-reversing progression of the themes presented during the franchise's first lap. It can be blunt and obvious, but at heart this is a kid's movie and I appreciate the effort to mix a little extra meaning into the destruction derbies and Hot Wheel paint jobs. The whole package looks great, of course, as one might expect from a major Pixar effort. There's tons of variety in the scenery, which is just stunning (the cars themselves occasionally seem glaringly flat by contrast), and the race scenes (particularly McQueen's big crash at the end of the first act) are vivid enough that you'd be forgiven for overlooking the giant eyeballs behind each windscreen. I wouldn't place it in the pantheon of greats in the studio's past, but it's at least a deserving successor to Cars 1, if not an essential conclusion to that story. They could've just doubled down on Tow Mater and his international slapstick hijinx, raked in the bucks and called it a day, but instead we received something a little more contemplative and deserving of a feature-length. Kudos for that."
212,Cars 3,8,19 July 2017,"cars 3 is basically toys 3, let me explain","Now that the cars trilogy is over, its similarity to toys trilogy is more than obvious. Both the trilogies follow the same structure.the first part of the trilogy tells a protagonist that seems to be at the top of his game and got knocked off course and goes on a life changing journey, he return to his life to do the exactly the same thing but with a better mental status.the second part tells a side adventure about our protagonist fighting a villain who gradually reveals his identity, both the villains came from a previous generation and are not very popular.and this bring us to the third part of the story, the next steps in life begins to unfold, which put the protagonist in a very tough situation. In toys it's the next stage in andy's life, in cars it's the next generation of racer. the protagonist tries very hard to get his old life back, but end up doing something completely different yet somehow connects to his old self, thus he happily moves on with his life. This shows a very different ways to deals with crisis in life unlike the villain in the second part, which could be summaries as refusing to let go and trying anything to relive the glory days.So like I said the cars 3 is basically toys 3. But because the world setting is not so good in the first place, the whole story just falls short in the cars universe. But pixar still does a great job given the whole narrative. In fact I think they give the best result. To improve the story they have to change the whole trilogy.Our protagonist has gone through a life changing journey and has gone to a side adventure with the newly improved self. So what's next? another life changing journey or another side adventure? For other studio the answer is MAYBE. For pixar it's NO. So I'm very interesting about toys 4 which may give us clues about Pixar's way to dealing with seemly ended story, where should we go next?"
213,Cars 3,8,16 July 2017,Loved it,"I became well acquainted with Lightning McQueen back when the original movie was released, my son adored it and I'd say I've seen it at least 100 times since. His brothers also loved it, and they were really excited to see this new movie (We'll all just ignore Cars 2). The younger boys loved it, and myself and my older boy thought it was a nice tribute to our favourite old Crew Chief, and to McQueen's racing career. Some reviews seem to think that because there is a girl racecar in this one, that somehow ""ruins"" the film. Well guess what guys, girls can race too. Imagine that! I see another review that mentions ""boys like boy cars more than girl cars"" - my sons are at an age where they haven't quite discovered misogyny so they loved all the cars the same. We enjoyed it a lot, it's much better than Cars 2 (which wouldn't be too hard, in fairness), and we'll be adding a Cruz to our collection as soon as we can."
214,Cars 3,6,12 July 2017,Better than its prequel & better than I expected,"Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) returns in the third installment of Pixar's Cars franchise. Now a veteran of the racing game, McQueen's life in the fast lane is threatened by the emergence of hi-tech, rookie racer, Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer). So as not to get kicked out of the sport he loves, McQueen searches for new racing methods to outmatch Storm. Joining him is racing trainer, Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), who has her own dreams to race. The first thing to say is that this film is a massive improvement over its prequel, Cars 2. This film felt like it was more similar in spirit to the original and, also like the original, focuses on McQueen and what racing means to his character (Mater gratefully returns to a supporting role). The film also looks at the importance of racing to the new character, Cruz. Although she possesses a seemingly perky and upbeat personality, she has her insecurities that make it difficult for her to race. In a sense, the film is an underdog story with both McQueen and Cruz as the underdogs. Storm was a decent villain, however he hardly appears in the film, which is kind of a shame. They also bring back Chick Hicks, the antagonist from the first movie, who is an annoying twerp and should just get off the screen. Now the film does start out fairly slow, which might bore some viewers, but it picks up again in the second half. There's also a pretty heartwarming moment in the third act. Overall, as someone who wasn't looking forward to this movie, it was more enjoyable than I had expected. It is vastly better than Cars 2 and felt like there was some actual heart to it.

215,Cars 3,7,1 July 2017,"Everyone seems to be missing the point to this movie, they want it to be just another formulaic kids flick","I have really lost interest in Pixar over recent years. Since up, there hasn't really been a groundbreaking Pixar movie. Because of this, and especially after the mess that was Cars 2, I expected this to be extremely mediocre just like most modern Disney movies. But I'm so glad i was wrong.(only minor spoilers)I understand why many viewers and critics can hate on this movie. Cars 3 is a movie with themes that center around retirement and giving up after your time is over. I think the vibes these themes create in the movie will relate to adults much more than kids, which is why many may not claim it to be a particularly great kids movie.I love the feeling of Lightning McQueen grasping with his realization of his final racing days. It's very interesting seeing how everything plays through regarding his frustration and resistance of just simply moving on. I think the plot and its exposition are fairly well executed, and though some parts are fairly predictable, and some pretty cheesy, (mainly why I didn't give it an 8) I still think it's a great film and thoroughly enjoyable. As a fan of Cars since it was released, (when I was a young kid) it really worked well for me, and I think it will for other long time fans. What's important to realize is that I feel like viewers who are lovers of the first Cars movie, and haters of the second, will thoroughly enjoy this movie, probably more than the kids will. I assume this is why it is getting so many harsh reviews."
216,Cars 3,7,29 June 2017,"Better than 'CARS 2', but still nothing too spectacular.","'CARS 3': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The third installment in the popular Pixar computer-animated comedy series (and the 18th feature Pixar film overall). The story this time has champion racecar Lightning McQueen losing his title to a younger high tech racecar, and then (after a major crash) he begins training with a younger racecar technician. The movie was directed and co-written by first time feature filmmaker Brian Fee; who served as a storyboard artist on the first two 'CARS' films. It stars the voice talents of Owen Wilson (once again playing Lightning McQueen), Cristela Alonzo, Armie Hammer, Larry the Cable Guy, Nathan Fillon, Chris Cooper, Bonnie Hunt and Kerry Washington. It's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also been a modest hit at the Box Office so far (although it hasn't done as well as expected). I enjoyed it better than 'CARS 2', but not as much as the original.After several years as a champion racecar, Lightning McQueen (Wilson) loses his title to a much younger, and more high tech, racecar named Jackson Storm (Hammer). Then, after several other older racecars are forced to retire (in order to be replaced by younger cars), Lightning crashes while racing. Many question whether he'll ever be able to race again, but Lightning insists he's not ready to retire yet. He's bought by a rich business car named Sterling (Fillon), who gives him the chance to race again, while training with a younger female racecar technician named Cruz Ramirez (Alonzo). Cruz has dreams of racing of her own though.I remember really liking the original 'CARS' movie, and practically hating it's first sequel. I think this third installment falls somewhere in between the two in quality. It's definitely well made, visually impressive and somewhat dramatic. Although a lot of the drama does feel somewhat forced as well. At least it doesn't have a lot of the stupid kids' humor that I think the second film is full of. It also has a positive and inspiring female empowerment story element to it as well. Which is always admirable, especially for a kids' film. It's a decent Pixar sequel, but nothing too spectacular (that's for sure).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/K3Maw4akm_o"
217,Cars 3,7,28 June 2017,"Someone like it, while others don't","Nice story of a new friendship for McQueen and a good setup for him to take a new road in future Cars installments.In ""Cars 3,"" Lightning McQueen suddenly finds himself blindsided by a new generation of blazing fast racers. He's seeing himself and his fellow race mates forced to retirement. Refusing to be told when he should call it quit, McQueen is determined to get back in the game, acquiring the help of a new sponsor and a young trainer who's secretly wanting to be a racer. But all that only brings McQueen to the doorstep of his own inspiration, the late fabulous Hudson Hornet. This enlightenment will prove once again whether or not Lightning McQueen still has what it takes to be a champion.It's obvious from ""Cars 3"" that Pixar had learned the lessons of their mistake or blunder that was ""Cars 2."" The story in ""Cars 3"" is more coherent, clear and straightforward and it goes back to Pixar's strongest strategy which is to appeal to our deepest emotions. It doesn't necessarily rehash the first film, but more of presenting our hero deciding for himself to take on the next chapter of life that is just as fully rewarding as beating his opponents on the race track, which I think is a well put progression in McQueen's evolution as a character.I can just say, follow your heart if you want to watch Car3. ---Yidioo"
218,Cars 3,,25 June 2017,Professional car racing movie in cartoons,"Car racing is very hard and the racing culture for the racers and fans should start early on in their adolescents. Great movie that truly depicts the real struggles that exist when your mentor is gone. Very true especially for car racing.Unlike ball players who frequently change teams and settle in different parts of the world and yet be able to play well. Racing is one man and one mentor for life and when the continuity is gone then all is gone. This movie reflects that theme clearly in words, emotions, sentiments and all. The end of most races are dramatic for the winners as always and this movie brings forth that excitement completely. From the start to end the movie had no pause or slow time. I saw most audience glued to their seat but smaller kids seemed distracted. This movie is an example of an animation mostly for teenagers and adults and not smaller kids. I gave this movie 7.5"
219,Cars 3,6,23 June 2017,The Best of Pixar's Worst,"With Fate of the Furious, Pirates 5, Wonder Woman and Logan, 2017 may go down in cinematic history as ""the year of the franchise fix"", and Cars 3 would certainly fit in that group. In what is easily Pixar's worst franchise, they have finally turned the curved corner from the mediocre original and the downright unbearable second. A film of simple plotting, stunning animated visuals, and tons of big childish fun, Cars 3 works as distraction until Pixar's next true masterpiece comes along. In 3, Lightning McQueen is far from the cocky car we first met. No longer the freshest wheels on the track, he spends the film doing everything he can to keep up with the rookies, with their new technologies and upgraded engines. The predictability comes off as a little empty sometimes, but there are some interesting u-turns taken. The training montages are great, the voice acting is improved, there's way less Mater and the final race is easily the best of the series. Specifically, the thematic parallels to Pixar are unique; pioneers in the ubiquitous CG-animation field who refuse to give up their mantel at the top of the heap no matter how long-in-the-tooth they get. Unfortunately, when the movie slows down to (over-)explore these things, we start noticing how little we actually care about these decade-old characters. For every decent joke, there are three lame ones. The villain is a two-dimensional missed-opportunity. Logically, there is a lot to overlook in order to fully enjoy Cars 3 as a thinking adult. Luckily, I was able to do just that, with Pixar providing just enough style, fun and introspection to cross the finish line."
220,Cars 3,6,21 June 2017,"Fine, sub-par with other Pixar films","Having grown up with the original Cars (2006) and playing with all the Lightning McQueen merchandise, it would be lying if I said I wasn't a bit excited for Cars 3. And I was excited. Was ready to see Pixar redeem itself from the failure that was Cars 2 and hopefully get back to what they're best at: entertaining animations that emotionally grab audiences. Cars 3 does this in a way, but is not on par with the original in any way and comes off rather flat and average.We return with Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a racer who has seen better days and is now facing retirement as new, faster racers seem to always get the best of him. With the help of a new trainer, Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), Lightning looks to get faster and eventually beat his nemesis, Jackson Storm.The biggest problem for this movie is the first half. The pacing here was very bad, as scenes just go by without much weight to any of them, trying to progress the plot along with horrible attempts at humor that never hit. The second half picks up pretty well though, and the film got relatively touching towards the end (although very predictable).Of course, Pixar's animation is great in Cars 3, as well as the sound design. However, these are technical aspects that we should come to expect from the acclaimed animation studio. The script and pacing needed work, but otherwise Cars 3 is a perfectly fun summer film that kids and adults alike should go check out."
221,Cars 3,7,21 June 2017,Cars 3 was quite an enjoyable latest installment in the series even though I wasn't fully alert during some of it...,"Let me say right off the bat that this third installment in the Disney-Pixar Cars series didn't have many laughs, at least from my perspective. And it's a possible result of that that I felt myself fighting sleep during the middle part. But by the time of the ending climax, I was wide awake and was starting to really enjoy what was going on by that time. Oh, and what a nice surprise to find out Paul Newman's voice tracks that was unused in the first one was provided in this one since he's now been dead for 9 years! I may have to watch this again to really understand the whole thing but for the most part, I really liked Cars 3!"
222,Cars 3,7,21 June 2017,Children will love it...but I hope there will be a new animated trilogy,"This movie extracts the idea of TDKR/Logan where the McQueen is struggling with old age and tries to redeem himself. However, the script in Cars 3 is more coherent and clear and it goes back to Pixar's strongest strategy which is to appeal to our deepest emotions, whether to take the bold step of retirement or not.Never had the experience of watching the previous installments in a theatre, but this time I managed to watch it in 4D. The 4DX is the movie experience for those who want to live the movie and not just watch it. With smoke, wind, light and water effects, it is the absolute cinema experience. It will be maximum fun when you see cars practicing in mud!Overall, it's a good one-time watch. Not to the grand level of the original Cars or other Pixar masterpieces, but good enough for watching it in 4DX.My digital score: 6.8/10"
223,Cars 3,6,19 June 2017,"Good sequel, but still doesn't hold up as Pixar movie","Cars was the first Pixar movie that was... good. Not perfect and not very good, just good. And second movie was one of the biggest mess, maybe even it's the biggest. So it was kinda interesting, what will be Cars 3: good as Cars 1, bad as Cars 2 or great as many other Pixar movies.Weak aspects: Much like Cars 1, it's the story that you've heard a billion times before. And like first Cars, it doesn't add something new (except it's cars, not people). Now it looks more like sports drama and you'll see some predictable clichés and sometimes it reminds Rocky series. The humor becomes a way too childish and to be honest the antagonist was kind of typical and uninteresting at all. Good aspects: I like how they made facing the inevitable and how this ""inevitable"" works in the worlds of Cars, it has good heart (can't say more without spoilers), some clichés fit into movie, main theme of movie is different from first Cars.Verdict: Good sequel for a good movie. It's not like a Toy Story or Finding Nemo when the older you get - the more you like this movie. It focused more on children and some nostalgia from Cars 1."
224,Cars 3,7,20 June 2017,An unnecessary but still enjoyable sequel.,"For some reason, Pixar keeps making ""Cars"" sequels after they make a great sequel to their previous classics. For example, after ""Toy Story 3"" we get Cars 2. After ""Finding Dory"", we get ""Cars 3"". I honestly don't know why they keep making them though. They aren't great movies as I think the second film is an absolute train wreck and they don't even make as much money compared to the other movies Pixar has made; the second film once again didn't make as much money as ""Toy Story 3"" made a year earlier. However, the series makes money in the toy department, I know that for sure, but I'm a film critic, so I have to look at the movies. So now we have ""Cars 3"", a movie that no one wanted, but still got anyway. Is it as good as the first film? It it as bad as the second? I'll tell you.Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is losing steam. He's being overshadowed by a rookie racer named Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer), an arrogant racer part of a new generation of racers forcing old racers out of the game. Lightning tries to stay in the game, but during the Piston Cup final, a car crash suggests that his racing days are over. Not wanting to quit, he decides to go into heavy training to try to beat Storm. His trainer, Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo) is eager to start working with him and makes him do some ridiculous training, but Lightning feels that he's being taught wrong and tries to show Cruz the old methods that his mentor, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) taught him when he was alive. The rest of the film is Lightning training for his big race in Florida so he can beat Storm and stay in the game.I'll just get this out of the way. The film is miles better than the second movie, no pun intended. It's the ""Cars"" sequel that some have been waiting for. One reason is because it doesn't use a lot of Larry the Cable Guy's character Mater, as he was made the main character of the previous movie which was one of the major problem. This film, on the other hand, moved focus back to Lightning McQueen. The story was nice. I really enjoyed the story they did for this film because it mostly focuses on the legacy of Doc Hudson, who was the most interesting character in the first film. The writers of this movie clearly knew that the second film was a derailment (one writer acknowledged it as well) and made a nice apology card with this movie. The animation, once again, top notch. Every Pixar movie I have seen always has great animation and this film, particularly the backgrounds, are no exception.  The characters I'm pretty split about though. While I did like seeing faces you didn't see in the second movie and I also liked the return of old favorites. However, the new characters I wasn't fully impressed with. I thought Cruz was a little too nutty at times and Jackson Storm too egotistical, but some times I could over look it. And once again, like every Cars movie, it's no where near as good as Pixar's other follow ups. It has some of the eye rolling moments that you expect. One scene has the cars using virtual reality and bumping was a notable example. But, I think it has more good moments than bad.So, is ""Cars 3"" a great Pixar movie? Absolutely not. Though is it a good ""Cars"" sequel? I think so. It's a harmless waste of time just like the first movie, and was a massive improvement over its predecessor. However, I do think that Pixar clearly wanted to get this film out the door first though, because their next movie ""Coco"" looks amazing. I think they are saving their talent for that movie. As for ""Cars 3"", it's an enjoyably decent flick, but I have no intent on watching it again."
