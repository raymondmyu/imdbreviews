0,Son of Saul,10,5 October 2015,The Gifts of László Nemes and Géza Röhrig,"We simply don't deserve László Nemes, the first-time writer/director of Hungary's submission for the Oscar's Foreign Language category, ""Son of Saul."" Nemes vacuums everything we think we know about filmmaking and the Holocaust, and gives it a raw, intense, and fresh outlook that we haven't seen since Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist,"" perhaps even Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List."" Not to mention, he is thoroughly aided and indebted to the stunning and remarkable talent of Géza Röhrig, in his feature debut. The two simply dance circles around other films and performances seen in this year, with an authentic and genuine approach to art, that we just don't get to experience too often. I'm in awe.""Son of Saul"" tells the story of Saul Ausländer, a Hungarian member of the Sonderkommando, the group of Jewish prisoners isolated from the camp and forced to assist the Nazis in the machinery of large- scale extermination. In October 1944, Saul discovers the corpse of a boy he takes for his son. As the Sonderkomando plans a rebellion, Saul decides to carry out an impossible task.Its direction like Nemes that should make the world very optimistic about the future of cinema. If we have filmmakers like him, getting in the trenches of history and the human spirit, and beckoning its awakening into our souls, we should be so lucky to have him display the beauty and evil of the world in such a provocative and engaging manner. His choices in which to shoot the film, and portray one of the most heinous acts in the history of our existence is just downright scintillating. ""Son of Saul"" plays as if we're watching a disturbing, noxious, and depraved home movie about a time in which we never want to see. From a near first-person perspective, we enter the revolting world of Auschwitz-Birkenau. He uses out of focus camera work, to not bath in the bloodshed, but wallow in the psyche of a man, that is desperate for purpose. It's the single best direction of the year. I'd go so far to say this could be the single best direction seen this decade. His script, along with co- writer Clara Royer, is so painstakingly simple but echoes decades of oppression in its short, respectful run time.Don't call him a ""poet by profession"" because newcomer Géza Röhrig doesn't believe in the word profession. There's only artists. Géza Röhrig is an artist, of which I haven't seen in some time. With little words, he says countless and devastating things about what he's feeling and what we know about ourselves. He doesn't use cheap tricks to engage the audiences like ""really intense face"" or ""really scared moving."" Röhrig displays the numb, almost disengaged weight of the world in every physical and vocal movement he chooses to exhibit. It's a flawless, masterful performance that we need more of in this cinematic world.Cinematographer Mátyás Erdély is your next great craftsman to watch, even though making his mark on films like ""The Quiet Ones"" and ""Miss Bala."" He frames close-ups that Danny Cohen himself, would hope to achieve in his next collaboration with Tom Hooper. He stays with a person, a scene, a moment, so intelligently, and so vibrantly, he places each one of us in the rooms, full of fear, and full of hopelessness. The subtle yet effective music by László Melis is sonorous but the Sound team is what really needs their praise. Tamás Dévényi (Production Soundmixer), Tamás Székely (Sound Editor), and Tamás Zányi (Sound Designer) create monstrous and dynamic effects that essentially become its own focal point of the story. We are listening intently, desperately, and just fearful at every nick, boom, and cry we come in contact with. It's something everyone should and will notice and applaud.""Son of Saul"" sneaks up on you. It's too important and critical to our cinematic landscape to overlooked or forgotten. I can't imagine a more dour and sullen experience this year that fills my heart with this much adoration. It stands toe-to-toe with most Holocaust films created in and before my lifetime. It may be the definitive one this millennium."
1,Son of Saul,9,21 October 2015,László Nemes' modern masterwork dwarfs every other film on offer.,"You cannot take the Holocaust lightly in film. Some have tried, but it fails. László Nemes' Son of Saul takes the Holocaust very seriously. Instead of recounting it in a sombre documentary-esque way such as Schindler's List or even the gut-wrenching approach Alain Resnais takes to Night and Fog, we are utterly present in its unpredictable and relentless horror. While most Holocaust films struggle between their representation of order and chaos, often deciding to switch between the two when necessary, Son of Saul finds the ideal balance, showing these small shards of order within the chaos. The most fascinating idea of its premise is to show the prisoners appointed with the tasks of guiding victims into the gas chambers, organising their belongings and then cleaning up after them. It's a well oiled and melancholic cog, while we know every hard effort to scrub and pull is in vain as their eventual death is only postponed and not evaded. Saul, played by first-timer and established poet Géza Röhrig, is one of those Sonderkommando prisoners forced to work towards the Final Solution. Our narrative follows him for only two days, but that's all we need to know to get a gruelling snapshot of his minute-to-minute struggles. When a boy nearly survives the gas but is pronounced dead shortly after, Saul recognises him  at least on some level, as it's never clear if the boy is his kin or not, but it is apparent he never took care of his own when he had the chance  and takes him as his son. To himself, he insists on giving his son a clandestine burial which must be officiated by a rabbi. Salvaging the body, locating a rabbi and performing even a small burial is near impossible despite them being in essentially a mass graveyard. Meanwhile, his peers are plotting an escape along with destroying the crematorium and will require Saul's help. However, he cannot assist both futile missions simultaneously. The film has an incredibly unique approach to the concentration camps. Shot on a tightly framed 35mm hand-held camera, the photography is almost always focused on Saul, leaving the atrocities offscreen or out of focus, but often vividly audible. If there is any complaint, it's that the editing suffers from its long-take construction, but the sound design is an absolute masterclass. Saul's face remains stoic but Röhrig soaks it all in, leaving his mournful expression to interpretation. While he's apparently numb, he's always fully invested in the moment. No scene is quite as hard-hitting as when we watch Saul listen to the screams of people dying in the chambers while he waits outside their doors. It's his one break from being forced to work, and he'll immediately have to remove bodies when it's finished. The way the film builds these routines are very intimate and exhausting and despite being a fictionalised story, it feels very real. Those rituals of removals and cleaning are contrasted with the Jewish rituals that guide their faith, and especially Saul's burial plan. But beyond the intense yet ambiguous horrors that show the cruellest side of humanity there's ever been in the modern world  despite us never getting close to a Nazi beside brief encounters  the film finds its emotional core in small gestures of compassion. Nobody is required to help Saul, especially in knowing the dangers involved, but there's an unspoken bond between every prisoner to help one another regardless. When he finds the rabbi who agrees to perform the service, it's not powerful because they've been stripped down and Nazis are murdering new arrivals around them  nothing compares to the experience of this scene  it's powerful because the rabbi says yes in spite of that. If they can redeem one shred of morality, it is a small victory and triumph of faith. Saul never lets go of that idea, even when he risks sabotaging the escape mission inadvertently. His mission to bury his son becomes increasingly arbitrary, but never without redemptive merit on a grand scale. This is an astounding debut film for László Nemes on every level. Even a seasoned visionary director would struggle in such a precise execution. Having worked for the excellent Hungarian director Béla Tarr, his influence is clearly felt here. Tarr also uses long shots and utilises impassive protagonists but Nemes' work is much more dense, engaging, and arguably accessible in its own way but mostly for the immediate empathy the situation earns. While it matches Tarr's poetry, it's a lot more theatrically dramatic. Every one of the supporting cast is on a razor's edge though they never outshine the constantly pushed, pulled, and shoved Röhrig. He need not step in front of the camera again after this soon to be iconic accomplishment. The film's power is immobilising and thoroughly unforgiving, but with good reason. Son of Saul, with its immaculate production, attention to detail, and own noble mission, is not only one of the best of the year but one of the best of the decade. Despite its small scope, it dwarfs every other film on offer this year. 9/10Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)"
2,Son of Saul,7,25 November 2015,A poignant but debatable attempt to film Auschwitz,"Movies about the Shoah (or Holocaust) cannot be solely discussed on the same grounds as other movies e.g. plot, acting, direction, camera, settings, etc. They raise questions about history, remembrance and ethics. Some persons debate the fact that Shoah CAN be filmed and, if the answer is positive, HOW it should be filmed. A ""bad"" movie (in terms of plot, acting, etc.) about Shoah is not just tedious, it could be considered as a lack of respect to the victims and survivors of camps and ghettos, as well as to their families. Even a ""good"" movie that inaccurately depicts Shoah could be considered as a lack of respect. For instance, director Claude Lanzmann (documentaries ""Shoah"", ""Sobibor"", etc.) strongly rejected ""Schindler's List"" even though in pure cinematographic terms it is compelling. For information the same Lanzmann approved of ""Son of Saul"".However these two questions (can and how) mainly result from a more fundamental question: WHY film Shoah? The most obvious answer is history and remembrance. But then why not only film documentaries (above-mentioned Lanzmann, ""Night and Fog"" by Resnais, etc.) and write books (Primo Levi, Semprun, etc.)? Do we really need filmed fiction about Shoah?The strength about fiction is it can convey more emotion, but that is also its danger: can any emotion render the absolute horror? Are we not fooled by our empathy when maybe there is no possible empathy? Of course the distinction between documentary and fiction is not so clear-cut, since documentaries use artistic features (editing, commentary, sometimes music, etc.), while fictions can be filmed as documentaries. This is where ""Son of Saul"" comes in and I apologise for this long, but I think necessary, introduction.First, we cannot classify this movie as a mere ""Description of a day in Auschwitz"" or a ""Movie where Shoah is a secondary element"", but fundamentally as a movie about Shoah, by its ambition, its clear historical references and its intensity. I will not detail the plot, this is available elsewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, it is a very violent, disturbing movie (rated R in the US but I would not recommend it to anybody below 17 even accompanied by an adult).""Son of Saul"" avoids the pitfall of voyeurism by focusing on the main character, Saul, and mainly showing what he sees. The dead bodies are mostly blurred, the cries are mostly distant. However this radical precept which is carried throughout all the movie (except for the last few minutes) almost constitutes a second-degree voyeurism where the director constantly seems to affirm ""Look how I avoid showing you fully what is happening"".Hence this strength of subjective view almost becomes a weakness as we empathise with Saul, notably his desire to bury what he thinks is his son, but less with other characters, even when his quest jeopardises the rebellion project. We do see to some extent how prisoners survive and die in the camp, but as a background to Saul's obsessive idea. Is the dead boy really his son? Is the rabbi really a rabbi or does he just want Saul's protection? Where is the body? Will they manage to bury it? So in a way the fiction of Saul blurs the documentary dimension of Auschwitz. In most regards, ""Son of Saul"" is historically accurate: the inhumane conditions, the constant struggle, the fights between prisoners, the role of the Kapos, the barbaric SS, the bargains, etc. As a side note, it also convincingly reconstitutes the way one of the authentic and very rare pictures from Auschwitz could have been taken by insiders (the pile of bodies outside).However actual conditions were certainly even more dramatic than those depicted: in general prisoners were much thinner and weaker, their clothes were dirty rags, their morale was very low, every moment was a tragedy. Also some elements cannot be shown easily: how do you film hunger, cold, pain, illness, despair? Can we blame the movie for not showing the full extent of the horror? I am not sure, because it might actually not be possible and even if it were, it would barely be watchable.It is difficult to rate such a movie. Should we rate a movie about Shoah? Considering the artists take the responsibility of making and showing it and hence of being exposed to criticism, probably we may, if we are careful enough to distinguish between aesthetics and ethics.For its audacity and cinematographic qualities ""Son of Saul"" probably rates 8 or 9/10: direction and acting are outstanding. For what we could call the ""Shoah ethics"" that I tried to describe in the introduction, I think it rates 6/10: a poignant but debatable attempt. Again, I am not sure any fiction could do much better. This is a personal point of view and I fully understand some persons were compelled and would rate it 10/10, or that others reject the movie with a 1/10. It really depends how one's own feelings react to such extreme images and artistic vision."
3,Son of Saul,8,29 May 2015,Very well-researched movie,"I do not understand how the previous commentators were able to add their opinion, since I saw the very first screening of the movie outside Cannes in the Művész arts cinema of Budapest tonight, on May 29, 2015.The movie was followed by a discussion and Q&A session with the artists.Director Nemes aimed to create a movie that is deprived of the post-war artifacts present in most Holocaust movies.For this goal, he and his staff made substantial historical research to make the smallest details truthful. The shooting took place from less than $2 million, in a very short period (28 days). French, Israeli and German investors did not give money for the movie for fear of a loss.As the director mentioned, a movie of this length is spliced together form 300 to 700 cuts these days. Theirs required only 80. You are in the camp, you are Saul Auslander. There is utter confusion, you do not know what awaits you in the next second. This is a reality movie with no happy ending that shakes you."
4,Son of Saul,10,9 June 2015,This is not a Holocaust movie,"After the news about the movie's success in Cannes, there was a lot of conversation about whether we need ""yet another"" movie about the Holocaust. Still, as I watched the movie, I have realized that the main subject of it is not the Holocaust itself, but rather the human and his choices between morality and necessities, between family and strangers, between dead and alive. And, this is that makes this movie a perfect 10 for me: the painfully precise reconstruction of the mass murder and the almost PoV-esque, brutally relivable presentation of Auschwitz's everyday is just the beginning, just the setting. Still, I cannot overemphasize it that the reconstruction feels so realistic thanks to the filming style (the viewer remains so close to Saul, the protagonist, that almost smells him), the acting (that is, basically showing empty shells of seemingly living people in most of the movie) and the details (people using myriad of languages, mainly Yiddish to communicate, for example).So, if Holocaust is just the setting, what is it really about then? It reminded me of a Greek drama with a protagonist, who has big choices with tragic consequences, with very clear dilemmas. With a big difference that you cannot hope of a divine intervention at the end  although as a viewer, I can understand if somebody hopes that some kind of happy ending will close the movie, after all, some kind of (even unreal) hope makes the members of the Sonderkommando alive as well.If you see a ""Holocaust movie"", you end up wondering about how this could happen (and why is it happening again and again). In Saul's Son, you will be haunted by the pictures of the killings and by the partly banal practicalities related of it, but the main question will be: what would have YOU done, not as a Jew, but as someone who is on the blurry borderline between victims and collaborators, as a parent, as a comrade as a HUMAN?  and that makes it way more than ""just"" a (quite revolutionary) Holocaust movie for me. Recommended for anyone who feels like 110 minutes of pain (it is, really, painful to watch) is worth to have an experience of visiting some dark edges of our humanity."
5,Son of Saul,4,7 October 2015,"Strong direction, performances, technical skill, research, and yet, it is a ""ride"" movie","I am really torn by Son of Saul (Saul Fia). It's a technical and acting achievement, to be sure. It doesn't feel like a first film. So bravo to László Nemes for pulling it off. And the film achieves what it sets out to do. So using my own criteria of what makes a good film, I should be giving it a higher score. But I can't. In the end, what was it? It was a decent into madness. It was a ""ride"" film, that pulled its protagonist and us along for some dramatic moments in Auschwitz, 1944.Let's get the technical achievement kudos out there first. This movie was shot on 35mm in Academy Aperture. It is shot almost entirely in close-up, on the head of the protagonist, with most action occurring in his (and our) peripheral vision, out of focus. The effect is obvious. When he is pushed or pulled, so are we. We are right there, next to his head, seeing everything, and also sometimes looking away. Direction - outstanding. Nemes gets great performances out of his actors. He sets and maintains the tone. He did a fine job. Hollywood would destroy this movie. They would give us wide angle establishing shots and dramatic prisoner monologues. Not here. This is a corner of a huge prison, with just a few locations, and most dialogue is in whispers. A network of whispers. The research is apparent. I was reminded by several survivor accounts of Auschwitz watching this.Géza Röhrig has an amazing face. I imagine him getting the part simply by showing up to his audition and starting at the director. He is incredible. But so is the story, and that's where this film lost me.** Strong spoilers ahead **This movie is about a condemned man who has lost his humanity. Everyone has. However, in a most desperate attempt to do something humane, as a final mission, he commits himself to the insane task of burying a young boy who miraculously survived the gas chamber, but was fished off by a Nazi doctor. It might be his bastard son. But we will never know. The boy's death triggers his overwhelming motivation in this film. But, as one would suppose, his mission fails, step by tragic step. He is unable to bury the boy within 24 hours as directed by Jewish law. He believes he needs a rabbi to assist him in the burial, to say the kaddish as the boy is put into a hole. He risks getting shot multiple times in his quest for rabbi, and gets several of the his fellow prisoners killed in the process. He has a second mission given to him, but he fails it in pursuit of his personal mission. ""You have betrayed the living for the dead,"" his closest fellow Soderkommando tells him. While critics praise the film for it's humanity, I didn't see it. The story is about insanity. What a man will do when he goes insane. At that point, it becomes clear that he will reach a dead end and be shot trying to bury the boy somewhere on the prison grounds.But no. In the second half, the movie becomes a ""ride."" Think Gravity, but in a death camp. I was impressed by the second night sequence in this film. It's small, in terms of what went into the production, but it feels massive. It's one set piece after another. Our Sonderkommando is pushed and pulled into various locations; from speaking to a Nazi commander, to pushing coal for the crematorium, to obtaining inside information about his imminent execution, to being saved by one or more prisoners or prisoner-kappos (think wranglers of prisoners by prisoners). At this point, he and we are passengers, seeing events that really took place (not necessarily in the same month of 1944). The close calls are amazing, but also, somewhat unbelievable. He intercepts a line of new arrivals being shot and burned, and is nearly shot. He makes the cut of Sonderkommandos to be spared, but in thrust into a rebellion by the survivors. Then, he becomes one of the few prisoners to ever escape into the Polish woods outside the camp, and still manages to re- locate and carry the boy's body, now wrapped in a sack. At that point, I had to give-up on this movie. We all know how this ends. He wouldn't be able to dig a hole on the prison grounds. But now the film is going to give us that scene outside the prison. Incredible, and not in a good way.And so, in the end, I had to give this a thumbs down. We cannot allow ourselves to avoid criticizing films due to their subject matter. The Killing Fields sucked. And, the more I think about it, so did this. We need to preserve history. But we need to be able to question why a Hungarian director's decisions."
6,Son of Saul,5,28 January 2016,Out of focus,"I start by saying that I didn't read anything about ""Son of Saul"" before going to the theater, and that I didn't know whether it had received bad or good comments.""Son of Saul"" is not entirely bad and I think it's worth to see it, but it looks to me out of focus. I'm aware that the documentary - first person point of view is what the director wanted to give us, but I don't like it. Everything is so shaky, the hat of Saul is always cut and the background is blurred. I don't think that this setting adds up something to the movie.What is more important: I consider that the story is out of focus. There is realism - what the prisoners were told to be reassured in the undressing rooms (hot tea - hot coffee - hot soup waiting for them, disinfection, remember what's the number of your hook), the differences between people and their social background, with a lot of languages and a bad German used as a lingua franca, the dehumanization of the prisoners that obviously can't handle that kind of monstrosities, the word used for the corpses, that is ""stucke"", pieces, and the enormous rush required to the Nazi guards in order to be able to ""process"" (that's the term they used) all the people daily ""resettled"" to Auschwitz. I saw few days ago the monumental documentary of Claude Lanzmann called Shoah, and I think that the director of ""Son of Saul"" saw it too, because the ""quotes"" are a lot.But in all this background blurred realism, I can't get the purpose of the main character, that struggles to carry out a task that in my opinion doesn't make sense.It looks pretty clear to me that Saul has got no sons, since he had told so to his fellow coworkers, and he has no tears for the poor young kid, but still he feels compelled to give him a proper Jewish burial.I understand that in Auschwitz the action of risking one's own life has a completely different meaning than what it does in normal contests, and Saul states that too (""we are already dead""), anyway I still think that this movie is a good chance that has been missed."
7,Son of Saul,8,11 November 2015,Hard-hitting movie experience,"This movie starts completely out of focus - literally. The viewer sees only vague shapes moving around. Is this a technical error or an experiment gone wrong? Nothing of the kind. After a while, the face of lead character Saul Auslander moves close to the camera - and into focus.And it stays this way. In the first few minutes, the camera stays within a range of 50 centimeters from Saul's face. Or I should say: Saul's head - because sometimes we see only the side or the back of his head.The effect of this style of filming is no less than spectacular. All kinds of things are happening around Saul. Horrible things, we soon learn. But we never get to see them close by. We only see shapes, out of focus, at the extreme fringes of the screen, and we hear the sounds. And we keep seeing his face, in focus. He moves around, works, does things, and all the while all we see is his face.Soon we understand where he is: in a Nazi concentration camp. Saul belongs to a Sonderkommando, a group of Jews who are temporarily spared from death to do the labour the Germans don't want to do. In the midst of the terrible atrocities, it becomes his mission to bury a boy he believes is his son.This film is unique in showing the concentration camp for what is is: hell on earth. Naked dead bodies being dragged around, desperate people being shot indiscriminately, complete absence of anything humanity stands for. It is exactly this total loss of dignity that drives Saul in his hopeless quest for a way to organize a proper burial for the dead boy.Son of Saul is the complete antithesis of that other monumental Holocaust movie: Schindler's List. While Spielberg's film is made according to all the rules of good film making, Son of Saul is a claustrophobic trip, without any possible concession to commercial appeal. The dialogue is often hardly comprehensible, spoken in three languages, sometimes not louder than a whisper. Not all the acts and events are quite clear, and only after a while you understand what exactly drives Saul.This is a unique, hard-hitting movie experience. When you go see it, don't expect a well-rounded story with heroes and villains and a nice ending. But expect to be swept away."
8,Son of Saul,4,7 May 2016,Son of Saul evokes mixed feelings,"An excellent production depicting the grim reality of Hitler's concentration camps, focusing on the story of Saul, an inmate seeking some return to normal human existence in the context of his horrible life and soon impending death.I couldn't help thinking that Saul was nuts (which is true) in his totally futile, and compulsively driven, quest for a return to normalcy in his life. Particularly when this nutty behavior on Saul's part compromised the efforts of the other inmates to deal with their terrible situation in a rational matter that offered some real hope instead of Saul's delusionally and emotionally based actions that were totally empty acts.The conflict here is between rational attempts toward success as demonstrated by the other inmates as a group, and Saul's impeding their efforts with his individual selfish and psychotic actions that only provide for his temporary emotional (but no real lasting) fulfillment.Not sure why the critics, or anyone else, loved this one."
9,Son of Saul,6,30 April 2016,A bit disappointing to be honest,"This movie is not taken on lightly as an audience member. To classify it as 'entertainment' would certainly be wrong because the subject matter is so uncompromisingly challenging.I wanted to love it unreservedly for the bravery of its content but I'm afraid I was left a little cold. The film is shot in square format (possibly 4:3) which is immediately disarming and unusual (the last time I saw this was in the very different Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel) and it's used effectively because it gives the viewer a voyeuristic look into the mayhem that is Dachau where the movie is set. It also helps the director from a budgetary point of view because it eschews the need for expensive wide shots.The opening scenes are astonishingly harrowing as we see the ""pieces"" of Jewish bodies essentially processed through the factory of death with disturbing, off screen, dog barks, German soldier orders and mechanical noise. It's brutal and affecting in the extreme.In some ways this is what I grotesquely wanted from the movie. I wanted to be horrified like no horror movie could achieve. Forgive me for this but it didn't happen. Yes, the mood was grotesque thanks, in particular, to the extraordinary sound design, but on screen I felt it shirked its potential too much.In the end this voyeuristic cinematography ultimately becomes both tiresome and limiting.The fundamental weakness of the movie, in my opinion, is in the storyline. Frankly it's not that credible and doesn't stack up. The main protagonist (Saul) discovers his (illegitimate?) son as a gas chamber survivor and smuggles him out of the situation to seek a Rabbi to give him a proper Jewish burial. This leads to a sequence of events that side stories with an undercover camp breakout in which he is also inexplicably involved.Sorry, it's not credible.And Géza Röhrig as the lead didn't really do it for me. And so the early wonderment of the movie, it really is very moving, starts to erode and gradually descends into incredibility.I love what this movie stands for. I respect every iota of it.I just didn't think it was particularly good overall."
10,Son of Saul,6,8 November 2015,I got irritated,"The first 30, 40 minutes of the movie are absolutely brilliant and moving. What a great idea to focus on one man and keep all the atrocities vague. It is no problem to fill in all the gaps yourself. Great sounds. But later on in the movie it gets difficult to still understand the protagonist. Maybe he is really getting crazy - which I would understand - like another reviewer states. But his way of doing gets annoying at a certain point. Also some scenes are not very clear. At the end, Saul started to irritate me. Jeopardizing the lives of others. My main problem with this movie is: it is a movie, not a documentary. The immensity of the Holocaust can't function as a laissez-passer for a weak script."
11,Son of Saul,3,29 April 2016,What a disappointment,What an utter failure. About 90% of this movie is spent staring at the back of the main characters head as he navigates Auschwitz. The story line was very one noted and not very clear.OK so maybe the camp was accurate including details and all that but how hard is that really to attain? What does it matter anyway if the story isn't interesting.. Essentially it's about a guy that is at the end of his rope and for some reason or another decides that a young boy is his son. He then spends the rest of the movie like Hansel and Gretel searching for a Rabbi. Behind that story is shown some hints about a revolt that is going to take place. That's all.I couldn't wait for this movie to be over.
12,Son of Saul,4,10 April 2016,The Academy got it wrong (again),"""Son of Saul"" or ""Saul fia"" is a Hungarian film from last year that won big at Cannes and also took home the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. And in my opinion, the got it wrong again. ""ida"" was already a pretty weak winner last year and same goes for ""Son of Saul"". It looks to me as if people are appreciating this film because of the difficult and controversial subject. But this alone should not be enough. A film also has to tell a compelling story and this one does not I think. The film runs for slightly over 100 minutes and most of it, actually everything except the ending, takes place in a concentration camp. Another thing about this movie why it was so successful is that the ending is pretty memorable and dramatic and makes it easy to forget about the boredom from the previous 1.5 hours.But I will not. The writer and director here is László Nemes and he is still pretty young, under 40, so we may hear a lot more from him in the future. i cannot say, however, that this film makes me curious about other projects from him. Lead actor is Géza Röhrig and he is completely new to acting it seems. Taking this into account, he did a pretty good job. I have read people say he should have been nominated for an Oscar, but I cannot agree with that. Still, it was a fairly convincing performance and he carried the film nicely from start to finish, given he was in pretty much every scene from start to finish. It is not his fault that the movie did not turn out so well. The problem is one that I just mentioned. Rührig is in every scene and the camera is always extremely close to him. I found this style of direction pretty unappealing, almost annoying at times. You can see the filmmaker's intention to let the audience perceive the action exactly like the protagonist does, but for me it did not work. This was a major turnoff for me here and I may have liked the film better with another approach by Nemes. But I have seen an older short film by him and it seems that he frequently takes this path. All in all, I do not recommend ""Son of Saul"". The protagonist's story was interesting only on a couple occasions, but not enough for such a long film and in terms of historic context we learn nothing here that we did not already know about concentration camps and WWII history if we have only very basic knowledge. Thumbs down."
13,Son of Saul,10,25 November 2015,Astonishing,"This film is an astonishing tour-de-force. I don't recall seeing anything like it before.Fictions set in Nazi concentration camps need to be handled very carefully indeed if they are not to diminish, even trivialise, what took place there. Such films are difficult to criticise, because their subject matter is not only historical fact, it is also the ultimate depravity of human beings. Art must deal with it, because nothing can lie outside of art's sphere, but really it is not a fit subject for bad art, such as Spielberg's Schindler's List. With its beautifully-played violin theme and its clever girl-in-the-red-coat in a black-and-white film, Spielberg used the vocabulary of a Hollywood movie to present this profound subject. Nothing that even its very committed actors could do was able to ground the piece in a convincing reality. The result, as far as I was concerned, in spite of what I'm sure were the best of intentions of the director and his team, was little short of repulsive.Since seeing Schindler's List I have steered clear of films attempting to depict life in the camps. I haven't seen Life is Beautiful, for example, nor The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. For all I know, they are works of genius. Son of Saul definitely is: not only does it not betray the cruelty, the tragedy of the camps, it brings it home in such a vivid way that it is sometimes extremely difficult to watch. But it is necessary to watch. In fact, it must be watched more than once, because it is not only emotionally draining, it is also amazing technically, but because it sweeps you up in its reality, it is impossible to take in the technical achievements on only one viewing.Son of Saul was directed by László Nemes, written by Mr Nemes and Clara Royer, and photographed unnervingly by Mátyás Erdély. Saul himself is incarnated by Géza Röhrig, superbly leading an excellent ensemble."
14,Son of Saul,10,18 October 2015,It is a film that should not be missed,"While no movie can fully capture the madness of what life in a concentration camp must have been like, Làszlò Nemes' Cannes Grand Prize Award winning Son of Saul, his first feature film, may come close to recreating the experience. Written by the director and Clara Royer and shot in 35mm with a 4:3 aspect by cinematographer Mátyás Erdély (""Miss Bala""), Son of Saul explores the moral dilemma of a group of Hungarian Jews known as the Sonderkommandos who were forced to collaborate with the Germans at Birkenau in exchange for preferential treatment in the way of food and living arrangements, even though the bargain extended their lives for only a few months.Set in 1944 only months away from liberation, Géza Röhrig is Saul Auslander, a Sonderkommando, inducted on his arrival at Auschwitz-Birkenau under the threat of death and given the task of emptying train loads of new prisoners, telling them lies about fresh coffee and an offer of employment after their shower, then, under the supervision of the SS, shutting the doors and standing to one side, listening to the screaming and crying. Saul's job does not end there, however. He is charged with removing the bodies, referred to as ""pieces,"" from the gas chambers, confiscating any valuables they may have, and incinerating them in outdoor pits.With the camera always focused on Saul, breathing down his neck like the Dardenne Brothers' camera in ""The Son"", he moves around swiftly going from one job to the next showing little outward emotion among the confusion. He stops long enough, however, to witness the body of a young boy still breathing after having survived the gas chamber. He will not remain alive for long, however, as he is quickly smothered by the camp doctor and his body removed for an autopsy. Apparently recognizing the boy and claiming him to be his son, Saul's seeks a Rabbi who will say the prayer for the dead (Kaddish) and give the boy the required burial according to Jewish law and tradition.When he is not performing business as usual, Saul's desperate attempt to find a Rabbi takes up much of his time and he is accused by a fellow prisoner of being more concerned with the dead than with the living. Though there is no narration and a minimum of dialogue (spoken in a mix of Hungarian, German, and Yiddish), Saul's expressive face reveals a cauldron of intense emotion, more than any language could hope to reveal. We never learn anything about Saul's background, whether he was married or even had a son, but, in his desire to provide Kaddish for the boy, he is asserting his humanity in the face of barbarism.It is a daunting task given the circumstances of the arrival of more victims daily, and the clandestine plans being made for a prisoner rebellion, an extraordinary example of physical resistance but it is Saul's singular act of rebellion that adds a dimension to the suffering that transcends its apparent meaninglessness. Unlike Tim Blake Nelson's 2001 film, ""The Grey Zone"" which covered similar territory but succumbed to standard Hollywood treatment, Nemes keeps graphic content to a minimum and relies on the viewer's imagination, wisely letting the horrors to be assimilated through suggestion and an intentionally raucous soundtrack. Son of Saul is not an easy film to watch, but it is an important and even a necessary one and, in its own way, both a horrifying and strangely beautiful one. It is a film that should not be missed."
15,Son of Saul,10,18 June 2015,A fine holocaust masterpiece,"""Saul fia"" is a Hungarian masterpiece. It presents the holocaust from a very particular point of view. Before, cinema presented this horrible spot of the mankind from a ""global"" angle. Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" for instance takes care basically of the global fate of the people in the death camps. In contrary, ""Saul fia"" focuses to the individual, hence we see (or we suspect) all the horrible events through the eyes of Saul, a Sonderkommando member. These people (chosen from the Jews) actually do the dirty jobs, the ones which are even worse than the death itself: they have to witness the killing of their own family members and friends, then burn the corps, clean the gas chambers and even shovel the ashes into a river. One can find no words, indeed. During the whole film, we are on tenterhooks and one hopes that a salvation shall come for these people. The only ""redemption"" that Saul found is to bury decently the corps of a young boy, that he recognizes as his own son. Actually the boy survives the gas chamber and he is killed ""manually"" by some German doctors in front of Saul. No words, again. The desperate search of Saul for a rabbi gives a sort of meaning for his life, which has already been burned together with the others in the fire, even though physically he still lives. Despite the fact that the Sonderkommando members shall be liquidated soon, he keeps looking for a rabbi. Even when there is chance to escape, he doesn't leave the body of the boy behind. Hundreds of thousands are killed, burned and can be left behind, but this boy is special. We shall never know for sure if he was Saul's son, but even dead, he gives an immense power and motivation for Saul. Telling this unbelievable story that shows the upper limit of the cruelty of the man and the disregard of the human life, this movie remains a fine masterpiece. László Nemes has profound ideas, the movie showed that he deserved the Grand Prix at Cannes. Géza Röhrig is a very deep person, who can share something more, something personal as a message of the film. The cinematography is amazing, one has the feeling that there are almost no cuts, the camera just follows Saul everywhere. These show also some similarities in my opinion with Iñárritu's ""Birdman"". This special style has born in the last years and in my opinion it is very interesting to see it independently in different contexts, in two different parts of the world. It is a very-very painful, and a very deep movie. I hope that we shall hear about it also during the next Oscar nominations."
16,Son of Saul,9,11 September 2015,TIFF 2015 -- Son of Saul: Expect a little more than an education,"Easily tagged as a Holocaust film (but shouldn't necessarily be), 'Son of Saul' explores the perspective of a Sonderkommando named Saul  a German Nazi death camp prisoner who's job was to aid with the disposal of gas chamber victims  who finds a dying boy from the chambers and attempts to give him a proper burial who he claims to be his son, all during his time at Auschwitz. The film is uniquely shot from an over-the-shoulder perspective that keeps the viewer entirely focused on Saul, but still with the motions and actions surrounding him very noticeable (thanks to absolutely brilliant sound work in order to help achieve the eerie feel). 'Saul' reaches certain pinnacles of significant discomfort during scenes of execution  in the gas chambers and the burial pits  and a stone-faced Saul can do nothing but be forced to listen or watch. At points, the viewer feels claustrophobic when being ushered from the trucks in the middle of the night to one's fate. While the main story of Saul's attempt to give his ""son"" a proper Jewish burial is what drives him  already accepting his own fate  the film goes beyond the typical WWII Holocaust story where you might only hear of incidents. In this film, the viewer is thrust upon into the fray of Hell, constantly following Saul through several one-shot takes that leave you wondering what is waiting for him. A word to the wise: this film prides itself on authenticity, realism, and truth; 'Son of Saul' is painfully poetic."
17,Son of Saul,3,13 March 2016,A pointless film about an unreasonable guy,"Because the camera is stuck near the head of Saul the whole time, and most things are out of focus, the film makes you dizzy already after 20 minutes. The film is not really telling anything, just follows a guy who behaves unreasonably. There is nothing explained, you have to fill everything with your own knowledge of the holocaust. That is all what happens, there is nothing concrete in this movie. I am Hungarian, so I was happy one of our films got famous, but it seems that it became true what I was afraid of, it got the Oscar only because it is about the holocaust. therefore it was a big disappointment. Don't waste your time, watch another Hungarian or another holocaust movie depending why did you chose this one."
18,Son of Saul,6,31 January 2016,"First-time Hungarian director's effort ably captures atmosphere of Nazi genocide, but lacks dramatic conflict","First-time Hungarian director László Nemes has been quoted as saying that he didn't want to make a film like Spielberg's Schindler's List, which he dubbed too ""conventional."" Nemes insisted on creating a different kind of Holocaust drama, where the emphasis was not on the survivors but on those who perishedpointing out that surviving the Holocaust was an anomalous affair.Nemes' protagonist is Saul Ausländer, a native Hungarian, who worked as an Auschwitz Sonderkommando (a group of prisoners given special privileges by the Nazis in exchange for assisting them in the extermination procedures and clean-up duties at the camp). Despite being housed away from the crematoriums and given a few extra meager rations, the Sonderkommandos were marked for death when it was deemed they had completed all the work required of them by the Nazis. After the war, some Sonderkommandos were treated as war criminals and shunned by the survivors.Ausländer discovers that one Hungarian boy has survived inside a gas chamber. His life is brief after a Nazi doctor suffocates him and orders an autopsy (to determine why this particular boy had survived). Ausländer insists this boy is his son and arranges to gain possession of the body so he can find a Rabbi to perform a proper burial. Was the boy really his son? At one point, Ausländer states that this was his son from a woman he never married. That kind of statement makes one believe that Ausländer could have been telling the truth. But he could have said that to justify his actions with his fellow inmatesthey of course regarded his belief as a delusion and that he was ""more interested in the dead than the living."" An alternative way of looking at this is that this is how Ausländer could find some measure of redemption inside such a horrific environmentby arranging for the boy to be properly buried, he would be thwarting the Nazis' aim to desecrate the body as well as giving his life some purpose amidst the horror.Nemes' technique is to shoot the entire movie close-up from Ausländer's point of view. The camera never pulls back so we can see the ""bigger picture."" Since everything is shot close-up, we can only catch glimpses of what's happening all around the beleaguered Sonderkommando. We never see the Jewish victims being gassed inside the crematorium. But we can hear their screams and terrifying pounding on the steel door as Ausländer stands right in front of it. Glimpses of the bodies (called ""pieces"" by the Sonderkommandos) are briefly seen being pulled out of the gas chamber and Ausländer and his associates must clean the blood on the floor so none of the new victims get any wind of what is about to happen to them.Nemes' decision to shoot ""close-up"" has the effect of distancing the audience from the horrors that are not seen directly. In one respect, this distancing effectively makes the horror more palpableif the audience takes in too many horrifying images, they may become numb to it all. On the other hand it defeats Nemes' purpose which is to emphasize the emotional connection with the audiencewe're supposed to be shocked by the inhumanity (not sheltered due to not seeing the ""whole picture""). The 1985 Russian film, Come and See, had a similar ""distancing"" problem the subject matter concerned the massacre of civilians in Belarus by the Nazis and their collaborators. Unlike Son of Saul, Come and See was shot from a distance, not close-up. But the result was the same: the horror was not horrifying enough.The value of films such as Come and See and Son of Saul is that they convey the ""atmosphere"" of genocide. From a distance, one might perceive the Nazis' actions as a macabre carnival where the perpetrators continually enjoy themselves as they commit repulsive, sadistic acts. Nemes also fulfills his promise not to give the wrong impression that the Holocaust was a story of survival. The final, gripping scenes in Son of Saul make it clear that there were virtually no survivors. Ausländer may have found some peace that he was able to save his ""son"" from desecration, but those whom we were rooting for throughout the narrative, are mowed down by Nazi bullets, the sound of which occur effectively off screen.Son of Saul is less effective as a drama due to lack of a singular antagonist. We rarely get to see what the personalities of the perpetrators are like. There is one really telling scene where a Nazi officer mocks Ausländer, dancing around him and speaking in pidgin Yiddish. But for the most part, the Nazis here are faceless entities. It might have been more interesting if their genocidal actions were seen from their point of view.Finally, Ausländer's journey is too one-note and repetitious to be effective. We get the idea of what he is trying to do early onit may be noble but his plan is aimless and ineffectual. Paul Ranier writing in the Christian Science Monitor echoes my sentiments: ""Nemes's Saul- centric stylistics grow wearisome after a while, because Saul, blank- faced throughout, never really comes to life as much more than a symbolic martyr.""Son of Saul is certainly up there with other Holocaust films that depict the horrors from a sensory and auditory perspective. This may be the only way to effectively convey what occurred in the extermination camps. Nonetheless, somehow the human element is missing herewhich of course would involve fleshed-out multi-dimensional protagonists and antagonists, and the conflicts cogently enumerated between them."
19,Son of Saul,4,13 May 2016,Overly Self-Conscious and Void - Like a Child Trying Too Hard at Show-and-Tell,"'Son of Saul' started off with a refreshing burst, but barely a quarter in, it meanders on its own overly self-conscious showiness. It becomes painfully obvious that there's a director and production crew behind it trying too hard to drive the impact and be different, resulting in a showy look-at-me stilted performances from its actors and even the set screams ""wow aren't we just realistic and meticulous in our details"", like a bratty girl twirling her hula-hoop in a vigorously attention seeking manner.The core motivation of Saul in trying to get 'a random son' buried is  nada. The entire essence of this movie pivots on this core 'motivation'. Without it, there is only the mundane uninteresting idiosyncrasy of Saul - drifting in the sea of all the other equally mundane idiosyncrasies, all of which are equally uninteresting. The actors (both the clothed and the naked) are way too healthy and lackadaisically bland in their appearances and attitudes, lacking any anguished sense of desperation and despair. As you watch them and the overly-crafted sets, you can't help but be 'constantly aware' that you are watching actors and extras and movie sets going about their motions as directed. Even the constant background chattering sounds consciously deliberate and staged. And the Nazi officers - another bunch of one-dimensional caricatured bullies  same cartoonish-cardboard ones you find in WWII comedies, action genres, dramas, you name it.Hence, even after over an hour into the movie, there is no immersion of oneself into the proceedings of the plot nor in the characters.The most realistic actors on set are the ones playing the dead bodies, but even then their positioning and the manner in which they are piled and dragged around . overly choreographed. Why did it win the Oscar Best Foreign award? Absolutely no idea - just another no-sense award from Hollywood. Probably it gives the voters a misplaced sense of politically-correct 'artsiness'. 'Son of Saul' has become an obligatory-must-watch-because-its-won-these-bunch-of-awards. A good compelling movie it is NOT. Vain-glorious, and does not impress beyond its first 5 mins of fame."
20,Son of Saul,10,16 November 2015,Harrowing and haunting,"""Son of Saul"" (2015 release from Hungary; 107 min.) brings the story of a Jewish Hungarian man named Saul. Saul works/is forced to work as a ""sondercommando"" in one of the German concentration camps (Auschwitz? Birkenau?). As the movie opens, the camera focuses on Saul as he goes from job to job, leading the next wave of Jewish prisoners towards the gas chambers and closer to their death. Then, miraculously, a young boy survives the gassing. A German doctor quickly smothers the life from the boy, and orders an autopsy. Saul, however, wants to provide a proper burial for the boy and desperately seeks to find a rabbi among the Jewish prisoners who can say the 'kaddish' (burial prayers). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: in my life time I have seen quite a few movies that focus on or relate to the WWII concentration camps. I can honestly tell you, though, that ""Son of Saul"" is a unique film. The primary reason is that (i) the movie is shot in almost 1:1 ration, actually probably more like a 4:3 ratio, and (ii) the camera focuses mostly on Saul, and rarely do we get a full-blown shot of what goes on around him. Not that we don't know, and certainly when you add the outstanding audio-soundtrack, we know all too well that this is living hell, and worse. Bodies are laying about, we hear the furnaces, we feel and recoil as chaos and pure evil unfolds. It all make for a very harrowing movie, but one that is unforgettable. It is often said about the holocaust that we should never forget. Let me tell you: ""Son of Saul"" will make you never forget. Géza Röhrig in the role of Saul brings an epic performance, with little dialogue, but body language that speaks volumes. I am going to go on record right now that ""Son of Saul"" will win Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar in early 2016.I saw ""Son of Saul"" during a recent home visit to Belgium. The early evening screening where I saw this at in Antwerp was attended okay but not great. That is a darn shame, but on the other hand, if you are simply looking for a 'good time at the movies', I don't know that I would recommend this, as it's simply not that kind of movie. On the other hand, if you believe in 'important' movies, and on top of that it happens to be a top-notch quality movie, you cannot go wrong with this, be it at the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Son of Saul"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
21,Son of Saul,3,7 May 2016,"Over rated, depressing and pointless.","The story, and motivations of the lead character are not captivating in anyway. Focusing on one mans desire to bury the body of one of the many children massacred in a concentration camp, there appears to be little or no meaning in any of it. On top of a slow, laborious storyline, this film is highly depressing, and serves no purpose in the world. Great films are supposed to inspire emotion, and preferably more than just sadness. This film is not the great event that some quarters make out. Sometimes, the grittiness of independent, foreign language films catapults their reach and appeal. For me, this film is a classic case of that phenomenon in action."
22,Son of Saul,1,19 October 2015,Should have been a short-film..,"Son of Saul, set in 1944 Auschwitz, follows the walking head of a prisoner for 107 minutes as the head goes from place to place in the camp. In the background of the images recorded, we see the blurry outlines of corpses, blood and people walking about trying to burn as many bodies as they can. With a minor plot involving the lead trying to find a rabbi to bless the body of his son who is not his son, the movie does its best to give us an idea what it must have been like being a member of Specialcommand in Auschwitz. But apart from giving us that idea, the movie offers really nothing else. It could as well have been a 15 minute short and perhaps should have been. After 30 minutes you really get the idea and wish for the film to finally take some direction and to stop sporting only horrible imagery and morally bankrupt circumstances. It never does however, which turns the entirety of it into little more than a brutal test of one's patience. A real shame considering the subject matter it portrays."
23,Son of Saul,10,20 August 2015,"Captivated by story about what it is to be human, and speechless before the sight of the Holocaust suffering","The movie is a strong audio-visual and emotional representation of what it was supposed to be like living in a concentration camp during the Holocaust. The senses are bombarded with loud sounds, screams, scenes flash before us, ghastly scenes of pain, suffering, hatred, inhumanity. Saul appears from within that stress of constant nerve-wrecking pressure, death and sorrow, as a flower blooming on a deserted field, with his obsession to fulfil an obligation, a mitzva. Suddenly the entire life that until then seemed so pitiful, impossible and desolate, that was run according to the strict rules and punishments of others, now has a purpose.The acting is amazing, that gaze of the eyes of the actor Géza Röhrig playing Saul, the entire expression of all emotions is channeled through those eyes. Those deep dark eyes of his that will haunt me.The portrayal of the concentration camp is so painfully ""true-to-life"" that you are on the verge of wanting to leave and run away.And that is one of the strongest qualities of the movie: on one hand, you are on the edge of the chair with the discomfort of experiencing the concentration camp, yet on the other hand, you are hooked on Saul's obsession and you are cheering inside yourself and praying for the completion of the obligation he has set himself.I am an amateur in the film industry, a mere fan for over 30 years, but I have rarely been shaken as by this one.At the end of the screening at the Sarajevo Film Festival, I looked around to see a full-theatre now almost empty, save for a few shell-shocked individuals like me, not surprisingly including Atom Egoyan. Genocide trauma is handed down through generations and our own exploration of the past."
24,Son of Saul,9,29 February 2016,"Horrifying, Unbearable, Unique and Wholly Phenomenal.","Few movies have affected me on such a deep and emotional level like Son of Saul. I walked into the theater having no idea what the subject matter was, or read any reviews, so I wasn't sure what to expect. What I witnessed was one of the most difficult and trying pieces about the Holocaust, and a bond between father and son during the most horrific circumstances.By now, many of you have read about the unique style and focus of the film. Shot in 35mm, each shot does not fill the screen. There is only one focal point throughout the film, which means people and objects that are close to the camera are in focus, and everything in the background remains out of focus (except for a few shots where we do not center on Saul). This unique and somewhat unprofessional style is an absolute benefit to the overall story that unfolds before the audience. I was sometimes glad that you couldn't see some of the horrors that were happening all around the main character, but you can tell very plainly what's happening.The story is actually a short one, it takes place in only about a day and a half, but the content of this story is what makes it stand out so brilliantly. Most films about the genocide of the Jewish race during the holocaust have a very broad perspective, showing multiple events to various people who were living through one of the worst horrors man has ever inflicted upon man. Usually these films, like ""Schindler's List"" focus on some savior and the survivors of such events, or even worse movies like ""Heart's War"" which fictionalizes a history that is almost insulting to watch. Son of Saul is a much more personal and heart-wrenching story of one prisoner who works under a Sonderkommando labour groups within the walls of Auschwitz Birkenau. There is a definition of such groups at the beginning of the film, and it tells very plainly what their duties were, under threat of death.It is very difficult, or rather naught and impossible, to comprehend the level of horror prisoners had to live through during the extermination of their own race, but that is where this film is most successful. It achieved something that I very rarely experience during a film. This is when I cease to remember that I am at the cinema watching a movie unfold before me, and for quite some time, believe that I am right there, bearing witness to these events. That is the true goal of cinema I believe. To have the viewer in complete empathy with what is happening to the characters as the movie progresses. And I was completely and utterly entranced.This film is not for the faint of heart. It is horrifying and unbearable at times, but is absolutely unique and utterly phenomenal to watch. A fantastic first for both director László Nemes and lead Géza Röhrig.9/10"
25,Son of Saul,2,30 April 2016,Not as Good As Expected.,"Not as good as expected. The movie may be artsy but the storyline stinks. It's is not a documentary, but a fictitious story of Saul, a worker at a camp deciding that a dead boy is his son and what he attempts to go through to bury him is thin. Yes, the scenes in the background are horrific, something the artsy types at film schools like. But the movie is slow, limited dialogue, and a lot of long scenes were so long, you can speed things up with fast forward and miss nothing. Basically the movie falls flat and is a waste of time. I give it two stars because the background scenes that depict the horrors from a perspective of Saul are well done. Do not like the shakiness of a hand-held camera that had to track this perspective throughout the movie, or the full screen format, one can overlook those. Overall there are far better movies about this period such as Black List or the Counterfeiters. And if you really want to learn more about this period pick up the book Mans Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl who chronicled his experiences as an Auschwitz concentration camp. Or Auschwitz: A Doctor's Account by Dr. Miklos Nyiszli who was spared from death because he was personal assistant to Dr. Josef Mengele, known as the infamous ""Angel of Death."" These are real stories by real people. There huge difference between this type of reality (the books) and a fictitious movie."
26,Son of Saul,6,30 January 2016,Fantastically crafted.,"I feel guilty for posting this review, for I think Saul fia is brilliant in many ways, and I want more film makers to experiment, and tell their stories in a creative and original fashion, like László Nemes.There are some minor spoilers in this review, but not any that would ruin the movie for you.The part of the movie which will probably get the most attention is the way that almost the entire image (which is small, ""academy ratio"") is at all times mostly focused on Géza Röhrig's character Saul. The camera follows Saul more closely than you have seen in a movie before, often leaving very little room for other than his head. The most obvious reason for making the movie this way is that it forces you to ""complete"" the setting using the sounds provided. Even though you do get some good looks at the horrible things happening at the concentration camp - I'm sure you will remember much more than what is actually shown on the screen. If this had been the sole reason for filming this way, it would have been a really good and memorable gimmick. But you can also see how this helps tell the story of Saul. Saul has been mentally weakened by the time he has spent in the camp. We don't learn too much of his back story, but we learn enough to know he has been in better condition than he is as the movie starts. The Saul you meet from the beginning of the movie seems all alone in the world. He blocks out the others (and the travesty happening around him), resulting in an entirely selfish personality. This is reflected by the way the movie is shot, because in the screen you see only what he sees: Himself.Another thing I really liked about this movie is how real it all felt. Obviously I do not know much about how life really was like in the camps, but the way this movie handled it felt real. Previous movies I have seen about the time spent in concentration camps makes it seem like everything is organized and controlled, but in this movie, the chaos of it all makes it all seem more real. And all the extras feel like they are supposed to be there, and have been given clear instructions on what to do. For a movie that leaves so much of the background to the imagination, they really did work hard to make what it shown pretty much flawless.So why do I only give it 6 out of 10? I am not sure. By focusing on an ""anti-hero"", the other prisoners seem all the more human, as they are almost always friendly with Saul, despite the things he does. But at the same time, I completely lost interest in Saul's project, his motivations and how his story would end. To me, the movie only works if you look away from what's in the dead center of it - Saul - and it might be that I am not a good enough watcher to be able to do this. I appreciate the film and can completely understand those who love it. But because I can not help myself from focusing on Saul's story, I was often times bored with the movie. I do not mind Saul being an unsympathetic character, and I'm fine with him being an anti-hero. But I wish he had traits that made him more compelling to watch. Because I can't be more specific than that, I'm also open to me not being a sophisticated enough watcher."
27,Son of Saul,5,15 December 2016,"In spite of all the awards, this is Holocaust porn","So this won the Cannes Grand Prix and the Golden Globe and Oscar for foreign film. So this must be a truly excellent film, especially since so many people here seem to be of that opinion, right? I admit: technically, this is a new approach to the theme, in which the face of the protagonist reflects all what is happening around him, and in which an excellent, well-thought sound design carries over the horrors that remain at the edges of the frame. And yet, I'm one of the handful of reviewers who are rather disappointed.I admit this is because of my partial Romani heritage. At this point, especially with what's been going on in Europe (and particularly Hungary) over the past years, a film that manages to give passing reference to gay and Soviet Auschwitz inmates - and STILL ignores the presence of Sinti and Roma - isn't just unconsciously overseeing the issue. Romani organizations weren't happy with ""Schindler's List"" back in the day, pointing out that the realistic approach Spielberg chose eradicated an essential part of Romani history. I thought that critique too harsh - ""Schindler's List"" is a masterpiece of storytelling and it would not have been part of the story to include references to Birkenau II. This film, however, could have easily avoided this negligence, and if you find it hard to understand why anyone should be mad about that, I suggest you watch another Hungarian film, ""Just the Wind"" (2012). That one gives you an idea of the perpetual hell of Romani existence.Yet like a number of German critics also pointed out, what really gives me the creeps about ""Son of Saul"" is the frame composition, with ample use of naked bodies out of focus, and an extensive use of nudity as a symbol of helplessness. I cannot help but agree that this constitutes Holocaust pornography. The images are carefully constructed to elicit shock, yet do not contribute to the story - as was the case in ""Schindler's List"". The film is carried by the structural idea, which is not at all an original one, but reminiscent of classic Hungarian cinema - particularly ""Red Psalm"" (1972) by Miklós Jancsó and the work of Béla Tarr, whom this director assisted.The story, simple as it is, is in fact unrealistic if you go by the memoirs of Roman Frister or Lucie Adelsberger (to name just a few) since there was no freedom of movement corresponding to what you see in this film. The pointlessness of the protagonist's actions, clear to all around him as well as himself, also run contrary to what I've read from survivors, who very clearly describe what animated them and what the dynamics within the inmates were. So if you've not read any books and haven't watched any testimonials or documentaries, I'm afraid this film can easily misguide your perceptions of what the Holocaust was, and deliver and imprint so strong that it may be hard to challenge by more factual depictions. Yet this is of course an extremely important work in the negative sense, in that it shows just how easily content can be styled to elicit a specific response and garner an avalanche of awards.Perhaps my judgment would not be this harsh if this wouldn't ring so close, and if Hungary wouldn't have the human rights record it has under Orbán. But considering the film culminates in an uprising - if you've devoted some time to the study of Auschwitz, you may understand why I cannot help but wonder when, finally, will there be a film about May 16th, 1944 in Birkenau II. It's very much needed, and the story is so powerful that it wouldn't require as much technical finesse."
28,Son of Saul,5,30 November 2016,"Please, I can see something.","This is a film in which the director has decided to destroy it with his address. It could be a movie since the actors are very well, everyone, well let's say the Jews, because the truth is that those who interpret Germans do not know. It gets so much into the nape of the head that not only do not see many things that happen but if we did not already know the story of what happened, the Nazis would pass almost unnoticed, bone, does not give you the option to see how bad were.It's a shame because the film would be great, it has enough material to make it great. The idea is for everyone to identify but I at least can not get into the movie, with that camera that does not let me see anything.This makes it cold, but not because the photo, which is not a wonder, is, if not because it does not reach you at all. At least it does not transmit anything to me.As I said the address is very bad, the photo, little thing, only save the makeup, the hairdresser and the wardrobe and is that apart from costing a lot of money is quite easy.In short, after a long disappointment"
29,Son of Saul,10,1 April 2016,The Haunting Portrait of a Man,"Son of Saul is a movie that has peaked my interest ever since it won the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival. It also got me more excited to watch it after its wins for Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globes, Spirit Awards and the Oscars. After watching Son of Saul I was emotionally drained. Son of Saul captivates with its depiction of the human spirit struggling to keep itself alive in the most darkest moments in history. Son of Saul is one of the greatest achievements in cinema with how it is able to make a cinematic experience of one of the most disturbing times in history.Son of Saul follows Hungarian Jew concentration camp prisoner Saul in Auschwitz who is part of a separate section of the camp that's forced to corral other prisoners into gas chambers and burn the bodies afterwards. Saul finds the body of a boy who may or may not be his son and he goes throughout the entire movie to find a rabbi to give the boy a proper burial. What I loved about this movie is that they don't go out of their way to show a horrible gross out scene with people burning. I've heard some people criticize this film by saying it shied away from showing the horrors of the Holocaust when in fact the reason they keep this stuff in the literal background is because that's not the main focus. I'll get more into that with cinematography but I really liked how instead of saying, ""The Holocaust was a bad thing and here's why."" it was focusing more on the story it was telling and I love this movie more for doing that.The acting and performances in this film are spectacular. Everyone was great in this film and actually felt like they are in the Holocaust. The standout is Géza Röhrig. He brings a powerful performance as Saul and has the best performance of last year. There are shots in this movie that stay for a long while on his face and just by his face and body language we can tell so much about him. Saul is a broken man in a broken world. He's trying to recover what little of his spirit he still has and Röhrig portrays that phenomenally.But what really shines is László Nemes' direction. A pet peeve I have with movies is when people have a conversation with someone in a loud crowd and you're able to hear every single word clearly. While you can understand what they're saying you can hear the conversations happening around them. I applaud Nemes for being that detail oriented when directing this film.The cinematography is stellar. It's framing is done extremely well and really goes up close and personal with our main character. The unique thing about the cinematography is that everything around Saul is out of focus so that we can solely concentrate on what Saul is feeling. When I was talking about why people criticized the framing and shying away from showing the horrors of the Holocaust the cinematography really gives away why that is. Since it's all in the perspective of Saul it shows how hard Saul is trying to ignore the horrors that are happening around him. Wouldn't you be doing the same thing if you had Saul's job? The point of this is to not show the whole experience of the Holocaust but one man's experience as he tries to bury a little boy who may or may not be his son.Son of Saul captures the human spirit at its most vulnerable in a new way that other films should look at and marvel. By far one of the crowning achievements of 2015 that helps cement that year as one of the best years in film history. One of the most important films to view and required viewing for all. Son of Saul amazes at every frame to show the triumph of the human spirit."
30,Son of Saul,,19 December 2015,Existence at the twilight of life,"'Son of Saul' is not for the faint of heart. Laszlo Nemes's narrative and camera breathe life into the daily life of 'Sonderkommando' or work units, mainly made up of Jews, who, with the threat of death, forced to clean up after the gassing, the incineration of bodies, the cataloging and warehousing of clothing, shoes, eye glasses, jewelry, money, and the like of the victims of the Holocaust. We are in an endless coming and going of tasks and orders, as though the Nazis had recreated an ant hill of special units to go about the defined tasks of extermination. And even these Jews momentarily spared, have a short life span for they too will go to the gas chambers, replaced by fresh bodies, who, in turn, would,too, end up as ash or buried in pits. ""Son of Saul' is a buzz of rumor, as though it were a parliament of symphony of harsh, discordant sounds in many languages in the background as Saul and his fellow worker ants work incessantly at tasks, any, and always at the whim of the Germans or Kapos, the more privileged prisoners who supervise the prisoners. And into the world of exhausted drabness melancholic and eroded of spirit, a young boy who by miracle survives the gassing. But not for long since a Nazi doctor suffocates him; orders his autopsy to know how and why he survived where none have before. In this young boy Saul sees a son, a son he never had, but a Jewish soul mate whom he wants to bury according to Jewish ritual--no postmortem examination, no incineration--a recitation of Kaddish for the dead and burial in the earth with a body intact. And so in this sinister environment, Saul go in search of a rabbi to perform the funeral rites. In his quest, the camera in all its greyness takes us into the life of Sonderkommando, the plotting to escape, the taking of photographs so that still life photos will be witness to the hell that was the final solution; the bribery, the brutality, the smug violence of kapo and Nazi. And yet, in secret some Sonderkommando manage to celebrate the Sabbath in an abbreviated form. Yet, that is a simple pleasure in a day or night that is at the beck and call of aiding the Nazi in the destruction of the Jews and other despised races of Europe. It is a world without relaxation; we squirm with the work units as they remove gassed bodies, scrub floors and walls of gas chambers ready to receive another batch of Jews. And so it went until the Russians liberated the camps, but that's another film I would be churlish to give away the end, inevitable that it is. Nemes is fascinated as he is horrified by the Sonderkommando, unwilling or willing tools of mass destruction. After seeing the film, we can see why the 2015 Palme D'or at Cannes went to Nemes' film."
31,Son of Saul,10,25 June 2015,This is not a holocaust movie. This movie is about eternal human problems and conflicts.,"The first 15 minutes was very though and unbelievably shocking. The 'in medias res' beginning warns you that your life can change in a moment, in one moment someone says you that they need you and you will get a cup of tea, just take a shower, then everything will be fine, and in the very next moment you are dead. And all the people around you. This is the first important message of the movie for me: nothing - good or bad - is eternal. Anything can disappear in a moment. Even your life or everything you believed in.The cinematography is classic and brand new at once. The 4:3 ratio and the concept of concentrating on the faces and the human beings, not on the grand total of the death camp in the background is just another tool of putting the movie away from holocaust and the death camps, and you can imagine that this story can happen in any other cruel situations and at any time.For me it was unclear whether it was son of Saul or not. I suppose not. I suppose it was another psychological effect of the circumstances: finding a purpose when you realize that your life does not count anymore: picking a boy, telling yourself that it is your son, and you have duties about him.It is also a movie about the difficulty of choosing between the purposes of an individual and the group. What has more importance? Your last individual goals when you feel that everything (even your life) is lost or trying to help the group saving the situation? Another question: was this a real choice? Did it make any sense? Are you supposed to choose? Are you supposed to help the group? Are you supposed to give yourself up for the aims of the group? (These are very 21st century questions, which also puts the movie away from the holocaust topic.)This is not a holocaust movie. This is a movie about being a human being within inhuman circumstances and finding a final goal in life when you realize that your life cannot last for more than a few days. It is a masterpiece.I don't like to tell about any movie or books that this a ""must to be seen"" or ""must to be read"", because if you make something obligatory, it may not have the supposed effect. But this movie is an exception. This movie is a must for everyone. All over the world."
32,Son of Saul,1,8 November 2016,"Pretentious, unreal, idiotic, awful","I saw this film today and I totally didn't like it. Awful, idiotic and pretentious. There is this Jew prisoner who wants to give a dead boy a proper burial. That's right, right there in the concentration camp. Are we supposed to believe this? And even if that could happen how are we to relate to that completely insane and idiotic person? Well some people liked it! OK I haven't served as a prisoner in a concentration camp but I can think of a couple things I could do there and giving a boy a proper burial is not one of them. I could maybe try to escape, revolt or just provoke them to kill me. Also in most films taking place in WWII all Germans and mean literally everyone is bad or worse. This film of course is no exception. At least in ""the pianist"" there was one German who treated the protagonist nicely."
33,Son of Saul,8,10 November 2015,Son of Saul (Saul fia),"-Son of Saul (Hungarian: Saul fia) is a 2015 Hungarian drama film directed by László Nemes. It was screened at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix. It has also been selected to be shown in the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.--Critical reception: -Upon its release at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, the film was met with wide critical acclaim. In his review for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw rated the film five out of five stars, calling it an ""astonishing debut film"" and ""a horror movie of extraordinary focus and courage"". He ended his review writing: ""Nemes's film has found a way to create a fictional drama with a gaunt, fierce kind of courage  the kind of courage, perhaps, that it takes to watch it."" -Writing for Time Out, Dave Calhoun also gave the film five out of five stars. Indiewire's Eric Kohn awarded the film an A- rating, calling it ""a remarkable refashioning of the Holocaust drama that reignites the setting with extraordinary immediacy"". -In his review written for The Hollywood Reporter, Boyd van Hoeij praised the cinematography and the soundwork of the film. He writes: ""Shot (and shown in Cannes) on 35mm, often in sickly greens and yellows and with deep shadows, Erdely's cinematography is one of the film's major assets, but it wouldn't be half as effective without the soundwork, which plays a major role in suggesting what is happening around Saul, with audiences often forced to rely on the sound to imagine the whole, horrible picture."" -Writing for The Film Stage, Giovanni Marchini Camia gave the film an A rating, and called it ""a towering landmark for filmic fictionalizations of the Holocaust"". -On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 94% approval rating based on reviews from 34 critics, with an average rating of 8.7 out of 10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Grimly intense yet thoroughly rewarding, Son of Saul offers an unforgettable viewing experience -- and establishes director László Nemes as a talent to watch."" -On Metacritic, the film has received a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 based on 10 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"". -Claude Lanzmann, director of the documentary Shoah, lauded Nemes after seeing the film."
34,Son of Saul,8,24 January 2016,Outstanding film about concentration camps and the terrifying assignment  carried out by  a SonderKommando,"Impressive movie about concentration camp with realist setting , top-notch acting and evocative cinematography in 35 mm . The film was met with wide critical acclaim after its world premiere and has subsequently been submitted as Hungary's official entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards . This excellent movie deals with the horror of 1944 in Auschwitz , the infamous extermination center , capturing an insightful portrait of hell and the spiritual experience and focusing the story of a man wanting to bury his assumed son . Thus , when the incoming transports , mostly Jews , SS soldiers made instant decisions , those who were fit to labors were sent into the camp , others including the children , were dispatched immediately to the gas chambers where approximately one-quarter million Jews were executed . There a prisoner , a ¨Sonderkommando¨ is forced to burn the corpses of his own people , then he finds moral survival upon attempting to save from the flames the body of a boy he takes for his son , and he subsequently looks for a Jewish Rabí . At the end takes place a rebellion and a breathtaking , exciting getaway .This terrible picture is well set in Auschwitz , it was a painful extermination camp of killing of Jews including children . We see horrors , murders , massacres against the prisoners but from a particular sight point , the starring : Geza Rohrig , who gives a very good acting with his subjective vision . Along with Geza , there appears a lot of fine but unknown Hungarian actors such as Levente Monar, Urs Rechn, Tood Charmont, Sándor Zsotér, Marcin Czarnik, and Jerzy Walczak , all of them display magnificent performances ; including their realistic mélange of Hungarian, German and Yiddish dialogue . Atmospheric cinematography by Mátyás Erdély , the outside scenes were shot only with natural light , it is fully aware of the quality of light , relying on natural light for outdoors . This Hungarian Cannes prize-winner that won a Golden Globe in the ""Best Foreign Language Film"" category in 2016 and critically heralded Holocaust film began what is likely to be a multi-month run , calibrated in hopes of winning the Foreign Language Academy Award as well as to maximize grossing potent . It is a dark and serious flick , a splendid movie about the brutal existence at concentration camp and subsequent breakout from horrible place . The picture is based on real events , as Auschwitz along with Sobibór , Chelmno , Belzec and Treblinka were five large death camps in the Lublin district of Poland transformed into extermination centers to implement the policy of genocide thought at the Wannsee Conference . All the concentration camps were under the command of SS Odilo Globocnick . There was some minor industrial activity linked to the war effort but the main work was the execution of inmates . Victims were brought to the camp in unventilated transports , and all but a handful were gassed after arrival , the gas chambers could accommodate hundred prisoners at one time , most of their corpses were burned in open pits .Filmmaker Laszlo Nemes , his debut feature , avoids both , melodrama and violence , giving a thought-provoking as well as intense description about the hard existence in Auschwitz . Director László Nemes stated on cinematic inspirations : ¨Come and see¨ (1985) by Elem Klimov was a great source of inspiration for me ; however the film bears remarkable resemblance to ¨The grey zone¨ (201) by Tim Blake Nelson . Nemes took testimony from present witnesses , he made a real investigation labour and had particular help of prestigious historians as Gideon Grief , Philippe Mesnard and Zoltan Vagi . Nemes wanted to convey something that goes against the perception through films, that it is a mixture of organisation and chaos . Lazsló called Nobel prize-winning Hungarian writer and concentration camp survivor Imre Kertész an inspiration to make this film . He took records from known documentary ¨Shoa¨ by Claudie Lanzmann , especially the actual testimony from Abraham Bomba , as well as of the ¨Memorial of Shoa¨ , with a book titled ¨Voices under the ashes¨ also titled ¨The writings of Auschwitz¨ ."
35,Son of Saul,9,10 October 2015,"Some humanity did exist in 1944 Auschwitz, but definitely not from the Nazis","Saul fia (or Son of Saul) is a Hungarian film set in 1944 Auschwitz, about Saul Auslander (Géza Röhrig) who sets upon a personal journey to bury a child, who may or may not be his, instead of exposing that child to the norms of the genocidal extermination that was occurring at that time. Saul fia was the 2015 Grand Prix award winner at the Cannes Film Festival and right away shows us the quality that earned the film it's award. The film is beautifully shot in the standard Academy 4:3 on 35 mm which gives it a very boxed in and very oddly personal feeling to the film, the characters, and the setting. Upon initially seeing the child, Saul is on this mission to bury this child with dignity regardless of the danger that he is exposing himself to. Alongside this, is a side plot of the rest of his Sonderkommando (working clan) who are trying to hatch an escape plan to leave Auschwitz and it's horrors. What is important is that the movie strives not to indulge in the horrors of what is going on in the background but instead focuses on Saul and his story. But that doesn't mean that the director forgets about its surroundings. The DP has taken glancing shots that when something catches Saul's eyes (as this film has a lot of over the shoulder 3rd person POV), the film draws focus on the plight of the Jewish people that are being exterminated in the soulless methods that the Sonderkommando are being forced to use by the Nazi's. But the film is able to balance the way the plot runs between the escape plan with the burial plot by meshing the two plots together in a way where neither plot feels forced. That's entirely due to how Röhrig plays the role of Saul, because he is forced to make deals with members of the Sonderkommando and thus needs to help with the escape plan, but he always reverts his way back to his own storyline. Saul fia is a movie that is sure to resonate with any person who watches it, and will make you think about the struggles and horrors that the Jewish people had to go through during WWII at Auschwitz. As well as showing how the captive Jewish workers at Auschwitz were forced to do these jobs and being absolutely helpless to the people that they had to ""exterminate"". Saul fia gets a near-perfect A"
36,Son of Saul,6,28 August 2016,Maybe there is something that I didn't get.,"One thing can be easily said, it is definitely a great movie. There is a tension build which is so strong that you feel you are there standing right next to Saul. The camera is set as if the director wants the audience to stay with Saul the whole film(almost the whole movie). This helped us analyze every situation which is faced by him. The grave expression on his face tells a story in itself altogether. The background is faded, but you cannot help but notice everything that is going on around him. It is gruesome, but not the one the director wanted you to focus on. The thing which I don't get was the ending. Also, I think there may be some problems with the subtitles I was using because some of the dialogues made no sense at all. That is why i gave it this much. I will surely be watching it again some day because it is one of those movies which you don't forget. Even if you don't get it properly. :)"
37,Son of Saul,9,18 November 2015,Welcome to Auschwitz,"Another year, another Holocaust drama...but what a Holocaust drama it is! This film takes all narrative and cinematographic clichés one usually finds in films of this sort and dumps them straight into the trash. When you think about it, it's quite surprising that a subjective trip through Holocaust hell of this kind has taken so long to be made.The story can be summed up rather quickly: Saul, a Sonderkommando (Jews who were forced to help the Nazi's in the concentration camps), tries to bury his son while his fellow Sonderkommando's are planning an escape. The opening scenes already set the tone as we see Saul being forced to help the Nazi's get the new batch of Jews undressed and into the gas chambers. As the ruckus what's happening behind the 'shower' doors gets louder and louder, the film cuts to a black screen with the film's title. Immediately, this film surpasses Schindler's List with its cop-out of a gas chamber scene. List, while a great piece of cinema in many ways, is in the end a story about a white man growing a conscience. Shoah, it is not. I imagine Spielberg wanted to recreate the Holocaust with a morally decent central narrative to not completely alienate his audience. Son of Saul has a similarly morally decent storyline (Saul trying to properly bury his son), but unlike List puts you smack-dab in the middle of Auschwitz for the duration of the film.The true genius lies in the complete lack of cinematic manipulation. True, film is by its very nature a manipulative medium, but director Nemes presents this most horrific of horrors as authentically as possible. Ninety percent of the film consists of long shots where the camera sticks to Saul as if magnetically drawn to him, while the horrors taking place in the background tend to be out of focus. If Saul isn't looking at it, it's out of focus. The result is a highly subjective journey through Auschwitz. Nemes is also aware of what he can and cannot show: he doesn't pull any punches, but he also doesn't take us into the gas chambers, because he knows it there are some things that must not be seen. There are no typical cinematic tricks here: no establishing shots, no 'artsy' camera angles or filters, no music. It's a refreshing change of pace from how the Holocaust is usually presented.The sound is also crucial to the film's impact. Since much of what we see in the background is out of focus, it's the sound that has to convey the hellhole we find ourselves in. Combined with the long shots, you rapidly become exhausted, so when a quiet scene suddenly appears, it's almost shocking.In terms of acting, I was surprised how minimalist it was. One would expect there'd be all kinds of Big Emotions on display given the characters' circumstances, but it's precisely these circumstances that feed Géza Röhrig's (Saul) performance. Saul has a one-track mind and trying to survive in Auschwitz would lead you to shut everything out, to block out all emotions. Fully expressing yourself would lead to certain death, so Saul internalizes everything, so to speak. It's a very bold move from Nemes who could've easily included lots of Oscar-bait scenes, but didn't.Even Claude Lanzmann, creator of the gargantuan Shoah documentary, who stated that depicting the Shoah is beyond film's capabilities has spoken of his great admiration for Son of Saul. I suppose that's the highest praise one can give to a Holocaust drama: Lanzmann liked it."
38,Son of Saul,5,25 May 2015,"A ""tour"" at the heart of a death camp","For a certain type of people it is of extraordinary importance how some pieces of art (especially if in the focus of a widely spread debate) are being ""judged"", and I'm of this type too. I saw the film under perfect circumstances, except that days before this event I was exposed to a quotation from a review by a fellow journalist working for a major newspaper (and so given access to see the film before the secondary level of the Hungarian press to which I belong, I gladly admit). The quotation from that article was in fact a verdict, stating that ""director Laszlo Nemes not only had caught up on the world's film making but went beyond"". Although it was somewhat disturbing me, the situation was not new to me at all, so, when watching the film I was in a comfortable, open state of mind.My encounter with the movie didn't turn out well though, not only did I not like it, I did not enjoy it either  whereas, however inappropriate this may sound, I enjoyed, I took pleasure in, watching Schindler' list, for example, not the mention the Woman in Gold, the latest Holocaust film-experience I have just had.When one writes a review, I believe, s/he should share her/his experience and give an (esthetic) analysis on why that could have happened the way it did, I mean, the encounter with the given piece of art. As for my analysis, I think I did not like the fact that there was a huge gap between the (focal) ""pane"" of the protagonist, Saul (Géza Röhrig), and the ""background"".This problem that I encountered was not of optical nature, of course. What I didn't like (and still oppose as an idea) was that the working of the Holocaust machinery at the heart of this death camp was a mere background. I don't object the ""banal"" approach (in the Arendt sense), I don't object that it is used as a background, my problem is that it is used as a 'mere' background. I mean, it's just there all the time throughout the whole film, without the protagonist interfering with it. The film does not even disclose his relation to the 'background' happening. He's supposed to be a 'Sonderkommando' member which brings up a whole lot of questions about how he was taking part in that mass murdering there, how he was perceiving that reality, etc, etc. But we get no depiction of his state of mind, of his character  neither of his original character nor that of his 'Sonderkommando' state. For me this was and is a problem. Cause like this, it all breaks down to a weird movie experience in which the main character is coming and going from given point A-s to point B-s, and the viewer is convicted to follow him for the appearance while s/he is actually watching, as s/he's supposed to, the continuous happening in the background.It is obvious that the director wanted the viewer to have this ""tour"" through a death camp, to share this ""banal"" reality from a participant's POV. I have no objections to this. My problem is that in the foreground no such thing takes place which  like in other films  would involve the viewer and offer her/him an opportunity to 'internalize' the experiences of the main on screen characters. Plus, a movie needs a story. And showing a main character wanting to get from point A to a point B is not yet a story: we need to be introduced to his motives, plus we need to be ""informed"" in real time of his state of mind, including his relation to his mission, as well as to the background happening. Last but not least, the foreground story has to be believable and followed, you can't put anything there saying that it's the background what matters anyway. I mean, you can, but this is what  I think  it looks like.As a fellow Hungarian, I should be happy about this film's success, but to my surprise I'm not. I'm happy about this film being made, but not about its immense success, and I know what the case seems to be, but it's not (if it was jealousy, I'd be working on it). The reason why, I think, I don't like this huge success at Cannes is because like this the discussion about this movie is over, it's impossible. It's over before it could even have started, it's over before the film's premier. So, I can only call this another negative case of ""peer pressure"", I think. And as for the film, I only wish that people wouldn't have had a chance to see it for themselves. Then, I believe, it would have had a positive (progressive) impact on the culture."
39,Son of Saul,8,18 January 2016,Silent screaming,"The room is filled to the brim with happy, healthy people aged 20 to 80, who just stocked up on American drinks and candy of all sorts and eagerly await the start of the movie. After some commercials and a trailer, the lights dim and the last conversations between these movie-goers come to a halt. Silence ensues.FESTIVAL DE CANNES / GRAND PRIX, the screen states. The film begins. A seemingly never-ending scene is shown in which we follow the stoic face of a man who walks among hundreds of others, gently prodding them to move along, walk faster, go on. Everyone present in the cinema immediately knows what's going on. Silence continues. The people undress. They are herded into the 'shower' rooms. The doors are shut. The Jews who are forced to help the Nazis murder these people are asked to throw their full bodyweight against the doors, so nobody can escape. Screams, endless screams, envelop the theater. High-pitched children's screams, men's despairing yells, women's cries and sobs. After what seems to be an eternity, the screen cuts to black and the movie title is displayed. The screams fall silent.Filmed in a World War 2-like 4X3 aspect ratio, we continue to follow the protagonist literally head-on for an hour and a half. The 21st- century audience knows the stories, the names of the camps, has read books and seen dozens of movies about the Holocaust. But never like this. Screams alternate with silence, gunshots juxtapose stillness, life rubs in death. And through all of it, the audience is silent.Some gasp and put their hands in front of their mouths, others have the same dead stare the protagonist shows throughout the movie. Most everyone has trouble breathing as the movie grabs them by the throat and does not let go. Silence screams from the throats of every movie- goer present.As the credits roll, nobody talks, but everyone is in a hurry to leave the theater. Everyone wants to escape the living hell they've just experienced for an hour and a half. And everyone is more keenly aware than ever that for 15 million people a mere three generations ago, escape was not an option. The audience was never this silent during any of the hundreds of movies I saw on the silver screen. No coughs, no crunching on chips, no unscrewing of bottles, no talk. Merely silence.As the audience shuffles out of the door, they all realize that silence is all that remains: silence screaming from the theater itself, screaming silence from the screen. They know that no matter how many books, history lessons or movies are made about the subject, it's a silence that still should be screamed, yelled and cried into the world for generations to come."
40,Son of Saul,8,11 October 2015,A Personal Point of View,"Now, I'm no expert on Hungarian cinema, or cinema from any nation to that matter, but the Hungarian cinema I've seen tends to focus more on the darker side of life, be it black comedy or World War II drama. With 'Son of Saul, László Nemes' debut feature, we see an intense drama set in a concentration camp in Auschwitz. Saul is a Hungarian Sonderkommando in a camp, tasked with cleaning up the dead from the gas chambers. When a young boy is found choking when performing their duties, Saul witnesses German soldiers suffocate him. Saul then makes it his mission to give the boy a decent burial, hiding the boy's body while he seeks a rabbi, against the will of his fellow Sonderkommandos, whom plot their escape. 'Son of Saul', therefore is very much a film about an individual, as one man fights against an oppressive regime and his fellow prisoners, in an attempt to feel human again. With this the case, director Nemes chose to film almost from first person perspective, with the camera trained over Saul's shoulder or on his face throughout. Long takes with this cinematography create a very intense and personal experience, as the viewer experiences every step of Saul's journey. In what is a difficult subject matter to tackle, Nemes uses a unique approach to create a very personal film, that the viewer feels every step of the way. It is a film that is cramped, uncomfortable and furious, dynamic and inventive in its approach in what is very good filmmaking from a debuting director. politic1983.blogspot.co.uk"
41,Son of Saul,9,28 February 2016,At once awful and beautiful,"The Sonderkommando, the ""bearers of secrets,"" work between the living and the dead in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Saul Auslander is one among them. He carries bodies, washes blood from gas chamber floors and shepherds the living into flames. He is cold as death himself. Yet something snaps inside him and awakens his heart. Despite being gassed and discarded beneath a heap of bodies, a boy briefly clings to life. Saul, roused to some kind of higher purpose, attempts superhuman feats in order for a Kaddish, a proper funeral rite, to be performed so this boy might have eternal life.At once awful and beautiful. The Holocaust is portrayed in an atypical manner that is up-close and revealing in all its terror and malevolence, yet at the same time the plot and characters are inscrutable and mysterious as the human heart. Camera angles heighten the intensity and impact of the film. The camera is often face to face with Saul. It follows him around the camp, as he collects belongings from the dead, into groves of poplars to attempt an escape and to the river to shovel away the ashes. The adept acting, editing, directing, story and scenes kept me on the edge of my seat during the length of the film. Winner of the Grand Prix at Cannes and at this very moment won an Oscar for best foreign language film."
42,Son of Saul,10,9 February 2016,Amazing Performance,I salute Mr. Geza Rohrig for his exceptional performance and amazing acting. His facial expressions and mindset is perfect for the role and this film brings back the human experience of the holocaust to a new reality. MUST SEE!!!! I recommend this movie to both people who have no background on the issue and even to people of the Jewish faith who would like to understand better the human side of the daily sufferings. Any negative review of this movie came from antisemitic or holocaust denial sources. There is no reason to even entertain those reviews. My recommendations are based on the cinematic magic and the amazing acting skills. The director was definitely thinking outside of the box when creating such a masterpiece. It is definitely Oscar worthy.
43,Son of Saul,10,27 August 2016,A masterpiece that goes deep into the horrors of the Holocaust / A pioneer cinematography and a breathtaking leading performance,"Saul fia is a masterpiece that goes deep into the horrors of the Holocaust. Director László Nemes makes a feature film debut that is spectacular. The camera is astonishing and the performance of Géza Röhrig is breathtaking. Without showing much, we can hear the screams of all of the innocent men, women and children who were massacred and gassed by the Nazi Germans & Austrians. The macabre task of the Sonderkommando is brilliantly depicted in this film.I confess that I cried the first 15 minutes of the movie. Saul fia is really hard to watch, but it is a crucial work of art for this cybernetic and superficial century where the Holocaust seems already out of fashion. The film shows in an unorthodox way the macabre gassing described by the few testimonies of the few Auschwitz Sonderkommando who survived the war (Shlomo Venezia, a Jewish Greek Sonderkommando, prisoner number 182727: Sonderkommando. Dans l'enfer des chambres à gaz; Filip Müller, a Jewish Slovak Sonderkommando, prisoner number 29236: Sonderbehandlung. Drei Jahre in der Krematorien und Gaskammern von Auschwitz; and the shocking drawings by David Olère, a Jewish Polish Sonderkommando). Dario Gabbai, prisoner number 182568, Shlomo Venezia's cousin and one of the last remaining Sonderkommando saw Saul fia and praised the film.In my opinion Saul fia should have been nominated in all the categories and should have won ALL the Oscars (Best Movie, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Actor in a Leading Role). Saul fia triumphed at the Cannes Festival and got the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year.Saul fia is a MASTERPIECE with capital letters. Something for never forgetting what Germany & Austria did and what they never paid for. The film is in Hungarian, Polish, Yiddish, German, Russian, French, Greek, Slovak & Hebrew, and it depicts brilliantly the chaos of languages (the Tower of Babel) of the Nazi extermination & concentration camps.A must see. Definitely, the best movie of 2015, and, in my opinion, the best movie about the Holocaust ever made.The best: the cinematography (Mátyás Erdély), absolutely pioneer, the breathtaking performance by Géza Röhrig, and the music (László Melis).The worst: nothing."
44,Son of Saul,8,29 December 2017,"A deeply moving, cinematically audacious experience","Son of Saul blew me away in so many respects. This is quite an unusual film in so many ways, from the direction to the unique and successful way it delivers emotions. It tells a simple story, but anyone will realize how powerful it is by simply reading the synopsis.The one thing that first struck me about this film is Géza Röhrig 's performance as Saul. Given that this story unfolds in Auschwitz and all the horrors that are being depicted, emotions are delivered in quite a subtle manner, on one hand picturing the main character as a man carrying heavy emotional baggage, and on the other showing some surprising inner strength, fostered by his newfound quest of morally surviving by burying the body of a dead boy. László Nemes' direction is quite unique, as it consists of pretty close shots of the protagonist with everything surrounding him out of focus, leaving some of the horrors to the imagination at times, and creating a tense, hellish atmosphere in other scenes - always maintaining this emotional intimacy between the audience and Saul. Had Röhrig not been as stellar as he was, this could have been quite heavy - and borderline unwatchable. Honestly, this was quite a gamble - but the audacity paid off.You will not hear any music throughout the entire film. Again, I felt like it added to the subtlety in the delivery of emotions, as it never dictates how the viewer should feel - leaving Saul as the only true vehicle of emotion. Instead, with everything but the protagonist out of focus, the sound (which is very well executed) complements the blurry background and brings it to life in all its chaos, tension and horror. You don't always clearly see what is happening around Saul, but you certainly hear and feel it with him.The ending alone makes it worth watching the entire film. It is brilliant and it brought me to tears - not because it's sad, but because I was brought there emotionally through this entire experience, which culminates with a truly moving and beautiful moment. Very highly recommended."
45,Son of Saul,6,21 November 2017,Disappointing and Annoying,"I won't spend too much time on this review other than to say that, with an IMDb rating of 7.5, I expected a much better movie.I quite understand why the director invested so much time and effort in trying to engage the viewer in the main character's view of the atrocity that must have been life in one of the Germans' extermination camps during WWII. The message was conveyed loud and clear that survival for Saul and those like him was a minute by minute matter. Alive this minute and with a bullet in the brain the next if he even looked at one of the SS Officers or guards.Having said that I understand the reasons for trying to engage the audience by use of very unusual cinematography, I must say that I found the idea of looking at the back of Saul's head for almost the entire length of the movie, with everything else around him being thrown out of focus was, after about ten minutes, not only distracting but also extremely annoying. Of course there's a morbid fascination even these days at what the Nazis did during WWII, and it is true that we've seen similar movies made many times over the years. But rarely has a movie on this subject been so annoying and ultimately unsatisfying.I wanted to like this movie ""Son Of Saul"" but I just couldn't forgive it the infuriating lack of focus on the events that were going on around Saul, rather than on the back of his head and its small and insignificant place in the camp.JMV"
46,Son of Saul,1,17 November 2017,"A nonsense pretentious film, total waste of time.","This is the first time i write a review, but because this movie is so bad, i really believe in the Oscar hype, but oh my...The Plot is total nonsense, no character develop, no proper dialogue, total frenzy shots, i know is a death camp and the camera moves with the flow of the situation, but, the main character is so cold, like an iceberg, i mean they're already death from been there but he just can't let go the corpse of a child, he clings so much for it that it start to be really annoying. I don't recommend anybody to see this movie, is just a pretentious film, time that will not go back in your life, if you wanna see a really good film about concentration camps, go see The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, but not this, i really mean it."
47,Son of Saul,5,1 October 2017,worst Jew movie ever,i usually like Jew movies and i find them touching the holocaust stories out there are great and there is so much emotions in them but this one no sir i don't think so the first half hour is boring that you would probably leave the cinema and choose not to suffer through the rest of the movie but i somehow managed to keep watching and either its a bad ending or good ending it doesn't matter the movie sucks and it does not deserve an Oscar for sure so it is also the worst Oscar winning or nominated movie of the year 2016 and i have seen most of them.
48,Son of Saul,6,28 July 2017,Made me feel weak and lost for hope .,"Never reviewed a film before , don't care about my spelling don't care about the ,s and the .s , just watched the film and felt the need to write something . Rated the film 6 , wanted to give it 7 or 8 for the first 30 minutes of the film , but slowly started to get annoyed. Hate the Jewish propaganda of religious importance . F.ck the religion , not only Jewish but Christian , Muslim and all the rest. Hated the importance of a religious tradition to bury a body of a boy , over the importance to save lives. Don't make a film about the few that chose to obey , the few that chose their life over hundreds of others !!!!!!!!!!! .F.ck this film and its maker . Make a film about the people that were brave enough to give their lives to safe others , others lives not just bodies because of their religious believes !!! . Started writing this with a rate of 6 for this film , finished with a rate of 4 . I understand that this is factual , and probably needs to be said and past on . First review that i find when i google this film is ' an outstanding, excoriating look at evil in Auschwitz ... This astonishing debut film, about a prisoner in the concentration camp employed in the industrial processes of body disposal, is a horror movie of extraordinary focus and courage' , my opinion , detailed look at the ill and bent by religion mind that's at the end of it sanity . Chooses the burial of a body over the lives of fellow living people. Courage ???!?!?!? Wheres the f.c king courage ? , insanity all the way !!! . During WW2 courage meant death !! and the word courage should be reserved for the people that lost their lives saving others or trying to end the tragedy of ww2 and the German invasion. The so called courage of Saul caused more death . People around tried to survive , realising that there is no mother f ucking GOD !!!! and even if there is one , hes a f cking pr.ck , allowing this to happen . He was so courageous , that he didn't risk his life for his sons life but he risked his life and lives of others for his sons body . Film about surrender , the less we get of this sort the better we will be . Thank You"
49,Son of Saul,7,18 July 2017,"a  harrowing exploitation of the Holocaust, to the taste of Academy members","The debut feature film from Hungarian filmmaker László Nemes, SON OF SAUL wins Oscar's BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURE in 2016, it is a hard-nosed Holocaust drama takes a unique focal point of one particular Sonderkommando (Nazi's death camp inmates who are chosen to dispense with gas chamber victims), the Jewish-Hungarian Saul Ausländer (Röhrig, sometimes feels stilted but overall quite an endeavor from a non-professional).From the word go, Nemes' discreet modality of entirely putting Saul at the center stage grandly comes home to the audience, starting from an out of focus shot slowly clings to its object Saul, our visual cynosure, then meticulously follows his steps (a back-of-his-head vantage point) and only shows us what is happening strictly from his prospect, it is an intriguing and contained ploy, on one hand, the film waives a holistic view of the happenings, for fear that the uncompromising atrocity it scrupulously re-enacts is too much for viewers to bear, thus mercifully we are only presented with glimpses through Saul's constant movement, who seems to be strung-out yet benumbed, most of the time, he keeps to himself; on the other hand, the skimpy scenes are no less soul-stirring, the gas chamber, piles of naked cadavers, incinerators, dumping truckloads of ashes, the rampant slaughter, the whole package is there (a sterling job for its production designer, the Hungarian architect László Rajk Jr.), selectively materializes predicated upon Saul's presence, one indubitable merit of Nemes' picture is it has miraculously re-created a reliving the horror experience that possibly errs on the side of being so vicarious that one is instinctively repelled and tries to turn away from it. That is an inextricable dilemma of any film, cinema aims to engross, however, when the subject it depicts is inherently repugnant and horrendous to a fault, as a result we are often mired between these two disparate states, a self-inflicted masochism. Is there any redeeming grace to temper the milieu's inhuman brutality and its overlaying smothering? Yes, there must be, it is Saul's spur-of-the-moment decision to carry out a proper Jewish burial for a boy who dies after barely surviving the gas chamber and whom he claims to fellow inmates is his son (is it true? the answer is deliberately moot, but one inclines to nay, which makes Saul's action more perverse and improbable, maybe he thinks the boy's ephemeral survival is a numinous call for his action), so the imperative mission for him is to find a rabbi to officiate the burial, meantime, chivvied by Abraham (Molnár), another Sonderkommand, he is also embroiled into an impending uprising as their last attempt to scupper their imminent doomsday, but Saul is halfhearted. Granted that Saul's intransigency gravely compromises his contribution to the nobler/righteous cause (to an extent that he will lose those precious smuggled gun powders, and volunteer his own demise just to find a rabbi during the infernal pandemonium), the film perilously threats to negate its own raison d'être, which is to retain an infinitesimal trace of faith and courage to survive under such egregious monstrosities in the manifestation of defiance, Jews are being decimated, but their culture and rituals are deathless. In the end of the day, Saul's effort is futile, the rabbi he rescues is a sham, the body fails to be pushing up the daisies and when the camera finally veers from Saul after his hard-earned smile, what manifests is not a glint of hope but a consolation or a surrender only too soon will be rendered insignificant, ambiguity again takes an upper hand in this harrowing exploitation of the Holocaust, for all its calculated aesthetics, its impact is confounding and its laurels are undue."
50,Son of Saul,5,10 April 2017,No Saul I mean Sell for me here!,"The Oscar-winning Hungarian Holocaust movie ""Son of Saul"" has received a bountiful of critical and award love. I don't wanna sound like a sour grape, but this sour movie did not move me at all; you want more Saul on your entertainment taste, ""Better Call Saul"" instead. In all seriousness, ""Son of Saul"" stars Geza Rohrig as Saul, a 1944 Auschwitz Jewish prisoner who is forced to burn corpses of his own people. Saul is presented with a dilemma when he sees his son is in the group next in line to be incinerated. Saul then goes on a conquest for his son not to be one of them. He takes heavy risks, connives his allies, all the works really for his son not to be put in flames. Director Lazlo Nemes shoots the picture in close proximity with the lead character, which I found it to be very irritating instead of capturing. I was trying to be Finding Nemes in Nemes' chronological work, but it seems this was his first real picture; and it showed. I am sorry to say nothing struck me profoundly in ""Son of Saul""; not the directing, the writing, nor the acting. And yes, I do think it's extremely overrated. But maybe, me who is the Son of Jose (dad's name) just did not see ""Son of Saul"" the way others did. ** Needs Improvement"
51,Son of Saul,5,7 April 2017,Do not fall for the 7.5 IMDb rating,"As the title says, do not fall for the apparently high rating of this movie.I'm sorry to say it but this movie is boring from the beginning to the end, and I'm not talking about art or cinema techniques or whatever, I am just giving my opinion on what the movie meant for me.The story makes no sense at all since the task Saul is performing doesn't correspond to the human nature. Who in a similar situation would prevail the correct disposal of a dead body over his/her own survival? Nobody, that is simple.Another kind of ""annoying"" detail is the visual perspective of the movie, it is uncomfortable to follow the story in that way because almost everything (except the main character) is out of focus.I wouldn't recommend to watch it."
52,Son of Saul,7,1 February 2017,What We Talk About When We Talk About,"I found the filmmaking style a bit grating at times. I love the conversation it starts, about the acceptable ways in which to experience the Shoah through art, but it also does feel like it's done as a way of exploiting the horrors therein. Does this filmmaking style work if it isn't based on the Shoah? I don't know that that's easily answered.It's also clear that the plot is a thin veil through which to take a tour of the horrors of the camp without directly dealing with them. It's ostensibly a fetch quest about an oft overlooked person (in historical accounts that is) in the camps -- the sonderkommando -- trying to bury someone who is or isn't his son. A reckoning with grief, and exploitation."
53,Son of Saul,8,2 January 2017,Son of Saul - a religious symbol of everlasting life,"The movie Son of Saul is a religious movie about a little, 11 year old boy who actually survives the blast of gas inside the gas chambers in the Second World War. He is lifted out of the corpses of naked bodies and is put on a table. A man listens and hears his breathe - in and out - inhale and exhale. This is like the breathe that God breathes into Adam in order to create man. This breathe is very significant and represents all of human life. Saul understands this meaning and wants a religious leader to mark this miracle - of surviving the holocaust ovens and breathing outside the gates of hell. Saul searches for a rabbi. It is unclear in the movie if a rabbi is found, as I do not have enough knowledge of what being a rabbi entails. Saul did find someone who I think could have been a rabbi - but the burial for the small boy who survived the gas chambers was never completed to the end. There was an attempt made but then they had to flee again. I believe that the boy transformed into a German Spy when he was left to drown - half alive in the river. The river must have awoken the boy and he went to where Saul was hiding to witness him one more time. Saul was then delusional and thought the young boy was wearing Nazi clothes and a informer - but this was the holy child not an informant. Saul was hallucinating. In the end Saul gets shot to death - but not without giving up, withdrawing and being internally defeated first."
54,Son of Saul,6,11 December 2016,Important documentary to remind,This movie is for an audience who can digest to watch cruel and horror scenes. Otherwise this is not for you. There is not great emotion but full of moments of pain and cries. It was interesting to see how the camera captured the main characters very fluid. The running time is not too long and just perfect. Saul delivered a respectable performance and I am curious to see him in other future roles. This film works more on a documentary level about the Jewish holocaust in the Nazi concentration camps than a Second World War movie. It should remind all the war crimes in our history of humanity. God bless all the people murdered by the Nazi. 6/10.
55,Son of Saul,9,11 November 2016,If they had actually filmed back then ...,"This movie is very devastating. Of course, when it comes to the Holocaust everything is devastating to watch. But the way this was created, with one character the camera follows around everywhere, this will drain almost everything out of the viewer. The feeling is real, the emotion is as real as it gets and it could not be more in your face if it went up someones nose.Of course that is not necessary, there are far more grueling things (even if not explicit put on the screen, because they happen outside the frame) that will be there for us to witness. Schindlers List was more personal in terms of following someone who was trying to save people. Here you have someone who is just trying to survive. And he has his hands full with that ""task"" as you will be able to see. It may be without color, but that just enhances the viewing and the cruelness depicted. I can't imagine anyone being left untouched by this. Unless you don't like the way it is filmed (you could compare it to the ""Found Footage"" style, but would do this movie a big disservice to put it even near that area)"
56,Son of Saul,1,16 May 2015,Lame propaganda with awful acting,"Worst movie ever seen. Worst acting too. I cannot imagine a movie worse then this. Nothing to see. No acting at all. They (actors) should look for another job. I cant't understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie. BTW It's a propaganda, and this movie is trying to manipulate stupid people.Seriously! this movie is so damn bad you can't miss this! It's like a staple in how bad a movie can go! bad acting, horrible effects for a movie that was not made in the 80s, terrible plot, worst acting ever.At least you will get a few laughs, but be sure not to waste your time watching all the talk scenes...just FORWARD through most of the movie and enjoy the crumbs of nothingness that somehow made me laugh."
57,Son of Saul,10,5 December 2015,Universal human monstrosity never ends!,"This film is probably the darkest film on the Holocaust I ,have aver seen because there is not one single moment of non-suffering, non- torturing, non-cremating, non-exterminating with gas, with bullets, with fire. It wants to show what the Nazi version of Dante's Hell was in this very case for Jews, but it was the same for all social, ethnic or national groups the Nazis or their Ukrainian, Hungarian and other allies decided to exterminate, such as Jews, Gypsies, Russians, Communists, Socialists, homosexuals, social marginals, trade-unionists, etc. The concentration camps were not only for the Jews. Some might have escaped the concentration camps, like trade-unionists for example, but then they were hanged to lamp posts along streets to be the proper example to the proper Germans and keep everyone within the narrow limits of National Socialism.When we have said that we have said everything that counts. In this particular case people were brought there to be exterminated and then incinerated, and they were arriving by the thousands. Those who were doing that dirty work were prisoners that were selected to survive a few months, generally four or five, and they were those who moved the new arrivals, pushed them into the room where they had to undress, then into the shower for disinfection, meaning the disinfection of the world of the vermin these prisoners were for the Nazis. It was not presented like that of course, only disinfection of the bodies before having some hot tea. They had then to sort out the clothes left behind, recuperate the gold and valuables, the papers of all types and of course the clothes and the shoes. Then they had to clean up the shower room, take the bodies to the ovens to be cremated, then bring the coal to the ovens, take the ashes away and dump them in the next door river, etc. On the other side of the crematorium some women were sorting out the suitcases and everything in them and the clothes and shoes in some warehouses. That was an industrial definitely sustainable extermination procedure that was supposed to cost as little as possible and even to bring to the market vast amounts of goods, products and commodities. Even these bodies, alive or dead were used for medical experiments to improve biological knowledge and other scientific or technical know-how. And what the film shows brilliantly is the fact that these working prisoners were organized in a hierarchy of Ober Kapos, Kapos and then prisoners, but also in various ""teams"" or ""brigades"" that had very precisely defined duties and territories. At the same time some flexibility was necessary for things to work smoothly and the Ober Kapos and Kapos were those who could move  ordered or not though always under control  the people that were needed here and there for some special or particular missions or tasks, like repairing a lock or carrying a body to the autopsy room where some of the doctors were prisoners too, or cleaning the tables or quarters of the SS. The film though has one more interest. It shows that some human feelings could survive in such a death factory. Saul dedicates his very last days in this camp to saving a young man he declares is his son by burying him, hence getting him away from the autopsy room, away from cremation and into the ground with the Kaddish sung by a rabbi. All that is futile, useless, pointless, and yet it is essential because it shows in all these prisoners who are just surviving for a short time and are destined to be killed and incinerated sooner than later some human feeling, respect, honor, shine. The film adds in some of them the desire to rebel, to liberate themselves from the camp, from this tyranny. That too is human: resist any tyranny by principle because yielding to it is destroying you utterly, that is to say spiritually.As such this film is a Jewish masterpiece, and yet it is also universal. Never in any historical period humanity has been totally clean of such horror. Any regime, even the most democratic, has produced such horrors: Guantanamo and the Americans, torture in Algeria and Indochina by the French, torture in Vietnam by the Americans, Pol Pot and his Red Khmers, Mao Zedong and his Red Brigades, Stalin and his Gulag, and all the colonial wars of the French, the British, the Spanish, the Portuguese, and some other Dutch people and Germans, Russians and Ukrainians, Turks and so many more. We have to understand this film as being universal and not exclusively, specifically and narrowly Jewish. To reduce it to the Jewish Holocaust under the Nazis would be to fall in the trap of an ideological reduction of the death instinct in man.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
58,Son of Saul,9,23 March 2016,The best Hungarian move for decades!,"In the modern Hungary, people doesn't like Jewish culture too much because of bad media, and the new world order. Banks, giant companies rules on all of us. I'm a big admirer of the Jew culture because of our survival instinct.Son of Saul is the best Hungarian/Jewish directed movie I've ever seen. Special thanks goes to our National Film Foundation and Our new Minister of Film, Andy Vajna (producer of Terminator and Rambo movies Alongside Mario Kassar)Exciting horror/thriller without any blood. 10/9"
59,Son of Saul,10,16 March 2016,"In terms of cinematography, storytelling and emotional impact, this film is a modern masterpiece","It is 23 years since the multi-award winning Schindler's List (1993) appeared, a critically acclaimed film that is indelibly etched into the memories of millions. The emotional defences of today's audiences are more difficult to penetrate because of the range and intensity of demands upon their finite storage and response capacity. But Son of Saul (2015) does more than penetrate our defences. It takes you by the throat and drags you into a world of unspeakable horror, forcing you to stand just inches from Dante's Inferno but with the spectacle out of focus or just out of frame. This cinematic device forces the viewer to fill in the detail whether they want to or not. When it comes to Holocaust atrocities, the unseeable is more terrifying.The story of Saul is painfully simple: he is a Hungarian Jewish prisoner in Auschwitz, one of a group of wardens who herd other prisoners to the chambers then remove their incinerated remains. In return, they receive extra food, a few more weeks of life, and unimaginable shame. Against the out- of-focus images of furnaces and corpses Saul finds a boy who briefly survives gassing and he becomes obsessed with finding a Rabbi to perform a dignified burial for the body he calls son. But Saul never had a son and his quixotic quest is both an act of madness and a tragic morality play. Against a frenzied, claustrophobic background of horrific screams, gunshots, smoke and body parts, whispers of a planned escape by other prisoners serve only to signal that even in this hell human beings retained hope of survival no matter how futile. In no other film have I experienced such raw visceral power of sound and silence, orchestrated with such brutal force to numb the senses and leave you drained.In terms of cinematography, storytelling and emotional impact, this film is a modern masterpiece. But it is hardly entertainment. It leaves you nowhere to hide, shows no mercy, spares no detail. It uses the camera with extraordinary surgical precision, lingering on pained faces, shifting to a wafer-thin depth of field to isolate Saul from hell, then darting frenetically from face to face in search of humanity. Only one smile appears in all of this film and it rapidly vanishes as the delusion of a madman. Why see such a film? Answers will vary of course. For some, it is about respect for filmmaking at the highest level. For others, it is about the imperative of not forgetting humanity's potential for evil. One thing is certain: the shelf life of this film will be measured in decades."
60,Son of Saul,10,2 January 2016,Concentration camp prisoner attempts to arrange Jewish burial for dead boy.,"Laszlo Nemes' Son of Saul is one of the most powerful Holocaust films ever made. He avoids the tendency of cheapening the Holocaust by making it a background for an amenable story, like Life is Beautiful and The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. Instead he presents the Holocaust as the foreground and threads two thin plot lines into it. The film is a very difficult experience because it plunges us into an inferno. Where the German extermination machine is usually depicted as machine-like in its efficiency, here the concentration camp is all noise and fire and chaos. It's late in the Reich's life, the war is ending and the Nazis are trying to kill as many as quickly as possible. They reopen the pits and overtax the gas chambers. Amid the infernal chaos the film presents two quixotic attempts at rebellion. In the collective effort, a group of inmates conspire to try to blow up the camp and escape. They manage a disruption and a handful of Jews run into the forest and find refuge in a barn. But the Nazis track down and destroy them. This is based on an actual event in Auschwitz (unnamed in the film) in 1944. In the personal and fictional revolt, one Sonderkommando, Saul, tries to give a murdered boy a proper Jewish burial. The boy survived a mass gassing. Then Saul watches him killed, then resolves upon the symbolic gesture of a Jewish ceremony amidst the Nazi chaos. He tells some the boy is his son, but he makes no paternal response to him. It's a strictly symbolic gesture, a reaffirmation of Jewish faith and Jewish service to spite the Nazi operation. As a Sonderkommando Saul is in a compromised position. To eke out a few months of extended life he performs the Nazis' horrible assignments, herding Jews to their death and plundering their possessions for the Reich. Gaza Rohrig""s cleft nose is an emblem of the man divided within himself. So his romantic campaign is important for his conscience.His search for a cooperative rabbi proves futile. Some refuse to officiate, whether out of lost faith or to survive. One actually escapes Saul's importuning by running into the lake to drown. Saul hauls him out, but the Nazis shoot the rabbi anyway. When Saul finally finds a collaborator he's not a rabbi after all; he can't say Kaddish. That prayer becomes an emblem of the overturned order of things. Kaddish is the young man's prayer for the dead parent. Here it becomes a compromised Jew's attempt to salve his conscience and serve his God and his faith with a symbolic subversion of the Nazis. In this vision of Hell one man tries to do the right thing  but is thwarted. The attempt is its own reward.If Saul failed with his dead boy, the film ends with another boy saved and liberated. A clearly Aryan lad comes upon our escapees in the barn. In Saul's smile at the boy we read a wider acceptance and feeling of success. But will the Jews kill him to prevent his betraying them? The Nazi troops come, silence the boy, kill the Jews, but let the boy run free into the wilds. Dead or alive, the young are our hope for survival, for honour, for amendment of the horrors we leave behind. By not ratting out the Jews the blond boy strikes a note of hope."
61,Son of Saul,10,30 April 2016,Perfectly realised.,"László Nemes' ""Son of Saul"" follows ""Saul"", who works as a member of the Sonderkommando (prisoners forced to assist the Nazis) at the concentration and extermination camp Auschwitz. He fights for human decency by trying to give a dead Jewish boy a proper Jewish burial and save him from the flames.This film is nothing short of exceptional.The cinematography by Mátyás Erdély is exceptionally well done. Throughout the whole film, the camera stays very close to Saul as we only see and hear what he is capable of seeing and hearing. The vast majority of what we see around Saul as we follow him, is out constantly out of focus. This is not only showing a tasteful amount of restraint, it also makes sense seeing as how Saul himself is trying to avert his eyes from the hell around him.Along with the exceptional cinematography comes haunting sound design. The chaos around Saul is extremely well captured and realised. The screams of people, the gunshots, the sound of fire and metal, it's all very well done. Sound designer Tamás Zányi put five whole months into the sound design and does it ever show.The performances are all perfectly naturalistic, especially from our lead Géza Röhrig who plays Saul. Everything from the expressions to their body language is haunting realistic and makes everything feel very real.This film is nothing short of exceptional. Director László Nemes and everyone else put their hearts and souls into this film and created something truly special. It's very disturbing and sad, but it's also VERY well made by extremely talented people.A must watch.Rating: 10/10"
62,Son of Saul,10,26 April 2016,Absolute Masterpiece,"Very few movies have the ability to simply suck you into the world they create. But none have been able to do it as well as 'Son of Saul'. This has much to do with the films unusual aspect ratio. Shot in 1.37 : 1 the film is very reminiscent of standard definition format. Not only is it a square but the camera never feels our main characters side. Whether it's behind or in front of him, you only see and hear what he does. It gives the film a claustrophobic, uncomfortable feel. Which is probably what the viewer should be feeling considering the subject matter. Saul is a worker in the Auschwitz concentration camp. He and many others are tasked with cleaning up gas chambers, scrubbing blood off floors, and disposing of burnt corpses. After witnessing a child survive one of these gas chambers, living only for minutes after, Saul (Geza Rohrig) decides that he wants to give this child a proper burial. So, he searches for a Rabbi to bless him.It's fairly clear early on that Saul is doing this for redemption. Working in this camp has completely changed him. After seeing and doing nothing about all this injustice he seems to see this as an opportunity to actually do something good. But the film also has the balls to suggest that this may not actually be for the best. It asks you to consider what you would do in this situation. Would you protect the dead or the living people around you? It asks you which sacrifice you would make, and it tore me apart.Considering that this film is Geza Rohrig's first feature, he pulls off one of the best performances of the year. There is so much subtly that he has to portray and he nails it. You feel for him as you would anyone that went through this nightmare. Thanks to him Saul feels like a real person and it makes caring for him and his struggle undeniably visceral. Of course, it helps to have excellent writing to help round out Sauls character.Laszlo Nemes both wrote and directed this film. And just like Rohrig, this is first feature length picture. Holy crap. There are directors that have made countless pictures who haven't made anything close to this good, and this is his first. What he accomplishes in his direction is nothing short of outstanding. The film is comprised of many long takes with a lot going on. If you have seen 'The Revenant', this films cinematography and direction is a lot like that. Except this film doesn't have the luxury of wide takes. Which makes the direction all the more impressive. As the camera follows Saul through this we watch helpless, as everything happens just out of reach.Having nearly everything take place in the background, slightly blurred makes the trapped feeling the movie is going for all the more apparent. Not only that, but it never feels like it's giving a history lesson. It assumes that if you're watching this film then you know what happened during the holocaust. So, it never blatantly tells you what is going on.It leaves it just out of reach, in the background and puts you there instead of tells you to be there. It makes for a harrowing and uncompromisingly brutal watch. It never goes out of its way to tell you anything but instead shows it to you. It puts you in the moment with its complex characters and takes you on a journey with them. The result is one of the best films to release in past few years, and one that you won't forget for a long long time."
63,Son of Saul,9,9 March 2016,"""Son of Saul"" uniquely captures the horror and anxiety of life in the death camps","The opening moments of ""Son of Saul"" let you know what's in store for the next hundred minutes. The first image is completely blurred, and when the main character walks into frame we follow him as he goes about his daily work duties - he's a 'Sonderkommando', one in a group of prisoners in Auschwitz that cleans up the gas chambers, removing the bodies of executed Jews and burning their bodies in the crematorium before the next are sent to their deaths. Even before the titles come up, already we're subjected to the inhumanity of the holocaust, the camera taking a unique first person perspective, hanging closely by Saul in hand-held closeups and being shot with a narrow lens that blurs out the background, only focusing on his blank face, the unique aspect ratio, favouring a more traditional square frame instead of wide screen that helps enclose the viewer into his narrowed point of view. The power of suggestion by showing his face and only hearing the deaths off screen heightens the shock of these scenes to an almost unbearable degree. Géza Röhrig is great as Saul Ausländer, his view of the world is dulled around him, the constant death showing great angst on his face. When he sees a boy barely survive the gas chambers, dying on a doctor's bed, he is filled with purpose again, to give the boy a proper burial by a Rabbi, saving his soul - which he couldn't do with the others. Based on thorough historical research on the camps, including eyewitness diary accounts from 'Sonderkommandos', Jewish doctors and from the buried scrolls of camp victims, director László Nemes and co-screenwriter Clara Royer paint a gritty and truthful depiction of these events, avoiding any exploitation or sentimentality to intrude in its telling. Instead, we see the day to day going-ons of the well oiled machine of death created by the Nazi's, as well as undercover operations by Jews to reach out to the world the world, by smuggling out documents and photos, bribing guards, as well as stealing and concealing weapons. Most other Holocaust films focus more on tales of survival, and showing compassion from an outsider amid actions done by evil men (""Schindler's List"", ""Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", etc.). With ""Son of Saul"", the audience has no one to attach to but a victim in the very centre of their personal hell, leaving the images to speak for themselves without trying to make the audience understand why it happened, but just to show simply how it happened. Personally, I didn't feel manipulated into shedding a tear, but rather just felt disgusted and saddened throughout the movie. ""Son of Saul"" is definitely deserving of all the accolades its been given and is one of the essential films on the subject of the Holocaust.---Read more at DYNAMITE FILMS: http://dynamitefilms.blogspot.com.au/"
64,Son of Saul,8,22 February 2016,"""Son of Saul"" is one of the most creative and personal Holocaust films ever made.","Sometimes life presents us with impossible choices. These are decisions we have to make even though all the options are horrible to contemplate. What do you do in a situation like that? What CAN you do? You choose the option with which you can most easily live, hoping that a better option will soon present itself. It's that kind of situation in which many European Jews found themselves during World War II. Upon arrival at a Nazi concentration camp or extermination camp, some physically fit adult males were separated from the pack and forced to help with the killing of their fellow Jews. The Nazi guards had the task of actually running the gas chambers, while the Jewish ""Sonderkommando"" (German for ""special unit"") gathered the belongings of the Jews who had just been forced into the gas chamber (made to look like showers). Then, when the horrible screaming and pounding on the locked doors stopped, the Sonderkommando had to transport the bodies to the crematorium. The word horrible barely begins to describe the job of the Sonderkommando  or the impossible choice they had to make. That ""choice"", however, was merely one of obedience versus suicide, with disobedience being equivalent to the latter. Some Sonderkommando chose that latter option, but most fulfilled their gruesome responsibilities and hoped that they would somehow survive. That is the world of the Hungarian film ""Son of Saul"" (R, 1:47).Saul Ausländer (Géza Röhrig) is a Hungarian Jew who works as a Sonderkommando at Auschwitz. One day as he is clearing corpses out of the gas chamber, he finds a teenage boy who is still breathing, but coughing and obviously near death. A Nazi doctor plugs the boy's nose and covers his mouth to finish the job the gas had not, as Saul watches from another room. Because the boy's initial survival is such a rare occurrence, rather than sending the boy's body to the crematorium, the doctor orders an autopsy. Saul enlists help from the doctor's assistant, who happens to be one of the prisoners, to set the body aside instead. Saul wants to give the boy a proper Jewish burial. Saul believes that this boy is his son.Saul spends the remaining twenty-four hours covered by the film making sure the boy's body remains hidden and desperately searching among his fellow prisoners for a rabbi to perform the proper funeral rites. Saul takes dangerous chances as he moves around the camp, surrounded by various stages in the murderous routine at Auschwitz, such as receiving new arrivals, operating the gas chamber and crematorium, burning bodies outside when the crematorium becomes overwhelmed and shoveling mounds of ash into a river. Further complicating Saul's quest, his fellow Sonderkommandos are plotting an uprising and they insist that he help, in spite of his conflicting priorities.With every step, ""Son of Saul"" solidifies its place among the world's great Holocaust films. It's powerful like Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece ""Schindler's List"", personal like Claude Lanzmann's 1985 epic ""Shoah"", intimate like 1997's ""Life is Beautiful"" and heartbreaking like 2008's ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"". Co-writer and director László Nemes places his camera almost literally on the back of his lead actor, with nearly every image being a shot of Saul or a scene viewed from Saul's perspective. Nemes also uses a camera lens with a very short focal length, giving his shots a very shallow depth of field, meaning that the main character is often the only image in focus. These cinematography techniques have the effects of blurring the most graphic details of what Saul is seeing and doing, as well as drawing the viewer into the action in a way that feels like voyeurism, but is actually profoundly intimate.""Son of Saul"" effectively shines a light on one of the lesser-known and more horrifying aspects of the Holocaust. Röhrig brings an appropriate understated intensity to the role of Saul, a man being forced to the do the unthinkable. He has become emotionally numb, but struggles to maintain a small shred of his humanity, even as he knows he isn't likely to have much time left. We also see the sober acceptance of fate in the eyes, words and manner of all the supporting players. Those performances, combined with the realistic look of every frame of film and the creatively intimate camera work, wake us feel that we are right there with these people every step of the way as they march toward their nearly certain doom.However, a few problems with the film slightly lessened its overall impact for me. Although it's understandable on an emotional level, it's still difficult to believe Saul would go to such great lengths to bury this boy, not just because he was risking his own life, but also considering he was increasingly endangering the lives of those around him. I also found the anticlimactic and open-ended resolution to the boy's story to be unsatisfying and frustrating (same thing with the movie's ending). As a whole, however, the film's dramatic, original and eye-opening nature helps it rise above those issues.When Sonderkommandos have been portrayed in other films, it has often been through the lens of negative judgment. In the 70+ years since World War II ended, public opinion on this issue has come to see the Sonderkommando as victims, just as much as those who went straight to the gas chambers upon their arrival in the camps. This film presents the Sonderkommandos without judgment and subtly asks the question: What would you do? By telling a little-known story from within the Holocaust and presenting that still virtually unfathomable human rights tragedy in a fresh and unusually personal way, by showing us an unimaginable dilemma, then getting us to identify with it, even with its few flaws, ""Son of Saul"" has become one of the most powerful foreign films of the decade.

65,Son of Saul,9,16 February 2016,One Of The Most Engrossing and Uncompromising Films I Have Ever Seen,"Now I know that this movie was released in 2015, but it did not get a theatrical release until last Friday, so for now i'm calling it a 2016 release, also i'm doing this because I don't feel like redoing my 2015 list since this would be on there somewhere. Anyways, on with the review.There are films that can affect you in many ways and Son Of Saul is one of the most effective and uncompromising films I have ever seen. You feel engrossed by the way every scene is presented, and it feels so real that at one point I felt sick to my stomach from how realistic the movie felt. Every aspect of the film was meticulously presented, and some of the details were incredibly subtle.One thing about the movie that made it work incredibly well was the cinematography. They use a hand held camera for almost all the movie and instead of showing some establishing shots for you to understand where the film takes place, it actually follows the main character through one impressive long take of him brining in the Jewish prisoners to the camp. The rest of the movie, the camera is solely focused on Saul, and most of the background is blurred out so we can faintly see whats going on around, but sometimes you have to infer for yourself. This really sells the idea of this being a journey through the characters perspective, since we never cut to another person, its always following him, we only see what he sees. This also makes some scenes incredibly disturbing since it doesn't show whats happening upfront, you can only think about about what is happening.Another great aspect is the sound design. I know thats a small thing to talk about, but trust me, its also really important. The sound was used so well it actually made you feel like when a character was whispering to Saul that they were whispering into your ear as well, there were so many little touches that made you feel like you were there with him, and again made some scenes even more disturbing. Also the lack of a score is what sells the tone the film is going for.The directing is absolutely perfect. There are scenes that use a great numbers of extras, and these scenes are usually one takes that move around an area, some lasting for 5 minutes or more.In the end Son Of Saul is an essential movie, that shows how a movie can be more than just a movie. I would say its a perfect movie except there was one scene where a scream sound effect was used that I've heard in a few other movies, and it took me out the scene for a bit. I know its kind of a nitpick, but it was really distracting. But besides that, the film is practically flawless, and, in the future, might be called one of the best films ever made.Final Score: 9.5/10"
66,Son of Saul,9,7 February 2016,"Son of Saul is groundbreaking, and a near-masterpiece of looking at horror through cinema","One of Martin Scorsese's great axioms is 'Cinema is a matter of what's in the frame and what's out'. That came to mind while watching the Cannes Grand Prix winner Son of Saul, which is all about perspective and what the filmmaker chooses to put in to a film but most specifically in the foreground in focus and the background out. It's what is called in cinema-speak 'shallow depth of field' (the opposite, a wide depth of field, can be seen in most shots of Citizen Kane for a counter-example), and in the case of Laszlo Nemes' direction it's a relentless experiment that pays off very well - putting his protagonist, a Sonderkommando (or a Jew put in charge of cleaning up... the bodies, the gas chambers, doing menial tasks, anything), into the focus for pretty much the whole time.It's the sort of cinematic experiment that in a way reminded me of Birdman - long takes, keeping things going even when it should in all likelihood cut - but where Inarritu was all about keeping up the pace of a shot to get into the space of theater people, this is all about keeping things completely Harrowing and Horrifying. And even when in this Auschwitz concentration camp we don't see (like at the star) Jews being gassed, the horror is still there because we can see it on Saul's face, what he's holding back from letting out about his desperate situation (in a way it makes it more horrifying for the audience; by showing it it might be easier, by not showing it we may imagine it ourselves, or try not to).What happens with Saul (Geza Rohrig) is that he sees a young boy who has not quite died from the gas, though is put out of his misery minutes later by doctors. He knows this boy, and we soon learn that it's his son... or is it(?) I'll get to this ambiguity in a moment, but firstly the important thing with Saul is his relentless attitude toward the boy's body - first getting it out of the hands of the doctors (who will likely burn it up first chance they get) and then to find a Rabbi to say the Kaddish, the mourner's prayer, over his body before a burial. He won't stop until he can do this, even (unfortunately for some in his group of Sonderkommandos who are plotting an uprising) at the risk of his fellow prisoners.I wondered after the film ended if it would work in the same way if Nemes and his astonishing cinematographer Mátyás Erdély had performed conventional coverage - shot, reverse shot, wide shots, close-ups, etc. To be fair there are a few moments where it moves from a shot looking at Saul or from his point of view and looks to see what he sees, though these moments are packed with significance. But I think that is in large part what makes this experience so unique and one of the must-sees of the past year; it's one thing that this actor Rohrig conveys so much with this character, with his desperation and focus and drive, almost to obsessive degrees of checking every other Jew to see if they are Rabbis; it's one thing that we're seeing all of these monstrous acts (whether it's the bodies being moved around, the ashes being shoveled, the Nazi doctors bullying Saul at a crucial moment). But it all comes down to presentation: how we see this horror is what sets it apart the most, in conjunction with everything else. We know what is in the frame and what is just a little off-center, but we don't forget that it's there, and that is like a constant kick in the gut.I want to say the movie is probably great, but it just misses the mark of being in my top 10 of the year because of something that happens near the end of the story, or in the last act, with motivation (if such a story as this, which unfolds like a nightmare documentary of atrocities and behind-closed-doors hush-conversations). I can see why the filmmakers might want to try to make it unclear if the boy is or isn't his son, or to even make the metaphor that Saul is trying to save ALL of the children, but in the scope of such an incredibly grim, brutal, whatever-word-you-want-to-put-it it doesn't feel quite right. It may for some, and I don't want to take that way from anyone's experience, but just the very end didn't quite work for me on that ambiguous is-it-or-isn't-it level.But as a work of art this is one for the ages, and even more remarkably that a first-time feature director sustained the intensity and point of view for the full 107 minutes and didn't make it feel like it wasn't earned or didn't fit the material. It's a truly unique work, even as I'm not sure I can visit it again very soon for the simple reason that it does its job almost TOO well, akin to United 93 or the Russian film Come & See, also about truly unspeakable acts filmed in such a way that 'you can NOT look away, even though you wish you could.' 9.5/10"
67,Son of Saul,8,25 January 2016,Capturing The Holocaust in the most realistic approach possible,"László Nemes' thrilling depiction of the horrifying nature of The Holocaust in his Oscar- nominated film Son Of Saul results in a unique and original take on the experience of being a Jewish prisoner during the genocide, which captures the true reality of life inside the walls of a Nazi death camp.The film is set in 1944 during the final years of the Second World War and tells the story of Saul Ausländer (Géza Röhrig), a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner in Auschwitz. Saul works as a member of a Sonderkommando group, a unit composed of Jewish prisoners who are forced to aid with the disposal of gas chamber victims. One day while cleaning up after an extermination, Saul is staggered when he comes across the body of a young boy who he believes to be his own son. Saul salvages the body, and the plot revolves around Saul's quest to find a Rabbi among the hundreds of flocking prisoners in an effort to give the boy a proper and respectable burial.The camera follows Saul around the camp almost like a documentary crew throughout most of the film, and relies heavily on close ups that limits much of the view of action around him. The outcome creates a boxed-in effect, with little or no room for breathing in the close quarters of the crammed camp. The overall tone of uneasiness in the film is captured through the anxiety created by the tight spaces of the camera, which further emphasizes the confinement that the walls of the camp create.Nemes' decision to use long takes and few cuts gives the film a documentary feel to it, and as a result allows for the audience to have a more realistic viewing experience. The addition of shaky camera movements and uncomfortable camera angles further strengthens the realism of the film.Sound is another powerful tool that Nemes uses in this film to capture the horrifying experience of life inside the Auschwitz camp. The use of emotional background music isn't exploited in the film, but rather the story depends on the piercing cries of those facing death and suffering to strike the audience aurally. We rarely ever see death occur in the film, but the frightening screams and desperate pleads of those facing the gas chambers is more than enough to paint the horrible image of death in our heads. Again, Nemes aims to capture the terror in its actuality.László Nemes' debut feature film is a Holocaust film like no other. It's an experience that forces audiences to accept the harsh reality of what actually happened inside the walls of the extermination camps. It's edgy and tense, and the stylistic techniques is what makes this film so successful in capturing that reality.This isn't a film blanketed with censorship or unrealistic Hollywood conventions. It is a film that presents the evil and horror that was The Holocaust in the most realistic manner possible."
68,Son of Saul,8,6 December 2015,Following the Saul,"Is there something above staying alive or run away if you are in Auschwitz?This movie was quite a surprise for me when I have a chance to watch it the other day. Big project which reveals the brutal truth about World War II and follows two days of a life of a prisoner from Hungary. When I says follows, I really mean follows the main actor without any shot in entire movie without him. The movie starts with the long blurry shot in which actor shows up in distance and walks to the camera and finally we can see his face clear, he starts to walk around and the camera follows him. Long shot (take), lasts 3-5 minutes. That throw us into the story without any clue whats going on. As the take flows we can understand what is going on, that much how much we are allowed. We don't ,,see the world through his eyes,,. We see him and the space around him. At the end of the first scene we find out what was and what is going on and who ,,he is,,. And we see what will make a ,,problem,, in this movie.Son of Saul or Imaginary Son of Saul?Movie goes on and we are introduced in their plans of breaking away. But, we are not familiar with the fact if it is really his son or his self- delusion. Even when he admits that the boy is his son, we are not convinced. Diegesis of the war? His odd behavior?However, while the other prisoners in his command, obviously his friends in certain ways, try to finish the plan, to smuggle a dynamite and blows whole camp up, he is trying to find a rabbi and bury the boy. His dedication goes that far that he accidentally ruins their plan and make runaway a lot harder. And than when they're out (on the loose) he carries a corpse of a boy and don't try to run or hide, instead, he wants to bury the body immediately.When you watch the film without ,,separating from him,, for the whole movie you have strong identification with main character, and you found yourself asking ,,what will I do in that situation?,,. And there is a question again - is that or is that not his son?If that is his illegitimate son, like he said, chances that he will recognize him, and have that much dedication to just bury him properly, are very low. But anyway, give us a moment to stop and reassess moral code. Assume that the boy is his son and that he, normally, loves him, do you find moral and reasonable his act? There is something above bare life? Is that only a dead body? Is that a question of religion and beliefs? Or question of love?And finally if that wasn't his son we can make a conclusion that situation in which he found himself has impact on his mental health.Both can be true. Director carefully drove us to the end of the movie, without knowledge of what is truth.And, at the end, we finally ,,separate ourselves,, from Saul, few moments before his death, continuing to follow blond boy not knowing if he was hallucination or not."
69,Son of Saul,6,26 December 2016,I didn't feel the pain,"I had to rack my brains on this 6/10 rating - I honestly didn't know where to rank the film. It was good enough not to be bad, if you know what I mean? The camera-work cheapened the entire film for me. Perhaps it was because of lack of financial budget, but filming everything in POV and blurring the background meant that we didn't get treated to a proper feature film and had to mostly use our imaginations for what was going on in the background. Frankly, I found it quite tiresome. It reminded me a little bit of a Lars von Trier film in its sense of hopelessness. bit without the spiky twist.I'm sorry my negative attitude towards this film - it wasn't awful at all, but the 'plot' wasn't interesting enough to hold an entire film. As an onlooker, I could sense right at the beginning that the boy wasn't Saul's real son, through his lack of reaction to the suffocation scene, so I had to work out for myself that Saul was obviously totally desensitised and quite deranged.Again, I have to admit how sorry I am for wanting more entertainment from this film, and not getting it. I feel a huge compassion for all the people involved in the real-life horror of concentration camp Nazi Germany, especially as a father myself and the thought of losing my own family in this way, but this still doesn't make the film an entertaining viewing experience, even for the sick kicks I was looking for.I need something more visual and spectacular I'm afraid, like Schindler's List or The Pianist.And perhaps this film deserves a second or third viewing to fully appreciate its horrors, but do you really want to watch it again?"
70,Son of Saul,10,23 August 2016,"Grim, harrowing depiction of life in the Nazi death camps","The main story here concerns the efforts of one man to give a small child the respect and burial he deserves after a brutal death at the hands of the Nazi regime. Right from the very beginning the focus is on Saul with the background being out of focus and the soundtrack allowing us to imagine that we are Saul and experiencing what he would be experiencing. The latest arrival of prisoners are herded towards the showers by their own and with the promise of food and work to prevent mass panic. The only way to survive for a short time is to do the bidding of the Nazi regime. The outcome is inevitable. The young boy (barely) survives the gas chamber, is mercilessly killed and so the story develops as Saul attempts to find a willing rabbi, attempts to get information of the horror to the outside world and attempts to survive long enough to try and live what life he has left with some purpose. A dark chapter in the history of mankind and although the cruelty and horror of the Nazi death camps is not the main theme of the film, it's the theme that will get to you the most. Superbly acted and filmed, Son of Saul will have an impact on you. Your morals and ethics will be examined when you watch this masterpiece. One of the, if not the most, deserving of films to be recognized and awarded by its peers."
71,Son of Saul,10,15 February 2016,Best WW2 movie of all time,"Come and See, The Pianist and now Son of Saul, the only three movies to depict the true horrors of WW2. The world has yet to recover from the events. Every day one can find something on TV which relates to the holocaust, and at least once a week and articles regarding Auschwitz are to be published. There have been many movies made during the 21st century about WW2, almost too many. So what makes this Hungarian film stand out?It is so shockingly realistic and grim which keeps the viewer disturbed and engaged through its 107-minute running time. We are constantly reminded of the horrific holocaust in our everyday lives, yet Son of Saul opened my eyes for what happened more than ever. The film takes place during a day and a half in Auschwitz, where we follow a prisoner who's work is to burn corpses. However, he finds moral when he wants to bury a body who he takes for his son.Saul is the main perspective in the entire film. About everything around him is out of focus. Director Laszlo Nemes has created something beautiful yet horrific in the long takes of prisoners being brutally executed. These things are never the center of attention, but as Saul runs around the camp we see people getting shot, tortured and executed in horrific ways. Less is more is a common expression and this movie takes perhaps the best use of it.We all know what happened in Auschwitz, we do not need close-ups of dead bodies. However, we need to be reminded of the horrible events and the sound of someone screaming is enough for us to know what is happening. Son of Saul is an incredibly intense film and it almost gave me a heart attack.I have never dedicated so much thoughts to the victims of WW2. Son of Saul is a masterpiece that everybody should see. At a technical level, it achieves so much. The cinematography is amazing, the sound design is perhaps the best I have ever heard and everything is so well made. All the actors do a great job as well and at parts it felt like I was watching a documentary. The production design is just that good on top of all this. However, Son of Saul is so much more than just a film...It's also a movie about humanity, choices we make and how it effects us. If the academy doesn't award Son of Saul the Oscar for best foreign language film then I don't want to live on this planet anymore."
72,Son of Saul,10,6 August 2016,Stunning holocaust film from Hungary,"Stunning masterpiece from Hungary. Holocaust as the subject matter in any film is always heart breaking and extremely difficult to watch, not least Son of Saul. Casting the Nazi death camps for Jews in a new light seen from the eyes of members of Sonderkommando in the most infamous Nazi extermination camp - Auschwitz These were workers recruited amongst the Jews to carry out menial tasks including- death duties like ushering fellow Jews into the gas chambers, hauling corpses to the incinerator and dumping their ashes unceremoniously in the woods or lake. The film focused on one Sonderkommando member, Saul, who must witness the atrocity of his illegitimate son's murder and experience the excruciating agony and sadness of his incapacity to rescue his son while he suffocated under the hands of a German soldier. Resolved not to let his son's body incinerate, the film described his desperation to find a rabbi amongst the hordes of human traffic and then smuggle the body out of the camp to give his son a proper Jewish burial. The film ended with extreme sadness because Saul lost his son's body while crossing the river and he was caught and gunned down by the German search party shortly after. A stark contrast to the ending in Schindler's list where there was a hero and there was a happy ending because some Jewish lives were saved. In Son of Saul, we do have Saul as a different kind of hero who displayed superhuman and desperate resolve to bring peace to his son's soul. Unlike the usual Hollywood formula, there was no heart moving music scores and there was no happy ending. Which should be way because, there are no happy endings to movies about the holocaust. And I love European made films."
73,Son of Saul,9,31 July 2016,Heartbreaking,"I have to admit I have been putting off watching Son of Saul because of it's content. A couple of days ago I finally got around to seeing it and it's stuck with me ever since. It's the story of a Jewish worker ( Saul) at the Auschwitz concentration camp who tries to find a rabbi to give a child , he calls his son , a proper burial. I was expecting this to be so graphic that it was going to be hard to watch but I didn't find it to be so. It's cleverly shot so you are focused just on Saul and hell around him is blurred or in the periphery . I found this heart breaking. Not because of the atrocities that were going on ( although they were terrible) but the fact that all that Saul wanted to do was give this teenage boy a proper burial. He didn't care for his own life . He'd given up believing that he would live. Son of Saul won this years best foreign language film of the year at the Oscars and it does make you wonder why films like this can't win best film in the main category ? Son of Saul is absolutely Brilliant."
74,Son of Saul,8,27 July 2016,"Different, but worth seeing.","There was a considerable amount of press and accolades for this Hungarian film so, naturally, the sucker that I am for foreign language flicks, I had to give it a shot. First, let me get this out of the way - Saul's focus and decision to bury that unknown kid, to me, seemed preposterous. I actually ended up not rooting for him because, well, his decision was horrible. Thrust with the responsibility of bringing back explosive powder to teach these heartless Nazis a lesson and he fails? In that sense, Saul just comes off as a weakling, and a misguided one at that.On a positive note, the movie is hard hitting. Shot in constant close up, the idea was to put the viewer in Saul's shoes. The details given to this presentation was stunning. If I was tasked to writing this movie, it would've taken me ten years and more than a few bottles of vodka to complete. The acting all around was impressive. The movie moved along at a rather nice clip, too; didn't drag like some movies could.Would I have liked to see a point to why Saul was going through all this trouble to bury a kid and not help his fellow inmates defeat the devil that is the National Socialist Party? That would've been nice. In the end, though, I felt a little let down, almost as if I was watching a movie for nothing; well, maybe the kinetic action, but not the bleak story itself. I wonder if Saul knew that they were all doomed anyway, so why bother fighting? Eh, I thought he could've at least picked up a rifle and take down a few of his oppressors. That was the disappointment."
75,Son of Saul,9,22 July 2016,Devastatingly Brilliant and Moving Tale,"This is a film that starts as it means to go on. It is set in the brutal Nazi Concentration/Death Camp of Auschwitz, where Saul is a Sonderkommando. These were prisoners that were forced to become part of the Nazi death machine by aiding them in the murder of their fellow countrymen, Jews and whomever were deemed an enemy of the Third Reich. The film opens with the deception played at the shower rooms where deadly Zyklon B gas was used to kill the prisoners.The film is shot in a narrow aspect and is done  in the main  by focusing on Saul, so that what is happening elsewhere is often only half seen or passes us by in glimpses. This is incredibly powerful as you see how there is just too much to take in and the scenes are both terrible and moving in the extreme. The main plot comes when Saul recognises one of the victims as his son and is determined to give him a proper Jewish burial. What follows is his, and his co-inmates  plight.To say this is a devastating film is an understatement. It is from director László Nemes and is his first feature length film, and what a way to make a start. This is hard to watch in places but it is so well made and acted that its sheer momentum carries you with it. Saul is played by Géza Röhrig who has put in a powerhouse performance. It is mainly in German and Hungarian (but also Yiddish, Russian, Polish, French, Greek and Slovak) and the sub titles are all very good, with a run time of 107 minutes that felt like a mere handful to me  this is a movie you will take a long time to forget  highly recommended."
76,Son of Saul,8,14 July 2016,A Different Perspective on  WW2,"Son of Saul portrays Saul Auslander, a Hungarian man assigned to the ""sonderkommando"" inside a concentration camp, a group of prisoners obliged to do maintenance labors and auxiliate in the torturing task of exterminating their own kin (Cleaning gas chambers facilities, burning bodies, dumping people ashes in rivers), however while doing his usual tasks he notices a boy, a gas chamber survival, being examined and shortly after suffocated by a German officer, initiating the main plot, where he seeks a rabbi to do a proper burial for the kid he now takes for his son.What i most liked in this movies is the way they portrayed the prisoners and the concentration camps, summarizing the genre you usually see WW2 movies focused in the political/military parts or picturing prisoners only as passive individuals whom only option was to wait for the war's end, obviously there are exceptions, nevertheless that is usually what gets to the theaters. ""Saul fia"" shows prisoners unique social engagement given a species of hierarchy inside the camps (Normal prisoners, sonderkommando workers and Oberkapos) and the reunion of different nationalities and languages, also it pictures well the variety of resistance activities performed by them (Writing letters, taking pictures, even weapons smuggling and riots).Géza Rohrig did an excellent job, both expressing the angst and sorrows of Saul, yet also his efforts to survive, as mechanically executing his painful tasks and lowering his head upon officers threats.As many people put in their reviews, it really is a film to make people remember."
77,Son of Saul,10,19 June 2016,An instant classic,"The recipient of both the 2016 Golden Globe and 2016 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film as well as the Grand Jury Prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival, Lazlo Nemes Dogma inspired look at the little known Sonderkommando camps the Nazis operated during World War 2 is a wholly unique experience that is gruelling, gut wrenchingly real and utterly commanding from start to finish.Son of Saul operates by taking the viewers into the heart and soul of hell on earth in the form of the Sonderkommando workforce (a labour camp where prisoners did the Nazi's dirty work) our protagonist Saul (played fantastically by debut actor Géza Röhrig) inhabits, Nemes utilises certain techniques of the Dogma genre to stunning effect as Saul's journey through the various wings of the camp encapsulates a horror that remains an ever constant companion to the determined Saul, even if certain aspects are never expressly shown or expanded upon.Nemes (who delivers a stunning debut behind the camera) and his team have developed Son's narrative to take place around Saul, he almost always remains in our centre of view as the camps day to day activities take place around him, whether it be actions or the chatter of horrors ever present within his world and if happens to be Saul leading unknowing victims into their death chambers, carrying out acts of espionage or most importantly to him, trying to find a Rabbi, Son's always on the move and we're always along for the ride, barely able to catch our breath in between.It's a haunting technique, one that quickly makes us forget we're watching a movie, it's as though we've been transported back to this time and place and while the atrocities of the war have been well documented over time through various forms of media, Son joins the esteemed ranks of films like Schindler's List and The Pianist for showing the uncompromising nature of what took place those many years ago and in Son's particular case an aspect of the war many would feel as though they're experiencing for the very first time.Some may be turned off by Son of Saul's subject matter and its seemingly simple set up of one man's journey to find a Rabbi but Son of Saul is a film that will grip you and not let go from its haunting opening through to its equally high stakes finale. Full credit to Nemes and his crew must be paid as this near faultless drama is easily one of recent time's best productions and an experience you're not likely to forget anytime soon after a viewing.5 pieces of jewellery out of 5"
78,Son of Saul,9,3 June 2016,Criminally overlooked film that packs an insane punch,"This film more than deserved it's win for Best Foreign Film, and I think it was much better than everything nominated for Best Picture. It's a film that uses short focal length and excellent tracking to trap us into the perspective of a Holocaust victim. Lazlo Nemes has proved himself as an expert with the technical aspects of filmmaking through fantastic sound and set design. Through all of these achievements, he gives us a heart-wrenching gut-punch that stayed with me to this day. He truly is one-of-a-kind, as there is no directing style even close to what he has done with Son Of Saul. I will definitely keep my eye out for what he can do next."
79,Son of Saul,9,29 March 2016,A unique vision of the Holocaust,"There was quite a bit of surprise when Cannes spokespeople Thierry Frémaux and Pierre Lescure announced that one of the films competing in the official selection last year was László Nemes' debut feature Son of Saul. But the surprise was even bigger when it screened to an overwhelmingly positive response, eventually landing both the FIPRESCI Prize and the Grand Prize of the Jury, before successfully competing in other festivals and garnering other awards, until its recent nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars. Thing is, maybe the surprise wouldn't have been as big if we'd considered for a little longer who we were dealing with. Nemes lacked experience as a director, at least as far as feature films were concerned, but he'd worked as assistant director to Béla Tarr's The Man from London. And the influence of this renowned Hungarian director, famous for his extended tracking shots and depressingly existential themes, is evident in his disciple's first major work. Indeed, the film takes place in Auschwitz, no less, when near the end of World War II the Nazis were trying to eliminate as many Jews as possible, whether they had to suffocate them, burn them, or simply execute them one after another. Some of the Jews themselves were forced to help them carry out this dehumanized task, giving up their own humanity in an attempt to uselessly prolong their insignificant existence. But one of them, the title's main character Saul (newcomer Géza Röhrig in a deeply committed performance), refuses to abandon all morality, and, amidst all this horror, tries to properly bury a young victim who in his eyes has become his own son, hence offering him his one reason to live. This plot might seem straightforward and even simplistic, but only if you don't look beneath its surface. In fact, Saul goes through a true journey, both physically and psychologically, within the narrow confines of the camp and in little more than a days' time, and everything around him also moves forward towards an absolutely devastating climax. I won't reveal the outcome, but it's important to note that the narrative is structured around a thought-provoking symmetry, one that, also aided by occasional touches of symbolism, helps bring the story to an even higher level of transcendence than what the Holocaust context is already providing. In this sense, one of the great virtues of Nemes and his crew is how they've been able to use a moment in History we already know a lot about, one that's also been filmed on numerous occasions, and yet tell us something new about it, while at the same time paying the utmost respect to those who suffered because of it. And it's the technical aspect of the production that plays a huge part in achieving this goal. Indeed, the technical prowess Nemes and his cameraman put on display here, along with the boom operators and sound designers, make for a tremendously immersive and harrowing experience, portraying the Holocaust probably in the most effective way one could imagine. The long, dynamic tracking shots never feel gratuitous, but are rather demanded by the frenzied actions that take place; whereas the constant whispers, yells and miscellaneous sounds that surround the viewer feel extremely authentic yet also surreal. All in all, Son of Saul combines all the elements that cinema can offer to create a true work of art in the most hostile of conditions, one that should raise intellectual and emotional fervor among its hopefully wide audience."
80,Son of Saul,10,6 June 2016,"It's more than ""The Pianist""","""Son of Saul"" review =including a spoiler= There are many premier movies of World War 2, like ""The Pianist"", ""The Downfall"", and ""Devil's on the Doorstep"", in the same way as other war or terrorism-related movies, like ""No Man's Land"", ""Hotel Rwanda"" and ""United 93"" . ""Son of Saul"" is the most mind-blowing one among the masterpieces I've ever seen before. When I saw this movie at a theater, I was petrified with shock of the tragedy that happened in Auschwitz about 70 years ago. Human beings, I believe, should greatly appreciate the director Nemes Laszlo and the main actor Geza Roehrig, who precisely reproduced the facts that make us want to bury our heads in the sand.In 1944, a large number of Jewish civilians from Hungary were sent to the concentration camp in Auschwitz, Poland. Some of them were unintentionally chosen for the special task force ""Sonderkomando"", whose job was to help the Germans' final solution to Jewish people in Europe; they had to commit fratricidal massacre while the German SS avoided doing this. One day, the protagonist Saul, who was one of the Hungarian Sonderkomandos, found his 'putative' son in the gas chamber after an execution. He made up his mind to bury his son with the authentic Jewish funeral service. Saul tried to find a Rabi among the prisoners in the camp or crowds who were going to be executed. It shows his hope to live even under the fear he may suddenly be killed or executed.However, in my opinion, Saul's characteristics don't seem good. A Rabi whom he had asked to pray for his son was killed by the SS due to their suspicious activity while working. To make matters worse, a woman had given him a stick of dynamite for the upcoming uprising, but he lost it on his way back to the hideout because he spaced out. Although some prisoners got annoyed with his behavior, he seemed sulky and shrugged it off, and said with a sneer, ""I'm just alive"". The director Laszlo and his staff tried to recreate the inside of the concentration camp there described in holocaust-related books and writings, like ""Korczak"" or ""Sonderkomando"". This attempt seems well done. Some survivors from the Treblinka camp commented about what was really done there in detail. Some prisoners left pieces of papers in secret places which detailed how obscene the camp was, so the audience feels like playing a horror video game, like Resident Evil. I guess that would be what Laszlo wants the audience to feel in this movie. These gruesome scenes remind me of the TV news about ISIS or North Korea.At first when I saw this movie, I thought the Hungarian director can only use the old method for a 1 * 1.5 screen aspect ratio, but that was incorrect. He intended to shoot through the first-person perspective, and intentionally hid what Saul doesn't want to see from the screen. Moreover, what differentiates this movie from other ones, is that most of the characters speak their own language in Europe. In general, American movies set in Central Europe are mostly casted to the English-speaking actors, but sometimes spoil the atmosphere by speaking only in English. For example, it's a mystery why a Polish pianist speaks not Polish but English and German in ""The Pianist"". In ""Schindler's List"", the German president Schindler talks to his Jewish staff in English! I didn't know about Hungary very much before I saw this movie, but the effort in Laszlo and Roehrig's work has roused my interest in this country; its language sounds graceful, and its history and culture are full of the vicissitudes."
81,Son of Saul,,1 May 2016,Very well-acted and well-directed,"Definitely a technical masterwork. I had already heard much about its sound work, but its cinematography was also quite impressive. I can't believe that Geza Rohrig got no traction at all. Well, I can, since it's a foreign-language film, but shameful. As for the film as a whole though, I can't say I quite loved it. I did love the beginning and ending of it, and I loved how simple its actual premise was while being something so deeply personal to the protagonist in the grand scheme of everything happening around him. However, I also found that it was just a little too... busy? I felt that it got kind of repetitive in all of the running around and all of the back and forth. Not to dismiss at all what very well was a realistic journey for this character, but as a viewer it made me kind of numb to what was happening. I was emotionally invested up to a point, but then some of that investment was sort of lost. I'd say its minimalist script started off as a huge strength but by the end was perhaps the reason why some of it also came off as showcasing its technical aspects to the detriment of everything else. Still, definitely a good film while being kind of disappointing."
82,Son of Saul,,11 February 2016,See it. You'll never forget it.,"""You've betrayed the living to help the dead."" Some Holocaust movies are invariably held up against a realism template and fall short largely because that ""banality"" is not at all banalit is unimaginably gruesome and impossible to translate onto any screen. Yet, Son of Saul, while heavily dosing its story with the horror, succeeds because the physical terror is kept in the background and the individual suffering in the foreground.Saul (Geza Rohrig), a Hungarian Jew, as a Sonderkommando, bought a few months of life by taking a job stripping the valuables from those who were being gassed and burning the bodies. He travels most of the film looking for a rabbi to say prayers for his son's secret burial. The introductory quote shows what another Jew thinks of Saul's mission.Although we never know if the body is that of his son, the allegorical underpinning is clear: An act of humanity will arise somewhere in this inferno.Director Laszlo Nemes skillfully navigates his camera glued to Saul through Auschwitz, tightly hanging on to the protagonist's face as he searches. In some ways, I was reminded of the traveling ""one take"" camera in Birdman.The uniqueness of this journey is that the major horrors like gassing, burning, and burying are frequently kept in a background blur (no deep focus here) so that the humane hero can be unimpeded in his own final solution. While there are distinct minor characters, the film is wholly owned by Saul, a surrogate for us, who witnesses atrocities but remains undeterred in his quest.Like Night and Fog, the most powerful of documentaries, and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, the most child-like fiction, this film needs not crush us with realism; rather it lets us see and hear death faintly without revolting us or sending us into deep sadness. Not necessary because our imaginations will do the heavy lifting."
83,Son of Saul,9,1 February 2016,A very well-done film about a topic that has been done many times over.,"I, to be honest, after watching the trailer was not expecting to see any new regarding the Holocaust. After the opening shot, I was taken away from the 21st Century and was transformed to the terrible Autumn of 1944 inside a concentration/execution camp. The first impression is how brilliant the cinematography is - in the film we get to experience the horrors from what the main character sees and what is immediately around him. I noticed the background noise and voices of the German soldiers - even though this film is in Hungarian, only some of the dialogue is in my native language. I felt as though watching a Terrence Malick film where one hears limited dialogue from the standpoint of what our central character would hear. The hero of our story is responsible for ushering in new Jewish prisoners from the crowded trains into the showers where they will be gased then removing their naked, lifeless bodies to the ovens. He finds a young boy who survives this horror only to die shortly afterwards. It becomes his mission to have a proper burial and to find a rabbi in the camp. Since those who admitted to being rabbis were often killed immediately, finding one proves to be a momentous task. Through dealing with others in his group who want to preserve the memories of what's going on in the camps through photos and burying letters to obtaining chemicals for a prison revolt, Saul finds somebody to assist, but his time may be running out as for he and many others time working has run out and they too will be killed. Saul must deal with death daily, but it's his goal to preserve his ""sons"" body or at least that's what many in audience are lead to believe. I saw the film with an audience who did not comprehend the nuisances or mission of what's going on. Attention, Spoilers below!!!In his troubled mind, he thinks the found boy is his son, that's why he try to take care of a small funeral with a rabbi. In reality, he has lost his mind in those several months in Auschwitz! Since one of his fellow sufferer tells him multiple times, that he has no son but he does not care or believe in that. Or after so many sufferings, his mind just tries to set normality in something, instead of giving up. The final scene is brilliant - after escaping the camp with the covered body of this child, he starts hallucination about himself (as a child) came to him and smiles to him. The camera now follows his child alter ego running through the forest and we can see as the German soldiers arrives to their mew and hear their weapons shooting. The child disappear, camera stops moving. The end. Brilliant! Rare and very smart experience straight from my former country. Congrats for the first time director László Nemes and lead actor Géza Röhrig!"
84,Son of Saul,8,21 January 2016,Up close,"Greetings again from the darkness. Not wanting to watch another movie related to the Holocaust is understandable. Why should you purposefully agree to experience the misery and unfathomable horror that occurred? The simple answer is that we should never forget one of the darkest and inexcusable periods in human history. Director Laszlo Nemes delivers a new approach  a different viewpoint  and it grabs us and doesn't let go.The startling opening is a long-tracking shot featuring Saul Auslander (played by Geza Rohrig) and his duties as part of the Sonderkommando unit at 1944 Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. The red X on his jacket relegates Saul to corralling the next round of Jews into the gas chamber and then cleaning up for the next group. The reward of this position means the delay of his own inevitable death. It's a closer, more intimate look at a process that we have not prevented ourselves to think much on.What we soon realize is that dialogue is minimal and most of what we see is as if we were standing right beside or just behind Saul. The shallow focus means much in our sight line is blurred, and we are exceptionally dependent on the sound  what we hear often conveys more of the message than what we see. Cinematographer Matyas Erdely never allows our eyes to drift  he shows us only so much, forcing our brain to process and interpret so many more clues.The horrific proceedings may be blurred, but it's a devastating experience nonetheless. Saul's stoic face masks his true emotions and disgust, and prevents him from drawing any unwanted attention. Saul's dependability as a Sonderkommando changes in the blink of an eye  he sees the body of a young boy whom he claims is his own son. He becomes obsessed with finding a Rabbi to allow for a proper burial for the boy. It seems clear that this mission is a chance to break from his soul-crushing duties and grab a bit of redemption before it's too late. Unfortunately, the timing of this mission conflicts with a planned prisoner uprising  adding more complexity to a nearly impossible quest.This is the feature film debut of director Laszlo Nemes, who also co-wrote the story with Clara Royer. Some of the specifics are drawn from ""Voices from Beneath the Ashes"" (edited by Ber Mark) and ""Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account"" by Miklos Nyiszli. It's a fearless vision for Holocaust storytelling with many open-ended issues (we don't always know identities and positions of those we see) and few conclusions provided. But then we all know the ultimate conclusion, and this look may be the most devastatingly intimate look we have ever had.It's not a movie that allows you to kick back on the sofa and simultaneously catch up with Facebook. It demands and deserves attention and patience. Nothing here is designed to allow us a ""hands off"" view from a safe distance. In fact, the lack of traditional story structure and dialogue direction forces us to face the ugliest reality through a different perspective than we've ever considered. Powerful stuff."
85,Son of Saul,7,27 August 2015,Not another Holocaust movie,"Saul Auslander is a Hungarian Jewish prisoner in one of the death camps in 1944. We don't know how he got there or who he really is/was but from his blank face we can conclude that he is crushed from suffering and sees no hope anymore. Cinematography is amazing and actor Géza Röhrig was a perfect choice for this type of shooting. Through Saul's POV we can experience the life and it's horrors in a death camp even though torturing or death scenes are merely visible which was the point I believe because that's not what the director wanted to show as main story. We see that much more of it is happening which requires additional explanation but director forced us not to care.What I saw in this film is a simple human being trying to find his purpose and positive emotions when all hope and sanity is lost. Saul wanted to bury a little boy who survived the gas chamber and was killed then by the doctors, so he said that he was his son. We don't know if he really was his son or he went insane or he just wanted to explain in that way to his group because he felt sympathy for the boy. He goes through a lot of barriers to get his body and find a rabbi for the funeral and doesn't give up in spite of his group, killing, fire etc. Was all that running for one dead body selfish or was the rest of the group selfish for not helping him but only deceiving him? But that's not all to question, there are many more shots which give a microscopic look on the group and it's members in such situations which gives this film a kind of special effect. The spectator really has to get in close to see and hear all of it. I really enjoyed most of it, however, I am not so amazed by the ending..."
86,Son of Saul,8,11 March 2016,A Holocaust Film That Deserves To Be Seen,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Despite its powerful images, the film's threadbare story feels more of a plot device than it need be.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: A concentration camp prisoner goes on a personal quest to find a rabbi among the other prisoners who can give a dead child a proper Jewish funeral.￼JIM'S REVIEW: 2015's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film winner, Hungary's Son of Saul, finally has its nation-wide theatrical distribution release and arrives to our local cinemas nearly four months after debuting in New York and Los Angeles to meet Academy Award deadlines. (I will be including this film in my 2016 film list.)Géza Röhrig plays Saul, an Auschwitz survivor and ""Sonderkommando'' (bearer of secrets), part of a select crew of prisoners whose daily routine includes cleaning the concentration camp's showers and efficiently disposing of the bodies of Jewish victims.￼First-time director László Nemes conveys strong images of the atrocities. He usually shows the violent acts in distant background shots, making these cruel and senseless acts more horrific and focusing on Saul himself and his numbing reaction to the slaughter surrounding him. It is an auspicious debut of a talent to watch.The film is brutal and most effective in its handling of the daily torture and murder that befell the Auschwitz Jewish population. Its matter-of-fact telling and use of sound design and mixing heightens the tension. There is no music score to manipulate our emotions, creating an all too real experience.￼But the film's screenplay, also by its director and Clara Royer, follows a rather thin storyline that, while heart-breaking, fails to make sense. If Saul's sole mission is to give a dead child a proper Jewish funeral, a human and heroic action, his incessant dedication endangers everyone around him, not to mention his ability to illogically travel throughout the camp without notice or objection. This gives our protagonist the appearance of being a foolhardy and dangerous loner, unable to show any degree of emotion or concern about anyone or anything else. This may be the trait the director wants in his character, yet it makes Saul unsympathetic and his motives and actions remain an enigma. Mr. Röhrig is good in his role, although other characters are sketchy and stereotypes of the genre (the angry rebel, the evil Nazi, the brutish bully, etc.), in need of more delineation. Still, Son of Saul skillfully depicts the Holocaust with disturbing reality and reaches a sad and satisfying conclusion that makes this harrowing journey all the more memorable.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
87,Son of Saul,9,21 February 2016,Can a WWII Movie Ever go Wrong?,"Seeing this movie is like watching Elephant by Gus Van Sant (in terms of the visual style), but maybe five times more depressing. A lot of the film is done in long takes where we follow Saul's perspective from behind his head as he navigates his complex journey, interweaving between various work groups in different concentration camps.What is both great and confusing about the movie is that the plot points are touched on very briefly. The way that conversations take place in Son of Saul are naturalistic: since the characters are aware of what they are talking about and planning, things are not overly explained, allowing the audience to fill in the information not given to them. The general ideas of the plot points are easy to follow, but multiple viewings may be required to FULLY register what is happening.The film takes place in a matter of about a day and a half, and while the movie only runs at less than two hours, with all the long takes the movie feels close to running in ""real time."" Because of these elaborate long takes like in The Revenant, released the same year, we have to admire the direction and choreography involved in all of these long takes, especially considering the large amounts of extras used in the film to make it feel authentic.This isn't a traditional narrative as far as cinema goes, but it is a great one. People die without much attention focused on each death: the characters move on, but isn't that closer to authenticity? To reality? It's been done before in films like Saving Private Ryan and Children of Men and it encapsulates the sad reality of death in war: it happens and there is nothing to do about it. This being said, some may not like the protagonist, Saul, for similar reasons, but then again this is not an uplifting movie by any means.One last note: the film has a 4:3 ratio rather than what has become the standard: either 16:9 or 2.35:1, but this does not make the film worse by any means. This is a great foreign film from the 2010's.3.5/4.0"
88,Son of Saul,9,14 January 2016,Intriguing portrait of one of mankinds biggest cruelties.,"What makes this film so fascinating is it's style. The film relies heavily on sounds instead of visuals. It tells it's own story while the camera is almost constantly being glued to it's main character. 99% of the film consists out of close up and medium shots. This combined with the 4:3 video format adds to the claustrophobic feel the cinematography creates. In most of the shots, only the main character is in focus, being almost entirely shot with 40 mm lenses. This adds up to the great style of this film. You feel trapped in the story of the main character and need the sounds to fully understand what's happening. This is a great choice because everyone knows the gruesome details of the holocaust already and it adds to the fact nobody knows what exactly happened, it's different to everyone's perception but the sounds tell you the horrible events.The story is simple but effective. It follows a Hungarian prisoner who has to work as an executioner, cleaning the gas chambers until he finds a boy which he assumes is his son. He wants to do everything to give him a proper burial. It's about finding the tiniest piece of dignity in the most gruesome events. When the credits rolled, it left a remarkable impression. I felt relieved it was over while also being impressed by the film at the same time."
89,Son of Saul,9,25 January 2016,Following Saul in the hellish camp,"Outstandingly visceral, shattering in its content and genuinely raw in its artistic form  there has never been a film regarding the World War II so devastatingly real as Son of Saul. The Hungarian drama takes the viewer to the most abominable place that have ever existed, but still manages to regain hope. Hands down, Son of Saul is a masterpiece.Saul (Géza Röhrig) belongs to Sonderkommando in Auschwitz  he secures prisoners in the gas chamber and removes the corpses. One of the days spent in the camp changes him forever  he witnesses a young boy, who survives the gas chamber. The body of the boy, who is swiftly executed by a Nazi doctor, is then taken care of by Saul, who risks his life to bury him properly, taking the dead as his own son.Holocaust was presented in all kinds of cinematic frame, but the filmmakers usually aimed to provide a wide context of this hellish, hatred-driven machinery of the Nazis. The Pianist by Roman Pola&#324;ski or Schindler's List by Steven Spielberg relied on one protagonist, exhibiting enormous suffering of the individual, but with the dramatic events of the war as the background. László Nemes discarded all the previous approaches towards this absolute annihilation  his camera follows Saul in every step, keeping closely as he wanders around Auschwitz, but never revealing too much of the horrid reality. The Hungarian director never leaves the camp, never mentions what actually happens out of the barbed-wired walls. Auschwitz is a distant planet, detached from the reality. There are piles of dead bodies, blood on the floor, fire and ashes, but most of all  there is Saul and his mission. In all that unspeakable horror, a miracle happens  a boy survives the gas chamber, which revives long-buried emotions in the protagonist.On one hand, Nemes' film is a truly blistering portrayal of pure hatred and sadism. There is no more space for suffering, cries and begging for mercy, which all merge into one haunting cacophony of Auschwitz. There is only the hypnotizing Saul, the viewer's silent guide among the dead or those waiting to die. Géza Röhrig's performance establishes an entirely new approach towards drama acting to me  the actor's eyes say more about his internally dying humanity than any words spoken. Some might find Saul's actions completely unintelligible  just as his Sondercommando companion says: ""you try to save the dead, but you bury the living as well"". Ready to sacrifice his own life, Saul doesn't let till the end  proving that the Nazis took everything from him, but his dignity. And as depressing, as gut-wrenching and moving as Son of Saul is, in the end we all feel admiration of Saul's steadfastness. His courage might not be fully understood, but constitutes a beautiful tribute to humanity in its darkest, saddest moment.The cinematography of Son of Saul is truly masterful too. The film consists of numerous long takes, which reminded me a lot of Come and See by Elen Klimov and a more recent picture, La Peur by Damien Odoul. Due to this excellent camera-work, we feel as if Saul keeps our hand, as we join him in this nightmare and witness the Auschwitz massacre. This documentary approach is strengthened by the lack of any soundtrack too  the sound is only the interior of the crematorium of the camp.Son of Saul is harrowing in every aspect, opening a new chapter in the history of Holocaust on the big screen. Despite all the horror we witness, Nemes casts a ray of hope. Even in the darkest hour of humanity, there was a man, who fought for dignity, in his own, peculiar way. Let Son of Saul be also a monument of the past and a warning  we all should be reminisced of the hell people created for each other."
90,Son of Saul,10,15 October 2017,An extraordinary film,"It made me think of ""Schindler's List""(1993) but this ""Son of Saul""(2015) is different. It's as good as Spielberg's film, maybe even better. Love for your own child, even dead, makes you do unusual things, to defy death that awaits for you anyway, inside or off the concentration camp. A film excellently played, filmed, directed."
91,Son of Saul,,15 September 2017,"Son Of Saul - Unsettling, Difficult and Exhausting WW11 Holocaust Visitation","It's not easy to write a critique for a movie of this type  on one hand, it's a brave attempt to portray the almost unbelievable of horrors that were perpetuated by a regime - claiming to be superior in all the arts - putting themselves above any other race - a race setting themselves up to be the most powerful nation on earth. Perhaps, it was this very pomposity that assured them of an ultimate fall from grace (as with the Romans). This movie however, is approached in such a claustrophobic photographic manner - with a tendency to imitate Kubrick. As with Kubrick's insistence on having overlong stylistic shots, where a camera would endlessly follow behind his subject in an attempt to pad out scenes with limited content. This technique when overused ultimately stretches the interest to snapping point. When will new movie makers stop imitating and form their own style - does everyone have to be the new Kubrick? The same technique eventually killed Kubrick's later works as he lost focus on his stories (that got weaker) to concentrate on their superficial 'style'.Hungarian writer/director Laszlo Nemes, has a penchant for horror and certainly crammed much of this into his nightmarish vision of life as an inmate, working in a Nazi death camp - hideously forced to witness and assist with the repugnant gassing murders of his own people. Maybe it would have been far more effective had he just got on with telling his shocking story in a time frame that held the audience's attention. As is, 'Saul' leaves the viewer exhausted, wanting to fast forward to a resolve and escape the unrelenting photographic style. Much of the story is good but treated in an inhibiting way, making it a questionable award winner - with 1hr 47mins being far too long for the restrictive treatment of its subject. Low budget movie makers use this hand-held camera technique because it's cheap but there's still a lot to be said for some involving conventional sweep!"
92,Son of Saul,8,23 January 2017,Son of Saul,"I set myself a target every year to watch every single film that wins and gets nominated at the Oscars, I had watched the other four nominees in the Foreign Language category, I saved this Hungarian film, the winner, until last. Basically set during the Second World War, Hungarian-Jewish Saul Ausländer (Géza Röhrig) is a prisoner in the Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz, he a member of Sonderkommando, forced under pain of death to aid with the disposal of gas chamber victims. Saul and the other members know that the prisoners they are enclosing in showers are going to their deaths, the members' work consists of disinfecting the gas chamber after use, going through victims' personal possessions to find valuable items, and disposing of the ashes after the bodies have been burned. One of these gassings however sees Saul pulling out the body of a boy he is convinced is his son, the Germans want to perform an autopsy on the body, but Saul manages to steal the body and avoid this happening. Saul wants to give his son's corpse a proper Jewish burial, he is looking for a Jewish rabbi to preside over the burial, he tells other worker prisoners what he is doing in the hope that they will assist him. Saul finds out that many of the worker prisoners are trying to smuggle out information about the atrocities of the camp to show the world, in order to begin an uprising against their captors. The other Sonderkommando members see their task as more important, and there are many moments when Saul may get stalled or caught, including in the indoor and outdoor crowds of other prisoners, but then there comes a point when the usefulness of the working prisoners for the captors may be coming to an end. A riot breaks out, S-S guards are attacked and the rebellion starts, Saul and a group of prisoners are able to escape, he carries the body of his boy, but he is forced to let it go in the current of the river. In the end Saul and the prisoners find a shed in the forest, they rest to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance, Saul notices a young peasant boy outside, they smile at each other, the boy runs away and guards pass him, in the direction of the shed, gunfire echoes through the woods and the boy walks away. Also starring Levente Molnár as Abraham Warszawski, Urs Rechn as Oberkapo Biederman, Jerzy Walczak as Rabbi Frankel, Sándor Zsótér as Dr. Miklos Nyiszli, Marcin Czarnik as Feigenbaum, and twins Gergö and Balázs Farkas as Saul's Son. It has been seventy years since the events of the Holocaust, Life Is Beautiful and The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas are examples of films that have successful made a fictional but realistic story using a concentration camp, this film proves that there is still room for a new film about this subject. It is simply watching the life of a working prisoner of Auschwitz over a two day period, but what makes this film really clever is that we only see what the character sees, the shocking exterminations and hundreds of people confined and suffering seen from the point of view of the lead character is much more powerful, it is intense and harrowing, but a respectful and magnificent wartime drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language. Very good!"
93,Son of Saul,10,3 January 2017,a Sonderkommando looks to right a wrong,"I had heard loosely of Sonderkommandos before watching László Nemes's ""Saul fia"" (""Son of Saul"" in English), but the movie takes an unusual approach to it. This is one of the only movies that I've seen in which almost all the focus is literally on one person, with the background blurred. This serves to emphasize the desperation of the protagonist, a Sonderkommando in 1944 Auschwitz, who wishes to give his son a proper burial. Indeed, we see murdered bodies, as well as the atrocities getting committed by the Nazis, but Saul himself is essentially the window into this horrible setting.It's an outstanding movie in every way. While much of the movie may seem slow, it's like this so that the characters can develop. It grows especially intense during the final fifteen to twenty minutes. But the truth is that the whole movie is excellent. It deserved the awards that it won.Another Hungarian movie dealing with the experience of the Jews during this period is 1983's ""Jób lázadása"" (""The Revolt of Job"" in English), about a Hungarian boy adopted by a Jewish couple."
94,Son of Saul,7,19 August 2016,A very interesting film that I strongly recommend,"Saul, the dead child and his obsession to give him a Jewish bury are the conducting line of fiction in order to show and tell all the true characters and plots regarding the Auschwitz-Birkenau:-Gas chambers -Auschwitz Crematoriums -the Sonderkommandos -the Sonderkommando rebellion (7 October 1944) -the character of Doctor Miklós Nyiszli and his autopsy and operating room under supervision of Josef Mengele -the four Sonderkommando photographs taken and leaked out of Auschwitz to the Polish resistance -the reception of thousands of prisoners from sub-camps to be killed -the massive killings in the open air because Crematoriums were fully bookedmainly based on writings of Nyiszli and Primo Levi even minor facts like the surviving woman after the gas chamber that was killed by pistol fire.Other matters have not been depicted in the film:the very privileged status of Kapos and Sonderkommando members as Nyiszli described in his book is not included in the film (it is difficult to explain the Sonderkommando rebellion if they were so privileged ) A very interesting film that I strongly recommend."
95,Son of Saul,8,15 August 2016,harrowing unrelenting horrors,"It's October 1944 Auschwitz-Birkenau. Saul Ausländer is a Hungarian Jew working as a Sonderkommando member. They clean up the gas chamber, clear the bodies, and collect the prisoners' belongings. One boy manages to survive the gassing. The Nazi doctor suffocates the boy and orders an autopsy. Saul steals the body and tries to recruit a rabbi to give the boy a proper burial.This is a harrowing tale. It is unrelenting and unforgiving. The point of view camera style takes the audience right into the horrors. It gives the audience a front row seat. One could almost smell the sick in the gas chamber. This movie takes hold and never lets go."
96,Son of Saul,,8 August 2016,Good movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Saul fia"" (2015) is a movie you won't forget soon. It's a story of one men struggles to find some inner peace in the eye of the madness and living hell. Shoot with almost documentary style, camera never leaves its perspective of showing things from the point of view of Saul, we witness events as purely as he is. It creates this tension, which sometimes is unbearable, but at the same time i'm not sure i liked this style of cinematography, i would prefer to see some things from side.Overall, ""Saul fia"" reminded me of another terrific and haunting movie about the same place and time - ""The Grey Zone"" (2001). If you liked this one, you should see ""Saul fia"" but be ware that this is not a movie for everyone."
97,Son of Saul,,23 July 2016,Worth watching,"Oscar winner: Best Foreign Language Film of the Year - HungarySaul is a Sonderkommando, a prisoner in a Nazi death camp, working in unloading bodies from the gas chamber.The movie has a unique style. It's shot in 1.37:1 AR, all hand-held following Saul in extreme close-up, his face taking almost half the screen in shallow focus, making everything that happens in the background shown out of focus, almost the entire movie. It gives a claustrophobic feeling and focus on the lead character, almost like a third-person perspective, almost being a part with the actor as things happen in the background, somewhat detached from the horror around him. Some of the scenes are very long continuous takes (such as the first shot of the movie, 3.5 minutes long).Production value is good, making the film seem quite authentic, although hard to grasp everything due to the out of focus shots during the entire movie.The story felt quite shallow and the motivation of the lead character still remains unclear and illogical to me. In the end, the plot felt empty and missing. It felt like a small story, but its importance was showing some of the terrible things that happened in the death camp.In addition, the main character is a Sonderkommando, working with the Kapo and basically collaborating with the Nazis in order to save himself in a somewhat selfish way while watching masses of people being murdered like animals. He's part of the Nazi machine that lies to the victims in order to keep them calm just before killing them. Obviously, it makes it much harder for the viewer to identify and feel empathy for the character.All in all, I expected a lot more from this movie. I expected a more profound story and in that respect I'm disappointed. I also expected to be a lot more moved, but the movie kept you pretty detached from the feelings, in addition to feeling ambiguous for the main character (as I mentioned above). On the other hand, they managed to recreate quite an authentic atmosphere and production value is very good.I felt a bit of influence from COME AND SEE (1985) (especially toward the end of the movie) and based on IMDb's trivia, the director indeed cited that movie as an inspiration."
98,Son of Saul,,16 June 2016,"The God in the Machine - the horrible, horrible machine","I recently read in Slavoj iek's new book ""Against the Double Blackmail"" that there once was a Jewish Holocaust survivor who, seemingly overcoming the trauma of Auschwitz, continued living his life, got a good education, a well- paying job, became a respected part of his community and a good provider for his family. However, when interviewed by a journalist, he bluntly admitted that he hated all Arabs. No reason for it really, he just couldn't stand them - all of them! Shocked by this statement, the journalist told a friend about her curious interviewee: ""How can someone who was subjected to the horrific system of the concentration camps because of his Jewish religion, echo the Nazi's dogma of hating an entire group of people because of their ethnicity?"" To which her friend answered: ""Well, what did you expect! Auschwitz was not a place where people went to learn anything, especially anything about humanity or tolerance.""We have to acknowledge more than that absolutely nothing good came from the Holocaust: it's effect on everyone was only bad. Not that everyone involved, including the victims, broke bad, but that it creates the opposite of what you need to become a better person. And we see in Son of Saul the prisoners of Auschwitz on the verge of hopelessness and zombiedom, and especially in Saul's case, on the verge of madness. But this is not the real Holocaust, this is a movie. Movies are about the human spirit, and just like The Pianist, Schindler's List and La vita è bella, this film shows us the human spirit overcoming the human spirit-destroying machine that was the Holocaust. Notice Saul and the comfort he finds in the (usually) traumatic act of seeing his dead son. (It is not his real son, however, just a dead body he is projecting his hopes onto.) Notice the rabbi attempting suicide immediately after Saul reminding him of a religious verse. How do you hold on to your humanity when that is exactly what will break you, given the circumstances are horrific enough? How broken do you have to be when burying your son is the highlight of your existence? How dangerous is hope in this situation? Saul's fellow prisoner accuses him of caring more about the dead than the living, but when your day- job is cleaning an Auschwitz gas chamber, can you really afford either hope or to care about anyone, even yourself?We see this world through Saul's perspective, who is not able to look directly at the horrors around him, hence the bodies are out of focus, and Saul's back is filling parts of the screen for most of the film. This brilliant and claustrophobic camera technique respects the dead by not using them simply as a gory shock-effect, yet at the same time making the shock even more horrible by forcing the audience to exercise their own imagination, and giving them the nightmare of realizing: ""does light-brown out-of-focus blobs in the back of the elevator are human bodies!"" Escaping Saul's point of view to look at him from the other prisoner's perspective, we realize how damaged he is himself. What do you think about your fellow prisoner who has kidnapped a dead boy, keeps him in his bed, and carries it with him when you escape? By the end, when Saul and his fellow prisoners successfully escape the camp and are on the run, he loses his son when trying to cross a river. Notice that even though he is outside the walls, outside the industrial meat grinder were we have seen him at work, his only thought is still just ""how can I bury my son."" You are not healed by escaping, or even by the idea or hope of escaping, you need to find a new spirit. After his son is lost, the prisoners take a quick rest in an abandoned barn, where Saul finally meets his salvation. A boy stands in the doorway, looking at him. Saul smiles, he has found a living son (this is not his real son either of course)! He cares about the living again, and his arc is finally finished. This boy is a Deux ex Machina, but it works in a film like this. We accept the one good thing that happen throughout the entire movie, even if it is magical, because the Diabolus ex Machina that is Auschwitz is too powerful for a single human being to fight against anyway, especially when a minute later he and his fellow prisoners are found in the barn and murdered.And unlike the Arab-hater in the beginning of this review, Saul's humanity is strong enough to accept all races. The first son is Jewish, and the second son is German. Saul does not care that the boy is the son of his enemies. His hope can go on living in this pure child, whoever he is, because the boy represents a new age for Germany. The boy, who has just witnessed the nightmare of the industrial Holocaust first hand, runs through the trees and back into nature, ready to amend his country."
99,Son of Saul,,24 May 2016,This made me a buddy of Sual !!,"Oscar Winner Hungarian cinema (Best foreign film)  Son of Saul"" I happened to make a wish list of foreign films especially the Oscar short lists. I did see the Indian representations & was curious of knowing who actually won the foreign film category. I came to know about this brilliant film maker (László Nemes) and his work based on holocaust called as Son of Saul. This film is Hungarian and my review is based on sub titles. So what's new on this especially after Schindler's list? Well, that's the whole point you can't be new about history bit you may have a different treatment to the context all together. This is what probably makes Son of Saul a great work. The film is a periodical experience of a Hungarian 'Sonderkommando' ( a prisoner lead in a gas chamber camp who is forced to work as a lead and do job of cleaning dead bodies) & his life in hell for one and half day. The 70mm camera puts a shallow field of vision like a war camera. His daily job in the camp was to gather dead bodies often from his own people dispose them & report back collections of private materials that the prisoners brought. Saul (his name) mainly worked near the gas chambers & waited for people to die inside so that he could go inside and clean. He eventually takes a moral responsibility to be a logical father to a dead teenage boy and provide him a proper Rabbi (Jewish) burial. The whole film focuses on his burial. The treatment of dead body's burial as a central theme especially to show human plight is not new to literature or films. Bengali literature has 'Abhagir Swargo' (Heaven for the unfortunate) and there may be more which i dnt know of. But what made Saul's short cinematic live in hell worth a compliment was the sheer depth of vision that the director offers you. You get to be like a buddy for Saul & think why is he doing this? Well we will never know why Saul actually thought a dead body as his own son. You are rational in a rational world. You walk when you have a ground. Saul had none for him so we can't judge a fair mind from him. What I also loved about this cinema is that music is almost muted. You have to hear the background score with great concentration. I simply loved this as a muted music may refer a past grace or a distant memory. Maybe Saul's head was banging with his past or maybe the lost echo of his happy days. Watch this film but in case you have limited view of world war and holocaust  then consider doing some internet research before watching this film. This film is not suitable to be watched with kids (naked dead bodies) so consider that as well. What happens to Saul or the plot is not relevant for my review  what still hold true is what we have learnt from the holocaust ?"
100,Son of Saul,,18 May 2016,A stunning piece of work,"By the time I viewed this Hungarian production, it had won the 2016 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It is a stunning piece of work. It is not just the dramatic subject matter: the slaughter of Jews at Auschwitz (which I have visited). It is the distinctiveness of the viewpoint - that of a Sonderkommando, one of the Jews forced to aid with the disposal of gas chamber victims - and the novelty of the narrow aspect and shallow focus filming with the camera always on his face or over his shoulder so that the horrors are so close and yet quite indistinct. Depicting just two days of this hell on earth, the story-line endeavours to find some humanity in this madness through one man's wish to arrange a proper burial for a dead boy for whom he feels a strange parental bond. Remarkably this is the debut work of both director László Nemes and actor Géza Rohrig."
101,Son of Saul,9,17 May 2016,Brings Home the Waking Nightmare That Was Life in a Concentration Camp,"The sheer and utter depression of the Holocaust was not fully brought home to me until I read William Styron's ""Sophie's Choice."" Up to then, I had recognized the horror of it, the disbelief that humanity could sink to such depraved levels, the anger and sorrow inspired by stories of the victims. But more than anything while reading Styron's book, I was struck by how demoralizing the Holocaust was. It just may be the most singularly depressing event in human history, and what brought it home in that particular book is that Styron elaborated on the mechanization of it. These mass murders weren't being carried out in moments of anger, they weren't personal, they weren't the sick fantasy of one insane person's fevered brain. They were industrialized to the point that the humans being cycled through the camps were no different than cattle, and the people working the camps didn't think of them as anything different.""Son of Saul"" is the first film about the Holocaust I've seen that captures that same sense of hopeless depression I found in Styron's book. The camera sticks close to the film's protagonist, Saul, as he wanders through the waking nightmare that is life inside the prison camps, numb to the human carnage that takes place around him as he persists in his singular obsession with finding a rabbi to bless the dead young boy he has convinced himself is his son and give him a proper burial. The futility of Saul's task asks the audience to consider: Is it a noble gesture of humanity to be respected, one small attempt to retain a grip on humanity in the absence of anything resembling it; or is it a selfish, self-centered obsession with the impractical when Saul could have been providing real assistance to the living who needed it? The film doesn't make judgements, and I certainly found as a viewer that I couldn't either. How on earth could anyone who hasn't himself lived through the same thing even begin to think he would know how he would act in a similar situation? Unlike the most high profile and famous films about the Holocaust (""Schindler's List,"" ""The Pianist""), ""Son of Saul"" doesn't even attempt to find a strain of hope or redemption in this story. It acknowledges what other artists who have tackled the Holocaust can't seem to bring themselves to admit, which is that there isn't even the slightest fragment of a happy ending to be found in an unspeakable moment of human history. I know why other artists can't acknowledge this -- it makes the senseless pain and human waste even that much more unbearable to contemplate. But it feels much more honest than those other films.This is a tough but excellent movie.Grade: A"
102,Son of Saul,9,4 May 2016,Masterpece ( Indian Reviews),"This is a movie about humanity amidst cruelty, a movie that speaks about human compassionate culture still surviving in the house of evil and barbarism. Son of Saul is a movie that takes you straight into the extermination camps of Nazi Germany where a Jew makes a desperate attempt to bury a young boy with proper Jewish rituals. The task was next to impossible as we has looking for kindness in a house that was host to cruelty and destruction of humanity. The beauty of this movie is that it is quiet and silent and yet filled with screams. Director László Nemes has not only captured the horrors of these gas chambers but he actually made the viewers feel the screams and horror. The scenes of holocaust were not directly shown but were kept out of focus in the background which actually was more effective for me. If we imagine ourselves present in that place we would avoid looking the killings directly and they will just remain as glances at the corner of our eye creating an out of focus smoky image in our memory. The Director captures this perfectly and the killings may not give your eyes a brutal shock but it leaves a deep impact after every scene. The sound captured in the movie was also brilliant as the dialogs were as loud as the background noises giving the viewer a more accurate picture of the place. At times you will feel you are just present with Saul peeking over his shoulders.The movie is not about heroism, victory or a war story. Because such incidents like holocaust do not fit in those category. It is a movie about humanity trying to breath its last in the kingdom of Devil.It is a story about how invisible relations are born in the strangest of manner possible at a place where every relations are destroyed and burned in fire.This movie shows that a good story teller can create masterpiece even on a newspaper. One does not need high budget and CGI to tell a story that etches in your memory very deep. The acting of every actor was excellent and even with a very limited dialogue they successfully displayed every single emotions of that scene. It is a movie worth watching alone. I am sure it will hit you deep inside. I am so sure..."
103,Son of Saul,7,4 May 2016,"Experiencing what Saul's seeing, hearing and undertaking.","The World War II is the largest source supplier for the war movies. I have seen numerous breathtaking braverism, as well as heartbreakingly suffering film characters which are based on the real and sometimes fiction. The genre too differs, from action, adventure, war to the comedy, romance, drama et cetera. Since the Academy Awards nominee announcement in the January I had an eye on this, but now it had won the Oscars that draw my interest even more on this. Anyway, finally saw this, so let me tell you what I feel about it.It is no ones biopic, but inspired by a collection of testimonies of those who had made out alive from the Auschwitz. Like some of the WWII films, it is very unique, that focused on a particular event and a person. Saul is one of the prisoners in the Nazi held concentration camp who is a slave-labour. His job is to clean the place after prisoners were executed. One day he finds a young boy who was executed and soon he takes the responsibility to give him a proper burial. Risking his own life and others, he begins to find a rabbi to perform the last rites. So what happens later and how it ends is the remaining film.It is not only enthralling story, but was very clever and unique filmmaking. In this whole film you will see one face at all the time in different angles and mostly they're close shots. Yes, Saul is everywhere, the camera never takes off its lens out of him. We would experience what he sees, listening and undertaking, more like in the real time. Just like a computer game where everything is from our (player's) angle, but here it is us again barely through the Saul's perspective. (Something like the upcoming Hollywood film 'Hardcore Henry' trailer I saw.)Although, the movies are not the games, like I felt weird during watching 'Need for Speed', when Aaron Paul was at my place. And a movie always needs a character that can take us to the journey through the time and space where it sets, otherwise it will be called a documentary film. The aspect ratio was like the older day films which is narrow that takes time for us to get used to it, yet it is a colour film. More like the entire story is taking place within the 48 hours. Interesting pace and developments, and a decent conclusion. I think it deserved all the praise and prizes given to it.""You have forsaken the living for the dead.""I know the seriousness of the film and its contents, but I could not avoid the laugh at the end scene. I did not want to, but I did it without my self-awareness after seeing the Saul's face. I hope, there are others too, like me in that situation. Yet the storyline was very strong, like how far would a man can go knowing the life is meaningless after what he's going through. That makes him to take a solo mission when others are struggling and working together for their freedom.Since I don't know any language that spoken in the movie, I had no problem too to follow the movie. The 1944 settings were so realistic, I think everyone's hard-work was this film's result. All the performances were excellent, especially who played the Saul's role. That is the face no one is going to forget who had watched this film. However the real hero of the film was not the actors or the writers and the director, but the cameraman. Like I said earlier, he had done a brilliant job. If anyone wants to praise this film, he/she must begin with him. The cinematography award at the Oscars might have went to 'The Revenant', but the cameraman award is none other than this guy who shot this film.I really liked this film, but not overly sympathised or enjoyed. Usually if any movie that's based on the real gets my favour, even the movie has been low quality with more than ignorable flaws. Because telling the truth to the world is what I consider is foremost important than trying to get benefit out of it. But when it's not factual, I expect whatever the cinematical options can make it a better product.This film comes between them both, but leans mostly on the truth about the World War II prison camp. An insight of what the prisoners have went through. Painful to watch a movie like this, at a time I appreciate the filmmakers for giving this film and let the younger generation know a tiny dot of the incident of the WWII. To watch this film, no one needs a reason. It is automatically a must see, but after watching it, whether you liked it or not is an individual opinion.7/10"
104,Son of Saul,,20 April 2016,Horrifying all the same,"Maybe I am wrong but I think I have read somewhere that Holocaust survivors who still exist, say that of all the films made about the Holocaust till now this is the one that better and more authentically reproduces the real atmosphere of a nazi extermination camp. In fact to begin with, the shooting technique puts us the viewers inside the camp among its inmates because it uses almost all the time the close up image mainly focused on the protagonist's face while he walks and wanders among the prisoners and meanwhile we hear the noises off made by the terrified people penned up in the gas chamber, their desperate cries and loud weeping, the bangs and clangs on the chamber doors and the yelling orders of the German officers who utter the cry of ""schneller"" (faster) all the time. The protagonist is a Sonderkommando (an inmate who is treated less ruthlessly because he is employed by the Germans in collaborating with then in the task of herding the other prisoners although a few months later Sonderkommandos could be killed themselves). His main purpose is trying to give a proper Jewish religious funeral to a young boy that survived to the gas inhalation to be afterwards smothered to death by a German officer. For that he hides the corpse and tries to find a rabbi to perform the funeral in a secret way of course. All the time we can feel the brutal and intensely dramatic atmosphere of the camp. Despite not showing much the usual particularly awful images of other Holocaust movies, it is horrifying all the same."
105,Son of Saul,9,13 April 2016,One of the best from Holocaust movies,"This movie though set in the backdrop of WWII at the Auschwitz concentration camp, is just not a war movie. It highlights the human emotions, in the backdrop of extreme adversity. Right from the first frame, you have Saul Auslander's (Géza Röhrig) face which takes you along the movie. There's so much going on with him, that the rebellious uprising around in the camp makes no difference to him. Humiliation, guilt, dealing with death everyday & also being an unwilling participant in these deaths has been empathetically portrayed. The movie doesn't have a dull moment even once with the last scene being just way too perfect for me!"
106,Son of Saul,8,8 April 2016,Defies expectations in a very good way,"This film is very special for the Hungarian audience, and for a good reason. Not very recently we had a liberal government with palpable Israeli influence on local politics. (Most notably, Israeli soldiers dressed as Hungarian cops and firing rubber bullets at peaceful people on the streets on 23 October 2006, on the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution.) This government and their Israeli friends did everything to push the Holocaust down the throat of Hungarians and force them to admit their responsibility for it. Hungarians didn't take it well. All they achieved was to convince an entire generation that the Holocaust is a propaganda tool in Israeli politics and the leftist agenda. This movie was not received with too much awe in Hungary. It is viewed as another propaganda piece about a falsely represented historic event. I can't remember any of my friends ever watching it, but I also can't name anyone who hasn't despised it without seeing.They are wrong. This movie is good. Even if it's just a work of fantasy. It is largely based on the memoirs of Miklós Nyiszli, a Jewish doctor who claimed to have worked for Dr. Joseph Mengele in Auschwitz. His account was the first ever published about the death camp in the 1940s-- and the first to be debunked by historians. Nowadays it's widely accepted to be plain forgery. Nevertheless Holocaust propagandists keep reprinting his story as ""authentic"".But this won't make it a bad movie. We all love Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad and many more which we also know are not true. Still we feel for its characters and genuinely feel for them. There are many WW2 movies which take place in a historic environment, in battles fought in reality but with fictional characters. Why hate a work of fantasy which takes place in a fictional death camp?And for that, it's brilliantly made. It truly deserved an Oscar. The novel and unique approach to the protagonist's perspective is unlike I've ever seen. It plays brilliantly with light, sound and emotions. We know it didn't happen this way. Saul Auslander did not exist, his story is not more true than Bambi. Still, death camps did exist. Not this, and not this way, but something very similar did. What if Saul was a German POW in a Siberian death camp? Or if he was a Chinese in a Japanese camp? Or a prisoner today in North Korea's camps?Definitely not a piece of propaganda. A nicely made movie about humanity. Or well, not so ""nicely"" - the entire movie is deliberately bleak and unpleasant. I loved it."
107,Son of Saul,,6 April 2016,"Absolutely Worthy Of All Its Accolades, Son of Saul Is Essential Viewing.","The latest recipient of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Son of Saul (also known as Saul fia) is an exceptionally powerful, relentlessly grim & downright disturbing cinema that takes a leaflet out of mankind's darkest phase and weaves an original, absorbing & deeply affecting story around it, all depicted in a manner that only magnifies the haunting horrors of the Holocaust.The story of Son of Saul takes place inside the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II and covers a day or two in the life of a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner who, along with a selected few, is tasked with the disposal of the corpses of gas chamber victims. The plot follows his dangerous & desperate attempt to provide a proper Jewish burial to the body of a young boy he takes for his son.Co-written & directed by László Nemes, Son of Saul marks his feature film debut and it is by every means a sensational start to his directional career. The film is disquieting from the very first scene that takes us through Saul's daily duty in the camp and it is through his eyes that we get a glimpse of genocide in fully-operational mode. And all of it is shown from such an extreme close-up that it is bound to discomfort many.The deftly written screenplay is worthy of mention as well for it keeps a stringent focus on what's going on with the protagonist amidst all the horror, chaos & despair and never for once leaves his side. The decision to illustrate the brutal life of Sonderkommando is commendable too for they've been a subject of controversy throughout history as many consider them to be collaborators who assisted the Nazi in exterminating their own race.Son of Saul shows that Sonderkommando were no less victims than other prisoners in the camp for they had no control of their destinies, were inducted into the unit regardless of their choice & were forced to act under the threat of death. Their slightly improved living conditions compared to other prisoners only existed because they were needed by Germans to keep their death factories running and while it was a cruel situation for them to be in, it did help them survive longer than the others.Cinematography is a definite highlight for the camera stays alongside Saul throughout his ordeal & serves as his companion at all times. It also employs shallow focus to blur the genocidal massacre taking place in the background and the unusual aspect ratio it opts for further helps in realising its narrow field of vision. Many segments are shot in single, unbroken takes plus the very atmosphere of despair & gruesome horror is effectively maintained over the course of its 107 minutes runtime.Sound design is another impressive element that, through the expertly assembled screams, cries & pleadings, gives the viewers a perception of what's happening around Saul at any given time, thus allowing them to imagine the horrible imagery on their own. And just like the stellar camera-work, it stays within the main character's field of vision & hearing. Editing is brilliantly carried out for there isn't even one inessential sequence present in the final print and all events unfold at a steady pace.Coming to the performances, Géza Röhrig carries the entire picture on his shoulders and delivers a very strong, finely layered & emotionally resonant rendition of his character. For the most part, it's a silent showcase from Röhrig as the camera relies only on his body language to express what he's going through and he truly nails that part. Rest of the supporting cast also chip in with outstanding inputs but the film's real payoff is in witnessing a man's efforts to carry out a humane deed amidst reckless evil.On an overall scale, Son of Saul is a profoundly upsetting, absolutely devastating & emotionally scarring cinema that captures the implementation of Nazi's ""Final Solution to the Jewish Question"" from an unsettling close-range, provides an authentic sense of what it's like to be in a living hell, and works as both a thrilling drama & an informative historical piece that retains all the harrowing reality of the Holocaust without abandoning its own story. Absolutely worthy of all its accolades, inarguably the best film of 2015, and a must-watch for all, this Hungarian masterpiece is essential viewing in every sense of the word & comes very highly recommended."
108,Son of Saul,8,11 March 2016,World War II flicks are always good Oscar bait; at least this one offers something fresh!,"'SON OF SAUL': Four Stars (Out of Five)This year's Oscar winning Best Foreign Language film, is this World War II drama flick. It's about a concentration camp prisoner, who's forced to burn the bodies of his own people, that goes on an obsessive mission to give a deceased boy a proper burial. The movie was directed by first time feature filmmaker Laszlo Nemes; and it was written by Nemes and Clara Royer. The film stars Geza Rohrig; a New York City-based Hungarian poet (that hadn't acted since the 1980s!). It's received mostly rave reviews from critics, and I mostly agree with them.The story takes place in a 1944 Auschwitz concentration camp. Saul Auslander (Rohrig) is a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner there, that's forced to help cremate fellow Jews. One day he notices that a young boy is still breathing; after being gassed in a Nazi gas chamber. The boy is killed, by a prison doctor, and an autopsy is ordered. Saul makes it his mission to rescue the corpse; and give it a proper burial. He spends the next day-and-a-half trying to locate a rabbi to help him. The movie is oddly filmed in the 'found footage' format; which isn't possible (given the time period it's set in) but it's still an interesting directing tool. It makes the film seem more claustrophobic, but it also makes it seem much slower-paced (which can be very frustrating at times). Overall I found the movie to be very creative, interesting and horrific; and (like other films of it's type) it seems just as much like a horror movie as a drama. World War II flicks are always good Oscar bait; at least this one offers something fresh, and original, as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/EuKmXpjFt-k"
109,Son of Saul,7,25 February 2016,"Son of Saul, or the strength of the faith","When the movie began, I thought that was another more movie about the ""Holocaust"" and expected couldn't be better than ""Schindler's List"", but the ""Holocaust"" is only the background curtain, the leitmotiv is the faith and perseverance for to do what is believe should be done, another title for the movie could be ""The strength of faith"". Despite of ""Holocaust"" how background curtain, again I felt the stunning coldness of Germans for despise and kill massively human beings. Sometimes I feel ashamed to belong to the human race, with reason said Emil Cioran: ""We must conform, lousy and serene, with the company of beast, stagnate at their beside for a some millennium more""."
110,Son of Saul,8,22 February 2016,Worthy of its Golden Globe win for Best Foreign Language Film,"Such a moving film worthy of its Golden Globe win for Best Foreign Language Film. ""Son of Saul"" was incredibly captivating even with the language barrier. Usually I don't love films with subtitles because it can distract from the performances, but the cast was so incredible, the subtitles didn't take away any aspect of the film. Géza Röhrig did an wonderful job as the lead character Saul. Set in a concentration camp, ""Son of Saul"" brought to light important events that happened in our world's history. Director László Nemes took such a terrible, sad subject and made the film intriguing to its audience. I'm excited to see if this film will take yet another award at the Academy Awards."
111,Son of Saul,7,19 February 2016,"I think there's a hymn that goes, ""Time, like an ever-rolling stream . . . """,""" . . . bears all its sons away."" That's what happens in SON OF SAUL, a subtitled allegory. The movie makers seem to be saying something along the lines of, ""Let go of the past, and let the Dead bury the Dead."" Just as Cruz and Bush must drop out to let Rubio thump Trump, the SON OF SAUL people are arguing that the Israelites should throw their lot in with the Crusaders to win a Final Victory in the Middle East. That's why they have written a script in which ALL the flag bearers for the Star of David perish, including half a dozen rabbis. Though Saul is shown digging graves for his son here, there, and everywhere, this movie prognosticates that in the end it's just a matter of ""ashes to ashes, dust to dust."" There's a Chinese Proverb that counsels, ""If you can't lick them, join them."" Which is what hundreds of Nazi detainees have done here in agreeing to be ""Sondercommandos."" Instead of forcing the Nazis to do their own lying and dirty work, these ""cleaners"" self-police to desecrate their own dead so efficiently that Hitler's minions can slay twice as many of their People in half the time. SON OF SAUL exposes this as an Ultimate Failure, the consequences of which still need redressing today."
