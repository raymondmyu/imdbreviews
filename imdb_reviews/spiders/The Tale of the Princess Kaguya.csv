0,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,5 December 2013,Very good reputation in Japan,"I've already watched this film 3 times! I was deeply moved and couldn't stop crying every time.I believe that ""Princess Kaguya"" is the best Ghibli film in the past 10 years because of the beautiful hand-drawn animation and touching story.Japanese audience and critics are also very positive for this film, compared to other Ghilbi films.Hayao Miyazaki is a genius but his recent films are always controversial since ""Haul's Moving Castle"".One of the reason is that he relies on his imagination and makes light of a script. That's why quite a few people can't fully understand his recent films and sometimes blame them. (""The Wind Rises"" was a tragedy in this meaning.)Isao Takahata, the director of ""Princess Kaguya"", is a very good director known for ""The Grave of Firefly"" but not so active since ""My neighbor the Yamada"". His philosophy is very different from that of Hayao Miyazaki. Isao Takahata thinks the scenario is very important and he prefers realism to fantasy. ""Princess Kaguya"" is based on the Japanese oldest folklore ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter"". But Isao Takahata transforms it into a universal humanistic story by describing Princess Kaguya as a realistic girl.This film contains many fantastic scenes and they play as good eye candies. But the brilliantly illustrated life and emotions of the heroine is the most important part in this film. And that's what the director wants us to try to sympathize.The beautiful and artistic style of this animation is suitable for this theme. Because this apparently unfinished animation gives us the room to imagine by ourselves.Isao Takahata says, ""The animations tend to deprive children of their own imagination by pushing them someone else's fantasy. We have to make another animation which let them imagine by themselves"".I can't wait to see the responses from the worldwide audience! Hope you will like this film too!"
1,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,29 September 2014,A Triumph,"With the exception of the energetic The Lego Movie, this year has been a disappointment for the animated genre. What a relief then it is that Isao Takahata's (Grave of the Fireflies) new film is a triumphant success. Based on a 10th century Japanese folktale, The Tale of Princess Kaguya is a bittersweet coming of age story. Our protagonist is Kaguya-hime who is discovered as a baby in a bamboo stalk by an old peasant man. He and his childless wife raise her as their own, providing the best they can as she rapidly ages. While her mother is fearful of change and just wants a comfortable life for her adopted daughter, her father envisions great things. He sees Kaguya as part of a divine plan and after fine clothes and gold come shooting out of bamboo stalks he concludes that the heavens want her to become a proper princess. He assumes this is the best way to make his daughter happy instead of asking her what she wants. A sharply observed feminist critique of traditional Japanese culture as well as a cautionary tale of the burdens we place on our children, The Tale of Princess Kaguya has a wealth of complex themes and archetypes hidden beneath the surface of its fairly straight- forward story. This is one of the rare films that are both easily accessible to a young audience and one that film students can write thesis papers on. The final word should be reserved for Studio Ghibli's animation. The style used invokes something between impressionist paintings and water-colours while employing a muted palette. Ghibli moves away from traditional anime and the results are breathtaking. The hand drawn frames could each stand alone as a portrait and yet the film feels fluid. At times the animation blurs into expressionism; the brush strokes matching the characters inner- turmoil. Easily the best animated film of the year, it's a must see for fans of the genre. Luckily North America will get a theatrical release; the English-dubbed version will be out October 17 and will star Chloe Grace Moretz as Kaguya."
2,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,7 December 2013,A beautiful version of the old Japanese folk tale. A must see!,"Like many other Ghibli fans I didn't like the Yamadas back in the day but Takahata Isao has returned with a blast.The film is beautiful. The animation is simple yet exquisite, reminiscent of old Japanese watercolours. Special kudos go to Joe Hisaishi for his superb soundtrack - the final scene and its music left me almost in tears.The only problems lie in the sometimes slow development of the plot and a few loose ends. There are also tiny deviations from the original story, but I felt that it was as true to it as possible. All in all a beautifully drawn, beautifully crafted movie, solid voice acting (for a Japanese movie at least) and, again, the beautiful music. Excellent job, Ghibli. Hats down to Mr. Takahata as well."
3,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,13 November 2014,Incredible Art-Style and Profound Story,"The Tale of Princess Kaguya was certainly a story that I was fully intrigued with. Because of its limited release in theaters, it wasn't easy trying to find it, but when I finally caught it at a local art house theater, I was further interested in the story that had yet to unfold. Since it was based on the centuries-old Japanese folktale, I know it has been told differently many times by various writers in literature, theater, even film. Nevertheless, I had to check out Studio Ghibli's take on the classic story.It's about an elder bamboo cutter named Okina who discovers a young, tiny girl in a bamboo shoot and decides to adopt her as his own along with his loving wife Ona. As years progress, the tiny girl begins to grow rapidly to normal size like the other children of their village, eventually having to leave since her adoptive parents decide to have her raised among the nobles. From there, she is given the name ""Princess Kaguya"" and things become further complicated when so much is offered to her so suddenly.When comparing this movie to past Studio Ghibli efforts, it's obvious that the animation style is nothing like its preceding films. And with studio founder Hayao Miyazaki having stepped down and no involvement with this current project, I have to say it's a drastic, yet vibrant change in what Studio Ghibli is widely known for. I loved the story and it had an ending that was rather heartwarming and enough to tug anyone's heartstrings. With the English dub voice of Kaguya done gracefully by Chloe Grace-Moretz (Let Me In, Carrie, If I Stay), she actually stands out well as the title character, like it wasn't forced. The animation technique was rather intricate, but it was reminiscent of an old Japanese art painting I've once studied about in Art History classes at my local college. American animation studios have believed traditional 2-D to be a dying art form in the film industry these days, but I can tell Japan does not acknowledge it in that way at all, whether it's TV or film. The concept I started believing for the entire film felt like ""a timeless painting"" and it's quite a stroke of genius, in my opinion.The music and underscore of Joe Hisaishi has left me engaged that it flows evenly well with the scenes as they play out. But most notably, director Isao Takahata really stepped up following his involvements with titles like ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""My Neighbor The Yamadas,"" and even the touching ""Grave of the Fireflies."" This entire movie has earned its rightful place in the Studio Ghibli library. This is another example of a Ghibli film where you don't have to be an avid Japanese Anime fan to enjoy it, what matters is that such themes existed in various genres, not just in one medium or one genre alone."
4,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,10 December 2014,Masterpiece,"The Tale of Princess Kaguya's is Takahata's final work to end his prolific career at Studio Ghibli. The motion picture is not only based on the famous Japanese folktale but also a story about Takahata's own retirement and vision of death. Behind the facade of a girl that grows up to become a princess and eventually leave earth for the moon, is the author's own perceptions about the cycles of life, happiness, disappointments and afterlife. It's also a message about family values, and the lapses of time and age. The tale of princess Kaguya is probably my favorite Ghibli movie visually-wise. The water colors, reminiscent of ancient Chinese ink and brush techniques are masterfully used here, and bring out all the emotions from the movie's main protagonists. It really doesn't get any better than this. From the landscape canvas of rural Japan, to the magnificent character artwork, everything moves fluidly. The story is both hopeful and tragic, and the excellent dialogue adds up to it. The soundtrack from Joe Hisaishi is masterful and the Japanese voice overs are absolutely brilliant. To summarize without giving away too many details, this 140 min animated picture is a masterpiece from all angles, one of Studio Ghibli's finest releases and arguably one of the greatest animated movies ever made."
5,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,21 December 2014,One of Ghiblis Best Movies,"I was a bit anxious before seeing this movie because it is not from Miyazaki but after seeing it I can say that there was no reason to be anxious about this movie. It's probably the most beautiful movie I've ever seen and it is equally as good, if not even better as spirited away and princess mononoke. The story is wonderfully told and it has some extremely sad moments. But probably the best thing about this movie is the breath taking animation. It's just incredibly beautiful and just so unique that you just won't forget it. As always for a Ghibli movie the movie has an eye for detail and you just feel the passion which was put into this movie. This movie was one of the best anime I have ever seen and probably also one of the best movies I have ever seen."
6,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,7 August 2014,perfect,"what an amazing experience.probably the best movie i will ever see.gorgeous animation, great storytelling, what a pity it had to end.there isn't really much more to say about it.forget about people's problems with it.just go and see it.i'm probably biased since i love the style and am interested in Japanese culture and Buddhism.if you even have an inkling of interest in these you will probably love it.PS: IMDb, your criteria for review submission are ridiculous to put it mildly."
7,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,24 January 2015,animation of the decade,"The animation masterpiece of the decade. Takahata is going out on top. The fabled north American distribution deal between Disney and Studio Ghibli (apparently) applies only to the works of Myazaki; north American distribution of this is being handled by GKIDS. So the heavyweight marketing of Pixar/Disney isn't behind it. But don't be fooled by its ""art-house"" distribution or its relative obscurity - this is a really big deal.It's an ""epic"", having taken eight years to produce and clocking in at well over two hours. I haven't seen the words ""production committee"" in credits since 'Akira' - that means it was too big for any one normal producer, so several companies had to form a ""consortium"": Studio Ghibli itself, a TV network, a foreign corporation, a movie studio, and three others. And the animation work itself was so large that parts of it were farmed out to _nine_ other studios.There are two versions: an English dub of the soundtrack with most things written in English characters (although in general dubs suck, animation is often an exception); and a Japanese soundtrack with written English subtitles and most things (including virtually all the credits) written in Japanese characters. If the names of the voice actors you hear sound vaguely familiar, that's the English dub version. In fact, if you're viewing this in a theater, unless the theater is pretty sophisticated, you won't even have a choice - you'll see only the English dub version. And that's okay.You get what you're used to from Studio Ghibli: powerful and independent women characters, a strong bond with the natural world, seamless switches back and forth between reality and fantasy, rootedness in tradition and folklore, and the music of Joe Hisaishi. Add to that some themes I associate specifically with Takahata: portrayals of ""reality"" even when it's quite sad, nostalgia, an acceptance and open portrayal of the concept of the ""cycle of life"", and ambivalence toward tradition and especially patriarchy (respecting and illustrating the good, while at the same time poking fun at the bad). Finally add a new twist I haven't seen in animation before: whole scenes where all the dialog, the visuals, and even the music, point to one interpretation ...only to recast the whole thing in a different light at the end to reach a totally unexpected conclusion.The animation is 2D and very intricate, but still appears hand-drawn. Outlines vary in thickness and density, and colored areas don't always reach exactly to an outline. It could be computer-drawn (as many apparently hand-drawn animations actually are these days) only if the computer made an awful lot of ""mistakes"". Interestingly, the figures and the backgrounds look exactly the same (not different styles of animation as is often the case). It's all colored with pastels. The end result looks somewhat as though 'My Neighbors the Yamadas' had been used as starting sketches which were then finished.I thought my evaluation of ""hand drawn"" was vindicated when a whole screenful of the end credits was occupied with the names of all the in-betweeners. But then just a bit later the whole screen was again filled with one category of names, this time all the digital ink and painters. Sometimes what you'd expect to be computer-generated is in fact clearly hand drawn, as when shadows move just a bit awkwardly between the beginning and the end of a scene. Other times the effect really seems computer-generated, as when a character is seen in a side closeup crashing through vegetation with lots and lots of branches flying much faster than anyone could draw them, or as when there's a cross-fade between scenes. I could never even guess though how it had been done when occasionally I could see what was behind a bit of translucent cloth."
8,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,5 December 2014,This is not a mere Animation this is an experience,"I watched the movie in Japanese with subtitle, and found it moving, touching and entertaining. Like other Ghibli productions these are not mere animations they are experiences. A kind of the movie that remains with you for a long time. Unlike Hollywood movies and animation that once the credit roles you have forgotten it. This animation takes you away from artificial shallow and politically correct world of ours that everything has a motive and or lobbied by some interest group, where humanity is sold to some faction or interest group. One of the reviewers had the temerity to mention this movie in the same sentence as Lego movie please don't. This is an accomplishment and the latter is a travesty. Don't even mention the Fem. Word in this vicinity."
9,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,10 November 2014,Awesome fairy tale,"Based on real Japanese folklore, the animation takes its tone from those original artworks I've seen on Japanese scrolls, and mixes it with contemporary anime.I love the way animation can take such simple things as eating a melon or watching birds fly into a tree so much more exciting. By using traditional animation (although I need notice some computerize layouts),The Japanese have done it again with their personal approach to the detail of animation you can only get from 2D.Adding to my enjoyment, this English adaption of the film includes the voice talent of Chloë Grace Moretz as the princess, who I've become a fan of. It was very beautiful artwork moving across the big screen."
10,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,,7 December 2014,Delightful and sort of frustrating,"I liked this to a good extent, and my rating goes up because of the last 15 minutes, which are so magnificent. Those last several minutes and the first act are truly brilliant, but for some reason, the film sort of lost me in its middle and a little more than that. Not completely lost me, but it did get a little too much and it got to less interesting overall. I can't say I completely agree with the critical acclaim it's gotten, but I think it's a good, sometimes very good, film, definitely made stronger because of certain scenes. The sound mixing here is incredible, and the voice acting (in its original language) is pretty fantastic as well. Overall, still recommended but with reservations, yeah."
11,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,4,19 March 2015,A Pretty Letdown,"(originally seen at http://goo.gl/UNpKrF)The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is an animated film based on what is widely believed to be the first canonical story in Japanese folklore, which is a lofty goal. It's generally a good sign to see the name of Studio Ghibli in the title cards, but even with the legendary abilities of Ghibli-trained animators rendering a story in a hand-drawn, highly emotive style, it ultimately fell quite flat for me.The problem comes solely down to the direction of Isao Takahata. His style is a vast departure from the work of Miyazaki, and while I'm certainly not a purist as far as how a film should look, Takahata-san has missed several very important lessons from the studio's legendary founder, and those lessons cover all the ways in which Kaguya failed for me.G Kids also distributed one of my favorites films of all time this last year: Song of the Sea. Tomm Moore knows, as Miyazaki knows, that your artwhile stylizedmust have a consistent focus and theme to it. Kaguya is unfettered, blending art and animation styles between artists with no theme. Characters are drawn vastly different from each other, looking like caricatures of trolls more than people at times, with no central idea or motif to make the world seem like anything but a mash-up. If you pay attention to Song of the Sea or, say, The Wind Rises (one of my favorites of Miyazaki's catalog), you see the art style carried through every character, every setting, and every detail. That's the kind of direction that a story needs, one where the details are crafted, not left to whims and crumpled together in the edit.While the story is a sad and heartfelt one, its presentation suffers greatly as Takahata really foregoes centuries of storytelling know-how, ensuring that audiences will have to expend a great deal of effort to engage with the plot. Kaguya (voiced by Chloë Grace Moretz in the English dub), is a goddess descended from the moon to live with a poor unnamed bamboo cutter and his wife (James Cann and Mary Steenburgen, respectively). For reasons left unexplained, the child grows from an infant to an adolescent in a matter of weeks (if that), and is blessed with a gift of gold and silks from the stalks of bamboo plants, which sends her father into an apoplectic fit of narcissism, self-absorbed negligence, and social-climbing ambition. He pulls Kaguya into the city to be raised as royalty in an effort to try to feel fulfilled on his own, and Kaguya is miserable until she's eventually called back to the moon due to reasons we never get the time to know, because she's off the screen and the movie's over in less than ten minutes after we first hear of it.This plot, disjointed as it is, sets up a lot of dissonance. It's hard to understand why she's so reluctant to return to the moon (much less how she knows of her destiny) when her father was such a miserable person to her for pretty much her entire life, using her to gain some semblance of self-worth. I never got any time to try to relate to her, or to glean any sense of her relationship with others. The plot skips when it should walk and crawls when it should run. At over two hours long, it both rushes and drags in ways I haven't seen in cinema for many years now. Stories like this are the reason so many storytelling tropes have been invented and accepted over the years. The standard Three-Act Plot, the classic Show, Don't Tell rule, pacing curvesmost of the rules of fiction are shown here rather conspicuously by their absence.Sadly, there's not much else to save it. The music is fitting, and not overbearing. It's nothing I'd rush to find the OST for, but it's well-done. The voice acting for the three main characters is worth applauding, but outside of that, we're again stuck with the traditional Disney-style parade of A-list celebrities who really have no ability to voice act at all. The performances are characteristically stilted and flat, which might fit the Disney-imported trend, but it's hardly required.Kaguya is a film that people have been lining up to throw perfect scores at like so many roses to a bullfighter, so I realize that I'm certainly not setting myself up for a popular review here. There's probably not many ways to make more enemies online than harshly criticizing a Studio Ghibli film, but here we are. I'm afraid that Kaguya is a rare miss from this studio, perhaps the exception that proves the rule of Miyazaki-san's excellence as a traditionalyet culture-spanningstoryteller.Scores (out of 10) Acting: 6 Story: 3 Visuals: 6 Sound: 5 Enjoyment: 3 Overall Score: 4/10"
12,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,5,28 December 2014,a bit overrated?,"I have to declare that am not aware of the creator or the Japanese tale this was based on and certainly no expert in Japanese animation and/or folklore. The truth is I watched it by accident.So this is supposed to be ""One of the best movies of the year""? Well, I was not impressed, at least not as much as everyone seems to be. I didn't mind the animation style, but I certainly didn't find much beauty in it, or feeling, or emotions.. I looked childish and simple but with no heart, it was kind of dry. Story wise, it was unoriginal and after a while boring. And way too long: it had a promising start, but after they moved to the Capital the story stalled. It never managed to put me inside its world and make me feel something about its universe or the Princess.So to conclude, the story never moved me and the animation never talked to me.. the 5 is only for the first 40mins or so and the last 15, especially the scene when she meets again with her child love."
13,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,3 November 2014,Breathtaking visuals with an interesting but unsteady plot,"The first thing to note about this film is the beauty of it. Just about all of the scenes of this film could be viewed in a museum which is saying something itself. If anything, watch the film for the portrayal of a young woman and the amazing visuals.The film begins with a bamboo cutter finding a girl inside the light of a bamboo. The girl grows exponentially and she grows with the plot, going from baby to young adult way quicker than expected.The first portion of the film is concentrated when she is much younger, (around the age of maybe 1-12?). Her playfulness with Sutemaru and the other children is quite an enjoyable portion of the film. As with many of Studio Ghibli's work, especially Totoro, the film is able to portray her life in a way many studios even without animation cannot.The other half is concentrated on her moving to the capital and becoming a princess. Unlike the ideals of films in the US, she does not seem to want to become one, but instead wants to be with Sutemaru and the others. It's a refreshing change from the Disney Princess motif where beauty, richness, and a love is what is needed. Her life is transformed, eventually by Sagami, a lady who turns her into well, a princess. She is eventually approached by suitors and others.I will not mention the ending of the film as well, I wasn't as big a fan of it. The big revelation is as shocking to the audience as it is surprising. I knew of part of the plot through Okami but the way it was portrayed was a little too in your face. The actual ending itself is odd, with many of the people in the theater (at IFC) scratching their heads and thinking, ""That is it and what was that?"" Also, I was wondering when the film was going to end. It slows down to a crawl but then speeds up to such a speed that it almost becomes silly.I also wasn't as a big a fan of the father (Okina) through the later parts of the film. His transformation into a man of power/wealth is a bit too severe and one-sided. I preferred his wife (Oina) as she still shows the love and playfulness of them back in the village.I preferred the plot of the first 4/5ths of the film than the other 1/5th in short. The film is excellent but the plot wears down on itself and by the end, it is harder to care and more think that it is just an odd piece of filming. The movie gets an 8.5...but probably would be closer to an 8 or 7.5 if the graphics/music weren't nearly as amazing as they are. I'm rounding it down for this reason."
14,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,18 July 2017,"Lovingly crafted over the course of eight years, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is an animated masterpiece unlike any other.","I can look back to a few experiences that completely changed the way that I watch movies; one of these is the first time that I saw Stanley Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece 2001: A Space Oddysey, which showed me the purest example of film as an art form that I had ever seen. I saw it not too long after I graduated high school and had never experienced a movie that expressed complex and confusing thoughts in the way that it did nor in such a visually stunning way. The film went beyond conventional narrative and filmmaking to deliver something entirely new to me.In a similar manner, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya represents a level of artistry that I had never before seen in an animated feature. From the brilliant mind of Studio Ghibli's lesser-known co- founder Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday), the film is an adaptation of Japan's oldest folk tale, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. It tells the story of a strange girl (Asakura/Moretz) who is discovered inside a bamboo stalk and who shoots through her childhood at a rapid pace. Her adoptive parents (Chii/Caan, Miyamoto/Steenburgen) bring her into the city, where she is groomed as a noblewoman and comes to be widely sought after for her beauty.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is simply gorgeous; its visual style combines watercolor painting and charcoal sketching to create something that is entirely its own. Personal and often unnecessary care is given to the smallest details, such as a toddler crawling after a frog or the princess casually putting her hair up. The character and quality of the animation even change with the tone of the story, most noticeably in one instance in which the princess' despair completely overwhelms her. As the world is stripped away and sound is simplified to almost nothing, the scene so perfectly expresses the character's personality and mood and presents such a perfect image of her story that to me, it fully represents the reasons that animation exists as a medium. Because there are no live actors or sets and no real world in which the filmmakers must do their work, the artists are free to fully express themselves as artists, without the constraints of the real world. Rather than use animation to simply bring color to a bland story as many animators are wont to do, the creators here use the deep story and visuals to produce situations and imagery that would otherwise be impossible to create. The movie spends much of its run time grounded firmly in reality  sometimes uncomfortably so  but at its most powerful, it extends far beyond what live action can achieve.The film is also thematically rich, particularly exploring the societal roles of Japanese women at the time depicted. When she is no longer allowed to live her simple life around her childhood friends, her life becomes dedicated to presenting herself as beautiful and submissive to the world. She is instructed to sit still and to look pretty, never mind the fact that she is often hidden from view. She is whisked away to be married as soon as she reaches puberty and is told by both the men and women around that a rich husband will be the source of her greatest happiness.Kaguya herself is a wonderful character to watch. She is at times one of the happiest people you could imagine but at others one of the saddest. After all, she started walking over the course of a day and grew into the body of a teenager in less than a year's time. Her innocence is shown as a blessing and a curse, and seeing her interact with the variety of people she encounters provides the film plenty of joy and drama.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya uses the language of cinema in a way that, in my experience watching animation, has been truly special; through blocking of scenes, visual symbolism, color, and much more, the film is able to speak to us beyond its surface narrative and to tell a more robust story. It makes full use of the opportunities unique to animation and combines them with tools of the great live- action masterpieces of the past.The film, for example, often separates the princess from the rest of the world, particularly in scenes in which she is hidden from sight. She is often placed behind a screen or behind bamboo blinds for narrative purposes, but even when these are not present, there is often an element visually keeping her from other characters, such as a bamboo stalk or a tall blade of grass placed between them. While not forming a true wall between the characters, the viewer can see them separated and feel their distance.This film also offers a wonderful experience of sound and silence through the use of its score, which consists of tracks mostly under two minutes long. This allows each moment of music to have its power and meaning, while not overwhelming the viewing experience or directing the viewer along every step of the film's vast emotional landscape. Through contrapuntal folk sounds or delicate solo piano, the film is able to sing its story to us as it shows it and tells it. The musical pieces and the silence between them are given the full attention that they deserve and in turn give us exactly what we need.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. While critical response at its release was overwhelmingly positive, far too few people have heard of it, and even fewer have seen it. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is a movie that you will never forget and offers an experience not quite like anything else you will ever see."
15,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,,10 January 2016,"Aesthetically Pleasing, Artistically Fulfilling & Emotionally Captivating!","One of Studio Ghibli's last feature films before the legendary animation studio went on an indefinite break, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is Isao Takahata's first picture in over 15 years and happens to be an eloquently narrated, gorgeously animated & patiently paced cinema that attempts to bring on screen one of the oldest tales in Japanese folklore.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya tells the story of its titular character who was found in a bamboo shoot by a bamboo cutter who, believing her to be a divine presence, brings her home to his wife. Although this mysterious tiny girl grows rapidly into a young lady, dazzling all who encounters her, she eventually is left with no alternative but to confront her own fate.Co-written & directed by Isao Takahata (best known for Grave of the Fireflies), this tale is crafted with precision care & elegance plus how all of it is animated brings an artistic vibe of its own. The use of colour palette, sketch-like animation & minimalist approach leaves a lasting impression, the voice performances are spot-on while Joe Hisaishi's score nicely compliments the whole narrative.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya also covers the various restraints women find themselves in every facet of life, no matter what society they happen to be part of, and exposes that without preaching. However, its 137 minutes of runtime feels a tad too long, the final act is stretched, and although its creativity is undeniably impressive, the whole story kind of lacks that immersive element, much like Takahata's earlier works.On an overall scale, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya brims with some truly astonishing images and is another winning marvel from the acclaimed studio. It's aesthetically pleasing, artistically fulfilling & emotionally gripping and there are going to be many who will have nothing but endless praise for the manner in which this ancient Japanese folklore is illustrated on the film canvas. As for me, I do admire a number of things about Takahata's latest but don't feel any love for it. Still, I've no qualms in recommending it to anyone for it is worthy of a broader audience."
16,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,11 August 2015,it's an excellent piece of animation and a great story.,"The famous Japanese movie production company 'Studio Ghibli' is known mostly for Hayao Miyazaki's film resume that ranges from 'Spirited Away' to 'The Wind Rises'. Studio Ghibli continues to put out beautiful and important animated films that not only tell an amazing story, but it also touches on several political, religious, and societal issues that are relevant all over the world. And Miyazaki's films have conjured up a large global audience that has developed into a cult following that is bigger than ever today.But this film 'The Tale of Princess Kaguya' is not a Miyazaki film. Instead, this is an Isao Takahata film and is not your typical Japanese animated film that has sleek CG animated effects or female characters that dress in next to nothing. 'Princess Kaguya' is a 137 minute film that is 100% hand drawn and is a story from the 10th century, which is called 'The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter'. Many people say that this is one of the first if not the first science fiction story ever thought up. And when I say science-fiction, I'm not insinuating aliens, space ships or far off planets with lasers. Instead, this wonderful story starts out with a middle aged man and his wife who live a quiet life in the mountains.This man is a bamboo cutter, who uses bamboo for food, shelter, baskets, and clothing. While working in the bamboo field, he notices a strange glow from one of the bamboo trees. When he investigates, he notices a little seedling that is rapidly growing. In it is a tiny little person who is alive. He takes this small person back to his wife where it transforms into a baby girl, who grows very fast too. The bamboo cutter and his wife think that heaven sent her down to Earth to become the most beautiful princess there ever was. As she grows up fast, her parents collect gold and fine clothing from the magical bamboo tree, which he has a giant palace in the city built for her.The bulk of this long movie shows this magical princess growing up and adjusting to her new wealthy and powerful life. Her father hires a teacher to instruct her on how to be a proper lady and princess, but the princess would rather laugh, dance, play in the fields, and sing than live a life of boredom in 10th century Japan. In addition to this being one of the first science-fiction stories, it also has a lot of feministic and women's rights qualities to it, which is always great to see.Another big part of the story has five of the wealthiest and powerful men in Japan vying for her love and marriage, to which she has never met any of them. She sends each of them on impossible tasks to prove their love for her, but it's really a ploy to see if they truly care about her or if they just want her as a piece of property. One of the overall story arcs is the love between the princess and a young boy she was friends with when they were little, where their paths cross rarely throughout the course of this movie, but their love is still binding them together, even they are so far away.This PG family friendly film might be too slow for most, where as anime buffs might take a stronger liking to it, but as the ending draws closer, the more bizarre the film gets, taking you out of the whole point of the story. The best parts are towards the beginning of the film, watching the princess grow up. It has such a wonderful and carefree charm about it that should make you smile. The animation is beautiful and simple and wonderfully colored. It's a real treat to see something illustrated fully by hand without the use of computers these days. The 137 minute run time is a bit long and could have played out better as a mini series, as this film is fairly episodic, but none-the-less, it's an excellent piece of animation and a great story. I just think it got away from itself from time to time and took too long to tell."
17,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,6 May 2015,Isao Takahata strikes again,"14 years after directing the underrated My Neighbors the Yamadas, director Isao Takahata finally released his new film. Based on the oldest, and apparently most well-known folktale in Japan, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. (spoilers) It details the life (and times) of Kaguya, a small girl who originates from a city on the moon, is sent to earth where she excels in the simple farm life, suffers under life as a lady in the city and eventually returns to the moon. It's a story containing both realist and surreal elements, a combination that Takahata has perfected in his films. Though apparently a very popular tale in Japan, the story isn't exactly blockbuster material. Nevertheless, Takahata followed his own vision and has crafted a highly effective film replete with all the love and care and obsessive attention to detail Studio Ghibli has become known for.We first see (what else) a bamboo cutter discovering a robed girl, Kaguya of course, as small as his hand in a forest. He takes her into his home with his wife where Kaguya grows abnormally fast. She lives a happy country life with friends etc. Eventually, the bamboo cutter cuts another bamboo tree and to his astonishment finds gold. He becomes something of a rich man and convinces his wife that by moving to the capital, they'll finally be able to grant Kaguya the kind of life that will make her happy. Of course, life as a lady is only suffocating to the free-spirited Kaguya who alternates between having to learn and accept the lifestyle of a 'proper lady' and wanting to desperately escape the city.Naturally, the film looks stunning. Takahata utilizes a palette consisting mostly of soft pastels and charcoal. Characters are drawn in minimalist, though highly distinct fashions. The soft pastels and charcoal textures aren't just eye candy however, but fit with the story's ancient origins, the film looking as if drawings on ancient Japanese scrolls were coming to life. As befits Takahata, visuals are also used to externally emphasize a character's inner life and feelings. One particularly amazing scene, showing Kaguya desperately fleeing the capital, begins with pastels and charcoal, but soon grows more aggressive, with more and more harsh charcoal lines, reflecting Kaguya's inner turmoil as she flees It's quite simply one of those scenes where you realize you are, at that very moment, witnessing 'art' taking place in front of your eyes; in other words, the greatest thing you could possibly experience in a movie theater. Personally, I can only level two complaints at the film: one, the surrealist aspect of the story was a bit hard to digest. I'm referring to the moment when Kaguya realizes she's from the moon and has to return there. There's something strange about watching a scene where she outright tells her 'parents' she's from the moon when the film up until this point was highly realistic in tone, despite the surrealist opening scene where she's found by the bamboo cutter. Two, the film is perhaps a tad too long. I have nothing against long (animated) films per se, but here I eventually felt exhaustion entering my body. I think this is an issue inherent to the story and the fact that it isn't exactly the most varied plot. There are basically only two environments: the landscapes depicting nature and life in the city. As befitting Takahata's later output, the tempo is quite slow and this will be hard for viewers who are unfamiliar with Takahata to digest. In its favor, I find the slow tempo to also be to the film's benefit. Like Kaguya, the viewer also grows tired of the city's endless parade of suitors and emphasis on etiquette.I've read articles where people question the point of this film. Why would Takahata adapt this story? After directing films like Grave of the Fireflies and Only Yesterday, why would he turn to Japan's oldest folktale? I believe the reason can be found in the end of the film. At one point, Kaguya is hesitant to go back to the moon and leave earth and all she's experienced. Even later, she has a small monologue about earthly life in general with all the beautiful and negative experiences she's accumulated. The point she's making is that despite the things she's experienced during her days as a 'lady' in the city, she still loves earthly life. Think back to Takahata's Only Yesterday with its positive outlook on people and life despite all the dramatic events. Both films prefer the honest farmer's life as opposed to city life. Think back to Yamadas which is an even more overt celebration of daily life in all its normalcy. Kaguya fits easily within this most important of themes in Takahata's filmography."
18,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,21 February 2015,Great use of art!,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. The colour and detail in the sketches. Specific detail was added where the viewers eye was meant to go. (though I did quite enjoy laughing at the several tiny babies that were left partially drawn) It is quite refreshing to notice the attention paid to the sketches that went over the changes of the seasons. The detail with the insects, plants, flowers and animals.Another aspect that really brings quite an effect into the story would be the colour scheme; colourful, ocher/grey, red. The drawings alone are impressive but the additional colour REALLY brings out the emotion behind the ongoing story. I found the story rather strange because certain parts were confusing. I think this is one film I shall keep in my list to see again."
19,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,5,17 March 2015,Simple tale that cold have been told in one hour turned into a two hour long torture,"Simple tale that cold have been told in one hour turned into a two hour long torture.The film started out in a great way, but when they moved to the capital it started to drag on too much until the last 15 minutes of the film that were a lot of non-sense. I don't get how people get so touched and love films that have a lot of drama with a basic storyline and pointless ending. Some nice visuals, but not stunning. Some nice moments,but not touching enough. Nice subject, but not a good story after all."
20,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,7,19 February 2015,It looks lovely,"""The Tale of Princess Kaguya"" is a very, very familiar story in Japan. It's from a story that is a thousand years old, ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter"". And, since it's a classic, there have been many movie versions of the story. Because of this, I was quite familiar with this, as I'd already seen ""Princess From the Moon""--a 1987 live-action version. Unlike the other six versions of the story that I was able to find, this one is animated and it comes from Studio Ghibli--the same people who make the Miyazaki films, though this one is from Isao Takahata.For the most part, the story you see in the film is the old tale. One day, a poor woodcutter slices into a stalk of bamboo and finds a beautiful thumb-size child. Since he and his wife are childless and have always wanted one, they are overjoyed with the discovery and raise the child. However, the same fortune that brought them the baby also rewarded them with gold when the woodcutter chopped additional bamboo. And, oddly, the child grows to normal size and becomes a lady in practically no time at all. Soon they are rich and able to give their girl the life of a princess and she's taught all manners and customs that a proper lady would need. However, it's obvious that young Princess Kaguya isn't happy in this life, as courtier after courtier come for her hand and she simply isn't interested. So, she gives them impossible tasks to complete before she'd agree to marry any of them. When they all fail, the Emperor himself comes to court her but she rebuffs him--mostly because she knows her time on Earth is drawing to a close. Where all this goes next, you'll find out if you watch the movie.The animation for this movie is quite lovely--with a nice look that appears as if the film was made with colored pencils and watercolors. While it's more minimalistic than you'd usually find in a Ghibli film, it looks very appropriate to the Medieval Japanese period. In fact, the look of the film is the best thing about the movie. The story, as you probably noticed above, is odd--especially to non-Japanese audiences. The ending, is even odder, by the way. But the film still could have worked despite the unusual story. However, I found the pacing to be too slow and I noticed my attention waning from time to time. Not surprisingly, it's the longest film released by Ghibli to date. Had they trimmed about 15 to 20 minutes and removed the plot involving the poor boyfriend (which was not in the original story), I think the film would have worked better for me. Worth seeing for a very patient audience who is looking for something very different--otherwise a strange sort of picture that probably would offer little appeal to kids and folks wanting something light and Disney-like.By the way, although I was not bowled over by this film, it has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. My vote is for ""The Box Trolls""...a film which managed to combine both artistry and an excellent original story."
21,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,5,20 February 2016,Disappointing,"Like many others, I've been following Studio Ghibli for decades. I always found its stories to be mature, as well as fitting for younger audiences. Stories for adults with a child's heart. I also liked the way they -almost- always offered some hope, regardless how dramatic or even gloomy they could get.Unfortunately, this tale is for mature audiences only, I'd say, and it's rather depressing, overall.There's nothing wrong with the film per se; the animation takes a very traditional approach and it becomes even simplistic, separating itself vastly from most Ghibli productions. The storytelling can get dull for people who are not into drama, with its 2 hours and 17 minutes in length.Besides, this movie lacks also a certain sense of movement which other Ghibli films had, mostly in the form of unapologetic action. The pace is quite tranquil, with one or two rushy moments, without reaching the peaks achieved in previous Ghibli films (and no real action).I liked other Takahata movies, like Pom Poko, Only Yesterday, My Neighbors the Yamadas and Grave of the Fireflies (being the latest pretty grim, as well).Alas, it's a movie for the taste of critics for sure. Pity that their tastes do not have anything to do with the youth, and the message Ghibli delivers to them in other films is lost here to a more mature and disenchanted audience."
22,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,23 January 2015,Ghibli goes back to the roots,"After some questionable ventures, Studio Ghibli returns to its success formula: interesting stories rooted in Japanese folklore, featuring a young girl or woman in the beautiful countryside. Couldn't possibly go wrong with the oldest prose story that probably gave mount Fuji its name.The animation is top notch, the acting is really good - the old man was delicious - and the story is both archetypal and heart breaking. There are some problems with the film though, one of them being the slow development that required more than two hours of film to unfold, as well as the rather uneventful and fractured ending.The story is that of a magical child found in a bamboo stalk. It grows really fast turning into a beautiful girl. The bamboos also offer gold and beautiful clothes, so that the old country couple that found and raised her move her to the capital to turn her into a ""proper lady"". However the ridiculous restrictions and rigid customs bring nothing than unhappiness to the otherwise energetic and nature loving girl. In her desperation she mentally asks for help and she is taken back to the Moon, where she was originally from, to a place of spirits, light, but no life or emotions, only purity. So there were Nazis on the Moon after all, huh?There are other Ghibli animations that I like more, most of them, in fact, but I feel like this film is a promise that they will return to stories focused or inspired from Japanese traditions, rather than go with stuff like The Borrowers. Why ruin a perfectly good system that brought them a huge and faithful fandom? It is also a beautiful moody story that speaks to the viewer of youth, life and the desire to be free, even against all the best wishes of the people around you. I recommend it."
23,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,6,4 March 2015,"Admirable craft, pity the story does nothing for me.","I'm yet to find an anime that I love, and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya isn't it. I just don't connect to ancient Japanese culture and all of its downsides are in the story. The character work is solid, but it's archetypal stuff and still nothing that digs deep in a relatable way. This is just a type of whimsy that I don't enjoy, and at 2 hours, it's more of a chore. But at least it's a pretty chore. No doubt you marvel at the animation, especially during the dramatic running sequences. The fluttering music tends to match the lightness of the visuals. I respect Takahata, as I do for Miyasaki, but his Graves of the Fireflies did nothing for me as well. Outside the man hours put into it, Kaguya is nothing special.6/10"
24,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,6,27 November 2014,It all comes down to whether you like the animation,"""Kaguyahime no monogatari"" or ""The Tale of The Princess Kaguya"" is the newest Studio Ghibli movie. You may know director Isao Takahata, who turns 80 next year, from ""Grave of the Fireflies"" or the 1970's TV show ""Heidi"".As I wrote in the title, the way you will perceive this film is gonna depend a lot on how you like the animation. It is almost like a children's book and certainly not everybody's cup of tea as it's just so different, not only compared to what Disney and Pixar did in recent years, but also compared to other Ghibli films, such as Miyazaki's work. If you appreciate the style, however, you will surely like this movie. Checking out the trailer before might be a particularly good idea here to get a grasp of what you can expect. By the mere looks of it, this film could also have been made 50 years ago.My favorite part was possibly the first 45 minutes, the time Kaguya spends with her ""parents"" in the village before they move to the city. It's just all so harmonic and easy-going. Quite a shame, her father had something else for her in mind as otherwise we may have gotten the same for another 90 minutes. The life in the city and Kaguya's transformation were good to watch too, but not really for the story than for all the cultural and social references of Japan. The stories with her admirers were solid, but somehow I felt something was missing. The ending was a good idea. I liked the return-to-the-moon plot, but I wished it would have been done without all these moon people coming down to get her. I actually really liked the sequence, where she flies up with her childhood crush and this could have worked as a better ending in my opinion. But at least, they did not go for a forced happy ending.I am not sure about the Japanese version, but the German dubbed version I saw had a female narrator with very little text that was really not necessary in my opinion. One particularly interesting thing about the story was her relationship with her father. Even if he was the driving force for her different new life, which she did not appreciate at all, she was always as loving to him as she was towards her mother. This film offers lots of room for interpretation. Was the finding of the bamboo with a girl inside just as unlikely as the mother giving birth to her at that age and was the girl actually suffering from an illness that resulted in her early death? What about the quick growing early on and the normal growing later on? With that early speed, she must have surpassed her parents in terms of age quickly. And what about the bamboo reference? Do these grew tall quickly and stay the same till they die after 25 or so years? Is there a botanist in the room? This film is on the preselection for Academy Award Best Animated Feature Films and it will be interesting to see if it can make the cut and score the nomination or even possibly win. To make a decision for myself, I still have to see some of the other films on that list. Kaguya, however, is certainly worth watching and there were only really very few moments where I felt it dragged a bit, unsurprisingly with such a long runtime, especially for an animated movie. It was all very rewarding as the song that played during the closing credits was pretty beautiful."
25,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,4,13 October 2016,Like watching ink dry.,"This film takes its time. It's slow paced to a fault and at over 2 hours, well out stays its welcome.The story is meandering, convoluted and doesn't make efficient use of the visual medium to deliver information, rather it feels more like listening to a slowly narrated audio book whilst flicking through some nice illustrations. I was intensely bored by most of it, despite the undeniable charm of some of the animation, I felt there wasn't any effort to engage the viewer on a deeper level with more dynamic film language or snappier, cleverer story telling. You can say that Japanese story structure is fundamentally different from Western methods, often employing a 'watch the grass grow' approach that celebrates silence, ritual and mood over Pixar's noisy barrage of constant challenges. I have found that difference to be quite refreshing in other films like ""Spirited Away"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" but ""Kaguya"", in comparison really lacked engaging characters and virtually any moments of dynamic tension.The art style in my opinion isn't terribly good compensation for this. While there are moments of exquisite gestural animation - the sequence where the princess rushes through the woods leaving a trail of fluttering garments in her wake, is gorgeous- overall the character designs are rather crude, pale and ugly, looking more like rough pencil sketches than the refined, noble and highly graphic woodblock prints they appear to emulate.It's a shame, I really wanted to love ""Kaguya"", but I don't think I could sit through it again."
26,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,16 January 2015,"Funny, heart-warming, but also sorrow.","I am not an artsy person, but I think Isao Takahata brings State-To-The-Art to the animated movie. The classic hand-drawn like with touched of colors, and 3D rendered on several small scenes (e.g. the falling leaves, grass), picking up different layer of colors to adjust the mood of the scenes amazed me. This PG-rated animated movie has some scenes that were shocking me (depicting woman's breast, boy's genital, etc.), but this overwhelmed to the overall quality and storyline for the entire film. Some of the scenes might also bring confusion to the younger audiences due to the godly character of the princess that amazed other characters.I think compare to other Western animated films, this could be compared to UP or Toy Story because it has the element of comedy, heart-warming, but could also stirred-up emotions -- although this particular movie has different inside jokes that Westerners may not get. Audiences would also learn some of the Japanese tradition, culture, and manners by watching this movie. Awesome soundtracks too! Takahata has brought the traditional folklore to the modern cinema."
27,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,1 April 2017,Good enough,"If not for the story, than surely for the art work, this film is a masterpiece. The pictures were perfect, like a moving water painting that portrayed spring time. But not only the scenery was stunning; the characters were drawn in detail, making them look realistic and closer to a real person. The story was nice as well. The description made it look like the story of Thumbelina or something, but it's not. I think it's based on a folklore Japanese tale, but I'm not sure. Still, it was very interesting, and had this rustic vibe, with the moon princess being sent to earth to live among the humans. The fantasy element is there, however, the story contains some real human emotions and situations, with manly the love for the countryside life and the family bond to overpower any other story of romance or magical kingdoms. So, 8 out of 10."
28,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,26 November 2016,Another soulful and quite beautiful film from Studio Ghibli,"You have to hand it to Studio Ghibli, they really do know how to make exquisitely beautiful films. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is yet another example of this. Its story is based on the oldest folklore tale from Japan. It starts off with a tiny girl being found in a forest by a bamboo cutter. He takes her home to his wife and she immediately transforms into a baby and then grows up with rapid speed. Soon it is believed that she must be a magical princess and she is moved to the city to live in a palace. While here she experiences some unhappiness and longs for her old life.The director of this one is Isao Takahata who directed the brilliant but harrowing The Grave of the Fireflies (1988) for Ghibli (so downbeat that it was the only Ghibli film to not be distributed by Disney). So, it was a bit of a left-of-centre offering from the famous Japanese studio, with Kaguya the material is more in line with what they are most famous for yet quite distinctive in several ways too. First off, as can almost be taken for granted, the animation really is quite beautiful and soulful. The style is definitely different though with a pastel watercolour palette and sketchy drawings. This style, however, suggests old paintings and suggests more effectively the ancient source of the material. The imagery is also complimented by an organic musical score that further underscores the aesthetic. As is the Ghibli genius though the story blends its surface fantasy with unmistakable reality, with important social issues interwoven into the flow. To this end we have the issues of women's place in society and the restrictions inherent in that considered in very clear ways. The story really captures this when five potential suitors for the princess are sent on impossible missions by her based on the superficial things they say to her in an attempt to claim her. It cleverly makes them consider the meaninglessness of their words and what their true motives are. So, it is quite a contemplative film on the whole and probably not very well suited to younger children who might find it unexciting. It's quite slow pacing and long run-time do make it one that is better suited to a slightly older audience perhaps. But if you can handle that it is a wonder in many places with a very emotional ending that is both sad and gorgeously delivered. Overall, this has to go down as yet another triumph for Studio Ghibli."
29,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,18 November 2016,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya:The original Japanese version.,"When taking a look at the films which had been nominated for viewing on IMDb's Film Festival board,this was the one that went right to the top of my most anticipated list.With Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke being my fifth favourite film of all time,I got set to meet another Ghibli princess. The plot:Chopping bamboo, Sanuki no Miyatsuko a bamboo shoot and finds a baby girl growing inside it! Believing her to be a miracle,Sanuki and his wife decide to raise the girl as their own.Giving her the name ""Princess"" the Miyatsuko's soon find their daughter to grow at an abnormal speed,as she develops a close friendship with Sutemaru,a fellow child in the village.Cutting bamboo one day, Miyatsuko cuts into bamboo shoots of gold. Taking this as a sign that their daughter really is a ""princess"",the parents tear her away from the village,and take her to live in a Palace. Christened with the name Princess Kaguya,Kaguya decides to give all of the men who want her hand in marriage impossible challenges,as Kaguya looks to her past in the nights sky. View on the film:Based on the 10th century Japanese folklore tale The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter,co-writer/(along with Riko Sakaguchi) director Isao Takahata paints the tale with exquisite water colours,giving the title a haunting atmosphere of being a fading memory. Taking the brave step of not filling every inch of the frame with a constant stream of action, Takahata expertly uses space to give the film an extraordinary poetic quality,with the royal ruby colours Kaguya is surrounded by being unable to replace the lush greens and blues of the flowers in Kaguya's former village. Currently the longest movie to come from Studio Ghibli,the screenplay by Takahata & Sakaguchi brilliantly use the time to meditate on the emotional bond Kaguya has to her childhood home,which sails off into a devastating, melancholy final,where Kaguya's parents find their daughter to grow away from them. Along with the heart-wrenching family Drama,the writers sparkle the title with a dose of Ghibli magic weaved in the attempts to get Kaguya's hand in marriage having the touch of tall tales from the lights of The Canterbury Tales and the fragmented encounters between Kaguya and Sutemaru leaping from an earthy bond into a pure,bittersweet flight of fantasy,as the bamboo shoots open up the tale of Princess Kaguya."
30,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,10 May 2016,Isao Takahata retires with one of the most beautiful pieces of art ever,"If Isao Takahata made more films he would most likely be my favorite director of all time. He was a co-founder of Studio Ghibli, a widely acclaimed Japanese animation studio, and also directed a few films for them. He is without a doubt my favorite animation director of all time, (sorry Don Hertzfeldt and Hayao Miyazaki, your both still great.) so when I found out that he was going to release a new film, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, the first one in nearly fifteen years, I could not be happier. And when I found out that it was going to be his last one, and supposedly the last one by studio Ghibli, (which turned out to be false with the the release of When Marnie Was There, a film that everyone needs to check out.) I could not be sadder. But when I, at long last, saw The Tale of the Princess Kaguya I was more than satisfied with it. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is based of a 10th century Japanese myth called the tale of the bamboo cutter. Which is actually the oldest known Japanese story, there's something very marvelous in making your last film an adaptation of your cultures oldest story. In the story a humble childless bamboo cutter, (Voiced in the American dub of the film by James Caan.) who lives out in the mountains, and spends his days cutting down the bamboo trees, and spending time with his wife. One day the bamboo cutter cuts down a bamboo tree and a mysterious light shines from inside the tree and the bamboo cutter finds a strange small girl in the tree. (Voiced by Chloe Grace Moretz.) The bamboo cutter then takes the girl home to his wife and they decide to raise it as their own. Supposedly The Tale of the Princess Kaguya was in production for eight years, and it shows. Not only is it the longest film Ghibli has ever produced, but every single frame in the film is absolutely awe-inspiring. I don't want to oversell the animation, but i think I can safely say that this might in fact be the best animation I've seen in any film ever up to this point. Don't get me wrong Spirited Away was immensely creative and detailed, and things like Akira and Fantasia were game changing, but there is a subtle and restrained beauty in The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, that I have never seen in any other film ever. Like all of the best animated films out there, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya creates its own world. And it's world is one of beautiful countrysides, crowded streets, empty lonely palaces, and most importantly whimsical magic. The animations subtle beauty does explode in some deeply emotional scenes, like in the flawlessly handled party scene, and the one immediately following it. The film's perfect animation is greatly enhanced by its soundtrack. The score for The Tale of the Princess Kaguya was composed by Joe Hisaishi, who composed most of the Ghibli's films, but even with his impressive back catalog The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is some of his best work. The song ""flying"" from the soundtrack is enough to bring me to tears, and when you combine the song with the actual scene in the film, man there really is nothing else like it. And the lyrics to the Nursery Rhyme are simply touching. Between the animation and the soundtrack I would say that the best way to describe The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is that the film just oozes beauty.The voice-acting is, well, on par with the soundtrack, animation and basically everything else in the film. Meaning it's beyond superb. Every single voice actor is at the top of their game. I should mention that I am talking about the English dub, the original Japanese dialogue is also great but I'm more familiar with the English dub, but in all honesty you can watch either and get the same effect. Typically when a film from a non-English speaking country gets released in an English speaking country, I would recommend watching the original dialogue, and to avoid any and all dubs, but that's not the case with Studio Ghibli. Disney owns the right to release Studio Ghibli films in America. So since they're Disney, when they release a Studio Ghibli film they get top quality actors to do the voices. And boy did they do a great job with The Tale of the Princess Kaguya. They're aren't many the big stars in The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, the biggest being Chloe Grace Moretz. But every single actor perfectly embodies they're character in a way that I've rarely seen done in animated film before this.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya was received well by critics, and was nominated for best animated feature by the academy awards in 2014, unfortunately it lost to Big Hero Six and while that's a decent film, the idea that Big Hero Six is anywhere near as good as The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is laughably and insultingly incorrect. The Tale of the Princess is one of the greatest animated films of all time, it's also one of the greatest films of the 2010s, if not they greatest for both of those categories. I really don't think I can recommend this film enough, everyone on this planet needs to see this film. It will never be possible for me, or anyone for that matter, to fully express this films beauty and quality in words, you just have to experience it for yourself. And please experience it as soon as possible.10/10"
31,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,17 May 2015,A beautiful story that transcends emotionally and spiritually.,"I have not watched many Japanese animation films. The only the other I have seen except this one is Spirited Away. But now I really consider watching them looking at the skills of the directors Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, etc. The tale of Princess Kaguya based on an old Japanese folktale is the story of a mysterious girl(named Kaguya later) who is discovered by a bamboo cutter in a bamboo stalk. He and his wife the raise baby girl as their own.Their house is situated in greenery of remote village in the mountains. Kaguya seems to grow very rapidly and becomes very close friends with gang of children in the neighborhood. Merrily singing and playing they enjoy the nature and Kaguya is having the most joyous time in her life. Her father though, envisions great things after he finds gold and fine clothes in other bamboo stalks. He thinks heaven wants Kaguya to become a princess and they need to raise her in that way. So off they go to the city and become a noble family with their gold. Kaguya who is initial happy with all the royal treatment soon understands the sorrows and bitterness in life when things are forced onto her. The story slightly loses its steam after the breezy first hour and I feel the run time could have been short by about 20 minutes. It dwells into complex themes of our world full of deceit and sorrow and the perceptions of cycles of life, afterlife hidden under its straight forward narrative. At times things get difficult to understand, still the visuals are so beautiful that you are completely engrossed into the scenery forgetting about the story. The ending which left me dazed was quite emotional and spiritually powerful. Despite some loose ends, the movie is overall well crafted with beautiful hand drawn animation and music. I felt it was emotionally moving and deeply profound. RATING: [4/5]"
32,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,13 May 2015,The Tale of Princess Kaguya  - Happiness is vanished (from Wing NG),"A few months ago, I went to the manuscript exhibition of Japanese animation ""Studio Ghibli"" in Hong Kong Heritage Museum. There were so many visitors. Everyone came here for Miyazaki Hayao, but I came for another director Isao Takahata. Miyazaki Hayao's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle are riddles for me forever, so I prefer the works of Isao Takahata relatively, easy to be understood but profound too.Farewell Firefly of Isao Takahata was criticized before: as the aggressive nation in the war, Japan was dressed as the victim of war in the film. Actually, Farewell Firefly is across the region to tell the destruction of human life and happiness by war, and this kind of destruction appears again in his new work The Tale of Princess Kaguya.The movie opens with the myth that the bamboo even gives birth to a beautiful girl, named ""Bamboo"", and she grows faster than normal people (therefore to meet the tragedy quicker?). The old man thinks she is a princess, so she was sent to the palace.The movie shots are very special that most of the backgrounds are static, however, the stationary scenery on the background is already very beautiful, and Bamboo in the foreground is lively; while since she leaves her hometown, her name is changed to Kaguya which means light shine. Then it is turn for Bamboo to become stationary, as she could not appear and move freely due to the ethics. Thereby her freedom is forbidden and happiness is vanished.The ending of the story is different from what I have heard - Bamboo returned to the hometown and found her lover had married and had a son. The movie has this scene, but it is just a dream of her lover, and Bamboo does not know his marriage in the dream too. On the contrary, the ending echoes the beginning, with a sense of myth. Bamboo cries to the moon, then the Buddha sends a messenger to pick her up. When she is put on feathers, all her memory losses, but she still takes a glance at the hometown at the end."
33,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,28 March 2015,The Princess Diaries,"Although I was chuffed when Big Hero 6 walked away with the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at this years' ceremony, my joy was short- lived when I realised I hadn't seen any other contender in the category. Yes, not even How to Train Your Dragon 2. One excuse was that The Tale of the Princess Kaguya hadn't been released in the UK yet, even though it had been floating around cinemas across the world for the past couple of years. Now released and featuring an English-dubbed cast consisting of Chloe Grace Moretz, James Caan, and Lucy Liu, it was time for redemption, and to watch what once slipped through my fingers. Or eyes. You know what I mean.Once upon time, in a galaxy far, far away, Mr Bamboo cutter, voiced by Sonny Corleone himself, James Caan, finds the tiniest of children hidden in a magical bamboo shoot and decides to take her under his, and his wife's, wing, raising her like their own and naming her Princess, due to her ability to grow at the speed of knots and develop much quicker than that of a mortal human. One day, Mr Bamboo cutter finds gold and cloth of fine quality in the same place he found his beloved Princess, and decides that she must be moved to the capital in order to fulfill her fate of nobility and become a real-life princess. First off, the film looks beautiful. In terms of effort and sheer elbow-grease the film must have required from the makers, it deserves a standing ovation, and I'm rather glad it got recognised by the Oscars, albeit losing out to the much more mainstream Big Hero 6. Each scene looks like it should be paused, printed out, and shoved in the Louvre for close examination. It is simply a wonder to behold. Now on to the story. Imagine the wonder of Pans Labyrinth. but set in the delicate world of a U rated movie; that's what came to mind during the course of Tale's simply glorious story that deals with all the key subjects of childhood, moving home, arranged marriage, and finally, fulfilling your destiny. The length of 137 minutes for an animated movie might be questionable, with the film suffering slightly during the half-way mark, but sticking with it results in one of the most heartbreaking, yet inevitable, endings of an animated movie you may ever see. In a nutshell? It's lovely.Overall Score: 8/10"
34,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,25 March 2015,Beautifully crafted epic,"Isao Takahata's The Tale of Princess Kaguya is a beautifully crafted epic. The animation, atypical of the style of Ghibli-style blockbuster we've come to expect and love in the UK, is delicate and beautiful. It is of no surprise that this melancholic triumph received an Oscar nomination for best animated film this year.Based on 10th Century Japanese folklore, it follows the life of a humble bamboo cutter who stumbles upon a glowing stalk, a tiny, hand-sized girl growing within. Returning home to his wife with excitement, the child rapidly transforms from baby, to toddler, to infant in a beautifully animated transition. Though the genuine film can be seen with subtitles, the dubbed version stars a formidable cast of Chloë Grace Moretz, Darren Criss, James Caan and Lucy Lui that compliments the animation impeccably. It's then down to personal preference as to which you'd rather experience.The tale beautifully and poignantly manifests itself as a parable-like journey, staying relatively true to its historical and mystical routes. The story follows the family as the bamboo cutter moves them to the city in order to fulfil Kaguya's destiny of becoming a princess. Though it is never clear as to how or why the father made the connection between his adoptive child and her future of royalty, the film rifles on and allows the little plot indiscretions to go largely unquestioned. The balance between humour and solemnity helps the narrative flow whilst making you feel real empathy for Kaguya and her situation. Whimsical moments deliver in captivating you entirely.The film also injects sorrow, particularly as the princess struggles with her new life away from the farm, friends and freedom she grew up with. And While her life moves on, the film develops upon these points before flowing lovingly into a situation in which the Princess sends five potential love interests on a mission to find for her an unobtainable gift. The new development, in which Kaguya finally embraces her power, is charming and brilliant! Animated entirely from the modern innovation of ink and watercolour, the definition in the penmanship drives the tone of the film. In moments of calm the pen marks curve delicately, whilst in times of trouble ink is sharp, aggressive and unfinished. The effect adds peace and rigour respectively, another layer to enhance the story. The Tale of Princess Kaguya is a welcome departure from this over-saturated CGI market that, whilst great in its own mediums, has detracted from the flare of ink based animation. Here Isao Takahata reminds us that it is still a daring art form that can craft glorious movies such as this.The entire film is held together exquisitely by another Joe Hisaishi masterclass. The stirring soundtrack adding beauty, elegance and hope to an already sublime film. The concluding piece of music is harrowing, yet delightful in the ultimate juxtaposition of image and sound. The score alone will have you scurrying home and downloading it just to hear it again.The Tale of Princess Kaguya is surprising and captivating, a true victory of imagination. With folklore at it's heart it airs on ridiculous, but remains grounded enough to thrill. The story is simple enough, but ends with a profound message.Originally written for: I'm With Geek"
35,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,18 March 2015,This is truly the best animation movie of 2014,"The tale of the Princess Kaguya brings in the Japanese tale about princess kaguya and her journey to find the meaning of happiness.Since this is Ghibli studio movie , it's for sure still amazing looking movie but even more stunning with it's Japanese painting style , and even that the movement of characters in the movie is still really good and some scene which character moving really fast it's just so amazing and so beautiful to watch.With that and Isao Takahata great storytelling just make this movie a really top list of animation movies.One thing that really make a lot of people angry is the ending of this movie which is not a surprise consider Isao Takahata famous movie like Grave of the Fireflies but honestly i personally really like the ending because it's just fit to the theme of this movie so much.and that theme is talking about finding the ""happiness"" but in the reality world it's not that easy and sometimes you just can't change everything especially the terrible fate that waiting for you and that what's The tale of the princess kaguya talks about.In the end this movie is truly the best animation movie of 2014 without any doubt in my mind , and maybe even the best movie of studio Ghibli."
36,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,24 February 2015,Deeply moving story,"Right off the bat, ""The Tale of the Princess Kaguya"" arrest you with its gorgeous animation; a watercolor storybook. But the movie's beauty lies also in its music, innocence and supernatural folktale. You're not ready for that one-two punch of love and sorrow in the third act. It's an emotional ending and the movie doesn't let any of this on until the very end when your defenses are down.Which isn't to say that the point of the movie is to tug at heartstrings It's an exquisite story about innocence, the prison of expectation and a sense of identity. Any sentimentality here comes about organically. It's just one of those things that sneaks up behind you and hits you where you live.8/10"
37,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,5,1 April 2015,Who put the moon out there? Why does the cow jump over it?,"I'm getting tired of these fantasy ridden movies that mirror a lot of ambiguity yet always talk about the same things. This is not of the same ilk as a Miyazaki film. It's not even a proper Japanese movie. It's an American movie, it's a Discworld movie, a Neil Gaiman fantasy novelization. It's a hippie movie disguised as a Ghibli picture. The major gripe I have about the whole affair is the way the story is derailed by the caprices of the magic which comes to mess up the kernel of heartfelt purity that had set off the movie.The birth of Kaguya is the best example of a supernatural act. It's familiar and unquestionable. Unlike later occurrences, you never doubt it's a dream sequence or a metaphor. The concept of miracle births have been drilled into us so soundly that we accept the childhood and disillusionment of Kaguya. What happens after the princes have failed in their quests is nothing but the admission (insert gratuitous box office joke) of the filmmakers that they have run out of imagination. This movie didn't make the splash it was no doubt vying to get and the anonymity that beckons will be very much deserved."
38,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,7,28 November 2013,Takahata's latest is beautiful but disappointing.,"I'm conflicted about folktales. What began as bits and pieces of oral literature, before someone had the good sense to put them to paper, are owed some amount of respect for being among the first stories that humans told. However, so many of the principles that we consider essential to the telling of a ""good story"" were developed  and are still developing  many generations after the birth of these yarns. Ancient storytellers didn't have the benefit of thousands of years of literature to lend them a detailed understanding of structure, character development, conflict, or how to make these elements compelling. I don't mean to be so hard on the awkward adolescence of modern literature, but folktales tend to be pretty bad stories. The process of adaptation can inject modern storytelling sensibilities into an otherwise crappy narrative, but in the case of the 2013 Studio Ghibli film KAGUYA-HIME NO MONOGATARI (The Story of Princess Kaguya) filmmaker Isao Takahata was unable to give this fable the contemporary touch it needs.KAGUYA-HIME NO MONOGATARI is based on the oldest known Japanese narrative, ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter,"" believed to be written in the 10th century. It tells the story of a poor man who finds a tiny girl in a stalk of bamboo. He takes the girl home to his wife, and they decide to raise her as their own and name her Kaguya. As she grows, Kaguya's otherworldly beauty becomes more apparent, and suitors begin to ask for her hand in marriage. She turns all of them down, rejecting the concept of marriage outright. At the end of the story, Kaguya must return to where she came from  the moon.As is clear from the premise of the tale and the opening scene of the movie when she is found, the titular character is not your average girl. Aside from her unusual discovery, we are first made aware of this in the scene where her adoptive father brings her home. She suddenly grows from a well-proportioned little person like Thumbelina or one of the Borrowers to something like a human infant. Considering that Takahata has always been the teller of more realistic stories compared Hayao Miyazaki (Studio Ghibli cofounder and legendary animator) and his flights of boundless imagination, this moment is one of the first instances in the movie that showcases Takahata's unique ability to blend the fantasy of this tale with the realism he is more experienced with crafting. It's so understated that it borders on unsettling.The first act of the movie is top-tier coming-of-age type stuff. The main character makes fast friends with some local boys and begins exploring the world around her home. Her father wishes to refer to her as hime, or ""princess,"" but her new pals dub her takenoko, or ""bamboo,"" to his chagrin. Her micro adventures cement one of the central themes within the film  the Buddhist ideal that a simple life is a good life. Once her father begins discovering piles of gold inside his bamboo harvests, it is only a matter of time before he whisks his little family away to an expensive palace where Takenoko will get the grooming she needs to become the princess the bamboo cutter intends for her to be. It is here that Takenoko  now referred to as Kaguya  begins to really develop as a character. At first, she openly basks in the luxuries of an affluent life but quickly begins to reject the expectations of one at her station  that is, etiquette, physical alterations, and eventually marriage.The story arc with the suitors is what I have the most problems with. They show up and boast all of the treasures they could lay at Kaguya's feet, but each boldly proclaims that Kaguya would be the most prized possession were she his. The princess rejects the notion of being objectified like a rare gemstone or precious metal and sends the suitors away. A few of them return later to prove their love through deception, but the young girl sees through their lies and sends them away once more, even refusing the proposal of the emperor of Japan. All of this is important to Kaguya's growth as a character. It proves that she is still the self-reliant tomboy she was as a poor bamboo cutter's daughter, despite all her pampering. The problem is that it lacks any of the understated magic that's so pervasive throughout the rest of the film and quickly begins to feel like a stuffy period piece instead of the fantastical folktale that it is. In a scene where the princess is doing something as uncomplicated as learning to play music, there is a mysticism surrounding her affinity for the instrument. All of this mystery and intrigue disappears as soon as these hopeful husbands show up. It bogs down the film to the point that by the time it's over, the audience has already been checking their watches for almost half an hour.To read the rest of this review, please visit: http://tinyurl.com/lylp5pz"
39,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,18 December 2017,Ghilbi does it again,"Even when the personification of all the gifts of nature are introduced in your life man's need for trivialities away from the true boon of this world that has been so adamant through the generations of patriarchal dominance leads you into places where you get trapped. Princess Kaguya keeps everyone happy around her yet there is a sadness throughout her journey where in which she slowly realises the trappings of the world even though it doesn't fully make sense. But it is this life that includes all the flaws of this world that give pain, grief, happiness, hope and make you able to live and feel to continue the cycle of life. The beautiful animation lets you dive into the folktale and live through a heartwarming experience."
40,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,19 November 2017,"""Tale of the Princess Kaguya""  Studio Ghibli again combines Irresistible Visual Artistry with powerful Storytelling","""The Tale of the Princess Kaguya"" sublimely beautiful film from the anime masters at Studio Ghibli (creators of previous indelible Artistry:  ""Spirited-Away"" ""Princess-Mononoke"" ""Grave of the Fireflies"")  Isao Takahata's unique-vision of ancient Legend ""Kaguya-Hime"" seems directly inspired by the ink-wash-brush painting/ calligraphy perfected in Japan during the 16th Century.  This animation style and visual palate seems authentically-Ancient as if master-illustrators from hundreds of years-past were magically transported to our present-time in order to share their spectacular artistry directly with us!  Of course the original story ""Kaguya-Hime"" dates back to 10th Century Japan aka ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter (or Taketori Monogatari)""  Focusing on a literal 'child emanating from the Stars' (more precisely originating from the Moon) arriving as a godsend blessing to a childless woodcutter and his wife, delicately enshrouded in a mere Bamboo stalk. The moon-child is initially free-spirited and deliriously-happy, growing faster and brighter by the Day!  However, the moon-child's exuberantly cheerful-carefree Lifestyle changes drastically, after her father discovers immense gold-treasure also within a stalk of bamboo..... with the irresistible combination of gold-treasure along with the moon-girl's growing beauty prompting the bamboo-cutter father to develop hugely ambitious dreams of taking his daughter to the Big-city to find a rich nobleman (and distinguished household) to marry her-off to.Once in the Big City, the bamboo-girl is given the auspicious name 'Kaguya' (perfectly describing the radiating-light emanating directly from her soul).  In addition, her undisputed irresistible beauty attracts legions of rich-nobleman suitors at beck & call.  But Kaguya is desperately unhappy and quite depressed, feeling akin to the proverbial songbird trapped in its gilded-cage.  There are moving scenes in which 'Kaguya' finds sympathy, solace and even joy in the act of 'releasing' other caged-trapped creatures (like birds, grasshoppers, etc.) The film proceeds to show Kaguya's potential suitors promising riches from the ends-of the-Earth in order to win her hand in marriage.....but Kaguya wistfully and truly longs for the type of genuine happiness only attainable thru authentic friendship plus freedom to live Life exactly as she herself chooses!  The Key to this Tale's powerful emotional resonance is the idea that even in her brief-time here on material-Earth the 'moon-child' Kaguya' forms authentic connections and deeply-indelible emotional-ties making Life truly worth living right here on pale-blue Earth, even though she originated from (and has been offered) the Moon & Stars.  There is an ineffable-beauty abundantly inherent to ""The Tale of Princess Kaguya"" in both story and Isao Takahata's visual-artistry."
41,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,,12 November 2017,Beautifully animated but perhaps a bit slow for its length (SPOILERS),"Based on a very famous story (which I have not heard before), Princess Kaguya is a beautifully animated piece which will speak to parents more than most casual viewers. The plot sees a simple woodcutter discovering a tiny princess inside a bamboo shoot, taking her home and, as she grows quickly, trying to ensure she has all the best things in life. To spoil the film for you early in my comments, this thread ends with her leaving to return to the moon, pursuing her own path in her life. There is a lot that goes on in the meantime, but this is the elements that kept me engaged  and perhaps because I am seeing the ""growing up and finding their own path"" journey first hand.This aspect is quite touching in how well played it is, however it is a simple aspect which isn't narrative per se. Instead the narrative moves slowly across changes in the life of Kaguya, suitors trying to win her hand, and the specifics of all of that. This is pretty engaging, but not as much as the critics would have you believe. The film does run long, and I'm not wholly convinced that it has the pace and content to sustain it. Like some others have mentioned, I did find my attention wavering a few times across the running time. This pace is helped by the style and animation, which creates a sense of patient beauty in how the film looks  so the opposite for example of the Batman Lego Movie, which feels like it is rushing you in and out of the movie from start to finish. Kaguya instead is beautifully animated in a way that seems so contrary to what can be done now with computer animation  where anything is possible, this focuses on creating beautiful frames with delicate strokes, and not having more than is necessary. As everyone says, it is a beautiful film in this way.The voicework in the English version maybe follows this too closely, and there is a certain 'downplayed' feel to the delivery from most of the cast. I think it all still works, and the famous names do generally hit their marks and deliver well  but I can understand the comments from others who say the cast occasionally sound bored, or subdued in their delivery; I took it as them matching the tone of the film and was fine with it.In the end, the animation is beautiful and it creates an engaging tone and pace for the film, even if I did think the content was not strong enough for the long running time and the slower pace. At heart though, the story of parents seeing their child grow was the element that stuck with me, and made it a mostly rewarding film, even if it is the animation that stands out above everything else."
42,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,19 March 2017,A gorgeous complex tale,"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is based on the Japanese folk tale The Daughter of the Bamboo Cutter, a tale that has been transmitted since the 16th century. This is one of those films that you don't imagine being made by anybody who is not Ghibli related. The tale could have been turned into a simplistic story for dumb kids with showy 3G visuals and little substance. However, Ghibli and Takhata created an animated piece that is both beautiful to look at, but also a complex multi-layered story with archetypal mythical characters, both delightful to watch and true to the myth. The childhood part is really wonderful, and we delight at seeing Kagugya discovering the world and growing up as a happy child, really cute, tender and fun; therefore, this part is basically experiential. The second part is, on the contrary, very reflective; it portrays old traditional ways of living and societal structure in Japan with easiness and fun, but it is also the tale of Kaguya's increasing sadness and unhappiness. The Tale of Princess Kaguya is related to the Buddhist Bon Festival, which is celebrated on a full moon on the 15th August (this is a hint!). Like any myth, the story is a compendium of human wisdom, an exploration of the human feelings, a depiction of human archetypes, and teaches many lessons. Some of the themes presented in the film are really philosophical and mythological and would require of page after page of analysis: from the creation myth, to the suitors tests, to the complex religious symbolism of the Buddhist ending. Just the analogy of the bamboo plant natural progression, and Kaguya being called Li'l Bamboo is an indication of what we can expect (another hint!). Some of the lessons that this old tale is embedded with are very relevant to our modern fast-paced 21st century: > Money and status don't equal happiness. > You cannot, should not, must not impose your ideal of happiness onto your offspring; that it is emotional castration. > We have an obligation with ourselves to let our voice be heard and our heart be seen, no matter the circumstances. > We all have to follow our own path, despite any family or societal pressure. It is our life, after all. > Life is a fleeting moment, and we should live it to the fullest. Seek joy, cultivate ways of living and emotional statuses that are soulful to you. > Love is not about conquest, is not about trials and games, is not about an ideal of love, the perfect partner. It is about what you feel in your heart and how things flow with another person even if that person is not your ideal. > Parental love is not just about discipline and rules, is also about letting our children find their own voice and way in the world. > When we die, all vanishes, no memory is left, even if you are a Buddhist and believe in reincarnation. However, there is a longing in our soul to improve next time we came down, if that ever happens, to try again, to have a second, third or fourth chance to be happy, to enjoy life and get what life is all about. > Happiness is not in the outside world, it is how you feel about the outside world. One of the most puzzling things in the film is that Kaguya is not a princess in the Disney sense or in the traditional European sense. Certainly, she has a legendary beauty, she is loving and lovable, and she has many suitors who have to do things to get her love. Yet, Kaguya is not perfect, she is a confused human being, and the story doesn't have a perfect ending either. Actually, Kaguya is truly imperfect, is the anti-heroine, she is a mortal human being, she has regrets, but she is never fake or accepts the system. Her only betrayal she commits is that of not letting her voice being heard at the right time and allowing herself to be engulfed by everything and everybody that surrounds her. More and more, I feel that 2D animation is really modern, artistic and versatile, and that is far from being replaced by 3G. This film is beautifully artistically drawn and lightened, with a very soft palette of gorgeous colors, and an intentional use of the background for narrative purposes. For example, life in the city is shown mostly through images of people, the backgrounds are basic and barely there, not much action, there is some sort of passivity and slow motion. On the contrary, the childhood period in the countryside and the trips of Kaguya to her native town are the opposite, and have very detailed backgrounds and images, rich colors, full of animals and little creatures and plants, and most of what happens there is movement. And that is, after all, the way Kaguya perceives the world. The only two downsides I see in the movie are, firstly, that it is unnecessarily long and, secondly the quite dramatic differences in the mood of the first and second part of the tale and there is not transition.I watched the movie in Japanese with English subtitles, and it was delightful."
43,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,7,27 January 2017,A wistful and reflective work from Studio Ghibli,"THE TALE OF THE PRINCESS KAGUYA is a wide-reaching Studio Ghibli epic done in a slow, thoughtful, and evocative way. The story is based on the same bit of Japanese folklore that was behind the 1980s film PRINCESS FROM THE MOON, starring Toshiro Mifune. The movie was directed by Isao Takahata, who previously made MY NEIGHBOURS THE YAMADAS back in the 1990s, and it has the same basic, old-fashioned animated look to it, albeit with more colour and time spent on the imagery.For those looking for an action-packed Disney-style romp with dumb comedy, go elsewhere. Like a lot of Ghibli products, KAGUYA is a mature and reflective piece of work, more of a mood piece than anything else. The fantasy story is tinged with warmth but also sadness and tragedy; a classic coming-of-age tale with something of a depressing outcome. It might even be Ghibli's most adult film to date and it certainly connects with the viewer more than anything like THE WIND RISES; I'll freely admit to the tears running down my cheeks during a wistful song at the climax. My only complaint is that it's a little long, but that doesn't detract from the experience."
44,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,31 December 2016,Brilliant and powerful,"This is an excellent movie for all ages. As an 8-year old, I loved it. It combines humour and sadness in a magically effective way. The narrative is beautiful, the imagery very rich. The music is delightful. The characters are convincing in their roles and their personalities are well developed. The plot/idea is brilliant, really imaginative. The landscapes are gorgeous and the film is visually enticing. The scenes are invariably powerful. Princess Kaguya, the heroine in the story has a lot of courage and determination to do this part. I also liked other characters: they were interesting, deep, and some of them were very funny. The movie makes you laugh, think, reflect, and sometimes even cry. There is a lot of emotion and compassion in the story. In summary, everything about this movie was simply perfect and I hope all children in the world could see it---it's marvelous! This is one of the best movies I've seen. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone."
45,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,,19 November 2016,Let Her Be,"Based on a traditional Japanese folktale, this Studio Ghibli presentation revolves around a child found inside a bamboo stalk whose adoptive parents raise her as a princess, contrary to what her heart desires. There are some gaps in the narrative, but this remains a film that works on several levels. It is partially about a childless couple having the chance to realise their dream, but then it is also a tale of them coming to realise that they cannot dictate their daughter's happiness; i.e. it is about parents realising the importance of letting their children go. It is also a story of female empowerment with the title character giving her five suitors impossible quests to win her heart, since she does not wish to be owned by anyone. Furthermore, her empowerment tale is tinged with regret as she learns the unfortunate fates of her suitors, each one disadvantaged by attempting to complete her quests. Promising as this may sound, the film ends on a low note as things turn sentimental towards the end. Several narrative elements do add up either (the parents having the wealth to move to the city; the suitors all returning within a week of each other after a three-year hiatus), however, the quality of the animation constantly pushes the film through. The hand-drawn frames are incredibly effective, with a particular well done sequence in which she goes for a nighttime run and all the lines around her blur surreally together. The music is expectedly good too. If a far cry from director Isao Takahata's 'Grave of the Fireflies', this effort still offers an interesting, often touching story."
46,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,17 September 2016,Animation and storytelling at its very best in this encaptivating heart-breaking story.,"Studio Ghibli who have created the wonderful acclaimed artworks of Spirited Away, Ponyo, and the recent When Marnie was There put together a most stunning and heart melting animated feature of life, freedom, and the spiritual realms. With a brilliant direction talent by Isao Takahata, beautiful and soothing score by Joe Hisaishi Princess Kaguya is absolutely fantastic and mesmerising artistry come to life.The tale focuses on the life of the miraculous Princess (or Little Bamboo known by her friends) who mysterious appears from a bamboo tree and finds a family when discovered by a local bamboo cutter who believes the young miracle is sent form the heavens and to be treated as royalty. Growing 5x faster than other children, Princess soon is coaxed by her farther to leave her home and friends to move into a glamorous life style away form the nature filled environment she loves so dear. From here she becomes obliged to learn the ways of a real Princess, but struggles to do her duty and becoming free to be her own woman.Although originally voiced by a cast of Japanese actors in 2013, I had the privilege to watch the American voiced version released in 2014, as I listened to the satisfying sound of Chloë Grace Moretz and a wonderful supporting cast of voices even the great James Caan, and Lucy Liu.What inspires the whole film is the fascinating character of Princess Kaguya who discovers a new perspective for life that finds beauty and poetry in everything that surrounds her and defies the stereotypical life of traditional Japanese Royal life. This also explores the compelling spiritual worlds and their relationship between the human world.But what captures the pure essence and story of the film is the animated masterpiece of visually captivating landscape poetry and fabulous colour that brings the story alive and intro your heart. Such an amazing piece of work does so much to your mind and heart and will leave you with tears erupting from your eyes.A brilliant and must see powerful animated piece of art. 9.3/10"
47,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,7 February 2016,"Beautiful, heart-wrenching and powerful- but some slow moments.","The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is a 2013 Japanese anime fantasy/drama film directed by Isao Takahata and part of the infamous collection of Studio Ghibli films, other known ones being Grave of the Fireflies, Spirited Away and My Neighbour Totoro. To my delight, Studio Ghibli has done it once again and produced another fantastic movie. One that delivers a beautiful, emotional narrative about a bamboo cutter who discovers a tiny princess growing from one of the shoots, who then grows up to become royalty only to feel misplaced, without an sense of identity and at times feels isolated. One that delivers blissful, traditional sounding Japanese folk scores and a very unique, water-coloured based animation style, hand crafted to perfection. The film focuses primarily on the princess and her short but memorable life on Earth. The tale features many different themes that keep the story diverse and engaging, and the ending provides a prefect sense of closure while being hugely powerful and heart- wrenching. The film is also very mature and provides all round entertainment for people of all ages-not just young children. The film does have a few flaws however that just slightly hold it back from being a 'perfect 10', the first being its length at 2hrs 17mins certain parts certainly felt dragged out, especially when arriving in the capital during the second act and some extremely slow paced scenes that aren't hugely interesting or gripping. These however barely take from the experience of this beautiful film and proving once again Studio Ghibli are the masters of anime and a huge influence on animation films in general. 8/10"
48,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,21 January 2016,Really good!,"Y'know this movie reminds me of ""Benjamin Button"" as we see Princess Kaguya grown from a baby to an adult pretty quickly like a hamster with its heart beat always faster. I was surprised to have seen a nipple allowed in this because in other Studio Ghibli, the cartoon females breast is either hidden or censored out. Ah well, I suppose they have to be different with other films too!I wouldn't be a fan of the anime drawing, it looks too sketchy and some of the characters eyes didn't appear to look straight at the other characters. The only best drawing of the figures were Princess Kaguya and Sutemaru. I would suggest that the other rest of the characters would be redrawn since they didn't look like the proper anime figures you would normally at all. It might be even better to copy the other anime films and not make the whole movie look either sketchy and bright throughout!I was honestly so sad at the ending. I was bummed that Princess Kaguya left her adoptive parents behind but pretty much she left everybody behind! I honestly was disappointed that she made that choice and didn't intend to marry Sutemaru, they would've been a great couple.Even though I don't consider one of the best movies that Studio Ghibli, it was rather enjoyable but bring your tissues out before the end!"
49,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,7,11 February 2015,Bizarrely interesting but a bit overrated.,"'THE TALE OF THE PRINCESS KAGUYA': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A Japanese animated fantasy film from writer/director Isao Takahata. Takahata directed and co-wrote the movie (with Riko Sakaguchi), which is based on the Japanese folktale 'The Tale of The Bamboo Cutter'. It tells the story of a magical princess; who was found inside a glowing bamboo plant, when she was a baby, by a bamboo cutter who then raised her. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics and it was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film, at the upcoming 87th Academy Awards. I found it to be bizarrely interesting but a bit overrated (like most films of it's genre).The film begins with a bamboo cutter, named Sanuki no Miyatsuko (voiced by Takeo Chii), finding a small baby girl; inside a glowing bamboo shoot. Believing her to be a magical gift from God, Sanuki takes her home and raises her as his own; with his wife Ona (Nobuko Miyamoto). She grows very quickly and the couple names her Kaguya (Aki Asakura). They raise her to be a princess and move her to the capital. There she is greatly admired, for her beauty, and sought after by multiple wealthy men. Kaguya is not impressed by any of her possible suitors though, and she challenges them all to bring her a really rare gift.The movie is the type of animated film I would have liked a lot more as a kid. It's well made, and an interesting story, but it's also way too long and overly melodramatic. This is typical of many animated films though; especially ones made in Japan. Fans of the genre, and especially the director, will love it though. I found it to be just a little too dry and boring.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chY2PeSnCng"
50,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,,9 December 2014,Anime at its best!,"""Being a princess isn't all it's cracked up to be."" Princess Diana Who would have thought bamboo could produce such a delicate beauty as a princess (voice of Chloe Grace Moretz)? In the hands of the Japanese Studio Ghibli, director Isao Takahata has crafted a rival story of his colleague in that same studio, Hayao Miyazaki (The Wind Rises). The 10th-century tale of a princess found in a bamboo shoot carries enough contemporary relevance to keep grad students in theses for a decade.This lovely and exciting Japanese anime sports the usual and still beautiful charcoalwatercolor motif (you'll want to linger with the plum blossoms) accompanied by Joe Hisaishi's fitting pastoral, woodland music. The surprisingly simple theme--like Dorothy and ET, she needs to get home--has multiple strains of narrative, not the least of which shows a loving adoptive mother and father (Mary Steenburgen and James Caan), who try to give her everything a princess could want only to fail to give her a most important treasure, her friends and relatives in her far away home.The lack of maudlin longing and her affection for her adoptive home make this unusual storytelling because it does not pander to the expectations of the audience. When the princess abjures the stylistic and cosmetic changes to make her look like a princess (her dad has, after all, bought her into royalty and she needs to look like one), she evidences the rebellious attitude of teens everywhere and anytime.Although violence could have been a legitimate element of this story, there is none; although a sappy romance with a handsome prince could have been warranted, there is none; although Kaguya could have been too sweet, she is not. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is a beautifully told story in the best Japanese tradition.""My mom won't let anyone treat me like a little princess."" Chloe Grace Moretz"
51,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,24 February 2015,Best animated film ever made?,"When I think of animated films, my mind is not filled with enchanting scenes from Fantasia or talking toys or many of the other things that seem to be so exhilarating to mass audiences. Popularity and entertainment have grown less exciting to me the more that I watch movies. I want to be caressed with a beautiful idea and allowed to ponder it for a while. That's why I love Studio Ghibli. Or, that's at least one reason why I love Ghibli.Other contenders for best animated film might be... Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Grave of the Fireflies, Princess Mononoke, or the beautiful ""recobbled cut"" of The Princess and the Cobbler. I think that The Tale of Princess Kaguya is easily a contender. Not for greatest of 2014 (WHY Big Hero 6?) but of all time.Animation-wise, it is near the very top. It is every bit as entrancing as Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. Of course, Princess Mononoke has more detail in its art and The Princess and the Cobbler is in a class of its own. (If you've never seen The Princess and the Cobbler - Recobbled Cut on YouTube, watch it now - its Salvador Dali meets Andy Warhol). The animation is minimalistic to the point that it actually enhances and adds to the experience. Your mind is allowed to fill in the blanks. The ""suggestions"" made by the animators are absolutely breathtaking. The spirit of Japan comes to life in their strokes.Considering the animated films that are being released today (Walt Disney Studios, for example, treats its audience like mindless garbage receptacles), Princess Kaguya is more than a breath-of-fresh-air, it is a very important film. It says something that very few movie studios have the guts to say. That money doesn't matter - life should be pure. That's what this movie pines for - purity. And how so lacking are America's studios today! Hollywood has become a business rather than a laboratory. It no longer makes films; instead, we are subjected to 2- hour-long trailers for merchandise. Kaguya is a real masterpiece and work-of-art. It deserves to be celebrated. And it deserved the Oscar. Maybe it's too good for the Oscars."
52,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,10 February 2015,"Breathtaking, enchanting, imaginative and beautiful - best animated film of  the year","The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is a breathtaking folktale brought to life with charm and finesse, and is, in short, an animated masterpiece.As a movie watcher, I might be the most unbiased and least qualified to review The Tale of the Princess Kaguya. I know nothing of Studio Ghibli nor do I know anything about the film's writer and director Isao Takahata. Apparently both are juggernauts of animation and prolific artists in the medium of film. Without any knowledge of either I must solely look at the film for how it resonates with me, and in short: it is a beauty.A bamboo farmer is harvesting his stalks when he comes across a tiny girl inside a lotus blossom within a severed bamboo stalk. He takes the little girl to his wife, who is childless, and they decide to care for the girl. Before they know it, the girl has transformed into a baby and rapidly grows into a striking young lady. Her father decides it must be the bamboo girl's fate to be a princess, which she fervently resists while simultaneously respecting his wishes. The poised and mysterious princess attracts much attention and enchants all those who hear of her. In the end, only she knows of her ultimate fate and in facing it, she faces her true being.Unfortunately I found it extremely difficult to find the subtitled original Japanese language version of The Tale of the Princess Kaguya and could only watch the English dubbed version, though let it be known I always much prefer to watch a film in its original language. Luckily, production was able to get veteran actors for the English voiced version of The Tale of the Princess Kaguya so the film is able to stand on its own in English as well as Japanese.Though aspects of the narrative within The Tale of the Princess of Kaguya are conventional, since its plot derives from an old Japanese folktale, the story is fantastical, emotional and enchanting and the antithesis of stale. The themes presented in the story are imaginative and engaging and the animation is complementary to the style.I had long forgotten the days when animation was a medium to facilitate imagination, creativity and artistry  and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya revitalizes the medium for American viewers in a wonderful and masterful way.Please check out our WEBSITE for full REVIEWS of all the recent releases and awards nominees."
53,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,24 January 2015,beautiful but not for everyone,"Since Miyazaki has retired, it's been interesting to see who is going to take the lead in making quality animated films at Studio Ghibli, and it looks like Isao Takahata is that person. I thought his new film The Tale of the Princess Kaguya was quite beautiful and I like that the story is based on an ancient Japanese folktale since folktales make for great animation (see Disney). However, I don't think it has the same global appeal as Miyazaki's films as it was somewhat hard to sit through. I watched the English language version, and I think this was part of the problem as I have a feeling the translation wasn't as accurate as those on Miyazaki's films."
54,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,14 December 2014,Exceeds Studio Ghibli's prestigious reputation,"I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I saw the trailer a year or so ago. Does it live to up to expectations? Yes it does. I fell in love with this movie. It's filled to the brim with exquisite beauty and a unique art style that I've never seen before. Now this isn't a movie for everyone and I completely understand if you don't like it. Average moviegoers might be a little turned off, as not much happens, but if you're a Ghibli fan, you'll have no complaints. The music is beautiful and calming and I've had it stuck in my head all day. As I mentioned before, not much happens in this movie, but it isn't really a bad thing, because the whole point of the movie is get a point across, that point being life is filled life both happiness and grief, but stay strong during the hard parts. You don't need much to happen to get that across. It takes its' time and lets you sink it all in. This is probably the second best movie I've seen all year (Boyhood beats it slightly, but it beats Interstellar, Guardians of the Galaxy, and X-Men: Days of Future Past) and I'm telling you to seek this film out. You'll get your money's worth."
55,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,1 December 2015,"Absolutely beautiful film about magic, good intentions and finding your place in things","This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Feature, losing to Big Hero 6. There will be spoilers ahead: I'm not going to talk much about the plot, because this film must be seen to be appreciated. So I'll do a quick synopsis first and then talk about the technical aspects.A bamboo cutter finds a small girl in a bamboo stalk and takes her home as a blessing from the gods. She becomes a regular sized baby and then proceeds to rapidly grow into a beautiful woman. She's taken to the city as a young girl to be raised as a princess Through much tumult, she finally learns her place in things and who she really is.It really is a very interesting story, with fascinating characters-all of which should unfold for you as you watch the film. This is not only one of the best animated films I've seen, but also one of the better films I've seen in some time.The hand-drawn animation is beautiful, the music is wonderful and matches the film perfectly. The editing is very good and the voice work (at least on the Japanese language soundtrack) was exceptional. The script was also excellent.Although I like Big Hero 6 and consider it also a very good film in its own right, I personally like The Tale of Princess Kaguya even more and I wish it had won the Academy Award instead. I know it really doesn't matter. Both are excellent films and are deserving of the accolades they've received.This film is available on Blu Ray and DVD. By all means, watch it on Blu Ray if you can. Most highly recommended."
56,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,,6 August 2015,Isao Takahata's best work,"Isao Takahata has always been a so-so director in my opinion. Grave of the Fireflies remained his grand achievement throughout his whole career and his other films have been rather hard to sell to non-Japanese audiences because of their heavy reliance on Japanese culture, tradition and most especially humour. Which is why I was so pleasantly surprised by this film, which in my mind easily takes place as his new magnum opus.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya faithfully retells a classic Japanese folktale about a princess, send from the heavens, who is found by a humble bamboo cutter from within a bamboo stalk. Said bamboo cutter is given gold, cloth and everything else he needs to raise the princess as his own and to give her the kind of life she deserves. The films doesn't really deviate from the tale, but that shouldn't count against it, especially because any non-Japanese viewer is unlikely to know the tale intimately.Plus, it's a really well-told tale, smoothly flowing from one scene to another, from the early days in a small cabin to grand feasts and noble suitors. Aki Asakura, the voice actor of Kaguya-hime, gives her a really likable personality and the film excels in showing both the humanity and otherworldly grace of the character.I also really like the animation style, which mimics the drawings that were used to illustrate the tale in the ancient times. It's simplistic yet beautiful most of the time, but can be very expressive when the scene calls for it. There are also couple segments which utilize a more experimental, almost abstract style, and they are easily the best parts of the film aesthetically.As a whole The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is an amazing experience. The story is universal enough to be appreciated by any viewer, yet it remains intimately Japanese at its roots. The animation style is beautiful in its bleakness, the characters are enjoyable and as a whole the film is one of the finest Studio Ghibli has ever released. Definitely worth a watch."
57,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,7,19 April 2015,"Again, Studio Ghibli offers us a powerful story.","""Kaguyahime no monogatari"" (AKA ""The Tale of the Princess Kaguya""), written by Isao Takahata and Riko Sakaguchi, directed by Isao Takahata. Again, Studio Ghibli offers us a powerful story. The social struggle facing all and everything to create a balance between formal and informal - that state of sincerity and spontaneity of individuals who are often unframed by the world where they live in. A princess is always a girl. Looking back to Ghibli's latest films We can notice a completely different investment in the graphic line but also in what we can call ""epicness"". Well, all winds change, they must adapt to the surroundings and this amazing Studio is not different from the others - Hayao Miyazaki was a big and solid mountain but everything must evolve (he did too, in his latest films). Yet, despite all blows, the power of their stories stay compelling and competitive!"
58,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,1 March 2015,A fitting finale for Studio Ghibli's Isao Takahata,"I like Japanese folk tales because of their simplicity and unique wisdom. It also gives me the opportunity to imagine impressive landscapes in rural and premodern Japan. 'The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter' is one of those really old folk tales, which dates back in the 10th century. So even before watching Takahata's 'The Tale of The Princess Kaguya', I think I will most probably like the film too because it was adapted from a folk tale. Well, it turned out to be one of the artistically unusual animated films that I have ever seen.First impression was it felt like an old Japanese painting that came to life, but then later on, it felt like a dream rather than a painting. It was that good, and it mainly succeeds as a cultural film. This is a must-see for animation and Japanese folk tale enthusiasts.Most of the time, the pacing was at cruise speed, which allowed the environment to breath. We see beautiful landscapes done in watercolor and simple strokes, and generally, they looked more like an artist's sketch in a good way. These were accompanied by the relaxing sounds of nature, and the outcome has effectively immersed the viewer into its dreamy scenes. The experience was made even better because of its notable music. Combine these with its topnotch voice talent (Japanese version) and well-written dialogue arguably results to one of the most remarkable films in the animation genre.Although the theme is rather familiar, the film has given not just a good story to tell but a memorable experience. It is mainly about the search for happiness, and it has allusions to religious teachings about the person's earthly life, where there are sufferings and impurities, and the afterlife in heaven, where there are only peace and happiness. In fact if this theme is told in a motion picture, the result will most probably be just so-so. In this way, the film has achieved a remarkable feat and has ended it memorably with delightful tunes and scenes that elicit reflection on our life in this world. There was a certain facet, where the film didn't quite hit its target though. This was during the scenes where the emotions should have been powerful, but since you don't really have a good clue on what the character was talking about, these scenes rather felt a little bit awkward. Perhaps, the other world, where the princess came from, was not developed well at that point. This issue is easy to set aside though because the overall viewing experience has been great already. As a person who have some inclination towards instrumental music, it was not hard to notice the impressive music that Joe Hisaishi has composed in this film. This is arguably one of his best works among the Studio Ghibli films that I have seen. In the case of Isao Takahata's directing achievement, this is comparable to his solid work in the 'Grave of the Fireflies'; perhaps even matched it. Nonetheless, this film is indeed a fitting finale for his career in the animation industry, and this is one of the films that he will be remembered best."
59,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,19 March 2015,Beauty that doesn't need to be analyzed,"I am a long-term fan of the Studio Ghibli animation films. So of course when i learned that they made a new one, i was instantly interested. The expectations were sort of mixed since it was the first film after Hayao Miyazaki's retirement, and nobody could really tell what Studio Ghibli can come up with now.But when you actually start watching The Tale of The Princess Kaguya, all these politics and worries immediately dissipate. This film is SO visually different from what Hayao Miyazaki made, yet there's the same delicate touch and emotionality flowing from every second of it. It is like the paintings came to life to tell us a story. The story beautiful as life itself. In a way, it can be viewed as a parable about life, nature and humanity's futile attempts to ensnare it for its own vain entertainment.But, honestly, no analysis does The Tale of The Princess Kaguya any good. Some things are better if left as they are, for us to simply contemplate their beauty without trying to touch it or make it our own. And this is exactly the reason why it's pointless to dissect this movie into details and describe them here. Simply watch it, and you will be spiritually rewarded."
60,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,21 February 2015,simple fable turns into more,"An old bamboo cutter finds a tiny princess growing out of a bamboo stalk in the forest. He assumes she's a blessing from heaven. When his wife takes her, she turns into a baby girl. They raise her as their own. She grows quickly like bamboo with magic. The village boys befriend her especially Sutemaru. A bamboo produces fine cloth and gold for the old cutter. He takes his family to the capitol city presenting her as a princess. He becomes obsessed with social climbing. She's a rambunctious girl who rebels against her teacher's attempt to train her. She runs back to the village to find Sutemaru's family gone.It's an interesting fable and the simple drawing style gives an impression of a children's fantasy. It turns into something much more. It's a young girl trying to grow up struggling against the world of conventions, materialism and the class divide. It's a lesson in real beauty. The drawings are beautiful and such a compelling story."
61,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,17 February 2015,"An Animated Masterpiece, Reinvents the Term Simplistic Beauty","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.7/5 starsBoasting narrative depth, unbridled candor, and exquisite visual beauty, ""The Tale of the Princess Kaguya"" is a modern animated treasure with timeless appeal. Legendary Studio Ghibli cofounder Isao Takahata (""Grave of the Fireflies"", ""Pom Poko"") revisits Japan's most famous folktale in this gorgeous, hand-drawn masterwork, decades in the making. One day, an old bamboo cutter finds a princess side a shining stalk of bamboo. Along with his wife, he decides to raise the princess, who's only the size of a finger, but soon grows into an exquisite young lady. When Kaguya grows up, 5 men from prestigious families propose to her. Kaguya asks the men to find memorable marriage gifts for her, but they are unable to do so. Then, the Emperor of Japan himself proposes to her. The mysterious young princess enthralls all who encounter her, but ultimately she must confront her fate.From the studio that brought you ""Spirited Away"" (2001), ""Princess Mononoke"" (1997), ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"" (1984), and numerous other animated classics comes a powerful and sweeping epic that redefines the limits of animated storytelling while marking a triumphant highpoint within an extraordinary career in filmmaking for director Isao Takahata. The Japanese have long been revered as masters of animation, and ""The Tale of the Princess Kaguya"" is a fitting farewell for one of the genre's greats.With its sumptuous images and impressionistic storytelling, the film is nothing short of a delicate, stirring fable - both joyous and melancholic. The animation notwithstanding, what makes ""Princess Kaguya"" stick in emotional terms is its depiction of an extraordinary girl, learning for herself that a life without real joy and spontaneity is only a shadow of a life. A charmingly sad story is sweetly told through breathtaking, hand-drawn sketches to give us a sweeping epic that's lyrical and heartbreaking in ways which most live-action movies can only aspire to. If there's a message here about the foolhardiness of parental expectations and societal conformations, it fades away in the face of the film's rapturous visuals.The fact that this film is animated using nothing more than a pen, pencil, brush, and watercolors shows that even today 2D done right brings more depth and visual appeal to a story than all the advanced CGI, 3D, razmattaz effects thrown together. Takahata and his team of animators meticulously craft each scene with hand-drawn sketches and mesmerizing textures that perfectly complements the themes of the whimsical story. ""Princess Kaguya"" boasts one hauntingly beautiful sight after another, seemingly built on nothing more than slight sketches and quick brushstrokes - something Hollywood movie moguls could learn from if they'd ever seek a way out of the exorbitant costs invested in their tech-savvy animated films.Featuring a heart-tugging story with characters that stay with you, and showcasing some the most gorgeous artwork in Japan's rich anime history, ""The Tale of the Princess Kaguya"" is a spellbinding spectacle that easily takes its position as one of Ghilbi's best works."
62,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,12 February 2015,Great beauty in simplistic animation that matches the story mood,"The movie very nicely reinvented the dramatization of one of the most famous Japanese traditional folklore. It nicely creates focus points on the story and made the movie's two hour duration all worthwhile. All the technicalities supported this movie very nicely. The mood of the story is critically emphasized by the whole drawing and coloration style. The whole, semi sketch draw style gives the authentic folklore feel, in conjunction with the main song of the movie. I really like the color palette choice of pastel and light shade colors. Although it gets to be very bright most often, especially when you're viewing the movie in a dark room from a monitor, the light shades always bring the original folklore spirit back on and reduces the mystery aura many times. The coloration that seem like it's unfinished coloring, with uncolored spaces between the sketch lines instead makes this movie look very beautiful in my eyes."
63,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,6 January 2015,"Blows all other ""princess"" movies out of the water","I was excited to see Kaguya-hime during a trip to Japan, on its release date in 2013, with only beginner-level Japanese. The visual story is told so masterfully that I didn't feel that I gained much more insight after re-watching with subtitles. Length is not an issue here - Takahata takes time to complete the narrative, and for a good reason. The leisurely pace mesmerizes the viewer and allows investment in the characters. By the final moments, which unfold to an ethereal, psychedelic melody, there's not a dry eye in the house. The audience wept audibly both in Japan and U.S. screenings. Considering the similar effect of ""Grave of the Fireflies"", Takahata may be an even greater emotional manipulator than Spielberg, but a far less maudlin one. Although the film deals with universal themes that could easily turn into clichés (parenting, social mobility, death, etc.), in the hands of this director they invite profound contemplation.The animated images are among Ghibli's most beautiful - they seem to be equally inspired by 12th-century Genji scrolls and modernist Rimpa-school nature paintings. One amazing scene, of Kaguya's brief ""rebellion"", is downright expressionistic. It's probably my favorite animation sequence of all time."
64,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,4 January 2015,"A rare gem of modern animation, a masterpiece no doubt.","Before this film, the last masterpiece by Takahata Isao at Studio Ghili is My Neighbors the Yamadas (1999). 7 years later, in 2006, he began a new animation project which is this film, and everyone had to wait another 7 years to see his work which was claimed prior to the release date by Nishimura Yoshiaki (a producer of the film) that this work is ""the best and last"" by Takahata. I completely agree with Mr. Nishimura. The film has a minimalist style taking some resemblance to My Neighbors Yamadas, but more colorful, more poetic and picturesque, and more artistically soaring in visual style. The plot is simple and beautiful. The soundtrack is awesome.In his career at Ghibli, Takahata has made just 5 animated feature films for 25 years (including Grave of the Fireflies), roughly a half as much as Miyazaki Hayao's works (9 films), but as the more time went by, the better and the more creative Takahata has been in making his works. And with Kaguya, he has reached his highest peak in the life of creation. In my own opinion, this film is as excellent as Miyazaki's Spirited Away in general: less symbolic but way visually better than Miyazaki's work.And like Grave of the Fireflies or Only Yesterday, Kaguya's ending leaves some melancholy in audiences' mind, though it is so predictable. Perhaps it's the melancholy not only about the film, but also about a rare gem in animation which has gone far far away and would never come back, like Kaguya."
65,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,29 December 2014,Better than The Wind Rises,"Finally! It has been almost two years since I've seen an anime movie that moved me. A Ghibli production, I should've known. While The Wind Rises did almost nothing for me, Isao Takahata's swan song maybe even trumped his debut (Grave of the Fireflies). It's almost impossible not to compare Hayao Miyazaki's final film to the one of Takahata. Both are founding fathers of Studio Ghibli and both announced their retirement in the same year. But unlike Takahata, Miyazaki's last work was a bit too much history and a bit too little fantasy. Something I really adore in Ghibli productions. Over all I like Miyazaki better than Takahata exactly because of the fantasy aspect in their works. Now the rolls are reversed: Miyazaki showed us his take on the interbellum in Japan through the eyes of Jiro Horikoshi, while Takahata brought us a captivating vision of one of the oldest Japanese folktales: ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter"" from the 10th century. His drawing is primitive and almost the antipode of Miyazaki's more refined style. Because of that I suppose some people will find this too childish or even amateuristic. I see it as an authentic and functional (an old tale requires not too sophisticated drawings) asset to this movie. For me it probably wouldn't have worked any other way. Last year I was a bit disappointed by the lack of truly majestic anime (referring to Wolf Children and A Letter to Momo) and after seeing The Wind Rises I gave up hope for this year too. Now that I've seen The Tale of Princess Kaguya, I again look forward to some new anime productions; Hiromasa Yonebayashi's When Marnie Was There in particular!"
66,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,25 December 2014,(spoilers!),"WARNING: Contains spoilers! (This is also for the Japanese version)Perhaps one of the most anticipated movies this year (for us non-Japanese), Princess Kaguya had me both worried (all the hype) and so excited (it's Studio Ghibli), but when I finally watched it, it was worth the wait, the anxiety and the hype. The animation style is simplistic yet exquisitely done in that simplicity: it echoes the traditional Japanese art and style you won't see in modern-day anime, which I'm not saying is bad, but ""Kaguya"" is a refreshing breath of air. The voice acting is superb, as is the norm with Ghibli's productions, and the choice of music and songs are almost heartbreakingly beautiful (the harvest song especially). The plot is a little slow and... well, non-exciting, as it is essentially a tale of a girl waiting to be married off: this plot takes up the majority of the film, but the subplots of Kaguya's wishes versus her father's hopes, is constantly there and the viewer is moved by the protagonist's simple desires and wishes. While it lacks the action of its predecessors, it makes up for it with the sheer joy of its own being: once again, the music, animation and characters themselves bring so much life to it.I would recommend it to anyone who likes Studio Ghibli, and maybe a few tissues for the ending which is rather bittersweet."
67,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,19 December 2014,One step closer to enlightenment,"If you contemplate life and our place on this planet, then this is an important movie to watch. The animation is really beautiful and the story is thought-provoking and deeply emotional(Loved it). I sat there in awe long after the credits rolled.Love, happiness, joy, sadness, despair, earth, mother nature, expectations, values and the whole mystery of life are some of the subjects this movie touches upon.If you understand the message that this movies tries to convey, then I'm sure you would have the urge to get off your ass and really start living. That's how powerful it was. Watch it. ENJOY IT! Studio Ghibli never disappoints =D"
68,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,21 January 2015,Spectacular Story Presented Perfectly,"I am writing this while I was watching the movie and just 30 mins left..We forgot, we forgot a lot and this movie shows us how we did it. We forgot the harmony in life and we forgot where the beauty of life actually located. We are drowning in our swamp we created. We forgot to give the real value to the valuable things. We forgot nature, friendships, we forgot everything we've learned...These are my thoughts and feelings while I was watching it. And gonna finish my comment, after finishing watching the film.....and yet, we always understand the value of the things when we loose it or while we are loosing it. This is the main subject of the movie.Musics, songs! They were amazing.It really worths to watch and spending your 2 hours for this hilarious anime and I really am congratulating all staff made this."
69,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,28 December 2014,Creatively made with great animation and storytelling.,"The story follows a Japanese folk tale and according to my Japanese friend, the film correlated with 80% of what she knew of the tale. Princess Kaguya is found by the Bamboo Cutter growing from a shoot in the forest. She fits into the size of his palm but soon becomes a rapidly growing baby. He decides to raise her as a Princess with his wife, deeming that the Heavens wanted so. However, Princess Kaguya receives many suitors and she feels stifled with her new status. Directed by Isao Takahata.Though the animation is not what we have become used to, it strongly portrays the emotions of the characters as well as enforces the mood of the scenes. It felt very expressionistic but was also vivid and bright at times, like an endless steam of paintings (though technically that is what animations are).There was this one scene which depicted Princess Kaguya running in the face of adversity and you could really tell that the animation were drawings with some very obvious pencil lines. However, it showed the act of fast movement really well and paired with dark colours to compliment the mood. That scene stood out to me and was exceptional in my opinion.I do feel that it could've cut short a few scenes. It's about 2 hours and 17 minutes long and during the middle it seemed to drag for awhile. It was not boring, but I was tired enough to be very sleepy and actually closed my eyes once or twice in the middle. Plus, the theatre seats were not very comfortable.Also, there was this one part near the end where something seemed to have happened but then it was totally disregarded and I'm left wondering what just happened. I can't tell much without giving it away but it just lost its continuity for a bit there. Oh, and there was the appearance of a certain religious figure that caused some discrepancy with what I knew of Japanese culture as well. It came as quite a shock to see that figure appearing almost randomly. I hadn't realized there was another Studio Ghibli film out, and I'm glad I caught this even though it wasn't in the mainstream cinemas. And though Hayao Miyazaki has retired and had no input in this, the film still stands up to its Ghibli reputation.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
70,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,3 November 2014,Makes you nostalgic for a time past,"In the first half of the movie, I wanted to join the lead character in her idyllic world hearkening of a time past, a culture past, and an animation style long since abandoned in mainstream ""cartoons."" Only having watched several Asian movies did it prepare me for a bittersweet second half. Having said that, it was torture sitting that long in the movie hoping for a different outcome than what we would eventually be presented. I don't know the source folk tale the movie was based on but I do see traces of the Little Mermaid in it. It just shows how universal some fairy tale themes are and how they are altered just a tad depending on the culture. If I was basing my enjoyment just on the last half and it's length, I would give this a lower rating. However, I am basing this on the fact that Studio Ghibli continues to put out meaningful movies, ala, ""Graveyard of the Fireflies."" While there is a place for fantastical worlds and Disneyfied endings to fairy/folktales for the occasional escapism one needs to take in life, the source material for those Disney movies were very dark. I think it's necessary to fill one's childhood with a good balance of both because life doesn't always go how you want. There was nary a child in my showing which is a shame because I think mature children could have enjoyed this as well. The surprise in my showing was that there were so many men in the audience who did not look like they were drug there by a wife or girlfriend. Maybe they are like me with a love for Studio Ghibli and anything they do."
71,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,23 February 2015,original language,"i really love the movie, but i didn't get why Cloe Grace Moretz is in the cast, i mean, the original language of this movie is Japanese, so , i don't get it, does she know Japanese or she translate the movie for a English version, the she shouldn't be in the cast , nothing against her, but the cast should be the original, no the translate, in the other way if she does know Japanese, then its amazing, and should be a great fact which should be in the general description of the page where everybody can see it, if someone know this please let me know, it will be great if she have actually really does the original voice of the princes."
72,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,5,21 August 2016,The Tale of Princess Kaguya,"There was a slight controversy surrounding this cartoon movie from Japanese Studio Ghibli, that it got the nomination at the Academy Awards, and The Lego Movie was not included, but it's almost no surprise as it follows the nominations tradition, directed by Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies). Basically a Bamboo Cutter (James Caan) is cutting down shoots, when he sees a shoot glowing, cutting it down he is shocked to find a baby girl growing inside, he takes her home where he and his wife (Mary Steenburgen) raise her as their own. Like a shoot of bamboo, the child who they call ""Princess"", is growing at a fast rate, earning her the nickname ""Little Bamboo"" from the local children, her adoptive father is protective for some time, but she becomes independent and makes real friends. Now a fully grown adolescent girl, and given the name Kaguya (Chloë Grace Moretz) by a priest, the Princess and her parents have become rich from another magical shoot of bamboo filled with a priceless gold substance, and they change to a higher class of living. Kaguya enthrals all who meet her, and being a mysterious beautiful young woman she gains the attention of many eligible men, specifically five men from prestigious families propose marriage to her, to help her decision who she will marry she asks each of them to find a memorable treasure and gift, including near impossible to find jewels. The men all find their task to prove their love and marry Kaguya impossible, with some of the men giving up and some trying to fake completing their task, eventually she is surprised to be proposed to by the Emperor of Japan. However, Kaguya finds out she must return to the Moon, where she came from, she is told she will be freed of all Earth's impurities, but also all her memories will be erased, she is granted a few moments to say goodbye to tearful parents, but in the end she floats away on a cloud going into the distance. Also starring Darren Criss as Sutemar, Lucy Liu as Lady Sagami, Beau Bridges as Prince Kuramochi, James Marsden as Prince Ishitsukuri, Eraser's Oliver Platt as Lord Minster of the Right Abe, Hynden Walch as Me no Warawa, Lois & Clark's Dean Cain as The Mikado, Daniel Dae Kim as Great Counselor Otomo, George Segal as Inbe no Akita and John Cho as Middle Counselor Isonokami. The cast dubbing the voices into English are all chosen well for their parts, the story is based on an old folk tale, it may be a little longer than it needs to be, have strange narratives, and be dull in places, but it has the right amount of emotional stuff to keep you watching, and you cannot deny the draughtsman style animation, not the same as past Studio Ghibli productions, is very good, overall it is an enjoyable animated fantasy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Worth watching!"
73,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,3 November 2015,A beautiful film that awakens one's inner child,"Inspiration is hard to come by, the finer the art you find the harder it is to find something that touches you. Tale of Princess Kaguya has the ability to enlighten your mind if you're willing to let it. This is the kind of film that leaves one somehow filled up, a sense of contentment that is inexplicable yet entirely tangible on an emotional level. The characters are full of the wide ranging human emotion that many have come to expect from 'Ghibli films, giving the audience; belly laughs, awe, sadness, despair, and happiness. Studio Ghibli wastes no time in revealing the magical elements within the tale, in the introduction a magical birth of a tiny child happens deep in a bamboo forest that leaves a kindly elderly couple in awe and adoration. Feeling blessed they embark on giving the magical child the best care they can give to her. As soon as we see Kaguya spring in to action, all the joyfulness of films such Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service and Howl's Moving Castle is reborn. This was something that I was very happy to see having found recent Ghibli films to be lacking the trademark otherworldliness that I have come to love.However, the film is not in entirely the same vein as many other Ghibli films, particularly in the animation department. The style comes across as much more minimalistic but equally as beautiful as any of their work thus far. It pays homage to ancient Japanese bamboo painting techniques, a style that I would imagine is painstaking to animate, yet it is gracefully brought to life. The ancient setting and style of the film gives the audience what feels like a genuine insight into medieval Japan, the customs, the fashions, attitudes, they all feel authentic and, for want of a better word, informative. I don't want to give away much more about this story so I will finally say that The Tale of Princess Kaguya is a must for any Ghibli fan, don't let the uncharacteristic animation style put you off seeing this beautiful tale. It's something the whole family can enjoy too."
74,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,1 November 2015,A movie that makes your mind fly away,"Although I have seen a lot of movies from all genres I never felt the desire to write a review until today. This movie brought that side of me it seems.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya has a simple fairy tail story with a slow-paced beginning and maybe that is why some people may find it boring, but, it's true essence lays in the powerful messages that are delivered throughout. The movie deals with problems that human kind has always confronted with such as the true meaning of life which may differ from person to person, the absurd and obtuse way the men treated their wives and daughters for centuries and death and how it affects the loved ones. But the one that I really appreciated is that we should enjoy every second of this mortal life, no matter if it is good or bad, the important thing is that we feel something; without bad things we will not be able to appreciate and enjoy the good ones at its true value.The soundtrack is really incredible and it gets better and better until the very end, making the movie experience so much enjoyable and is very fitting with the situations that the characters are getting through or with the places they are in.As a big fan of movies that makes you think, those being my favorite kind, I believe this movie is a masterpiece that gets you into the meditating state and makes your mind fly away."
75,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,23 October 2015,Beautiful Animation,"It really is hard to put across how beautiful the animation is in this movie - whilst I expect no less from the artists/Studio in question, this movie made me want to pick up a pen and draw as each line felt perfectly placed and simply stunning. It's a zany fairy tale story (and not particularly western, but all the more refreshing for it) that is simple and heart warming and it's told with a lot of thought and care put in to every moment. The English dub (I had to watch with this due to the small screen size making the subtitles option impractical for my viewing) is read beautifully and the songs and wisdom of the words is translated without any loss of meaning or impact.I've had this film on my ""to watch list"" for sometime and my biggest regret is taking so long to get to it - and I'm looking forward to watching it again soon!"
76,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,12 October 2015,Not your average flick!,"Since the day I watch The Tale of Princess Kaguya (2013), all of the animated feature's impossible to forget details have permanently ingrained inside my head. The watercolor-like visuals are beautiful, the characters' expressions are genuine and the whole feature is just so captivating.Not only you will be able to observe Japanese culture, you will also be able to watch helplessly hilarious and sometimes depressing traits of human beings. True that some of the scenes could be strange or even confusing but if we understand the underlying message of this Japanese folktale, we can learn invaluable life lessons from just watching this. Overall, you may find watching The Tale of Princess Kaguya (2013) a haunting experience due to the nature and the style of the this animated feature.Nonetheless, I won't say The Tale of Princess Kaguya (2013) is perfect as there are several aspects I do not like, but there are certainly more aspects to like than dislike. Due to that, this animated feature is possibly one of the best retelling of Japanese folktale in films. Therefore, it is one of my favorite animated feature of all time.As expected of Studio Ghibli's co-founder director Isao Takahata; The Tale of Princess Kaguya (2013) is unique in its own charm. I have seen the original Japanese version and I am pleased to report that this animated feature is definitely not your average flick. The ending is slightly weird but you will leave all sorrow behind after watching it."
77,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,17 September 2015,Little Bamboo! Little Bamboo!,"Takahata's Kaguya is based on the Japanese folktale The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, considered one of the first early examples of prose. It's a very Eastern narrative - Kaguya is part of a divine race who lives on the moon, and despite her highs and lows on Earth, is destined to return someday. I am reminded of a similar Chinese folktale, about a beautiful but vain woman who abandoned her earthly life and husband in an attempt to reach the heavens, but flew much too short, and was destined to spend the rest of her days on the moon. Neither reach the gut wrenching lows of Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies, but Kaguya's tale is tinged with hints of regret, nostalgia, and longing for various things. It's an increasingly rare but stunning example of traditional style animation, as per Ghibli standards. This one is even more unique. The old folktale is brought to life from its traditional roots; dark lines streak across the frame and fade out as if the brush needs more ink, splashes of watered down colours seep into the picture, and like the old scroll paintings, the background is often non-existent, blank and white. This is both good and bad - in some instances the film demands that the depth of the background be visible in order to immerse you into the world: the bustling marketplace in the capital, but more importantly, the grassy hills and trees of the countryside that she treasures the most of all. It's less concerned with light and shadow and detail (like many animes) and more concerned with a simplistic and serene portrayal of the story. But it also lends itself to the film's emotion - in one particular scene Kaguya is frightened and angry at being a plaything for her father to parade and put on a pedestal, and so she escapes in an otherworldly manner into the wilderness. Immediately the colour palette is muted and the shadows grow large and frantic. The art suddenly becomes frenzied as if the painter is feeling the same thing as Kaguya; the lines are streaky and messy and chaotic, the watery smooth ink is replaced by rough charcoal outlines. It's something that cannot be captured in a still frame, her fluid and furious movement frenetic. Her brows furrow (for the last time in a while) in pain and anger as she sheds layers of fine robes and runs through the streets underneath a gigantic full moon (foreshadowing her past and future). It's a remarkable scene. This is similar to the suitor's hunt for the jewel of a water dragon's neck. This too is stunningly portrayed, imagination fully realised as the embodiment of the deep sea roars and splashes against the tiny boat. We know that such fantastic and terrible things do not exist on this Earth, but can't we pretend? I have seen some complaints about the runtime and how some sequences should simply be trimmed. I do not agree. Aside from the absurd notion that shorter is better, Kaguya's life on Earth is much more substantial when showing us everything; every stolen honeydew melon in the summer heat, every childhood song, every delicious communal pheasant stew (or lack of). The way that the baby Kaguya's animation and story are handled is sublime and tender. True, she is still growing up way too fast (actually a device that is not needed, seeing as she slows down later in life to match the adult Sutemaru anyway). But we are allowed to grow up with her, every step along the way. Another director might have utilised a two minute or so montage to illustrate her early years, especially those first steps as a toddler. Takahata allows us to take delight in growing up with our very own little bamboo. Hisaishi's scores is up to his usual standards, with one track, The Procession of Celestial Beings, being the standout. It's a lively tune that trades the grace and serenity of the xylophone, triangle and flute with the heavier majesty of the brass and strings. At first I found it a little jarring, but on refection it's oddly appropriate. For the moon people, it's of course a celebration that their princess is returning. It's a stark contrast to the tragic farewell of Kaguya to her earthly life. Another thing, the English dub is surprisingly good (although it is Ghibli). Often I preferred it to the original Japanese because Moretz is less shrill and softer, more mature as she should be. For the few instances of singing however, the Japanese is a must, more beautiful and sincere than the awkward translation. And of course the songs are vital to the narrative. True, the themes are simple and we've seen it before. The longing for the idyllic childhood, the rough damsel in a refined society, the rebellion against parental and societal expectations, the what-could-have-been romance etc. But it's done with such nuance and emotional depth. We have the father, who's good intentions become a classic desperation for status and wealth and recognition in the ignorance of his daughter's true desires. Kaguya's struggle is something we have all experienced before in some ways, but her individual circumstances are tragic. Even with all the male suitor's fighting over her sexuality and her unhappiness with conforming to the court, her earthly existence is a meaningful one compared to an eternally stagnant nirvana on the moon. How many films can elicit such pain and nostalgic longing with such a simple but haunting song? The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is about life after all, the ebbs and flows of joy and sadness, the sudden but inevitable end. If Hollywood has made this, it would be about life too, but it'd be an optimistic bildungsroman. Not that there's anything wrong with that of course, but we do need more films like this."
78,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,3 September 2015,The Tale of Princess Kaguya,"Based on the tenth century Japanese folktale, 'The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter' this film opens with a bamboo cutter being attracted to a shining bamboo shoot; suddenly it grows and opens to reveal a tiny person. He rushes home and shows his with; then suddenly the tiny person starts to grow into a normal baby. There is something magical about her; the childless bamboo cutter's wife suddenly starts producing milk and the child, dubbed 'Little Bamboo' by the village children grows at an extraordinary rate as events cause a spurt of instant growth. As she grows she starts befriending the local children and believes she will stay with them forever. However her father has found more mysterious bamboo shoots; one containing gold and another containing exquisite silks; he takes this as a sign that she truly is a princess and uses his newfound wealth to establish himself and his family in the capital. Here, when she comes of age, she is given the name Princess Kaguya. She is trained in the ways of being a princess and powerful admirers who have heard of her great beauty seek her hand in marriage but she yearns for rural friends and sets her suitors impossible tasks. Eventually the Mikado takes an interest in her but again she declines she then reveals that in a few days she must return home; not to the bamboo forest but to her true home far, far away.Coming from Studio Ghibli's Isao Takahata it is not surprising that this film is both beautiful to look at and something rather different. The designs, which look like a mix of water colours and charcoal gives the film an ethereal feel that is entirely in fitting with the story. The story is told at a gentle, some might say slow, pace but there are bursts of energy where the animation becomes more chaotic in a way that beautifully captures the energy and emotion of the scenes. The story itself is rather melancholic; the bamboo cutter believes his 'daughter' will have a better life in the capital and he certainly enjoys it there but she just wants to be with her old friend and has no desire to be a princess. In many ways this makes it the opposite of many western fairy tales were a poor girl finds happiness when she meets her Prince Charming who whisks her off to a life of a princess.In summary; I found this film to be an utter delight a lovely but melancholy story that is beautifully told. While the story is suitable for all I suspect the gentle pace and long run time may mean it will be better appreciated by older viewers.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles."
79,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,31 July 2015,Terrific story but that's about all,"I love anime. I own several anime DVDs. This will not be one that I buy. It has one really terrific thing going for it: the story. The story is excellent, compelling and fascinating. But that's all that's wonderful about it.I did not like the artwork a single bit. I hope it doesn't start some sort of new faddish trend in anime. I believe they used the drybrush technique. That technique has it's place in the art world but I don't care for it in anime. This anime looks like it was drawn with chalk on rough paper by children. Very few outlines are closed and few if any areas are completely colored. All the voices are OK except for James Caan who, with his harsh Bronx accent is completely inappropriate in any anime. I like his work but not here."
80,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,29 May 2015,A masterpiece,"The tale of princess Kaguya is one of the best films I've ever seen.The animation has an original style of ""unfinished"" draws that combined with the watercolor based pallet, gives the movie a tone of poetry and emphasizes the ""beauty of the simple"". Its fascinated to see that a single brush line can represent many things even if its placed in frame full of details.The director was able to give a deep meaning to the traditional Japanese tale. The movie is open to different interpretations such as a metaphor of the cycle of life which subtly exposes the condition of every life form to be born,grow up and die. Every aspect placed in a poetically way.Regarding to be your interpretation the movie is by itself an astonishing masterpiece of animation."
81,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,28 March 2015,Truly stunning and quite possibly Studio Ghibli's best since Spirited Away,"While I have not seen Song of the Sea yet, from personal opinion The Tale of the Princess Kagua was the best of the nominees. It is a stunning film and, while the Ghibli films since Spirited Away are all worth seeing at least once(with only Tales from Earthsea disappointing somewhat) and as great as Howl's Moving Castle and The Wind Rises are, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is the best since Spirited Away without being one of Ghibli's very finest.It has and will alienate some viewers though, it is long, goes at a slow pace and elements of the story- for those unfamiliar with the old Japanese folktale it's based on- have gone and will go over people's heads. Neither of those however bothered me at all. The best things about The Tale of the Princess Kaguya are the animation and the music. The animation is just exquisite, Ghibli's best-looking since Spirited Away in which all their films since is the animation's the most consistently good asset of all of them, with everything looking so colourful and delicate and with an animation style quite unique to what's been seen before. Joe Hisaishi's music score is stirring, haunting and beautifully elegiac, it fits perfectly with the film's mood and is a wonderful score on its own, one that is guaranteed to have people rushing to find the CD if available and buy it.The story is divisive but to me it worked just fine. It seems simple structurally but the film does much with it that it doesn't feel simple, what occurs is engaging, thought-provoking and incredibly touching while not trying to make things too complicated. What stood out was the ending, one that was completely unexpected but also one that is beautifully melancholic and emotionally heart-breaking. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya's thoughtfully scripted, has some elements of whimsy and flows well and while the characters are archetypal they still engage. The voice acting is very good, with the Japanese version even better than that. In the English dub, which for this viewer wasn't bored-sounding at all, Chloe Grace Moretz voices with a lot of spirit, James Caan is authoritative and Mary Steenburgen is sympathetic and dignified with her Narrator being the stronger of her two roles.Overall, a stunning film, may alienate some but as seen will captivate most. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
82,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,23 March 2015,A piece of artwork to cherish,"Being a Ghibli lover, I watched this movie with a good preparation in order to appreciate the work of M.Takahata. I was a bit hesitant to see this particular movie after seeing Miyazaki's film (the wind rises) because I knew Takahata can make such emotional scenes and this will sadden you for days (like The grave of fireflies) The tale is already a fantastic tale,and the style and animation is matching perfectly the story. This is an artistic work, not something you throw after consumption. This is directed to people who can appreciate a drawing , a poem, a landscape and dream with it. Not only, the movie will rise so many emotions in you but it will also take your expectations to a higher level and ends with the most majestic scene you can imagine."
83,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,10,22 March 2015,An ancient legend becomes a modern masterpiece.,"Even having understood its exceptional nature, this film took me a good amount of time to emotionally process and I took it upon myself consider its many themes. The result? I came to the conclusion this is a masterpiece of a film.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is far more mature than an R rated film and far more complex than the Oscar-bait films we receive year after year. This is a story of a girl having her happiness destroyed by others. It critiques patriarchy and even Feudal Japan tradition. It resonates on the human condition and both the beauty and pain brought about by life. It's heart-wrenching and tragic. It's beautiful and enjoyable. It will leave you unsure and uncomfortable, but in awe of its storytelling.This film isn't afraid to add depth to its characters (especially its wonderful leading lady Kaguya), to present darkness and compelling themes in a medium still considered childish, and to proceed at a lengthy, but comfortable pace in order to properly explore its characters, themes, and storytelling. What we are left with is a multidimensional masterpiece that will likely be timeless.Other objects of merit are the fantastic Japanese and English dubbing, the beautiful naturalistic art style, and the utterly spectacular soundtrack. This film, despite being well-received, hasn't received the circulation it deserves in the US. Buy this film today. You owe it to yourself to experience the emotional currents of Kaguya's tale."
84,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,9,25 February 2015,Simply A-mazing!,"Time and time again, we learn that the simpler we make things, the more enduring and beautiful the outcome. This film goes back to the old way of animation - good ol' hand-drawn images, and it delivers the punch needed to floor any family member. Yes, this is a family film that'll bring tears to everyone's eyes. Granted, it is not quite as beautiful (and sad) as Grave of the Fireflies, but it not far behind in terms of it's sentimental storyline and lead child characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, especially the unpredictable ending. I usually stay away from fairytale infused Japanese films, but this one is an exception well worth the 2 hours. I would recommend listening to the original Japanese audio, not the American dub version."
85,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,8,8 February 2015,Beautiful & Poetic,"A gorgeous movie! Kaguya Hime was maybe a tad too long but it has so many beautiful moments, so many scenes that will take your breath away and so many scenes that will move you that overall it's hard to say anything negative about it. Director Yahata manages to take a basic folk tale and make it a universe, complete with beautiful settings and characters, and this is no small feat. The characters in particular are incredible: from their designs to their voice acting (in Japanese at least) and clear personalities, they are a high point of the movie (the 5 princes!) Yahata has shown a delicacy and sense of harmony & pace that is very different from Miyazaki's and somewhat more subtle...? and this movie deserves the praise it is getting."
